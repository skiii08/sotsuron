The King's Speech," Great acting, but nothing unexpected
","There is absolutely nothing wrong with this film. Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush play marvelously, the sets are perfect, the direction great. However, that was all to be expected. It is true that Mr. Firth needed to prove to people that he can act in stuff different from silly romantic comedies, but I knew he was a great actor. Same goes for Geoffrey Rush. The idea for the plot is in the history books. All one has to do here is not screw it up, and they didn't.So, from a pure technical standpoint, the movie deserves a perfect ten. From a personal viewpoint, though, it was only a good movie, nothing spectacular. As such, I can't rate it highest, because I know I saw movie that I liked a lot more, at a level of perfection much inferior than King's Speech.Bottom line: There are no twists, there is nothing really surprising in the film. Everybody does their job and presents the story perfectly. It's a good movie, but not a very enticing one.",9,0,1,27 January 2011
The Lobster," Deconstructing social pressure
","This is a fracking weird movie. It's all about how society pressures one to be in a certain way, thus depriving them of their humanity. The entire film is metaphorical: the dialog, the long shots in which people are small and meaningless, the way people talk without emotion, the narrator - at least in the beginning - which with a droning voice works against the character on screen, the structured dehumanization.I can't say I liked it, but it has an original idea and it is acted really well. A good cast as well. Reminded me of Dogville, a movie that I couldn't watch. Same approach of doing something different from what is expected with really known actors. It feels like a play. It feels European. If feels like art.Bottom line: it's one of those you either love it or hate it films, but you at least respect it.",9,3,7,25 May 2016
The Avengers," 'Superheroes in New York? Give me a break!' or 'Skarsg√•rd vs Asgaard'
","This film can only be rated in contrast with other superhero movies and, as such, it's above average. The only way it can be described is a Marvel extravaganza. When one gladiator doesn't excite the crowd anymore, you bring out the whole ludus!But of course, what many people forget about comic book superheroes is that they came from, well, comic books. They have stories that people have thought out long before there was any idea of making a movie. Not the best literature can provide, but something like character development and a plot. So if you bring all these stories together, you'd better be careful how you do it.I am glad to say that The Avengers did not botch this. The story was reasonable. The fighting scenes were epic, even if totally unrealistic, the special effects grandiose, but not overly so. The motivational speeches and ridiculous pomposity down to a minimum and there were even some funny jokes in. All in all, I had fun watching the film.",8,2,6,1 September 2012
Blade Runner 2049," A really good sequel
","In order to judge a film, you compare the direction, the acting, the story and the production values to similar movies from the same category. How nice that we have just such movie in the original Blade Runner. On each of the above metrics, this is a much better film.One of the few things that Blade Runner had better than the sequel is the supporting characters. As Deckard goes around following replicants and growing as a character, so do the replicants themselves. In the sequel, Ryan Gosling does an amazing job, but the focus is mostly on him and very little on the other characters. That's not to subtract from Ana de Armas' acting, which proves (again?) that she is the perfect woman in every respect. And if the original film had to invent the visuals and even explored the world a bit, 2049 does little to improve on that, even takes some away (only a few scenes have more people and vehicles at the same time, the rest being ridiculously empty for something that should happen in the future, for example).Acting is great, direction is great, the visuals are impressive - and this is one of the few movies I believe are worth going for in the cinema or at least having a nice sound system at home when you watch it - the story is both intriguing and well paced, the sound and mood are perfect.Perhaps the villains are the ones that are the least interesting; they almost hurt the movie. I can't explain it without spoiling too much, but at some time there are two factions that kind of want the same thing, but act like bitter enemies. There is a scene where Edward James Olmos is brought in for nothing other than nostalgia and Dave Bautista may not be the greatest actor in the world, but what was he doing in just a few scenes? Did he ask to be put in the film because he loved Blade Runner? And Jared Leto... I believe he terrorized his mates with this method acting a lot more than he actually acted on screen!Bottom line: I think it is important to watch the first Blade Runner before you watch this. Don't even rely on memory, just rewatch the original first, then see this one. An almost perfect film that makes you feel something other than ear pain from explosion sounds. Plus it has a sexy scene with Ana de Armas and Mackenzie Davis overlapping. That's got to be worth going to watch the movie in full 3D!",9,3,9,5 November 2017
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," I feel like I should only add half the title here: Review, part 1
","Every story has some elements and they usually are in the same order. You have the hook, you have the set up, the character descriptions, some action, some life changing decisions, the twists and so on. Since part 1 of part 3 is just half a story, you only get the set up! The hook is presumably in the first two movies, but let's say we have a weak one at the beginning of the film, as well. And then it goes something like 'Tomorrow... Panem!' and the movie ends.One year later, you get the second movie, which starts where this one ended and it's overly long and obviously artificially so. However, Part 1 is not so bad. In fact, I would say it is definitely better than the second part. The characters are described, their motivations laid bare, we only need the action stuff, that doesn't really happen here. However this slowness of pace is also what forces the actors and movie makers to improve on the quality of the exposition.That doesn't make it a great movie, but it is a decent one, and it certainly raises expectations.",7,1,4,30 November 2015
Black Swan," To hell and back
","Hard to discuss the subject of the movie without giving it away. I suggest anyone wanting to see a powerful, tenseful movie to watch this, without reading any reviews. However, it is one of those films that remains strong even when you know what its subject is.Ironically enough, it is about a great performance and it is expressed cinematographically via a great performance, that of Natalie Portman. I can't imagine how it was for her to actually play the role, but it must have been a little terrifying. The transition from ballet role to real life role and back again is shattering the actual person inside, the one that only wants to feel perfection and become complete through art.Bottom line: it is a frighteningly beautiful film, one that expresses the inner hell of a person that everyone around puts pressure on. It might be too hard to witness, but it is a great movie.",9,2,5,23 January 2011
Men in Black 3," A worthy film in the franchise
","The first Men in Black was mostly a comedy. It set up the stage, presented the actors and managed to do a little extra on the side, but it was a proof of concept mostly, with many a laugh and lots of goofiness. The second movie had the setup, but it wasn't nearly as funny or active; it basically flopped.The third movie saves the day. It solves the second movie by ignoring it completely and using the same story in a better way: Agent J gets to save K again. The film also ties things up nicely and puts the original film in perspective. The villain acts a bit goofy, but is very well designed and positively scary. Brolin does a great agent K. It seemed Tommy Lee Jones had to be heavily made up in order to appear remotely interesting and his role was minimal. Even better are the introductions of interesting people in the cast: Emma Thompson as a romantic interest of K's, Jemaine Clement of Flight and the Conchords fame as the bad alien (the humans are not dead yet, Jemaine!) and lovely Alice Eve in a too tiny a role as young Agent O (and may I say what a perfect operative nickname they found for her).Bottom line: some people did not like it. I have no idea why. Probably it had to do with expectations that were set up 10 years ago and then took lives of their own. The script is subtle, but effective, the acting is good, the 1969 atmosphere is not really accurate, but it doesn't matter so much and there is real humour, not just weird aliens doing silly things. Will Smith was great in his first role in about 4 years. All in all, I liked the film.",8,2,4,27 September 2012
Howl's Moving Castle," Great anime, very imaginative
","I enjoyed this movie almost as much as Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke. You meet here the same magic world, with witchy grannies, courageous boys and girls motivated by love, silly warmongers with their little guns, people turning to demons when they succumb to their evil emotions. Basically you have a world on the brink of technology and also magic, the power of both being controlled by the human heart.It's a great film to watch, the music is a little to soapy for my taste, the animation great, the characters are interesting, but I couldn't relate to any of them, this maybe being the bad side of the movie (or maybe my bad side :) ), the story is nice and the ending happy. If you are a Miyazaki fan, this is a must for you.",9,2,4,9 June 2005
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Same steampunkish perspective of books that were nothing like the sort
","If you have seen the first installment of the franchise, you come with certain expectations. Well, those expectations are met in full, as A Game of Shadows has the same feel as the first film. Now, however, people cannot nag that this is supposed to be a prequel to Doyle's books and thus the youthful superhero stuff is not utter tosh, but some sort of smart reimagining. No, it is not. It's just special effects poured generously on a transparent thin copy of the original stories. Sherlock Holmes is extremely brilliant, but he doesn't even explain much what his deductions are. He barely has the time, since he is in gun fights and explosions half the movie.The only reason I did not fail the film is the presence of Jared Harris, who we see more and more often in American productions such as Fringe or Mad Men and he is great in all of them. As things stand, I really wish they would resurrect Moriarty in the third part, rather than replace Harris with some nondescript villain.",7,0,1,23 April 2012
The Monuments Men," Bland mix of propaganda loosely based on real events
","I couldn't connect to the movie at all. It started like a WWII Ocean's Eleven, but the people in the 'gang' had no chemistry and their characters were not expanded enough for the viewer to care. A lot of great actors in mediocre roles which were badly written.Then there was the script itself. A lot of 'oh, how horrible the Germans are' and 'how civilized and caring are the Americans', with a bunch of other nations that were so sketchy that no one really cared about them. There were a few scenes that surprised me, like the one with the German soldier who just smokes with some of the Americans, then leaves. In a such cartoonishly one sided film, I was amazed to see that even Germans were human, a courtesy that was not extended to the Russians, for example.Bottom line: a film devoid of empathy, filled with propaganda complete with heroic soundtrack. I have no idea what the real Monuments Men were like, but I highly doubt they were the walking clich√©s depicted in this film. I had to make an effort to watch it all. In the end, I regretted even that.",6,1,1,11 May 2014
Lucky Number Slevin," Last Man Standing meets The Jackal and The Usual Suspects
","I might have said too much already in the title. The thing is that the plot of this movie can't be told without spoiling it. What I can tell you is that the recipe for the movie is bring good actors and use a non conventional twisting plot to make them shine. It worked for The Usual Suspects and it works for this one.If it weren't for the mellowed down ending, I would have given this film an 8. It is a good police thriller, with a tendency for over verbalization, but not too annoying, and thus worth watching. Bruce Willis doesn't save the day, that's also a plus, while Josh Hartnett plays his role well. There are a lot of known actors in the movie, with 'Oh, I know this guy/chick' moments all the time, but that doesn't mean they all have significant roles. My biggest disappointment was that both Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman had unimportant, clich√©d playing.Conclusion: it's worth seeing, yet be warned that it uses fast talking and a lot of US cultural references in order to make the actors look better than their roles. If your English and love for movies are not very good, watch it with a good translation, none of that 'I'm 10 and I think I can translate movies by using an automated translator program' crap.",7,3,10,11 June 2006
Your Name.," It was very beautiful, but also quite derivative
","Watching the trailer I thought this is going to be like Voices of a Distant Star or the myriad of similar anime since. Same nice scenery, piano music, long space and time communication , the touching of two people's souls (of course, high school boy and girl). And it was! Up until half of the movie. Then the original idea of the script kicked in and saved the story. I have to say that for people who have never watched Japanese anime this should be quite beautiful, but for long time fans it touches all the right buttons in a sort of mechanical and predictable way.It is a very beautiful romantic fantasy, but it sure felt very derivative. I know nothing is truly original, but as the movie ended (in a quite predictable manner), I wanted a little more - I don't know what. Perhaps more than the cardboard characters or the dusk lit countryside scenery with the piano music. The only interesting character for me was the senior waitress from where Taki worked. The rest were all the childish Japanese cliches that you see in all the anime.",8,0,0,10 November 2018
Captain Phillips," Oh, I thirsted for a good realistic movie
","The movie addresses a real case, the pirate hijacking of a US cargo ship near the Somali waters. Tom Hanks plays very well, as expected, although I found his character not very challenging most of the time. There are some scenes, though, that required an actor of Hank's caliber and he totally pulled through.Another thing I appreciated was that the film doesn't go over the top with drama or special effects. It is mostly a character driven film and both Hanks and Abdi are very good in their roles. As far as I could dig up, the film is also pretty realistic, true to the actual events. Needless to say, this is exceedingly rare in American 'based on real events' movies.An interesting fact is that this ship was the first US ship to be hijacked by pirates since 1815. It would have been a big blow to US if the pirates would have succeeded. The film hints of this in a single scene where the rescuers are instructed that Philips getting to Somalia is not an option, otherwise it is pretty difficult to understand why three US battleships participate in the rescue of a single man and why they were prepared to sink the rescue boat if the negotiations would have failed.All in all I am not sorry that I watched this film. It needs a certain 'real events' mood to enjoy it thoroughly. Well acted, well directed, I really needed a movie that was not disrespecting the viewer with pure fantasy or/and a shitty script and trying to compensate with pretty explosions.",8,0,2,6 January 2015
Sucker Punch," The visuals didn't save the movie
","When you look at the poster or the trailer of the movie you get the idea of a very creative movie, with lots of stunning graphics and interesting scenes. The reality of it (pardon my pun) is that the dragons and the orcs and the steampunk Nazis and the ninja swords are just a few of the scenes in the movie. The rest is a story that felt pushed and artificially dramatic.Bottom line: the film has stunning visuals and a great soundtrack. The plot, though, kind of sucks. You have insane people sacrificing themselves for no good reason and bad people getting anything they want, with the only consolation that an active imagination overcomes the drama of reality. It is an intriguing idea, one that I've loved in a number of films; in this one, however, it left me unimpressed.",7,1,3,9 July 2011
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Not as bad as I thought, but really saying absolutely nothing
","I really wanted to see this movie so as to be able to make fun of it in full knowledge. And I really expected something awful. The thing is, it wasn't that bad. The actors were OK, the effects were OK, the production values were OK. Nothing above average, but certainly not something terrible. The only problem with the film that I could not get over was the story. It said absolutely nothing! A lot of young people talk about their feelings, prepare for The Breaking Dawn part 2, then the film ends.So yeah, it is a pretty crappy feeling to wait an hour and a half for something to happen, then a woman gives birth in a creepy way (don't they all?) and the film ends with nothing to show for the lost time. And, as a spoiler, I did watch part 2 immediately afterwards and almost all of it was just the same. So, in my view, this is a single film with about two hours and a half of nothing, then some special effects, and then, again, a completely boring ending.",6,2,3,24 February 2013
10 Cloverfield Lane," Slow paced mystery thriller with some sci-fi thrown in for marketing purposes
","Some parts of the movie were great, some not so much. An unevenly good film with a great concept, good acting but some pacing problems. Since the whole idea of the film was to watch it without knowing anything about its story or concept, I suggest you do just that before you read any reviews.That being said, John Goodman was perfect for his role. He was equal parts a lovable teddy bear (check out the scene when he put on some music - LOL) and a really creepy crazy person. The other actors were OK, but I wouldn't call their performances great. The story is taking people you know nothing about and putting them in a situation where reality cannot be verified. When someone says or does something, you wonder if they are crazy or they are actually for real.In effect, the result is a slow paced character piece. It is not about sci-fi and it is not about what the hell is going on - even if you wonder about that the whole movie. It is about the people. However, since nothing is revealed until the end of the film and since you know nothing of the people to start with, it is very difficult to empathize with any of them, therefore it all feels like a too long escape from a room type of a game.The ending is just something that artificially connects this film with Cloverfield and tries to add the sci-fi tag to it. It makes little sense and in fact it is the reason why I only rated this movie as average.Bottom line: if not for JJ's pretentiousness, it would have made a really good Outer Limits episode. As such it feels too long and the ending just makes it feel fake. Too bad, it was a refreshing concept.",7,1,5,7 May 2016
The Equalizer," Home Depot Alone
","I guess this was exactly the kind of movie that it wanted to be: retired nice guy with amazing violence skills gets upset and starts killing people to satisfy his own sense of justice and self importance. Few people remember the Equalizer series, from 1985, starring Edward Woodward and even fewer would recognize similarities with this film, except the name. My guess is that Sony wanted this film to be a kind of pilot for a new TV series.What really *annoyed* me off was that everything was completely blown out of proportion. Denzel's character goes to help a girl (what else) and kills some Russian mobster in the most ridiculous way possible. But this was just an employee of a bigger mobster, so he sends an uber psychopath to solve the problem. And so this guy has to be killed, hostages enter the fray, captured in some Home Depot thingy, they play 15 minutes of Counter Strike inside, only with household appliances, and so on and so on. They replaced Woodward's brain with Washington's brawn and some ridiculous semblance of planning, since he always wears a stopwatch and measures time for some reason that is never explained.What can we learn from this film? First of all that if you are an ex-CIA killer you can just assume there is no justice in the world but your own. Also, the other people that could help, like the police, are just hired help for mobsters. And if you are a helpless normal citizen that has to work hard for the slightest pay raise, you will be beaten, sold as a slave, blackmailed when you make a little bit of money, perhaps by corrupt cops, and your only hope is some homicidal maniac who really enjoys killing people in creative ways after bullying them into taking the first shot (he calls this 'giving them a chance').Bottom line: a clich√© from top to bottom, this is like A History of Violence on steroids and making little to no sense. A feeler for a TV series that I hope will never be made, it just offends just about everything involved in the plot: the police, the Russian mobsters, any military organization that is not the CIA, democracy, the justice system in its entirety, laptop makers that are not Sony, Home Depot, Ernest Hemingway, Mexicans, fat people... Just say it's a completely average action movie and don't watch it.",6,4,6,30 December 2014
The Expendables 2," Dry jokes, obvious references, old men
","I really expected this film to be better than the first Expendables and in a way it was, but they clearly did not learn much of the experience. Same lame one liners referencing past movies, same enormous body count, same lack of real action. And the thing is, I am sure each one of the people in the movie could have packed a lot of punch. All they needed was some creative writing, something that would have shown unequivocally why these old timers are legends and better than the tens of drones that get shot down in the film.Alas, no such writing was in store for them. People just died from their bullets and missed all shots, the villain was called Villain, the girl was there just for the fun of it and the reason why they all did what they did felt completely artificial. I really, really, wanted to enjoy the film as much as I did the trailer. It was not to be.Bottom line: this film only emphasised that these actors are really old. They move around arthritically shooting bullets because they can't do much else. The plot only enhances the feeling. In the end, one feels sad for the characters, rather than exhilarated by their achievements or in awe of their talent. With good writing, this could have been insanely cool. Alas, good writers seem to be more expensive than a hundred people pretending to die from a single machine gun.",7,0,0,27 November 2012
Source Code," Enjoyable sci-fi, it felt more like a play
","The idea for the movie was really nice. I liked it a lot. The acting and technical values of the film were good as well. The two issues I have with Source Code are that they repeat the same scene a few times (couldn't be helped, given the plot, but still a bit annoying) and with the really weird reactions of everybody involved. The idea was good, the script was a little worse than the idea, but still good, but the dialogues were really unnatural. Given a better screenwriter, this could have been brilliant.That being said, I really liked the movie and do not regret choosing to see it. It may be one of the few films that are worth watching in a cinema, as the constraints of the theatre chair are forcing one to get into the feel of it. Also, since the entire action happens in a train, in a capsule and a military facility, and since the characters are few and really define the plot, it feels more like a play than a movie.",8,0,1,3 July 2011
Skyfall," New meets old and... make a nasty drink
","Skyfall has a number of good things going for it: Javier Bardem is a great actor and Ralph Fiennes, even with a really small role in this film, is wonderful as well. Naomi Harris I've loved from her role as Tia Dalm, even if in this film she also is just being set up, just like Ralph Fiennes. Daniel Craig does a good role, as well, but he has already proved himself in the previous film.However, all this potential is practically wasted in a confused script that attempts to make a circular link between the old James Bond, with the cars and the gadgets and the queen and country stuff, with the new Bond, where computers and strategy is paramount compared to physical stuff. And they really try too much, they achieve little and make yet another 'fallible Bond' film that pretty much bores people watching it in its two hours and a half.Bottom line: the starting credits have a complex visual background, heavy in computer graphics and hints on the film. The rest of the movie attempts to catch up with that which, I am sorry to say, is the best part of the film. Oh, and that guy Patrice is the husband of Noomi Rapace.",7,4,14,28 October 2012
Iron Man 3," Oh, no, another American president is in danger!
","When I rate a film, I do it in comparison with the others of his genre. Luckily, for Iron Man 3 I have two other movies of the exact same type available, so that makes it easier. Unluckily, this is by far the worst film in the series. It doesn't mean it's very bad, just that it fails comparatively.The story is that a vicious terrorist appears to 'teach lessons' to the American president and the US in general. All nice and beautiful, but before presenting this plot, it starts with Stark reminiscing about the past and presenting two major players. If it weren't for that, one would have kept asking oneself what is going on and kept a bit of the thrill on instead of guessing the plot from the get go.Afterwards, Iron Man gets his ass kicked. The manner is so simplistic an naive that it raises doubts about the entire franchise. Barely escaping he meets a kid that helps him out. Actually, that was the best part of the film. The kid story and their interaction was what saved this movie from being total special effects cr*p.Then the true horror is revealed with something so unlikely or believable that it made me laugh. You see, for terror and revenge, the villain has advanced the human race a few steps in its evolution and concomitantly solved any energy issues the world has ever had. Then Iron Man kicks his ass. Why?The ending was totally horrible, as a continuation of the start. Same lame voice explaining things, Stark realising he is the man and then a funny scene at the end, after the credits, which is not that funny.I have high hopes for Iron Man 4, though, as the villain can only be the biggest enemy of Starks: George R. R. Martin! Meanwhile, this film was weak.",6,1,5,7 August 2013
Deepwater Horizon," Corporate greed leads to disaster.
","It's the second movie I see in a row where Mark Wahlberg is presented as the heroic average guy. Do all Americans see themselves as former underwear models? The movie was OK. First show how good and professional and real people are the heroes of the story, demonize the middle management who wants to get things done hoping it will all be OK and risking everybody's lives, express the idea that money hungry sons of bitches are to blame, then blow everything up.The film presents only the actual event, with lots of fire, explosions, blow outs and debris flying everywhere. The lower on the corporate ladder people are the more heroic they appear. That's dramatization for you. I would have loved to have a small part in the end dedicated to the BP cover up and the legal mess afterwards, but they kept quiet. I don't even know if it was all cleared up by 2010. However, you should look up Peter Berg's article about BP's interference with the movie. Just look for 'The 'well from hell' ‚Äì my fight with BP to film Deepwater Horizon' and you'll find it.Bottom line: classic disaster movie, with a straight story of the event, rather than the entire political and legislative chaos that ensued.",7,2,3,24 September 2017
Stop-Loss," Modern day Rambo
","Remember Rambo the first? The movie that detailed the way soldiers are treated when returning from war? They are out of place, they bring all this baggage with them that all civilians just want to put aside. In the meantime, the military wants that soldier back in their killing machine.That's what this movie made me think of, although it was not Rambo-violent, just Rambo-ideological. Ryan Phillippe makes this movie even better, giving one of his best performances as yet. He is also changed physically, no longer just a pretty teenage boy, but a heavy muscled soldier man. If someone would have told me Ryan Phillippe would be good in the role of a Texan sergeant I would have laughed, but he made it fit like a glove.I will let you see the film for yourself and make up your own mind. It is a great anti-war movie and a slap on the face of all those back-seat warmongers out there. I highly recommend it.",9,2,8,26 July 2008
It," Stranger Things did it so much better
","I cannot say that IT is a bad movie, quite the opposite: it was well acted, scary, interesting. However, you have to naturally compare it with three things: the source material, the miniseries and Stranger Things, which was released just a year before and even featured one of the same actors in the film. And my personal opinion is that with this comparison, the film loses its shine. Admittedly, it only covers the first part of the IT story (with the obligatory sequels coming out soon), but still, it felt like it lacked courage. Compared to the book, only hints (and I am glad they added those) of the underlying themes in the book are found: the constant bullying of the redneck older kids, the adults ignoring with impunity the plight of kids around them, turning a blind eye to anything they weren't comfortable about, the creepy pharmacist and step dad, the sexual awakening of the kids. Oh, and before you say 'God, that girl is beautiful! I totally get the pharmacist.' Sophia Lillis is 15! I felt like the movie went too much in favor of special effects, while making the clown less potent, regardless of Bill Skarsg√•rd's great acting.  However, compared to Stranger Things, it was all done simply less well. Did the movie have to be set in the 80's? It had, because the second part has to be 27 years later and they didn't want to make the sequel in the future (although that would have been rad!). But considering that the group of bike riding geeky 80's kids has been done just a bit before, it felt old! Stranger Things went over the trope of 'bad kid always a bad kid' which the movie fully embraced. The characters, for a two hour long movie, were also less fleshed out like I would have liked them. The dynamics of the kid group were also better in the series. Bottom line: without comparing it, the movie is clearly above average, but I have to say that with the quantity and quality of ideas at their disposal, the film's team could have done more. I felt that they chickened out. This had the potential to blow Get Out out of the water with social commentary and focus on the real ideas King explored in the book. The movie had the opportunity to take the story and make it better. Instead, they went with a mere shoe shine of an adaptation that brought nothing new to the table.",7,0,1,17 March 2018
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," There was a book? Dear God!
","Hollywood finds new ways to amaze me all the time. For example I loathe movies that are cash traps for their viewers but also take themselves seriously, as if pretending they are actual art. But I am prone to dislike less a movie that is bad and doesn't pretend it isn't. Some people want no script and a lot of special effects and I have no problem with films that acknowledge that.Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is going one step further. By its title alone you can't possibly take it as serious and yet it goes so far to make it unbelievable that I can't not dislike it. It's like an encounter of the third kind (thus the triple negation earlier), an alien film that has nothing to do with history (American or vampiric), any sort of reality or even a bit of logic. Maybe vampires did it, some sort of dead things that can only drink the money and time of the people watching their movies.",6,1,2,17 October 2012
In Bruges," Blew away my expectations
","Forget all that Sundance crap. Regardless if you consider Sundance the protector umbrella of the last good scripts or just an overblown indie front, this movie is good! And it is good at more levels than one.The acting, first of all, is great. All the actors are top notch to a degree that I haven't seen in a long time. Colin Farrell does his usual bad boy performance, but he adds a lot of emotional dimensions to his act. Really good job. I like Ralph Fiennes, and he seems he got the 'bad bug' after he played Voldemort and he will be playing more negative roles from now on.The script is funny to laugh at and sad to cry. It is both complex in metaphors and simple enough to be enjoyed by anyone. A truly good script if I've ever seen one. A bit boring at the start, but hey, it was setting the stage for a great act.The music wasn't bad either, the location (a medieval burg in Belgium called Bruges) was nice, too. All in all, a must see. What the hell, I'll rate it 10 out of 10.",10,2,10,1 August 2008
John Wick," Don't they ever learn? Do not kill the dog!
","You have to watch this film knowing that its makers wanted to pay homage to manga, old style samurai movies and directors like John Woo. Everything is... ordered, like something in a Japanese film. There is a code for everything, a way to do things that has to be followed. That is why when the action starts and there are some obvious shortcuts to everything, people don't take them. I am pretty sure somewhere there is a Japanese samurai script or manga that they adapted and the original characters did everything with swords.The choreography is decent, with Keanu doing a combination of Matrix and Equilibrium moves that (finally!) are not all in slow motion. The basic plot is that his character gets angry and starts killing people and then the film ends. If you don't appreciate the style, then the film will be wasted on you.That being said, I have to say that I think the film was not that good. It was not bad, but there were opportunities missed to make it truly unique and memorable. As such, one enjoys the actions scenes then forgets the movie. One of these opportunities was to use the amazing cast they had. Forget that Bridget Moynahan had only a few scenes in some flashbacks and that sexy Adrianne Palicki was completely underexposed, but actors the like of Willem Dafoe and John Leguizamo should have been the bread and butter of the film. Instead, they were relegated to minimal supporting roles.Unexpectedly for the film, but totally expected of the actor, the best action scenes where those involving Daniel Bernhardt, who moved with the same grace and precision that he had when he did all those martial arts films in his youth. He was so good that it just showed he could have kicked Keanu's behind any time he wanted to.Another opportunity was a detailing of Wick's glory days. Instead we are treated with a monologue vaguely explaining how awesome and efficient Wick was when he was a contract killer. Really? He wasn't that way in the film! Keanu played his usual silent brooding self, but at least in one scene, the one where he shouts at Viggo to give him the son, he shows the potential that was lost in writing his character.Bottom line: a rather average action flick, feeling more like a video game than a samurai movie. Instead of minutes and minutes of nameless minions being killed, a strong contouring of the characters, at least of the main ones, would have been a lot more effective. Like many others, I am sure, I was attracted to see the movie by the cast which was, unfortunately, underutilized.",7,5,16,13 January 2015
Kung Fu Panda," It was funny, but rather bland
","The animated story of a fat panda dreaming to become a great ninja should have been about awkwardness, involuntary humour and overcoming one's limitations. This film was exactly that. The voice acting was top notch, the 3D animation good, the funny animal faces perfect. But it was so incredibly predictable, that it brought only a type of indifferent fun for me. Maybe it was because I have seen old Jackie Chan movies and I knew how things will go, PG rated and everything, but every single little scene was in my head before it happened.Bottom line: it is one of those funny American animations that you can easily laugh to, but that slip your mind the next day. You've got fat jokes, kung-fu jokes, funny faces, an angry misguided villain and the calm wise master; you've got animals acting like humans because it is funnier, not because it means anything to the story; you've got an easy effortless win from a natural talent. The secret ingredient was truly nothing.",7,1,1,9 December 2010
A Star Is Born," Not a bad movie, but immense marketing made it feel... err... Shallow
","The trailers are telling us the movie is about a young girl who makes it on stage thanks to a charismatic seasoned singer. Well, that happens after a quarter of the film. The rest is just drama: family drama, marriage drama, substance abuse drama, disease drama, industry drama, death drama. They only had to introduce some mobsters and a rape and they would have checked all the boxes. The marketing exploding out there is telling us that Bradley Cooper has an amazing voice and the Lady Gaga is an amazing actress. They are not bad, but certainly amazing is not how I would go. Lady Gaga has an amazing voice and Bradley Cooper is a great actor, though. So with all this in mind and without knowing this is a remake of a 1937 film that has been remade four times, I felt a little cheated. That is why I will rate it as average, although, objectively, it wasn't.The story is nice, not exceptional, we've all seen it before, but nice. The actors shine, though. Cooper is great, Sam Elliott plays a sympathetic character that didn't annoy me (for once) and he kind of steals the scene whenever he is in one, Gaga herself was pretty good, in the sense that I don't know if she meant to play it as the natural girl or she was just being herself. It's clear people loved making this film and so it's a pity to see the same corruption of the soul described in the movie happen to the film itself when marketing people get their hands on it.Bottom line: boy meets girl, they hook up, then the film actually begins.",7,0,3,18 January 2019
Gravity," Beautifully done. I loved that it was very technical.
","Normally I would have given this an above average mark, but not too large. The thing that made me grade it with a 9 is the decision to stick to technical details even if, as my wife proved it, some viewers might be put off by them. So, if you imagine that a movie with Clooney and Bullock must be a romance, don't go watching this film.The film is almost like a screen play with a lot of special effects. Practically there are only two actors, Sandra Bullock being the lead and George Clooney a supporting actor, with a few other actors voicing mission control and so on. The film is only superficially an action movie with the characters fighting for survival, with the real story the interactions of people with outer space and the feeling of isolation one gets over there. In order to fully understand the physics and orbital mechanics, I would direct you to (a lot of) space blog posts from specialists discussing and praising the accuracy of most of the concepts in the film.As for my subjective point of view, I liked the movie, but mostly because I am a space buff. Some of the scenes - like the one when Clooney untethers - were pointless, while others over the top with special effects and way too loud music. The soul of the movie, though, stands up to scrutiny and I am really glad Cuaron made the effort to bring his vision to the big screen.A lot of people recommended watching the film on the big screen in 3D. I did not have the opportunity, so I saw it low res on my computer. It's just as awesome. Perhaps for less technical people or uninterested in space, it would not be so pleasing. My wife did not enjoy it. For me, most of the concepts in the film were already known, but it was damn nice seeing them on the screen like that.",9,4,7,29 December 2013
Lone Survivor," Brutal and realistic, it opens eyes
","If there is one thing that this film will accomplish is to make you feel something. I assure you you will not get bored watching it. Now, what you will feel will no doubt be up to you.For myself, I felt mostly rage against a botched mission in an ineffective war. Raytheon should be annoyed that a movie about a mission failed primarily because of communication issues showed their red flashy brand on the comms equipment.I wanted the characters to succeed, to survive, but I could not ignore the fact that they were soldiers being there only to kill an enemy commander. Having all Americans die in slow motion while scores of Taliban died instantly and kind of stupidly didn't help with the empathy. Also showing pictures of dead soldiers with their families with a pathetic American remake of Bowie's Heroes singing in the background at the end of the movie just fueled more rage. People in the field try to carry out their mission and survive, while their deaths become political and mediatic material. I didn't enjoy that.On the other hand, the fights were realistic, the subject based on real events and, outside the pathetism described above, I did not detect a bias towards one side or the other. You will witness two hours of low tech war in all of its horror and stupidity. The actors also play well, although I like Mark Wahlberg in almost everything he does.The story, while showing the preparation, courage and resilience of four soldiers in enemy territory, also showed other things, like the logistical blunders that lead to stupid deaths, over-reliance on technology that doesn't really work as you expect and how choices have consequences on the ground that are beyond the ability of normal courts to understand, whether looking from the legal or moral angle.I liked a lot about the movie how it made you think long after it was over. What would have happened if they just killed the herders? What would have happened if they tied them up, went a bit down, risked a sniper shot at the enemy commander, then just ran? What would have happened if the Pashtuni would have ignored the wounded American or would have killed the Taliban scout force when they came to them? How would the mission have gone if the four guys would have known from the get go that they would be completely alone, with no support or hope for extraction?Overall, a very emotional movie, two hours long, that shows more a general type of heroism than one with a specific purpose. Nicely directed and acted. A bit over dramatic, but then that's to be expected. Worth watching.",8,203,351,1 January 2014
Mulan," One of the better Disney cartoons. Same stupid music.
","OK, Disney movie. Nice word play, good emotional story, Eddie Murphy's voice, even Pat Morita is somewhere around there. The same really dumb song and dance routines, though, exactly when the film starts to get interesting. I really really wish they'd stop that.Animation. Disney like. I found it less thorough than many, but still OK. Cannot rival Japanese animation, though.Plot. A bit too shallow for my taste, but after all, this is a cartoon and the audience is children. I am sure battle strategy or good plot continuity were not in the mind of the creators of Mulan.Conclusion: all in all I rate it an 8 for Disney movies, although it's more like 7.5.",8,1,2,4 September 2005
Star Trek," Oh, it was crap. Pure and simple.
","You might say that as an ardent hater of Lost I may be biased, but actually I didn't heed my own advice and I read some reviews about the movie. They were all cautiously favourable so that mellowed down my low expectations of the movie. I mean J.J.Abrams and young ST TOS crew? Come on! But I bought it and I even wen to the cinema to see it. Don't get me started on that!So, where there good parts in it? Of course there were. That's what makes it so annoying. With casting like Zachary Quinto, who secretly I believe could make a very good actor if given half a decent role, Karl Urban, even Eric Bana. I have no idea what Ben Cross and Winona Ryder did in this film, but they also added some value to it. Funny enough, the only player that felt Star Trekish was Bruce Greenwood who I can easily imagine on par with Patrick Stewart in a true Master and Commander meets Star Trek film (which we all know it is what the next movie should be about).Alas, the bad parts overwhelm the good ones. The Star Trek science was always dodgy, especially the one in the original series, but this one was neither true to the series nor close to anything we learn in school about science. I am talking about basic physics here, not something complicated like college! The action scenes were decent, but the style of always moving with the projectile and changing angles in a complete cacophony of loud and improbable sounds made them almost unbearable. The script? It had so many holes in it you just couldn't see any material left. The characters are completely different from the original crew. Almost nothing is left from Gene Roddenberry's legacy.Bottom line: no, it's not as bad as Andromeda, but it's heading there. A film made only for memory deficient teenagers with cultural Attention Deficit Disorder. I could go on and on and on. As I said I really liked the performances of Bruce Greenwood and Eric Bana. You barely recognised the man. But other than that, nothing is worth the destruction of a mythos almost half a century old.",5,32,86,13 May 2009
Train to Busan," Really fun
","I love Korean horror movies. Right when the action and horror is at its peak they insert this home like humor that makes you feel for the characters and understand that while the plot might be ridiculous, so is real life.This is not a comedy, like Gowemul, which I really liked, but has some of these moments that make it fun. The scene when the guy apologetically tells his pregnant wife 'Honey, can you run?' while a horde of zombies approach was priceless.So, yeah, it's a zombie movie. And while it feels fresh, it's nothing you haven't seen before. It's Korean, so it has some specific idiosyncrasies and some of the jokes or social issues it hints at might pass over your head, but it's not that deep.I liked the actors, the kid was really good. The special effects were OK most of the time, but there was one 'explosion of zombies' effect they used twice without it being needed and it looked kind of stupid. I liked the scene where the 'villain' kind of explains how he feels and why he did the horrible and stupid things he did. It is important to care about your characters, including the bad guys and the sacrificial lambs. Americans might want to learn from that.Bottom line: I had a lot of fun watching it. Even my wife was hooked by the end and wanted to watch the ending. Keep fresh horror coming, Korea!",8,12,28,25 December 2016
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino has lost it...
","Tarantino did a few things right: Pulp Fiction, Four Rooms, Natural Born Killers, From Dusk till Dawn. He did it in between '94 and '96. Compared to those films, all his others suck, although, if you compare them with other films, they may be OK or even great. This movie is neither. It's all like a long (very long) bad joke.What's it about? There is this group of American Jews that fight a guerrilla type warfare behind German enemy lines. It's what today would be called terrorism. Is this film about them? No. Are you confused yet? There is this Austrian actor, Christoph Waltz, who plays the role of a German psychopathic officer, speaking English, French and Italian to perfection. He does it well, got an Oscar for it, although I suspect more for the fact that he can speak 5 languages, which is rather astounding to Americans. Is the film about him? Not really. There is an actor playing Hitler. About him? No! Brad Pitt? No.As any Tarantined story there is a lot of talk. Only in this film, it amounts to nothing. The characters are completely impossible to identify yourself with. Actually, the one taking the top for this would be the psychopathic German, so that says a lot about the others. The script makes no sense, mostly, and the little it does, it is completely boring. As for any message the movie would have, I call them racist, any of them, as every nationality is stereotyped to the absurd.Bottom line: one thing the movie got right. No one deserves any glory for the film, including Tarantino. It can be fun, obviously, since so many people liked it, but I hated the time lost on it.",6,3,8,7 February 2010
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A complete disappointment
","I had little hope coming in to see this movie, one might even say that I had a bad feeling about it, but that's a good thing because most of the time when I watch a movie and my expectations are low I get to enjoy the good parts more. Unfortunately, this film has almost no good parts.Now, I am not the type of fan that read the comics and the fan made books and so on, but I did watch all Star Wars movies, with various degrees of enjoyment. I even did a marathon of all the films and I have to say that both originals and prequels felt in the same vein: a bit silly, over the top with 'the vision' of Star Wars, with the technology that looks like in the 1960s if they had a lot more lights on every gadget and star travel, with the black and white battle and the balance of the force. Even the stupid J.J.Abrams version had something to be said about it.Rogue One is clearly worse than any of the films mentioned. Forget the horrible CGI for Tarkin and princess Leia (I've seen better animation in PC games from 2000), forget the scenes that were in the trailer to get you in the cinema and then removed from the theatrical release, forget the scenes where dozens of extras in plastic plated pajamas ran right in the blaster fire and died, forget all of that and instead focus on the characters. The best actor in this movie is, by far, Alan Tudyk. You know who that is? The robot! The young charismatic beautiful female (gender swap! yay!) lead character starts off as nobody, does a few inconsistent flips of behavior, is used as a pawn by just about everyone, and ends as nobody. The father and hero figures are just as unsure of which side they are on and just as uninteresting. The villain is a force-less bureaucrat that somehow ends up in all the scenes, even the action ones, bringing absolutely no charisma or element of intrigue. The Alliance is a joke. The references to the other films just thrown out there randomly, with no consequence whatsoever. I cared for NO character in this film. None! They might just as well been all bad CGI characters with a common backstory of forgotten computer animations that ended up in a movie. I. did. not. care.Bottom line: Donnie Yen's character is a joke, but he is always entertaining when he moves. Alan Tudyk is great as the sarcastic robot. I even liked Riz Ahmed enough to care just a little bit about his character. The rest is utter boredom, waste of time and potential. Rogue One is the first film in the franchise that made me question the reason why I watch these turds. And that's saying a lot.",6,30,58,26 December 2016
Captain Marvel," A decent Marvel film. All that hate was for nothing.
","This is not a masterpiece, mind you, but it's a pretty entertaining flick. Its biggest flaw has to be Brie Larson, but not just because of her, also because of the rather bland reactions scripted into her role. Consider what she goes through and the moment of her big revelation is not any more dramatic than when she was getting angry for Jude Law kicking her ass. Yet even this is minor. One can easily believe that a woman in a man's world, who went through amnesia and two separate army training regimens would be a little bit stiff and guarded.So that leaves the plot and the other actors. I have to say Ben Mendelsohn stole the show. He absolutely owned the film. And that acting next to Jude Law, Samuel L. Jackson and the lead actress. Jackson's role was pretty funny and the terrible scene where he lost his eye was ... absolutely hilarious. Jude Law did his usual good job, but his character was pretty cardboard. All in all, decent story (not marvelous, heh heh heh, but good) and the actors did a good job. Including the cat, who almost stole the show, too! Coulson'n role was too small to mention.I know I am very late to the party, but I didn't watch the film for a long time because of the negativity surrounding it and that disgusting feminist/antifeminist campaign that was related to it. The movie is nothing like that. I liked the Danvers character and Brie Larson was not brilliant, but she wasn't bad at all. I would have watched this film at the cinema and enjoyed it. It's certainly better than any Ant Man crap. So ignore Larson's off screen shenanigans or the people who want to inject their poison into other people's work... just watch the film and enjoy it as it is.",8,7,18,30 May 2019
This Is the End," Even the souls of comedy actors can be redeemed
","I had a lot of fun watching the film, as Hollywood actors face The End of Days. The plot is deliciously simple: a party in L.A. turns sour when the Apocalypse ends the world and a bunch of moderately famous actors, playing themselves, are stuck in a house awaiting a rescue that will never come.If you are amazed of how many well known celebrities are participating in the cast, know that as partying gives way to panic, most of them die in the first quarter of the film, leaving all but six people to play the rest of the film. Petty and fussy weaklings that they are, the Hollywood actors start to lose their civilized patina and show their true color, turning on each other. I especially liked how Seth Rogen - who wrote, produced and starred as one of the lead characters - started as a nice guy, but turned up to be a duplicitous coward.The is the End joins a list of films (mostly written by Canadians so far :) ) which are original, funny and have ingenious scripts. Perhaps the sexual jokes and weird behavior was a bit over board, but then we are talking about people from L.A., so it might even be realistic. I think the scene I liked best was the failed exorcism which almost worked, but for the friends that were afraid the demon would get annoyed.I would have loved more action from Emma Watson, who has grown into a delicious young woman with an equally pleasant British accent, and could have contributed with a bit of that English wit. I liked how the actors were not afraid to play heavily caricatured versions of themselves, just look at Channing Tatum. He had a lot of guts playing the part he did.All in all it was an entertaining comedy, especially if you know the actors involved from other movies. I even found myself laughing out loud at some scenes. You should watch it, I think.",8,4,10,15 October 2013
Iron Man 2," Meh!
","I was never into Iron Man. X-men I liked, Spider-man was OK, but how can I identify with a rich jerk who just happens to be a self absorbed genius? I mean, I'm not rich!Other people must have felt like me, since I've never heard of Iron Man being of the same caliber as most other comic book heroes. After all, he is a technological Superman who didn't have nice parents. But while Superman battled Lex Luthor or some evil villains from his home planet, Iron Man battles moron competitors, the uselessness of the military and some guy with a grudge. It just doesn't work.Mickey Rourke again takes on his old, fat, long haired persona, only now he is also dirty and speaks mainly Russian. When he does speak English he doesn't make much sense. Iron Man does a little Go-Go-Don-Cheadle-Gadget and wins. Samuel L. Jackson appears in a few scenes as the parental figure that knows all, can do all, yet he needs Iron Man for an abstruse reason while Paul Bettany does... the voice of Jarvis.Bottom line: The only thing that doesn't waste one's time is seeing Scarlett Johansson as a hot redhead again, with Gwyneth Paltrow steaming with cat-envy around her. The rest of the film is consistently average, never once creating a moment of true tension or at least great special effects, while it never goes to a moment of bad quality either. So, yeah... meh!",6,1,2,4 November 2010
Alien: Resurrection," Something to love
","This is the kind of movie that is hard to come by: a well written and directed story with elements of horror and sci-fi, a brilliant cast and a European director. It is not for everyone. If you simply want a rehash of any of the previous three films, this is not for you.Resurrection is not a perfect film, there are some scenes - dialogue mainly - which can make one cringe, but overall I found it to be the almost perfect mix of horror, action and irony. With the storytelling talents of Dan O'Bannon and Joss Whedon, you get layer after layer of interesting plot, while Jeunet's directing shows what a movie can be if creativity is let loose.I've seen this film several times now and I am pretty sure I am going to like it every time. It has not aged well, but it wasn't supposed to: its visual design was crafted for this movie only. It is not a Prometheus prequel and it is hardly an Alien sequel. It stands alone and you probably either get to love it or to hate it.",9,1,3,22 March 2017
World War Z," So much better than most zombie films, but still only average.
","There are some things that you get to feel in your bones after watching a lot of movies, one of those feelings that something is wrong at places. I have not read the book the film is based on, but I was having these spider-sense tinglings that some scenes could not have been in the book.Also, the plot reminded me too much of a book I hated with all my heart: The Passage, by Justin Cronin. It starts with character building scenes mingled smartly with action and suspense, than Blam! Reset! A lot of crafty special effects follow that last more than the character building scenes, then there are no characters left. All but the main character get to move to the next stage. Then it starts all over again. It does this at least three times. It gets old and annoying.You have to see this from my perspective: I've watched movies like 28 Hours Later, where complex characters and spooky music create a truly horrorful atmosphere. I've seen things like Night of the Living Dead, filled with social commentary that made the film interesting beside the moving corpses. I have seen films that use plot devices like crammed spaces to build up what they can't possibly build with their allotted budget. The problem with World War Z is that is it perfectly made, tons of special effects, many locations, scary running zombies (in hordes!), but the story is the same lame 'lone hero does all the work and saves the day'. In 3D, no less!This can be felt painfully in the last scenes, when really well known and good British and German and Italian actors play secondary roles that anyone could have played. It was like a weird twist on the Statue of Liberty text: give us your best and we'll give them mediocre roles, because we have the budget.Bottom line: so much better than most zombie films, but still only average. I know it seems contradictory, but that's how I feel about it. I will read the book only to see if I was right feeling that all those extra scenes were off somehow.",7,6,16,25 June 2013
Passengers," Entertaining, but not very deep
","Once you've seen the trailer, you pretty much have seen the movie. The rest is individual acting from Pratt and Lawrence and some special effects. I liked both. Unfortunately, that's as deep as it goes. It's pretty obvious that some exec greenlit an elevator pitch like 'Moon, but with two hot and famous people that have a fling'. I was expecting some sort of twist at the end, but there wasn't any.Bottom line: straight forward movie, touching lightly on some moral and emotional issues, but failing to take it any further. My wife thought it was boring. I kind of liked it, but frankly I liked Michael Sheen the most out of the entire film.",7,2,4,5 March 2017
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Hey! Thumbs up for a good romantic comedy for a change!
","You know how movies about breakups tend to fall immediately into a pattern, becoming uninteresting and purely financial? Breakups usually follow a pattern, so isn't that normal? No, it is not, because human relationships are personal and a movie about them should reflect first and foremost that personal thing, the thing that makes it seem so different from anybody else's experience.This movie does that, and does it well. There are still some exaggerations, mainly for comic relief, but overall it is a good romantic comedy. It made me laugh, which is more than I can say for 95% of all comedies I've ever watched.Bottom line: A must see with a girl you want a relationship with. Oh, and Mila Kunis is really really cute! They went over the top there to make here lovable... and I am hooked! :)",8,4,10,3 November 2008
The Hunger Games," NOT a teenage movie at all
","One might immediately assume that because the movie is about adolescents, it has action sequences and a well known cast then it is a big budget block buster movie that has good production value, but zero story. It is not so.The Hunger Games is the first book in a trilogy (I know, they are either a trilogy or a saga nowadays) and the subject is nothing if not socially and politically deep. You see, in a fictive country named Panem, there is a Capitol, something very reminiscent of Rome in a technological Roman empire and 12 districts that are ruled with an iron fist. Each year each district provides a boy and a girl, randomly chosen, as tribute in order to fight to the death for the pleasure of the people in the Capitol.Now, the clich√©s that you would have expected at this point make their absence obvious. The main character is a girl, the games do not result in the destruction of evil and the win of good, nor does every character act like a piece of cardboard.Without revealing more, I urge you to watch this. The main actors play well, the story is interesting, the effects are nice, but not extraneous to the plot, while the overall feeling is of observing great injustice and being almost powerless against it.",9,3,12,1 April 2012
Zootopia," Buddy cop movie, with 3D animated cute err... animals
","The movie was amusing and I watched it till the end. The problem with it is not really the film itself as it is with its genre: let's take a story that would be slightly ridiculous if we did it with real people, because it would feel lazy and hard to suspend belief, and make it 3D with cute animals, because this way one can get away with anything. And then market it to both adults and children, because it's a cartoon, but has some adult salt and pepper here and there.In short, it's a recipe movie. The animation is good, the voices are good - I mean, just look at the cast - with an appropriate huge budget. It even has heart, but painted there with such a heavy hand that I felt someone stuck down my throat a cute fluffy animal. Nothing above the ordinary yet, although I believe the standard is going to drop dramatically with each summer animated Hollywood film.",7,1,4,20 June 2016
The Impossible," A family in the midst of dramatic events
","This is a good film, with good direction and acting. Even the script, the usual weakness of American movies is quite good. Not everything that is said is a plot device and most of the stuff that is shown in the film is based on actual facts.The problem that I had with the film was the way the tsunami was really something in the background, as were the actions of other people. There was so much focus on what do and feel the five members of the family that anything else felt blurry. It has to do with my own expectations, which were to gain insight in the disaster itself, rather than the emotional hardships of a single family caught in it.The action scenes were spectacular, I grant you that. To see in detail what happens to a human body caught in a massive wave filled with debris is shocking. The emotional scenes were OK, mostly. The soundtrack was appropriate, but it annoyed me to no end. Really, I can feel for myself, chill with the violins already!Bottom line: There are some gruesome scenes in the film, but it is mostly character acting and dialogue. The focus is only on one five member family and, after quite an emotional journey, the movie ends. It is a good movie, something that I would recommend, but I didn't feel it was out of the ordinary.",8,3,4,20 January 2013
Shaun of the Dead," Funny comedy, but a bit disappointing in the end
","The comedy starts very well, with the team that later would do Hot Fuzz, putting out a lot of funny ideas. I especially liked the view of early morning people that look and act like zombies anyway. Then I loved the way it all gradually translated into the zombie thing.But then it all fell apart. Bill Nighy had the smallest of roles when he could have added a lot of humour there. The puns and jokes just went silent while they were either bashing zombies or running away from them.Just as Hot Fuzz, it started really well and then stalled, like an airplane going straight up.Bottom line: funny zombie movie, definitely worth watching, but a bit disappointing.",7,3,8,28 July 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," The three part saga thing is starting to annoy me
","It started a long time ago (in a galaxy not so far far away) when films started to mix with TV series and transform into sagas. Even the name annoys the hell out of me. If it's on TV, it's a mini series, if it's on the big screen it's a saga!Unfortunately, the same thing happened to Pirates of the Caribbean. The second part is less funny and intriguing, has a lot of special effects, and the characters transform dramatically in order to make the link to the third part. Of course, just reediting the first part wouldn't have been good either. I guess what really bothered me is that this film cannot be taken separately from the first and (apparently) from the third. It's just the middle of something bigger and you can't truly enjoy it for itself. They went the Matrix way: the first film nice and interesting, then a two part second part which they name 2 and 3, just for kicks and which you can't really separate from each other.But it was also a good film. Johhny Depp does wonders once again, even if he lost that charming wavy way of standing. The evil spooks are not even more spooky and the human and mollusk look payed off. It look great. Keira Knightley... I really made efforts to like her. She even seemed sexy when she first rose to stardom, but for whatever reason I just can't stand the woman now. Orlando Bloom is co-starring. I can't put it any other way, he is there just for filling up space. He could have had a better and more complex role. I loved Bill Nighy in the role of Davy Jones, captain of the mollusk pirates.I just have to say something about Naomie Harris. She is HOT! The cute Jamaican accent thing and the fine, yet complex movements of lips make her look terribly sexy. She plays a minor role, yet she does it in style.Bottom line: it's a nice continuation. Could have been better and it's more than a sequel. But since it is a fun movie to begin with, you will probably have fun either way.",7,2,4,24 July 2006
Argo," Typical US politico, nothing special
","You have seen this film before, only it was called differently and was about something else. The tricks are all there, the artificial tension moments, the eye tearing speeches and scenes, the brave people, the evil henchmen, etc.Ben Affleck received an award for this film, but I can't really see any reason why other than Americans really liking their own stories and rewarding people for telling them. The acting was OK, but nothing spectacular. Actually, there was no role in the film that felt particularly demanding. The 'dramatization' of the story was so clich√© that I felt like barfing and it all took two hours. Worst of all, all the good scenes were in the trailer already.Bottom line: this is an average film, made with leftovers from different TV shows and running on a recipe for this kind of movies. That isn't all bad, since we have enjoyed some of its kind before, but for an avid movie goer like myself, I've seen too many clones of the same thing and this brought nothing new. Luckily there is always at least one generation that falls for the cheap TV movie tricks that they employed here.",7,3,5,15 January 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," A lot better than I expected
","I really thought it was going to be a shallow macho story with lots of action and no depth. And, in many a respect, it was so. But I didn't hate it. I had fun all the way, liked the characters, liked the casting and Benedict Cumberbatch made a fantastic Khan. The 3D wasn't really impressive and I guess, seen in old fashioned 2D, it would not have lost any of the watching pleasure.If I have to dislike something it is the exaggerated action scenes and the obvious humour. In a world of high technology and science, there is a lot of hand to hand combat, punching and then some silly jokes to lighten the mood. However, that is consistent to the original Star Trek series, so I can't complain too much. I really would have liked Scotty to be a little more serious. Even if Simon Pegg is a comedy actor, I am sure he can do something more than comic relief in an action movie.My conclusion: amazingly fun, but then I went there with low expectations to begin with. I am a bit preoccupied that they are moving away from the ideas of The Next Generation to wallow in the more base concepts of The Original Series, but overall I liked the movie.",9,3,7,19 May 2013
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," I expected a childish story from C.S.Lewis
","OK, I didn't read the book and I didn't see the 1988 TV adaptation. Shame on me! However, I did watch this film and I was averagely impressed by it.First of all, the special effects. There are not so many, but they are subtle. The movie has a lot of animals and they all look like animals (for the first time ever) and there are some clever computer light manipulation and actor physiognomy mapping to make it seem natural.The story. It is a children's tale. Don't expect much from it. It doesn't explain things and it has a lot of 'lucky strikes' typical of a story that is not meant to scare or excite, but to make a point. It has children that fate has put in a very important position and they are more or less forced to act it out, learning a lot about themselves, family and building character. It has a lot of inconsistencies and it fails to keep you into the tale. I found myself shouting 'Use the bloody bottle! Shoot the damn bow already!', though, so I guess it all depends on how far you are willing to go.The actors. Tilda Swinton again plays a powerful creature with mental issues. She does it well. Actually, the movie would have been bad without her. It does make sense in a movie with four or more main positive characters and only one villain. The children... are OK. The big sister is terribly annoying, but maybe that's just me. The others in the cast are either animals (like the beavers from the Milka commercials :) ) or have secondary parts.The conclusion: a book intended to be a Christian allegory for little children is transformed into a movie. The audience is little Christian children. There isn't much else to be said. Maybe even old Arabs will enjoy it as long as they understand it is a simple tale with lots of inspirational music.",7,0,0,5 January 2006
Green Room," Filled with tension to the end
","I liked the movie. I didn't feel the awe that so many of the reviewers reported, but the direction was spot on and the acting, too. One of my few complaints is that the film was too dark, in the way that it was hard to see what was going on. It was realistically dark, but a bit annoying. The second is that it was a bit slow; perhaps I was spoiled by non stop action flicks there, though.The plot revolves around this hard punk rock band that has a gig in a skinhead joint and they witness a murder. Trying to cover it up (and their heroin operation and whatever they were doing down there) the owner is attempting not only to murder the young people, but also to stage it in a believable way for the police.It was interesting in the sense that it felt very real. The situations, ironically, felt weird because no one was good at what they were trying to do. These were hard neonazi backwater hillbillies, but they weren't proficient at killing, they were afraid, they made mistakes. The members of the band were trying to survive, but didn't take the logical solution or even the hysterical 'let me out of here!' clich√© that is so overused in thrillers, but had more human reactions that endeared them to the viewer.The scene in the end describes Saulnier's vision to the dot: 'This is a nightmare', says a member of the band, 'For us all', replies the leader of the bad guys. The ending is neither happy, nor hopeless, just ugly, dirty, leaving you with the same feeling the characters in the film, including the dog, had 'why did this had to happen at all?'.",8,1,4,28 May 2017
The Other Boleyn Girl," Historical drama that was a bit shocking
","I am having difficulties rating a movie of this genre. The acting was very good, the story complex (even if inspired from history), the portrayal of the time's way of things was both well rendered and disgusting. The subject was not so interesting to me, so I am trying to ignore my slight boredom to try to maintain some sort of objectivity.About the movie, imagine women (and young men) planned, traded, manipulated and used as a mere commodity, nothing more than cattle, for the reasons of gaining favor upon their families. Marriages were ignored or broken at the whim of kings or higher noblemen, daughters were forced to accept whoredom and everybody had a plan.In the middle of things, the Boleyn sisters, played by Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson. Handled between their greedy family and a petulant and immature king, they become part of history without, I would wager, having much to do with any of the things that happened to them. People have deplored the lack of historical accuracy of the script, but I wouldn't know about that. In the film Anne is shown as manipulating the king by refusing to bed him and the king, maddened with passion, does everything she asks. I wonder if that could ever have been possible.Bottom line: if you are a history buff, you should watch it. Women might also get a kick out of marriages and babies and miscarriages and drama. It is a well done movie and, subject aside, a very decent film.",9,0,1,21 June 2009
The Girl Next Door," Adolescent fantasy coming true. Nicer than what I expected.
","Have a look at this funny teenager movie. It's about a geekish boy meeting a porn star, having her fall in love with him, then ending up together. The plot was unusually thick for this kind of movies and not too clich√©.Timothy Oliphant (who I think shows a lot of promise as an actor) stars in this one in a secondary role. Beautiful Elisha Cuthbert is playing the porn star. James Remar also has a part.I have to say that overall the movie was too fantastic to be believable, but then again, it is about adolescent fantasies and 'power to the geek' things, so it wasn't supposed to feel real. I do hate when they put good lookers in the role of losers and they tag them as losers with weird glasses, thick shirts or pull-overs. I mean, all you have to do to be popular is loose the glasses, clothes and half a brain. Yeah, right! No wonder so many American teens are screwed up.Conclusion: cute love story, nice movie for its category, must see with girlfriend.",7,0,0,13 August 2005
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Remarkably good
","We are talking about a Disney movie made after a 2D platform running video game that I used to play when I was a kid and starring Jake Gyllenhaal, so I started up with very low expectations. I did expect, though, great special effects and the usual wall spikes and some ridiculous story.Well, I am glad to say that there were no wall spikes, the story actually made sense and the actor play redeemed any kitschy background music or the silly 'wise' text appearing at the start and end of the movie. The effects were not so prevalent, instead the focus being on the acrobatics of the main character, a true free-running extravaganza.So, my bottom line is that is one of those easy to watch movies which you can have fun following, but a lot better than the vast majority of the movies in this category. It is a bit too soft, but then again, it is a Disney movie. All actors played well and they were clearly happy doing the movie, which is rare for such block buster franchises. The acting and physical performance took precedence over special effects. I liked that.",8,0,1,31 October 2010
Ted," Funny comedy that doesn't feel like has people laughing in the background
","I do not watch Family Guy, so I don't know what the maker of this film did before and I don't really care, either. This film, taken stand alone, was pretty entertaining. Now, that doesn't mean it was great, but for a Hollywood comedy to not suck is already way above average.Besides, look at that amazing cast doing this film just because it was fun to do so: Mark Wahlberg (I love him), Mila Kunis (who doesn't love her?), Giovanni Ribisi (playing a really creepy guy), Patrick Warburton (who is always funny), Norah Jones, Sam J. Jones (Flash Gordon himself!), Tom Skerritt. And the narrator is Patrick Stewart!The plot is rather silly and basic, but the script is good, with a lot of funny jokes and a light and careless feel. I enjoyed this film, and I was pretty sure I wouldn't. Glad I was wrong.",8,0,3,9 January 2013
The Secret in Their Eyes," An example for movie makers everywhere
","It took me three years to finally watch this movie. It was in Spanish, and it was always easier to watch a silly blockbuster or some series when coming back from work, so I always waited it out. I am glad I did not wait any longer. As other reviewers noticed, it is hard to find flaws in the movie, from the beautiful story, nice camera work and great acting to the painfully emotional feel and the depiction of Argentinian corrupt justice system.The film is slow paced, but building strength with every scene. The characters are complex, the situation is complicated and real. There are no useless plot devices, gratuitous violence or nudity, no ridiculously moral or powerful or lucky or beautiful people. No pointless Spanish cursing and over-dramatic scenes. It's painfully real for its whole length and, even if the ending is pretty intense, you get there in a smooth curve.Bottom line: if this is the film, I really wonder how good the book was. The movie was perfect for me and I can't recommend enough watching it. It deals with love, pain, obsession, helplessness and retribution is a way few films ever succeed or even dare.",10,8,9,6 May 2013
Hot Fuzz," Point Blank meets The Midsommer Murders via Bad Boys 2
","Very nice English comedy, makes fun of action movies and murder mysteries alike without being a nonsensical film. I mean, it is a parody, but it is also a stand alone story. The humour is great and the overall quality good.There are people that graded this very high, unfortunately I've read their reviews and brought very high expectations to it. So just accept it's a good movie, a relaxing and funny comedy and you'll appreciate it. It doesn't take itself too seriously, so neither should you.And there isn't much else to say about it or the minimum 10 lines of text for IMDb comments :)",8,4,6,1 May 2007
Constantine," Stigma meets Matrix
","I happen to like Keanu Reaves and I think he would do great in great roles. Unfortunately for him, he didn't get any lately. This movie is fun to watch, with nice special effects, but rather than that it is just another catholic-through-American-eyes movie with a lot of ass kicking.If you want to watch a movie when you have got a lot of spare time on your hands, do watch this one. Keanu plays the good-bad guy and Rachel Weiss plays the usual bimbo in distress but wanted by demons and angels alike. And by Keanu, since the movie ends in a typical (bleah!) Hollywood 'you were a pain in the ass the whole movie, let's hook up' scene. I do hope this isn't considered a spoiler...Anyway, feel free to discard any negative comments on this movie from my part, since I am an atheist born in an orthodox country and I have no comic book experience. Perhaps this is a cult movie or something.",8,1,7,6 March 2005
About Time," The title says it all, but it's about happiness and love, too
","It is very difficult not to like a starring Bill Nighy, even the crappy ones get an extra star at least just for featuring him, but About Time is also written by Richard Curtis, of Love Actually fame, so there is only a tiny tiny chance the movie would not be good. And then Rachel McAdams plays in it, too, making it an instant hit. So like other reviewers here, I don't understand people implying they didn't like the movie (I've just scientifically demonstrated that is impossible).Time travel films are usually about two things: alternate history and second chances. Alternate history is just a plot device for telling a science fiction story in a familiar environment, while second chances films almost always talk about fixing past mistakes, avoiding regret, enjoying life. This makes About Time more amazing, because it is actually almost devoid of the quasi-religious platitudes relating to regret, guilt and consequences. It is about enjoying life, it is about enjoying your friends and your family, if you are lucky enough to have enjoyable ones, like the dude in the film. It is about enjoying Rachel McAdams, too, but that shouldn't be too difficult.Bottom line: a bit long at two hours and also having little to do with exploring the awesome power of time travel. However it is a very pleasant romance and family movie, with good solid humour, but without trying to be a comedy, and it is not one of those horrid Christmas ghost things, either. Luckily for us, the lead character was a very nice guy, as was his father, and he didn't consider living his life, then taking it from the start all over again, with other people, other children, other hours of watching... I recommend it.",9,2,2,16 May 2014
Spotlight," Something was not quite right
","The story is fantastic and the people that were involved in it needed to be recognized or revealed, depending on which side they were on, but something was a bit off about the movie. The performances were great as well, so the only thing that remains is the direction.It was a good movie, don't get me wrong, but it felt bland most of the time, yet peppered with some mildly irritating moments that pumped the dramatic. You know, children appearing in the shot randomly and long shots on the frowns of the reporters, heroic overtime working and watching the morning edition leaving in the trucks in the night and so on and so on. One other thing that bothered me was that John Slattery was cast in the role of a red herring, but otherwise minor. I like the guy, he deserves good meaty roles!Bottom line: I liked The Big Short a lot more. I can't tell you exactly why, since both movies are using the same kind of recipe: ordinary people investigating something unbelievable, but true, the old 'get an Oscar' formula, yet I liked only one of them. It was the mood, perhaps, or the dynamism. Anyway, I think there are so many other movies that deserved an Oscar more than this one.",8,0,1,3 March 2016
Terminator Salvation," This was actually a decent film!
","Enough with the copycat comments! Everybody is so keen to criticize this film, while completely ignoring its good parts. Was there some plot weirdness? Well, yeah, we are talking humans winning versus machines here. But most of it was decent.In this film you get to see more machine types, more character ambivalence (do you even remember the first Terminator? it was machine fascism!), more hints to the previous movies and, most of all, hints of the direction of the Terminator concept. I don't want to spoil it for you, but you must be blind not to see it is a good thing.Other good things in this movie: Moon Bloodgood, the Oh-girl; Michael Ironside, just as fun as ever, even if having some scenes. And there is Sam Worthington, who is actually the main character and more like Help from BSG, but twice as cool, NOT Christian Bale aka John Connor.I am surprised to see that both Terminator the series and the new Terminator are bringing some modernism to the old age concept of machine war. They are obviously not without flaw, but considering the alternatives and, even more, my expectations, I would say that saying this film was bad must be just some fashionable thing to say right now.Bottom line: I liked it!",7,141,240,17 July 2009
Aquaman," I thought Disney bought Marvel, not DC
","There is no reason that I know for why Aquaman turned into the modern CGI version of The Little Mermaid, liberally mixed with Aladdin and The Lion King. I mean, yeah, Black Panther was mostly Lion King, but it was interesting and fun and the world building was not bad. Aquaman feels cartoonish from the start to the very end. The pointless CGI, Heard's horrible wig, all the fairy tale characters that seek to show us how they are superior to people on the surface who have grown up reading about single dimensional characters like them, the predictability that one can find in children stories only. To be honest, the feeling I have most about this film is outrage. It is condescending and dumb. It's the Hollywood version of Homer telling Bart he's stupid.And then there is the cast. Jason Momoa, who I liked in Atlantis, the Stargate one, because he was supposed to have only one dimension. Amber Heard, who hasn't had a good role in ages and sporting that eye soar of a bad wig, Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe getting their paychecks. And Dolph Ludgren? WTF? The main character of this story was Patrick Wilson's, he had the most relevant scenes, he was the only one who actually looked like he gave a damn about his performance. He is the true king of the film!Bottom line, it was so dumb it was offensive.",5,2,4,6 March 2019
My Neighbor Totoro," Cute anime. Childhood/sisterhood/nature spirits
","I think this is a movie made especially for children. It doesn't have a lot of tension or conflict, nor does it have dangers of any kind, feelings of doom or people dying as many of the Japanese productions used us with. Long story short, two girls and their father await for the mother to come out of the hospital. Meanwhile wonderful things happen, like the friendship with a huge teddy bear like creature which seems to be a forest spirit.Saying that, I am 28 years old and I liked it a lot :), even if not so much as other Myiazaki cartoons, so it's not only for kids. It did seem a bit long for me at times, but after its 90 minutes length I felt bad that it ended so soon. If you get over the first 30 minutes, which are a bit slow paced, you will probably enjoy this animation film.",7,2,5,11 September 2005
500 Days of Summer," A romance for guys
","And by that I mean that the movie exposes romantic feelings through the perspective of a guy. He finds this girl, Summer, hence the title of the movie, falls for her, and has 500 days of ups and downs because of her.The movie starts a little off, with a narrator explaining what is what and a silly counter going back and forth over the 500 days, but it slowly grows on you, with the little bits of graphical re-rendering of some scenes and the good soundtrack and the feelings portrayed as they usually are, raw and strange, not something ridiculous and standard like most crappy romantic comedies these days.What I find strange is that I had a very similar experience in my life, yet I could feel no kinship with the guy. Something was off, yet I don't know what. Maybe the feelings were slightly altered so that they fit into more of a comedic atmosphere, or maybe it was his face, or maybe it's just that it was actually a completely different story than mine.Bottom line: it's funny, it's real, the wife loved it and I found it nice enough to watch and thoroughly enjoy. The moral of the story: girls with big light blue eyes are trouble... ;)",9,0,1,8 November 2009
Juno," Definitely original, Canadian feeling film
","My wife liked it a lot, maybe because it concerns pregnancies and having babies and stuff. I like it because it showed people actually behaving like human beings, making fun of their own predicament, being able to put logic in front of instinctual feelings and all that.It is hard to describe the film. It felt Canadian, in other words without ridiculous clich√©s and everyone being in constant competition for money, attention, coolness or anything like that. It had a plot, too. And I didn't feel I watched a comedy. I mean, yeah, the characters are funny sometimes, but that's just like talking to a friend that says something pleasant, and you smile because you feel good, not because you consider your friends part of your entertainment.That's about it. If you liked Donnie Darko or Hatley High, this felt like a combination of the two. Without the psychotic bunny, I mean. It was a good movie and I am glad it took several awards this year, but I don't think it was too great either. Could have helped if I didn't dislike Hard Candy so much.",8,3,7,30 March 2008
Don Jon," A porn addict advisory film
","I want to start off by saying this film was a failure, from my standpoint, and as such I would have rated it below average. But then I realized how the trailer for the movie was specifically crafted to make you think this is another genre entirely, so I had to punish the grade further. It really gets on my nerves when someone cheats me by letting me think I am getting something else and then giving me anything else.The plot, to make it clear, is that of a lower class guy who is addicted to porn. He meets a girl that he seems to be in love with, one that is the opposite of him, apparently: classy, beautiful, wants him to go to school, get a better job, watch romantic movies, etc. They split up over the porn business and he meets Julianne Moore, who is clearly not scared of nudity, porn or any sexual behaviour, and that cures him of his inability to relate to women.That is the whole plot. It is a philosophical story, one that could have been better made, one that is worth telling, just not by tricking people to come see your movie thinking it's a romantic flick, as the trailer implied. It is NOT a romantic movie. Instead it is one that shows the first girl, Scarlet's character, is just as alienated as the main character, only in a completely different direction, that of the fake romance and perfect life plan. A film that shows that people are never perfect and illusions are fine unless they stop you from living your life (and even then, I would argue, but I am talking about the film).Bottom line: I am sure there could be a better version of this story. As such, it almost feels like an anecdote that one says to a party or one of those awful education advisories children are forced to watch in school. The actors played well, but they just didn't have a good script to work with. One 'gets it' and the ending is even slightly philosophical, but the presentation is all off.",5,1,6,3 January 2014
Deadpool 2," The slow death of R
","Deadpool 2 is fun. Ryan Reynolds is fun. There are jokes aplenty. There is a lot of nice CGI, too. What the movie lacked was a story. I mean, stuff happens, but not for any particular reason other than comic relief. Yet you have to have something to be relieved from, first. And it's not like the ideas didn't have potential: a hero losing his will to live, a bunch of other superheros from which Domino has the superpower of luck, the origin story of a hero or a supervillain, depending on the choices of the characters in the movie, time travel, Cable, Juggernaut... Yukio? Anyway, none of these ideas get developed after a quick exposition. Domino is pretty cool, but her superpower is just ... too super. Cable was cool, but as a character he is pretty much, just like Juggernaut, another version of the straight face man, just another Colossus.And yes, Brad Pitt is the Vanisher and Matt Damon is a redneck and there are probably other cameos of note, and yes, there are a lot of sex jokes and foul mouthed dialogue, but the violence is now more subdued, with less blood, less gore, less pain, less impact. There is no substitute for the sex scene with Morena Baccarin from the first movie and the only nudity that counts is probably Jugernaut's ass. So while the movie starts with swearing at Wolverine for doing a hard R Logan, the rest of the film is mild. Rather than a competition for Logan, Deadpool 2 is more a counterpart for Tucker and Dale vs Evil.Bottom line: mindless fun. I kind of liked the first one better because there was a better story and way better characterization.",7,0,1,9 August 2018
Spider-Man 3," The only good thing about this movie was Bruce Campbell
","I expected something silly, with a quality even lower then Spiderman 2, but it was worse. Tobey has nothing to do with Spiderman and the only thing that made this watchable was the comics and cartoons on the subject that made Spiderman more of an icon than a character. Thus armed I could ignore Tobey altogether and just focus on the story...The story is not completely stupid, but compared even with the plots in the cartoons, it just lacks. The moralizing aunt and the nice Russian landlord don't help either. A nice landlord... in New York. Now alien lifeforms that clone spidermen and people demoleculized that can control sand I can believe!Bottom line: the effects are cool, but the suspension of disbelief does not happen. It's all bigger and dumber. At least the red head looked less stoned this time.",6,2,2,28 July 2007
Thor: Ragnarok," Better and worse than I expected
","The thing to remember when watching this movie is that it will never make any sense. Repeat it as a mantra until you believe it and you will enjoy it thoroughly. Half of it happens on a garbage planet that had no connection with the Marvel Universe, the second in the feudal surroundings of Asgaard, the crown of the known Universe. Wait, what? Hey, take me back to the garbage planet, man! So the story is not really relevant, I mean you know it from the trailer: bad Hela comes, bad Hela goes. I really hoped they would reach some sort of new dynamic of the brothers, now that they have a sister, but they go the standard direction of the psychotic overpowered and ultimately dumb villain. So what remains are the characters. And the thing is that the movie is entertaining. From the action scenes, the slapstick humor, the ridiculous cameos and the completely over the top... everything, the movie is fun. So fun, in fact, that it feels like a parody.What I think happened is that some execs wanted to turn Thor into a Guardians of the Galaxy kind of thing. It was funny, it was ridiculous, but people liked it. What they didn't understand is that there are a lot more movies that are both funny and ridiculous and no one gives them the time of day. So I was both entertained and completely disappointed in the movie. After all, it is a Thor movie, I shouldn't have had high expectations, and I always knew that the best scenes were in the trailer anyway, but when they take a whole legendary planet and portray it as one of those Stargate SG-1 places where everybody wears rags and lives in a single village, I can't help but cringe.Bottom line: Kids will probably love it. It's a good movie to watch drunk or high. Other than that, it's mediocre.",7,1,2,23 January 2018
Resident Evil: Extinction," Resident Evil: Mad Max
","Time and again the recipe American movie revolves around guns, gasoline and military like organisms. It is getting more ridiculous still when the action takes place in a post-apocalyptic desert. They don't have food, water or any future, but they always have plenty of gas and bullets.This part of the series takes bad writing to extinction. Alice has psychic powers and she uses them about three times in the whole movie, four if you count sleepwalking (sleeppsyching? :) ) with only one significant result. Everybody else dies, either stupidly, heroically or semantically (they leave for Alaska which is remote, but still in the States. There is no reason to destroy the world if you can't be patriotic :). Also, the good psychotic doctor also becomes some mutated monster, then dies.Also, being a front girl for a cosmetic company has its downfalls as well: poor Milla looks like she has smooth plastic skin.Bottom line: the first movie was fun, based on the game; the second was a bit stretched, but still entertaining enough; the third is a waste of time.",6,0,1,20 October 2007
The Prestige," Great movie, a bit tense
","As Hollywood made a habit of, we were presented with two magician movies in the same year. I really enjoyed The Illusionist, which was a very well done movie and in which the level of tension was high, but not enough to distraught my wife. But The Prestige goes over the edge. It presents the bitter rivalry between two magicians (and I mean BITTER). They hurt and humiliate each other and finally resort to murder. The wife couldn't handle it all, she said she can't bear to watch so much evil and childishness. Of course, she would have gobbled everything if it involved two women fighting for a man or any such nonsense :)It is a movie about obsession. And sacrifice. Boys and their toys, gone really bad. The atmosphere is made even more weird by David Bowie, coming to enact Tesla, the scientist who is now regarded as a modern day wizard, and by Michael Caine, who plays the 'Engineur' in other words, the tech guy.Great movie, you should really try to watch it. Christian Bale gives a fantastic performance. Hugh Jackman was not so bad either.",8,1,2,15 April 2007
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," God awful piece of commercial .... !
","If you mix a little of Warcraft 3 with The Mummy 3 you get HellBoy 2. Does that make sense?An evil elf of royal blood wants to break the ancient truce that held humans and the other creatures at peace. What other creatures, you ask? Why, the forest Gods, the creatures living under bridges and suspiciously similar to Star Wars aliens, trolls, elves, tooth fairies and goblins!Now this is a true revelation for me, the perfect recipe for peace: leave everything to the enemy, while you hide in some magic sewer.The story is ridiculous, the characters completely not sympathetic and the Peter Parker anguish just doesn't sit well with a red angry demon.Bottom line: it's not even good for laughs. It's an average modern day no brain neo-fantasy film. Yuckie!",6,3,5,27 September 2008
Cloverfield," Refreshing immersive view in a Godzilla clone
","The movie was definitely well thought and done. I give it high marks because of the actual thinking that was involved in creating the concept of the movie. After all, anything else in a film is secondary to the main concept. The actors played well, the music score was suitable and the special effects great.However, something was missing from it. Or something was extra. I couldn't relate to any of the characters. Whenever I got closer to their state of mind that annoying guy would start shouting 'Oh, my god' again and again and that spoiled it immensely. What can I say, maybe Americans or at least New Yorkers would feel differently watching the film. The greatest problem, I think, was that they first 20 minutes were completely useless. If you watch the movie from minute 17, actually, you are not missing anything relevant.Bottom line: it is a great tension movie. A bit of horror, a little monster here and there, lots of 'out of control' fear... I think it worth watching and definitely one of the best horror movies around.",8,0,0,26 June 2008

Lots of metal+unskinned flesh monsters, visceral emotions linked with females and their mother-child connections, insane cult worshipers, this film has it all.The plot is a little confusing, though, and it is all because the story would have been really simple if at all logical. The atmosphere is good, with creepy bloody networks growing all over the place after a strange siren call and a constant ashy rain. The idea of a ghost town sitting on top of perpetually burning coal mines is not bad either.All and all, I think it is a movie that was intended to both audiences, male and female. Alas, women will not watch it because they don't get married in the end and men won't get it because it's all about mothers trying to find their daughters.Besides, once you see Alice Krige having a part in the movie, you know where evil is at :) In conclusion, I think it's a fun flick for horror fans. Could have been more gory and less 'devily' and with a little less female screams, but all and all it's OK.",7,2,4,25 June 2006
Ready Player One," Does justice to the book
","The book is a love letter to the 1980s, filled with references and puns and that nostalgia for the time when 'it was all a game'. It would have been very difficult to capture it all in a movie, but this film managed to get the gist of it. If there was anything that I didn't quite like was the chemistry between Tye Sheridan and Olivia Cooke, which wasn't. Oh, and the ending... Tuesdays and Thursdays... right.Imagine a world where anything is possible and an epic quest for the keys to the kingdom. Complete it, and you will be the king. Lose and the villain will get to have it all and corrupt it after their own corporate image. A true hero's journey to find friendship, love and everything else. The perfect combination of 80's nostalgia and young adult movie. And directed by Spielberg, probably the only person who could convince all the rights holders to borrow their characters for this film that shows (briefly) King Kong, Jurassic Park, Mechagodzilla, The Iron Giant, Prince Goro, Alien, the Back to the Future DeLorean, Chucky, The Shining, Halo and so many others.Bottom line: it's not nearly as good as the book, but it does it justice.",8,4,8,18 June 2018
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Good attempt, but the mini-series is better
","I have delayed seeing this movie until I had the time and disposition to watch the BBC mini series from 1979. Having seen both, I can now compare them. The series was a lot better. It showed the connections between the characters, the things that made the betrayals, the infighting and the revenges so important and so personal. The film doesn't quite make it so.And look at the great cast. I do feel it was underused. Ciar√°n Hinds and even Colin Firth shown only in a few scenes, John Hurt has a similar fate. Then there is the story. It follows pretty much the one in the series, but with a lot of the details removed. I agree it is the only way to cram more than five hours into a two hour film, but the choice of the things they left out bothered me.Bottom line: even having seen the miniseries, I couldn't grasp some of the details from the movie. The cerebral way in which the series was made turned into a glacial and impersonal view of the story in the film. I can't imagine I would have understood the feelings of any of the characters just by watching the movie. Also many of the important bits in the series were completely skipped here, like the power struggle in the Circus or the personal connection between Jim Prideaux and Bill Haydon or even the continued humiliation of George Smiley on account of his wife's indiscretions. Even if lower budget and a lot slower paced, I would still recommend the series.",7,3,5,9 August 2013
The Hateful Eight," Better directed than written, but still a Tarantino classic
","The movie is a whooping two hours and forty five minutes and, to put it mildly, it's not fast paced. That being said, the shots are grand, the acting very good and the story weird enough to make it a classic. I mean, what could possibly go wrong, with Tarantino directing and writing a movie about Kurt Russel stuck in a frozen unforgiving place with a bunch of people, some not being what the seem they are?Inappropriate The Thing references aside, the only issue with this film is that it is slow and it doesn't really have a resolution or character evolution or, one might say, a point. He made this story solely about the characters and that might make the viewer feel a bit bored and certainly a bit confused about some tactical decisions characters make (sometimes it seems that they do things just in order to let themselves speak later).Not Tarantino's best, but a good movie nonetheless. I feel that he outshone himself in directing the film, but the story could have been better.",8,5,29,1 January 2016
Dear John," White Trash Great Expectations
","This was not really a very engaging film, but it was rather truthful and well played. I also had a problem with the ridiculously clich√©d soundtrack, but the script was OK, the people did good work and Richard Jenkins, of course, carried a large part of the film, even in a rather non essential role.The thing is that the story was almost like that in Great Expectations, but with less drama, less obstacles, and less education. The same game of cat and mouse between the two lovers, but without there being any real reason for it. And while Great Expectations was focused on the game, Dear John had the idea as a mere afterthought.That being said, it can be nice to watch. Not to me though.",7,0,1,5 June 2010
The Adventures of Tintin," Really ridiculous story, but consistent with the original comics and really well done
","This is by no means a masterpiece and, by storyline, one might think it is pretty silly. But if you remember the comics (I know, drawn almost a century ago, pretty hard to remember) they were exactly like this. The focus was on adventure, on the bright reporter Tintin and his faithful dog and the positive, cartoonish way the world is depicted.The film itself is 3D, which doesn't really help it. And I mean that. I can imagine this in a anime style or even that French style of 2D animation and I believe it would have been better. Also, being the original Belgian comic, it would have made more sense in French. I mean the Tintin and Milou names really do sound better in French. But that doesn't mean the film wasn't really well done, because it was.I can still remember how it felt when I was reading the comics and it felt funny and dangerous at the same time. When the iconic beads of sweat jumped from Tintin's head I knew things were serious. The film goes too much in the direction of kid films, with very little tension.I have to conclude, though, that it was a well made film. I didn't enjoy the 3D animation, but it was well done. The story, consistent with the comics, were a bit too childish, but still nice. I wonder what direction they will go in the next series. I really expected less, but I got something outrageously fun. However I do wonder how the new generations will receive it. Will it feel like a weird European Bugs Bunny? Because then they would have completely missed the point. It's all about adventure! The kid version of Indiana Jones.",7,1,3,26 January 2013
Crash," Good 'everything connects and acts have consequences' movie
","Unfortunately, I've seen several movies like this in the last year and, even if I liked the film, I do think that too much is too much. I accept that having to have the same characters in every scene forces the screenwriter to think a bit and that having the same actors in all the scenes reduces the costs of the movie dramatically, but I shouldn't suffer from it! :)OK, on the more serious side, this is a good movie. Some of the scenes are hilarious and it is not overly dramatic, as most of the movies of this type are. However, I feel they pushed the interconnectivity a little too far. I mean, the same people meet over and over again ... in L.A. That's statistically improbable.Also, not being an American, it is hard for me to judge how real the film is. Is the racism such a big problem there? Does it affect every level of society as the movie showed? Are Iranians really not Arab? :) OK, joking here. Conclusion: watch it, it is worth it, but don't expect too much.",7,0,4,27 November 2005
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Better, but way over the top
","This Spider-Man doesn't suck and it was enough for everybody to praise the film. But I say it is not enough. The greed that made the cinematic universe to even exist and mix everything up together is also responsible for the way this movie went over any limit where it is simply fun.So you have the typical story: Spidey is a 15 year old kid in high school, with all the issues associated with it, but he is also the prot√©g√© of Tony Stark, Mr. Iron Man himself. That means Chitauri technology, amazing suit that does everything (with the eternal question about why not every Avenger would have one) all mixed up with high school jokes and teenage issues.The ending kind of saves the movie, when Parker says he would rather not be an Avenger and keep taking care of 'the little guy', but really, half of the movie was Peter talking to his suit (I mean, having Jennifer Connelly everywhere you go would be kind of nice, but still).The villain was good, but hard to swallow. I mean Michael Keaton was perfect as The Vulture, but it's hard to believe a construction company manager would have what it takes to create the suit.Bottom line: Everything is just jumbled together and it was the actor performances that saved what is, quite clearly, a mess.",8,0,2,8 October 2017
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," An excellent movie
","What can be added about this movie that hasn't been said already? Here I am, making a comment about a movie I first see after 50 years from its making. But there is so much to say that I can't really help it.This movie is a dark irony. I cannot in good conscience call it a comedy, for the laughter that it causes is not a funny one, but one of sadness. You see this beautiful movie, so recent feeling half a century after it was shot, with extraordinary casting, acting, directing and attention to detail, and you recognize in it all the ugliness that resides in all humans and humanity as a whole. This movie is to be watched, seen, partially understood, then watched again and again.OK, Petter Sellers is 'the man' in this movie. Not just a man, but at least three, as I am not sure of the soldiers that were shot from behind (by the cameras :) ). George C. Scott is great as a silly general, the rest of the cast performs great, too, although for a movie that shows so much attention to minutiae, I guess they couldn't have acted bad if they wanted to. Kubrick would not have let them.The humor is terrifying and present in almost every scene. You just have to watch this one. Just have to. One of the few movies I gave a 10 to.",10,1,3,2 June 2005
Fast & Furious 6," I wanted to hate the movie, but I've enjoyed it quite a bit
","There have been interesting Furious films, there have been really bad ones and there have been good ones. The sixth part of the franchise is immensely ambitious in terms of special effects and body count, it features all the actors in the previous films, cool machines, scary villain (British, of course) and, against my better judgement, was fun! So in terms of car chase films, it was one of the better ones.This doesn't mean it was perfect. High speed chases through London, tanks killing tens of people by driving over cars, the damn American movie arithmetic that counts a victory the saving of a main character over a lesser one and the huge amount of physical violence that has to not show blood in order to be OK... all of these made me cringe at times. Also some one liners, but that was to be expected.So it is a viewer choice if the movie is good or not. Mainly it is a gang fight between 'professional criminals', only some are uselessly cruel while the others are 'family'. I am not going to even go into tribal irony here, but you know what I mean.Bottom line: rated it above average for a movie of its kind. The music was not memorable in any way, as in other films. The chases were flamboyant, but not really focused on driver skill except a few of them. Simple, high budget movie, lacking substance, but fun.",8,0,6,5 July 2013
The Expendables," It was fun, but utterly unsatisfying...
","Oh, I have waited for this movie for such a long time. I knew it was directed by Sly Stallone and that the plot could and would not be any complex or good. I was even expecting some bad acting and some personal disappointment. And still, the movie managed to let me down.Yes, the cast is made of action icons of my childhood and youth (and that ought to say something), but the roles are made for only two people: Stallone and Jason Statham. The other guys just happen to be there, say a few lines, do nothing spectacular while the bad guys explode in uninteresting and boring explosions after saying unmemorable lines.Sorry, Mr. Stallone, this movie failed. It was a box office bomb, that's for sure, but the quality... you could and should have done better!Bottom line: it would have been enjoyable in the 80's when I was 8 years old, but not now. Even worse, the characters could have been played by any actor, good or bad, known or unknown, the roles were so simple and plain. So, in the end, I just feel cheated that I watched a bad clich√©d action movie for one single reason: the cast.",6,0,3,13 September 2010
Pan's Labyrinth," Detailed movie with an interesting story, but I didn't like it
","It seems Cuaron didn't do enough with Harry Potter 3, some depressed Latino had to create a really sad and dark children's story. That's just me blowing off steam :)The story itself is interesting enough, if you count it involves a young girl that likes books, unfortunate enough to be the daughter of a woman who breeds children for a living (and not doing a very good job either) in Franco's Spain. If you consider that her newest 'father' is a sadistic army captain, you've got the hallmarks of a cry-your-eyes-off drama.But then the magical world makes its appearance and all that civil war drama becomes slightly bearable while trying to understand what goes on in 'The Underground Kingdom'. Alas, this is dark and depressing, so the only things we see from this fantastic world are just creatures that look like annoying insects or like demons from US horror movies, with the eyes in their palms and such. Then just about everybody dies. And it wasn't even an Asian movie.It reminded me of a movie I once saw with a girl in a boarding house, always telling everybody that she is a princess (and getting hell for it) and that her father is going to save her. And finally her father did save her. The story was so similar that I thought this is a weird remake of it.Bottom line: the details were really great, the story interesting, the acting was superb, the atmosphere and soundtrack well done, but the pace was slow, the movie boring and the whole point of the film just passed me by. Maybe it's just me.",7,2,8,12 January 2007
Knocked Up," Finally, a smart romantic comedy
","I would actually rate this around 8.5, but that's because I had really low expectations to start with. I mean, can you imagine that the sexy yet insanely neurotic blonde from Grey's Anatomy would make a great comedy where she gets pregnant? I expected two thirds of the film to be screams of anger and screeches of estrogen. But no! This film was so funny and smart that I thought it must be Canadian!Short story long: a night stand causes the emergence of a baby. There are issues since the mother is a career woman and the father is a higher-than-life chubby bonger.What I liked most of the film is that the moments of frustration are resolved in mature, intelligent ways, not by bitching and punching. Also people are not really judged. You don't get to see a lousy bum elevated to 'civilisation' just because he gets to slave around for 10 hours a day.Bottom line: great comedy. Appealing both women and males. It does touch a sensitive subject, having children (I very much prefer murder and cataclysm to it), but it is worth it for a rom com.",8,1,5,11 August 2007
The Polar Express," Graphical movie. That's it.
","I didn't like the movie. It doesn't really make me feel Christmasy, nor does it have fantastic animation. The 3D characters have faces emulated after the main actors, probably the movements are also made by a face mesh that translates real actor facial expressions. So, the only things that remain to be appreciated are the story and the non-character graphics.The plot is one of those 'Seems dangerous, but it's marvelous, so it's OK' stories. The things that happen don't really make any sense and everything seems not to have any purpose at all. In the end the children do get to the North Pole, but it is nothing compared with what happened in the train. So the movie is about the journey, not the end.Maybe it's me, but I was bored throughout the movie, and so was my wife. I watched the last half by myself. The musical bits with the dances couldn't have been more out of place. So, no, it's not a good movie. Even for the children.",6,3,8,11 August 2005
The Town," Good flick, but kind of dated
","This is one of those movies which were all the rave in the 70's, with idolized bank robbers that lived fast and hard. However, in 2010 it feels dated. They have cell phones and flat computer screens, but not much else. The skillset used on both sides of the conflict is the same as in an old movie.The film stars Ben Affleck who is also the director and part writer and a bunch of other people, Pete Postlethwaite being the only notable, but with a real small part. Everybody does their parts, the movie is well acted, well directed and the feel of things just right; however, I can't help but feel a bit disappointed by the setting. Maybe things are just like this in Charlestown now and maybe the fibbies are just as dumb in real life, but I kind of doubt it.Conclusion: good enough film for its category, but not exactly my piece of cake. Now alien bank robbers... that would be cool!",8,1,2,10 January 2011
Underworld Awakening," A bit of a flop
","I love Kate Beckinsale and I was waiting for this movie mainly to see her in those tight fitting outfits that she wore in the previous films in the series. But I was also waiting to be again in the fantastic world of ancient vampires and werewolves and the interaction between them. It was not to happen.Maybe it was the lighting or the ridiculous script, but even in the tight pants, Kate did not look juicy. I know it was not her fault. Then the ancient werewolves and vampires... were mostly exterminated by humans before the film even began. The result? A pathetic fight between vampire covens hiding like rats and a werewolf pack of increasing strength, all while the humans (which hunted them all successfully) pretty much stay out of the way.Bottom line: the script made no sense, the actor play was bland and the whole thing was unsatisfying even at the level of guilty pleasure.",6,3,5,1 April 2012
Suicide Squad," Beyond salvation
","This film has the coolest villain entry I've seen in a long while. The scenes with Enchantress taking over her host body and the tentacle attacks of her brother in the very beginning were absolutely breathtaking. As was Margot Robbie's cute behind. Unfortunately, everything else was really really stupid.The thing is that there was the possibility to make this work, but somehow it turned into a badly edited amalgamation of ideas that don't belong together. What was Harley Quinn doing there? How did she further the story in any way? If you eliminate her, you don't need The Joker. Remove completely pointless characters like Katana and Boomerang and you had time for storytelling and character development and amazing action.But no, they had to dump all possible characters in this thing: Batman, Joker, Harley, Katana, Captain Boomerang, Diablo, Killer Croc. Killer Croc was a joke! Because of the heavy makeup you couldn't even recognize Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje even when you knew he was the actor and you could barely understand what he was saying.Plagued by indecision, the studios managed to completely mangle this movie, even if they let it all fall on the head of the guy who appears as both director and writer. From the cast you would think poor David Ayer was solely responsible for the entire film. In fact it's an army of IP lawyers and some money desperate people who are just as pointless as the characters they push down our throats. Bottom line: I can't imagine any way in which this production could have been saved by reshoots or reediting, it's that much of a mess. And it's infuriating because the potential and the people were all there! Will Smith was good, but I felt he was not the right man for the character.",6,1,2,7 October 2016
Shutter Island," Nicely done, I hated it
","If you abstract away the performance of the actors, which was brilliant, the imagery, which was most of the time very good, although sometimes over the top, the movie is a pretty straight forward example of a type that I personally dislike. Telling you what type that is would spoil everything, so I'll just give you this: prepare for an ending that might suck.That being said, let's not abstract the actors yet. Leonardo de Caprio played very well, with a performance reminding me of The Aviator, while the supporting cast, even if having rather limited roles, did their job very well. If you look at the distribution, though, it was only to be expected.The way the movie was shot was very nice, with images both visually nice and emotionally charged. Sometimes, though, special effects and scene manipulation went overboard, as is the case with the dreams and the scene when the German soldiers fall in the same rhythm as the camera moving...Bottom line: if the idea behind it doesn't annoy the crap out of you, then you will probably like it.",7,0,1,26 April 2010
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Surprisingly good
","The power of a mature story becomes apparent yet again in this film. The Marvel heroes stories have been created, changed to fit the times, merged, split, reinvented, all while in the crossfire of devoted fans that see and cry foul at any mistake or inconsistency. That is why Winter Soldier, while mixing up a lot of story lines, heroes and technologies, ultimately works. It is also not boring, as the plot is indeed thick.But that is not all. All the actors played well, and just look at that cast, Scarlett Johansson had a major role and looked as delicious as she ever did, the action scenes were very good and diverse (although I still don't know why people aim at the shield and not at Captain America when they try to shoot him) and a bunch of story lines opened up.As I see it, comic book companies want to recreate the comic universe on video - it makes sense since nobody reads anymore - and that opens a lot of available stories that are both wonderful and terribly silly. If Winter Soldier is at the level of quality of future films in the Marvel universe, I am happy with it.",8,1,2,20 July 2014
Life of Pi," Is the beauty of a story in the telling or in the experience itself?
","I feel conflicted about this movie because, even if it is a visually beautiful film and has a plot of many layers, even if the acting is great and the direction clearly good, at the end I just felt cheated.First, there were the 'ministories', of the origin of his name, the swimmer adoptive uncle and so on. They were mere anecdotes as related to the rest of the plot; they had no point other than to prolong the telling of the story. I am sure all of this would have been clearer in the book, but from the film I just felt like being baited from a story to the other, waiting for the 'real' one to begin.And maybe that was the whole point. The end quote regarding stories and God was relevant. Maybe it doesn't matter if you relate to a story, only that you listen to it told. However, I could not really relate to any character in the film except with the poor tiger. Yeah, I am a cat person.Bottom line: different people will have wildly differing opinions on the film, and that is good, but in the end I feel I can't recommend or not recommend the movie because I am not really clear if I liked it or not. Perhaps reading the book before watching the film would be indicated.",8,0,1,20 January 2013
Doctor Strange," Marvel does it again
","I had low expectations for this film, yet Marvel did it again and created an almost perfect movie. Where it failed, again, was the villain.My early concerns were easily dispelled (pardon the pun), as after 15 minutes of exposition we got right into the action. Cumberbatch is perfect for the role, even if he is, you know, British. Rachel McAdams is lovely, but her role is so purely supporting that the movie doesn't even try to explain how she immediately adapts to a situation that Strange took several special effects heavy hours to.In fact, if I was to voice a critique, it's that besides Strange everybody else was purely a supporting character with no other real reason to exist, and that includes Thor in the after credits scene. Tilda Swinton was amazing as the Ancient One, doing with facial expressions what the writers failed to do in her dialogue, but her character is there just to guide and die. Mads Mikkelsen played such a clich√©d villain that no matter what he would have tried to do it would have fallen short. Don't start me on the henchmen, that didn't even speak. Every single character in the movie except Strange did not need a name or a backstory.Other than that the movie was great. Entertaining action, some funny moments, excellent special effects that somehow didn't jar the brain - well, except maybe the overuse of fractal reality - and good acting all around. It presents us with the superhero paradox again, though: why would a powerful sorcerer with access to time manipulation and an infinity of universes care about protecting Earth? My guess is that there is where the Marvel universe will begin to unravel, when they try to balance the various story lines they started which are orders of magnitude of power apart.",9,1,3,20 November 2016
Interstellar," Another Nolan ego trip
","If you are one of those people that thought Inception was a really good movie and it made a whole lot of sense, then stop reading this review; you will not agree with it.Interstellar is a movie that I have been waiting for a long time, ever since they released teasers and trailers and a lot of science blogs started talking about it. I held myself away from such discussions, though, because I wanted to have an open mind when I watched it. My verdict: really well done movie that made absolutely no sense, in any number of dimensions. People said that it was inspiring; if it inspires anyone, that's good, but don't come crying to me when they come back disappointed that they cannot hear the symphonic music and the BWAAAAANG in space, like they expected it.I really don't want to spoil anything, so I will stop here. It took a mere 15 minutes for me to start gritting my teeth and it only became worse as time went by for the entire three hour length of this space sham. Prepare yourselves for Nolan's attempt at a Space Odyssey 2001, only with more special effects and no understanding of science whatsoever. It hits all the right emotional buttons and, indeed, if you have the intelligence of a dog, you will love this film at the level that they are so loving towards their masters.Matthew McConaughey is brilliant in his role, all the supporting actors are great, visual effects are good, even if unnecessarily over the top, all the little details are well taken care of... all except a script that makes any sense beyond 'Oh, love, boo hoo!'.Bottom line: my head hurts with angry disappointment. I am at fault for expecting so much from this movie. Another eye candy ego trip from a director that thinks too highly of himself.",7,6,11,25 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," And end of everything
","I am not a Star Wars fan. I've lost count of which trilogy is which and what they are about. I just wanted to see a good sci-fi film and enjoy it as much as possible. Only it made no sense. The only things connecting it to other films were either nostalgic crap or reinventions and apologies of previous ideas that are now cancelled. The only new concepts in the movie made little sense and ended abruptly after being just presented. This doesn't feel like the Rise of anything, it feels like a terrible end where nothing has any value. People hate The Last Jedi. Well, that was kind of interesting, introducing new things to a tired little fairytale. Not good by any measure, but at least not boring. Rise of Skywalker is a Final Order of magnitude worse. No world building, no consistency of character, rushed, badly edited, the inbreeding of everyone with everyone, a consistent obliteration of any purpose, feeling or technical concept. It was a thorough Sithesque dismantling of Star Wars. But worse of all, because I really am not a fan and so I couldn't care less about this franchise, this film was boring as hell.",5,2,7,14 March 2020
Pacific Rim," Leave your brain at home and you will love this film
","This film is a successful blend of Japanese mecha and American hero movies, although I personally am not a fan of either. Therefore the fact that I liked it has to mean something. First thing you have to do in order to enjoy the film, though, is leave out logic, critical thinking or any knowledge of physics and/or biology. This is not a movie about real life, so deal with it. Once you do that (bring nothing to the drift, so to speak) you will probably enjoy the film because it is really well done and lots of fun.The plot is simple: on the bottom of the Pacific ocean there is a dimensional rift through which giant Godzilla like monsters are coming through. The human solution is to build giant humanoid robots and punch the monsters to death. Yeah, I know. In a way, it is a sort of Top Gun with interdimensional alien monsters rather than Russians. Also the main character is impossible not to like: he is heroic, but also thoughtful and calculated, so completely different from Maverick.As usual, Idris Elba is a supporting character who by his selfless actions saves the world, then dies and the beautiful Caucasian lead gets all the credit. A tip of the hat to the Japanese origins of the mecha mythos, the female lead is Japanese, although she doesn't do much. Other known actors have small roles, to my chagrin. Ron Perlman plays as well (stay until the credits to see a final scene with him). The scientists are great, although perhaps their geekiness is a bit over the top and unnecessarily so.The special effects are almost flawless and, combined with heroic music and bar fight action scenes enlarged times a million, makes it almost impossible not to have fun. Heed my advice and do not think of solutions to the problems presented in the film, or you'll feel like the guy in the Shark Pool trailer. Just go with the flow. I find it ironic that in order to enjoy the film most you must follow the instructions given to the Jaeger pilots. I do hope that was intentional, if a bit cynical.Bottom line: I was sure I was not going to enjoy it and I was very wrong. My head still buzzes with alternative scenarios in the same conceptual world, but the path that Guillermo del Toro took was both crowd pleasing and respectful to the feel of Japanese mecha, thus I have no quarrel with it at all. So go watch the film.",8,3,5,14 October 2013
American Sniper," A neutered Hurt Locker
","Back then, I really loved Hurt Locker, for its depiction of hopelessness, randomness of death (remember Guy Pierce dying in the first 15 minutes?) and the detailed portrayal of human feelings through action. I truly believe it deserved the Oscar and I truly felt the obscenity of war watching it.Now American Sniper is sort of the same, great direction, great acting, famous director, story about the war in Iraq. However, it has no balls. The Jihadi are all the same, mindless faceless barbarians attacking and killing from hate alone. The Americans are all nice guys with a life back home, protecting each other. The lead actor is a walking clich√©: the Texan who is taught by his father to believe in God, shoot and protect the weak and goes to war when he sees a bomb attack at an American embassy abroad. Basically all characters are cardboard.Within minutes you know that it will all going to be a propaganda piece. This movie lets every American redneck have a picture of Chris Kyle on the wall above their bed and to want to kill some 'Hajjis'. Eastwood defended his film as antiwar, but I call BS. The hero of the film went to Iraq 4 times and the movie kind of lets the viewer believe he would have returned if it weren't for this wife and children nagging on him. The only antiwar piece in the entire story is in that one line of text at the end of the film.Now, I don't know what Chris Kyle wrote in his book, nor do I know if the depiction of his character was accurate in both book and film. But if this film was supposed to be antiwar, it failed miserably.",7,1,10,8 February 2015
Southpaw," Great performances in a decent plot
","I am not a fan of sports movies, but this film has a few things going really well for it.The biggest is the actor performances, with Jake Gyllenhaal playing one of the roles of his life and Forest Whitaker coming a close second. But I am not discounting the secondary roles, either: even the child actor was really good, even the 'villain'!Then there is the story. Instead of starting from the bottom and overcoming adversities to become great, our hero starts off as the champ, then loses everything that ever meant anything to him and he has to find his way back from despair.And final and third point is that the story is adapted from the life of Eminem translated into boxing. So it's basically a sequel to 8 Miles :)Bottom line: I watched the film with interest even if it's not the type of things I usually go for, mesmerized by Gyllenhaal's performance.",8,0,0,5 October 2016
Ant-Man," Proof that Marvel can't get everything right
","I realized what Marvel is doing. It took me a little too long to get it, but I got it: they are using movies like market shares, including using the speculative nature of market operations. It's not that they don't know people will get tired of superheroes, they just want to push as many movies in before DC does, get the money and let their competitors reap the market collapse.This is the only reason why a movie like Ant-Man would be made. Not only it is about a person using a special particle to shrink or enlarge objects with no apparent effect on their functionality and interaction with other objects, but they are using these special powers in order to run around, jump and punch people.But even if I were amenable to completely suspending my disbelief and believe in any crazy thing, the movie was plain bad. Unimaginative, clich√©d, even a bit racist, with cardboard characters that are completely unsympathetic, the movie also belies the dated concept that spawned it. It was also a mess as a movie, with scenes from the trailers missing and people getting credit without having any scenes in the final edit.Bottom line: Paul Rudd was fine, Michael Douglas was boring and bland, while the horrible wig of Evangeline Lily made us ask why we thought she was so hot when she played in Lost. Corey Stoll did the best work, even if his character was the minimal evil mad scientist with nothing else to separate him from any other paper villains. If you want to love Marvel films for a while longer, wait until the market crashes and you get into withdrawal before you watch this.",6,2,6,8 November 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," Absolutely ridiculous
","The movie itself had good acting, a nicely crafted modernization of a ridiculous concept (even for when it was created) and good special effects. Unfortunately I have this rating system that forces me to grade movies that can only be enjoyed when drunk with something less than 4. Captain America is such a movie.Don't get me wrong, I have a lot of fun watching ridiculous movies while inebriated, so I am not judging here. I can't imagine, though, enjoying this movie in any other circumstance. I had higher hopes for the film as Hugo Weaver was in it, but alas, he got a small cardboard role than even he could not make interesting.Bottom line: good for 3 year old American children who their parents want to brainwash into becoming soldiers for their country, but otherwise... a film to enjoy when drunk.",Null,1,4,6 November 2011
Fargo," A list of my favorite actors in a film that is both real and completely boring
","I understand the positive reviews, I really do. The story is non conventional, based on real events that lack the serendipity and skill of movie events. The actors, some of my favorites are in it, play very well. The mix of dread, disgust, contempt and amusement has a nice flavour, too. But the film is too real, too mundane and ultimately totally boring. It's like a heist movie done by idiots, but dangerous idiots at that.Bottom line: I really wanted to like this film, because they just released a series based on it. However, after watching it, I can't bring myself to view the series. The average grade that I give this film doesn't mean that I am indifferent to it, just that it kind of hits mediocrity, but that only because I average good acting and intriguing potential with my feeling of utter boredom after watching it.",7,1,1,25 June 2014
Rush," Completely unexpectedly good
","I have to admit I watched this film for reasons that had nothing to do with it, it was a completely random choice. I even looked it up first just to see what it is about before I started watching it and was kind of put off by being a sports movie about car racers. I have to also admit that I think the sport itself quite silly, even amongst other silly sports. But the film was so good that I had to rate it top grade.The story is a classic conflict between the clear headed unpleasant man racing cars for money and the maverick charismatic risk taker that does it for the kicks, but unlike most American movies, it does not turn one into a hero and the other into a villain. Instead it presents the world of racing as it was back then: high risk of injury and death, the glory and the pain, the races that are not cancelled if people paid too much for viewing rights no matter the risks, the gladiatorial adrenaline filled world of the racers themselves.But what was better than great acting, great directing and a wonderful story was the refreshing perspective from actual people with actual lives and problems and emotions. It was so personal and so touching that I believed it to be Lauda's own biography and searching for it I see that he actually published one, called To Hell and Back, yet the script is not based on that, but on the work Peter Morgan did with constant input from Lauda. Daniel Bruhl's extraordinary performance was also honed by him spending time with Niki Lauda.Not everybody is happy with the film, though. Some think that the film pales in comparison to John Frankenheimer's Grand Prix, a movie that I have no watched. It might make a good viewing if you like this one.All in all, I really appreciate the effort done in researching and planning the film as well as the wonderful performances and directing. Carjack TV videos show Lauda and Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl interviews of the film which might come nicely after watching the movie. Great job all around!",10,0,1,29 August 2015
Nightcrawler," A psychopathic satire of the American dream
","It is difficult to find any flaw with this film. Jake Gyllenhaal is fantastic in this, easily outperforming Donnie Darko, all the other characters (the few that they are) are perfect support, the direction is good, the soundtrack appropriate. Everything, just great. But as I am prone to do, I rate highest the story, which is simple, but to the point, a perfect satire of the American dream.The main character is a textbook psychopath. He feels no remorse or empathy, has an above average intelligence and his only goal (as far as the movie goes) is to make money. We see him as a lowly thief at the beginning of the film, stealing and selling wire fence, but he quickly evolves as he finds his niche: nightcrawling, which is driving as fast as possible to 911 call locations and recording video to be sold to TV stations. In everything he does he uses and speaks corporate clich√©s on how to improve your business and, if you ignore the ethical and moral, as he does, he does everything perfectly well and 'by the book'.The ending of the film disappointed many, but I think it was the perfect twisting it in. Can't say much about it without spoiling it, but for me it cemented the pure satirical purpose of the movie. Do watch it: great performances, slow rise of tension and a constant feeling of wrongness, like things are not really like that, up to the end, where you finally get it and feel disappointed not by the movie, but by the real world.",9,2,3,2 January 2015
Oblivion," Big budget for a simple plot, but effective
","There are a lot of good things going for this film: the special effects are flawless, the actors play well, the production values are high. Even the script is not the usual mess that US films have made us be used to. If there is a problem with Oblivion, it is that it is a too good a movie for its own story.OK, there is a twist, somewhere, but you need to not watch the trailer and be rather unconcerned to not see it miles ahead. There are action scenes, but not that many, so you can't go calling it an action film that doesn't need a story. Nor is the story badly written. It just feels so like one of the episodes of Outer Limits that it makes one uneasy while watching. Like something is missing, but you can't place your finger on it. And while it works on delivering the predictable finale, it starts losing its consistency and gaining logic holes that are the hallmark of careful work that was rushed at the end.In a way, it's a very expensive play. If you ignore the extras and the few scenes in which Jamie Lannister still has a hand, there are five actors in total. Some might multiply this with 50 or even 1000, but the actual actors are just five :) So my conclusion is that it was an entertaining film, with full control over the vertical and the horizontal, but less over depth of story. It reached a sort of uncanny valley for which production values are so disproportionately high compared to the complexity of the story that is made me uneasy.",8,1,5,18 April 2013
Bohemian Rhapsody," Malek is great, the bio pic recipe is quite formulaic
","Hollywood does biographies like they do their films: they take reality and cut and rearrange and fake it until it makes money. A lot of moments were more dramatic than what really happened or even fictitious, but it all looks good. You get the feel for Freddie's forced confidence, always looking forward, living the day, but at the same time remaining a scared little kid that needs friends and is vulnerable to bad influence. Also the band didn't split on his account alone, they all went and did their own thing once in a while, but always came back. It wouldn't look good on film, though. So while I enjoyed the film, it felt like so many other movies I've seen. The AIDS stuff is also very mixed around.But Rami Malek was great. At the beginning I was having doubts, I don't think he had gotten used to the false teeth and he looked kind of uncomfortable, but really fast he got into the role so well that him and Freddie mixed up in my mind. I thought it would be off putting because he looked so much like that kid in the Invisible Man video (they didn't get the hair quite right), but he was really good.So bottom line: great music, great performances, the story a bit bland and formulaic. A solid 8/10.",8,2,2,14 February 2019
Burn After Reading," Crash meets American Psycho, but all characters are morons
","Actually, it was a fun film. I wasn't laughing too much, but I was amused all the time watching it.It is hard to tell you something about the plot without spoiling it. Just expect not to know what will happen, which is the best part of the film, while the actors are doing pretty spectacular acting, even if the roles themselves are not particularly interesting.Bottom line: it is funny, in a 'what a moron!' type of way, which was a little disappointing, but has lots of twists and great production values. So, it's worth it. Definitely better than any movie I've seen lately...",8,1,6,14 December 2008
The Last Legion," Gladiator meets Knights of the Round Table
","This had all the right ingredients: Colin Firth and his humour, Aishwarya Rai and her looks, Ben Kingsley and his acting and most of all it was a British production, so it could have been more original.Somewhere along the way they lost it. Colin Firth took the role of the general, Aishwarya Rai killed more men than all the guys combined, Hollywood type gloriously epic music (I am glad it wasn't Indian singing, but still), some of the lamest motivational speeches of all time broke the film... all these elements broke the film.For something that had all this raw stuff, it ended up really bad, like some sort of expensive yet unsavoury meal.Oh, and the moral of the story: Arthur was really Italian. Born from Roman parents and raised by a Roman man and an Indian woman. ;)",6,1,4,23 October 2007
Watchmen," Finally a full 10 sci-fi movie!
","I am faced with no option. This film had a great script, good acting and directing, wonderful soundtrack, amazing courage. And it's SF! It just has everything right. I have to award it the highest mark.A lot of things have been said about Watchmen, the comic, as being the best comic in the last 25 years, being impossible to put on screen, being too dark. I obviously can't agree wholeheartedly, but it is clear that the movie was possible, it was great and it was as dark as they come.The title hints on what the story is about: who watches the watchmen?, them being not a bunch of goodie-goodie moral archetypes, but as human as they can possibly get: cruel, damaged, afraid, all powerful, etc. What can... no, what will they do with all that power, in a world that, convinced it no longer needs them, is heading for almost certain nuclear holocaust?I am keeping this movie and highly recommend it to anyone. Not only it was a great watch, but to actually see this coming out of Hollywood makes me have a little hope for the future of cinematography.",10,1,5,5 July 2009
Baby Driver," Meticulously technical movie, but just a typical heist plot
","I am not one to notice details, but I do care about them when I do. This movie is very carefully crafted, a choreography of sound, action and movie edit. All the acting is beautiful and, if you are into movies, you should definitely watch this.However, if you care about the story, it is as plain as it could be. It is the story of a getaway driver, stuck against his will in a mobster's contract. Everything that happens is pretty much obvious. If you are not one for details, but care about the story, it will probably not excite you at all, even if there is nothing wrong with it per se.Bottom line: watch some actors have fun in a movie where the writer/director had some fun. That's always good. Try to have fun as well, because at times it just feels like a movie for movie makers.",9,13,24,14 September 2017
Justice League," Finally fun
","I am all for brooding and dark. If it were me, the DC Universe movies and series would all be rated R. Yet, I also need to have fun and this is kind of what Justice League was. It's two hours long, but the actual fight with evil is in the last 15 minutes and almost inconsequential. The dynamic between the characters, in the end, is why the movie is worth watching. And, spoiler, Superman's not dead... he's just ridiculously overpowered, which makes the entire League concept kind of pointless. That's where the fun comes in. Go watch the film, turn your brain off a little, and enjoy. The true depth of the Justice League concept can never be reached in any type of movie. You have comic books and animations for that. Now, Cyborg was awesome. In this digital age he might even be overpowered himself, but his character wasn't truly explored. Aquaman looked good, but for the life of me couldn't see his point. The Superman/Batman/Wonder Woman trio worked great, as it did in the movie before (quit whining and watch the extended version). That leaves Barry Allen, who was kind of fun. There are holes in the logic of... well, everything, but I reiterate: fun!",8,3,4,26 December 2017
Man of Steel," 21th century Superman
","Henry Cavill is doing his best to play Michael Fassbender playing Superman in this movie :-), and he does a very decent job. I couldn't have imagined a better modern Lois Lane than lovely Amy Adams and Michael Shannon is a great Zod, so casting is top notch. Of course, a bit of Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Laurence Fishburne and Russell Crowe as supporting actors didn't hurt either. And I expect to hear more from the delicious Antje Traue.When one thinks of Superman, they get an image which is more or less different based on when that person was born. You have the funny old Superman, flying in his pajamas in comic books, you have Christopher Reeves battling a diabolical Gene Hackman, maybe one of the TV series Supermen or even a cartoon Superman, either from TV or some console game. The fact is that it is increasingly difficult to talk about the same character with so many reinventions in as many eras. In the 21th century, Lois Lane is an independent woman who doesn't need to swoon over Superman and she knows that he is Clark Kent, even under the clever disguise of large rimmed glasses. The origin story is also retouched a little, with a very nice intro on Krypton, laden with special effects.I liked that the space and ship camera work (as well as some of the supporting cast) were borrowed from Battlestar Galactica. The same slightly shaky quick zooms and camera turns, like there is an observer in space eager to record events. The 3D touch interface that the aliens used was also interesting, as design goes, even if I think it would have been impractical in real life.So overall a very good Superman movie (considering the bar was very low to begin with), but there were things that were not as good. One of them is the physics of things. Very difficult to gauge what level of physical violence will hurt or not a Kryptonian, as they seem to respond randomly to varying methods of attack or to forces like inertia. New York is destroyed almost completely just because sir Punch-a-lot would not fight in a field or a small town and kept going to space and then returning to smash in the buildings of New York again. After he has finished with Zod, the Big Apple must have looked like an Apple logo. The fighting also took a lot of time out of the movie in detriment of character building scenes.But I think that what is the best feature of Superman is that none of the characters is stupid. Zod is brutal and, from our standpoint, probably insane, but he has layers of complexity that show him acting within reason. His fascist female sidekick is also believable as a villain. The military, as outgunned as they are, don't act like complete morons. Superman is not just acting cool, he is also capable of thought. I really enjoyed a film that doesn't treat its audience like it's too stupid to understand complex characters.Bottom line: for a Superman movie, this is probably one of the best, if not the best. A well chosen Lex Luthor will probably make the new revamped Superman be even cooler in the sequels. I would love to see a sequel with Doomsday as the villain, too! Not much humor in the film, though. I felt that as a loss.",8,3,6,7 November 2013
28 Weeks Later," Excellent as a horror movie, but not very realistic
","As zombie movies go, this is a really good movie. John Murphy's soundtrack is really powerful, the scenes are rough and intense without being gratuitous, the acting is reasonable.I compare zombie movies with colonial army movies. You know, naked drug crazed Africans attack the organized British armies and win because no one expected them to be so ferocious and oblivious to pain. But this can only work once. Someone please tell me why no one put an automated machine gun on a pole. Or simpler still, bring a tank! As soon as a zombie appears, everybody starts acting like a scared kitten!And there is a personal disappointment here as well. I knew the movie was with Robert Carlyle and I expected a larger, maybe lead role, as I know he is a great actor. Well, if I think about it, the role was big compared to those of the other actors.Anyway if you want thrills, this is the movie for you. But you gotta bring your own suspension of disbelief and leave your woman some place else.",8,0,2,15 March 2008
Bridge of Spies," Philadelphia meets Schindler's List
","Personally I thought the movie was a bit too heavy-handed and that the ending was way more melodramatic than it should have been. But the movie was good. More than that, it is a story that must be shown today. I felt the ending kind of ruined the effect a little bit, though.The story is that of a lawyer who believes in the law - imagine that - and because of his extraordinary efforts to defend a Russian spy in the heavily patriotic legal system from 1957 he is tagged to intermediate a prisoner exchange. You get this idea directly from the trailer and the plot, as it were, is not deviating from that. Instead, it is Hanks' acting and Spielberg's directing that you need to appreciate, as they masterfully make the case for the spirit of America, not for its power.The film is based on a real person, and his own autobiographical book, and it is well rendered, albeit a bit paint-by-numbers. The title of my review is more accurate than I would have wanted. Even so, I felt that the first part of the movie was great and that it should have been a film on its own. You get a man that is doing his job and upholding the moral values Americans are so proud of by defending a man that everyone thinks is despicably guilty and as reward gets scoffed at, gets the evil eye and even has shots fired at his house - 2nd amendment style - from a driving by car, only to be blamed for it by the police officers called to investigate. He returns to his job only to find that cases he was assigned to were reassigned and his partners are reluctant to speak to him.That message is far more relevant today than the general result driven heroics that movies - including this one - usually portray. The point is that good means different things for different people and therefore it never actually wins. The fact that Donovan had a successful career as a negotiator later on is good for Donovan, but I felt it hurt the movie.",8,0,1,30 December 2015
Cold Mountain," Kind of slow drama
","This is one of those movies you know how they're going to be from the first scenes. You do see the male and the female liking each other, you know they are going to fall in love, but you watch it all the same to see HOW they are going to proceed on doing that. You know there is a war and you already know how it's going to end, but you watch the fight scenes anyhow. You know he is going to die because she saw it in a prediction and in the movies predictions are law, but you still watch to see how he is going to die. You know who the bad guys are, you know they are going to die every one of them, but you watch to see it happened and get that feeling of relief that life does have a point.OK, the script was better than the average romantic drama, the actors all played well, the sound and direction were great, so you can call Cold Mountain a good movie, but only taken separately from all the other movies in the genre from which it parts only minutely.The nice landscapes in the background are Romanian, by the way, and this is one of the reasons why I chose to see this movie. And while I managed to endure its entire length without fast forwarding and I watched it with my wife, I would not do it again.Conclusion: this is one of those movies you watch with the lady. Nothing more, nothing less. It's not terribly romantic, either, as it fails to convey that 'Ooo' feeling that makes women feel warm inside.",7,1,3,19 June 2005
North by Northwest," Silly by today's standard, but those standards were set by this film
","I got tired of seeing all kind of references to North by Northwest in American movies and not remembering a bit of it. So I got the film and watched it. It was both exhilarating and completely goofy. I mean, it's 1959 , the clich√©s are different and many of the ones to come will be based on the ones in the movie.Cary Grant can't help but get the girl, his suit is almost spotless no matter what he does in it and how many days he is running by both police and bad guys in it and both FBI and baddies are pretty much ridiculous. Why did they abduct him in the first place? Why fake the death by drunk driving if they already knew he was a government agent? Why does the girl so blatantly, even by today's standards, hit on Cary Grant and he just doesn't get it's a ruse? How can one expect to successfully murder someone from a crop dusting plane using a machine-gun? Why all old guys in movies at that time come from education establishments?But at that time, it must have been great. I can imagine a remake with Ben Affleck and Scarlett Johansson. Vincent D'Onofrio as Vandamm, Martin Landau as The Professor, for continuity's sake :) Bottom line: is it the marvelously witty masterpiece of cinematography that I kind of expecting? Definitely not. Was it a good '59 movie? Hell, yeah! It's Cary Grant, dood! ;)",8,2,7,5 September 2009
Knowing," How come M. Night Shyamalan didn't do this film?
","Imagine Signs with a better budget moving slowly but surely towards The Happening. That's this movie. I have to say that the acting was good, the plot entertaining and the technical realization very nice. I just couldn't relate to any of the characters. Self centered, in a perpetual denial of any logical consequence of their action, emotion driven. No wonder in the end people watching Discovery and National Geographic got the longer stick :) (for once!)There isn't much else I can say. It's a good sci-fi movie, with plenty of tension and wonder. I really disliked the whole religious Rapture thing, but hey, people have to get their budget from somewhere.Bottom line: one of the better Nicholas Cage films, I was beginning to think he is hopeless. Superb special effects without them being overused. Decent plot. Nice classical soundtrack.",8,2,5,21 June 2009
Hugo," Was meant to be beautiful, but hit slightly astray
","You could imagine from the name, from the director and producer and from the trailer that this film is going to be an extravaganza of marvel and beauty. Indeed, it is a movie about finding purpose, about old mechanical machines, books and movies, about happy endings. It should have been a wonderful film and, in part, it mostly was. But I can't help feel that it missed its target. The images were not as wondrous as they were meant to be, the child actors were not terribly easy to empathise with and the reactions of characters in the film were pretty weird to begin with. It all left me in the 'uncanny valley' when you know something is off, but you can't just put your finger on it.That doesn't mean the story was not interesting, the budget high and the interpretation good. It starred Ben Kingsley and Christopher Lee, for crying out loud, and it was about one of the oldest and greatest film makers of all time. The movie was close to great. Just close.",8,0,2,20 April 2012
U-571," Hollywood all the way. And what was Jon Bon Jovi doing in this movie anyway?
","Cool US marines try to capture that elusive Enigma machine that does the decoding of radio messages, while stupid Germans are tricked again and again and again. The only good thing Germans do is build u-boats, and it comes in handy when a few of the Us get stranded on a damaged enemy sub and need to get the captured machine back into Allied hands.Well, I might exaggerate a little. This is clearly not such a puerile movie like the ones they did right after the war. I mean, there is a German prisoner that does all kind of bad things while trying to escape, thus giving credit to the Nazi navy, there are tough decisions that the skipper has to take, but overall the Americans are the good guys and the Germans are mindless killing drones.While reading the other user comments I realized that the movie isn't even accurate, so the only good thing about it remains the acting (come on, it wasn't bad) and the production. An enigma (pun intended) for me is why did Bon Jovi accept to play in this movie. He has shown he has actor qualities, he is a known public figure, what the hell did he think when he accepted a part with a sentence or two and a stupid death right at the start?Conclusion: you want to know how people felt inside u-boats, read books or at least watch documentaries. You want a quick cheap fun movie, watch this.",6,0,3,10 June 2005
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Pushed to watch it, expecting it to be meh, having a lot of fun instead
","I like tongue in cheek humor and this film is filled with it, from the 'is he allowed to legally say that?' to doing to death origin stories. But it's more, the character is likable, the animation very nicely integrated (I loved the internal thoughts also appearing as comic book captions) and the pacing and characters nice. There are some things that are simply cliche, like the black family where people have to take sides either to be gang or state employees in the service of the system, but overall it was pretty nice. Doc Ock was uber cool and I think it was a real loss for missing a scene where she (yup, that how you do representation, with kickass characters!) would meet other versions of herself.Overall, it was one of the best comic book films I've seen, and considering it's animated, that's saying something. I do like the dark side more, though, so lighthearted films rub me a little the wrong way, but since I can't have a Doc Ock series I have to settle :)",9,0,1,16 March 2019
Wanted," The Garb Age
","Can you combine Matrix, Elektra and Equilibrium into a completely pointless exercise that looks good but makes no sense? That was the question asked by some money makers to the director of the movie. Yes, siree, I can!The film starts with a Matrix like scene, continues with the average man learning he is extraordinary, then switches to the group of highly trained assassins that only take 'good' missions assigned to them by 'fate' and continues to ridiculous gun scenes, one in which a bullet has a circular trajectory and kills everyone including the shooter. And it's all in the wrists, ladies and gentlemen!Bottom line: stay away from this simulacrum of a movie. It's nothing but peanut butter and explosive.",6,18,34,12 October 2008
Warrior," Emotional, long, but very good sports drama
","Who will win the fight? Bane or the guy who fought The Thing? Seriously now, the acting in this movie was way above the genre of this film. I know it was a sports fighting movie and I expected things on par with van Damme Asian tournament films. Boy, was I wrong!The first thing to note about the movie is that it is long. It spans two hours and twenty minutes. The first half sets up the characters and how their dysfunctional family got them to where they are. I expected the second half to be filled with fighting action and it was, but only half. The makers of the film realised it was more important to show the mindset and state of spirit of the characters, let them develop rather than show only fights. And so they got a beautiful film.Bottom line: for this genre, the movie is clearly amongst the best. It doesn't uselessly inspire the audience to take up fighting or hate or love one of the characters. Much better, they give us two characters to love and the decision, up to the final fight, is the viewer's: how would you like this fight to end? That question, that situation in which you get to think and choose for yourself is almost unprecedented in a sports movie and more appropriate to more philosophical high brow films and makes the end result irrelevant. Good job!",9,3,5,16 August 2012
We're the Millers," The trailer and some extra bits
","I admit I mostly wanted to see the film because of the striptease bit in the trailer. And, while at her age Jennifer Aniston is pretty hot, the scene was singular and short. The rest of the film does have some merits, but also few and far between.The plot is that of a rather benign drug dealer (ahem!) who needs to do a crazy thing in order to stay alive, basically. He recruits a stripper, a juvenile delinquent and a hapless kid as a cover family. During the eventful trip, they come together as, well, a family. Now, you can imagine this script a thousand ways, one of them at least showing real people with real problems coming together when pressed by the outside world. This could have been a phenomenal dramedy, in my mind. Instead, it went for the brainless laughs, the cheap shots, the as predictable as completely unbelievable story and the lame ha-has to situations that are nothing to laugh about, like being mugged and almost killed, being asked by your employer to have sex with customers, being a socially isolated kid or a homeless adolescent girl with no adult supervision. Am I the crazy one or is it completely insane to know what is going to happen, even while being completely certain it would never ever happen in real life? Exactly what are we buying here?As a result, I could not empathize to any of the cartoonish characters and felt completely disconnected from any of the several amusing scenes in the film. As if being aware of this, the makers of the movie added a bit of bloopers at the end of the film, only those too felt staged and artificial.Rarely I try watching a comedy, hoping that I would be entertained, or trust a trailer to be a significant sample of a movie. Alas, most of the times I meet only disappointment. We're the Millers is clearly one of those times.",7,2,5,13 September 2013
Divergent," Harry Potter in the future
","The film is well done and all the actors are playing OK. That's about all I can say that it good about the movie. The script, though, is terrible. Basically it is about a bored little Amish girl who decides to switch Factions and join the Fascists, just for fun. The faction system is a sort of Hogwarts house system, only people are separated by more clear virtues which somehow need to preclude any others, for no good reason. The training is just like in Harry Potter, seemingly controlled, but actually quite insane. This system is threatened by divergents, people who have characteristics from more than one faction and that 'the system' wants them destroyed. Guess which one is she.Anyway, the movie does possess a subtle irony that I believe was unintentional. A brainwashing movie made for masses of young adults is advocating rebellion against a brainwashing system. Of course, only do that after you trusted the system most of the time and obeyed without question, then found out something so outrageous about it that your only alternatives are fight or die. And I am still not sure whether some part of the film didn't advocate death as a good alternative to resistance. I mean, she had to be really weird and rare in order to do that, so that means the rest of them had no chance to begin with.Bottom line: I felt cheated of more than two hours of my life and offended by the radically dumb message of the story. They fight the system, they win, and still they end up running. And do you know the crazy bitch that started it all? They let her live at the end. Because they are good guys. Sheesh! Just for the annoyance factor, I rate this under average.",6,0,1,23 July 2014
Ender's Game," Phew! They didn't mess it up.
","I vaguely remember the story in the books, but I know that when I read it, a child myself - just like the main character, I was really impressed. The details have been lost in the mists of memory and I know that the following books did not have the same impact, but the first, oh boy, I cried at the end. What remained with me was that the story was essentially antiwar, a cautionary tale against winning a battle while losing ourselves. Antiwar, just like Starship Troopers, and we know how that turned out as a movie franchise.And so I was rather on the edge hoping that they would not mess this up. I am glad to report that they did not... much. True, it would have been impossible to convey more of the book in a film. Even a series would have been ill advised, since the story is, indeed, in the details, but has a major punchline at the end. The book was all about the boy overcoming everything they threw at him: training games, cruel jokes, mind games. There was a lot of space dedicated to his interactions with the computer game, which was adapting itself to the user, revealing much. It was impossible to put this into a film, and this is where there is the pity. Therefore my recommendation is first read the book, then watch the movie, which is a good one, a well made film made by someone who clearly enjoyed and respected the original book.OK, if you are a die hard fan of the book you will start noticing differences in the details or the scene order or even the end of the film, but personally I didn't think it hurt the story much.Now, about the film, I can't really find a fault with it. The cast was perfect, the acting good, the effects well done, but not over done, the music supporting the mood of each scene, but not being exaggerated in any way, the story faithful to the book and the script properly condensed in a movie. I said that there was a lot from the book that could not have been put in the film, but watching it I did not feel rushed, with scenes that make no sense or things moving too fast. Perhaps overall, looking back, it did seem hurried, but I can honestly say that I only realized it when the movie was over and I had to write this review and not during it.I really wonder about the next bit of the story, which is fundamentally different from its start. Will it have to be changed dramatically in order to keep audiences happy, will the screenplay be as good as for Ender's Game and convey to the viewer the emotions and intentions of the book author, thus needing no intervention in the story? And now, while writing this, I wonder if at my age now I would really like the first book a lot more than the rest. Perhaps it would be the other way around.Bottom line: Respecting the original work, the film made me enjoy it even when I knew the plot. I found no real flaw in it, so I am forced to rate it top grade. And what was even nicer, it made me have hope for the next films which now I eagerly await. Good job!",9,1,5,23 January 2014
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Crappy to the point of boring
","There are movies there that are average, others that try their best and fail and then there are films like this, one that the makers know it is a failure from the word go. You get the usual movie candy like weird steampunk weaponry, action scenes, heroes draped in black leather, evil versus good, etc, but just like with the main character in the film, all that candy just makes you sick. Just like the main street in old western movies, it is all just a front with nothing behind it.Sexiness, at least? Maybe a bit of horror, the good old fashioned one that scares you? None. What can you expect from a box office MTV movie, after all? And yet, with low expectations, I was expecting a lot more!Bottom line: a complete waste of time. The bit at the end, which gives hint that there might be a continuation, just feels offensive. It was that bad!",5,2,5,12 May 2013
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Boring movie about nothing
","You've seen it before: a quirky movie that tries (and often succeeds) to be different, funny in an unexpected way, using the power of an interesting plot and even more a cast of sacred movie monsters. I mean how could a movie starring George Clooney, Ewan McGregor, Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey be bad?Well, it was. A movie about superheroes that have no powers but think they do, with a few weird and unexplained phenomena to keep the viewer watching, just like making the least amount of effort to make the film interesting and believable. And that would have been OK, only what they did with their beliefs was not spectacular; place the action in someone's living room and the movie would have been fractionally more boring at almost no cost.Bottom line: great actors play crazy people that do nothing all movie. I got sleepy repeatedly and only watched it hoping that something would explain why I was watching the film in the first place. Nothing did.",6,7,12,4 February 2010
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Winning in some parts, losing in others
","The Mission Impossible franchise was originally a sort of high action serial heist movie. Every film an impossible task was set and they beat it. The strengths of the film were in the technical details, the planning to overcome all odds and the acrobatics of Ethan Hunt. This got old pretty quick and they had to come up with novel ideas, like a worked script and compelling villains.Rogue Nation introduces a compelling villain and shows great work on the script level indeed, so for me this was a win. However, it loses almost everything on the technical and planning stages, making it all seem (as it actually is on the studio) routine. The only problems they have in Rogue Nation are their opponents, and by that I mean the one true villain. The rest, cannon fodder, look as impotent as children compared to all mighty Hunt.While better than I expected, it lost a lot of what made a film a Mission Impossible movie. The villain, the girl, the storyline, they all seem stolen from a James Bond movie. Yes, all MI films do, but this one a lot more than any others.Bottom line: if I wanted American James Bond clones, I would have gone with Jason Bourne. What am I talking about? I am going to watch Jason Bourne, too!",7,0,2,13 October 2015
Jarhead," It was boring, really
","I can understand how this film got so many people to like it. It's a well done film, realistic, no overdramatisation, no special effects... In fact I can imagine a Japanese movie that deals with training samurai then telling them they're obsolete. But until one gets to the basic idea of this two hour movie, one gets terribly bored.Maybe I was expecting something better, more intellectual, or at least more aggressive as an anti war movie. This was only a presentation of the mindset of US soldiers, nothing more, nothing less, thus boring.More than that, the characters were not really developed. OK, these guys were all different, all 'jarheads', but who were they, really? Stripping a character of everything non-marinesque does not define it as a marine.As a consequence, I am grading this movie low.",6,0,1,4 April 2006
Shrek Forever After," A funny fairy-comedy, but not very Shrekish
","The essence of Shrek movies was parody of fairy-tales and the Hollywood world alike, making it a fun and ironic comedy for all ages. Instead, the fourth chapter of the Shrek story was a simple hero-saves-all tale, with all the references going back to previous Shrek films. All in all, a funny what-if remembrance of the whole franchise, but more than anything else, pretty obvious.That doesn't mean Eddie Murphy wasn't a perfect ass, that Antonio Banderas wasn't hilarious as a fat spoiled cat and that Myke Myers wasn't the same hopeless romantic ogre he portrayed in the first three films, but the comedy was situational at best, the story linear and the characters rather plain. I mean, Dragon acted as a dragon, the pigs ate everything, even in the 'good' universe and the witches behaved as perfect German soldiers in American movies about World War 2.Bottom line: fun as a stand-alone movie, but a but of a disappointment as a Shrek film.",7,0,0,28 November 2010
The Intouchables," Emotional tale of true friendship
","If you are looking for a feel good movie that has also deep meaning and true characters, look no further: Intouchables is for you. It is the story of the friendship between a very rich white paraplegic and his low class dark skinned caretaker. Best of all, it is based on a true story, something that brings an extra bit of authenticity to the film, not that the excellent play of the actors needed more.Now, at times it seems too idealistic and probably it is, with the 'lord' giving a chance to the 'peasant' and then becoming friends when intimate enough to learn about each other; a bit like a fairy tale. And I am sure some of the film is just invented. But it doesn't matter. The idea is true, the acting is true and the characters bring a lot of humour and compassion into it.All in all a very nice movie, one that can bring a little joy in an all too serious and dark world.",8,0,0,28 December 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," They did it again..., and again, and again
","An average film for the superhero genre, The Amazing Spider-Man follows the same story from the comics. Exactly as did the previous Spiderman movie, from only 10 years earlier. If anything, it amazes through its sheer mediocrity.The effects are OK, the actors don't seem to be asleep half the time as in the 2002 film, the story is, as I was saying, the same. I can't possibly spoil the plot if you've seen any other Spiderman movie, animation or if you've read the comics.So one has to wonder: why did they do it? Perhaps, as a literature teacher said in one of the last scenes of the film, because there are not only 10 basic plots in all of fiction, but one. Well, I don't buy that.",7,0,2,26 October 2012
The Lego Movie," Not that... err... special
","In this computer animated movie based on Lego pieces, Chris Pratt saves the universe. Again. And while the animation was original and well done while and I don't have any qualms with the actors or direction, this film is just another Hollywood film about the hapless hero who finds it in himself the power to save everybody - if he has a lot of luck - and proves to everybody that he is 'special'.Like many others, when I first heard of the premise of the film I thought I would not see it, but then I heard so many people describing it as a cool movie that, in the end, I gave up and watched it. Yes, it is nicely done, yes it has a lot of nods to other movies, yes it has some funny scenes, but in the end it is just... not special.And I am not saying this because I am mean or because I think a Lego movie should be deep and profound and morally ambiguous so that adults would get it, not just little kids, but because the message of the film is as clich√© and conformist as they come. In a story about people removing the constraints of set rules and following instructions, the main message is 'be yourself!'. That's original.So, yeah, it is a good movie, but it was so over-hyped that I couldn't enjoy its story mediocrity. Huge amounts of money were poured into this film, with good actors used for voice only, cool animation, but the bottom line is that... I've seen this before.",7,0,2,21 January 2015
X-Men: Days of Future Past," One of the better X-Men, but moving a lot towards hard core fans
","I didn't really expect too much from this film, but I had to see it, as I have watched all X-men movies and some of the cartoons. I am not a hard core fan, but I know a thing or two about the X universe. That is why I think the film, while good enough, will be harder to digest for casual movie goers.The plot revolves around the attempt to change the fate of the human mutant war by sending Wolverine's consciousness into the past to prevent the one event that causes that war to begin with. Peter Dinklage's character is the inventor of the Sentinels, the dreaded anti-mutant robots and his murder at the hand of Mystique was the original trigger for the Sentinel program and the war. Now Professor X, Magneto, Beast and Wolverine need to prevent it.I liked that the Sentinels were really presented as terrifying. The character's shenanigans were less impressive, since most of their efforts were spent contradicting and even battling each other, which makes the whole premise of the film moot. Also the disgusting light filter they used at the end to show that 'all is well' didn't sit well with me. The actors played well and even Wolverine certainly looked and acted better than in the horrible Wolverine movie. They completely ignored any law of causality in their interpretation of time travel as well.Bottom line: fantastic actors like McAvoy, Fasbender and Dinklage have to do roles that are kind of silly. The movie is not bad, though, I would even call it engaging. However the unexplained details of the film could push casual viewers away. At the end of the credits there is a scene preparing the next film: Apocalypse.",7,0,1,22 August 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Marvel fails where it lacks experience: behaving as adults
","Marvel has had no problem bringing in wacky heroes and making them feel real, yet when they need to behave like actual people, it all fizzles. Civil War depicts so many characters that it is difficult to bring in a believable villain or to develop any of them, especially with the mandatory action scenes thrown in. In the end you have a two hour and a half mess that shows grown men and women rather punch their way than talk about a common goal.That doesn't mean it's a bad movie, just average and somewhat disappointing. While introducing Zemo, Black Panther and bringing in Spider-Man and Ant-Man, the movie feels more like one of those Mortal Kombat games than a real story. I wanted to shed tears, to understand and empathize with deep character feelings. Instead I got CGI robots fighting CGI captains.Bottom line: more a stepping stone for the MCU than a movie with its own story and soul, it is marginally entertaining, but ultimately teaching nothing and bringing nothing new.",7,4,12,3 September 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Magic is gone, replaced by seven different visual effects companies
","It is always good to try to summarize a movie you've just seen before you judge its quality, and in the case of Fantastic Beasts, the summary simply doesn't make any sense. It mixes things up, bringing up various 'magical and wondrous' situations that, on further scrutiny, simply don't add up. But the special effects are great.One thing you learn, though, by... err... watching between scenes? is that they have fully prepared for sequels. They have prepared a purely American magical world, with its own quirks and idiosyncrasies, brought in characters that did almost nothing, but are interpreted by great actors like Jon Voight and Johnny Depp, they left some things unsolved and they made the effort to force Eddie Redmayne act very well in this film.However, one question I have to ask: why on Earth would anyone want sequels to this? It was a bland, nonsensical film filled with impossible to empathize characters like an almost autistic hero that loves animals more than people, an ambitious yet mostly incompetent auror that puts everyone in danger for her own sake, a child like floozy that reads minds only when it doesn't matter and a non magical character that does nothing but follow people around. The villain is hiding his intentions for the entire movie only to expose them for all to see in the final scenes for no real reason. The rest is filled with a side story about child abuse and special effects over special effects.OK, I agree, people are hungry for magic. Anything would work, as exemplified by many of the nonsensical plots in Harry Potter that everyone just gobbled up, but at least those were real books, with real story lines. This was just an 'Insert coin' sign made into a movie. I lost all confidence that Hollywood, J.K.Rowling advising or not, is capable of bringing the sense of magic and beauty that the original books and films had.Bottom line: Probably Redmayne is an awkward person in real life, too, so it wasn't too difficult for him to play the role, but act he did and he did it well. For that alone I rate this average. Other than that, a pretty picture with no substance and a bitter aftertaste of greed.",7,1,3,26 February 2017
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," They are Canadians
","Michael Cera is a strange beast. As a friend of mine said, he is in a category of his own. If he had been born American, he would have been the eternal geek, rejected by women and beaten up by jocks. Instead, he is Canadian, so he is like a superstar or something. The movie is also like that. It makes sense to geeks, that is true, but also it can only do that with a Canadian cast.What is it about? Michael Cera's character is a guy playing in a band and having a girlfriend that is way too immature even for him and that he hardly touched. He gets a dream about a girl, then he literally meets her, the girl of his dreams. He has to battle her seven former exes (you will see a lot of X-es in the movie) to keep the girl. Also he will have to explain to his current girlfriend why he suddenly doesn't put up with her puerile crap.To do so, though, he employs his magical gaming skills and the beauty of the film is in the multiple references to game and movie culture. It is not a parody, though, only a very beautifully geeky film. You can understand why I will rate it high.Bottom line: it is obvious why the film reached a cult status in the geek community, but the movie works on several levels of comedy and thus can be enjoyed by everybody. It was a fun film that I can recommend.",8,1,3,25 November 2013
Inside Out," Don't believe the hype!
","We know Pixar can do animation. Is the animation in this one good? Yes, it is, I admit it wholeheartedly. The rest is the story, which is boring as hell.We are used to animations from Pixar that are watchable by the entire family, with enough oomph to make children happy and enough subtle smart to make the adults enjoy the movie. This one is a failure not because children won't enjoy colorful impersonations of base emotions, but because for an adult it all goes from boring to insulting.There is an enormous hype calling this an intelligent story that talks about the inner emotions of children and people in general. It does, but with the subtlety of a sledgehammer. I dumbfoundedly watched a confused jumble of 1940 psychology colored psychedelically to please infants and high people and that had only one hint towards sexuality and none about actual conflict.Not only this could have been better in all respects (maybe including animation), but the best parts for me where that they didn't use celebrities for voice actors and the funny credits scenes. The rest was like watching little kid cartoons, you know, the ones that we wouldn't want any child to watch because they look like they're made by psychotic Coca Cola addicts, but they still put them on on every TV post made for kids.The 'deep' message of the film, that we don't have to always be happy and that sadness has its purpose and that things are not only black and white (or blue and yellow, whatever) cannot save the utter boredom and pointlessness of the rest of the film. Compared to other Pixar films, this is a disgrace.Bottom line: I am afraid the only thing I don't feel about this movie is joy. Plenty of anger, disgust and sadness, though.",6,9,33,29 September 2015
Avengers: Endgame," A nice looking solution for an imperfect situation
","Imagine you have to write Endgame. You would have to find a way to reconcile several things: the expectations of the audience, the continuity not only with the other movies, but with future projects and past comic book ideas, the actors that just won't come back whatever the reason, America's unhealthy obsession with political correctness, the wishes of the producers, the wishes of the director, the wishes of the people paying for the movie. It is an nearly impossible task. As a solution to this conundrum, Avengers: Endgame was really decent. It has character build up, exposition - maybe too much of it, foreshadowing, great action scenes, great emotional scenes, great acting. It got rid of all the leaving actors in a very nice way for their characters. It solved the problem of the death of so many living creatures in a way that didn't mean everything was simply undone or redone or forgotten.That being said, all the characters in this film are dumb. I mean, really dumb. They have lightning fast reactions, but their solutions are ridiculous. The whole concept of the solution, which I don't want to spoil, lends itself to improvement.; it was not spent in this story. Also, there is a key moment that ends (heh) it all... it could have been done minutes before. All the elements where already there. And there are so many logic holes in the plot that my mind just reels from thinking about it.Bottom line: a very beautiful film for your heart. Doesn't do your brain any good.",8,0,4,19 May 2019
Quantum of Solace," Say what you will, I actually liked it
","Daniel Craig is the most believable secret agent yet. In this film he doesn't even use the typical gadget car, he uses only his instinct, speed and raw, rough, morality.So yes, there is no dark humour, almost no humour at all, it is all all action, fast and hard to fathom, but it felt more real than the convoluted scripts of past Bonds, ridiculous jokes in the face of death and unbelievably flashy villains.Bottom line: Craig raises this movie to above the average mark I would have given it. It is not his fault that the writers are somewhat torn between the original Bond and the current expectation of the public and movie producers. It almost got close to the Bourne series in quality and it makes me want to see another installment of the 007 franchise.",8,2,8,8 December 2008
No Country for Old Men," Unpredictable, but not all that captivating
","The actors play great, the casting is appropriate and the direction flawless. There is no soundtrack. To me it felt like someone wanted to make a movie that felt real, and so it did. It is hard for me to comment on it without revealing the best part, the thing that one understands only after watching the whole movie.I don't understand why they had to cast Kelly Macdonald (a Scottish actress) as a Texan wife with an Ukrainian mother :)There are people that did not like this movie, and I can understand why. No special effects, no soundtrack to tell you how to feel, lots of dead people, but only for a few do we see how they die, and the only thing to be learned from it is that nothing goes as you want in real life. It was a bit slow at times, too. But it was worth it for the atmosphere and the general effect.Bottom line: This is not of those movies you watch a little at the start and a little at the end and you don't miss anything, it has an overall thing that must be experienced. A real movie, in a multitude of senses. However, movies are not made 'real' for a reason. Most people don't want real when going to the cinema.",8,2,4,27 September 2008
District 9," Fantastic movie
","I believe the greatest damage to this film was made by the people who promoted it, the trailers showing aliens and explosions and all that crap. The movie is actually about something else entirely and the 'movie' violent moments are few at the end. There is real violence in the everyday actions and behaviour of the people involved, though, the status quo that lets you be a smiling bureaucrat doing his job killing children and dispossessing helpless people.What I think is worth mentioning is that Peter Jackson did not direct this movie, he was only the producer. The director and writer of the movie is Neill Blomkamp, who I was surprised to see, directs and writes for the first time. I look forward to see any of his movies, provided there are courageous people like Jackson to back him up financially.Back to the movie, another review talked about kindred spirits. I disagree. When people get together out of necessity, that is not kinship, but rather pure selfishness. And if at the end there were clear moments of sacrifice and valor, it is a mistake to forget the smiling baby burner from the beginning of the movie.The script wasn't perfect, but everything else bloody was. The music was nice, the actors played very well, the camera work was great (in fact, it is the only movie I've seen after Battlestar Galactica that uses cam motion in a useful, not irritating way) and the story was just wonderful. I changed my mind just now and marked it with a 10, rather than a 9. The movie deserves it.Bottom line: an unlikely combination of Enemy Mine and The Constant Gardener (or at least this is like what it felt to me) that can't possibly not be liked. I highly recommend it.",10,3,7,15 November 2009
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Dragons, wraiths, magic, the whole shebang
","After a lot of character building and exposition, it is time to meet some of the antagonists. The orc's obsession with the dwarfs is now explained as a part of an elaborate evil plan, we finally meet the dragon, which is an intelligent and articulate being, only driven mad by pride and greed. I quite liked the dragon and I wish the character would have been explored more. However, considering this is based on a children's book, any kind of depth in the story is a bonus. We also meet the humans, not some great kingdom, but a mere fisherman's village, far removed from the glory of the original Dale, and run by a corrupt ruler. Sauron makes his appearance, battling all kinds of magic users that seem to appear and disappear from various places as the story demands. We meet the 'not so good' elf lord with a grudge on the dwarfs, as well. Here things start to also go awry with the quality of the storytelling, but the special effects and the increase in tension keep the viewer entertained. It all starts to go more and more over the top, without any reason to. If you are a Tolkien purist or thrive on a believable plot with reasonable characters and events, here is where you will start to scratch your head and wonder where it all went wrong. Still good and fun, though.",8,0,1,25 December 2017
Batman Begins," Great cast, silly movie
","This movie is packed with stars that made cinematography what it is today, all playing their roles as well as they can. The problem is with the roles... You have Michael Caine playing a butler. You have Rutger Hauer playing a company manager that gets beat up at his own game. There is Ken Watanabe playing a few scenes. Linus Roache having a short role where he dies. Morgan Freeman plays a bit larger role, but still secondary to the extreme. Gary Oldman, for crying out loud, is an average looking cop that sits happily in Batman's shadow. Now, I like Christian Bale, I really do. He shows promise as an actor and he is under my attention since Equilibrium and American Psycho. I think he is a good Batman character, as well. However, to play an action hero in the company of such great actors must have felt weird. It certainly did for me, as a viewer.Now, about the movie. It tries to explain in two hours what Batman did since he was a child and until he began his 'career'. It was a difficult task and it was not really attained. The movie had cool effects, but not so cool as the other Batman movies, no matter how silly. The plot was complex, but linearly so and terribly rushed. To mention here the obvious exaggerations would be an exercise in futility; it's a movie based on a comic book.Overall it is hard to explain what went wrong here. It was better than the other Batman films, with the exception of the first, but it failed to capture the 'feel' of the bat. I felt completely disconnected from the characters and story. Maybe, after all, the loss was in the directing.",7,1,5,6 August 2005
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," A lot better than rumoured
","Of the three movies that I've just watched back to back, the starting one is the most decent. The characters are getting built, their relationship and story are getting spun and, considering I was expecting an incredible bore of 'a movie made by Hollywood for money from a book just 50 page long', I quite enjoyed it. The other two films go more and more over the top until they get into Pirates of the Caribbean territory, but this one was OK. Of course, that doesn't really mean anything, since you have to have seen all three movies to form an opinion, but I am just saying that if they went for the same recipe, this could have been a wonderful trilogy.What I felt it was obvious is that it is a true Lord of the Ring film series and that even if they had to improvise a lot, they did it in line with what they did in the LOTR movies.",8,0,2,25 December 2017
Non-Stop," Reasonable action thriller
","I can't believe people saying this film was silly and unbelievable. Have you seen the other movies Liam Neeson did lately? :) Anyway, the story of an air marshal who has to fight against unknown mastermind criminals that are on the plane with him, manipulating people and devices to reach their goals is not as far fetched as decried by many commenters. As any blockbuster movie it does require suspension of disbelief.Liam Neeson plays OK. It is probably a movie fashioned in order for him to star in it, so no problems there. A lot of other actors that we can recognize, mostly from TV, as supporting roles and Julianne Moore in the first role in ages in which she is not completely obnoxious. Yes, there are plot holes. Especially since the quantum of knowledge of the terrorist party was immense in order to pull everything off. But one can overlook them. The tension is maintained well, but it could have been an order of magnitude more just by pressing in the social element. Instead we has Neeson be the primadona for the entire film.Overall, a decent action thriller, with more thriller than action, which feels good to me.",7,0,1,1 July 2014
How to Train Your Dragon 2," The added oomph just tears the film apart
","The first film was fun, adventurous, engaging, even inspiring. The sequel adds more to every aspect: family dynamics and drama, enemies, numbers and size of dragons, deaths, romance... all except the fun, adventure or inspiration.So is it a nicely drawn film? Amazingly so. It's 3D, but a good 3D. What I found very interesting is that the actors did NOT look like their 3D models at all. Just look at the cast. It is also very well voiced and character acted. Where it fails is the storyline, adding a lot of... stuff where none was needed. I wanted more freedom given by flight, interesting uses of dragons, any expansion in the aspects that I liked in the first. I don't care about how many dragons there are and how different they are and other stuff like that.Bottom line: I really wanted to like this film, but the script messed it all up. I rate it average just because it was well done. With a good script this could have been really cool. It wasn't. Instead it seemed like another good animation team abused by producers with Disney like stories. Exactly at what time after they discovered they could ride dragons did the Vikings forget they were Vikings? That is the question I am left with after this film.",7,3,8,27 September 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Hardly a comedy, a little boring, but brilliantly made
","The concept of this film is visual, there is no real story to it. As one of the characters notes, this world has vanished well before someone thought of making a movie about it. The location, the people, the names, they are all scrambled into something completely fictional, but very recognizable. The plot is just a jumble of stuff that just happens sequentially, but is quite inconsequential. The main character is neither of the great actors who are in the cast, but this too real fictional world that none of us are old enough to remember, but all know.Now, if you are not interested in a new perspective, a well done movie, fantastic actors doing fantastic acting, etc, and instead you are interested in a funny story, some action, some moral in the end, then this is not the film for you. At times the movie is downright boring and nothing really happens. The only genre listed in the IMDb fact sheet is comedy, but except the kind of old mute film filming that might elicit some smiles, with accelerated speed and exaggerated movements, nothing in the film seemed comedic to me. It is not a dark comedy, either. Or it is as much as it is a comedy, I guess.Bottom line: once one sees great actors in the cast, there is a desire to see the movie as it must be better than the average film out there. However, when the number of stars in the cast goes above a limit, you know you are in for some artful stuff. This is an art movie, no doubt about it. Watch it for the art of making a movie, since it was, I believe consciously, cleared of any separate meaning.",7,1,2,20 August 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Nothing special at all
","I usually rate average movies with a 7, but this one felt under that bar. Of course, it has to do with expectations. People have told me that this fourth part of the Mission Impossible franchise was better than all the others and I expected something nice. But, since I haven't seen any of the others for reasons of suspension of disbelief, or lack there of, for me it was a big step to just watch this one.Well, fancy action scenes abound, with cool gadgets James Bond would die of envy for, but that defy the laws of physics and common sense. Agents that look beautiful and smart, but they are almost neither. Tom Cruise does a lot to save the film, but the wooden dialogues and silly script overwhelm him.Bottom line: Like an old hooker with lots of expensive makeup, it is just not worth it.",6,3,8,6 April 2012
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Don't expect too much, but better than most
","As a joke, I wanted to start this review by saying it is about the horrors of turning real live chimps into CGI, but as I was watching the film I started to get into the mood and understand what it was about. Fortunately, it was a rather good story with very good rendering, but unfortunately it doesn't even begin to approach the level of social commentary that the original movies had. As such, I would say it's a better than average sci-fi movie, but a less than average Planet of the Apes.To put it bluntly, the apes get smart, they start to resent their treatment at the hands of humans and they react. How? Violently! Hulk smash style. Yes, we can now create the level of CGI that shows hordes of apes moving across the Golden Gate bridge, but then we succumb to the ease of transforming it all into a mindless battle for dominance.If there is something to be taken from this film, it is the way emotions were conveyed from a purely apish perspective. Even if sometimes the apes were made to look and act way too human, most of the time one could expect stuff like that from real animals. I think this is relevant, I think this shows the level of emotional manipulation in Hollywood movies today goes far lower than 'the common denominator', down to the ape in us. And we enjoy it.Bottom line: a block buster that tries to cash in on an idea that most people in the audience aren't even familiar with and a far cry from Carlton Heston's films, but better than most of the crap this year has to offer. Expect nothing spectacular and you will probably enjoy it.",7,1,3,27 November 2011
Avengers: Infinity War," An awesome action movie that makes little sense
","The CGI is great, the acting is good, the action is wonderful, Thanos is really scary, every hero (almost) is here. And yet things make little sense. There are again confusion between forces that have many orders of magnitude between them, there is little strategic or, indeed, tactical logic in this 'war'. I enjoyed the film and I am sure it's going to blow so many people away, but it was so damn pointless. Anyway, the idea is that the movie is just the first of a two parter so my recommendation is to wait until both movies have been released and watch them back to back. I know it's hard, with all the references flying around you and friends wanting to discuss how Star Lord destroyed the universe (oops!), but I think you will enjoy the ending a lot more knowing you will be watching the rest in a few minutes and not next year.",8,1,1,18 August 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A beautiful portrayal of an era in cinema, in a film that has absolutely no story for two hours.
","There are so many famous actors in this one, so many characters, and for two hours of the movie you get them built up, as they act very well in a wonderfully directed panorama of 1960's Hollywood. Then they do nothing. All that build up goes nowhere. There is a WTF Tarantino style ultraviolent scene at the end, but that has absolutely no bearing on the rest of the film and clearly does not provide closure. Tarantino movies are all well made, but some simply suck, as was the case of Death Proof. This film is very similar to that one, only it lasts for 2 hours 40 minutes. If you are the kind of person thinking that the journey is more important than the destination, you might like it, though. It's like 10 for acting, 9 for directing, 10 for the sets and atmo, 1 for story. It's that weird...I don't recommend it.",7,2,3,1 December 2019
Gone Girl," Solid thriller, but it felt like a stretched TV policier
","It is difficult to tell a lot about the plot without spoiling it. The film features Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike, with all other actors merely supporting, in a thrilling story about the private lives of people and the ugliness of the media trying to pry them open, but also mystery and crime.Both Affleck and Pike played well, but it wasn't outside their usual roles and acting range. I felt that the film was a bit too long, it lasts for two hours and a half, but it did need more time in order to show all sides of the story. The problem appeared somewhere in the middle of the film, where it felt like someone wanted to finish it there, but others wanted it continued. The last hour and specifically the ending felt contrived and pushed too far for the sake of artificial drama.Bottom line: I don't get where all the hype is coming from. I've seen similar stories and movies released for TV only. None of the qualities of the film are worth placing it above many other movies and I don't think it deserves the 8.6 IMDb grade. It's not a bad movie, but not a great one either and I find it difficult to recommend it to anyone.",7,1,4,6 January 2015
Mr. Nobody," Will I live for a long time? No, but it will seem that you do
","The first thing I have to say is that it has a very nice soundtrack. The second is that people acted relatively well and that the production values were really good. That being said, I can't remember a movie that made me want to fast forward so much as this one. It lasts for two hours and a half, but it feels like it took a whole day to watch it.The plot is of a guy living a lot of possible versions of his life, all jumbled together so that you can't even understand one. Is he remembering stuff as he is dying, sometime in the future? Is everything a figment of the imagination of a nine year old? Is any of it real? Which girl is he really ending up with: the perfect Juno Temple that turns into Diane Kruger when she's older but that can't seem to sync her life to his, the crazy blonde or the perfectly normal Asian girl who loves him completely and bores him to death? One thing is certain, he will always be a little misogynistic in his own head! Ha Ha Ha (imagine a really really old man laughing like that, just so that you understand it is not funny)In the end, it reminded me of that joke where the doctor recommends no cigars, no alcohol, no sugar, no sex, no danger, etc in order to live a long life. This film is really really really long. And boring.",6,1,8,4 January 2015
Django Unchained," Successful reinvention of Django
","It was funny when Jamie Foxx explained to Franco Nero that 'the D is silent', a tip of the hat to the original Django from 1966. The plot is completely different, though, a sort of origin story maybe, that makes Django a liberated black slave trying to free his wife with the help of a German bounty hunter.Here Tarantino again teams up with Christoph Waltz, the guy who did the best role by far in Inglorious Bastards. For those familiar with Tarantino, expect a lot of flamboyant dialogue followed by gun shots. This could be one of the best films lately, mainly because it is not that 'Tarantined'. It almost feels like a normal movie if it weren't for all the talking and seemingly inadvertent humour.Bottom line: this here is a Western, no doubt about it. With Tarantino's unmistakable style added for fun and a black guy as the hero. The stellar cast helps as well: Jamie Foxx, Leo di Caprio, Samuel L. Jackson (in a role that only he could have possibly carried out that well) and, of course, Tarantino as a cameo in the smallest role possible. Kudos to me for recognizing James Remar in both his roles and always expecting to be a connection between the two characters. But there was not.",8,3,9,12 January 2013
Get Out," Whatever you do, do not watch the trailers or read the reviews before you see it
","There was enormous hype surrounding this film, which is the main reason I watched it, but also the main reason why I felt uncomfortable watching it for a long time before that. If you are reading this, it's probably too late to not watch the trailer or read the commentaries on it, but I am warning you anyway. Because it is a racially loaded film, there are a lot of people who focus on that for some reason. Also, while I gave it a full ten stars, this is compared to other thrillers, not movies in general. That said, the film is a slow paced thriller. Things start cool, then they get weirder and weirder until the final climax. The story is ingenious, but nothing you haven't seen before in such movies. What I found interesting was the acting, the direction and the script, so all the qualities that I enjoy in a movie. Jordan Peele obviously did a good job, but Daniel Kaluuya (my man) hit all the right notes. The hallmark of a good thriller (perhaps of any genre) is that it has a main character that you can relate to, and 'Chris Washington' did all the things I believe a normal person would do in that situation. What this film did not have: jump scares (well, they had one, but it was at the beginning and I can forgive it), group of friends building fear off each other, people that behave dumb, hysterical or malevolent just to make the story less boring, a predictable script. Well, it was kind of predictable, but I'd read the reviews, hence my warning. The story also lends itself to nice prequels and even sequels, but I think it said what it was set to say. I also liked that they didn't try to explain it too much: stuff just happens and it's the point of view of the lead character that takes precedence over everything else, while the role of the viewer is to interpret it as they see fit. What could have gone better: editing out the scene at the beginning with the other black guy.  Bottom line: a nail-biting success. Worth watching. Also, check out the alternate ending of the movie, that is roaming the Internet out there.",10,22,44,24 January 2018
Drive," It's always the quiet ones
","Drive has the feel of an 80's movie, with its moody soundtrack and heist oriented story, only without the crazy hair. Ryan Gosling plays the role of a quiet young man who appears to be a genius behind the wheel and sometimes is the getaway driver for different undesirables.If you think this is the same plot as The Transporter, then you are right, only with a realistic and atmospheric screenplay and soundtrack. The main character is not a superhero, he doesn't do stunts (I mean he does do stunts, for Hollywood movies, but that's his job) while being a rather decent guy. He falls for Carey Mulligan (who can blame him?) befriends her child and even her husband, then it all goes bust.Bottom line: a very beautiful film, quiet, understated, going for the art, not really the story. At the end of the film you get a little pause, just good enough to make you wonder how you would like the film to end and if it would matter. And the answer is no, it wouldn't, as the focus and value of the film is in the acting and realization of the film, not the plot. And how weird it is to see myself write that.",8,1,7,17 August 2012
Aladdin," Good direction and acting, but it felt a bit off. Plus, a musical.
","The story was the bare bone Aladdin: thief and princess fall in love, evil vizier, placeholder sultan, funny monkey and evil parrot. Lots of bling, stupid songs and dance, the end. It must be an American and Indian thing to sing and dance during a movie and think it brings something positive to it. For me it just made it all silly. No depth of story, character, nothing to learn from it, a waste of the talents of the actors and the director, which clearly did a good job. Also, Will Smith must hate blue face paint, because all of his genie routine was really really really bad face CGI.",7,0,2,12 October 2019
2012," Worse than I had imagined
","I heard about the movie later than most because I don't watch TV so much. When I did it was something like 'hey, did you hear about that movie that comes out this winter with the end of the world?'. So, naturally, I thought the worst of the film itself. Then I heard about Roland Emmerich directing it and started to have hopes. Then the first reviews from friends came out. I was told it was nothing else than the total destruction of the Earth, but not much else. Well, that should be fun.Now my subjective view on the matter: they hired some graphics engineers and told them to destroy the planet. Engineers, given their nature, happily obliged. Meanwhile, the director was looking for actors that are cheap enough, but known to all, so that people actually notice the scenes they are in. After the graphics guys did it, they shot the actors around the scenes and tried to give the film a story. And failed. But who cares about the story anyway? So they shipped it. (well, it's a pun in there, but you have to see the movie to get it).Le me recap. Neutrinos mutate! they come from the Sun! they interact with matter! so the Earth crust crumbles worse than in Neverending Story under the assault of the Nothing (here is the part you want to see), while cars honk and subways continue to function (meh, engineers). In the end the people of the Earth (the rich ones) regain their humanity and help a bunch of other stranded rich guys while the world ends. Why didn't they just make it a game? Or an animation movie? What was the purpose of all that pseudo scientific mambo jumbo?Bottom line: watch it with a lot of popcorn and sickly sweet juice, preferably with some mutated neutrinos. They'll get the joke.",6,0,1,26 December 2009
The Number 23," A very nice psychothriller
","I had to get rid of my wife before watching this film as she totally refused to watch a Jim Carrey film. I can understand her reluctance to watch a movie she sees as another series of weird faces and toilet humour like The Mask or Ace Ventura.But no, this movie is nothing like that. I always thought Jim Carrey has it in him to be a great actor. I don't know if this particular movie is a masterpiece of his, but he plays well and fits the character as a glove. You can associate this film with the Truman Show, I guess.It is hard to talk about the movie without spoiling things. The obsession with the number 23 is not the bulk of the film, though, it's just a premise for a smart, intelligent script. The movie is also a combination of noir-detective film and psychological thriller.Bottom line: way under-marked film on IMDb, without being a great movie, it is a good one, one that deserves recognition for a smart, unpredictable story and good acting.",8,1,2,28 July 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Bad movie even by X-standards
","OK, this is (again!) a movie based on a comic. The third part. How good can one be, anyway? But it was worse. I've watched the X-men animated series and I enjoyed them, I liked even the 'young x-men' crap. So I should be relatively unbiased, yet I feel I was cheated! this movie completely sucked!Not only the mutant powers are now so powerful that the existence of humans as a species is already useless, but the reasons for their actions are really dumb. Magneto must be the worst strategist since general Custer, Xavier dies stupidly, Cyclops dies stupidly, Wolverine doesn't die, (again!), and the whole thing goes round a cure for mutantness, which in the comic was a cover for the experiments of Apocalypse. Nothing so interesting in X-Men 3 - The Can't Stand.Conclusion: even the special effects are dumb. Expensive and good looking, but purposeless. Stupid, stupid movie. Let me decrease the Vote mark again.",5,0,1,30 May 2006
The Mist," Human vs. Alien Nature - which is uglier?
","A perfect movie. That is all I can say. It had all I would have wanted in a movie and even something more. I am not really a fan of Stephen King and I have to admit when I heard of this movie I mistook it with a remake of The Fog, which was not such a great story. Boy was I wrong.The story takes place during an alien infestation, but that is something that I would call a detail, although the aliens are extremely well rendered; it is character driven to the extreme, showing more than anything else the way people (re)act during a crisis. Stephen King has a very pessimistic view of the subject and I sadly but wholeheartedly agree. Very well acted, good cast, nice soundtrack, superb plot and very good production values.Since I can't find anything wrong with the movie, I conclude this by thanking Frank Darabont for a great movie and I strongly suggest you to see it, whether horror or sci-fi fans or not. Also, I admire the courage it took to actually make the movie as it was done, which I believe could have been done more commercial by spoiling the plot completely and I am so glad Garabont did not do that.",10,2,5,1 November 2009
Stardust," Beautiful fairy tale with a tang of cinema humour
","No, the film is not a comedy, more of a darker fairy tale, but there are certain scenes that clearly point to other movies. For example Claire Danes and Charlie Cox standing on the prow of the air ship as it hits the water. It must have been hard for the actors not to raise their arms. Also when Michelle Pfeiffer used a voodoo doll; very Eastwick of her.The story is almost standard: you get the prince(s), the princess, the witches, the hero, the evil king, the pirate... all the tarot cards are there. The effects are good without being terribly flashy, the actors seem to have been chosen for their match to the role rather than using Hollywood stars (pun intended) to bring people in the cinemas.However, what makes this film good is that it puts the story in the foreground and the actors, soundtrack, special effects and whatnot remain where they are supposed to: as props for telling it.Bottom line: good fairy tale, both for children and adults, and a very well done film.",8,2,2,2 January 2008
I Am Legend," The Quiet Earth meets 28 Days Later
","Will Smith is the only American left alive in Manhattan. Traffic jams and Wall Street are a thing of the past. It wasn't even the terrorists, it was a genetically engineered virus that ran amok. What it does is kill all people, unless it turns them into super strength and super speed zombies.The guy is also a doctor, trying to research a cure for the virus. It starts exactly like The Quiet Earth and at first I thought it was a remake. Then the zombies from 28 Days Later decide to mate with the ones in Resident Evil and ruin what could have been a beautiful ending to the human race. But then something horrible happens: the zombies kill Will Smith's dog! It all goes downhill from there and, unfortunately, the human race survives. But would you really want to survive a world without Will Smith?Bottom line: great special effects, Will Smith plays great, but the story doesn't really say anything. And taking into consideration that a sequel is planned in 2010 and about three video games in between, it all seems more like a money franchise than an honest attempt to make a movie that does say anything. It was a pretty good SF-horror, without being too smart or too stupid.",7,1,4,23 January 2008
The Bourne Legacy," Jason Bourne is turning in his grave
","Jason Bourne is dead and buried. Robert Ludlum wrote three books about him and that was it. Hollywood took the books and turned them into movies that are remotely similar to the books, but the merit was more Matt Damon's than anyone else's, in my opinion.Fast forward to the Legacy. It is a film that has nothing to do with Bourne other than a hook to start the story. The details and complexities that transpired into the Bourne scripts from the books were non existent in this film. The oversimplified plot finds a rather plain secret agent from 'yet another' government secret program running for his life together with Rachel Weisz.While I like Jeremy Renner and I think he can do a lot in the movie business, his role was ridiculously unidimensional. Rachel Weisz's role was not much better, but was actually the more complex in the film and she played it well. The other stars in the cast could have been any number of actors, since their acting skills were not required in their small and cardboard roles.Bottom line: I have to give kudos to the trailer. It didn't give up anything about Renner's character or the general plot, therefore enabling the belief that the film has anything to do with Jason Bourne. It has earned a lot of money to undeserving people. Alas, the legacy of Robert Ludlum will not be found in movies, especially Hollywood ones, so go reread the Bourne books and skip this failure of a film.As a separate point, there is a Bourne Legacy book, the first in a series of seven, written by Eric Van Lustbader. They have nothing to do with this film.",6,2,8,2 December 2012
Kick-Ass," Nice concept, but average after that
","I expected a silly super hero movie, although I knew from the extremely well done publicity that it was a little different from that. Good job marketing team! However, besides the idea of a geeky Jewish kid becoming a silly costumed defender of justice for no apparent reason, the rest was your average teenage hero movie.That doesn't mean it didn't deliver the kick ass action, the emotional content and a little of that Peter and Mary-Jane thing, because it did. If you take Spiderman, remove his powers, make him even geekier (yes, it is possible) and then add a slightly demented Batman and his daughter in the movie as a secondary character, you get Kick Ass.The ending was a little disappointing, as well. If you beat the drums about the powerless every day kid super hero, don't create a ridiculous action scene at the end that makes no sense tactically, anyway.Bottom line: good for a few laughs, but don't take it seriously.",8,0,8,12 May 2010
Unknown," Liam Neeson kicks ass and is too cool to chew bubblegum
","Unknown is a pretty captivating action thriller staring Liam Neeson. The premise is quite fantastic, but until the end, when we realize what has happened, it is quite interesting. Follow Dr. Martin Harris as he runs against the clock to find out who stole his identity.The movie is not as action packed as Taken, for instance, leaving time to develop the characters and the plot. I can imagine this would have been a film for Harrison Ford, if done a decade or more ago.In all, I found the movie involving, but not very memorable. The ending solves all mysteries and feels a bit rushed, so that is probably what drags down an otherwise above average film.",7,2,3,29 December 2012
Call Me by Your Name," A lot of idylic romance, but that's about it
","1980's Lombardia, in a summer in which there is no rain, where everything is just high philosophy, swimming in lakes and reading in the sun on an Italian mansion, two people fall in love. The acting is good, the script is subtle, the love story is expressed very well, the scenery is amazing. It's just that there is no story other than the romance. Everything is perfect, including the ending. A perfect summer romance with no ups or downs, no extra context, just love. My wife loved the film, I was trying very hard not to fall asleep.Bottom line: You probably have to be in the mood to enjoy the film. I didn't think the gay angle was significant in any way. Had it been between a man and a woman, I would have felt similarly bored.",8,2,4,2 March 2018
Gran Torino," Clint Eastwood as a grumpy old man. What a shock!
","I started watching the movie with great expectations, which is probably the reason why I was slightly disappointed with it. Yeah, Clint Eastwood plays a good role, but how could he not? What remains is the story itself and it was both interesting and profoundly stupid.We meet this old guy, a pillar of faith in his own preconceptions, suddenly evolving under the pressure of Asian neighbors? He then acts all high and mighty only to prove that people can get hurt that way. In the end he does the right thing... sort of.The point I am making is that the plot itself, while it might seem realistic enough, did not make me empathize with any of the characters nor did it teach me something useful about the world. In the end, it felt like a pointless movie.",7,0,4,6 February 2010
The Hurt Locker," A Really cool film
","It is not often I stumble upon a movie that is so well thought out as this one. Initially I thought I would not watch it, being about Iraq I had expected a lot of bull, even joked about how cool it would be to make a movie about a German squad having to live amongst the French, not knowing whether they are foe or not. However, this movie was great, following the lives of people in a bomb squad in Iraq, as they are worming their way through the 40 days of company rotation left.There are a lot of good things in this film. One of them is the casting. At least three well known actors that have accepted playing in the movie, but their roles are only a few minutes long, more like cameos. This solves the problem of knowing exactly who lives and who dies just by looking up their IMDb rating. Another is that the characters in the film are all flawed in some way. They are not the perfect good guys, so boringly unrealistic in many movies of the genre.But what I thought was most important of all, is the capturing of the feeling of the place, without gluing the audience to a single character to which to identify. It is the same thing that made me love Strange Days, also directed by Kathryn Bigelow. This movie is great because it feels like a book and a precious few films manage to achieve this feat.",9,2,8,27 September 2009
X-Men: Apocalypse," Better, bigger and cut for kids
","I didn't expect much and I didn't get much. As a sci-fi movie it was good; as an X-men movie it felt barely average. Typical villain, the usual back and forth between mutants switching from one side to another, the Stan Lee cameo, the end credits scene. In the end, it didn't feel like anything.That was its largest flaw: with all the scenes of personal loss, mental torture, mass killing, shootings and evisceration I didn't feel one damn thing. Personal loss was used as a generic token to change someone's behavior in a way that made no sense, the torture and the killing were carefully doctored to show almost no blood and no people that one might feel connected to in any way. Surely we are all used to faceless soldiers dying in droves and even if you know rationally that the New York bridge and the Sydney opera and the entire city of Cairo were full of people, you don't see any bodies, any suffering and the movie makes sure you don't care.What was the purpose of it all, then, if all your efforts are pushed into CGI and making your audience not care? I know it's Marvel fatigue, but at the same time the movie was simply bland. And not by accident, but on purpose. Enjoy your two hours of heroic clich√©s and expensive special effects and, while you think of the plot and the characters, imagine you are watching the cartoon. It will help.",7,3,7,24 July 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," What a flop!
","I've read some of the reviews for the movie at IMDb and I am absolutely convinced that a lot of them are paid for. There are so many things wrong with this film that I cannot imagine someone liking it, not to mention calling it 'amazing' and 'electrifying'.The problems start from the very first scenes. You have some thugs stealing nuclear material from an armored truck, all the while driving in a huge tow truck that smashes through everything: police cars, normal cars, buses, you name it. What does Spidey do? He comes swinging and starts talking with the guy, making jokes all the while. Then we spend a quarter of a movie seeing him trying to push away the woman that he loves because she wants her safe, then coming back because he loves her too much. Meanwhile, all the people that he cares about or that he saves their lives seem to turn to pointless villains that want to kill him.Are the special effects nice, then? They start off nice enough, but then they go so far into CGI land that it all feels like a Road Runner cartoon. Is the acting good? No! All the dialogues are so bad that you can actually see actors cringing while saying them. Action scenes? CGI overload. Logic? nonexistent. Science? Raped repeatedly. Moral of the story? Not there. There is no point in anything anyone does in the movie. They don't even have a post credits scene.Bottom line: I like superhero and comic book fantasies and I think I can get in the spirit of things quite easily. After all, I watched every Spiderman movie so far, and they are all about a guy in pajamas swinging from building to build (when he is not whining - or dancing). I also realize that the concept itself is both difficult to promote in a modern world and to put in a live action film (that is why so many of them turn into CGI cartoons most of the time). However this film I couldn't not hate it. It is so bad in so many ways that I feel anger for having watched it. It's how I imagined the Mutant Teenage Ninja Turtles movie to be when I decided not to watch it. I shudder at the thought that it might be worse. Do. Not. Watch. This. Filth.",5,3,8,30 August 2014
Ex Machina," Artificial Intelligence in slow motion
","The movie is all about defining Artificial Intelligence. It starts with a computer nerd brought down to the isolated mansion of the owner of a Google like company to test if a robot exhibits true intelligence and self awareness. But what does that really mean? Ex Machina explores exactly this question.While the acting and direction was top notch, I have to warn you that this film is slow as hell. I don't mean that in a 'oh, there are no action scenes' way. I mean it is really, artistically, excruciatingly, Solaris-like slow. The film lasts for 'just' 100 minutes, but it feels like it's a three hour movie.The exploration of the AI subject is interesting, realistic and ironic, in a certain way. If you think about it, all of the actions and motivations of the actors are hard to judge until the very end, when you realize there is really no bad guy and everything just went in a perfectly logical and predictable manner, given all information. You get that information at the end, which makes it worthwhile to have lasted through the entire play-like, four actors film.Bottom line: this is a movie that must be seen, must be endured, because it asks the correct questions and reveals the logical answers. However, the slow pace and the limited interaction between the four actors (one of them is a mute girl) makes it hard to enjoy it on an emotional level.",8,4,12,16 May 2015
The Illusionist," Surprisingly good
","The movie itself is about illusion and, true to its subject, it uses slight of hand to tell an interesting and thrilling story while in the same time dazzling us with the socio-political situation of the time. In the end, we see that was only the dust in the eye.I expected good acting from Edward Norton, as I expected a good script. This guy seems to accept only interesting stories to play in, and I applaud him for it. Jessica Biel plays the beautiful, yes stylish lady, in a role in which I wouldn't have easily placed her in. But she performs beautifully. Rufus Sewell is again cast in the role of a violent frustrated man. The big surprise came from Paul Giamatti, playing a rather powerful role as opposed to the usual insecure and weird guy he usually plays. He is also the narrator of the story and the main point of view. He did very nice, making this a good movie as much, if not more, as Edward Norton.Bottom line: a definitely must see movie. As it happens with intelligent, well done movies, I've stumbled only accidentally over it and I didn't regret it.",8,2,4,30 December 2006
Grudge Match," Typical competitive sport thing, age 60
","The movie was exactly what I expected, perhaps with the exception of Kim Basinger who looks smoking hot at an age when most women need hearing aids and false teeth. You have these two old boxers who have had a grudge for 30 years, since they had to fight each other, but the fight was canceled. The film is all about they getting over it via a box match. The fact that they did that after 30 years (time in which neither really had a life) makes it spicier, but basically, that's just the sprinkling on the cake.I can't say that I got inspired by the movie or anything, but it felt more real than many of the genre, probably because of all the history of the characters making them deeper, meatier. Most movies of this kind use cardboard roles that mean nothing to anyone, like the obe played by Kevin Hart. Even Kim Basinger's role was a typical clich√©, the woman that has always loved a man, waiting for him no matter how boneheaded he is.Bottom line: aside the old actors, this was a typical sports match thing. They train, they say their piece, they fight. Also, except some marketing lines about iPads and some 'going viral' lines, this could have just as well been a 70's movie. Robert de Niro was a strange casting for a boxer, but he finally played a role I liked him in since... forever. And Sly Stallone brings a lot more melancholy in this film than in any of the Expendables.",7,2,2,27 July 2014
Pawn Sacrifice," Explains Fischer, but takes some liberties
","Tobey Maguire is great in this film. No matter what qualms one might have, you absolutely got that at least. The movie also manages to do something rather difficult: make real chess look interesting and have dramatic tension. The intensity of the story is exacerbated by the gravity of Fischer's mental condition. Having personal experience with afflicted people, I can tell you that if you don't want to see crazy people you should avoid this film.The interesting thing is that, even if I like chess and I am all for strong performances, I couldn't really enjoy the film. I don't think it is a bad movie, quite the opposite, and probably my feelings are getting in the way of correctly reviewing the film, but I felt like pausing the film or even going on fast forward at times. I wanted to know what happened, but I didn't want to go through it.Bottom line: it was difficult to me to see a brilliant man devolve mentally and hurting everyone around him and himself. That is what the movie is really about. Having it be about a real person and a genius in a sport I like is just the icing on the cake. Fantastic acting, though, from Tobey Maguire, who manages to channel Fischer, even if he looks nowhere near like the real man.",8,1,3,18 March 2016
Wimbledon," Unexpectedly good romance/sport movie.
","Well, first of all it's a British movie. It couldn't have been completely bad, I mean, they have humour. It did smell a little of Notting Hill and other UK romantic comedies that put together a charming Englishman and an American starlet, but it was all original. As original as a sports movie can be, of course. There is always the tension of the 'big championship' mixed with the tension of the romantic relationship and sprinkled with tension relaxing humour. Play those buttons right and you've got the instant orgasm.But it wasn't all recipe. There were some very inventive shots of the tennis ball and some good jokes. They didn't overdo it, either, so it wasn't something you keep laughing at. James McAvoy played a ridiculously small part, while Kirsten Dunst seemed awake the entire course of the film. No partially fainted declarations of love in a slow almost inaudible voice in this movie. Sam Neil, an actor that I like, despite some poor choices in films he chose to play in, plays her slightly controlling dad who comes through in the end.Paul Bettany has it going on. He has that lovely accent, good looks and, from what I have seen in his movies, a very large emotional range that he can easily express. I am looking forward to more of his films.Bottom line: good to watch with the girl, it contains nothing spectacular or some amazing twist, but it is a decent easy going romantic sports movie that makes almost no mistakes.",7,1,1,20 August 2006
Magic Mike XXL," Magic Mike 2000
","I really enjoyed the first Magic Mike movie. It made me feel like I understand what women want, made me learn interesting things and Channing Tatum was excellent, plus the film had an actual story, with character development. This version is just the pumped up, former celebrities filled, more diverse, less Miked road trip version of the film. It was quite a disappointment. Not even Amber Heard's beautiful presence could save it.The premise is that the band is splitting up and they want to go for one last 'stripper conference'. Matthew McConaughey is gone, Steven Soderbergh is gone, enter black people and beloved, yet tired (and less paid) celebrities like Jada Pinkett Smith, Andie MacDowell and Elizabeth Banks. The feeling that you understand the characters is gone, replaced by 'explanatory dialogues' of why they are like healers and how they listen and understand. God damn it, every word I am writing in this review lowers my rating more and more. It is like a sequel constructed by studio lawyers with the help of focus groups made of mentally challenged people.The worst crime of this film, though, was that it wasn't about Magic Mike at all and had shitty choreography to boot. Channing Tatum's character joins the party as an outsider, while the focus is on everybody and everything else, while they are driving to the convention, meeting all kind of folks and giving occasional performances that seem like they are setting up the great one at the end of the movie. A performance which really sucked.Bottom line: I wonder if even women will like this film.",5,0,2,29 August 2015
Hidden Figures," Oscar bait about racism in the '60s, based on real people
","The movie is based on a book, but both were released in about the same time, so who can know for sure. It is the story of three very smart African-American women who got ahead at NASA, despite habitual and wide spread racism. It's not about the Moon shot, but the period right before, when Russians were still beating Americans in space and they were all frustrated about it, so the working conditions were tough.The actors played very well and the story is based on real people at NASA. I doubt that they could have gotten away with too much dramatization when real people are involved, right? Yet considering the only of the three women who is still alive is 98 and that they went with the ole Oscar bait formula, I have my doubts. You know, take well known but faded actors and make them do character play, use foreshadowing for the most impactful moments in the movie, link the storyline not only to the American dream (both in space and in terms of getting out from under racism), but also with short jabs at 'the American soul' and short references to Jews in Nazi Germany (but not on using Wernher von Braun for their rockets, of course).It was a good movie, but the feel of it was off. It felt like the black women in this film had a modern mentality and reactions, rather than what I imagine would have been the negro state of mind in a country where toilets and bus seats were separated by color. But I haven't lived there and then and I may be wrong. Also the knight in shining armor that was played by Kevin Costner was so over the top that it just felt fake. Poor Jim Parsons was stuck playing a nasty racist bureaucrat, Kirsten Dunst was the nice but conservative lady... it was just too cardboard.Bottom line: with less agenda and more science and inspiration it could have been great.",8,1,6,19 February 2017
Pi," A bunch of numerical nonsense drive a nut nuttier
","This is a black and white movie. It does not serve any real purpose and it happens at a time where there are a lot of movies filmed in black and white, so it's not even original.I admit that I had read the IMDb comments before seeing this film and I expected so much more, but still, there is almost nothing there. A mathematician is working on a computer that would predict market fluctuations and he gets involved with a greedy Condoleeza Rice look-a-like and a bunch of insane rabbis that all somehow know about him and have faith that he found or at least he will find 'the number'. Since we all know the answer is 42, it does seem silly :) No, seriously, there is a number that predicts market fluctuations, the spiral shape of snails and, oh yeah, it's the Hebrew name for god. Somehow, after watching this entire movie, I expected a very intelligent climax, something that will blow me away. It never came. The guy just finds out the part of the brain responsible for this obsession of his and puts a power drill through it. He finds happiness in ignorance. It's like Neo taking the other pill in Matrix.Conclusion: you may like it, but then you must be smarter than I am. I felt like a complete idiot at the end of the movie. Either I didn't get it, or I just lost 84 minutes of my life with a completely nonsensical film. Either way I lose.",5,1,3,4 June 2005
Children of Men," Pretty good film
","I wanted to see this movie because of Clive Owen and was afraid to because of Julianne Moore. Thankfully, she dies early in the film. Her short appearance and the idea that humans might one day stop having children for no apparent reason were the flaws of this film, other than that, it was pretty well done. It even had lines spoken in Romanian :)The depicted world was far too detailed to be a script only thing. Of course, the movie is based on a book. The actors play very well, the tension keeps up during the entire movie and I personally would have removed the last 5 minutes of the film, but that's just as well.It is a sci-fi movie only in name. Its premise is that there haven't been any human births for 18 years and suddenly a pregnant woman appears. If you ignore that, it is all a chase film in a world dreamed by Bush. Corrupt government on one side, terrorists on the other and all the smart and compassionate people in the middle.Bottom line: it was very well done, dark but not overly dramatic, desperate but not hysterical, heroic but not explosive. I mean, I can hardly believe Clive Owen went by all those discarded weapons and didn't pick one, didn't kill anyone, didn't even properly punch a guy. The only real fight scene he was in, he was saved by the Romanian woman :) The atmosphere was great and for that I mark it high. You want to watch this.",8,2,3,21 March 2007
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Good thriller movie
","The feel of the movie is similar to that of the first 'Les rivi√®res pourpres' film. Same high class isolated community, a mystery and some people investigating it. Based on the first book in the Millennium trilogy, written by Stieg Larsson, it follows an investigative reporter and a girl hacker trying to find the killer in a 40 years old murder.The plot is complex and each character has their own definite personality and story. The actors are playing well, too, even the ones in secondary roles, which adds to the overall atmosphere. I am not a big fan of the mystery thriller, but I enjoy the occasional well done film and this is clearly one of those. Given that the movie will be remade by the Americans, with actors like Daniel Craig and Carey Mulligan, other people have thought the same as me. I would still recommend seeing the Swedish version first, though.Bottom line: really good mystery thriller, the only one in the trilogy that can be watched standalone, I think. The other two don't bother presenting the characters and are obvious continuations of the same story. There will be a US remake in 2012, but I say you should not wait for it and watch the Swedish version.",9,2,5,26 June 2010
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," A dinosaur movie
","This film is an important lesson in history, brought to us by George Clooney, who directed the movie and co-wrote the script. There was a dark period in the US history, a time when people were bullied and persecuted for alleged communist sympathies. It is known as the McCarthy era, and people are just about to forget all its lessons, because that's what people do, they routinely lose the relevance of any historical event that is more than 50 years old.But the film is more than this. It is also a window into the past of television, the way it started, with journalistic integrity, lack of censorship from the 'corporate branches' and reporters that knew and used words most US citizens think are French. The movie starts and ends with a speech that warns about the misuse and/or abandonment of the media.The movie is shot in black and white, I have no particular sympathy for this method of depicting past events, I think that the world was not black and white back then as it is not 2D today. The cast is full of good actors and George Clooney plays a rather secondary role, leaving the lead to David Strathairn, who does a great role.Now, if you put aside the important messages in the film you don't leave much. The acting is good, the script is informative, but the atmosphere is difficult to grasp, intellectual. People who knew about the McCarthy period and how journalism should be done are the ones who will love this movie, while the people who need to know what this movie explains will probably switch the channel or fall asleep during watching.In the end, it is hard for anyone to be on the side of McCarthy now, yet the parallels to todays US political reign are obvious enough. One can see another message, rather a prediction, that Bush, like McCarthy, will eat himself up, will disappear as a dark footnote in the history books, only to be remembered as the guy who played fear and sang freedom.That's why I named my comment a dinosaur movie. It's about people that you will not find in television now, it's about people that became extinct, yet towered over anything making a news report today. It is also about dinosaur politics, fast acting, smashing and disturbing in result, doomed to extinction from starvation.",7,0,1,5 June 2006
Big Hero 6," How to train your robot
","I cannot say that the movie was not nice. The animation was good and the feelings expressed in it were what kids probably need. However, the story was a melange of various concepts, just like the name of the fictional city the plot is supposed to take place in: San Fransokyo. It's How To Train Your Dragon with robots.In this world where 14 year olds can use the resources of a single mother/aunt to build plane like flying robots, microrobots that can link with each other and perform whatever task the mind of their controller can think of, Hiro (said 14 year old) has to impress a teacher in order to get into a robotics university. Things go well until his brother dies, which pushes the little kid into a quest for justice and revenge. A lot of wondrous 3D graphics later, it all just comes into place.I cannot imagine why this mediocre film with a predictable story and really unlikable characters has the high rating it has on IMDb. For me it wasn't a failure, but it was a severe disappointment. There was absolutely nothing in the movie that was above average.",7,0,10,10 April 2015
Grave of the Fireflies," I can hardly see through the tears. Great drama anime.
","This is a war time story and, while it has a slow pace, it couldn't have been told any other way. It's like a knife being slowly inserted and twisted in the wound.Everything begins with a 'La Vitta e Bella' atmosphere: mother dead, father at war, brother and little sister going to a distant relative, brother sheltering the sister from the realities of war as much as possible. But the end of the film (which again, doesn't come abruptly, but gradually) is nothing like happy.This has no action scenes, no fight or physical violence scenes, no sci-fi and no fiction. It's an anime harsh reality that makes you cry your eyes off at the end of the movie. The movie is great, it's a must see for anime lovers or anybody else.I recommend to see again the start of the film after you have seen the whole movie.",9,3,4,11 June 2005
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Deus ex machina overuse and a bad script made even more painful by good acting and a lot of wasted potential
","What I found incredibly professional was how serious and well everybody acted in what was clearly a joke of a story, yet instead of phoning it in, every actor did great. Like any force user turned towards the dark side, I felt conflicted, sitting there in the theater, admiring the technical work of CGI artists, actors, set designers and so on, while being taken for a complete retarded idiot by whoever wrote the story. Scene after bad scene, the heroes are stuck in impossible situations, only to get out again and again by means of tricks that make no sense with heroic music on the background. Either an all present, invisible and intelligent robot or a cute yet proud animal or some technology that could have been used three scenes ago with devastating results but for some reason no one thought of it, but at every step something that is no merit of the characters involved had to save them in order to further the stupid plot. And what hurt even more is that in this jumbled mess of childish storytelling, there was a beacon of light, a moment that could have turned the whole franchise towards a better side, one that was neither good nor bad, neither white nor black, but something new, a fresh idea that could have made Star Wars into a greater work and taken full advantage of the talent already employed. In this scene that I don't want to spoil, if every character in it were acting as they were built for several movies and a half, it would have revolutionized Star Wars and made me forgive all the sins of this film. But no, they went completely out of character and it just went downward from there, with a final act that was even more deus ex machinas, saving animals, mysterious blind spots for the enemies that acted like frustrated four year old children, the high contrast good vs evil crap and a return to a tired and really bad canon. I swear, all it lacked to be a complete travesty were a flock of eagles coming out from nowhere and saving the stranded heroes. Like the bland black and white story the film portrays, it is also made of starkly bad versus good elements, but I am afraid in the end it leans heavily towards the dark side.",6,9,17,26 December 2017
Brave," Animated film about family values... and bears
","As expected of Pixar, the animation is top notch. The story, even if fairy talish and simplistic and typical Disney, is still a good one. Add Scottish accents and natural witchcraft and you get a cautionary tale of pride and family love.Now, the film is not perfect, far from it. The plot is simple, the silliness factor is through the roof and most characters are presented as lovable idiots. But I had fun watching Brave. It is made for kids and it shows, but as long as they've got their target audience right and the content to prove it, it's all good.Bottom line: not the best of Pixar's productions, but certainly a nice one.",7,0,1,28 December 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," As I suspected, that raccoon makes it all worthwhile
","As most comic book movies and blockbusters in general, this film is a classic fantasy with some modern mambo-jumbo thrown in instead of magic. But at the same time it is much more a character driven story than most sci-fi action movies I've seen in a while. That's a good thing!Now, I have no idea what the comics were like, I went to see the film because it was 3D and it has a rad raccoon in it! Yeah, I am that shallow. But even if some of the characters were cardboard, like the unfortunate case of Karen Gillan's, most of them had depth and humor. One thing you should NOT do, and that is buy into the antihero hype. Every time Hollywood tries to sell you anti-heroes they just mean regular heroes that are not spotless boyscouts to begin with.As expected, the raccoon was really nice, but not in a cartoonish way, but in an angry frustrated creature that had attachment to only his trusted friend Groot. Vin Diesel played Groot, but there was no reason to do that. The character was completely animated and had no real dialogue. Why hire a known actor for that? One of the other interesting characters was Bautista's. He is the classic 'Barbarian', but has a lot of emotional depth.Bottom line: unexpectedly good, even for a mainstream genre movie. Don't expect miracles, but it is worth seeing.",8,1,6,17 September 2014
Evil Dead," Not as campy as the first, but mostly the same plot. No humour, though.
","Some of us remember The Evil Dead fondly because of Bruce Campbell's shenanigans and especially the funny persona that was created for parts two and three. The first part, the original, was only a campy horror, with lots of fake blood and mustard thrown around and some obnoxious acting. As such, this film is a pretty straightforward remake, with a slightly different plot, death order and survivor. It lacks any hint of campiness or humour, though, or that manic craziness that Campbell portrayed, which might upset people.For me, though, The Evil Dead was the first horror I've watched, aged 6, and I had nightmares over it for a few days afterwards. I was way too young to understand it and at the time it was a pretty horror experience. The feeling for the 2013 remake was completely different. Not only did I know what was going to happen, but films like this have been done since... well... at least 1981; to death, pardon the pun.Also I have to say that The Cabin in the Woods spoiled any chance of me 'feeling it'. I kept waiting for Richard Jenkins to appear, LOL. And all the characters are really unlikeable, and some over the top scenes really broke any spell that might have gripped me.Bottom line: It's a really direct demon possession in the woods film. It is as horror as movies like these get. It is also similar to the story of the film they were remaking, which is good for any remake. However I really don't see a funny Evil Dead sequel coming up; it would have nothing to build on.",7,2,7,29 July 2013
The Imitation Game," A story that needed to be told, told in a way that is too Hollywood
","There is a formulaic quality in the way the movie was done that overshadowed the good acting and the important story of Turing's life. Much of the situations that had Cumberbatch's character as a focal point in the film were rarely so in real life and many were completely fabricated. I understand how telling the story of an autistic gay mathematician in a manner that would make people want to see it was not an easy job, but as such much of the movie felt cheap.Turing is credited for inventing the modern concept of computers, although, as the movie itself shows, his design for the machine that broke the Enigma code was not only based on a Polish design, but was a collaborative work with a person that isn't even mentioned in the film. The situation of him being treated the way he was because he was gay and the ridiculous way the British government refused to acknowledge they did anything wrong for half a decade is only briefly mentioned in a screen text at the end.Bottom line: if you know nothing of Turing and wish to watch a populist retelling of his story, so watch The Imitation Game. It is not a bad movie at all. However, if you are interested in the actual person, search for other sources of information.Personally, I am tired of this style of film in which an arrogant but brilliant ass of a person gets vindicated only because at the end he is proved right in one situation or another.",7,0,0,12 March 2017
The Evil Dead," It was my first!!!
","While I was watching the movie, I got this strong deja vu feeling over and over again. What the hell? In the end, when I've seen the last scene, I remembered: it was my first horror movie! I was then, at a fateful age of 5, after turning in my bed and crying with fear for 3 days, that I've decided that if you can't beat them, join them! I've been a fan of horror movies ever since!Now, I got the film because I've seen the wonderfully funny Evil Dead 3 and I just watched another Bruce Campbell film and wanted more. I wondered how funny will the first two Evil Dead movies be. This one is not really funny. It is a horror classic, with young people going up in the woods, fighting demons resurrected by ancient Sumerian incantations (from an audio tape).For an 1981 movie it's not bad. It's gory and the 'special' effects back then are hilarious: lots of colored plaster and red paint. A true horror fan should watch this at least for his resume :)",7,1,2,15 April 2006
Jurassic World," Clumsy money grabber is saved only by the great special effects
","This is a film for families, like all Jurassic movies so far, so they have to use a pseudo-family unit as the main character. They also have to tell you how to feel at every moment with blunt soundtrack bits that leave nothing to the imagination. The evil corporation, the arrogant rich man, the uncaring secretary and the opportunist need all be punished for their sins. Not so the sexy redhead who got everybody killed in the first place or the annoying children who do whatever they feel like it while a killer dino is on the loose . God, not the children!This sums up the plot of the film. There is absolutely no recipe for a quick buck that was not used in the movie and the rest, which is just as formulaic, is just special effects and a weird hybrid (see what I did there?) between Jurassic Park and Godzilla. Say what you will about Spielberg, the man knew subtlety.Points for not killing the black person first. They went with the Asian.",6,134,269,10 August 2015
Paranormal Activity," Boring as hell, 1:40 hours wasted completely.
","I respect movies that are made with no budget and great ideas. This film is not one of them. It features more than an hour of two people bickering and doing daily boring stuff. After that even the demon gets annoyed and acts out. Does that mean that the last half hour is a gruesome blood fest or something that is so scary that can keep you up at night? No. I actually tried to stay awake and failed.So let me save you the trouble. There is this couple thinking they may be haunted so they prepare with a camera and a laptop to document whatever is going on. Almost nothing does go on until 1 hour and 10 minutes into the film. Maybe watching it from there makes some sort of sense.Bottom line: I can't (I am trying hard right now) imagine any situation where I could be made to like this movie. If I were in a cinema, I would probably leave or snore half way through. Stay away from this over-hyped poc.",5,7,16,4 November 2009
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Well done, but not that original
","I had the idea of watching first the original movie and then this one. The script is almost identical, except for the last few minutes. The effects are a lot better, of course, but the movie did not remove the things that annoyed me in the first 1971 movie, nor did it make me feel more than the original.Wilder was creepy in the role of Willie Wonka, but Depp, even if he played marvelously, was only a bit weird, in the harmless way. Both the original movie and this one portraits parents that are rather passive to what happens to their children. I hated the songs in both versions. The good things are related to the quality of the visuals, of course. The end (different in the sense that the concept of family is held high like a banner in the forefront of the battle for our children souls. What, did I overdramatise? So did this movie) did nothing for me.Now, that I read my own review, I realize that I liked the original better. It felt out of time and kinda low budget, but it was better in the emotional sense and the storyline.It is essentially a children's story. Maybe I am not the one qualified to comment on it, then.",7,0,1,17 August 2005
The Adjustment Bureau," What if your life was running according to plan, just not your own?
","A sci-fi movie with Matt Damon and Emily Blunt that also features an epic love story? Who could not like something like that? Add John Slattery and Terence Stamp for good measure and you have a pretty good movie.The plot is adapted after a short by Philip K. Dick and you can feel that immediately in the film when Damon's character finds out people's lives are being controlled by a corporate like entity run by a chairman who writes the plan of what everybody should do. An adjustment team comes in whenever we mess with the master plan.There is not much I can add without spoiling it for you, but the ending kind of ruined it for me. You know when something spectacular happens in a hero movie and that's why he's the hero? Because other 99 people have tried the same thing and died like dumbasses at the start of the story? This film is kind of the same. Any smart person would feel the odds are ridiculously tilted in the other guy's direction and that the ending, however happy it might seem, is just a drop in a sea of sorrow.Other than that, a nice movie, but easily forgettable. Damon's Paycheck, perhaps, to bring out a parallel with his former friend Ben Affleck.",7,0,0,22 September 2012
Logan," A better mutant movie, but still not great
","Compared with the ridiculous leotard dressed PG-13 heroes of the X- Men movies so far, Logan is a masterpiece. Yet that's really not hot praise. The film is a little better, but still the same old tropes used again and again: the reluctant hero, the innocents that need protection, the educated psychotic killer and his brawny psychotic henchman. I get it, it's the hero's journey, but could you please, pretty please, take the scenic road once in a while?I thought the acting of the people involved was great. Also the idea of making an R-rated Old Man Logan movie was fresh. That is why my hopes were quite high on what else might be different. Other than showing blood, using s and f-words all the time and being depressing, Logan wasn't that much different than most recent action films, mutants or not. It might even have sequels, since it set up a sort of a New Mutants possible story line.Bottom line: if you don't expect the world of this film, it is enjoyable.",8,1,6,18 May 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Action followed by action then, surprisingly, some character development. Then some more action.
","So everybody must be asking now: 'Is it worth watching more than two hours of this just to get to the obligatory Thanos end credits scene?' and the answer is... yes. Besides making fun of War Machine - again - and completely ignoring characters like Pepper Potts and Falcon, there was nothing that bothered me tremendously about this film. Keep in mind that it is a comic book film with superheros that dress funny, though.The villain is pretty menacing, the interaction between the Avengers goes well beyond killing enemies in each other's blind spot and the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver addition was interesting, though kind of condescending. I mean, if they want to ban Tin-tin cartoons for racist depictions of African people, they should stop at one moment or another inventing countries with Slavic names and filling them with helpless women and children with names just as ridiculous and toy soldier police and army forces. I am just saying.What I thought was better than I was expecting from an Avengers movie were the underlying character stories. Thanks to Scarlet Witch we see bits of our heros' histories, we get to know Hawkeye a little better and understand his role in a team of superpowered individuals, he see the romantic side of Black Widow and the Hulk... yes, you read that right... and we get to see Captain America and Tony Stark having ideological arguments that divide the team. Of course, they carry them with vibranium shield throws and energy beams, like men do... don't they?I loved the character of The Vision, a freak hybrid between a servile AI and a full psycho AI, holding the power of an Infinity Stone and having a 3D printed body that is half alive, half vibranium. I share his view of humanity as queer pets that you have to enjoy during their short life.What I didn't like is that they upped the ante of what the Avengers can do, just because they could. In the end this diminished the level of empathy that one can feel for superhumans like that and removed from the quality of storytelling. Also, another film in which artificial intelligence builds bodies and kills people. Why would it? Ultron's motivation was completely unexplored and his philosophy and references to Pinocchio made no sense at all. OK, it was meant to be insane, but even insanity has purpose and sense. Overall, I think the biggest problem with the film was that it had too much of a budget.Bottom line: brainless fun, but fun nonetheless. Less humor than expected, with Ultron teasing an interesting character with his jokes, but then devolving to a classic villain in the sea of special effects that filled most of the movie. You get to know the Avengers more, as well, which was nice.",8,23,45,21 August 2015

I mean, OK, the story is nice, the visuals are nice, violins in the background, slightly computer enhanced color hue, but does it have to sound like someone's grandmother from the Southern Texas is telling the story?Conclusion: worth watching story of a relationship between father and son.

The Dark Knight," Finally! a good Batman movie
","I am tired. I really am. I've seen countless movies, lately with all kinds of silly dressed 'super'-heroes incredibly shiny, unbelievably lucky, ridiculously mannered, pathetically one-dimensional. Well, The Dark Knight features nothing like this. It almost felt real (if it weren't for the ludicrous scale of destruction in it) and it championed real emotions of frustration, anger, righteousness.It wouldn't have been possible without the actors, though. A film of complex emotions needs complex actors. Just look at that cast! And for a very long time, good actors played good roles, not just appearing to get people into cinema seats. Not to mention that it was a retelling of a story that was told a many a time before and it was original, powerful, meaningful!Bottom line: a meaningful film! A film with meaning! I don't know how to repeat it so it sticks: this was the real thing, a movie like they should be, even if (for me at least) the subject was not the greatest ever. But movies with far more serious subjects than black caper heroes show not a bit of the consideration shown by the makers of Batman - The Dark Knight for the viewers. Congratulations!",9,2,6,28 September 2008
Into the Wild," A beautiful, if a bit long, film
","It is hard to watch the movie and not experience feelings of longing for the beauty of life as shown in it. You have this young man who is determined to wander the world, reach Alaska and live off the land. He renounces a good life, a wealthy suburban family and the trappings of modern human society and embarks onto this epic quest to find the truth of life and of being. The movie is nothing if not beautiful, in the shots, the music by Eddie Vedder (Pearl Jam) and the great cast. Emile Hirsch is amazing in the lead role and people like Vince Vaughn, William Hurt, Marcia Gay Harden and a lovely 17 years old Kristen Stewart support him well.But not all is rosy. At two hours and a half long and slow in pace, this is an atmospheric film. You need to be in the mood to see it, to be under no time or people pressure, just in order to experience the truth of absolute freedom that writer and director Sean Penn wants to express. Also, the story is heavily dramatized, since there are a lot of inconsistencies between the facts and what you see in the film. I strongly recommend watching the movie before you research the real story. The combination of great outdoors, interesting book quotes and personal anecdotes of the people he meets makes for a nice story, but in the end the telling of it is more important than the subject at hand.Bottom line: the movie reminded me a little of On the Road (also having Kristen Stewart in a supporting role) with the same idea of the great American road quest, personal freedom and exploration of the soul. If you liked that movie, you will like this one, too. You have to reserve the time and disposition to watch it and experience it. On the Road was better, though.",9,0,1,29 December 2017
Blood Diamond," This film mixes City of the Gods and The Constant Gardener, but it goes way too soft
","Great performance by Leonardo DiCaprio, which again proves he is a great actor when he wants to. The movie portrays the civil war in Sierra Leone, a battle sponsored by the diamonds that people slave about in the mud to get.It is a good movie, worth seeing and praised even by people who have lived in the area. However, I felt it went soft in order to accommodate the cinema market. When the feelings get strong, the movie goes easy, inserts a funny moment or a glorious speech. The Americans are shown as compassionate people fighting for the good of mankind, while the diamond companies that pray on the African misery just exceptions, with 'good' diamond dealers coming to testify and support the ban on 'blood diamond' commerce.Memorable part of the movie, an old man saying he hopes they don't find oil there, or they'd really be screwed. Bottom line: good movie, but it doesn't touch The Constant Gardener, Cidade de Deus or Syriana.",7,0,1,8 July 2007
War Machine," Intriguing perspective on the US war on whatever
","It wasn't a movie I enjoyed very much, but it was a good movie. You can feel it in your guts. It's a description of the US operations in Afghanistan, and I had expected a liberal viewpoint that made fun of the mess there. But it wasn't so. It actually showed viewpoints from multiple perspectives.Brad Pitt plays a general, newly appointed to the region in order to 'fix things'. And he is trying to. He fights bureaucracy, politicians, and insurgents alike in order to get things done. He has a faithful group of subordinates who worship him and help him do whatever he wants. Ironically, his technical approach makes him the enemy of the US administration, which only needs to show they are trying, without actually having to succeed. Ben Kingsley has a few scenes as president Karzai that are ridiculously funny, too. 'But I am acting as a leader. I am unavailable', he says in one scene. Hilarious.In the end, one cannot but sympathize with a guy who wants to end the war, militarily or course, by unequivocally winning it, regardless of what human issues are hindering the victory. He has a job to do, even if it's obvious no one wants him to do it. The movie shows how these kinds of 'wars' were never meant to be won, even if you had someone actually trying to.Bottom line: A movie is impressive when it manages to portray a US army general as a simple task oriented technician, hired like you would hire a plumber to do a job. It gets even more impressive when it shows how impossible that job really is. And the acting was great. The mood was a little too deadpan for me. It is something that amuses you internally while you wonder why everything is moving so slow. I believe this was deliberate, in order for the viewer to understand a little bit of how slow things are really moving in the real world.",8,22,32,24 September 2017
Puss in Boots," Funny, but less than I imagined
","If this was a standalone animation film, maybe I would have considered it above average, but my reference is Shrek and, even if the last films of the franchise were not great, Puss in Boots is not at the same level.Yes, it does try to capitalize on the remaining Anglo-Saxon fairy tales like Jack and the Beanstalk and Humpty Dumpty, but it fails short of the character extravaganza that Shrek was. And while Antonio Banderas is very good as the cat, the Western like setting and even the animation is not expressing enough emotion to make one empathise with the characters. And I am a cat person, so that's saying a lot.Bottom line: I've laughed aloud a few times, but that's about it. The combination of a man and a cat got stuck right in the middle, being neither attractive, nor cute. The story felt fragmented and the dialogues forced. I am sure children would love it, but it was a disappointment to me.",7,0,1,30 April 2012
Elysium," Neil Blomkamp fails to rehash District 9
","The film was entertaining, but not great. Blomkamp, made famous by the sci-fi metaphor for Apartheid in South Africa, tries his hand again, with more money, good actors and Mexicans instead of Africans. But his metaphor now is strained, the script unchiselled and the acting empty. Neither Matt Damon's presence or Alice Braga's smile could save the lack of involvement that plagued the script.That's not to mean it is not watchable. Many a bad movie were released as summer blockbuster and made me angry at paying for them. Elysium was not like that, but only barely. If you make the effort to design an overpopulated and unmanaged Earth controlled by unsympathetic robots and rich overlords that live on a giant space station and have God-like technology, then continue this effort in adding depth to characters and their stories, making sure there are not blatant (even offensive) gaps in the logic of the world created.Matt Damon's natural talent at acting saved this film from being a failure. You could probably just stop him on the street, give him the script and ask him to act a little and he would do it fine. The special effects were fine, maybe better than fine. But the rest just felt tired: Jodie Foster in her most two dimensional character ever, Michael Shanks appearing in a few scenes in the background (I am not sure he said anything) a story that made as much sense as Hunger Games and a deep misunderstanding of socio-economics, not to say politics, that made it all look like a cheap game.Bottom line: Blomkamp's metaphor for the gap between Mexicans and US citizens failed to impress in any way because it was deeply flawed. The only way one could empathise with it is to actually see the future where robots are everywhere and poor people are not required for menial tasks anymore, but that would be a lot more complex than what this film can offer. If you want something good like that, just watch Sleep Dealer.",7,0,2,24 August 2013
Taken," The French Connection Commando
","Remember that Arnold movie called Commando when some bad guy took his daughter and then... well... died? It's just like that, but with Liam Neeson and it is set in Paris.The question I ask myself when I see movies like these is 'How real could that be?'. And I am not talking about how likely it is to casually kill or otherwise incapacitate tens of people and getting away with it, but how likely it is to gather data, torture or threaten with death or torture to get more data and so on until you get to the top of the human trafficking system in a very short time? I understand the need for due process and everything, but hell, Liam Neeson's character took out a complete human flesh network from the bottom up in a few days. And I liked that. So how likely is it?Bottom line: pure action flick, with a expected good performance from Mr. Neeson. My only concern is how can the offspring of a cool Liam Neeson and sexy Famke Janssen result in the annoying Maggie Grace? :)",7,0,0,8 May 2009
Alice in Wonderland," Amazingly boring and unrelated to the books
","This was a failed movie by many a reason, starting with the expectations raised by a Tim Burton movie and ending with the unsympathetic characters therein. There was a scene where 3D animated dogs and pups play together. They should have taken that and made it a movie and forget about the Alice in Wonderland idea.What was also incredible to me was the enormous distance from the books to this 'adaptation'. Go on, read the Wikipedia article on Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass. The genius of Lewis Carroll was not in making another book about a delusional child, but the internal logic of the worlds and the mathematical and chess foundations of the work. It was something special. They completely trashed that.Bottom line: Tim Burton usually makes terrifyingly beautiful animation and script work. This was both banal and boring. I didn't really like Mia Wasikowska in In Treatment, but she was brilliant in that show compared to the cold 'I am just going with it because I don't care' look in this film. Even Johnny Depp messed up with his inconsistent Scottish accent. No, really, however I look at it, this film is an utter disappointment.",5,3,5,19 February 2011
Avatar," A feast for the eyes with very little substance
","It is hard to enjoy a movie about the fight against greedy oppressors when the entire plot is based on cheap exploitation of the viewer's feelings. I agree it was a great experience, as the CGI were amazing, but the story made no more sense than a children's tale. Evil and stupid villains, pure hearted heroes that are equally mindless, peaceful nature loving folk (that always walk around armed to the teeth) that are to be saved by the hero, otherwise completely lost, etc.I swear to you, one could make a film with the same script in some highschool, where the hero comes in a BMW and saves the day and gets the girl (only here it's a flying carnivore).I also watched in 3D, but I was unimpressed. Basically, there are parts of the scene that are focused differently, getting that weird effect you see at '3D' cardboard pictures that you raise in children books. I can only assume that it was a movie like any other movie and then they worked on it to make it 3Dish.Bottom line: as the script and the 3D experience both forced me to think of children's tales in children books, I can't say that I was really satisfied. After all, I am not a child anymore. But if you expect this to be true (and I was when I went to see the movie) you can enjoy it just like any other easy weekend movie and get immersed into the atmosphere of things.As a side note (bottom lines and side notes... I am making a 3D review here!) I don't agree that Cameron does silly movies and I should have expected this. Aliens, The Abyss and Terminator all had some complex scripts behind them, even when we were drowning in special effects. Using such a plain plot for the movie is, in my personal view, inexcusable.And as a funny note: this is a movie that you need glasses to see, about a guy that needs a computerized link to walk in order to connect through some weird external neural links in order to fly.",8,0,2,30 January 2010
Frank," Good film, but not for everyone's taste
","Like Frank's band's music, not everyone is going to love this film, but it is a very good one. Well acted, well crafted, its only issue is the subject, which is both very weird and sensitive, funny and terribly tragic. It's a road trip movie, in its essence: the normal guy gets swept by the charisma and magic of a band and he joins them, body and soul. Yet the ending is not happy, nor extremely sad, it's just... what did you expect it was going to happen? It also feels like a play, with basically four actors and some stand ins. They are all great in their performances, if you dig the story. It all stands on that one point: will you understand the story and the feelings of the characters? Bottom line: if you like it, you will probably love it. You might not like it.",8,0,0,11 September 2018
Drag Me to Hell," Subaverage horror, great comedy!
","You can't take this film seriously, you just can't. It is so absurd and funny that it can only be a comedy. Does it feature scary old gypsy women and malevolent spirits and curses and such? Yes. Is that scary? No.I was caught by surprise a few times by my own laughter and then, fully realizing it is a comedy, I started enjoying the movie. The bad acting was really a masterful director stroke to make the film funnier. The gross and gratuitous scenes of old women juices were there to provide extra laughs. The beautiful blonde ambitious bank employee that can drive, think on her feet in dangerous and surprising situations was there for balance, to bring contrast to other horror movies where people are usually annoying screaming victims begging to be killed. It was all part of the movie and now I can totally understand the true value of it.On the other hand, since you just read thus far you also know it, so watching the film would be a waste of time.",7,1,2,23 February 2010
Grindhouse," Two movies of completely different quality
","I can only average this movie because Rodriguezes Planet Terror was wonderful while Tarantino's Death Proof was awful.First, Planet Terror was gruesome, gorish, ridiculous, full of hot chicks and completely and utterly fun. In a time in cinematography where every single crappy script writer takes himself seriously, this pulls no punches, making it the funnest film I've seen since Feast. Lots of fun in casting as well. Fergie looks hotter than in any of her videos.I have all the respect in the world for Kurt Russell, a great actor that could have had a lot more meaningful roles. In Death Proof he plays well, but the film itself is completely boring. 50 minutes of watching painful dialogue (and SMSing) between brainless bimbos and their horny boyfriends, then they die. End part 1. Next set of bimbos, again painful and boring dialogue. Kurt Russell appears. End part 2. End movie. WTF?",7,0,1,9 April 2008
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Continues part 1 with the same blend of teen feelings and lack of purpose
","Having just watched the first part of the movie, which ended saying nothing after a whole bunch of feely scenes that also said nothing, it felt only natural to consider that at some time, after all was said and (hopefully) done, there will be a point to all of this. After all, this is a 'saga' so it must have an 'epic' ending. And it didn't, really!The first half of the film was more like part 1, then a threat was revealed and allies were gathered. This part started to get my hopes up: vampires from all over the world, each one with a different 'gift', came together to fight the dreadful Volturi. Even the wolves joined in. And then the epic battle!Let me just say that after hours of suffering the egotism and mindlessness of all involved, doing nothing and feeling a whole lot of stuff that I didn't, the ending was far from 'epic'. Also, it wasn't really the ending, which was more akin to a Dallas episode. And then the entire franchise... ended. With nothing at all to show for it. Like a soap opera, the fact that a bunch of people you don't care about are living their life is not something interesting or worth wasting time with. That's all!",6,3,5,24 February 2013
Mama," Interesting concept, but bad film
","The idea of a couple of little girls adopted by a vengeful ghost is very interesting and compelling. If it didn't all transform yet again into a 'family doesn't get what is going on with their children in their white picket fence house', it would have been great. Add to it the 'fringe scientist' interested in the girls and a mopey story about a woman who desperately wanted a child and you get a real punch down the throat with all the possible clich√©s that you could think of.But still, freaky children, insane motherly ghost, rock band surrogate mom, Jamie Lannister (twice)... it could have worked fine. However the lackluster script, the horrible CGI and the dull acting made it a terrible experience for me.Bottom line: Enough with the camera point of view scares and the CGI monsters that appear from nowhere! It's not the 90's anymore!",5,3,6,19 July 2014
Super 8," A modern E.T. with some interesting ideas
","In 1982, Steven Spielberg produced a movie called 'E.T.' which went to become an instant classic. In it, an alien is stranded on Earth and a child is helping the frightened creature return home, defying authority and following his heart. This film has an eerily similar plot.There are differences, though. This alien is huge, has no problem killing people and only in one scene seems to blend into a semblance of the E.T. we know and love. The effects are obviously better and the kids are brilliant in their play, especially Elle Fanning, who at 13 seems to be an already well established actress.Bottom line: this is more of a thought provoking film, rather than a kiddie, heart melting, 'Awww' thing. It might be one of the few J.J.Abrams scripts that I liked. I actually waited so long to watch it because he directed the film. It is not a masterpiece, but it accomplishes every goal set.",Null,0,0,17 August 2011
Snowden," Great job from Joseph Gordon-Levitt
","It's tough to comment on a movie that is based on real events. If they change anything, they sold out to the dramatic sensationalist side, if they show it as it was, it is too boring.As such, Snowden is a mediocre movie because it doesn't inflame me with rage on how much they changed the truth, nor does it disappoint me with just listing dull facts. But the movie is well done, well acted with a great performance from Gordon-Levitt and, more than anything, it tells the damn story. The story here is important.First of all, it is always possible that people have not heard of or not understood the Snowden incident. It is important for them to hear and understand it. Then it is always possible that, having been informed, they choose to remain indifferent, on the basis that even with a whole world knowing what the secret services of the US are doing, nothing has changed. Those people are wrong. It was an unreasonable expectation for one man to change a half a trillion dollar industry by himself. However, it was never hoped that a man can make any difference against these kinds of odds and Snowden did so. We can discuss about this today, with facts not fantasies, because of what that man did.When faced with seemingly overwhelming power, most people submit. They do so not because of the power itself, but its appearance, the perceived consequences of fighting it. Snowden showed that even the most powerful are not omnipotent or omniscient and that they still have to answer to all of us. As the carrier of this message, I applaud the movie.Yet, as someone who knew of the real life events, I had only the dramatics of the film to entertain me and those, understandably so, were not many. You know what would really make my day, though? An aftermath movie. A Snowden sequel with everything (if anything) that has changed, watching the people in the middle of it, even if it is all dramatic fiction based on what we publicly know. Because right now the greatest enemy of people getting why this film was important is the bleak realization that essentially little has changed and they fail to grasp the importance of those little changes.",8,0,3,4 December 2016
How to Train Your Dragon," Terribly predictable, but very fun as well
","I have two girls here that loved the hell out of the movie. And they look good! What else do you need from a review? The animation is pretty nice, even if 3Dish, with very realistic facial expressions, bright colors and large landscapes. The plot is kind of classic, with the weird kid who longs for his father's acceptance and the love of the town's girl getting his wish. The twists are that the kid is a viking and their entire village is plagued by pesky dragons. In the end, a peaceful solution is found, even if a bit ironic. Let's say it's a typically human solution and leave it at that.What I liked about the movie is that the animated characters were not mere projections of the actors playing them, and the animals were not anthropomorphised versions of their real selves. Actually, the black dragon with big green eyes looked and behaved suspiciously like my black cat with big green eyes. Only a bit smarter... and flying. Clearly a cat lover worked on this film.Bottom line: has a Shreky freshness to it, even if the script is not parody funny, but situation funny. Good quality in animation, voices, direction and storyline. The ending was a bit mushy, but full of good tension and held itself well. Oh, and the girls loved it.",8,1,2,7 October 2010
"Sal√≤, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Ungradable, it's an interesting experience that was never meant to be enjoyed
","From all the movies I've reviewed so far, I leave this without a vote. The idea of the movie is to show you depravity at its worst, in order to make you feel the moral outrage of Pasolini. Anyone who actually enjoyed watching the film should have their heads examined.The quality of acting, directing, video and audio, etc, are really poor for today's standards and also for 1975. There is no art in the film in the sense that you could examine it in a film class and discuss camera shots. Therefore the only thing remaining to analyse is the subject. It shows teenage boys and girls being tortured by sadistic rich fascists, helped by young soldiers who are just following orders and servants who are just getting paid.The degradation and torture of the kids is truly disgusting, in a way that few people can even consider sexually pleasing. The fact that they are fascists is incidental, though, and considering the film is an adaptation of a Marquis de Sade book, it is an irony that it is used to disgust people, when probably Sade was considering it a fine sexual fantasy. Actually, I never knew Pasolini; one could argue that as he was morally outraged by politics he was secretly excited by this stuff and did the greatest S&M film he could think of for purposes of self gratification.For the casual viewer this film is thrice difficult to endure: film quality is low, the language is Italian and the English translation far from perfect, and the content is basically unsexy porn with a story. I mean, who would watch that? I also think Pasolini's rebellion against disgusting leaders that do their thing from depravity alone was valid, yet his method was effective only in showing us what he felt of it, rather than make us empathize with him.One can see anything into anything if they make the effort. For me, I believe it was pointless to endure through this film and I would not recommend beyond knowing it exists and reading a few reviews about it. Unless you like that kind of stuff, then I totally recommend it, even if the actors are all kind of grotesque, including the teens.",Null,4,6,8 February 2015
Total Recall," Clunky Robocop on Mars, starring Conan
","Just having seen Total Recall in both incarnations, I can review the old 1990's one with a fresh perspective. The thing with the recall (heh) is that I remembered this film as one that I liked. Sure, it was a bit awkward and it made no sense for any science, but I did like it. And now, 22 years later from its making, I watched it again. And, for no good reason other than nostalgia, I liked it again.Now, it is a film made by the director of Robocop. The corporate evil, the clunky metal vehicles, the gratuitous violence, they are all there, along with ridiculous dialogue and bad acting, but some of the bits of the film show good design and thinking. Add to this Sharon Stone when she was hot, Michael Ironside when he was young and Arnold Schwarzenegger doing Conan the Barbarian on Mars, with submachine guns and you get a cheesy, clunky, ridiculous film that somehow feels good.What is the secret? I don't know. Probably Paul Verhoeven saw in the film the same flaws that I see and just didn't give a damn. He accepted the shortcomings of technology and of himself and did the film as well as he could in the circumstances. Bottom line: not really a good film, but who can say it was a bad one?",7,1,4,4 November 2012
Limitless," What would you do if you suddenly got really smart?
","I am pretty sure that you wouldn't do what this guy did. Anyway, it is a fun movie with an interesting premise and they even made a TV series of it, so if you like it, you could carry on having the fun.The story is about a guy who inadvertently finds a stash of mind enhancing drugs. He climbs up in the world pretty fast, so people notice and try to stop him, naturally. The way they do it and how he handles them is pretty hard to swallow, but then again, if you were really smart you wouldn't use your own person and name to become famous in stock trading. You would just make money, discreetly.The acting is OK, I would say the Bradley Cooper's acting makes the film more than the subject (or the horrible soundtrack). The script needed an overhaul, though, so don't expect something terribly smart (see what I did there?) At least it's not Lucy.",7,0,0,26 November 2015
Sicario," Psychologically brutal, but one note throughout
","The movie is a bit long, at two hours, but it is a good movie, so I can let it slide. The acting is very good and the low note music is driving the mood of the film right into your soul. However, that note is the only one you will hear or feel throughout. What actually happens is just cementing the one and only idea of the film, that if you go high enough there is no justice, no morals and that reality is uglier than any of us want to know.The story follows a character that is supposed to take us through the rabbit hole. As a competent cop, but completely outside the drug related action, she is the unknowing individual who will get her eyes open, thus opening ours. However I found it difficult to empathize with anything she did or said. She came off as a petulant girl, trying to ignore what was happening to her, desperately attempting to feel in control when she had none. That was deliberate, of course, as the movie reveals our own petulant yet powerless stance.There is nothing else to be said, really. It is a slap in the face for people who still believe in the high ideals of justice for all or in some semblance of power over our lives, but a rather bland film for those who have already accepted there are no rules and they have no control.",8,0,0,9 January 2016
Departures," A very Japanese movie that also translates exceptionally to Western culture. Death is truly universal.
","The movie is based on a personal memoir of 'a Budhist mortician', written by Shinmon Aoki, and is very well filmed and acted. The story is about a man who returns to his home town after a failed attempt at a career in the big town and gets a job as a mortician. What is not immediately apparent to non Japanese is that any job involving handling dead people is traditionally seen as unclean and that explains some of the reactions of the people in the film. In the end, helping someone pass through the 'gateway' of death is presented as cathartic, noble and spiritual.A very beautiful film that I recommend watching. The only issue that I could see is with its length, which is a little over two hours.",10,0,0,27 January 2019
The Descent," A rather good horror movie
","As horror movies go, this is a chick movie. Nah, I am joking, but the cast is entirely female. The few unfortunate males that try to act in this script are quickly killed in a brutal way. And as horror movies go, I will rate it as high. The director, also known for Dog Soldiers or 28 Days, has a feel for tense situations and the extreme way in which people react when faced with unpredictable danger.Now, if you've read most other comments, you would have understood that this is not a clich√© movie. Wrong! It follows a very known horror recipe: closed environment in which a team of people face danger and die one after the other until the twist comes. The problem with most movies of this sort is that you never understand why strong military types or world renowned scientists completely collapse mentally when faced with animals or monsters or whatever, neither do they explain the maddened kill frenzy that usually ensues when the stress gets high enough. Well, this movie solves the problem: the entire cast is female! :)The strange predators are also cool and the fact that everything happens inside a cave makes it truly scary and disconcerting. But what is a cave without claustrophobia, rheumatism and a few trolls, right? Go see it.",8,1,3,18 August 2006
Inside Man," You just have to get tired of this kind of movies
","It's nothing new. You get a bunch of first class actors, or at least having famous names, then you get a classic plot, you change the twist, you bag the money. It's simpler than robbing a bank, because it's legal. But it should be outlawed, that's for certain.The movie is not bad. The direction is obviously good, the budget appropriate, the acting excellent. It's the plot that makes it all crap. And the end moral, about punishing the people that benefited from the Holocaust? That makes me sick. I am sure that event payed itself with interest just from the clich√É¬© movies that came out of it. And those last scenes, just after a short critique on the exaggeration of racial issues in America, with a cop twisting his tongue to say 'african American'. And it's a Spike Lee movie. He could have found a black people massacre to reference, or was it a requirement from the producers? Bleah!Conclusion: very average bank robery movie, with a rather boring beginning, and a tired old twist, reminiscent of the 60 movies.",7,2,3,21 May 2006
Jack Reacher," A very decent action thriller
","The trailer, the tagline and all the talk about some books that this is supposed to be based on are doing only to hurt the film, which is actually pretty good. The characters are well defined, the acting is good and the plot and story are both thrilling and believable, with just the right amount of violence and special effects. Somebody actually took the effort to direct the drive scene based on the muscle car that Cruise was driving: powerful, noisy, it's back going all over the place from poor handling.Rarely these day have I seen a direct and effective thriller of such a good quality. Yet, when you see the trailer, you hear the horrid tagline with 'Reacher will reach you' and read the even worse tag from IMDb, which makes Jack Reacher sound like a superhero, you see that Tom Cruise is playing the lead role and that it is all based on some pulp books that sound a lot like comics, you can't help thinking the movie will suck, and that is making a great disservice to a film that was clearly made with care and effort.That doesn't mean it is a masterpiece of cinema, mind you. The ending is horrible. You can feel the Hollywood corporate stench on you, soiling all the good from the rest of the film. Also I thought Rosamund Pike's character and acting were taken from some male fantasy of the subservient woman, ready to accept her place beneath the great man. And the black guy... worse actor of them all, yet the starting scene, when he appears with his gun in his hand, trying to look all confident and dangerous... what a joke.Bottom line: a movie worth watching, even if flawed. It sets an example on how to make a decent movie even from a blockbusting action thriller that is supposed to cash just because of the lead actor.",8,2,4,31 May 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Therapy of the Galaxy
","The film was OK. I mean, the far off 3D shots were something fresh, the acting was good, the production values were good. Yet I could see right off the bat that something was off. You know when something is off where everything in the plot is related to family (pardon the pun): it means no more ideas.While Guardians 1 was fresh and unexpectedly good, the sequel took the subtleties out and enhanced everything else: special effects, family drama, toilet humor and above all, spin off seeds. That's how you get dialogues like 'Ow, my nipples' and 'We're not friends, we're family!' (which could only have worked as a parody of Fast and Furious).So instead of exploring strange new worlds, we again collapse the entire story to the dynastic relations between a few characters: Quill's dad(s), Gamora's sister, Nebula's dad, Rocket's similar other, Yondu's surrogate dad, and so on, while everything else is just pow pow, pew pew! and some really pathetic jokes. They even added a new member that feels and sometimes manipulates emotions. Oh no! Not Deana Troy!By the end I was tired of childhood trauma's expositions and group therapy like teary embraces. Stuff is not supposed to make total sense in a Marvel story, but they went so overboard that I couldn't care anymore. And no, I am not excited about the Ravagers spin off (or tip of the hat to the 60s Guardians from the comics), the Adam Warlock spin off, the Stan Lee spin off or any of this crap. They only needed to make Guardians 2 as good as the first. They failed.",7,1,5,24 May 2017
The Da Vinci Code," An OK American thriller. Nothing more.
","I went to the film not expecting much and I didn't get much either. It was a rather clich√© solve-the-puzzle-while-running-for-your-life plot, not unlike Indiana Jones or similar movies and series. The only thing different is the idea of Jesus having a wife and children and the Church actively working against it. I didn't care one way or the other, so I didn't find anything really interesting in this. Now, what I would have liked to see is the whole thing revealed to the world and the social and religious changes on the world. Now THAT would have been a great book.Conclusion: reasonable acting, reasonable plot, shamefully small role for Jean Reno. I also have a conspiracy theory about this film. I think it has a hidden meaning that Magneto would kick Doc Ock's ass if they were to fight.",7,6,13,19 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Better Potter movie than the third, kindda cramped
","OK, I admit, I don't really remember the book. I found the scenes vaguely familiar through the movie, but I only remembered the general storyline. Yet the movie had that feeling of movie being cramped into a box to make a movie out of it.Don't get me wrong, it's way better than the third catastrophe of a Harry Potter movie, but it fails to capture the feelings of the characters as the first two movies did and, of course, the book. And if you don't go to the cinema to see special effects, then it's the story and characters feelings that interest you.I can't wait to see how the other two books will be translated into film, although I really await the release of the seventh book more than anything. I do hope that what's important in Harry Potter will find its way more into the movies: the magic. People need to feel the wonders of the Potter world, not see sparks and flames coming out off wands.",7,0,0,27 November 2005
In Time," Ridiculously bad script
","It is a paradox that blockbuster American movies are so well made in terms of acting, directing, editing and overall resources, but they often suck where it matters most: the script! This is one of those unfortunate cases where an intriguing idea is utterly destroyed by a childish story.Imagine Bonnie and Clyde in an overly capitalistic world that looks a lot like Equilibrium. People are immortal, biologically frozen at 25 years, but they have this ridiculous green glowing clock on their arms, counting down to a moment when they die. They use time as a currency, earning it, stealing it, buying with it. A very interesting concept, an abstractisation of reality. But they botch it up!A society that can genetically engineer humans with a glowing clock on their hands can also insure some cryptographic safety in the mechanism, so that people don't steal it away. The cars sound electric, but they are normal looking. People work in factories doing meaningless tasks, computers seem to do only voices and almost anything can be done with a single gun and a bit of determination. It makes no sense.Some of the scenes are so bad that it makes teeth ache. Such an interesting idea and such a poor job implementing it. This is barely a 6 movie and I was very close to a 5. One should avoid it.",6,1,2,24 February 2012
Thor," Decent no brainer
","It is obvious that you will like this movie depending solely on your expectations.If you see that the director is Kenneth Branagh, of previous Hamlet fame, and that the story is by Babylon 5's J. Michael Straczynski, you might expect something a lot better, especially since Natalie Portman and Anthony Hopkins star in it.However, if you know nothing about the Thor comic books and you think that some guy with a hammer will fight crime while spouting viking bull crap, then you will enjoy the movie, because it is nothing of the sort.The design of the Viking and Frost Giant worlds was nice, the acting was decent and Chris Hemsworth steals all the 'aaaahs' of the female viewers. And I personally enjoyed the movie. However, I can't help but hate the clich√©s that jut their ugly heads, to the detriment of everything. I really rooted for Loki after all the idiocy exhibited by the people of Valhalla, so they had to make him look like an emotional idiot at the end. Why can't we love and understand both sides? Is it too complicated for the viewers?Bottom line: Check in your brain and you will enjoy it. The 3D aspects of the movie are irrelevant. It is just a normal 2D film with a bit of perspective added to it. The roles are that of Thor and Loki, with a bunch of supporting actors that have nothing to do.",7,0,2,19 June 2011
The Happening," Signs meets War of the Worlds, but no match
","It was an interesting idea and interpretation, but it was a too long a movie to present a single idea. At least Day of the Trifids has had some action.Short plot line: the plants are upset and are starting to kill people off. They panic, run, talk nonsense and scream a lot. Then they kill themselves. I really like Mark Wahlberg, but I think his performance was mediocre, something I would say about most other actors as well. What happened to John Leguizamo to get such a marginal role?Bottom line: if Mel Brooks would have entrusted his daughter to Tom Cruise, while aliens would have chemically bombed the US as punishment from God for desecrating planet Earth, it would have been The Happening with a slightly larger budget, but without Tom Cruise's excellent acting from War of the Worlds.",6,0,4,28 July 2008
Castle in the Sky," Howl meets Atlantis
","I like Miyazaki movies and this one is no exception. However, after a few animations like this, the theme of innocent romance and youthful courage defeating the corrupt power of government and military alike start getting old.The story: in an alternate world resembling very much the world in Howl's Moving Castle, only a lot more airborne, there is a legend of a floating island where riches and enormous power can be found, named Laputa. Of course, people start looking for it, for various reasons, resulting in a massive conflict of interest. In the end, being human, young and alive is far more important than being powerful and technologically advanced, therefore the child queen of Laputa utters the word of destruction and everything blows away. Everybody good lives, everybody bad dies.In the end the animation is great, but I expected that, so is the music and the basic storyline, however the moral got lost somehow between the obviously Japanese fear of technological disaster and characters of unreasonable courage and moral strength. I never expected Miyazaki to be realistic, but at least I wanted the movie to be unpredictable. It is full of clich√©s.Maybe the overall resemblance to Atlantis: The Lost Empire also made me fear a Disney contamination of Japanese anime, but in the end, both movies have the same audience, so why not be more like each other?",7,2,8,4 December 2005
The Shape of Water," The hype of water
","The film starts with an interesting premise: during the Cold War era, a US government research center has captured a strange amphibious creature and the protagonist is a mute cleaning lady. From the beginning the story overflows with symbols if intolerance: towards women, towards handicapped people, black people, amphibious people, immigrants, gays, old people, and so on and so on. It's like it's trying to check all the boxes, see how many it gets in a single row. But while it does this, the story itself just stalls. This is a two hour long movie in which nothing much happens. It shows intolerance, but doesn't go anywhere with it. Yes, we know people are assholes and that during that era, they were slightly worse than now. It does nothing for the plot, which is predictable and boring. The bad man is reminiscent of Pan's Labyrinth villain and the main character a girl with an active imagination, but it is way slower and more poorly executed than Pan's. It is clearly a worse movie than that was. To put it mildly, I am at a loss for why this film won Best Picture. It was visually interesting, but you couldn't take it seriously. It went from metaphor to reality with no regard to the previous context. A villain that seemed to not have a purpose other than being obtuse and evil, a woman who after learning that the creature has bit two fingers off a man's hand goes near it and offers it food from her own hand, a black best friend who's only role is to gossip about her irrelevant husband, some Russian spies that seem more interested in food than in spying, the list goes on and on. It's not like the actors didn't do a good job, it's not that the direction or the sets were faulty, but the story itself was nothing more than a long slow cliche.",6,7,13,14 March 2018
The Disaster Artist," Talk about meta
","A movie about the making of another movie that has now reached cult status for how bad it is, The Disaster Artist shows what kind of man Tommy Wiseau was. And the painted picture is both endearing and terrifying. A middle aged East European immigrant that in a bad heavily accented English claims he is twenty something and comes from New Orleans, he has enough money to own apartments in major US cities and buy the equipment needed to make a movie in which he would write, direct and play the main role. And he does it all with a childish enthusiasm that is completely separated from reality or the emotions of the people around him. The Room, the movie this film is about, is really bad. I mean Birdemic is a masterpiece of screenplay and acting in comparison. It is so bad that the scenes about the making of it are cringeworthy. But James Franco directed and acted in a realistic portrayal of what happened and it truly does take talent to reenact the scenes as in the original movie. He is a tragicomic Wiseau and went so far into the role that I had difficulty remembering how the real person looked like.Bottom line: if you at least enjoy the concept of the film The Room, you will like this film. If you have not heard of it, it is somehow in the vein of Ed Wood, the movie with Johnny Depp. While watching it I had visions of a reinterpretations of the events in a form similar to Shadow of the Vampire or Man from Earth. It would certainly explain Tommy's behavior, shady origin and infinite finances.",7,0,2,24 January 2018
Zombieland," Really boring
","Can one hate a movie for being too American? I mean, really, guns, SUVs and Twinkies? Where does all that electricity come from anyway? I guess people can enjoy seeing a curly insecure virgin boy looking out of place no matter what the script. Because there is not much in the way of script here.From the high rating on IMDb and from all the hype I though it would be worth watching this. I was wrong: it was a total waste of time, not funny as a comedy, not thrilling as a zombie movie, not touching as a personal drama.Bottom line: it's practically a romcom with zombies. Same lack of plot, ludicrous premise and acrid aftertaste. Oh, and zombies. Meh!",6,2,4,5 November 2009
The Departed," Of rats and men
","This movie is a good one, worth watching and all. This being said, I got kind of bored watching it. I mean, OK, the tension was 'female repelling' high and the idea was kind of funny. But in the end you just ask yourself are you the wiser for watching the movie or did you just waste 150 minutes of your life?The actors all play very well, the directing is flawless and I even liked the soundtrack. It was an inspirational insight into the lives of Italo-Irish mobsters and the state police, locked into a perpetual battle that no single side can win. Yet, it was all it was.Bottom line: you have to either enjoy the genre very much and see the references to other movies of the same type or have a lot of time on your hands to watch it and really like it.",8,1,2,21 March 2007
The Witch," Slow tale of the dissolution of a family
","The movie starts with the banishment of a guy from a colony in America because he was too religious. What an asshole he must have been. Therefore he leaves with his entire family of wife and three children and a babe - plus several goats - to make a life of his own in an isolated cabin. When children start dying in mysterious circumstances, the family starts to break apart, while accusations and fear of witchcraft fly uncontrolled.I loved this part of the story and I liked that the pace is slow and uncomfortable. Nothing really happens other than see backward people do backward things and then suffering for it, but the acting is good, the pain is transmitted well and you kind of understand how they get to where they're getting.The part that I didn't like is that with all the setup, they had to introduce a few scenes with 'the witch', which was absolutely superfluous. If they would have shown no witches and kept the viewer guessing, the impact would have been greater, I believe. Also, with a supernatural cause for everything the writer/director denies the viewer the choice of believing in God's salvation, in the possibility of controlling the situation by ordinary folk or of any hope for the ending. It's just like 'Bambi meets Godzilla', the outcome is pretty much set. Add a slow pace to this and I am sure people will be upset of how nothing happens and when it does is inconsequential. Other than this one - important - detail, I liked the movie.Therefore I urge you to tweak the story in your heads when you watch the film. Consider all witchy things hallucinations of the people involved. Then you will find some meaning in the whole thing.P.S. for some reason I couldn't stop thinking of the video for KillSonik - Slaughterhouse, so that may have thrown me off a bit, too :)",8,0,3,1 July 2016
The Holiday," A bit of everything, mostly bad
","The ending was better than the start, so I rate it just below average. The thing is that some parts were nice, others brilliant, while most of it was boring and unbelievable.To start with the beginning, two women who don't know each other decide to swap houses without even meeting each other. Is that even possible? Anyway, they both have complicated love lives they want to escape from, one being British, the other American. Now here is a great opportunity for humour, but there was little or none of that.To continue, the stories of both women are completely separate. It's like there are two movies into one (which partly explains why they made this film 130 minutes long!). The situations in both movies are partly interesting, partly clich√©, but most of the script is boring or completely unbelievable. It's very hard to relate to any of the characters.To end it, I think that Eli Wallach and Dustin Hoffman made this film. Yes, Dustin Hoffman plays in this one with a role he couldn't have failed, since it involved one cameo line. It's not like the other actors did not play well, it's just that the script was awful in some places and the embarrassment of trying to place themselves into a bad role was obvious. Frank Black in a romantic role? At least we didn't have him belly dance in his underwear in this one.Bottom line, it is a shallow film. It brushed past so many interesting themes like Anglo-American interaction, old movies, movie soundtracks, movie trailers (yes, it seems most movie professions were present in this one!), the golden age of movies... All that remained was two confused couples spending New Year's Eve together. Can one destroy a (potential) romantic movie more with something more than make it also a Christmas movie?So, my suggestion (strangely it makes me sad to say it) is to avoid this film. Great potential, horrendous delivery!",6,0,3,14 April 2007
Zero Dark Thirty," It's like Homeland was made into a movie
","Kathryn Bigelow again tries to depict the realities of modern warfare against terrorism with this film that looks remarkably like a movie adaptation of Homeland. The same feisty female CIA agent that is 'her against the world', the same obsession with her target, the same great cast placed in somewhat insignificant roles to make her shine in her role. Is it something more than that, though? Barely.On the other hand it is difficult to tell this story and also make it interesting without forgoing some of the realities in it. CIA work is a thorough, heart wrenching and, most of the time, boring job. The movie is likewise in its depictions of torture in the hands of Americans, numerous bureaucratic obstacles before action is even considered and the many discussions. As an idea, the operation for the capture or killing of UBL was not started for more than 100 days from the moment they suspected where he was.Bigelow does well to not go into a political direction or another. You don't feel the movie accusatory against the War against Terror, nor do you feel it apologetic towards the less politically correct actions of Americans in the conflict. It feels real and I certainly hope it is based on facts. That's why this is not a very dramatic movie, nor has it a lot of military action, it is almost a documentary.Bottom line: As a depiction of facts, a great job; as a movie, a little boring. And I also don't know about the veracity of the information Bigelow received as source material.As for what happened in the film, the operation itself felt weird to me. They go there to kill bin Laden. Just kill him. Not detain, not prosecute, not torture and interrogate. Bin Laden himself, in the midst of an obvious American attack, doesn't blow up the entire compound, or at least himself, he just sits tight and waits for it all to end. He could have just hidden somewhere in a compartment and the Americans would never have had the time to do a proper search. None of that happened.One phrase in the film also left me wondering. Apparently, the reasoning behind sending the team in the house in the first place was to ascertain that bin Laden really was there. Otherwise they would have just thrown in a bomb. Really? Is that justice? It's seems like American Fatwa to me. And this is the most terrifying thing to me, how a few bombs and terror threats have sand blasted away the patina of civilization from the American behavior and showed the angry, barbaric desire to dehumanize and destroy their enemy, just like the people they are fighting. I think that is the meaning of the last scene: the girl, having reached her target, cries for her own lost humanity.",8,0,4,3 March 2013
War of the Worlds," Aliens want to kill Tom Cruise. No, they are not from Europe.
","I think everybody that voted here gave this movie a 7. It was everything it was supposed to be, nothing more, nothing less. We all know (or at least heard of) the book of H.G.Wells, the aliens come, they wreak havoc, then they die.The performance of Tom Cruise was a bit of a surprise, I mean, we all know he is a capable actor, he just shows it so rarely. In this movie I think he caught the essence of his character very well. Maybe it was a good casting choice and good directing, but I choose to believe it was Tom Cruise's merit. Thumbs up for him.The differences between this movie and the 1953 one are more realistic human behaviors and, of course, cool special effects. Also, I thought it was interesting to change the classic couple in distress with a single dad and his children. I came to regret that thought when the girl child kept alternating between annoying shouting and annoying silences. How a father could have loved that one is a story in itself.To me it seemed that the movie borrowed from Mars Attacks. It felt funny to see influences from a parody of such movies into such a movie. Some of the things in the movie were really misplaced, though. The video camera working where all the electrical devices had stopped (as well as mechanical watches, a tribute to the original movie, but lost without any explanation or continuation, for example. I didn't like to see Tim Robbins in such a secondary role, which he played great, like always. I hated those brats with every fiber of my being and I actually felt sorry to see that the boy survived. I thought that the idea of the machines being buried in the ground then 'manned' by teleported aliens was silly. It was much more logical to assume that the machines were teleported into the ground or something like that. How can one take the undertaking of invading Earth, burring killer machines (beneath cities?!), and not do a bio study? I didn't like Morgan 'The Voice' Freeman doing just two audio bits for the movie. Give the man a role! Change the script!I liked Tom Cruise and the attempt to show a little mars forming of Earth. I liked the effects, sort of. They are not fantastic, don't expect too much, but I thought they were OK. It's OK to watch. Independence Day with a little brain on top. Unfortunately, that's a precious commodity these days.",7,1,4,5 July 2005
Love Actually," Lovely English humour, Notting Hill part 2
","This is one of those movies to cuddle with someone and watch with. There is that atmosphere of ordinary people leaving ordinary lives, yet being extraordinary in their take of things (and in their accent, of course). All those people that enjoyed Notting Hill will enjoy this one, maybe even more.The cast is full with good actors, starting with Alan Rickman and ending with Liam Neeson. You have celebs like Claudia Schiffer showing unexpectedly. You have personal drama and bliss (sometimes put together). But what is delightful is the humour of it all. Perhaps the Brits will do a dozen films like this one and I'll get fed up with their joking style and I'll write different reviews, but for me it was funny. Really funny. And not in the 'Ha Ha' sense that we see on the Hollywood conveyor belt.I think that the attack on the British Premier was not that subtle, but then again, I doubt he gets anything else. There was the whole design of the stories with a lot of different characters coming together for the end that was nice. did I mention this is also a Christmas movie? And a good one, for once.Have a go at it, why don't you? It is a good movie.",8,0,2,13 August 2005
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," Romantic American Pie?
","It wasn't a bad movie, but it felt like an artificial construct. The indie rock backdrop with no real music behind it, the cardboard characters including the dorky but good looking nice guy, the bitchy ex, the gay best friends and the pristine new girl, the New Yorkish set. I mean, wth? You can have real romance without resorting to some reinvention of the high-school drama.Overall it was OK to watch, not good, not bad. I would have loved to see an original and smart romantic movie be it even a comedy, but this was not it. I rate it completely and utterly average. The bitchy ex was hot, though.",7,0,0,28 March 2009
30 Days of Night," This is a good vampire horror! Yes, we can!
","The movie is not a complete masterpiece, but it is damn close. It features cool vampires attacking an isolated town, people fighting for their lives, scenes with actual emotional impact and lots of blood. Oh, and Melissa George!Somehow I have missed this movie when it appeared so I watched it back to back with the sequel that appeared in 2010. Man, were they completely different! If this film made me immediately jump to the computer and start the sequel to see how it continues, the other made me watch it in fast-forward.The film gets a little of that Swedish movie L√•t den r√§tte komma: the vampires are human-like, but not human; they are strong and fast and deadly; they do not glitter, wear fashionable clothing or have other interests than drinking your blood. In a sense it is similar to Near Dark as well.Bottom line: There are holes in the plot and it doesn't really try to create a vampire mythos at all. But that is a good thing, as it adds to the gritty, visceral feel of the movie. It is the proof that vampire movies can be good! Therefore my recommendation is that you should not miss this film, but definitely avoid the Uwe-Boll-like sequel from 2010.",9,31,47,19 December 2010
Wedding Crashers," Not so great, but not bad
","This movie is not perfect as a romantic comedy, as the romantic part is really insignificant. Nor is it a guys comedy, because the wedding crashing bit is only shown in the start of the movie and then discarded as a non popular activity. It's not bad as a comedy, but I didn't laugh at it.Vince Vaughn is a hyperactive as ever, Owen Wilson is... Owen Wilson. The same calm humor and wacky face, Rachel McAdams is incredibly cute, while Christopher Walken is playing a tiny role that doesn't bring him justice. He is not psychotic in this movie, though. Not too much :)There is no reason for me to go over the plot, it's as predictable as they ever were, but the bad thing about the movie is that it is composed of three major parts that have little to do with each other. First we meet these guys, ready to go uninvited to weddings and prey on the brides maids, then they go the THE wedding we go into 'Meet the Parents' mode, then they are 'discovered' and we go into the part where they feel sorry about what they did and regretful and stuff, then happy ending. And that's it.Conclusion: it's a relaxing comedy (read no brainer), a tad to long (2 hours), and slightly romantic.",6,0,0,3 November 2005
There Will Be Blood," Stupendously abysmally horrendously boring!
","If Daniel Day Lewis would not have played this role as a titan of the screen, I would have abandoned watching the movie from somewhere at the first hour. Instead, I watched all 2 hours and 40 minutes of complete and utter nothingness!Let me dispel some misbeliefs that you might have. If you think this is like a darker Dallas, where oil competitors are outsmarting each other, think again. There is nothing smart in the behaviour of the characters and almost no killing. Is it some gory piece of Scarface mutilation? Not at all.All that this movie is doing is showing how one man is slowly creating an oil company from nothing, while losing any humanity he might have had. You may know the type, smallish angry people that care less about their own success than about the lack of success of others. You will be watching this man for 160 minutes and start wishing for that darn blood!Bottom line: you will look at the screen and scream 'what the...?'. My advice, don't watch it.",6,1,4,21 July 2009
Joker," Phenomenal acting. Joachim Phoenix can make even Gotham feel sad
","I don't think it is a coincidence that Robert de Niro was an actor in this movie. Joker plays more like Taxi Driver than any movie I've seen. The same slow descent into madness for a disillusioned and ignored man at the edge of society.I didn't find the film political at all. Because what Phoenix did I felt for his character at a visceral level, beyond good, evil and morality. The entire movie is a joke that only some people get it. The incel thing, for example, was hilarious in retrospect: frightened first worlders trying to instantly put a label on the people that they feared most and needed support more. The exact same reaction as portrayed in the film. The story in this is very personal, in a social context that becomes a constant buzz that fades in the background.If there is any word that could describe Joker is uncomfortable. It's two hours of feeling the suffering of the main character, even as he breaks and does unconscionable things. You can't not root for him. You can't condone it. You can't not be sad. And in the end, when I was thinking this is a great movie but has nothing to do with the DC comics, it ties in the Batman classic storyline with such ease that I couldn't help shivering thinking on what Batman's story would be in this universe of burning sadness.Bottom line: great acting and really fresh ideas that work together perfectly. It's a very adult film, though, and not for everybody.",10,7,15,29 December 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," Between brilliant and dumb
","It is difficult for me to rate this film. First of all it is well acted and with decent special effects. The idea is interesting even if not terribly original and the film is well made. However, the movie has the problems commonly associated with 'Groundhog Day' movies: it has to show you the repetition in time of certain events, even if you got the idea from the first two shots. All the time paradoxes are, again, an issue in cases like this. Then it has the problems commonly associated with invasion movies: aliens are immensely powerful, but childish in their intelligence, feral and inhuman and impossible to communicate with in a decent manner and they also have some common source of their power which can be destroyed so they would be defeated. Don't worry, I am not spoiling anything, you know everything I just wrote from the first quarter of the film, but you still have to watch the rest of the film to actually see it.So, in conclusion, a well made film that brings almost nothing new to the table. Based on the level of the details that you like, you can make the story into a small episode in a series, a movie or an entire season of something, however the basic premise and what you effectively learn from it remains the same. It left me with a strange feeling because I both enjoyed it pretty much, but I also got that nasty clich√© feeling all the time while seeing it.I recommend it, but don't expect too much.",8,0,2,14 June 2014
Downfall," Wonderful movie, should have been done a long time ago
","I avoided watching the film because I knew it was really laden with political and ethical significance. Even as a watcher of a film I shunned the responsibility of having to face it, so how could I possibly accuse the people that took part of all of it?The movie, a German two hour and a half marathon of humanity 'falling down', depicts not only the last delusional day of Herr Hitler, but also that of his closest people, bystanders and young soldiers. It is based on two books, written based on witness accounts of what happened. You need to watch stuff like that in order to understand that even the worse people have been human and had a good side and dreams and connections, but also to understand how the best people get caught in it too, probably because of these same human connections and feelings of loyalty and respect.What I find disgusting is that movies like these only appear a long time after they can do any good. After half a century of Nazi demonizing, when most of the people involved have died, we muster the courage to admit that Hitler was human, too, and that he and his staff were not a bunch of psychopathic evil monsters; they had ties directly to our very nature. Perhaps in a few decades we will get movies depicting terrorists as human, too, and we will wonder on how delusional they were, but still loved their friends and their spouses and their children. A movie that would probably not help anyone still fighting or trying to come to terms with the consequences of terrible acts, because it would be so much time after the fact.What jumps in one's face, again and again, from this movie, is how the cocoon around Hitler, just as with so many other maniacal leaders, left him completely disconnected from reality and from the people around him. We get to understand that the same connections that caught so many people in the tide of Nazism also make a monster from the one that chooses or is forced to sever them. Any possible respect for Hitler vanishes immediately when confronted with the image of a crazy old man, ready to let the entire German nation perish, rather than face his own failure.I would make this film a movie to be watched by children. Not for them to become the subjects of Godwin's law, but to see that human interactions in the inner circle of the Third Reich were no more or less special than the way children relate to each other and their parents. And even if we feel disgust for the people that played strategy games with real people, but were never in the harms way, we have to see those willing to fight for the paternal image of the Fuhrer, the party, God, freedom, or whatever mass delusion they just love to submit to.This film shows - as so many should have, but chose to parody reality for a quick buck - that 'Never again!' doesn't mean not killing people in concentration camps or drawing swastikas, but not falling in these oh so human and easy to miss traps of character. The little things, the ones that should become apparent before they turn into monstrosity.It also shows how good German actors and cinematography really are. Good job! The only issue I had is with the length of the film. True, it would have been impossible to compress the horror in less time, but some watchers might be ill accustomed to watching something for such a long period of time. Even if you find it difficult, please do try. It is worth it.",9,3,5,4 November 2013
Whiplash," Interesting take on the classic story of getting through by effort
","You've seen this before, usually in sports movies, where some guy or girl is set to get through some very difficult competition and works their ass off to make it. Whiplash is not really about the finishing competition, but about the mindset of the person wanting to 'get there' and of the teacher who needs to find a prodigy to validate their own efforts. Most of all, the film is extraordinary for making the viewers ask themselves if there is a line and when can you consider it crossed, in both pupil and teacher.Other than that, though, I felt that the movie was close to mediocre. J.K. Simmons seems to have won the Oscar as recognition for all his acting jobs, because I can think of several actors of the top of my head that could have played the same role. It wasn't such a difficult role, not compared to the one Miles Teller played, at least. He did all the drumming scenes himself and 40% of the drums in the soundtrack are him playing.The ending, of course, is epic and the 'training montages' are pretty convincing of the will of the music student, but the music does not convince me. I am not into jazz, but I've scoured the 'net and it's not either a spectacular style of music and even the musical references are not that accurate.Bottom line: could be inspiring, but I rather appreciated it for the guts to make the viewer consider boundaries, for them and others, in the teaching process, rather than for any spectacular acting or scripting. Worth a watch, surely.",8,1,3,1 October 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Even when you have everything, you still want more
","It is difficult to watch a movie that you absolutely know how it will end. Scorsese is known for casting Leo diCaprio as the young energetic underdog that gets the world, only to lose it wholesale. The other movies of this sort, though, were interesting because they featured the criminal underworld or some other bizarre and exotic environment. The Wolf..., in comparison, is a movie about spammers and thieves that get drunk and high all the time in order to keep up with their own fantasies about their lives. Really, you could make it about Romanian hackers and it would have been a much better and fun film, with the same general ideas.Even worse for this three hour movie, Matthew McConaughey appears in a tiny role at the start of the film and explains it all: you don't want to make money for the client, you want to keep him betting on stocks, getting fabulously rich - on paper, while you get hard cash from commissions. The basic trade that we are supposed to empathize with is phone spamming and conning greedy and uninformed clients.The money that gets generated for the stock traders 'more than we knew what to do with' doesn't go into 'diversification', doesn't go into growing the people that until then were hungry bastards looking to pay their mortgage, it isn't invested into anything. It just goes on expensive cars, yachts, prostitutes, drugs and trophy wives. And while I admit many people would sell their soul to get to the point where they can do that, the outcome of such a behavior is obviously not good if that is all you do.And I am not being moralizing here. Hell, screw the bitches and snort the dope, but do something with yourself, plan for when the money will not be so good, make sure you will never get screwed over by technicalities, government agents, false friends or accidents. Instead the characters in the film act like there is no tomorrow. Literally they behave like the end of the world is around the corner. For three hours. It quickly gets old.There is some value in the ending, when DiCaprio's character is terrified he is going to get to jail, only to discover than when you have money, it isn't that bad at all, but other than that I just wanted to see the film end. There is no cat and mouse game with the FBI, nothing comes as a surprise, it just goes on and on with how wonderful it is to have enough money to spend it stupidly when you earn it by praying on people even more stupid than yourself.Bottom line: while DiCaprio makes a good role - after all, he is a damn good actor - the film itself is only mildly entertaining. Considering it is based on an autobiographical book, you might forgive the film for being too real and too boring, but there is still the matter of why someone would choose to make a movie on such a material. I watched the film with two other people and they were both awed by the opulence depicted in the film and the comparison of their own lives to that of the protagonists. I guess there is that; learn that if you are ingenious enough, hungry enough, you can make yourself have all the money in the world. Perhaps Scorsese wanted this, or perhaps he missed the point with me, because all I felt when the film was over is that I am happy with my life and I am glad the movie finally ended.It is interesting to read about Jordan Belfort, that's a real person. Also, his story is told in another movie from 2000, called Boiler Room, with Giovanni Ribisi and Vin Diesel. Might be worth a look.",7,4,6,3 February 2014
Army of Darkness," Fun fun fun!
","Oh, come on, you just gotta love this. Whether a girl or a snotty old man, this movie is funny. Bruce Campbell overdoes himself into this goofy comedy, transforming scene after scene into a laughing contest. One just has to see this.Seeing the first two movies as well, I think I realize how this one came to be. I think that most of the times artists allow themselves to have fun at their own work, jewels of comedy emerge. I would just love a fourth movie in the Evil Dead series.Funny thing, though, as this is the most successful of the movies, I have seen it quite a few times, on video, TV or my computer. I can vaguely remember that one of the movies had an ending when the guy found himself in a far post-apocalyptic future after getting the potion, while in others he was in a supermarket, attacked by a demon. Were there two endings to this movie?=== yup, searched it up in the trivia, it had two endings :)",8,2,3,16 April 2006
It Chapter Two," Stellar cast, great acting, good material
","... but not much else. I may be tired of all the sequels and remakes and prequels and all this regurgitated crap. I mean, we all knew how the story was going to unfold, even if the ending is slightly different and now Maturin is an Native American drug root and Pennywise sprouting spider legs prompts a The Thing reenactment.My point is that the first film was always the better one, even in other adaptations. The children's fear is huge because they are children and their courage is so much more important. Pennywise was barely articulate in the first film, now he is talking and having agents that do his bidding. The rules have changed dramatically. It's not a creature that devours every 27 years, it's one that is rebooted every 27 years. In the first film they were all friends, in this they are adults that have not seen each other in decades. How am I going to feel anything for them, regardless of the quality of the acting?Bottom line: the experience has to be different for people who don't remember the Tim Curry version or that have not read the book. Perhaps waiting a few years and then watching both films back to back offers a different enjoyment level. For me, it was just a better version of something that had already been done and brought nothing new to the table. It was scarier, but somehow it felt less meaningful. And yeah, the ending was always going to suck.",8,0,0,19 January 2020
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," A rather interesting premise, but something off in the presentation
","A young Londoner writer finds an interesting set of people on the island of Guernsey who share some personal stories from the time of the German occupation. Somehow they are all linked by the pleasure of reading books, after they were inadvertently forced to create a book club to justify their meetings during the Nazi regime. But after the initial groan 'Oh, no, not another war movie', it was clear that the action was happening right after the end of War World II. And it was interesting, in a literary way (especially since I had tried to watch Book Club just before and I gave it up) as well as a personal exploration of complex characters and it was generally well acted. However, there was always something slightly off: inadvertences, forced scenes, a romantic subplot that actually made no sense or brought any value to the film. So with much regret, I have to blame the director of the movie and a little bit the script. I don't think the lead actress was very good either, but I have to be picky to blame her for the feeling of uncanny valley while watching the film. If it weren't for this, I would have rated it a lot higher.",7,0,0,15 August 2018
Hancock," I have to under grade this, It cheats on so many levels it's disgusting
","I like Will Smith, he can act like the best of them. but what does he do? He plays superheros and futuristic cops or lonely scientists in doomsday worlds. If it weren't for The Pursuit of Happiness, I would say his career is going downwards.The film itself is a cheat. It has trailers and ads about Will Smith being some sort of disgruntled super hero with a horrible attitude, while some funny looking PR guy is going to great lengths to 'fix' him. Not so in the movie! The whole convincing takes about 5 minutes of film!Then there is Charlize Theron. I mean, OK, it wasn't a role unfit for her, but it felt like the only reason she was in the cast to begin with is some weird 'let's see Smith kiss Theron' thing.And then there is the actual plot. Jeez, what an underachievement. It actually had some very good ideas and they were unexploited, abused and thrashed, giving way to silly special effects and silly dialogs.Bottom line: for presenting itself as an original movie, with a true anti-hero as lead character, and for hiding the real 'jist' of the story in the commercials, I give it a big BOOOOO! Watch it on TV when it comes out!",6,0,2,10 September 2008
Kong: Skull Island," An average movie that didn't actually need Kong
","The film is a combination of good actors doing their best with what they are given, nice special effects and completely no story. Basically, it is about a bunch of people on an alien planet. It would have worked just as well. In fact, it would have worked better to explain an island that mysteriously has a completely different ecosystem than the rest of the world. And I have to say, a sequel to this would REALLY not need Kong at all, just a remake of Verne's The Lost World.There isn't much in the story that isn't spoiled by the trailer. And that's because that's the whole story. In it, Kong is just a big monkey. There are no subtle shots at Hollywood's system as in the original, nor much emotional charge. Half of the film is about the other animals on the island and a quarter about how crazy Sam Jackson's characters can get, so it's not even a movie in which Kong has a leading role. It would have been braver and more sincere to just kill the big ape in the first minutes and then get on with their alien explosions movie.",7,2,2,30 October 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," A clumsy ending
","The Battle of the Five Armies title is a great exaggeration of what an army entails. The movie is about more or less a skirmish with some rather imaginative weaponry. The plot goes sideways and after two three hours long previous films we get a two hours and a half mess that is half completely over the top battle scenes and the other half people talking out of their asses. It is pure chaos, where orcs are either mighty unbeatable beasts bred for war or cardboard armor wearing morons easily defeated by fishermen's wives and children, as the action demands. Things start to remind of Pirates of the Caribbean, and not only because it's the same actor doing kind of the same stuff. There is even a prolonged ending with Bilbo Baggings returning to the Shire, almost as if wanting to undo the good idea in the Lord of the Rings movies in which they removed the boring book ending with Saruman taking refuge in the Shire, and that portrays hobbits as petty bureaucratic creatures, rather than kind and resilient and courageous as declared everywhere else in the films. If I enjoyed the first two movies and wanted to see how it will all end, the third was a ridiculous failure, trying to do too much with too little: making a country brawl look like an epic battle, keeping the lighter more children oriented tone while killing characters and trying to express deeper heroic emotions, trying to somehow raise on the same level three organized military groups and a bunch of fishermen and animals and tying up lose ends that were there only to make this a trilogy rather than a pair of decent movies. It is now when all the jokes about the eagles made in good fun in the first two movies (and in Lord of the Rings as well) turn smirky, when the only logic to the plot and action seems to be the panic of production companies trying to achieve their financial goals rather than tell a good story. It is here where the disappointment that everyone talks about when referring to The Hobbit movies raises its ugly head and grows on the small mistakes of the previous two movies. So in order to enjoy the trilogy, one must somehow detach themselves from the ending and see it as an imperfect finish to an otherwise fun movie, maybe imagine their own.",6,2,2,25 December 2017
Shooter," You don't understand, they killed his dog!
","All these other people commenting on IMDb missed the whole point. It's not about the rightness of it, justice or hurt feelings... this is about a guy's dog. You kill my cat and I'll come after you, guns blazing.Other than that, very impressive shootings, but in a rather naive and cardboard setting. You know the type: bad is bad, good is good and lots of bad people die, while the good guy slips through hails of bullets. I would really love a true sniper movie, but alas, I don't think snipers are into movies much, so everybody guesses. To see a whole villa not exploding from a simple burst gas line would be good, too.Anyway, the movie is exactly what it says it is: it's about a shooter. He does the shooting all movie long, then the film ends. I like Mark Wahlberg, I think he has proved his worth as an actor, he just needs better roles. Bottom line: average, yet not disappointing movie.",7,0,3,29 July 2007
Inception," A Matrix of dreams
","After the first Matrix movie was released, there was this consistent rumour that predicted the Matrix itself was a simulation in a deeper Matrix still. Inception is like that rumour was translated into a movie, only without Agent Smith. What can I say... there are turtles all the way down. The casting of Leo de Caprio is funny to me. Just after a movie where we've explored his subconscious, we go deeper. The movie starts with him on a beach, too.But let me tell you about the movie. It is very well done, the tension is palpable and the effort that went into creating the dream worlds is top notch. I am not talking about computer effects only, but also about entire action scenes that reminded of Matrix just a little bit too much. While the idea (ahem) of the film is simple enough, its implementation navigates in a labyrinth of subconscious worlds, several levels deep. I only wish the first half would have been clearer, without so much chasing and shooting. The action scenes were good, but almost irrelevant to the plot.Bottom line: expect something a bit vague, that you must not strive to understand right away or, indeed, make total sense. It is a good idea which was put well in a movie. Oh, and Ellen Page is not completely annoying in the movie either. A cast that was too good for the roles many of them got, with episodic appearances by legends such as Michael Caine, Pete Postlethwaite or even Tom Berenger. This quickly washed away my disappointment of Lukas Haas' short role. The movie was good, but a religion? Not a chance. Stick to simpler psychological archetypes like a Messiah fighting a supercomputer to push that one.",9,0,7,7 November 2010
Murder on the Orient Express," A fundamentally passive experience, unlike a whodunit should be
","Of course, there is the matter of the source material, which couldn't have been changed significantly. However, I am here to argue that this movie was a failure for meeting none of the expectations it created.First, as a murder mystery, it should have allowed for enough evidence for a viewer to solve the case. Instead, every time Poirot made a leap, he was using information we didn't have, that he was aware of apriori of the events in the film.Second, there is the issue of the great cast. You expect something like this to not be much in the way of story, but that it would shine on the strength of the actors:Kenneth Branagh, Johhny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, Pen√©lope Cruz and so many others. Instead, we get a bit of each, a bit theatrical, a bit over the top in some cases, even a few moments that really felt fake (although in hindsight, if the actor is playing someone who is lying, maybe they did well?), but nothing shiny. No depth of character, no emotional buildup, nothing. The absolutely best scene comes from Willem Dafoe, at the end, completely ruined by the blunt interpretation of Pfeiffer a few moments later. Branagh's obviously fake mustache had more screen time than any of the stars in that great cast.And third, there was the story. A violent act that causes much pain is explained mostly through Poirot's description and fractured images that are supposed to make the viewer understand. Yet there is no transition from there to the present. We don't care about the event, the characters and we are completely unaware of how everything fits and how people got to this point. As a result, other than Poirot's intense stare and the nice stage sets, there is no story. I had more fun watching the introduction of the detective than in all of his solving of the train case.Bottom line: For what it attempted, it failed at every step. For what it promised, it failed to deliver. With pain in my heart I can say that this was substandard.",6,0,5,18 February 2018
Lord of War," A very good movie for its class.
","This is a movie about Nicholas Cage being a weapon merchant. He is doing business with the most atrocious dictators and tyrants in the world and he has no regrets, because he is actually good at it. As a technical guy, I can relate to that. Ethan Hawke makes a remarkably small role in this movie as the idealistic Interpol agent.What is nice about Lord of War is that it shows that a man can do wrong things without actually meaning harm as well as doing harm without doing the wrong things. What is not nice is that is shows a birds eye view of something that is anything but comfy and something to feel good about. It's similar to that scene in Syriana where the rookie Intelligence officer is destroying a car with a missile by using a joystick in the CIA headquarters. Is that the world view of Americans, I wonder?In rest, it is a well done movie, worth seeing, and maybe even able to start some discussions about the nature of morality.",7,1,2,6 February 2006
Sherlock Holmes," Cyberpunkish Sherlock
","I expected the movie to be exactly the way it was, so I can't rate it higher or lower than average. Set as a prequel to most of the book Sherlock Holmes adventures, it features a physically active Holmes, with a just as sporty Watson, fighting the powers of darkness that infect a masons like secret order in order to control England and then the world. At least they were not teenagers...Was it too far fetched? A little, but the books were also a mix of mystery and cat and mouse games. Was the movie too flashy in its special effects? Yes, and so rendered the fabled deduction capabilities of Sherlock Holmes as nothing more than parlour tricks. His sense of smell was more prevalent in the film than his thinking. Was it entertaining? Sort of, but never over the top.Bottom line: if they would have cut short on the steam age supertechnology and the action sequences and made the script a little more involving, it would have been a much better movie. As such, it remains a silly action film in the same league as Indiana Jones, entertaining, but never engaging.",7,0,0,25 January 2010
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," Hard, good war drama.
","It seems no matter the nation or ideology, you put a bunch of men together and madness occurs naturally. In this movie, the horror, but most of all the stupidity of war is made obvious, while telling the story of two brothers forcefully drafted into the army and that are trying to survive taking care of each other.The movie is very well made, even the special effects, the actors play very nice, even the extras, while the story itself is captivating and emotional. After watching this movie you will probably hate war with all your heart.There is no point in revealing the plot. In itself it is not very surprising and the big story is pretty clear from the beginning. The details, though, make this movie and I highly recommend it to people of all ages. Some scenes are too theatrical, but they are only an exception.The only warning I give is that this is a rather long movie and being highly military it will probably annoy or bore the average woman. Try watching it by yourself or with the guys. It is worth every minute.",8,4,5,10 January 2006
WALL¬∑E," Short circuit in space
","I thought it was a beautiful piece of animation. And that's about it. The creators clearly inspired themselves from Short Circuit (the robot is practically the same design and the cute comic relief robot is called Mo, although it might be a coincidence) and made a love story between two robots in a time where humans are only fat blobs waiting to be served and completely dependent on machines.How believable was it? Zero. Did it matter? No. But it bothered me that behind the nice animation all the story was an emotional 'aaaaaah, so cute' extended to movie length. The few moralistic conclusions of the whole humans-become-vegetables idea were lost in an avalanche of positive (and meaningless) hope.Bottom line: great for kids, I guess. Funny for adults. You'll forget about it the next day.",7,0,6,26 October 2008
The Good Shepherd," An actor centered movie
","A common mistake actors turned directors make is to do films that focus on the acting, on the performance of the individual actor, rather than the story. This is a long two hours and a half of exceptional acting, but when it ends you end up asking yourself what the hell was that all about. Even if the subject is based on a true character and the approach is realist enough, the film is very hard to watch without getting bored. But it is a very good film, nonetheless.A great thumbs up to Matt Damon, I think he deserves an Oscar for this, even if other actors would have played this role a lot more easily than, I guess, he did. The film itself shows actors to be very old. It spans 22 years or more and the young become old and older actors like Robert de Niro and Joe Pesci look ancient. Can you remember the guy that plays a few scenes as an old Mafia boss playing in Home Alone? Geez, time passes quickly.Anyway, a lot of good actors played in this movie, but that doesn't mean they had roles to match. Angelina Jolie plays the 'got me a husband by getting pregnant' role, quite well I would say, but she isn't very center stage. Joe Pesci, Robert de Niro, William Hurt, Timothy Hutton, they all played a few scenes in the movie. This is not a one man film, but it is damn close to one.Bottom line: it is worth a watch, but you must be in the mood. Not a popcorn and laughs film. It portrays the boring and dangerous life of a top CIA director. You must bear with it, there is no catch in the end, it's a descriptive movie.",8,1,2,30 January 2007
Arrival," First Contact meets The Sphere, via Melancholia?
","This is one of those films that will clearly divide people into two categories, the ones that love it and the ones that.. err.. meh it? I, unfortunately, fall into the second category. It was a beautifully crafted movie, with great acting, yet it made me feel almost nothing and I left the theater without learning anything new.So is it a waste of time? Certainly not. Amy Adams does a great job of portraying the aloof linguist that is called to communicate with aliens and the visual design of the film is quite pleasing. The gimmick is also interesting, and I am not going to spoil it here.The problem is that the film is based on a short story and it shows. Other than the mood and the acting and the gimmick there is nothing else but empty atmospheric space. Reminded me of Melancholia that way, another movie that I absolutely hated but many said was wonderful.So, bottom line: clearly better than average, but is it a masterpiece and the best film of the year? Err.. no. Also, I have it on good authority that the short story is less confusing and more fluent than the movie, which is strange, considering it is short.",8,1,6,14 November 2016
Parasite," A good movie, but not Oscar worthy
","If you consider the Oscar as a prize for movie making quality and not a political sham, then Parasite did not really deserve the highest praise. However, it was a good movie. Everyone acted really well and the underlying social commentary that is so common in Boon Joon Ho's movies was very strong while telling the story of a family of poor people who scam their way into the employ of a rich family and start leeching of it. The divide between the rich and arrogant upper class and the very poor is made obvious by this dark movie with occasional comedic undertones.Bottom line: movies about poor people scheming to get money fast are too common in Romanian cinematography. Probably that is why this movie didn't really impress me too much. It is a good movie and very well made, but the story was just... meh.",8,2,10,13 February 2020
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Why don't I have any self respect? You're an actor, honey!
","This was a full film. It had the story, the characters, the little nods and subtle hints throughout the experience and also a level of self-reference and breaking the fourth wall. Also great acting and cinematography. People really loved making this movie and it shows.I won't talk about the subject much, as it has been talked to death. It's about actors, plain and simple. Michael Keaton plays really well a washed out actor who used to act as a superhero in a famous movie. He steals the show, so to speak, yet I didn't feel the story was about him, but about actors in general, perhaps all people, as actors are caricatures of real men and women. For me the scene that defined the film was the one where Naomi Watts' character goes back to her dressing room, humiliated by her actor boyfriend on stage. When she was a little kid, she wanted to be an actress. And now, that she was playing on Broadway, she still felt like a little kid.Perhaps it is just a gimmick, a movie about actors made by actors for other actors. It feels intelligent, but maybe it is not. However, when viewed as a metaphor for all lives, people locked in their performances, trying to reconcile their self image with what other people see, negotiating their dreams as they fade into nothingness, it did impact me greatly.A bit boring at times, it is two hours long, but mostly it is brilliant.",9,3,8,19 April 2015
Centurion," Great quality per buck ratio
","The movie is clearly a low budget one, from the moment the film starts with a map of Roman Empire Brittania appearing from the mist while a deep voice explains what goes on to the mostly unknown and smallish cast. But they did a great job with what they had!The plot did not go in the direction I would have wanted - I believe an opportunity for a great strategic guerrilla warfare film was missed here - but it worked well, nonetheless. Pict tribes decimate a Roman legion and the few survivors run for their lives. A bit too much running, and to not much avail. And did the story really need the good caring blonde?The acting is very good, the landscapes fantastic, the atmosphere well done and the battles really bloody. It works perfectly as an action film, well as a historic dramatic depiction and kind of fails as a romance. Full thumbs up for movies that are well done by people who care about the film they make!",8,6,14,13 September 2010
The Big Short," You don't want to hear it, but you have to
","I am rating this movie a full 10 because there was nothing wrong with it at all. It has a lot of technical jargon, but they explain the relevant stuff - even breaking the fourth wall - so that anyone can understand what they are talking about. And what they are talking about is that the entire world economy is a big giant self serving fraud.The amazing cast of the film is not only great at acting, but clearly motivated by the subject of the movie. People like Steve Carell that are acting all seriously and angry, people like Christian Bale playing the role of a semi-autistic number cruncher, people like Brad Pitt and Ryan Gosling in secondary roles with a lot of - basically - cameos from actors that clearly want to make a statement.The statement is at the end, when one banker from Swiss is the only one who is put in jail, while people are bailing out the banks that started and continued this disgusting system, while losing their jobs and houses in the process.But more than that, I loved the way the movie was created. It is a well done movie, from script to editing and soundtrack. I loved the scene where for dramatic purposes two guys find a very important information on the ground, discarded and ignored, then one turns to the screen and says 'it didn't actually happen like this, but like that' and then they go on.Watch it. You will not understand most of what they are talking about, but it is not necessary. You will not want to hear it, because it sounds fantastic, but it is real. Unfortunately, you also have nothing you can do about it.",10,7,9,7 February 2016
The Conjuring," I am pretty sure you've seen this film before
","The fact that the cast and the name are different does not change the situation. You've seen this film before. Whether it was 'The Exorcism of (enter name here)' or something else in the range of supernatural possession or even alien abductions, the plot is the same: family moves in the middle of nowhere for no good reason, bad things start happening, a team of 'specialists' come to the rescue and the movie ends with a 'based on a true story' line.For me The Conjuring was slightly different because the film was recommended to me by a friend who pointed out the subtle camera work and the good old fashioned scares. So that leaves me in a dilemma: do I appreciate the movie as a standalone horror, forcing myself to ignore the entire list of similar movies since the 80s till now, or do I denounce this as a shameless clone of so many films of the genre? One has to wonder: if the viewer sees this type of movie for the first time, is it not a good movie if they enjoy it?But I cannot try to judge all of this based on the pleasures of some hypothetical person. I have to rate it based on what I know, and what I know is that I have seen this film before and cloning it does not one an artist make, but a Xerox at most.Bottom line: every single line, every scene, even the effects and camera work, for all of them I had the strong feeling that I have seen them before. And, alas, they also happened exactly as I had predicted minutes before, down to the makeup and sound effects. I can't really appreciate that. I have seen a lot of crappy movies and some of them copies of other crappy films that I have seen before, but each one brought something slightly new: a monster that was different, a situation, a character type. Just enough to make a small difference. The Conjuring brings nothing new to the table, absolutely nothing.",7,0,1,7 April 2014
Prometheus," Beautiful visuals, ridiculous script
","I understand that this was supposed to be an Alien prequel originally, people left it unfinished due to the pathetic movies in the Alien vs Predator universe, then remade it to be independent. That means that at least two scenarists and probably more, read and wrote this script. Then people read it and approved of it. All those people should be fired and preferably destroyed until no biological trace is left of them.Now, you might think it is a dissonance between a grade of 8 and such anger at the scenarists, but it is not that strange. The film is beautifully made, clearly thought out for 3D, not something they added as an afterthought. The aliens are great, the monsters scary and visceral and the atmosphere dark and brooding. It is such a nicely done film that to foul it with such a stupid script should be considered a crime against humanity and dealt with as such.Bottom line: if you have any scientific training or at least a vague idea of what that should be, try to temporarily abandon it before starting to watch Prometheus. Any background in physics, medicine, biology, geology or interface design will hurt your viewing pleasure. Otherwise, a great film. Try not to let its moral 'parents are crap and children a-holes' ruin your day, either.",8,1,5,9 June 2012
The Water Diviner," A technically good film, but fell flat for me
","Russell Crowe is great in this film about personal loss, the horror and futility of war and about friendship that transcends borders and sides. Everything was spot on: acting, directing, sets, editing, soundtrack. Yet it all felt artificial and heavy handed, akin to The Hundred- Foot Journey, if you saw it, albeit with a completely different subject.There was some interesting commentary about why people fight in wars and what they feel and do when the wars are seemingly over. Also one can learn more about an almost forgotten part of history, when Turkey was still the Ottoman Empire and was fighting Australians and New Zealanders, then Greeks while the British were lording around. But the rest... I felt like someone was taking feelings in bulk and throwing them at me, containers and all, like so many brick in one's face.Suffering? We haz it! Stoic hopefulness? Tons of it! Cardboard villains? One for each occasion. Love story that made little sense in the plot, especially at the end? Yup. And so on and so on. If it weren't for Crowe, who acted brilliantly, I would have considered this film a failure. As such, I would have to give it an average rating, although I personally didn't like it.Bottom line: it felt like a movie made by an accountant.",7,2,5,14 September 2015
Wonder Woman," It's a superhero movie, what did you expect?
","I went in with low expectations, therefore I wasn't disappointed. However, if I were to have lent ear to all the reviews and commentaries, I would have been quite annoyed. This is NOT a good movie. I barely rate it average.There were good parts in it, mainly the feminist aspects of the film. Diana is tough, but also a woman, with a strong personal and cultural desire to help, mend, love. Of course, it is taken to ridiculous heights and made completely worthless in the end, when she kills a bunch of people, but still, it was a refreshing, if badly implemented, point of view.Other than that there is a lot of bad characterization, starting with the Amazons and Ares and ending with the three 'sidekicks' that do almost nothing the entire movie. Even the villains are underused, in a movie that somehow managed to total over two hours. There are some scenes that should make the director cower in shame (see the 'they don't know that' scene, ugh!) and some bad acting here and there.Gal Gadot is beautiful, but not an extremely talented actress. She did her best, though. Chris Pine played Captain Kirk, complete with motorcycle and the scene where he stops, thinks a little, then rides another way, plus the obligatory self sacrifice scene. I think it was some sort of tribute, but that part wasn't good in Star Trek either.Bottom line: you can watch it just like you would a Batman or Superman movie and expect just as much. 'The savior of DC franchises' is no worse or better than the things people called disasters before. It is not fun, merely time consuming.",7,5,10,8 September 2017

","I did't watch this movie when it appeared because I've seen the trailer. It was full of special effects and I always thought supernatural and forceful, obvious presence don't work well. But now I had some time and this was the only movie I could have watched so I did it. Some people might like it, I suppose - I do remember some friend or another tell me that 1408 is cool - but frankly I have no idea why anyone would.You see, there is this writer turned psychic investigator who, after the death of his daughter and eventual separation from the wife, does not believe in anything and is looking for haunted places in order to sell '10 haunted (something)' books. Typical setup, he gets an intriguing letter about a haunted room in a hotel.That being said, the beginning was kind of obvious, but not bad. The atmosphere was creepy enough, Samuel L. Jackson had the best role he landed in quite some time and I started hoping. As any long time Hollywood movie watcher could tell you, you must leave all hope before you watch one.Long story short, by the middle of the game I was hoping the ending would be bad, like the character winning over 'the evil room' without any merit, but that it would come soon. It did not, mind you, instead came a false ending, which was pretty obvious because there was quite some time left of the movie, so it didn't work on any level.In the end, the tough supernatural investigator completely caved in (or rather, he gave up from the first minutes when his hand got hurt - awww - but the room took him hostage) and started acting like an insane monkey, leaving the screenwriters to take care of any decency in the ending of the film. And, of course, they didn't even try.Bottom line, the movie stank on so many levels, that I could write a novel (get it?) about how bad it was. At least the acting was good, the production values, the music, just about everything except, of course, THE STORY!",Null,1,2,31 July 2011
Taken 2," As expected, Liam Neeson kills everything
","The end of the world has come. It is Liam Neeson. Some misguided Albanians bring a small army to Istanbul in order to capture the man who killed the Albanians in the first movie. In doing so they upset security expert Bryan Mills and try to harm his family. He does 'what he does best' in the capital of a mythical Turkey which is decades behind the civilised world and borders Albania, somehow.Now, I didn't expect anything that what I got. Liam Neeson is great in the role of the obsessive dad and thorough killer. Every bullet is shot straight, every move is thought through and completely deadly. The action is great even if the specifics are pretty much a fairy tale. In the end, this is what Taken was, it would have been hard to believe the sequel is anything else.Famke Janssen has the worse possible female role: a dead weight that just drags things along, has emotional outbursts and shouts 'no' and 'please don't' while her hero is saving her. At least the daughter's role was more active.",7,0,1,22 December 2012
The Woman in Black," Well done Asian horror... by the British
","If you take The Ring, replace the maltreated girl with a desperately insane mother and lose the whole tape/TV connection, you get something really close to The Woman in Black.The film started a little bit like Dracula, with the legal clerk coming to a remote village to put some papers in order. It appears that even ghosts hate lawyers, so it all gets messy really soon. The actors were decent enough and the film spooky, but the thing that bothered me most was the cheap scares: sudden loud sounds, screeching ghosts appearing in reflective surfaces, the really old and annoying 'something moving in my peripheral field of view' and the ending. Not the ending ending, but let's say the few minutes before the ending. It felt so fake.Bottom line: a classic (and by that I mean filled with clich√©s) ghost horror, with Daniel Radcliff finally shedding that Harry Potter adolescent off his casting persona in the lead role. It's not what was in the film that made it average, but mostly what wasn't. So much potential and what they end up doing is an Asian horror with a British accent.",7,0,0,30 June 2012
X-Men: First Class," Really good! It was worth suffering the other X-Men films
","Someone had the idea to cash in the X-Men concept in a series of movies and they did try to follow the comic, adding as much special effects as was computery possible. However, it all backfired when the dated (and often conflicting) general ideas in the graphic novel made the movies little more than casual entertainment. So they did the 'reinventing' trick. Find some smart people and rewrite stuff so that it matches with the past, but removing the ridiculous part. Kind of like changing the Klingons in StarTrek, another perpetually reinvented franchise.The amazing surprise is that they did a good job. The plot is complex, the characters well defined and in the end you are left wanting more, while understanding why everything happened the way it did. A cast of good (but not unnecessarily shiny) actors ranging from James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender to Kevin Bacon and Michael Ironside complemented the well written plot. I even liked the little Wolverine cameo scene, which was funny and subtle, something rarely seen in American movies.Bottom line: I really want more! If they keep up the good work this could really mean a movie renaissance of the X-men idea. Not flashy arrogant super power stars, but people with feelings and complex history behind them and normal except the mutation that is both blessing and curse. In spirit, so much closer to the comic than the other dreadful attempts at putting it in movie form.",Null,1,4,21 July 2011
Fifty Shades of Grey," I kept an open mind. My brain fell out.
","I really tried to see it from all angles. I forced myself to ignore the really weird dialogues, the uncontrollable female gasping at every touch of the guy, the impossibly longing looks shot to the girl or the fact that for any person I know, the behaviour of Grey would have really freaked them out (and I don't mean the sexual practices).But after all that, I just couldn't believe how inconsistent the characters were. Any story has a first goal that absolutely must be achieved, and that is the suspension of disbelief. When the viewer cannot believe things like this can EVER happen (I mean, we believe magic and star ships are OK) then the movie fails. This film has failed.I could not believe a twenty-something virgin can have the confidence necessary to wrap a hot charismatic experienced millionaire around her finger. I could not believe that a guy that needs to dominate women can be so weak and out of control. But worst of all, I could not believe the sex scenes.I understand and acknowledge that women have their fantasies, but the one about the hot single rich stud, domineering and charismatic, who falls head over heels for the virginal girl, then ultimately either submits to her cultural perspective on a normal relationship or gives her the power to reject him is not only spooky, it is offensive.Bottom line: Just like that joke about soft porn being hard porn at half the speed, this two hour long movie is a sort of softer soft porn, at a quarter of the speed. The fact that many critics praised the movie for being a lot better than the amateurishly written book makes female sensuality seem even more terrifying to me that it already was. And it was boring, people! So so boring!",5,2,5,11 April 2015
The Wolverine," They are all so old!
","I liked the movie, even after being spoiled by the trailer which revealed way too much of the plot. A rather typical hero saves girl story instead of a true superhero movie. OK, Logan is invincible and there are some other mutants involved, but most of all it is an action movie about a guy protecting a chick. I also understood where the character came from. What I would call reckless idiocy in any other movie is a typical Wolverine behavior. I also liked the Japanese angle, although too little of their culture was shown and it was too stereotyped.What I noticed most in the film, however, is how old everybody is. Famke Janssen appears as a memory of Jean Grey, you know her - really beautiful - but she got old. Hugh Jackman is full of muscle and manly frowns, but when he needs to run he also needs camera tricks to hide the clumsiness of an old guy running around. And at the end (you have to wait until after the first credits) you get a little scene with Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan hinting that the third Wolverine (or X-Men, or whatever) will be about Sentinels. Both those guys looked ancient. Of course, in order to compensate the oldies, sexy young women were used. And as usual, when in need of a stunningly beautiful female villain, always use a Russian girl. Svetlana Khodchenkova's Viper was a pretty nasty villain; I would have wanted to see more of her.All in all, a fun film, without being overly sci-fi or X-Men related. It seemed a little bit low budget for a movie of this genre, though. Don't expect a cinematic masterpiece and you'll probably enjoy it.",7,0,2,7 November 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Beautifully made film, but a little hollow
","I expected a technological and moral extravaganza, evil Bane, mighty Bruce and sexy women. I got all of that and more. However, the extra I got from the quality of the special effects, the design of the weird flying or road machines and the actors play I lost on the plot.They have tried so hard to make it more that they made something different. Yes, Batman is a workaholic in disguise, obsessed of saving the city of Gotham, yes, Morgan Freeman knows all and, yes, in the end good prevails in a dark world. We already knew that when we started watching the film. All the extra stuff they've put in was just spam. The legend of the Pit, the megalomaniac threat to the city, the people that just stay put because they have no bridge, the ridiculous fighting scenes when Batman is either too weak or too strong and he doesn't use any of the tech to actually help him win the fight, all of these made it feel like I was watching a bad movie blown up to gigantic proportions.The actors. I liked Tom Hardy in the fighter and he made this film, as well. He is clearly a talented actor and this is his rise (see what I did there?). Christian Bale was almost not present in the film. He smiled a little, then cried a little, did some pushups and got screwed by every woman he met. Anne Hathaway has a rather hard to buy role, but she was more than OK and helped make the film seem more complex than it actually was. Gary Oldman was useful, but not really doing anything complicated. As for the others in the full cast of the film, they barely registered.Bottom line: the entire plot is based on characters from the previous movies by Nolan. You should refresh your memory on those before you watch it. The feeling of the film is impressive because they tried very hard to make it so, but all the cool scenes you can watch in the trailer and the rest is a convoluted plot that doesn't make a lot of sense. The film is redeemed by the great quality of its making, meaning well spent big budget, and of the actors play. All in all, an average movie, but fun nevertheless. Oh, and Robin doesn't suck.",7,2,6,20 November 2012
The Croods," Actually, pretty amazing!
","You have to take into account the expectations as well, I mean I was going to watch the film, probably on fast forward, because it is a silly animation movie. I was going to enjoy it for the few scenes that are probably in the trailer as well and call it 'seen it'. Can you, then, believe I never touched the keys from my laptop and watched it all start to end?The film had great animation, even if 3D, an interesting world, with all kind of weird animals that are not real, yet tons of fun, but most of all, a really nice script. It had the usual tricks to make most audience like the movie, in this case the cosy feeling of family love and support and the expected caveman clich√©s, but also subtlety and expression of a whole range of emotions. In a sentence, it made me feel good watching it.The Croods had only eight people in the cast, including for the roles of one small animal and one inarticulate child, and not the most famous ones either, but they did a great job.Bottom line: I may be a sucker for transformative journeys with your entire family movies, but I really enjoyed it. For a Hollywood animation film, it is even more amazing. Or maybe I was just in the right mood. No dirty jokes, no references to other films, emotions that can be enjoyed and understood by small children, but with added subtlety that will entertain adults as well. Watch it.",9,2,3,3 March 2014
Black Panther," Message from the Lion King
","As a fun Marvel Movie, this one is OK. We finally get to explore the hidden, yet very advanced African country of Wakanda, and as we wonder why they do nothing with the power and knowledge they have, the film explores that, too. It's too bad that basically Chadwick Boseman plays a CGI Jacob King and the plot is that of the Lion King. What would Disney say? Well, nothing, because this movie is made by Marvel in collaboration with Disney Studios. Yet we did have to introduce Black Panther before Infinity Wars, so that is why this movie was made.It's not all bad, though. The acting is good, the special effects - barring the fight at the end - are nice, the story makes some sort of sense. The basic outline of the plot, though, is that, in the spirit of unity between men, Wakanda should rise from under its cover and help black people everywhere. Or that, in the spirit of helping the oppressed, it should rise from under its cover and conquer the world. Yeah, neither of those sentences make a lot of sense.Bottom line: fun, better than average, but frankly I would have preferred a spin-off movie with Ulysses Klaue as the main character. Do that, Marvel!",8,5,13,5 May 2018
Iron Man," Amazingly boring
","OK, it's a comic book movie. I got that. Also, they are Marvel comics, so Ari Arad has something to do with it and the main goal is not a cinematic masterpiece. I am also unfamiliar with the comics themselves. So I didn't watch this movie with high expectations, not at all.And still, it bored the hell out of me. Terrorists kidnap the most brilliant weapon manufacturer in the world? He escapes by building a robotic suit instead of the missile the terrorists wanted him to build? And the suit is powered by a battery that he just happened to create while in captivity? Was that the plot of the comic? Because usually even the worst comics have a plot!And then the casting. I like Robert Downey, even if he hasn't acted in anything decent lately. Jeff Bridges? A favourite of mine. Gwyneth Paltrow, yummy! I even like Terrence Howard. And what did they achieve? Absolutely nothing! NOTHING! Not that they played badly, but they just couldn't do anything within the script!What else is there to talk about? The special effects? Some flashy lights and then lots of explosions. Oh, and a flying robotic suit.Bottom line: lousy story to begin with, but scripted even worse. Avoid!",5,1,4,8 July 2009
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Good. And bad. And Ugly. It could have been great.
","The movie felt like a comic book, there is no denying it, for whatever its flaws, the story lines comic book fanatics are nostalgically referring to when criticizing films are no better. The acting was good, the complexity of the story was rare for this time and age, the characters were developed, the music and direction and editing came together nicely.The problems are those of common sense and if you are willing to let go of it, considering it is a comic book movie, you will enjoy it. However little things like an entire drama about piercing the skin of Doomsday when they had just done that a few minutes before, or why Lex hated Superman, or why people did what they did in the manner they did, then switched to a completely different register just seconds after. And of course, matters of physical measures they just play with mercilessly, like the difference between punches, bullets and atomic explosions or how things that have reached outer space fall down relatively in the same spot as from where they left.What personally bothered me were the villains. Turning the smart egocentric genius into a lame psychotic madman and downgrading Doomsday - my favorite guy in the world - to a 3D printed henchman subtracted from what could have been a brilliant story.Bottom line: if you ignore the details, the story is complex and entertaining and if you ignore reality you might even enjoy the lavishly violent action details. Somehow in the middle there is an ugly layer of neglect that just disconnects the experience of the viewer, explaining why some people liked it and some hated it with equal passion.",8,2,7,8 July 2016
Blade Runner," Being a director meant something in the 80's
","Ahh, the 80's, when people could imagine the future as a dark, polluted thing, where people have lost their freedom to corporations. Of course, we now know that this would never happen. *cough*Philip K. Dick has a difficult writing style, something wild in it that makes it hard to grasp, to control. However a lot of his work molds well to the screen and Blade Runner is no exception. What makes the film exceptional, though, is not the pulp mystery feel of the story or the inspiration of the sets and clothes from mid 19th century US or even the excellent acting. Instead it is the attention to detail that Ridley Scott demonstrated when doing it all. This is clearly the work of an obsessive man who saw the film in his head way before it started to make it. This is rare nowadays due to budgets and to the fact that most of popular cinema is not an art anymore, only a business.Watch the film and notice how the characters are not really well defined, leaving room for the imagination, while the sets and the props are clearly very detailed and the world in which the story unfolds makes the characters both gain weight and lose focus. The human condition is actually the main character.Bottom line: a beautifully made film, by a dedicated director, with excellent acting and a story that works on multiple levels at the same time. Rightly considered a masterpiece, you should watch it at least once.",10,3,7,3 August 2014
Casino Royale," It wasn't completely awful, but it stank
","I can't believe how many positive reviews came for this movie. Its only clear qualities are that the film is more on the realist side, rather than weird gadget and eccentric villains, and that they reverted to the good old Aston Martin... but that's it. Craig is a good Bond, but he has nothing from the appeal of Sean Connery or the humour of Roger Moore. But even so, I have nothing against the man. The movie, though, sucked badly! The dialogues are inept, the plot is jerky and ambiguous and the adrenaline inducing effects and action scenes are not that good.All I can say is that we find ourselves in a trend of prequels, and as a prequel, this wasn't particularly good. Taking into account the disastrous recent movies from the Bond series, though, it is a definite improvement.",6,6,9,17 December 2006
Saving Mr. Banks," Spare me the pleasantries
","This was, no question about it, a beautifully made film. Two hours and ten minutes of great acting from all involved. Emma Thompson was brilliant in the role of the obnoxious stuck up old Brit who is really a very sad old Aussie. But then again, it was to be expected; maybe they should make a prize above the Oscars for people that we know are Oscar material and need to go further still. Tom Hanks, an old version of him, is perfect for the role of the gallant Walt Disney, while Colin Farrell plays the role of the drunken dad. Perhaps the Irish actor he should steer away from drunken roles; we all know how Hollywood casting holes are.There is a however, however. The story felt too much like Driving Miss Daisy - you know, old grumpy woman that has a good heart and a story, resilient driver, people that make the effort to 'get her', etc - and I don't know Mr. Disney, but could he have been so nice? It is a story about the weird interaction of interesting and famous people, one that explains, it's true, the creation of a real movie: the Mary Poppins musical movie starring Julie Andrews. But it felt quite a bit fake, I have to tell you.It is noteworthy to say that the film was based on a biography of Travers that also prompted two documentaries that I have not seen. Perhaps more of the truth would lie there, but even from the Wikipedia page for the film I can see that things were not quite like in Saving Mr. Banks.Bottom line: well played, well created, but ultimately a good actor extravaganza on a 'making of' story of an acclaimed American movie. Beautiful, but a bit... surreal?",8,2,5,3 January 2014
Jojo Rabbit," Full of irony and humor, but a bit too predictable
","The film is very well acted. I liked even the little kid. I didn't read anything about the movie and I kind of expected to be a contemporary film about a child with Hitler as an imaginary friend, but no, it's a WWII movie, seen from the perspective of a child. I would put it in the same category as La vita √É¬® bella, but not as good. Sam Rockwell's character was great.The only problem with the film, I believe, is that it quickly became predictable. The imaginary Hitler had no real impact on the story, while the characters quickly fell into familiar cliches: the innocent child, the beautiful Jew, the happy, beautiful, artistic and intelligent parent who makes said child's life wonderful even in the midst of war, the tragic hero, the cardboard evil Nazis. I would have loved a movie about a contemporary American child with Hitler as his imaginary friend, getting him in trouble, but you need balls to do that.As for people who felt 'offended', it's a classic Nazis are bad story. I am still waiting for a true dramatic story of actual Nazis who are also human, without the need for saving Jews. That would be even less offensive, mind you, but you wouldn't get it.",8,0,0,8 April 2020
Beowulf," Finally a great fantasy film. I could have done without the CGI, though.
","If you haven't seen it, you should. It is a brutal hero story, one that does justice to the ways of old (as I can only imagine them), when Christian morality was something that was just emerging in Northern Europe and the glory was that of the warrior heroes, living through and for their skill. The plot is also more like the original Beowulf than most adaptations I've seen. It even beats The Thirttens Warrior (The Death Eaters) in darkness and quality.The CGI, while clearly well done and cool technically, was a bit of a distraction and for that only I was prepared to rate it with an 8. Until I realised who the actor that played Beowulf was and I understood the subtle ploy of the whole computer generated actors. If you don't know who the lead actor is yet, please try not to find out until you finish seeing the film.Bottom line: a must see!",9,2,4,4 April 2008
Live Free or Die Hard," Better than Die Hard 3, lots of action, lots of fun
","I've heard a lot of negative reviews on this, like how unrealistic it is and how the effects are hard to buy and so on and so on. Wake up! It's a Die Hard movie! They really took the effects level to the sky with this one. The subject was kind of ridiculous, I admit, but still, you can't have a good Die Hard without a bad villain.I especially liked Bruce Willises performance as the aging cop, lost in a digital world, but bringing 'it' on in the physical realm. The sidekick also has a larger role.Bottom line: nice action film, a no brainer, but a good one.P.S. Oh, and can you stop casting free running Frenchmen in the next action movies? I get it, parkeur is great. Now stop putting it in all the films.",8,1,4,17 November 2007
Thor: The Dark World," I've got the aether, nothing can stop me now. Oh...
","I can't lie, I enjoyed watching the film. The great special effects, especially at first when the dark elf (yeah, that happened) space shuttles attacked Asgaard, the ridiculously cool Idris Elba, Loki's tricks, Thor's pathetic heroism and Stellan's craziness, the native brutality that Eccleston can radiate with so much ease (screw Doctor Who, I'll just destroy everything, LOL!), they all had something to do with it.But the story was not good, there so many holes in it that Swiss cheese would laugh at it. I don't want to spoil the movie, but in retrospect, Odin's plan was a lot better than what Thor did, not to mention the effect it had in the end. Jane's character is a helpless damsel in distress, although considering the other protagonists, it actually made sense. Thor's friends started cool, but then they ended up less than support characters. Thor himself does nothing but speak with a really deep voice and look pretty. Odin seems fickle and mean, I guess being king of the universe does that to anyone. Renee Russo is a queen, her character made the most sense to me.If one character stole the spotlight, it had to be Idris Elba's. He freaking destroyed an invisible space shuttle by jumping on it and stabbing it! Thor just swung his phallic symbol around. It was nice to see science triumph (after all, it always does) but the mambo jumbo spear like thingies that detect and also cause stuff were really too much.Chris O'Dowd is in this film, too. He is right in his element, as Malekith wanted to restart the universe to fix things, as it were, but has a really small role. Benicio del Toro appears as the mysterious collector at the end (wait until after the first credits to see him). He looks really cool. And if we are to praise the support characters, Zachary Levi looked interesting as the calm gentlemanish swordsman with great skill. Perhaps an offshoot of Thor, featuring Thor's friends rather than himself, would be a good idea, no?Also, after all the credits there is a funny scene with the Gwoemul- like monster that people forgot on Earth. Yeah, kudos if you were wondering what happened to it in the end :)Bottom line: you can make a thousand How It Should Have Ended parodies after this film, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. It hurts to think of the exquisite beauty the graphics people created for a movie that had the story of a fairy tale book for three year olds and how much more coolness a great story would have gotten out of the film. Too bad three year olds seem to be a target demographic for the American film industry. After all, I would rather eat bread than starve, but a steak now and then doesn't hurt, does it?",8,2,3,19 February 2014
Lucy," Scarlett Johansson is a goddess
","Well, we all knew that, but now she has like... abilities. Anyway, my impression of this film is that it is another type of Fifth Element with a sexy chick presented as the greatest and best humanity can become. Like The Fifth Element, Luc Besson writes and directs this story about the aptly named Lucy who accidentally absorbs a superdrug that a Korean cartel is trying to manufacture and sell. She then uses more and more of her brain allowing her to have all these wonderful powers and knowledge.Unfortunately, this is about all that the movie is about and you get that from the trailer. In a way, the trailer is a damned lie, because after you see the premise of the film and some cool scenes, you are tempted to believe that is just a part and the rest of the film would be building on it. It is not. That's about all you get.In fact the Korean mafia and the police and humanity in general become pretty much inconsequential after a while. Morgan Freeman's character appears in about 5 minutes of scenes, the violent murders, fights and car chases are there just as a distraction and Lucy herself, the apex of humanity, does nothing more than use the entire existence as a she would a cell phone, spout some existential things that make little sense and look pretty.Bottom line: If Transcendence really posed some interesting questions about what people would do if granted limitless power, ending with a very philosophical free will choice kind of thing, Lucy is just eye-candy. The only interesting idea in it seems to be that the purpose of life is to share knowledge. Well, there is that, but also another: the elimination of knowledge we don't like. Yet that's another story altogether and probably more interesting than this film.",7,4,10,22 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Not a sequel, but a reboot
","I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the film. Used to Abrams' horrid bastardizing style, I expected something fit for children and devoid of soul. But since I am not a Star Wars fan and Abrams probably is, I found it acceptable and he probably made more of an effort than when he mauled Star Trek, where the situation is clearly reversed.But what is important to understand right away is that this is not really a sequel. They spend as little time as possible tying the other six films with the story, instead focusing on specific nostalgia bringing moments and catchphrases. Other than that they just rehash Episode IV, the original first movie. It starts on a desert planet, the main character is strong with the force and is good with mechanics, the villain wears a mask and is the apprentice of an evil and ugly looking a-hole, it has a Death Star kind of thing, it is destroyed in the last moment, there are a lot of familial ties that are either pushed down your throat for no good reason of hidden away for a big reveal later on. The only thing missing is an Obi-Wan Kenobi type of guy, dispensing with the training or any kind of explanation of what is going on and replacing it with battle and explosions.Therefore, this is a clear reboot. After all Abrams does the same thing, only better because he probably care about Star Wars a little (sorry, still bitter): he takes a franchise, lists all the good and/or nostalgic points that fans love and shoves them all in his new movie, tying it all with duct tape and special effects.I thought the actors were good, including the new Vader, which some thought was too whiny. Excuse me, have you seen Anakin? Anyway, Adam Driver does a very good job of displaying flaring uncontrolled emotion while behaving in a clear psychotic way. He is not just a misguided soul torn by pain and seduced by dark power, he is clearly deranged and he portrays that very well. The new Luke is quite hot and credible, as much as the plot lets her.A disappointment is the character of Finn, who seems to jump from one personality to another with glee, his only role seemingly to bring the plot in the direction wanted, with no consideration to character consistency. I have nothing with the acting, but the character was almost JarJarish in its randomness. Also Luke...Special effects were top notch, including the battles. Gone are the incompetent stormtroopers who can't hit a target sitting in front of them. They are not competent either, but still. The 3D is also done well and didn't just jump on my face for no reason. Also Luke... (you'll get it when you see the ending of the movie)Bottom line: Abrams reboots Star Wars, trying to take credit for the good stuff others invented before him and brush under the rug the bad things that people hated. He does a reasonable enough job, but while trying to bring realism and technology to the table, he loses part of the magic that the fans were so addicted too. For Star Wars' sake, I hope the sequel will be as good as Empire Strikes back was for Star Wars, otherwise people will just be left with a childish special effect filled clone of the movie that awed their parents.",9,9,34,28 December 2015
RED," What The Expendables was supposed to be
","When I first saw the trailer for The Expendables, I was already thinking of the interesting and funny relationship between the characters played by those action icons. After a zillion trailers and a movie, I was sourly disappointed. Now, I don't know who's fault it is, but relative to The Expandables, I almost haven't heard of Red before its release. However, it was exactly what I was looking for.You have a great team of actors. They are not even action heroes, maybe that did it, but they do a great job. just look at that cast: Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Morgan Freeman, Brian Cox, Hellen Mirren, Richard Dreyfuss, even Ernest Borgnine! As the young(er) crew, Karl Urban and Mary-Louise Parker are in it and they both play well. But more than that, each character actually has a role. They don't just come in, say a few inconsequential things, then die or are completely forgotten *cough* James Remar *cough*.So it had the ridiculously packed action and at times it looked and sounded like Ocean's Eleven, who cares? The rest was great! Even the fight scenes... not even the bad guys go out in full view firing wildly then getting shot. People actually took cover, helped each other and synchronized their moves. The lines were funny and somewhat complex and all the people on the set were clearly having fun doing what they loved.Bottom line: I don't know, maybe because the director is unseasoned in the ways of Hollywood the movie turned out to be so good. Or maybe it was the cast. Or maybe it was the fun of it. The movie turned out great, with a few screw-ups that I am ready to ignore. The mash-up is Jason Bourne meets The Expendables via, luckily for us, just a pinch of Ocean's Eleven.",8,175,217,21 October 2010
Flight," A bit different from the trailer, but just
","The story was interesting and worth telling, the people in it played well - indeed, it should have been a movie I appreciated. However most of the plot was spoiled by the trailer, leaving the film just going through the motions. The rest was the story of a man addicted to alcohol. In the end, none of the conflict between heroism and drunkenness that is implied in the trailer actually happens, they are just two different and simultaneous things.Some questions are raised, perhaps, yet they are not technical, but about the personal experiences of the lead character, one that I couldn't empathize with. Had it been a film with a completely different backdrop, say a bus driver or a mountain guide or a teacher, the story would have been very much the same. So, then, I have to conclude that the plane angle was not that important to the value of the film. Then the slow pace gets you, the two hours and a quarter length.To wrap it up, I felt like the movie was intended for people who already understand addiction and that I missed some important lesson from it because I didn't go through that myself in any severe manner.Obviously it was a decent film, but not above average, I am afraid.",7,1,1,3 February 2014
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Take a trip in time and see the last great peace loving band that never existed
","The movie was not particularly smart, but it did kind of represent an era that we will never really forget: the excellent 80's. Meet the two completely spaced out losers that don't want anything else than to start a heavy metal band and will let nothing stop them, not even their lack of knowledge of their instruments. Helped by a man sent from the future, they travel back in time to gather celebrities in order to get an A+ in their oral TV show like exam. Beat that, Sly and Arnold!The film has gained a cult following immediately after, not because it was a good movie, but because it took no prisoners and it didn't take itself seriously for one second. That kind of courage from the entertainment studios was also a sign of a dying age, unfortunately.Like with the classic celebrities adolescents are forced to learn about in order to understand history, it would be criminal not to see the movie, if you ever want to know film. And for old folks like us, it is a trip back in time to happier days, when movies were fun and the world was dreaming of end to poverty and war.",7,0,0,30 August 2015
Godzilla," Godzilla times 3
","Third time is a charm, right? Wrong! In this film everything that makes Godzilla is being turned upside down and transformed into a propaganda movie for the American way of life. How can a Japanese icon created as a metaphor for the nuclear threat become the symbol of the USA supremacy? Spin away!First the monsters are ancient predators from when the Earth was radioactive, so it is not the fault of humans for their existence and any such responsibility is voided. In fact, the Bikini atoll nuclear tests were purposeful in attempting to destroy one of these monsters. Also, the creatures don't spread radioactivity, in fact they feed off it. Just put a monster egg near Fukushima and the radioactivity will magically vanish. Godzilla is actually there to preserve balance, like some kind of ancient giant Avatar: when two monsters wake up from their slumber and decide to procreate in San Francisco, Godzilla comes to the rescue and fights them both, then goes back home.Second, the entire decision process rests solely in the hands of the American military, even when they were in Japan. They simply come and take control. The news are all American and the trek of two giant monsters moving from Japan to San Francisco is just an afterthought that happens in a few minutes. The hero is a US soldier, conveniently son of a scientist obsessed with these monsters and, almost naturally, married to a medical nurse and having a small child whose only purpose is to look cute and ask for his mommy.So other than the monster fights, which are kind of boring with some exceptions, and the rather silly quest of this one guy to get to San Francisco to his family instead of telling them to get out, you get epic music, military music, motivational music, military propaganda, derision of science, arrested Americans demanding things, even some Christian prayers and lots and lots of gung-ho soldiers firing ineffective weapons at skyscraper size monsters.Oh, and in the end, after entire cities are devastated, which involves hundreds of thousands dead, a lot of respiratory related diseases in the making, Godzilla is applauded for the service it performed to restore balance.Bottom line: a complete failure from multiple standpoints: storyline, script, actor charisma, acting quality, soundtrack, logic, even action scenes. I mean can you believe that the most noticeable character for me was Elizabeth Olsen, just because she was looking nice and that was her entire role anyway? The only reason I don't rate this film lower is because of the trailers. Now those were great!",6,3,6,10 August 2014
Looper," Bruce Willis saves the world BEFORE he was Bruce Willis
","I am sorry to be so cynical about this film, because it was well done and well played, but in the end it was just two hours of touchy feely and not much of it made any consistent sense.We enter this world of killers that are paid to kill people sent from the future. You see, you can't kill someone in the future, it's too easy to track. These killers are well paid until they have to 'close the loop', kill their older selves, that is. One of these killers voluntarily goes to the past because the bad guys killed his wife. And we have gone full circle. If it's so difficult to kill people, why did they kill his wife? Then the whole film is about younger self tracking older self, which makes no sense at all, unless younger self would still do all the wrong choices older self did in order for him to exist.Bottom line: a well done movie, but a flawed one. The feel of it is gritty and shows a sort of desperation in the future, something that is great to behold. However the premise is crap and it doesn't get any better from there. Close-ups of Emily Blunt and Piper Perabo in her undies didn't save the film either, nor did the small child that was possibly the best actor of them all. In the end, the film can only be average, even if it is not the average type of movie.",7,0,2,14 October 2012
Life," Good graphics, science out of the window, decent acting, formulaic
","I don't know what Jake Gyllenhaal, Ryan Reynolds and even Hiroyuki Sanada (I love the guy, but he played in some really awful stuff) were doing in this film. The film isn't bad, but it did not require actors of their caliber other than for baiting people into theaters, and that is a big sin for a movie.I have to say that I liked the alien design and the direction. Some of the scenes were amazing. Unfortunately, the story is dumb and formulaic, going for the same cheap 'we are the good guys, so we must feel and shout and do stupid things to prove it' and an implausible form of life that defied any possible scientific rule (or space station design feature). It probably is in the interest of film makers to not make horror movies too plausible, but I hated that.Bottom line: you get to feel for the characters, mostly because of the sound performance, but the 'oh, come on!' moments ruin the mood to the point of annoyance. If you think just a little bit and you know what possible facts they are portraying in the film, the possibilities are both more interesting and more terrifying. Too bad the movie was not made for people who think a little bit.",7,1,2,3 September 2017
What We Do in the Shadows," Wanted to like it, I was bored to tears
","The premise is fun, Jemaine Clement is in it, I thought this was going to be a cool movie no matter what. It was not. They went too far with the reality TV documentary style and after one hour and a half of following silly people around who are just incidentally vampires or werewolves or whatever, I was just praying for it to just end.Some jokes were funny, but certainly not laughing out loud stuff. The acting was OK, given the plot, but really, it was a total bore. Add to this the overwhelmingly positive reviews that made me expect something so much better and it all resulted in a terrible disappointment.",6,6,15,10 March 2016
Deadpool," Fun, but less funny than I expected
","If it seems familiar, I used the same title for another Ryan Reynolds film: Waiting. It's kind of the same story: trying too hard to be witty and failing to be funny.I went to the movie with two girls, both oblivious to who the Deadpool was supposed to be or the filmographic history of both actor and character. Most of the jokes flew right over their heads! As for me, I expected those self-referential quips to be drowned in a sea of actual funny, which was somewhat lacking.Also, about its R-ratedness... not that much. It could have easily been PG-13 with some sex jokes added. For a character that was supposed to have been through hell and back, the psychological horror was severely missing and THAT is what R-rated means, not that poor prudish Americans have to hear about sex existing and seeing some random blood on the screen. Of course, that is probably because until a late phase of the movie's development, they didn't know it COULD be R-rated, so I will cut them some slack. I am excited though that it proved to studios that being a little ballsy doesn't mean people won't flock to see it. Expect all superheroes movies from now on to be a little edgy, after getting over the brooding phase.Bottom line: You know when a song is making fun of a specific genre, but objectively is part of said genre? So it Deadpool. It brings little new to the table beyond proving R can make money. Fun as it was, my favourite scene was Morena Baccarin in nude. I know, I should have started with that...",8,4,15,28 February 2016
Cloud Atlas," Bound to polarize
","Like Matrix before it, Cloud Atlas is bound to turn people into either lovers or into haters. After all, it is a movie with a great cast, fantastic special effects and a complex story; in fact so complex that at first, when the movie ends, you feel like there is a lot you have missed, that the movie should have made you understand something, but you couldn't. And, just like Matrix before it, it is just a feeling it creates, not the truth. As I see it, the truth is that the story was not complex at all, it just seemed like it, as was the moral of the story, which was not something Earth shattering, just a vision of humanity's interconnectivity.The appearance of complexity comes from all the effort that was obviously put into the film. Would it make any sense to tell a simple story in a complicated way and invest to much money into it that it becomes one of the most expensive movies of all times? Yes, it certainly makes sense, because you don't go to the cinema unless the marketing convinces you it is something great and then it is simple enough so you don't feel an idiot for not comprehending it. The skill is in making you feel like you watched something intelligent and yet you understood it easily.Bottom line: the film is a great realization compared to most other movies around now. A great cast and fantastic effects skillfully complement an intelligent story, told right. However, even if it is definitely worth watching, do not expect the film to be anything that it isn't. After all, its purpose is to make you buy the ticket, not teach you anything new and the moral of the story that our souls are inextricably connected isn't more profound than when you heard it any other place (and there are plenty of those to choose from). A pretty cool film, however, even if it leaves you with that 'is that it?' feeling when it ends.",8,1,6,2 March 2013
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Comic book James Bond
","I have to say that the film entertained me quite a lot. All actors were very good and the direction was almost flawless. If you are looking for the cellphone version of James Bond, this is the film for you. In Kingsman you find the origin story for a young adult secret service spy that then gets taken completely over the top with funky suits, weird gadgets that are used only once, the occasional dry pun and lots and lots of violence.I think Colin Firth was the right man for the job, as was Samuel L. Jackson as the villain. Probably Jackson just stopped one day and said 'I am just going to have a lot of fun for the rest of my life'. Young Taron Egerton was the main character and he performed well for his relatively short career, but let's admit it: Firth and Jackson made this movie.The problem with this comic book based film is that it feels just like a comic book. You get the archetypal Harry Potter that discovers that he is the son of special people and he is taken to the magical school for secret spies, destined to fight and defeat the evil man that should not be named, but we know is Sam Jackson. It is a children story, no matter how you take it.Bottom line: entertaining, but mindless fun. It made me wish for a deep and dark origin story for the likes of Jason Bourne: their recruitment, their training, the real alienation and mind programming, the kills and the failures and their consequences. Alas, it was just a funky JB. Best quote: 'I'll have a Martini. With gin, not vodka, obviously. Stirred for ten seconds while staring at a bottle of unopened vermouth.'",8,2,8,30 April 2015
Fast Five," Long, flashy, not much driving
","The movie lasted for a staggering two hours and ten minutes, time in which driving, the foundation of the 'Fast' franchise, was left in the backseat. The rest, weapons, flashy heist planning and ridiculous intrigue. There had to be a bad guy that was corrupt, rich and utterly evil, there had to be a henchman, just as evil, with a host of faceless drones to command, there had to be a good and honest cop that would chase them, but ultimately respect the gang for who they are, and there had to be chicks. And of course... the gang. 'The best of the best' almost copied and pasted from Ocean's 3214.That doesn't mean it wasn't a good fun action filled film, just that it was a melange of ideas that were far removed from what I liked in other Fast and Furious films. I love Dwayne Johnson and he played very well the role of the tireless cop, I like Vin Diesel, even if he seems to be on a descendant curve in his career and all the other actors did their jobs well. The thing is: was it worth waiting an hour and a half for a final race that defied logic, physics and probability and yet had little to do with driving? Not really.",6,0,1,12 March 2012
Green Book," Funny little movie about the friendship between two people in the middle of an ugly world
","The story of an Italian driving a Black man in the 60s, when both peoples were persecuted by the 'red blooded Americans', whatever that meant. It seemed a bit off some times, with the elevated black man behaving inexplicably or not knowing or understanding some concepts, but having perfect knowledge of other more complex ones. The completely unbiased Italian-American family was also a bit of a stretch. But the tale is heartwarming and fun, without getting into violence or too much ugliness and the acting is good.",8,1,2,29 January 2019
Fantastic Four," Exactly what one would expect
","I am beginning to feel nausea from all these 'Marvelous' comic book movies. How much more money do they want before they start creating something new?In Fantastic Four we see the story from the comic (and cartoons) a little modernized then filled with special effects and splashed on our screens. Cool effects, of course, but what about the story?I always felt that F4 was one of the weakest comic books. The characters were phony, the dialogues silly, the story unbelievable. While the movie does more towards the acceptance of the script and fixes the dialogues a bit, it still feels silly.Therefore I will conclude that it is a good movie for its intended audience (10 year old boys) but beyond that it's just a special FX extravaganza.",6,4,8,22 July 2005
John Wick: Chapter 2," They went with more, not better
","John Wick was nice, it was full over board action with a certain style. I have met few people that didn't like it and those who didn't mentioned their indifference to the style and the lack of reality in the plot. So for the sequel, the creators could have gone with making it all more believable, the legend more powerful because of real situations where action validated it. But no, they went with more action, more blood, more stylistic bullcrap and a complete ignorance of the laws of men, physics or biology.Don't get me wrong, it was still entertaining, but it has lost all novelty, the movie's only value remaining the individual fight scenes. And in this one the close up camera that showed Wick killing people that somehow failed to do anything at a distance destroyed that value.Bottom line: John Wick chapter 2 left me with the feeling that there are more assassins in New York than normal people and that somehow Rome is one of its little suburbs. I'll appreciate style wherever I see it, but not when function is completely abandoned for it.",7,1,5,27 May 2017
Annihilation," Weird fiction, indeed
","I read the book, first in a trilogy, before I watched the film and in that review I bet that the movie will be better than the book, which I found pretentious and opaque. Well, I can't say if I won or lost that bet. The movie is certainly different, with many ingredients added and a lot of them removed. I thought that the acting was OK and that the visuals were very good. The only issue I had was with the story, which only ponders on things, without actually explaining or expanding on any of them. That is not a bad thing, pondering, but I guess I had to be in the mood to understand the intent of the writer/director in adapting a book that I equally didn't understand. Perhaps my knowledge of programming and AI made me like Ex Machina a lot because I understood both people and non-people in it. In Annihilation I didn't get either.To paraphrase the character in the film, Alex Garland didn't intend to destroy the story with this film, he just wanted to change it. I don't know into what and I don't feel he even knew I was there. Of course, that may be all me.",7,2,5,15 March 2018
Minions," Great premise, no execution
","It took 10 minutes for the narrator to explain the premise of the movie while nothing was happening. Then animation happened, something that was supposed to be funny because the main characters were bumbling mumbling cretin yellow balls with eyes that somehow managed everything by mistake. And then it was over.Don't get me wrong, I am not against childish cartoons, I liked Despicable Me, even the second part, sort of, but this was beyond boring, utterly inane story telling, targeted for idiotic three year olds. And while I may appear to be ranting, that is an artifact of text reviews. I am very calm and objective when I am reporting that watching this is a waste of time for anyone that has lived more than 5 years.Bottom line: Sandra Bullock, John Hamm, Michael Keaton, Geoffrey Rush and Hiroyuki Sanada were actors for this nothing of a movie. The minions should have been green, with a big $ on them.",5,3,5,6 September 2015
Sin City," Visual originality on good old fashioned film noir themes
","It's hard to rate a movie that has its focus on style, rather than story, but still manages to use good plots with interesting rich characterization. Is it a perfect film or just a niche genre that cannibalizes comic books and dazzles us with nice visuals and huge stars?For me it was a bit of both. I loved the visuals and I liked the noir theme, but then I am of a certain age; I grew up with stories like that. The indomitable males that can resort to violence as easily as they breathe and only need a fantasy woman to get into action are kind of an endangered species today, when every hero must obey the politically correct guidelines of the present and all the women must be more than good looking damsels in distress, but you can see how that way of thinking was the archetype of all the hero action movies in the last 50 years. It feels strange to see a 68 year old cop kissing the 19 year old girl who is truly in love with him. Today only Michael Douglas can pull that off, and only in a film that shows how pathetically misguided he is. And how strange it is to get those morally ambiguous endings when the hero wins and also loses. Fair trade?I can only recommend watching this film. Even if it would have been worse, I would have still recommended it. The unique style, the modernized noir, the amazing cast. The only thing that I kind of disliked was that it is a mosaic film. There are actually three stories and one very short one. They kind of intersect, but only accidentally. Well, watch it.",9,4,5,23 September 2014
The Ugly Truth," Better than what I expected
","The problem with romantic movies is that they are plagued by recipes and formulas, relentlessly walking the same path until nothing remains but a dusty, barren, tasteless thing. And then they reinvent themselves, making fun of their former selves, like high school children entering a new phase and then dismissing anyone not sharing their view. But somehow, romcoms always get back to the same idea, like the tail eating snake.This one started as these 2.0 types, with the manly type showing a control freak beauty the ways of true love. And then it went the usual way. The thing is that Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler really had chemistry (even if I dislike the chick personally) and then the whole thing kind of made some sense. And I enjoyed it.And then the clich√©s started butting in where they had no business doing so. Somehow, there must be a guy with a clich√© checklist for romantic comedies and he insisted that at least half of them should be checked by any movie. Something like a romcom MPAA, maybe?Bottom line: I rated the movie high because it really was better than the crap in the genre. But it could have been so much better without some of the obvious, shoddy scenes in it. Less is better sometimes! So, the final feeling was of disappointment, as the whole thing held so much promise and yet, it ended up just another romcom.",8,1,7,4 October 2009
The Cabin in the Woods," A horror fan's wet dream
","It is hard to review this film without giving things away. This alone should tell you that the movie is good. There is no clich√© story and then a twist, so I can tell you the story and let you discover the twist. It's all twisted, so to speak.So let me tell you what this film isn't. It is not a prepackaged recipe that you know by heart but you still like to eat the end result. It is not a cinema starfest and/or an ego trip for some writer or director. The people in the leading roles are mostly TV series actors (except for Thor) while the people in the supporting roles are people we've known and loved for a while now. The film is not a bait and switch. Even if the explanation comes slowly, it does come. There are hints of what is going on all over the film even from the start. Nobody is dreaming stuff or is actually dead and doesn't know it or all that crap. What you see is what you get (even if it is not the same for the characters). There is no gratuitous humour or gore, but there is plenty of both.Bottom line: finally something original in horror movies. In a way, this is a meta movie: it explains all horror movies ever made and then laughs in the face of their predictability. 'It's time to give someone else a chance' is a quote from the film and, I think, it was meant for the movie makers. All in all, a very enjoyable film.",9,0,3,2 September 2012
Spectre," They made the Heineken commercial into a movie
","A lot of the classic Bond is in this film: the muscular unbeatable henchman, the mountain clinic, the psychotic gentleman villain striking from the shadows, a bit of car tech, the Bond girl and, most of all, Christoph Waltz as Blofeld. James Bond has to handle it all by himself again, putting the entire British intelligence apparatus in question, but hey, it's a Bond film. Or is it?When I left the film I felt severely disappointed, even if I couldn't quite say why. It didn't really feel like a James bond film. Funny enough, the Bond era that the movie was remaking is one that didn't feel much like Bond either: Lazenby's only film, On Her Majesty's Secret Service. However the similarities are drowned in the differences of the completely rewritten story.What we certainly get in the end is a Bond that refuses to kill and leaves the service for love. Back when, he lived to regret that decision, probably he will do the same in the next film from the franchise. But even without that, it still felt off: the young Q, the battle between the new M and the even newer C, the Bond car that had no gadgets and was destroyed in a few car chase scenes that were mild by the standards of driving in Rome, the limited interaction between the cardboard Bond girl and James. Somehow it all felt really off.That doesn't mean the film is not enjoyable, Daniel Craig is still fantastic in portraying 007 and the action scenes are quite fun. With all that, I felt that the spirit of the James Bond movie was somehow violated. I hope you will disagree with me when you watch the film for yourselves.",7,2,7,14 November 2015
Moon," A character piece
","I have been waiting to see this movie for over a year and now, having seen it, I have mixed feelings. The story is solid and original from a movie perspective, but not from a general sci-fi point of view. The very scenario depicted in the plot crossed my own mind thinking about the consequences of some of the technologies in the film. I can't really say too much about the subject without spoiling it, but that in itself says something about its complexity.Bottom line: a very well acted movie - considering it only has one actor and a robot with Kevin Spacey's voice, it has no choice - and a deep and moody atmosphere. The plot is ingenious, but very simple, making the whole film a character piece, well supported by Sam Rockwell. It has flaws, though, mainly that after the big twist is revealed, most of the film is fairly predictable and it felt slow. I am glad they didn't resort to over-theatrics to compensate. A good film for a quiet night, but it could have been just as well an episode in a series like Outer Limits.",8,1,3,15 November 2009
Happy Feet," Really dumbing animation movie. Profit over story.
","Basically this movie is a shameless money grabbing American extravaganza. Classic American songs, sung by nicely 3D animated penguins who do this as a religion, step dancing, etc.After a really ridiculous story that fails to grab any emotion, the story ends in a really stupid and fake way.The voices are all great actors, but their being there is solely for the purpose of getting money for this production. A lot of clich√©s, really pathetic attempt at cheap emotions.Short story, the 'hero' of the story is a penguin shunned by his peers for failing to sing, however he knows how to step dance, therefore he is immediately accepted by a few smaller penguins with Latino accents. And Robin Williams does the Latino accents. His father is an Elvis penguin while his mother is called Norma-Jean.Oh come on! Just ignore this movie! My wife just loves penguins and she gave me an unconvinced 'it was good' at the end of it. Compared to Ice-Age, for example, it simply sucks!",6,0,0,19 May 2007
Her," An original exploration of the nature of love and feeling flops
","And I don't mean flops in the teraflops kind of way, either. You see, the story is that of an (overly) sensitive man, just going through a divorce with a woman he still loves. He gets a new operating system, one that is intelligent. Luckily enough it also has the sexy throaty voice of Scarlett Johansson, incredible empathy, a sense of humor and a speed of thought that is obviously orders of magnitude above that of the average human. And they fall in love.Now, this concept alone is intriguing and its exploration worthy. However I don't feel the story did any reasonable exploring of the situation. The love is artificial not only because one of the couple is a machine, but also in its depiction. Clearly only a non technical person could have envisaged it as in the film. I wonder, what would have happened if the guy would have chosen a male voice instead of a female one? For him it was easy to fall in love with a voice, as he would imagine whatever vision of a woman he needed in order to do so. What would an AI imagine? A cool processor? (again, pun not intended)Then there is the length. You have to stand through two full hours of Joaquin Phoenix smiling sadly and making funny jokes of his misery to get to the end, which is quite frankly, not really a punchline, but a convenient and hard to believe non technical cope out. The sounds, all piano like and soft and trying to induce some sort of romantic feeling, all they did was annoy me. The AI, immediately intrusive and assertive, didn't look like any commercial product that will ever be marketed. Check out the scene where it decides what emails are funny or not and deletes the rest, after just 5 minutes of being installed. And then there is the main character.I can't accuse Phoenix for his acting, as for the character he portrayed it was perfect, but the character itself was pitiful and pathetic and I couldn't empathize with him at all. Hot actresses like Johansson (voice only), Olivia Wilde (just a small role) and Amy Adams (playing a software developer of all things, how hot is that? ) don't really change the fact that the script was focused almost exclusively on the lead actor, all other having episodic roles. So if you like the film or not depends almost exclusively on if you like the guy.Bottom line: we all know the world is going to end when we invent robot girls that want to kiss us, but if you want to explore the apparently complicated situation of a human-AI relationship, you should choose a person we can relate to and an operating system that acts like one. That would have been a lot worse for dear Theodore, I guess, but still, couldn't feel anything while watching the movie except the desire for it to end sooner.",6,2,4,26 January 2014
The Nice Guys," Noir comedy with ups and downs.
","The first scene of the film will tell you all you need to know about the feel of it all: a kid sneaks in his parents' bedroom to get a porno mag, opens to the centerfold, sees 'Misty Mountains' and while he smiles a car goes right through his house, killing its occupant, none other than Misty Mountains. You know it's going to be a comedy and you know it's going to be dark.The rest of the movie is carried by Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling. Truly, with less talented cast the film would have been a funny but failed story, and this shows most painfully towards the end of the movie, when everything goes over the top and ridiculous.That doesn't mean the film is not entertaining and, as I said, the acting was great. The script was original and some of the scenes funny as hell. It's just inconsistent, going from great ideas and scenes to ridiculous and pointless ones.You know what it reminded me of? That video camera commercial where a guy is changing the battery while a car spins out of control, hits an exploding gas station and lands in a hotel and he didn't get anything on tape. It has cars, explosions, shooting, silly characters and even a video camera film that everyone is looking for. But in the end, you just don't feel it like it was intended.",7,0,3,18 September 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Better story, fantastic special effects, completely impossible to suspend disbelief
","The reason why Mad Max was great was because it was all new. Low budget film created in an era that just started getting over movie censorship with completely unknown actors by completely unknown film makers and in a different style. It shocked the studios, it brought Mel Gibson almost accidentally in the film business and shot George Miller through the stars. The reason why it all happened in the desert was that it was an Australian film and because it was cheaper. It showed guts, originality and created true art in an otherwise classic revenge scenario.The sequels were different, better budgeted, more post- apocalyptic, more action packed, with more action and, frankly, that is what most people remember about Mad Max, unfortunately.Mad Max Fury Road is better acted, better written and better directed by the same George Miller. The huge budget allowed for all types of wacky things. But it was nothing but a rehashing of the two sequels. It was not a reboot of Mad Max, but a reboot of the mad tribe car chase wacky races.All the well designed characters, all the wonderful scenes filled with tension and nitro, all the epic scenes of people worshiping the guy who gives them water by pouring it on the dry rocks, they all fail when one imagines Dastardly and Muttley in one of those cars chasing 'the war rig'. The various weird vehicles and attack methods were just rehashes of scenes from Mad Max 2 and 3, even the bad guy was a rehash, from the original at least. This might have worked back then in '81 and '85, but it doesn't work now. It all looked so over the top that it was impossible to feel any real thing. It was just like watching cartoons.Bottom line: the movie entertained me and it was better than average, but I have to penalize it for wasting obvious talent in writing and acting on pointless scenes of ludicrous road carnage and on rehashing the silly part of the Mad Max universe. It gave people what they wanted, but not what they needed and turned Mad Max into yet another comic book character.",8,3,10,26 June 2015
Warcraft," Done really well, considering
","There were several constraints that the movie had to work with. There was the already established Warcraft mythos and stories, there was the terrible stigma of game adaptations and finally there was the matter of so many main CGI characters that had to look realistic, not like something Pixar or Disney designed. Given that, I was not expecting much.Yet the movie exceeded all my expectations and gave me hope for the future. The story is something placed at the end of chapter III of the mythos and the beginning of chapter IV. In game, it is the story of Warcraft I, which was another bold move, considering the hordes (heh heh heh) of World of Warcraft players that weren't even born when that game was published. It pits the peaceful kingdom of Azeroth vs the war clans of the unknown Orc, fleeing from their dying world through a portal fueled by the very thing that destroyed it. A half human, half orc girl is instrumental in providing information about who the Orcs are, what they want and how they have reached the kingdom.Characters were well developed, graphics were good, the script had few holes and the mature story was clearly well smoothed out. The only problem one could have is that it's just the first part in many, with the main conflict point resolved, but none for the character story lines.Actors came from all kinds of TV series, Vikings, Preacher and Legends of Tomorrow to name a few. The only predominantly big screen actor out there was Ben Foster. It shows both the direction of cinema and TV blending together (and perhaps with games) and the fear of well established cinema actors getting caught in unsuccessful game adaptations. Perhaps with the success of this and - one may only hope - Assassin's Creed, things will begin to change.",8,2,4,8 July 2016
The Runaways," Well done, but a bit boring
","When I heard that the movie was telling the story of one of the bands in which Joan Jett played, I wanted to see it. Expecting a deluge of estrogenic hormonal music and pure rock and roll, I was a bit taken aback by the artsy, silent, character oriented take of the film, but in the end I liked it.The movie is about The Runaways, an all girl rock band which reached cult status in 1975, but the real story is more of the young and lost teens that were part of it. All the actresses play well, Dakota Fanning again showing a lot of skill, and one of the executive producers in the movie is Joan Jett herself, so the story must be close to the truth.Unfortunately there is too little focus on the actual music and the pained silences of the characters turn this more into a drama than a band movie. The start is boring, the pace gets a little better towards the end, but I guess you have to be in the mood to like it.",7,4,9,24 October 2010
Me Before You," Romantic drama. Nothing less, nothing more.
","The film was not bad, but nor was it anything new. It was by the numbers, with a script that could just as well have been written in the 60s (and at times it felt so)The biggest stars of the film are, of course, Emilia Clarke's eyebrows. I dare anyone to give me any other reason why they chose to see the movie. Either it was Khaleesi or maybe Dr. Who's companion that drew you to watch it. It certainly weren't the 5 seconds of screen time that Charles Dance had and it wasn't the age old story of the poor girl that falls in love with the quadriplegic prince.While the film ends on a bitter sweet note, I didn't find it terribly entertaining, while the characters had an infantile morality that made me unable to relate to any of them. Absolutely average in every respect, except of course Clarke's eyebrows.",7,1,4,7 August 2016
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Great CGI, grade school story
","Didn't expect anything else and I got exactly that. Like the consistent experience of a hotel in a chain, you watch this getting exactly what you paid for. I often wonder if someone dumbs down the scripts in order to preserve the feel of the franchise, because I can't imagine people getting paid for such ridiculous stories.Other than that, the special effects were a lot of work for the CGI team, although they didn't feel as flashy as those from Transformers 2. You have a full invasion of a major American city using armies of Decepticon ships. I liked the idea of the Americans going to the Moon because there was something there they needed and the Russians not going because the Americans got there first. If only it was used in a better movie.The girl is not Megan Fox anymore and, if I thought she was kind of bland in the previous movie, you should see the new girl. Blonde with British accent, though. It is all the rave. As another reviewer said: no heart and soul in this movie, not even as much as in the previous two.",Null,1,4,6 November 2011
The Social Network," An average celebrity movie
","They did it all before, the movie about some famous person that lives his life in a somewhat higher state of existence than anybody else, yet has human problems and deals with them while the story of their great idea is being told. I've seen stuff like that made about Einstein and the only different thing is that it is based in a college environment and the celebrity is still alive and that everything has to be put on fast forward because it is happening with young cool people. They even have Justin Timberlake in it... eeaayy!Now, is it a bad film? Not at all. It does what it is supposed to do. It brings the drama and the story together while conveying the feeling that anyone can do it, if they are focused enough. And that's the main push of the story: genius is different and you must allow for some issues and forget uncommon behaviour. Einstein was Jewish too and kind of an asshole, as well, but he was brilliant. You might think that I am making a leap comparing these two guys, but it is not me, it is the makers of the film that made the two media personnas as similar as to draw connection.Mark Zuckenberg was a pretty pathetic human being, but that was the kind of thing that made him able to push away every distraction and devote his life to a purpose. Put this way, anything is easy to do, certainly easier than when you are also trying to have a life. He was also inspired by others and it shows in the film, which is the best part of the movie, if you ask me.Bottom line: average film, obviously altered story for dramatic purpose, everything looking really fast because it just had to feel dynamic, but good production quality and good acting. A masterpiece it is not and I can see this film split into little scenes that then are montaged together in a Discovery Channel celebrity show. It does give food for thought, as it shows you have to start early and get there first, but also that for the same reasons, the vast majority of people could never do that.",7,1,2,12 February 2011
The Proposal," Started great, ended in a disgusting clich√©
","At first I thought it could be possible that the movie was really as good as the hype and the marketing made it out to be. I mean, it is a romantic comedy, so could it really show chemistry between the two protagonists, really be funny and not stick to the stupid, idiotic formulas that rule this genre?The start showed all that promise and then it started to go awry. Suddenly the self-empowered New York book editor remembers her passion for hip-hop music, starts dancing ridiculously, accepts anything is thrown at her by the incredibly rude Alaskan family that couldn't have been more annoying to either boy or girl. And in the end, this leads to love. Really?!So, from something relatively good it became average by completely trashing the ending. It is still reasonably good for the genre, but hell... how hard is it to make a real script for once?",7,1,5,27 September 2009
Alien: Covenant," Prometheus 2 is no Alien
","The film looks great and the soundtrack is very good. Michael Fassbender does a good double role as the two androids, as he usually does with whatever material is given to him. That's it. There isn't anything else redeeming about the movie.This is truly a sequel to Prometheus. It directly follows that story, shows characters that are doing the same mistakes as the crew of the Prometheus and in trying to push (again) the strong female lead they really mess up by making everybody else clinically retarded. What is worse is that the lead is not even close to Ripley and manages to be worse than Shaw. The rest of the cast are just idiots, conveniently chosen to check the inclusive check boxes: Black guy who does nothing really other than die, check; Women everywhere, even if they behave hysterically and can't do anything right, check; Gay couple that survives a little bit more than the black guy, check. Of course, no Asian guy, because that's allowed. Even the AI was stupid in this film.Bottom line: I can't talk too much about the plot without spoiling it (it's that paper thin), but I can tell you that my wife, who doesn't watch horror movies and couldn't care less about Alien or the mythos or realism in film, was outraged at how bad it all was. I simply expected it to be better than Prometheus. It wasn't.",6,0,4,2 August 2017
The Martian," The sci-fi we deserve and need to see
","I've read the book before I watched the movie and I absolutely loved it. It's sense of humorous optimism and of the value of scientific achievement is, quite frankly, unparalleled. So the question is, how did the movie fare? It did really well, too!This is the kind of science fiction movie that we need to see: it is about science, using fiction. It is not using technobabble to give us fiction. The difference is huge! Also, most 'sciency' films are going for the dark and broody feel, discussing the things that people fear about science, not the things that people love. The Martian does not do that!Not everything is rosy, though. In order to cram a book filled with inner introspection, science calculations, explanations of what was going on, all going on for almost two years, the film had to take some liberties with what was shown and what wasn't. My feeling is that they did a good job, but even for a two hour and a half movie it wasn't quite enough. My wife was still asking me what was going on and why did he do that and where is he going.In fact, the biggest defect of the movie was to eliminate the sense of size for the planet Mars that is present in the book. Seeing some guy going to the Pathfinder landing spot in a few minutes and then Pathfinder back at base doesn't begin to show the scale of travel and difficulty Watney had to overcome. Also, Damon does a good job bringing humor to the script, but the book was filled with jokes and that Weir humor and optimism.Bottom line: A movie that doesn't need deux ex machina to save the protagonist, doesn't need implausible crises or alien villains to share the thrill and terror of space exploration and yet shows that hope, friendship, skill and hard work, knowledge and science can overcome any obstacle. We needed that. Thank you, Andy Weir! Thank you, Ridley Scott!",9,9,54,4 October 2015
The Fighter," Great biographical drama about box fighters
","I really like Mark Wahlberg as an actor and, even if I suspect he did this film in order to fondle Amy Adams, he did a great movie here. The fighting scenes were not always perfect, but then again, it is not about the fights, it's about the fighters.The Fighter perfectly depicts the trap in which some people find themselves, quicksand they can't get out of, holding them down with the unwitting help of family and friends. This is a happy story though, not only in script, but also in real life, since this is not only a sports film, but also a biographical film, based on true events. At two hours in length, it has about 5 minutes of actual fighting, the rest being about the characters.Mark Wahlberg did a great role, but he was probably overshadowed by Christian Bale, who had the much more difficult role of the older brother. Amy Adams was wonderful, as always; she did have a rather difficult role as well. Kudos to Melissa Leo, an actress I don't know, but who has a lot of acting experience and played the strongest female role in the film and did it well.Bottom line: on par with Warrior, which was also a 2011 film about fighters coming from broken and low income environments, but with a different feel. Over all, a very impressive and enjoyable film.",9,0,1,15 October 2012
Evil Dead II," Middle part of the trilogy, lose some horror, add some humour
","The movie starts with a stripped down version of the first Evil Dead. The first movie ended with a thing coming very fast at Bruce Campbell and he screaming. After 5 minutes or so of getting to that part, the evil force or whatever it is carries him a few meters and transforms him into a monster. But then the sun arrives to turn him back.What follows next is basically the first movie, but with a lot more humour and a completely different ending. This movie was actually the last I've seen from the Evil Dead trilogy and it makes the smooth transition from the pure horror flick that was the first movie to the funny third part.I think watching all three movies one after the other gives one insight not only into the makings and evolution of Evil Dead, but also of the entire horror/fantasy/monster genre from 1981 to 1993.",7,0,2,16 April 2006
Up in the Air," The perfect crisis movie
","Leave it to George Clooney to play the guy who's job is to fire people in the midst of this great economic crisis and make you feel sorry about him. The movie is mature, not a stereotypical clich√©, with well thought up situations and believable characters. No one is totally white or totally black, which is the first step in making a good movie in my book. Or a good book, that is :)In this film he is a hypersailor. I know, I made that up, but it's the perfect metaphor as he flies from place to place doing his job and ending up spending more time in the air than in any other place. He doesn't even own a home or even rent and his greatest pleasure is to make a presentation of how the things you own and the people you know are nothing but dead weights.Now, this could have been a total screwup, by placing some wide eyed female star to steal his heart and make him realize his mistake of not being a star-crossed lover, not wanting kids or to settle. But it wasn't at all like that. In the end you are left to draw your own conclusions and the whole experience was constantly pleasant. Good movie. I recommend it.",9,1,5,16 January 2010
Atonement," Well done drama
","Well, I was torn between grading it an 8 or a 9. My wife tipped the vote. You see, the movies that make her cry are good movies to her. The film is a snapshot of pre-war England and a few scenes during the war itself. The perspective of the characters changes so that we can see the different ways the story could have been told.Now, what can I say? The level of detail makes this movie good. The acting is very nice. The soundtrack is good (and I especially liked the typewriter effect in the music that tells us without a shadow of a doubt that we are watching a movie based on a book, therefore it has a point).All these qualities are included in my grade, but my personal opinion is not. You see, I am kind of tired of the emotional tension between people that have strong feelings towards each other, but that they cannot consume. Women find this romantic, I find it plain annoying. Well, of course, you would say, men are all about the consummation, but that's not the point. Does one feel better of their own lives when watching the pitiful mishaps of others? It doesn't work on me. Do I need to experience sadness from time to time in order to feel alive? Certainly not.Therefore my conclusion is that this is a great film to see with your beloved, yet not one that actually has a point - except from a historical perspective. You don't get to learn any useful skills out of the movie, nor do you get to see some great new story that no one has seen before. It's just a plain old boring drama that is excellent crafted.",9,0,1,10 February 2008
V for Vendetta," Great movie, a must see, too bad it was a Wackowski ending
","I started watching this movie thinking it's another Ultraviolet/Aeon Flux/Catwoman clone. The only thing that made me watch it was Hugo Weaving in the cast. I was blown away.Let's start from the beginning. This is a movie about political extremism, about fear and the lack of it, about how easy people can be forced into submission and, of course, how they should force themselves out of. You can easily compare the movie with Matrix, this one being not a protest against everyday life, but one against live as it becomes slowly but surely.OK, there's this guy, a true terrorist, killing people and blowing things up for a cause. Fortunately for this movie, it is a literate one and very well interpreted by Hugo Weaving. His purpose is to overthrow the oppressive government that rules the UK much like Hitler ruled Germany. It is ironic that the dictator is interpreted by John Hurt, this being the mother of all political full circles. He is helped by the first reluctant Natalie Portman. Stephen Rea has the role of the good cop trying to uncover the story beneath it all, much like in Citizen X.Overall there are good ideas in the movie, a true plot, as opposed to the dreadful idiocies that I mentioned at the beginning, good acting and, of course, a happy ending. Who can really defeat Smith?The only bad thing about this movie is the theatrics. I'm OK with the visuals, since the movie is based on a graphic novel (that's what they call comics in the UK, apparently), but I really despise knife jugglery before throwing the damn thing and over talking. It is hard to connect with the main character, since he is acting like a classic villain: Black mantle, mask, talking all the time with a British/Aussie accent. Anyway, like in Matrix, the ending is grandiose, with fireworks and the whole Brisith parliament building exploding from a single subway wagon full of explosives. But then again, the word parliament comes from French and it means the place of talks. And I really didn't like the talking too much. Hmmm :)",8,0,2,10 June 2006
The Island," Well made Free Jack remake
","Sue me, I liked this movie, especially since I've read the IMDb page AFTER seeing it. I think that the plot outline reveals too much of the plot and makes the first quarter of the film less enjoyable.Maybe you remember the movie Free Jack, where Emilio Estevez was running from Antohny Hopkins and his henchman Mick Jagger. This movie is a lot like that. You add 21 century special effects and a runaway chick (rather than a semi corrupt ex girlfriend that helps the hero, like in Free Jack) and you've got yourself a block buster.But I do think that Ewan McGregor made a very nice role. Scarlets role was less demanding and I do feel bad about the way she tries to look like a diva in her latest movies, even if she was gorgeously beautiful when she wasn't trying, in Lost in Translation, but she performed admirably as well.The plot is nice, it mixes the Free Jack story with a bit of Matrix. It is a bit far fetched for my style, especially the way the main characters evade (and almost completely wipe out :) ) a special force team.It's worth watching and for this type of movies I give it a top grade.",8,0,2,16 August 2005
Furious 7," Pure testosterone, no story
","Of course you don't expect much from the story of a film like this, so I will tell you about everything else: cars, planes, cars, tall buildings, cars, attack helicopters, cars, drones, cars, demolishing buildings... did I mention cars?In truth, the cars scenes were not so relevant. It all felt like they struggled to find reasons to use cars in an otherwise completely unrelated scenario. Jason Statham comes off as a real badass, The Rock is as usually huge and intimidating, but in this film Vin Diesel just outmanned everybody. He is a beast!So if you want spectacular scenes that have no regard to logic, this is the film for you. Unfortunately, I would have preferred the last film in the series to have been more meaningful. Instead they just babbled on about family and destroyed cars. The property damage inflicted to kill two assassins and save a hacker was probably in the tens of millions, if not more.",7,3,17,12 May 2015
