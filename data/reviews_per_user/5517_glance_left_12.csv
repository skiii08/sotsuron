Black Swan," Ugly Duckling
","It didn't take long for Black Swan to reveal itself as yet another irretrievable step down the path of over-wrought cinematic pathos for Aronofsky...which is unfortunate for me being a cautious fan of his until recently. To be fair, there are those who enjoy this kind of thing....say, for instance, ballet and opera aficianados who, with respect to stifling pathos, seem to enjoy gorging on the stuff (it never ceases to amaze me how both opera and ballet manages the unlikely juxtaposition of highly evolved, raw physical talent with that of the ridiculous, often down-right silly, story line).Pathos, perhaps for many, is akin to something along the lines of Beluga caviar...considered a refined delicacy for those who saunter in such circles...yet, for the likes of this simple-minded average Joe, can be nothing more than fish eggs...which may occupy the category of 'gustatory novelty' within the first couple of mouthfuls, but which inevitably becomes salty, unpalatable mush shortly thereafter. Ergo the flight path of Black Swan, when the feathers started to fly. It was certainly interesting, initially, in its cinematic style, unusual risky/fringe-y setting and characters, with fascinating emotional contextual tension. But the novelty soon became buried in the gluttony of melodrama which only was elevated to absurdity when given a hallucinogenic inflection.My wife and I were gracious at 'the party', though...recognizing the rapt facial expressions on those sitting around us. We managed to somehow subdue overt laughter. And when offered another silver spoonful of that black, gelatinous roe by the white-gloved catering crew, I simply and respectfully said, 'No thank you'. Leaving our seats..and the stifling je ne sais quoi of it all...was a profound relief!",5,5,14,5 January 2011
Hostel," buckets of blood added to snoring action plot line
","Well, the director really stands out on a limb in this one...a limb on the end of a bloody stump, that is! Contemporary horror artist's seem to by trying desperately to recapture the singular sensation engendered by Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which, when compared to Tobe Hooper's other films, seems to be a masterful fluke if you ask me. Something which is stumbled upon, like a diamond sitting in the dirt, and cannot be achieved again.We've had 'Tension', 'Wolf Creek' and now 'Hostel'. And inspecting the whole process here, it's hard to figure out why these films fail by comparison...but they do. Sure, I winced during some of the more grisly scenes, but the primal horror I felt during TCM was nowhere in sight. The sadism in TCM was far more brutal and alien. The victims were reduced to absolute and sheer panic without a shred of composure left to them...which is what blind, insatiable sadism wants....blind and insatiable fear. The victims in the most recent horror films still maintained an element of heroism (the final twist in Tension was kind of a cop-out if you ask me...like the writer was retracing his steps to cover up a stalling plot line). All this says to me is that the writer and director seem unwilling to cross the line into true horror and opted to save a shred of hope for their audience...which may be satisfying on one level...and yet, we all still compare them to the shrieking nightmare of TCM, shake our heads and wonder what happened to the good olÃ© days.",6,2,3,21 April 2006
Crash," somebody give me some air!
","Good grief!! You wanna know what I think? I think that Paul Haggis, Paul Thomas Anderson (Magnolia), and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (21 Grams) should all get together and direct a movie so bloated with irony, portent, ominous interplay and emotional critical mass that, on opening night, the theater, the screen, the reels, the audience...hell, the surrounding city block, would actually implode on itself creating a massive celestial event like a black hole.The scene that did me in was the scene of Matt Dillon's character sobbing and leaning over his father suffering on the potty with a Karen Carpenter-style track crooning mournfully in the background. This one actually brought tears to my eyes....for all the WRONG reasons! Gotta get off the computer before my wife finds what I wrote, though....she LOVED it!",4,2,9,11 September 2005
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," turgid virtuosity
","My goodness! This movie fairly gushes virtuosity. A feast for the eyes as they pan across the scuttling filigree of London antiquated. Every scene is rendered exquisitely so Even in the dark light of the Gothic grotesque, it is quite beautiful. I found myself swept up in this poetry effortlessly...the classic theme of revenge woven through the miasma of all things London bleak. The peeling walls and crumbling plaster a visceral chiaroscuro against the artful gleam of Todd's straight razor. All this is a guilty pleasure, I admit One I indulged with abandon, I tell you...like a swoon in an opium den...until...until...Until the singing started. Please, dear lord...make it stop!",6,0,2,2 May 2008
Shutter Island," Has 'The Pledge' and 'The Turn'...but where's 'The Prestige'?
","Michael Cain's character, Cutter, in Christopher Nolan's 'The Prestige' says of magic...'Every great magic trick consists of three parts or acts. The first part is called 'The Pledge'. The magician shows you something ordinary: a deck of cards, a bird or a man. He shows you this object. Perhaps he asks you to inspect it to see if it is indeed real, unaltered, normal. But of course... it probably isn't. The second act is called 'The Turn'. The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it, because of course you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be fooled. But you wouldn't clap yet. Because making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call 'The Prestige'.' When one goes to see a great magic show....a premier show....a VEGAS show....it's the preceding reputation of the magician that draws the crowd. Scorsese is such a magician, in my personal esteem. Hell, let's say that, in this particular show, its a collaborative effort of TWO magicians....Scorsese and DiCaprio...which draws us in. I, like many of you, paid the price of admission because I've been thrilled before....been transfixed and then transported into that rarefied air...the sorcerer's aether that leaves one floating in a kind of post-hypnotic bliss long after the movie is over. So, once again, I sit down waiting to be intoxicated again. The lights dim...cell phones turn off...and the curtains lift...The 'pledge', as Cutter calls it, is the stage set for Scorsese's magic...a US marshal sent to investigate the disappearance of an inmate/inpatient of a whole island set aside for the treatment/detention of the criminally insane. Welcome to Shutter Island. And the set is a gorgeous one. Everything about it drips with the requisite Gothic, cloistered mystique required for this kind of story. Scorsese delivers here....in spades.The 'turn' is pulled off in a progressive, galloping crescendo of psychological tension as DiCaprio's character becomes embroiled in the ambient madness the cannot help but flourish in such a place. His outer circumstances are exquisitely reflected in his inner turmoil...those crystalline, fever-liveried dreams which are nothing short of pure Scorsese virtuosity. Without delving into the plot details, which has been done many times in previous reviews, magic happens throughout this transformational segment of the film. I'm well along for the ride, every step of the way...gut roiling...heart beating...feeling that delicious vertigo 'as if I'm there'.This above is enough, I feel, to warrant going to see the film. It's a visual/emotional spectacle that will impact your state of awareness, without question. The real question is, however, 'is this a masterpiece?' No...it isn't. It simply cannot be, perhaps by virtue of a certain code (if there is such a thing) amongst magicians (great film directors). The reason is clear, as in Cutter's final words of the above quote, 'Because making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call 'The Prestige'.' 'The Prestige' of Shutter Island is in the final twist....bringing the magically transformed, careening plot back somehow to tie those wildly flailing loose ends up in a bow. It does this in a single scene...but, in doing so, makes one of the most egregious mistakes a magician can make in comporting the final elements of his big act: it steals the Prestige from another magician...from several, in fact....and this is inexcusable. Perhaps its unfair...but it is reality. Magic can be many, many things...but it can never be redundant. It must always be fresh...must always be arising and precipitating from the edge of impossibility and artful creativity. The simple fact is, the final twist of Shutter Island has been done before. And once I acknowledged this fact, sitting there in the theater, I came thumping back down to earth...looked apologetically at my wife and asked her what she thought of the film. Her response says it all....'It was o.k.'",7,0,2,6 March 2010
Salt," Turgid Spy Schtick
","They almost made it. So close! One more impeccably choreographed, operatic action sequence....one more whip-lash plot twist...one more peel-off of the latex facial disguise...one of any of these and Salt tips the scales to become a full blown parody, whether it wants to or not. And, my god, did you SEE that disguise? Straight out of the SNL skit footlocker. Simply awful...and hilarious.Alas, Salt didn't quite tip the scales, though...which left me in the somewhat unsatisfying position between being unable to take the film seriously and, then again, unable to give it a full-bodied Mystery Science Theater 3000 scoffing. And so....The Urban Dictionary has an interjection which accurately describes the feeling upon following through to the credits on this film. One syllable...three letters...often served with slightest of shoulder shrugs....'meh'",5,1,4,7 January 2011
Drive," It's Alive! Sort of.....
","A cadaveric stitching together of elements which worked, once upon a time, with David Lynch's 'Wild at Heart' and 'Blue Velvet'...and then Luc Besson's 'Leon: The Professional' with perhaps some of Scott's 'True Romance' sewn in to boot. It's all in there..the atmospheric, haunting yet innocent musical score (sooo Lynchian!) The uber-violent yet yearning-to-be-innocent lead, a blend of Lynch's Sailor, Scott's Clarence and Besson's Leon, while Irene plays the iconic purely innocent compensatory female support which was manifest, in some form or fashion, in each of these films. The result? Something which, like Shelley's tragic/ironic monster, wants to live and love in a meaningful way, but instead simply lurches about mindlessly without pulling either off very well at all. Toward the end, had to fight the strong impulse to simply put the poor idiot out of its misery...i.e turn off the t.v. before the credits rolled.",4,0,2,10 February 2012
Unknown," We get the gist...of the twist
","There's lots to love about this film....brisk tempo, exotic intrigue, fleet-footed action sequences...the best of which were displayed in many of my favorite films of this genre: the Bourne trilogy, The Fugitive, etc.The Unknown is propelled forward quite effortlessly by these elements...until, surprisingly, then end. Has anyone experienced that moment in a commercial flight when the smooth, intense acceleration of lift-off and ascent subtly disengages to settle in for level flight? That's usually the point when people (those not jaded by excessive air travel, that is!) break out their books, iPads, Air Malls...the moment when the thrill is gone. I felt something of that shift watching Unknown draw to a close. The coveted 'unpredictable plot twist' just didn't deliver me through that sling-shot feeling which so gripped me in movies that expertly employed the device in the past (I'll never forget my gaping jaw in The Sixth Sense...totally, blissfully blind-sided). I remember looking at my wife, after the big revelation (no, I won't spoil) with a look that said...'I'm not feeling it' Could we be at that unhappy moment, ladies and gentlemen? The tipping point when unpredictable plot twists have gone through their permutations...to the point that they have simply become predictable? A very sad day, indeed, if that is the case.Perhaps the new unpredictable plot twist will be....no plot twist at all.",7,5,9,8 March 2011
Million Dollar Baby," long, languid.....and dull
","Mystic River pulled it off. It had perfect pacing and tension woven into an artfully fluid drama/tragedy. The audience was allowed a sneak into the machinery of Boston Americana and then allowed to go a little deeper into it's underbelly. It was strange and horrible and beautiful too. Million Dollar Baby, conversely, began to feel wincingly contrived as it began to resolve. Have you guys ever read poetry that was TRYING to be poetry...it's painful to read, almost...for all the wrong reasons. Well this movie was a tragedy that was TRYING to be a tragedy. I was never transported in this film. I felt stranded in my seat watching a film about boxing with some flakey comic relief and lots of piteous twists of fate. Each new heaping of plot, toward the end, elicited groans and massaging of my temples...not in empathy, but in dismay. I was barely finished processing one mouthful in one moment when another spoonful comes marching in. It's one thing to be stung by irony in a story and quite another to be buried up to your neck in it.I know, I know...these kinds of things do happen, and they are awful....we've got our Christopher Reeve story...I cannot imagine the struggle that these heroes undergo. But I'm gonna have to insist on some sense of evolution within film making these days. Of course we need tragedy in our movies...I love to hate tragedy...but give it an edge...God knows, being murdered with a dull blade is, well...murder. I cannot help but to think that the Academy is starting to crust over with its lack of movement...like old pudding. Somebody needs to stir the pot...Aviator was a far better film.",Null,1,4,8 August 2005
Zombieland," The Zombies can keep up the enthusiasm...why can't we?
","First of all, I really liked this film. Well-paced and, in the end, folds with a healthy stack of chips on the felt. Just in time before the tables turn, I thought. 'Nice job!' Still though, the movie illustrates a gripe I've had with the motif of the resulting production of what seems to be evidence of gestating talent at the helm. I'm talking SUSTAIN, people. There is the pure magic at the beginning of the film....the seduction, if you will. Those of us in the movie going world begging to be seduced WANT to be intoxicated and then sinfully transported into the same rapture promised in the throes of the seduction. To be blunt...we want a crescendo and then a earth rupturing climax, dammit! And why not? Millions of dollars were involved in the production, were they not? Where's the goddamn sustainable energy....enthusiasm.....unadulterated LUST that causes us to wiggle in our seats at the beginning...turn to our date and say, 'OMG...this is gonna be GOOD!'? A movie rarely lives up to the initial thrust. Why is that? I don't get it. The inspirational juice is flowing at the beginning...why can't it flow right up to the end? It's just not fair.Same thing happens with Zombieland. The cinematic displayed action literally disinters us from reality so thoroughly, like the initial rush of an IV drug, I felt suspended right along with the time elapsed motion of the zombies and their exquisitely rendered panic-enslaved prey. It was perfect. Within a few moments, I felt the swoon and said, 'Take me!'....that wonderful feeling while watching a film we're all familiar with. And then...the story unfolded...the character development amidst the motion of the plot. Don't get me wrong. There was novelty...enough to keep me alert and appreciative. But, it wasn't quite what was advertised, I'm afraid.It's so rare that a movie sustains a level of energetic edgy-ness. The kind of alpha-to-omega romp that has you walking to your car dazed with rumpled shirt tails hanging out and your hair messed up....with your cell phone in hand and the insurmountable desire to 'kiss and tell'.",8,0,0,9 February 2010
Wedding Crashers," a tear streaming, snot bubble riot!
","Don't get me wrong....I love a movie with depth, intrigue, portent, ramifying layers of sophistication, complexity, and philosophical tete-a-tete.But I went into Wedding Crashers and shamelessly laughed...out loud...for the duration of the film. I'm talking to the point where I could barely catch my breath. My recommendation is to avoid this film if one is sleep deprived or over-dosed on caffeine (both of which make one more prone to hilarity) to avoid the risk of cardiac arrest or, at the very least, a sports hernia.Check it out...it was a blast!",8,1,2,5 December 2005
The Fighter," Empty Haymaker
","Fights themselves (boxing, mma, whatever) are hit and miss, to shamelessly indulge in the pun...a gamble, whether you're paying for ringside seats or tossing out a few bills for the pay-per-view. Some almost seem to be magically choreographed, resulting in spectacular action.....brutal, violent poetry-in-motion that is talked about for years afterwards. Others are spectacular duds, regardless of the supposed talent dancing in the ring...listless and impotent...forgotten or laughed at, depending on the level of failure (hungry Mikey? :) Movies are like that, we all know...boxing movies especially. Let's compare a couple big ones of late. Take Cinderella Man with Russel Crowe in '05 and then last year's The Fighter with Christian Bale and Mark Wahlberg. Big talent in both, yes? Heavy-weights to be sure. Both these movies had all the pre-release ingredients of a title fight...yet only one of them was actually worth the price of admission, from my own minuscule perspective (both are equally and pervasively well-liked by IMDb's viewers, amazingly enough....both commanding 8.0/10 with over 60,000 votes apiece).Cinderella Man seemed to moved with liquid grace throughout the film. Everything one might cherish about a Dicken's novel was clearly conveyed...with heartfelt characters struggling to survive in impossible circumstances...characters who make that rare transformation from 'everyman' to 'hero' in some ever-accelerating juxtaposition of destiny that offers its feeling of crescendo...of portent...to every step, every blow in the ring (the fight scenes themselves were exquisitely orchestrated, BTW) and every dramatic circumstance beyond the ring. Simply put, its a beautiful story...even in the context of the motif of two men beating the hell out of each other in front of crowds of people. I, too, was 'ringside' and I felt truly involved...emotionally invested...in the fate of the characters in the story. And when everything was on the line toward the end, I felt the feeling of risk as well...nerves taught and pupils dilated...on edge...transported. Being magically transported...I've said, it before...that is the mark of a good movie. Cinderella Man transported me, effortlessly right through to the credits.Now take The Fighter. All the grace evident in CM is nowhere to be found in this film. And I mean nowhere. Our boxing hero 'Irish' Micky Ward is honorable only in comparison to his degenerate family, his mother and sisters (my god, how many?) a brood of greasy harpies who could only stoop lower by resorting to actual cannibalism. To see behavior like this outside the remote hills of Appalachia is downright scary, IMHO. His half-brother, Dicky, is equally degenerate without harboring the same predatorial spark his sisters engender. He's simply an addict using his crack induced euphoria to fuel delusions of grandeur about the good ole days of his long gone fighting career. Ultimately there's no sense of a hero's heart in Micky though, even in spite of his family. He chooses to indulge them throughout...even at the behest of his new-found 'Ariadne' (Amy Adams' playing Micky's girlfriend, Charlene) sent in to attempt to lead our hero out of the dark maze of his ill-fated life. Not much help here, unfortunately...she simply doesn't have the drive or the intelligence to provide escape velocity for our dopey, earth-bound fighter. Simply put, this movie lacks heart. There's plenty of muscle and movement, but the overriding stupidity and squalor leaves a bad taste in one's mouth. The only saving grace, from a technical perspective, was the impressive, jaw-dropping transformation that Bale pulled off to become Dicky...as impressive as his unbelievable transformation in The Machinist and Charlize Theron's in Monster. He was every ounce the manic addict, sweaty and unflinchingly irresponsible at every opportunity. Nice job Bale. But that's about it for Fighter. No help from the fight scenes, themselves, either. They were poorly executed and unconvincing, offering no respite from my growing disappointment and smoldering repulsion.This one is punch drunk, folks: only peripherally funny but moreover primally offensive to watch.",Null,1,1,27 July 2011
