Skyfall," Tedious....
","Had anyone putting this script together actually read an Ian Fleming 007 story? Where is the characterisation? To start with, James Bond would never wear lace up shoes but let's not get tied up with that. Despite his 'womanizing' he would certainly not make some glib joke about a drink, if his lover had just had her head blown off in front of him. This was a sick and totally un-Bondlike piece of misogynistic script writing that undermines the true literary character of 007, who would not have cared to much about the bad guy's intent to dominate the world, or kill 'M'in this case (what a weak plot)but rather his whole being would be set on avenging the girl - read the books! This could have been any 'thriller', with any 'hero' beating the bad guys - it is not a James Bond story. The good things about it? Well thank goodness JD has turned up her toes as 'M'(we all love you JD...but not as 'M'); but Ralph Fiennes as the new 'M'? Inspired!!! RF, I suspect, has read the Bond books as his portrayal came over in the movie as a 'Fleming' character. He's an excellent choice. Daniel Craig? No, sorry. Sauve, debonair, public schoolboy, Royal Naval officer...? Move on please Dan. You're a great actor...at other things. Oh, and product placement? I was worried that we were looking at the Omega watch for so long that the battery would run out! You guys in production just have to do better.",1,21,43,8 November 2012
Saving Mr. Banks," Brilliant
","This is a thoroughly engaging film with stellar performances from its cast, especially Emma Thompson who is just wonderful. She must surely be at least 'nominated' for a host of awards for this role. Discovering the 'origins' of Mary Poppins wasn't exactly on my movie hit list but on a wet winter's afternoon in northern England and a wife who wanted to see the film, what was I to do? I was, in the end, so pleased that circumstance (and my wife)had taken me to the cinema. The humour is side splitting, the drama tragic - take some tissues with you because one way or the other, you will cry.
