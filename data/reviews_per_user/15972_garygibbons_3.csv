Skyfall," Now Pay Attention 007!
","Since watching the movie I have read with eager anticipation the reviews for Skyfall both here & in the press. I must agree with the consensus in stating this is a very good Bond movie & a worthy addition to the series, but NOT the best in my humble opinion.The plot is simple with the basis of the story linked to a theft of a list of fields agents, both CIA & MI5 (shades of Mission Impossible & the NOC list) perpetrated by a cyber villain (Goldeneye) who has a shady history with M. Our villain, both camp & sinister, seeks revenge for a previous wrongdoing by M. Javier Bardem relishes his role & delivers a truly memorable Bond baddie. We like our Bond baddies to look the part and have an almost 'cartoon like' quality about them. Raoul Silva, Bardem, has a sinister yet sympathetic quality which reminds me of the Joker in the Batman series.We see Bond face the demons of his own past whilst rescuing M from hers, the great Judy Dench on form as usual. The movie is just over two hours long but certainly didn't seem it as Sam Mendes carries us through this highly enjoyable action thriller effortlessly. The cinematography is fantastic with sumptuous sets & beautiful location shots.Daniel Craig has found his Bond and delivers a very assured performance and even delivers a few well timed one liners along the way. He still has the hard edge we have seen in the previous outings but this time allowed some humour to creep in. The scene with Bond & M in the DB5 will bring a smile to all cinema-goers faces. Berenice Marlohe is gorgeous as Severine but unfortunately has as much screen time as Teri Hatcher did....if you know what I mean? Naomie Harris as Eve (surname withheld) has an awkward relationship with Bond but why that is is addressed at the end of the movie. Ben Wishaw, the new Q, was another risk which in my eyes pays off well. Q being a genius geek of a lad may ruffle the feathers of die hard Bond fans but watch the movie & see how well it works.So why isn't it the 'best' Bond in my opinion. That lies in the third act, the final main scene. Although tense, action packed and emotional it wasn't a Bond ending in my eyes. I'm all for the big sets and bigger explosions with Bond at the centre of it all. Don't get me wrong it was a very good ending but more Hitchcock than Bond more Batman than Bond.I also still have one more question.....'what happened to the list of agents that started the movie off?'. I enjoyed Casino Royale the more I watched it so an 8/10 from a first viewing is high praise indeed for Skyfall. Perhaps when I've seen it another two or three times that rating may increase!And finally.....I like Adele's theme and I think Thomas Newman is a superb composer. Can we have David Arnold back however? He more than anyone is as close to the wonderful John Barry as we've got!",8,2,8,28 October 2012
The Hunger Games," Running Man Meets Whoville!
","This is going to be a very short and to the point review!It amazes me how low the powers that be will go to turn a fast buck (I'm English but assume that's the right phrase). Basically we have a movie about minors having the honour of killing each other! Murdering kids is now some form of entertainment?My wife read the book and I happened to buy the DVD, not having a clue as to it's storyline, assuming she would like it. We watched it a week or so ago and I was appalled that the concept was deemed entertaining!Devotees of the movie I'm sure will hide behind the fact it's fantasy....I for one do not fantasise about watching children kill each other!I am not a prude, I enjoy movies such as Predator, most of the action genre and as another example thought the cartoon violence of The Expendable 1 & 2 entertaining.If it were the other way around and the book was a bi-product of the movie then I'm sure it would remain on the shelves!!",1,7,13,23 January 2013
Casino Royale," Bond IS Back
","Yesterday was humble pie time for me after watching 2 hours plus of first class entertainment. I will confess to backing the CraigNotBond lobby early last year and I was WRONG! Hugh Jackman was my preference and although I still feel he would have made a superb 007, Craig deserves another chance.What Craig lacks in the movie star stakes he makes up via his acting ability. He has created a Bond closer in character than his predecessors. Don't get me wrong, Connery is still the quintessential Bond in my eyes, but Craig gets very close. Had he been closer in looks and not just the manner of Flemings Bond then I'm sure he would take the mantle of best ever Bond.Every Bond has brought a certain something to the role, Connery the poise of a panther combined with that sardonic charm, Lazenby an athleticism not seen (until now), Moore captured the suave sophistication of the man, Dalton (another fine actor) delivered a new depth to the role and Brosnan breathed new life into an ailing franchise with a studied portrayal. Daniel Craig seems to combine all of these qualities and delivers them with a wonderfully delivered performance.What we see here is a Bond with a devil may care attitude, an arrogance which slowly transforms on the screen to become a controlled menace. He dispatches justice with a steely eyed focus and, with a swagger, moves on to the next challenge.I don't want to spoil reader's enjoyment by going into a full review of the movie but there are a few observations I'd like to make.David Arnold has stepped into John Barry's shoes admirably once more and delivers a quality score. Subtle little touches in the soundtrack throughout support Bond's growth into the Bond we know and love. I particularly liked the subtle Bond riff when he dons the Tux just before the card game.Visually every set and location adds quality to the whole production. Stunning cinematography, especially the Venice scenes.Judy Dench delivers a delightful portrayal of M. Scolding Bond verbally on more than one occasion with aplomb and using a few more expletives that we've heard in the past with humorous undertones.The Bond girls are gorgeous and thankfully can actÂ…..remember Britt Ekland, Tanya Roberts? The Astons are there, although short lived and the gadgets are believable. Yes there is a healthy dose of product placement but it isn't a distraction.If I have any negative comment for the movie, following a high octane first 20 minutes, it does lull and at 144 minutes it's a little too long.Casino Royale, Bond movie aside, is a well delivered action thriller which proves that Bond IS Back.",9,1,3,17 November 2006
