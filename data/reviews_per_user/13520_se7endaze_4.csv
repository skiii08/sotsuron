The Blair Witch Project," Its uniqueness is more important that its quality....
","Anyone who has even the slightest trouble with insomnia after seeing a horror movie should stay away from The Blair Witch Project--this film will creep under your skin and stay there for days. Credit for the effectiveness of this mock documentary goes to filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, who armed three actors (Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, and Josh Leonard) with video equipment, camping supplies, and rough plot outlines. They then let the trio loose into the Maryland woods to improvise and shoot the entire film themselves as the filmmakers attempted to scare the crap out of them. Gimmicky, yes, but it worked For those of you who were under a rock when it first hit the theaters, The Blair Witch Project tracks the doomed quest of three film students shooting a documentary on the Burkittsville, Maryland, and legend of the Blair Witch. After filming some local yokels (and providing only scant background on the witch herself), the three, led by Heather (something of a witch herself), head into the woods for some on-location shooting. They're never seen again. What we see is a reconstruction of their 'found' footage, edited to make a barely coherent narrative. After losing their way in the forest, whining soon gives way to real terror as the three find themselves stalked by unknown forces that leave piles of rocks outside their campsite and stick-figure art projects in the woods. The masterstroke of the film is that you never actually see what's menacing them; everything is implied, and there's no terror worse than that of the unknown. If you can wade through the tedious arguing--and the shaky, motion-sickness-inducing camera-work--you'll be rewarded with an oppressively sinister atmosphere and one of the most frightening denouements in horror-film history.The film does hold up. Its uniqueness is more important that its quality, but there's not a lot unique out there. This is one of those great Saturday-wanna-scare-the-crap-out-of-you-Night movies, a true ghost story I severely enjoyed this one",8,0,2,19 June 2005
Shaun of the Dead," British horror fans, and Horror fans around the world, can thank Mr. Romero...
","Discussion of what albums can be sacrificed, such as the soundtrack to Batman, are just one of the many hysterical segments in this film.Unlike the typical, Pace-fading tempo, British films are used to dishing out to their viewers.... this one actually gains momentum as it 'Knocks-off' character favorites along the way. This film should please fans of both, Mr. Bean / Monty Python pun humor, and the 'EEWWW! That was GROSS!!!' humor as well. Also, I love how the Winchester Pub gives Shaun and Ed new goals, aside their current content for life, which is: Killing Zombies and Drinking Beer.British horror fans, and Horror fans around the world, can thank Mr. Romero for capitalizing on the low-budget horror industry...... which spawns this creative and insightful comedy.... Unlike the Evil Dead Films, this horror comedy actually puts zombies and gore on a back-burner, and brings forth some wicked humor and splendid performances...All in all, it's a very funny, great time!!!",8,1,2,25 May 2005
Blade," 'Blade' is perhaps not great art, but certainly great fun...
","Wesley Snipes stars as Blade, an immortal 'day-walker' who considers it his mission to hunt vampires. Blade's mother was bitten by a vampire during her pregnancy, which passed a variety of powers on to her son. Blade benefited from the best attributes of both vampires and humans, and grew up to be a vampire hunter in order to avenge the death of his mother, and to find the means of becoming 'human' once more. Snipes does his best 'Terminator' impression by hiding almost all of Blade's emotions beneath a macho facade. This approach works on a certain level  it makes Blade a more dangerous and ambiguous figure, but it also prevents the audience from connecting with him. But, before he can dream of becoming completely human, he must deal with the new leader of the vampire nation, Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff), whose stated goal is nothing less than the complete domination of the world. Despite being over-the-top, Stephen Dorff fails to imbue Frost with the ferocity necessary to make him a memorable villain. Blade is aided by Adam Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), who provides him with a range of high-tech solutions. The grizzled sidekick lays down a nice character role performance for the future installments.N'bushe Wright is simply boring. The supporting cast includes the internationally known Udo Kier as the vampire whose position Frost inherits, and ex-porn star Traci Lords as Frost's long-toothed mistress.A fine combination of action, science fiction and horror, 'Blade' is one of the best comic book adaptations to date. The performances in Blade are serviceable. While hardly deep or cerebral, they manage to capture much of the spirit of the original comic book and succeed in not turning it into a children's cartoon. The film provides plenty of action and effects, fights and blood. The violence is successfully broken up with a variety of one-liners and humor.The atmosphere is so well-developed that it's easy to forget how derivative and monotonous the plot is, and to get lost in the darkness of Blade's paranoid, vampire-filled world. Blade is fueled by a kinetic energy, and there are scenes, such as the opening dance club sequence, the 'Blood Bath', that functions as exotic, erotic assaults on the senses. Ultimately, that all turns out to be a rich icing on a half-baked cake. Blade has the capacity to dazzle, but it also will leave many viewers dissatisfied. Stylish and entertaining, 'Blade' is perhaps not great art, but certainly great fun.",5,2,4,19 June 2005
Resident Evil," Thanks, but I'll stick to the game
","This film opens in the 'Hive', the massive underground research complex run by the Evil Umbrella Corporation. A vile containing a deadly virus is broken and it sifts it's way throughout the entire complex, wiping out everyone. This, if in all reality, would not have happened if the Hive had not been entirely connected by the ventilation system. But hey, I guess it goes to show, Military intelligence isn't too high in the movie world either.Casting includes Milla Jovovich as Alice, who was found in the mansion suffering from amnesia, but coincidently remembers how to kick ass, and looks great doing it. Michelle Rodriguez is Rain, by far the toughest and sexiest member of the task force sent into the Hive to check things out. A female commando, who knows how to get it done, go figure. And then there are the other guys in the cast who survive past the 30-minute mark, but they're just the bait for the baddies. Most of the movie consists of the main characters shouting orders, and occasionally getting hoarded by zombies. Oh, and there's a deadly laser beam, which is fun to watch for the most unexpected decapitations I've seen. However, I was impressed with the licker, and the 'Cujo' wanna-be zombie dogs.Director Paul Anderson gives the film a nice Holly' gloss finish. And the music, industrial metal which got very annoying, managed to drown out some of the lousy dialogue. This was more of an action movie than the horror flick I expected, it doesn't even stride with George A. Romero's zombie films.The one thing that messed up the movie for me was the unnecessary last scene that sets up the sequel; you already know (if you've played the game) that one was coming. Thanks, but I'll stick to the game",5,0,0,28 December 2005
