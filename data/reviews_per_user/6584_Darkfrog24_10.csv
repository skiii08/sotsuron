"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Silly, stupid and full of toilet humor, but funny overall
","This struck me as a good film to watch with teen-aged cousins or other younger relatives. This is not nearly as funny, intelligent or well-timed as Mr. Pegg's other films, but it has enough redeeming qualities to be worth watching.I found the ending to be just realistic enough to be enjoyable. The protagonist undergoes a transformation, but not so much of one as to seem hackneyed (I'm looking at YOU, Bell, Book and Candle!).The shining star of this movie is Mr. Azaria's performance. He manages to portray a hateful character while still being an absolute delight to watch.",4,2,7,5 April 2008
Star Trek," That was the Batman Begins of Star Trek
","That was the Batman Begins of Star Trek. They even found a way to explain the retcons that 1. fits organically into the plot and 2. would appeal to Star Trek fans and 3. leaves them completely covered. Roddenberry would be proud.That alone would make this movie memorable, but not only does J.J. Abrams manage to pack a lot of action into this film without detracting from the story, but he also manages to give each of the characters in the ensemble enough screen time to come across in a satisfying way without making the film seem unbalanced.Ordinarily, I don't think that most movies need sequels, but this one would manage one very well. It wouldn't require the characters to unlearn any of the lessons they learned in the first movie.",10,7,20,8 May 2009
Underworld," It shouldn't be good, but it is.
","Let's face it, this movie has a stupid premise. Vampires and werewolves fighting? Okay... What this movie teaches us, it seems, is that if the writing is good, the story is good, the plot twists are good and the characters are good, it's okay if the premise is a little stupid.Underworld surprised me, and that doesn't generally happen. The non-spiritual take on vampires and werewolves was a real treat, and Michael's flashbacks remind me of nothing so much as Niel Gaiman at his best, but I'd have to say that the most appealing part was the almost skeletal way they played the romance: The hero and heroine have only known each other for two days and... act like they've only known each other for two days? Brilliant! It made what was there so much more resonant and believable and highlighted the paranoia of certain other characters.The biology referenced in this film was close to accurate, although not perfect. For Hollywood, it was Mensa.There was one thing that I found particularly jarring, though: 'Lycan,' sounds too much like 'lichen' for the name to be particularly intimidating. That and the ending was a little bit too 'Hulk smash!'Word of advice: I've seen the regular cut and the extended cut, and I have to recommend the former. Many of the 'extra' scenes were good, but they just didn't fit into the whole.",9,2,3,7 November 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," This is the first half of one great movie.
","First order of business, YES you should stay through the credits. There is a short tidbit scene at the end.In the film's last minutes, I felt very cheated, but right up until then I was cheering my head off. This is every bit as sharp and funny as the first, with amazing dialogue and creature effects that had me shaking with delight.This movie actively rewards the fans who memorized every last line and plot twist of the first. In fact, I highly recommend watching Black Pearl a day or two before seeing this flick. Pay attention to the rum and the sword! Dead Man's Chest has one gaping flaw: It doesn't stand on its own. This isn't one movie, really, but rather the first half of a movie. A sequel, even the inside second of a trilogy, should have its own beginning, middle and end and this one really doesn't. I only hope that all the marvelous questions raised will be answered in the third film.",7,0,1,9 July 2006
Van Helsing," My eyes! My eyes!
","I'll save you the trouble of watching this movie in two words: DORKULA LIVES!This is one of the worst things I've seen, EVER. It knocked John Carpenter's Vampires out of the #1 spot on my list of Worst Vampire Movies I've Ever Seen ...and I watched Dracula 3000! This movie has a good cast. I am amazed that there is so little good acting. It's been a long time since anything I saw in a film had me wanting to claw out my eyes. Half the reason I didn't was that doing so would require me to stop covering my ears. The dialogue was dreadful, but not nearly so dreadful as the cringingly stereotypical fake accents sported by half the cast.Kate Beckinsale's character is supposed to be a gypsy, but neither she nor her brother not her entourage dress, act or seem to think like Roma. The word is just tossed in there. It would have been much better, I think, to refer to them as Romanian nobles and leave it at that. It doesn't help that she looks like she's dressed up as a pirate for Halloween.Most of this movie had me wondering just how stupid the writers think their viewers are, but the ending topped it all. Since there are probably people out there who would enjoy this movie -- though I have little idea why -- I won't give details on it, but let's just say I was worried that the Care Bears were going to show up.Redeeming points: Frankenstein is done fairly well, as are the patterns of movement on the vampires as they fly. This movie has the best werewolf visuals I've ever seen. There are also hints of a good story going on in the background with the mystery of Van Helsing's unknown past, but instead of playing these up as a real subplot, this movie buries them under piles and piles of some of the stupidest writing I've ever seen.",1,2,5,9 November 2005
X-Men: The Last Stand," What's with the complaining? This wasn't bad at all.
","What's everyone complaining about? That wasn't that bad.I had managed to sneak a bento box into the movie theater, and I sat down quite confident that by the end of the evening, I would have an answer to the age old question: Can one commit honorable seppuku with a pair of mall chopsticks (Y/N)? Also, in the dark, I mistook my entire supply of wasabi for an innocent piece of avocado.To my great relief, that was in fact, my worst experience in the theater that night.It has moments that are overdone and stupid, but not much more than the first two flicks. If there was a moment that was over the top it was Magneto's cavalier attitude to Mystique's 'infection.' She might have been 'one of them,' but he of all people knew that their enemies would not make that distinction.There are new mutants introduced, but not so many that it becomes confusing. They are all established very well, very quickly, and in due proportion to their importance to the plot. No, the humor isn't exactly the same, but it is still there. This isn't a movie that tries to play it straight and fails. This isn't some random piece of fluff either. Archangel might have been more of a device than a character, but his effect on others is handled perfectly.This is at least a B+ movie, with an A-list cast. The best moment, however, is the absolute last scene. I won't even say it with a spoiler warning; it's just too good.Oh and they got the kid from Stargate to play Leech! I was waiting for him to tell Storm that she needed a new toaster.",6,0,1,14 September 2006
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," True to the book and reasonably fun to watch
","People who liked either the first movie or the New Moon book will probably have a great time at this movie. People who didn't like them still might have fun laughing at the moments of glorious teenaged awkwardness--Michael Welch returns as the hilariously down-on-his-luck Mike Newton.As a sequel, New Moon is excellent. It maintains the same tone as the first movie, smooths out some of the rough edges and builds from there. On its own it's mostly quite enjoyable to watch. There were lots of intentional and unintentional humor and of course the movie takes only a bit of the edge off the book's more than slightly unbalanced story structure.Things that impressed me? FIGHT SCENES. They actually let us see Felix toss Edward around like a rag doll. And they might have robbed us of the sight of spooky elder vampires petrifying in their old age, but they did let us see Edward's head literally crack like an eggshell as he gets slammed into the floor tiles.I also like that they expanded Alice's role and showed Bella actually missing someone in addition to Edward. I really wish that both the books and movies had gotten more into the Bella-Alice friendship. Also, the idea that a person's spouse is the only relationship they need is a relatively new one. If even a romantically obsessed book series like Twilight can focus on the fact that Bella is reacting to the entire Cullen clan and not just Edward, then maybe we're moving toward a healthier idea of what love is.Also, Michael Sheen is the champion of creepy. Sorry, Bill Nighy; he played Aro before you played Greyback! My final recommendation? Go see this movie with a big crowd for all the squealing and shouting at the screen. It's like a floor show but with body glitter.",5,45,90,20 November 2009
Inside Man," That was the Maltese Falcon
","Be advised, this movie is plot driven, NOT character driven. If you're looking for rapport, look elsewhere. If you want a twisty, original heist flick, then tune in.Writing, directing, acting, pacing, visuals, plot... This movie had nothing below A-grade. This was a seamless knitting together of thought and love and hate. This movie's emotional triggers are perfectly wired.Imagine all the hype that's been written about Maltese Falcon. Now imagine a movie that lives up to that.Denzel Washington occupies but does not over-dominate the screen. Christopher Plummer's and Clive Owen's characters both manage to exude good, evil, guilt and respect. A person can spend decades trying to climb out, only to be drawn back into the fold. This isn't good vs. evil. This is good vs. temptation.This was the best movie I've seen in years. I don't think I'll re-watch it for a few more. A favorite movie is like a good book, but this is a mystery. I need to forget before I'm reminded.",9,3,6,27 March 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," A fine adaptation of book to film
","There is something that I learned -- happily -- before going to see the first Lord of the Rings movie and it's served me well ever since. When I sit down and watch the lights go dim, I must recite to myself, 'It's not going to be as good as the book. They have to change things to make a movie. I'm going to have a great time anyway, but it's not going to be just the same as the book.' They took things out. They added other things. Overall, the effect was quite charming and worked well in a non-print medium. Sure, there were parts during which I was saying to myself, 'Hey! They left that part unexplained,' but there were others during which I was more, 'Wow. I am SO glad they removed that character.' (People who have seen 'Chamber of Secrets' will know of whom I speak.)This is perhaps demonstrated in the scenes which deal with Harry's anxiety over asking a girl to the Yule Ball. There were moments in the book which had me laughing out loud, but they just would not have worked on screen. That is not to say that I wasn't doubled over in the theater.Overall, this reminded me of the silver angel sugar bowl in the early chapters of Johnny Tremain. The filmmakers did not copy the details exactly, but the result was spectacular.",7,0,0,17 December 2005
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Some good moments but shares Man of Steel's pacing problems
","This movie had some very neat visuals, a few of them ripped right from the pages of some of Batman's most memorable comics, and the dynamic between Superman and Lois was great to watch. However, I kept waiting for the story to start. For all its explosions, this movie had me checking my watch.For a movie that is explicitly about Superman and Batman fighting, it skimps on foundation for why they would fight. The source material has plenty.While this is an improvement over Man of Steel (no weird birth scenes) I found myself comparing it to Superman Returns, which, for all its flaws, really felt like a Superman movie. The question of what gives Superman the right to interfere in human affairs, which is a major issue in Batman vs Superman, is there answered very simply--because people keep asking him to.Although Wonder Woman held her own, I would have liked to have seen more of her character and less sexy posing in skimpy costumes.If you have more than two dream sequences, you need a rewrite.",6,6,12,25 March 2016
