Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," More a satire on the US than on Kazakhstan
","This film does what it sets out to do  make an audience laugh. They laughed here in Helsinki on the opening night  not uncontrollably, not immoderately, but they did laugh consistently and there was indeed a great deal to laugh at. If there are targets for satire here, they are first and foremost the Americans that Borat meets, and secondarily western stereotypes of emerging nations such as Kazakhstan. It's perhaps a little hard on the Kazakhs that their homeland was chosen to give birth to Borat, and their government is reportedly up in arms about it. They might do well to reflect on the old adage that all publicity is good publicity, and on the fact that the treatment of them is affectionate in its way.What did surprise a little is how well many of the targets emerged. Some elderly bigots were neatly and rightly skewered on their own prejudices. Various 'experts' on this and that were shown up to be vacuous, as you would expect. I found one scene, set at a family guest house, unnecessarily cruel, and I'm knocking a point off for that. And some groups and individuals came out of it really well  such as the Pentecostalists and the driving instructor  and I'm putting a point back on for that, for taking the smooth with the rough. A good evening's entertainment, and Sacha Baron Cohen is surely one of the world's greatest comic actors and I hope he will continue to find outlets for his immense talents. But overall there were too few surprises and too many jokes with only one dimension for it to become a classic  though the dinner party and the nude wrestling will linger in my mind for a long time to come.

Match Point," Unconvincing on every level
","In this film Woody Allen does for present day London roughly what Dick van Dyke did for cockney chimney sweeps in Mary Poppins - that is, strike an almost unending series of false notes. Jonathan Rhys Myers plays Chris Wilton, a tennis pro whose every gesture suggests privilege; we are asked to believe he comes from a poor Irish background. The Hewitts, the family with whom he becomes involved, do not work as individuals, and do not work as a family. So many little things aren't right. Mrs H dresses like a woman a couple of social classes below her, for example. The portrayal of business life is also a travesty. Mr H has the general demeanour of an antiques dealer, but the plot has him run a string of companies (called Hewitt Inc, though of course British firms are plcs) where he has no problems installing his son-in-law and giving him the sort of car and chauffeur that would not normally go to anyone below board level in a FTSE-100 firm - if then. Daughter Chloe simply sets up an art gallery in one of the smartest parts of London - Emily Mortimer who plays her and comes from this sort of milieu really should have known better.As for the plot, others have commented on its shortcomings. Still, however hard to believe, it did carry me through to the end. And some of the cast and settings were nice to look at, and the sound track wasn't unpleasant - though I couldn't really work out the justification for it. I can imagine at least two levels of awfulness worse than this, so I'll give it three out of ten. (Why, incidentally, is there no zero ranking?)",2,20,31,28 February 2006
The Piano," Clunky symbolism - symbolising nothing
","Over a decade has passed since I saw this little stinker in Tokyo and I still resent the time I wasted on it, but not as much as I resent the praise with which it has been garlanded. It's dreadful. The Piano is rescued from a shipwreck, in perfect tune, and Holly Hunter plays Michael Nyman numbers on it. She can't be bothered to talk for some reason. She inspects Harvey Keitel's bottom. Some Maori girls appear in Victorian costume to show how oppressive the colonisers were. That's most of what I remember and it's too much. It's presumably meant to mean something but it fails. The landscapes were nice, though.All in all, a model of all that is worst about art cinema and an argument for going to see blockbusters or reading a book or tapping out some hymns on a tinny piano, which is what the Holly Hunter character would have played had this film attempted to connect with reality on any level.",1,45,92,28 October 2006
