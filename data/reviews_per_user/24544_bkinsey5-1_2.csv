The Hangover," Old School 2: Same Old Tricks
","I did not have very high expectations going into this film. Like many others, I figured that the previews accounted for most of the humor. I was wrong in that assumption. However, much of the humor was extremely predictable and many of the scenes resembled what you can find in Old School, a much MUCH better movie overall. This is especially apparent in the wedding reception scene when the same wedding singers from Old School (which I have no problem with) are performing. If you watch the father of the bride (Jeffrey Tambor) as he reacts to the singer's own special version of the song, you'll find that it is eerily similar to 'Frank the Tank's' reaction to the same situation in Old School. I can't hate on Todd Phillips too much because I think he makes good movies, but I really wish he would have made this movie a bit more original with less predictable scenes. 5/10 since I've seen Old School 7/10 if I hadn't",5,1,3,5 August 2009
Wanted," wayyyy over the top
","I didn't expect to see realistic action scenes going into this movie, but when I actually did see it...whoa! Yes, all the incredible stunts and assassinations they perform in this movie are extremely entertaining, but the accompanying storyline was very sub-par in my opinion. Getting assassination orders from 'the loom of fate?' That's just silly. Not to mention exploding rats, c'mon. What were the writers on when they put this into the story? The point in the movie that really pushed it into the 'bad movie' category for me was the scene where the train cars were falling off the bridge. I know this is a movie that defies the laws of physics, but how anyone escaped with their lives after that scene baffles me. Fox's final set of executions was just icing on the terrible movie cake. If it weren't for the incredible action sequences and screenplay, I would actually be mad that I paid to see this movie.",4,2,8,8 July 2008
