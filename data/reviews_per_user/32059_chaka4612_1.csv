Deja Vu," Great Movie
","When I saw the original trailer it looked like a typical CSI type of murder investigation mystery. It wasn't until later that I realized that it was a science fiction movie. Despite seeing the average rating for this movie I wasn't expecting too much. I was impressed that the movie and Denzel's performance came across with enough of a feel of reality to the first part of the film that you really get sucked in and intrigued. It allowed me to suspend my disbelief for the remainder of the movie and go with it even though I knew it was impossible. The scenes with the hi tech surveillance reminded me of Minority Report. Usually I rip apart all the things in a movie that are obviously fake, but I think this movie did a great job with all the intricate details and made it seem realistic (despite being completely impossible). I was also impressed with the attention to detail in each scene and how the clues interacted as the story unfolded. This is obviously a complicated story to follow and I would love to see it again to pick up on any other details I missed.",8,0,1,14 January 2007
