Ford v Ferrari," the Best Film of the Year!

Joker," Went for a many time to watch this movie i love Hollywood movie specially joker
","I get why some people hate this . It's because of the political message and how some people think that you need get empathy for Arthur's madness. But come on that is not the point and it will never be. Enjoy this masterpiece because Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips overdid themselves with this movie . The acting,music and cinematography are just amazing ! Please enjoy the movie without overthinking it.",10,2,6,19 November 2019
