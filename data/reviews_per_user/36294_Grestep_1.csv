The Blair Witch Project," A Totally Original Movie
","Blair Witch Project is the best movies I have seen in a long time.  It was by far the most original movie ever made.  As far as scary movies go, it was the scariest I have ever seen.  One of the things that made it scary was the use of the cameras.  I am sure that if it was filmed on the film that is used with regular movies, I don't think it would have been half as scary. Well, that is all I have to say about this movie.  If you haven't seen it yet go see it.",Null,1,2,19 August 1999
