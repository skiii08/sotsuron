The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," How Not To Split a Book into Two
","I am very disappointed in 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1'. So angry, frustrated and furious that in fact I wanted to forget I had ever taken the time to see it. Which is why this review is four months late. I've always considered myself an avid fan of the series and I still do. When I saw the first film I felt the need to read all of the books. Then came the film adaptation of 'Catching Fire'. I loved it and will continue to watch it throughout the rest of my life. But I remained split in two about whether I would like 'Mockingjay' in the weeks leading up to its release. Francis Lawrence directed the previous instalment, but I do not consider myself to be a fan of the last book. Would splitting it in half detract its flaws or add to them. Unfortunately, it piles them on and there was me thinking the book had its fair share of problems, wait until you see the film.This time around Katniss Everdeen having survived two rounds of the fatal Hunger Games is to lead a revolution. The Capitol and President Snow have Peeta and Johanna captive and are seemingly brainwashing Peeta for their cause. However, things are going to be anything but easy, except easy money for Hollywood that is. Katniss initially refuses to join the Rebel's cause and become the Mockingjay. A decision the President of District 13, Alma Coin takes with anger. Coin is portrayed by Julianne Moore who gives a worthwhile performance. She shares plenty of screen time with Plutarch Heavensbee played (in one of his last roles) by Philip Seymour Hoffman. The two provide perhaps the only bearable element of 'Mockingjay', believable and interesting performances from the both of them.Eventually, Katniss leads a rescue mission to bring back the captives and take revenge on the Capitol; except the last part does not even happen. Instead Francis Lawrence gives us the cinematic equivalent to watching grass grow. For all of its 123 minutes, make no mistake, this Hunger Games is one dull, dreary dragged out affair. With no real beginning, middle and end. It feels like a botched job. We watch and wait restless in our seats with bated breath, waiting for something, anything in fact of consequence to happen. All this build up and nothing. No tension, no real drama and no emotional heft or pay off. I would rather fight to the death in the arena than watch Part 1 again.The problem does not squarely rest on the Director's shoulders though. The writing, cinematography, music, most of the acting and the plot all contribute to give audiences one of the worst major releases from Hollywood in 2014. Save for 'Transformers: Age of Extinction'.'Mockingjay' is written in such a way that it drags out scenes for far too long just to pass the two hour mark. There is a scene, I am not kidding that lasts for a good minute or more, where Katniss inexplicably shines a torch at a cat and watches as it tries to attack it. She laughs. We don't. Hollywood does. This is clearly for the cutting room floor and any great Director would know this. Lawrence does not have a clue. Even the cinematography is as bland as they come. The whole film is bathed in shades of grey and any colour is washed out in favour of murky blues and dull blacks. It is a very depressing experience to watch 'Mockingjay'. Especially when you realise that Katniss only fires one arrow, which is the films only legitimate action.James Newton Howard phones it in using his music cues from the previous instalments, he should think of himself as a disgrace. Sadly, Jennifer Lawrence is no good moping, crying and whinging; wherever the old Lawrence is I want her back now! To cap it all off, the film could have been finished in twenty minutes. I am worn out now and I know you don't need me to tell you to avoid this film and to not be fooled by cynical marketing strategies from Hollywood and its hack Directors.In 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1' Francis Lawrence provides the fans with everything that they do not want; a disengaging story, mainly awful performances, dreary cinematography, repetitive music and plodding directing. It is in my eyes time for a revolution against bad film making and bloated runtimes. I have a message for Francis Lawrence if you direct another film we will boycott it.",7,5,8,6 April 2015
The Incredible Hulk," A Wholly Unnecessary Reboot
","Whilst 'Hulk' focused on character relationships, Louis Leterrier's 'The Incredible Hulk' puts the action upfront, almost outright ignoring any traces of character depth. The reboot as a result feels too numb and empty to enjoy on its own mindless B-movie monster terms.Scientist Bruce Banner is in hiding in South America, trying to find a cure for his condition, whilst evading the US military who believe him to be a potential threat. But soon Banner is forced into changing into his alter ego, in order to stop a powerful enemy.To be fair to 'The Incredible Hulk', it was already at a disadvantage, released between two of the best super-hero films of all time; 'Iron Man' and 'The Dark Knight'. Where those films pushed the boundaries of the genre and shattered audience expectations, 'The Incredible Hulk' feels far too complacent and worried to take risks, which would benefit the overall quality of the film.Edward Norton as Bruce Banner fails to generate enough interest in his character. He is too calm and never appears to have a darker side to his personality. Liv Tyler does not fare any better as Betty Ross, her lines whispered and lacking any chemistry or spark between Norton. This is unfortunate because we begin to care less about the characters as a result. They cannot go beyond their stereotypes, Banner the nerdy scientist and Ross the emotional, ever loving girlfriend. Tim Roth as the villainous Emil Blonsky is thankfully as deranged and unhinged as possible, so his scenes come as a breath of fresh air, as one of the few things that the film does right.A significant improvement in this instalment though is the CGI. In 'Hulk' the effects looked unnatural and off-putting; whereas in 'The Incredible Hulk', the effect of the raging green monster looks seamless. The Hulk blends in with the environment and never looks out of place for a second. If only the director had applied as much thought for the story and characters as he did for the CGI.Considering that the main appeal of a film that revolves around the Hulk is the fight scenes, it is astonishing that none of them remain in my memory for long. Perhaps, it is the fact that they are undistinguishable from one another and lack the thrills of the better structured 'Iron Man' in comparison.As the second film in Marvel's Cinematic Universe, it's astonishing that 'The Incredible Hulk' did not lay waste to Marvel's plans for the future. It remains a severe misjudgement that rests far too heavily on action and explosions, than ideas and characters. We as an audience deserve more, if the super hero genre is to stay fresh and thriving. No doubt it will, but films with the same mentalities as 'The Incredible Hulk' can't be helping.Leterrier's reboot will please Marvel die hards, but those that crave substance amongst ongoing chaos and destruction, will be feeling that this Hulk is anything but incredible.",6,0,1,28 September 2015
Skyfall," Shaken, not stirred
","After the awful plunder and fall of one of the biggest grossing franchises, Bond fans were undeniably distressed. Quantum of Solace had undone everything that Casino Royale had done right; it was a Bond film that was bigger and better, it even rivalled Sean Connery's best effort 'Goldfinger'. Despite the lack of gadgets in CR everything was astounding and Bond fans were looking forward to the next instalment and the first direct sequel (although the character from Dr.No, Sylvia Trench reappears in From Russia With Love; this was not a proper sequel that followed on from the original).However when released in 2008, Bond fans thought the franchise was over and mates would ask and wonder why it was as bad as they had heard it was. Was it the acting? No. Was it too long? No.What was it? (This can be answered in less than a sentence) It has a plot that only Bruce Willis or Jason Bourne could care about. It feels like The Bourne Insanity. (Basically the villain wants to stop water coming in to Bolivia. Bond fans thought it was a lie. No! They shouted in despair, but that was it. This left the fans in outrage: Neil Purvis and Robert Wade should be shot dead. The Bond franchise was dead in the mud and with nothing left for the fans to do they re-watched Casino Royale. Even that though lost its enduring appeal; they needed a new bond film, a better bond villain and plot.So in October comes the long awaited entry to the Bond franchise: Skyfall. Would it entertain?Would Q return?And is it at least watchable?All of the above can be ticked off with pleasure. Skyfall delivers and it passes and sails with flying colours. OK so Eve is a bit annoying and has very little on screen chemistry with Bond and it feels forced. However, the many other aspects of the film will even please the most angered and bad tempered critic out there. Want evidence: it currently has an 8.1 score and is on the Top 250, on Rotten Tomatoes it has a 92% approval rating from over 250 critics, still not satisfied? OK then I will elaborate.Throughout the film Bond's pain is felt, he's unsure if he has still got what it takes to be a super spy and stop the villain Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem) from hunting down M. Silva's motive for this is that he believes M betrayed him, his cyanide capsule did not work. Therefore, he believes that she must pay and so will MI6 for his suffering and torture. Bardem is the ultimate Bond villain bringing passion and vengeance to the role, his role is probably the best to date and therefore Silva is on par with Bond villains like Auric Goldfinger. Q makes a welcome return even if he only supplies Bond with two different gadgets, one of which is only a distress signal and hardly worth much if any of Bond's time. However, the negatives are all forgotten about with so many positives and strengths within the film it's hard to pinpoint the key elements and moments. Although not as good as Golfinger or On Her Majesty's Secret Service, this is still one of Bond's best.As Bond girls go Eve is quite lame, but the surprise in this film is that it departs from the average and by the books Bond formula. M is the Bond girl in this instalment. As such we see her fear, even more swearing and how she reflects on her 'sins' as put by Silva. This is an odd turn, surprising yet it still works well within the film and leads to a sad yet spectacular finale.In this film everything is there: the action, the beautiful women, the gadgets (sort of), the villain, the cars and the exotic locations. The finale will never disappoint even on a second viewing. Even though the majority of the film is set in London it ties in well with the Olympics this year and makes us all proud to be British. After fifty years, Sam Mendes proves that nobody does it better than Bond and never will do. Bond fans rejoice; the Bond Ultimatum so to speak is here!P.S. Wade and Purvis all is forgiven!",9,1,9,21 November 2012
John Wick," A Pure Undiluted Shot of Adrenaline
","Keanu Reeves has not been in the lead role of an amazing action film for some time. In fact I would go as far back as 1999's 'The Matrix', not including its silly sequels. That film showed audiences and critics alike that there was still freshness and room for expansion regarding the science fiction genre. Likewise, 'John Wick' has the same effect on the action genre. The last film truly off of the rails and full of excitement was 1988's 'Die Hard'. Yes, 'John Wick' is that awesome.John Wick is an ex-hit-man. He is overcome with grief when his wife dies from a fatal illness. Knowing that she has little time left, she leaves John a gift to remind him of her. A dog, Daisy. Within the next few days they form a close bond. Alas, it is not to be. Masked Russian gangsters break into his house, killing his dog and stealing his car. It is time for John Wick to take his revenge.If 'John Wick' sounds like the next 'Taken' film or average revenge tale, then you are mistaken. This film has style, energetic and frenetic fights as well as an actual plot. Think of it like 'Kill Bill' with Keanu Reeves replacing Uma Thurman in the title role. John Wick may not be as outrageous as the work of Quentin Tarantino. But it is far more daring and fun than the recent batch of action films from Hollywood's generic production line. This is what makes John Wick stand out from the crowd.Keanu Reeves in the starring role gives John Wick solemnity, thus lending him realism as opposed to Liam Neeson's Bryan Mills from 'Taken' who was stapled with clichés. We buy Reeves' character because he is a broken man with nothing left, as a result we can sympathise with him. Iosef the leader of the Russians who break into John Wick's house is played by an egotistical Alfie Allen, he makes the mistake of triggering John Wick's unstoppable anger. Iosef loses his cool real quick when he realises the gravity of what he has done. Enter his father, played by the sinister Michael Nyqvist, who shows little compassion and love for his son. Iosef strives to please him, leading to some very foolish decisions. Iosef does not think about the consequences of his actions, until it is too late and John Wick comes a calling. Willem Dafoe is never less than magnificent. His role makes an impression, he is John's trustworthy ally and gives him a purpose, when no one else in the world will.What is primarily involved in 'John Wick' and the centre of the audience's interest is the fight scenes. They take place in a variety of everyday locations. A house, nightclub, hotel, secret safe house and even briefly a church. Do not fear. Shaky cam is barely present. You will actually be able to tell who is punching who. This was clear in 'The Bourne Ultimatum' and anything but in the 'Taken' Trilogy. The action is not a rehash of the film's previous set pieces and each one is unique and wholly original in its approach. Take for example the scene in John Wick's house. The camera is locked down with wide angles. We can take in each punch, kick, stab and bullet wound with ease. 'John Wick' makes you feel alive. The set piece in the nightclub differs in style. As John Wick runs towards Iosef, the camera sways from the left to the right. It may prove disorientating to some viewers, yet you can always establish what is going on and who the enemy is. It does not prove distracting or poorly framed. I felt reborn and could revel in each detail to my heart's content.Most action films feel obligated to make it past the two hour mark. Not 'John Wick'. All the fat is trimmed off, so that only the meat and core of the film remains intact. Therefore, you are not left waiting too long for the next set piece. I do have one minor criticism of 'John Wick'. So minor in fact, that it is barely worth mentioning. The very first scene feels redundant, when you look back on the film. However, it does not hurt the film and only the most picky audience member will take issue with it.The score by Tyler Bates and Joel L. Richard compliments John Wick's uber cool clothing and look. It is in touch with the film and increases the mood and tension to a considerable degree. Undoubtedly, without this elegant score, the film would not be half as charming as it is.The cinematography is polished and sophisticated. The action takes place within the frame. This means you can stay focused without feeling ill. You only have to look at the most recent 'Taken' outing to see how poorly this can be executed.'John Wick' is a top tier action film. Filled with layered characters, confident performances, a suave score, radiant cinematography and free flowing fist fights. This is the best film of its kind since 'Die Hard' and miles ahead of 'Taken' in every aspect. If 'John Wick' does not become a franchise, then generic action flicks be warned, I am going to take my revenge upon you.",8,2,7,21 April 2015
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A Galactic Mess
","Star Wars, Star Wars what have you become? You've always been there for me through the good (Revenge of the Sith), the bad (The Phantom Menace) the unintentional laughter (Attack of the Clones) and the highs (The Empire Strikes Back). But along the way something went wrong you're not the same franchise you used to be. Whilst never entirely reliable you were something I could rest easy with particularly when a certain George Lucas was not at the creative helm. But this is different, Lucas is out of the picture forever and now you present me with this garbage from the trash compactor? Why? Why now? Star Wars should be at new heights and The Force Awakens showed us what love, care and fan service (albeit too much) could do for a franchise that was thought to have had its day. Enter Gareth Edwards, that's no Director, that's a hack! Rogue One is exactly how you would reasonably expect any Star Wars film to begin (minus the title crawl and John William's music) in Space! Jyn Erso is a rebel on a mission to grasp hold of the Death Star plans and bring the Empire crumbling down. Helpless and frail. It ends how we expect it to end, begins how we would assume it to begin. As for the middle, the plot beats can be neatly charted on a graph for sheer convenience, how kind of Edwards. It's certain that this is not your father's Star Wars, because well that would require a reasonable amount of thinking and thought processes to have taken place.I will take this moment to bring up where this film excels. Don't worry this won't take me long. The music although it pales in comparison to John William's weakest scores is still admirable, although I do tend to think great things of Michael Giacchino and sadly this does not bolster his reputation so much as hinder it. The cinematography is gorgeous, not to the extent that the originals or Episode VII were, but better than the prequels all the same. Is that high praise? I doubt it. Mads Mikkelsen although given severely little to do is intriguing enough that we want to care about him, yet due to the scripts numerous shortcomings we never in fact do. Or feel any emotion for the main characters themselves, an irksome trend with Edwards's films to be sure. Remember 2014's Godzilla? Same treatment is given to the best characters here, they are put on a backseat whilst the endless CGI drivel is chucked at the screen hoping and praying that something does indeed stick with the audience to the very end. Here's a spoiler it doesn't.That's the main gripe I have with Rogue One; not its story or its cringe inducing acting (minus the voice of James Earl Jones, thank the gods) but its characters. The group that Ersa becomes a part of is so ill defined that I thought George Lucas must have scrambled in, hijacked the script and completed rewrites. They don't even fit into specific character archetypes because quite simply they have ceased to be characters the moment they step on screen, utter some of the worst one liners in recent memory and stumble out of the frame, promptly leave the scene and try not to look too embarrassed or ashamed with themselves. At this point it's practically a panto. All glitz and glamour, forced heart and humour with no blood coursing through its veins, just dried up oil and a script that I would be surprised if they spent more than a good day on. Yeah, it's that much of a shambles. Because this is what Star Wars is under the watchful eye of the corporate giant that is Disney; manufactured by robots with fake emotion sprinkled throughout, the resemblance of some plot and a plethora of characters all of whom are the comic relief and serve one purpose. To sell more toys! This is what happens when you put the by-products of a film before the actual production itself. A mess, a disaster and something that even Yoda couldn't fix with his wide assortment of powers.I'm not expecting for anyone to heed my advice and leave Rogue One to play out its life cycle in the cinema whilst you sit back at home and watch the originals in pristine high definition picture and quality. That would be the wisest thing to do, but believe me we both know that's never going to happen. So here's what to do, watch it as soon as possible so you can be spared further pain and then watch all the others minus I, II, III. (Delete where applicable). I'm saving you a world of pain. Who wants to try a Jedi Mind trick on Disney? Maybe we can stop them from causing this disaster that they so clearly want to make. Episode VIII is a mere zap away from becoming a reality and maybe this is the point of the sequel trilogy; to be our shining beacon of hope that will redeem the standalone projects when they inevitably fail and if we are lucky flop too. As for me I'm not holding my breath. You shouldn't either.D+",4,37,78,15 December 2016
The Danish Girl," Aesthetically Pleasing, But All Too Derivative
","With all factors of the film considered The Danish Girl should be a sheer delight. On paper it's a perfect film; Tom Hooper as Director, Eddie Redmayne at the forefront of the picture and Alicia Vikander in a splendid supporting role. But in reality The Danish Girl is formulaic, unfulfilling and forgettable.Einar Wegener played with delicacy by Eddie Redmayne is a confused individual. Unable to come to terms with his sexuality, he craves to wear women's clothes. He's not even comfortable in his own skin and is about to proceed with an operation that will change his life.There are so many biopics nowadays that one has to discard the filth and meander some. The Danish Girl has both of these tragic qualities. Yet, if it had a solid script it would be a great film. There are far too many familiar lines that destroy any hope of sympathy for the flawed characters. Lines like; 'We were playing a game' 'Let's give them something special' and 'I finally feel like my true self'. Okay, I made the last one up, but you get the point.From solely a production standpoint The Danish Girl is flawless. Beautiful shots of the surrounding landscape of Denmark, sell the time period and setting of the story. The music is suitably emotional and the performances are of the highest order. But that script, the way it kills any momentum and renders all drama meaningless and uneventful. The writing remains the most important part of a biopic. I need to believe that these events really did happen. But when the script feels this contrived and fails to generate the required emotion that the writer wants me to feel, then I'm afraid I can't believe in it at all.The Danish Girl literally screams Oscar bait and melodramatic drivel. If you liked the film, then I'm happy for you. By all rights I should have fell in love with it. The film deals with a man who struggled to come to terms with his sexuality. I myself can relate to the character, having spent many years identifying myself. But in this day and age films that are merely passable and relatively harmless do not cut it anymore and The Danish Girl remains as conflicted as its central character.C",5,4,8,7 January 2016
Spider-Man 2," Spider-Man's Finest Hour or Two
","For some this review will appear contradictory as almost a year ago I stated that 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' was the greatest Spidey flick. Consider that statement promptly withdrawn. 'Spider-Man 2' tops it in every conceivable way. It is in my mind a better film than 'The Dark Knight'. 'Spider-Man 2' grips from the get go and its webbing does not loosen its hold until the end credits crawl up the screen. Even the opening titles are imaginative, clips are not shown of 2002's 'Spider-Man' and its events but comic book panels. They dazzle your eyes and keep you waiting and wondering as to how the events will unfold. Peter Parker played by a Tobey Maguire whom embodies nerdiness, has now taken up the mantel of Spider-Man and this takes precedence in his life over his college work, job and wannabe girlfriend Mary Jane Watson played by the marvellous Kirsten Dunst.Parker even struggles to stay friends with Harry Osborne played by a scene stealing James Franco, who vows that Spider-Man will pay after the events of the first film where Harry saw Spider-Man return his father's dead body to him. Parker is leading the double life but as a new villain emerges to terrorise the city of New York will he be able to protect the ones he cares about? 'Spider-Man 2' raises the bar to staggering heights, heights which even Spidey would fail to climb. What makes this sequel better than its fantastic original is not merely awesome special effects and an increase in budget. 'Spider-Man 2' is more entertaining, romantic, energetic, visually dazzling and boasts one of the best villains of Cinema since the birth of Darth Vader. Alfred Molina as Doctor Octopus or as J Jonah Jameson Editor of the Daily Bugle says Doc Ock for short. Molina gives an all-round better performance than dare I say it Heath Ledger as the Joker. Molina lends Doctor Otto Octavius much heart, emotion and gravitas which contribute to a more engaging character and a better developed one. As Octavius accepts his destiny, he falls into a world of crime which he cannot escape from. He is not a villain by choice, but by consequence. Once his science experiment goes out of control his world does too. Losing his wife does not help matters and he so strongly believes in science and his life's work that he is willing to cause the death of millions or even his own.The action scenes work so well because we actually get the sense that Spider-Man is a person in between all of this destruction. These scenes which involve a flurry of CGI wizardry see Spider-Man fling himself towards his opponent, but most importantly they look real. Even the emotional aspect is ramped up. Parker loses his job, comes ever so close to failing his college course and finds out that Mary Jane has a new lover. All of which contribute to Peter Parker losing his powers as Spider-Man in the majority of the second act. But it all makes sense. Parker is not invincible as a Super-hero; he is a real person, with real issues and real problems. All of the other Spider-Man films failed to capture this deep level of emotion and make it have an impact on Parker's life as a whole. We get a deeper knowledge of Peter's infatuation with Mary Jane. He loves her, but by the same token, knows that she will never be safe because of his crime fighting life. It is this struggle that makes this tale of heroism so much more than your average film about good versus evil and far more emotionally complex and involving as a whole.The comedy lends a light hearted feel and tone for the film, it never becomes too serious or too dark, and this is about as far as you can get from 'The Dark Knight Rises' as possible. Furthermore, it relies more on visuals and not the all too obvious humour present in the new Marc Webb films. The score itself is perfection, everything that a Superhero's theme should be and more. Danny Elfman firmly cements himself as a grand composer alongside the likes of John Williams and Howard Shore. In all honesty I could talk about this film for 127 minutes, the runtime of 'Spider-Man 2'. Do you need any more reasons to purchase this film right away? Well let me sum it all up.'Spider-Man 2' is compelling evidence that the best films don't have to be Biopics or Dramas. But films that offer character development, humour, wit, romance, action and pull on your heartstrings. 'Spider- Man 2' is the greatest Spidey flick hands down, by the longest thread of web that Spider-Man can conjure. If 'Spider- Man' is to undergo another reboot then perhaps it is time to reconsider Sam Raimi as the Director and for Tobey Maguire to don the outfit for one last spin.",10,1,4,6 April 2015
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," A Mess of A Movie
","I must admit I am somewhere at a loss of how to begin explaining my feelings of Wolverine's first solo outing in the X-Men series. It is the fourth installment and a prequel to the main trilogy that ended with The Last Stand. I always believed that the reason that prevented the first two from being the best of the superhero genre was the fact that there are too many characters to keep track of (don't even get me started on TLS). There are always characters who feel neglected and in need of more screen time. The fact is that to give all of them what they are due then the films would be in excess of three hours, and I for one do not want a superhero film of that length.It seemed that a film that would just have one main character and none of the other protagonists would be a qualified success, with a more focused film. Boy was I wrong. The film starts with Logan as a young child, he witnesses the death of his mother and through his anger and rage claws start to protrude from his skin, not made of metal but bone. This scene lacks any emotional impact (like many throughout the runtime of this film). The fact is we cannot form a bond with his mother – it all happens too soon. Compare it to the death of Bruce Wayne's parents murdered in cold blood and it pales in comparison.There are many different and interesting paths that this film could take, yet Gavin Hood and screenwriter Skip Woods seem interested in giving a dull, limp, lifeless tale that goes nowhere and achieves nothing. Heck, the audience in the first five minutes must accept that Logan just gets claws because he is angry. How did he get these claws? No idea. The film never explains this and we just have to accept it, because the plot demands that he does. Instead we get to see how Wolverine gets his jacket. Yippee. I don't want to know how Wolverine obtained one piece of clothing. Wolverine eventually undergoes an operation which gives him adamantium injected into his body. Then he forms a relationship with the most clichéd romantic interest in movie history. It is as if her character was given a list of check-boxes and the screenwriter ticked every one of them. Later, he faces one of the most dangerous villains in the X-Men series – Deadpool. Just wait till you see what they have done to him This is about as dreary as Origins of Superheroes get.However, the main problem of the film is that we never care about the main character! How can this be? They have made one of my favourite superheroes duller than ditch water. Wolverine has so much charisma, dry wit and good one liners yet the only reason he is here is for the purpose of action scenes. Within every single one of these pointless escapades, we feel strangely detached. The reason? Wolverine cannot die. In X-Men, Magneto could stop him and control the adamantium that runs through his entire body. In X2, Lady Deathstrike was made of adamantium and proved a powerful nemesis against him. But in Origins he is unstoppable. The one thing that we are told can kill him is a special bullet, which later Stryker changes his mind and somehow says it can only erase his memory which makes the entire film pointless. We already know that in X-Men; Wolverine remembers nothing, so what does this film achieve – you guessed it.This is the rock bottom for the franchise. It is a complete cash grab and not an ounce of effort has gone into this production e.g. Will.i.am is present that tells you all you need to know. Hugh Jackman tries his best as Wolverine to redeem this god-awful tale but even he cannot save it. This is the equivalent of Batman and Robin for the 21st century. Maybe, some Origins were never meant to see the light of day. An unredeemable, noisy and monstrous piece of film, this is what Superheroes were never meant to be about.",2,1,2,14 May 2014
Spotlight," Expertly Crafted with Fierce Supporting Turns from Ruffalo, McAdams and Keaton, Spotlight Demands to be seen
","'How do you say no to God?' This is the question that Spotlight at its heart battles with. The answer though is nowhere to be found. There is not a simple explanation and this is the way that Director Tom McCarthy and writer Josh Singer treat the material, with thought, care and complexity.2001. Pre 9/11. The internet is about to explode. Newspapers are seen as the lesser of the two mediums and the Boston Globe is on the brink of uncovering the truth about Catholic Priests who have been molesting and raping children for years. Everyone else turns a blind eye to the truth, including the church that silences anyone who tries to speak out against them. The Boston Globe assigns a special investigative team 'Spotlight' to help bring justice to the hundreds of victims who don't just originate from Boston, but the entire world.It would have been all too easy to lose sight of the characters in Spotlight and that was my biggest fear. However, we never lose sight of them for a moment. The main players are Walter Robinson (Keaton), Mike Rezendes (Ruffalo) and Sacha Pfeiffer (McAdams). I did not need any more convincing from Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams, that they are actors at the top of their game; especially Ruffalo who surprised me further, even after his excellent characterisation in Foxcatcher. He truly is the star of the show, subtly brilliant without drawing attention. Actors like him deserve to be commended.Where does Spotlight excel the most though? That would be the writing, separating itself from the majority of Biopics and Dramas on the market that are sloppy, predictable and quite frankly a mess. The scripting is dynamic and killer lines sprinkled throughout help convey the drama to audiences, like myself who would never have believed that such horrific events really did happen. We are reminded (but not bludgeoned over the head repeatedly) by the facts. McCarthy handles the film gracefully. Admittedly a shock, when his last project was The Cobbler.But Spotlight is absorbing cinema, that shocks to the core, never succumbing to the usual clichÃ©s, is dramatic and riveting without ever patronising its audience. When was the last time a Director achieved this with this much trust? Many other Directors would make a film that felt dramatically contrived, even though these events really did happen. The power of a great Director is to make the material excel and go beyond what could have potentially been dramatically inert and lifeless. Spotlight is always moving forward in interesting and meaningful ways. The performances and writing only account for a small percentage of the film's brilliance.At first glance Spotlight is a film shot simply without an all- encompassing cinematic feel; upon further inspection though it's a beautifully dark and sinister film. With shots that linger on the performances, always cutting away at the right moment and frames that echo the superb brilliance of the famous opening shot from The Godfather. The slow reveal. I honestly could go on and on about Spotlight because it really is a great film. It's also a rare film that changes the way you perceive the world and the people around you, without feeling exploitative. A statement that is applicable to very few of the films I have seen. Biopics do not get as captivating, thought provoking, emotional and gripping as Spotlight. Why would you miss this? It demands your attention and needs to be seen. It's a true story about real people and real problems we are still facing today, relevant now more than ever. It never feels phony, fake or begging for awards nominations (which it so rightfully deserves). It builds upon everything that comes before its 128 minute runtime and offers up a conclusion that is heart stopping. Not to mention tremendous support from Ruffalo, McAdams and Keaton who bring further emotional weight to the film. All of which contribute to Spotlight standing as one of the greatest films of the decade, if not all time.A+",9,1,1,1 February 2016
Doctor Strange," Stranger Things
","For Doctor Strange being the fourteenth outing in the Marvel Cinematic Universe you would be forgiven for wondering whether by now things had become rote, stale and all too predictable as the allotted characters slot into place. It is with great enthusiasm and joy then that I can report that this entry is bar Guardians of the Galaxy, Marvel's riskiest outing to date.Stephen Strange is an egotistical, cocky, suave son-of-a-bitch and yeah as it turns out he is also a doctor; one that only helps those that have a 100% chance of being fixed up or cured. One day though he has a terrible accident leaving his hands broken and therefore any hope of him continuing his work is soon put to rest. Upon learning of a secret temple that may be able to fix him he travels and is taught the wise old ways of an ancient being. Soon Dr Strange will be the only hope that this world has to be saved from the oncoming doom that threatens it. First things first let's get the bad out of the way and then onto the great. Rachel McAdams is fine as Christine Palmer (I had to look up her name beforehand, never a good sign) but is sadly underwritten. She has no depth, we know as much as she had a relationship with Strange, conflicted as it may have been. But we don't actually know her as a person, given this much time, eight years in fact it's sad that Black Widow remains the only female character in the Marvel Universe that has been served well. A minor quibble to be sure but the product placement in the first act at least is irritating and shoved blatantly in your face. To the point of embarrassment with Adidas and Coke being the main culprits if you require solid proof.The acting talent here though is supreme, from Cumberbatch to Mikkelson. Cumberbatch of course imbues personality and a roughness of edge to his character without borrowing too heavily from Robert Downey Jr's performance as Iron Man. You only care more about him as the film approaches its truly dazzling climax that is a wonder to behold. Mikkelson's character may not be the easiest to sympathise or come to terms with but he's always intriguing to watch (Casino Royale was proof ten years ago) so it's a shame it's taken this long again for him to come into the fold as a central villain, that get this, actually poses a threat to our heroes.The action dazzles; a mix of Star Trek's action pounding thrills and humour in the strangest of places with a dash of the visual wonder of 2001: A Space Odyssey for good measure. It must be said that it is not often if at all that I compare a Blockbuster to Kubrick's masterwork. Marvel once again defies expectations and for once a film in their universe does not climax with a gigantic blue lazer beaming up into the sky. Yes the consequences of the battle may be earth shattering but the film is too steeped in its lore and characters for it to be formulaic in its approach in the slightest. It borrows off of Inception without feeling like a rip off and mixes up the Marvel formula just enough to ensure that a feeling of seeing this all too often and before, not once, not even for a fleeting second seeps into the picture. DC could learn a trick or two from Marvel and perhaps may need to if they are to ensure their survival.Scott Derrickson is to be sure a strange (see what I did there) choice for this project, not least because the majority of films with him at the helm have been horrors and none taken to all that kindly by critics. Based on his work on Doctor Strange however, should be a primer for things to come; intelligence, craftsmanship and action handled with rare skill and offering up sympathy for its characters.Doctor Strange is best viewed off of impulse with knowing very little about the title character. Its central romance may be underwhelming but rest assured that this is the only element of the entirety of the film that disappoints. The action thrilling, the stakes personal, real and potent, the characters interesting and a film lover's wet dream come to life in terms of the visuals anyhow. If you pass up the chance to see Marvel's latest on the big screen then maybe it's time that you had your mind expanded tooÂ…A",8,27,55,27 October 2016
American Sniper," A Bland by the Numbers Biopic
","2014. It appears to be the year where dozens of films based on true events have been released. For 'American Sniper' this becomes a fatal head-shot. It draws comparison immediately to more intriguing and better-structured biopics, which it cannot compete with.It does have some good factors, which are in large part due to the leading actor Bradley Cooper. Cooper oozes swagger and charm when we see him. He is cool, calm and focused. He plays Chris Kyle who becomes increasingly haunted every time he guns down an opposing soldier or citizen. He is enlisted as a Navy SEALS Sniper. Throughout his career he was known as the deadliest American Sniper in history. During which he had 160 kills to his name and was something of a legend to the soldiers working alongside him. The look on his face after his first fatal kill stays with us long after the credits roll. This is extremely frustrating, as the majority of the film does not stick to our ribs in the way that Clint Eastwood intended.Eastwood takes up directorial duties on this film and it is clear that he is a veteran Director and completely comfortable not just in front of the camera but behind it as well. The film is drained of almost any colour and contrast giving it a gritty bare bones feel. This is ironic as the film almost has a black and white look to it; it mirrors how Eastwood sees the subject matter. For me though the topic is not as clear-cut and Eastwood if he had lent the film an ounce of thought could have worked wonders on Chris Kyle's biopic. Sadly, he does not.But at least he was thinking during the action scenes because they are terrific and by far the best element in this sub-par film. The tension echoes as if you are taking part in the war and are in Iraq. Kyle experiences extreme, brutal horrors during his time away from his wife played by Sienna Miller, in perhaps one of the most lackluster female roles of late. Miller has little to do and acts little more than the mother to Kyle's children. Without a shred of depth to call her own, we should feel something for her but instead are left out in the cold.Unfortunately, as the film progresses the proceedings go from bad to worse. Which is quite atrocious to say the least. All the right talent is called upon, but I feel that the real person to blame is Eastwood. The man just cannot grasp a feel for the film. Should it be awe-inspiring or violent? Challenging or dumb? 'American Sniper' comes across as the product of two different Directors working against each other and cancelling the other one out. Or was this just Eastwood's own ego working against him? It is in fact the latter. What I mean by this comment is that the brutality of war conflicts with the dull relationship drama provided by Kyle's equally boring wife. The scenes regarding Iraq make for gripping, hard to watch viewing, whereas the scenes with Kyle's wife come across as bland and forced.For anyone who has glanced at a Psychology book prepare to be dumb-founded and amazed during the film's two-hour runtime. Remember how soldiers of war after serving a long term of service returned to their families a complete wreck? How they were terrified and distraught regarding any form of physical violence? Of course you do. This film has not even heard of the term 'psychology' and what it implies. We never get the sense that Chris Kyle has actually changed from the cock-sure guy he once was; unless, you count staring blankly at a television screen to have had a profound effect on him. I for one second do not believe that the real Chris Kyle had no trouble adjusting to normal life after war. Everyone did. The fact that this is swept aside is criminal. Post-traumatic stress disorder should have been at the top of the list for Eastwood but it is ignored in favour of violence, violence and hey guess what? More Violence.This brings me to the absolute worst, disgusting and vile factors that the film gets wrong; firstly, the fact that it has nothing but contempt and soaring love for Chris Kyle. In biopics I wish to be enlightened about everything a person did in their life. But, we are not told about the bad things that the man did! The crew expects us to think of Kyle as a God, I for one object. This is not how you treat any audience member with interest in a true story.But lastly, and this element here makes me question whether Clint Eastwood really cared about his film, because they really do glamourize violence. Not in the way that Quentin Tarantino does, as that is stylized and fictional. In 'American Sniper' we are informed early on that you must treat violence with more violence. This disgusts me. How on earth can I root for a man that sees violence as the only way to solve his problems? I cannot and will not. For some this may not be troublesome, but for me it makes me physically sick. Is this the kind of message that America should be promoting? A definite no from me; this is propaganda at its worst. Clint Eastwood should be ashamed of himself. I am left in complete amazement as to how this film ever got made. I wish it hadn't.In short, 'American Sniper' is a disgusting, biased, propaganda piece on the war of terror on Iraq. Needless to say it has the distinction of being the most disappointing film that I have seen in the cinema in the last five years. American Propaganda would be a more apt title. Clint Eastwood your time as a Director is up, hand in your camera.",4,13,32,2 February 2015
Man of Steel," Snyder's Reboot Sucks out Superman's Soul
","It was indeed a long time ago that I sat down to watch 'Man of Steel' and I remained stunned throughout its runtime. Stunned at how dull, dumb and lifeless the film was! Is this truly Superman's return to form? I strongly doubt it. It was the first Superman film I saw, but now that I have watched the five other instalments I can compare them. The first two films that starred Christopher Reeve in the title role remain classics of the superhero genre that stand almost head to head with Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy. The other two should not even be mentioned in the same paragraph. 'Superman Returns' on the other hand was a loving tribute to the late 70s and early 80s Superman that we all know and love.It is in the great tradition of reboots to try to distance themselves from the last reiteration as much as possible. Apparently that now includes making the film as dull and dreary as can be. Superman is a character who stands for 'truth, justice and the American way'. There is nothing to suggest any of this in 'Man of Steel'. With Zack Snyder showing no love or appreciation for his wide and varied source material. This time around Superman faces off against Zod! Wait didn't that happen with powerful consequences in 'Superman II'? Yes it did. Why Snyder did not choose to tell another villain's mythology is actually beyond anyone's comprehension.Let me start from the beginning. The film opens and it is literally beat for beat the same as the opening for 1978's 'Superman', albeit with a much higher budget and production values. We see Krypton, which is now a twisted darker version of Avatar's Pandora world. Then we are introduced to Jor El played with affection by Russell Crowe, God bless the man, he still tries his best even when the film surrounding him is poor. Oh dear, and Michael Shannon as General Zod hamming it all up; at least he doesn't give a damn. Baby Kal El is then sent to Earth in a thirty minute sequence which is the only glimpse of a heart in the whole film. Thirteen year old Clark Kent does not know who he wants to be and becomes feared and rejected.Kids do not want to be seen with a freak who saves a bus load of children from drowning. He looks to his parents for love. Even Kevin Costner displays emotion as Jonathan Kent. I was actually enjoying the film up until the point where Superman dons the cape. It all goes downhill from there. We are then treated to endless talking, at this point the film feels like it has lasted a lifetime. But hey wake up the action scenes have started! Oh my, they are appalling. They go on forever and consist of Superman beating the living daylights out of Zod. Then throwing him into nearby buildings full of innocent civilians. What does old Superman stand for now eh? Lies, injustice and an American death? Well that's the lasting impression that Snyder gives us.Cavill does a fine job in the role as Superman, but it is nothing like Reeves who effortlessly blended confidence and nerdiness when taking on the dual role and personality traits of Superman and Clark Kent. Hans Zimmer is no John Williams, but still reaches into his inner self to provide the best element of 'Man of Steel', a soaring score. Williams' theme would have been completely misplaced with all the death and destruction taking place in the background. So at least his legacy has not been destroyed, just Superman's.The ending is atrocious and laughable at best. Does Superman have any morale whatsoever? Because Snyder does everything in his power as a director to try and show that he possesses none. In this day and age we have seen a variety of superheroes with relationships; Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy, Tony Stark and Pepper Potts, Bruce Wayne and Rachel Dawes, well briefly at least. I have found memories of Margot Kidder playing Lois Lane. Amy Adams is unfortunately an uninspired casting choice and even looks like she has no wish to be there. I kept on hoping that her character would walk off screen but to no avail. Snyder has not just destroyed my Superman, he has blown to smithereens my Grandfather's as well.Snyder has adopted the 'Batman Begins' approach to Superman. By doing so he has ended up in losing the superhero's appeal, essence and my interest. He has stripped down old Superman to the most boring hero imaginable. The villainous Zod feels like a complete retread, especially when 'Superman II' handled him so superbly. Maybe next time Superman will soar or actually save some innocent civilians, restoring his former glory in the process. For the moment though, Superman flies no more.",5,6,10,10 March 2015
Bridge of Spies," 'Standing Man, Standing Man'
","Steven Spielberg is one of Hollywood's most prolific Directors. He does not have the best track record and yet he creates far more great films than poor ones. It will come as little of a shock then that Bridge of Spies is a great film, with Spielberg on fine form, showcasing tremendous showmanship, craft and talent. Bridge of Spies bears the distinction of being his best film since Saving Private Ryan, so applause in this case is necessary.Based on a true story, Bridge of Spies is set in the fifties in America, during the time of the Cold War. James B Donovan works as a lawyer, but soon the CIA involves him with a suspected Soviet Spy by the name of Rudolf Abel. They ask Donovan to help Abel out in court. What they really mean is to make the proceedings look civilised and yet they all know that Abel does not have a hope in hell. That is until Donovan is willing to truly help him.What Bridge of Spies has really got going for it is an element of intrigue as well as a dash of surprise and suspense. How often is it that we get a film set in the fifties with the amount of drama, wit and excitement that Director Steven Spielberg and writers Joel and Ethan Coen can stir up in us? It's rare for a match between material, writers and director that is quite literally made in heaven. With Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance at the helm, Bridge of Spies is exceedingly well acted and I am not a loyal devotee of Hanks, but here oh my goodness how he shines like never before! His character has heart, warmth and humour. The most important aspects in making us love a character. He is not once misjudged. Thank the marvellous writing from the Coen Brothers for that one!Still considering the talent involved when you have the Coens on board, in all honesty I wanted Bridge of Spies to be a greater film than it actually amounts to. But don't get me wrong this is terrific film making. Yet there's something lacking. What is it? A sense of flowing momentum and precision. Which is all to do with the script. At first glance there's no problem to be had here. Yet upon further scrutiny it does not hold up. My main issue? We are shown scenes that do not need to be seen. They detract from the thrust of the story. We almost forget about Donovan and that's a crime itself. Luckily it's only for ten minutes at a time, but I must admit that these departures from the essence and heart of the story do hurt the film. It's also too long for its own good and I strongly suspect that Spielberg inflated the runtime so that the Academy would pay more attention to the film during awards season. The gamble does not pay off.But let's not get negative here. Bridge of Spies is no question or doubt in my mind an excellent film. Not perfect alas. But brilliant all the same. If anything its further proof that Steven Spielberg is the best at what he does in the business. Particularly if the subject matter is a) A Biopic b) centred around a well-drawn individual and c) about courage in the hardest to find places. Spielberg don't ever stop making movies while I'm around.B+",8,1,3,2 January 2016
Saw III," Saw: The Bloodbath Edition
","It is telling of our culture that 'Saw III' is the highest grossing film of the franchise. It also possesses the largest quantities of blood, until 'Saw: The Final Chapter'. If you are going into Saw III expecting a deep, complex, held back horror, then this is surely not the film for you.Jigsaw's now on death's door. He has the help of his newly appointed apprentice Amanda. She will carry out his remaining traps and ensure that his life's work goes on, even without him. This time he tasks Amanda with kidnapping Lynn Denlon, who works at the local hospital. Lynn's objective is making Jigsaw survive long enough to see the outcome of another victim and his tests set before him. Jigsaw's next victim is Jeff who is filled with vengeance after the death of his beloved son who was hit by a car. The driver left as quickly as possible and Jeff has no room in his heart for pity, kindness or redemption. Jigsaw figures that it is now Jeff's time to be tested. Jeff has three tests, tests of forgiveness for the witness, judge and suspect. Jeff must complete his tests in the allotted time or be trapped in the abandoned factory to die in.'Saw III' contains some of the franchise's most vile traps and the only effective sentimental one. It's an odd mix. But the filmmakers manage to pull it off. People, who have seen the film, will know which traps I am referring to and they occur within the first fifteen minutes. Bring a bucket. The classroom trap needs some description, however brief in order to explain it. The victim in this instance is a convict by the name of Troy. Jigsaw believes him to be 'more comfortable in chains, than you are in freedom'. Troy has chains linked to almost every body part; he will need to rip them out of himself before the bomb detonates. The thing is even if he did make it in time; he would not escape the room alive. The door was sealed shut and the Police had to break it down through force. Detective Kerry who has been on the case since the first killing, decides this is not the work of Jigsaw but an imitator.The same thing happens again. The victim is harnessed into a device that is hooked into her ribcage. She grabs the key out of a vat of acid. It does not matter. The device will not budge. This is the work of perhaps the very same imitator earlier.These traps are not effective. Well in a sense they are, you are sure to feel nauseous. But they are devised for shock value. They do not have half of the weight found in the original because they involve gallons of blood. The only factor that makes them worthwhile is Jigsaw's instructions to the victims. His rasping voice is absorbing to listen to. If only the same could be said of the traps.There is one though that resonates throughout the series. In one of Jeff's tests, the judge is in a huge metal container, lying on his back. It is slowly filling up with the guts of pigs. The only way Jeff can retrieve the key is by burning his son's toys. The look of pain on Jeff's face is palpable and highlights that you do not need to have a barrel full of blood to make an impact on the audience.The acting here is shockingly the best of the series. Angus Macfayden as Jeff is the right amount of disturbing, never under or overplaying to his horrifying predicament. Shawnee Smith as Amanda undoes her excruciating performance from 'Saw II' and for sure is better served in her scenes with the deranged Jigsaw. Tobin Bell brings his character to life and offers the only humanity that can be garnered from someone this psychotic.'Saw III' oversteps the mark frequently. The gore is often far too much to handle and the first couple of traps derivative at best. But once Jeff's game begins, the film hits its bloody stride and delivers fans with a hard-core horror with well-defined characters (for the main cast), who would have thought it? As well as a surprisingly thoughtful story and great acting (for a horror film at least.) If only more Horror sequels were this entertaining, in a sadistic way.",6,0,2,19 April 2015
Quantum of Solace," Bond Goes Bourne
","Whoever gave Marc Forster the gig for Quantum of Solace deserves to be shot. This is not a Bond film, it's not even a competent action picture at that. Quantum of Solace sees Bond go up against Dominic Greene. This evil, dastardly, mean, treacherous man wants to control the water supply of Bolivia!Well he can't be that bad can he? No he is not. He is certainly below Bond though and is pathetically puny. 007 barely pushes himself against Greene because he is just a slippery little snake and hardly worth his time. So there is no decent villain for Bond. So what does Quantum of Solace offer; well let me sum it up as quickly as possible, only fitting seeing as the film is the shortest James Bond picture to date and its questionable at best if any thought at all was given to the film.James Bond does not even bed the Bond girl by the name of Camille. Has Bond lost his touch? Look I know as well as anyone what the idea was behind this choice. To highlight how fragile and broken Bond has become since the cold killing machine he was in Casino Royale. Hey kids, this is what we refer to as symbolism! Blatant, obvious and insulting symbolism. He is heartbroken by the death of Vesper. But this is not what I want to see in a Bond film, it is dreary and sucks all the fun out of the film. In an obvious move to make the Bond franchise more like the Jason Bourne films, the action is edited completely differently. Well that's good. No it is not. Instead of utilizing wide shots like Paul Greengrass did in The Bourne Ultimatum. Marc Forster sticks with close ups for the non-stop hurl inducing action for Quantum of Solace. We have no bearing on what is happening and what is taking place. Well why should I care anymore? Bond has become Jason Bourne. He no longer beds the leading lady and cannot even bring himself to shoot down Dominic Greene. The editing of the action scenes is also so choppy it is incomprehensible, just like the plot of the film.Quantum of Solace forgoes the tradition of James Bond. It is devoid of a worthy villain, a sexy promiscuous woman, entertaining action, gadgets, wit, humour, levity, fun, heart and a soul. I think that is it. Marc Forster leave the Bond franchise and take with you your artistic pretensions and two dimensional characters. In James Bond the villain is supposed to be an evil megalomaniac, not the Director!",4,2,4,30 October 2015
Batman Begins," Why Do We Fall?
","This is one of many memorable quotes from 'Batman Begins', yet it also serves as a message to the Batman film series as a whole. What started promising in the late 80s and early 90s soon became cartoon crap, with no characters to care for. Does anyone want to remember 'Batman and Robin'? No? I thought not. But alas I do not wish to remind you further so moving onMaybe I should thank that film, as after eight years it provided a perfect reason to reboot the series and start afresh. A film which promises the origin story of Batman, Tim Burton never gave us this, only a fleeting look at Bruce Wayne's parent's death. But boy, rest assured this film delivers on so many levels and is definitely worth the extra long wait.The film starts with Bruce Wayne locked up in a prison, the reason for this being that he fights criminals head on. Here he meets Henri Ducard (a spectacular performance by Liam Neeson) who introduces him to Ra's Al Ghul the leader of the league of shadows. Bruce Wayne is trained in the art of their ways, but refusing to kill comes into conflict with them. Here he returns to Gotham and eventually becomes the masked vigilante known as Batman. It is up to him to defeat the Scarecrow and rid Gotham of the corruption that has spread – from judges to cops.One of the most important aspects of Begins is that it takes it's time to get us to understand each character's motives and morals. This is a Batman film in which we actually care about Bruce Wayne. Christian Bale does a perfect job in mastering the two personas of his character, without making him cheesy. There are a handful of fine performances so Gary Oldman's Jim Gordon cannot be missed out as well as Michael Caine's Alfred.The musical score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard is powerful, dramatic stuff and never comes across as over the top or annoying. Zimmer has the bombastic beats for Batman, whereas Howard puts emphasis on the drama and Bruce Wayne's love for Rachael Dawes (Katie Holmes).This film truly is a miracle with Christopher Nolan doing a top notch job of directing and of giving us a quality Batman film that never loses its pace. Every scene is meaningful and there is not a bore in sight. This is also the first Batman to feature the Scarecrow and he sure is scary on screen, by saving the joker for the next one, Nolan does not fall into the trap which Burton did in 1989 and thankfully Batman is not overshadowed by the villain. Most importantly though all the set pieces are a joy to watch and this much cannot be said for half of Hollywood's franchises. A blockbuster film usually compromises action over drama or vice versa e.g. 'Hulk' being the latter. But we always feel the emotions of Wayne and never forget that there is a human inside the suit after all. Nolan gets it right and his daring and the cast and crews pays off.Verdict: This is a perfect start to Batman, showing daring and confidence. This should be the template for any comic book or action film. Nothing is out of place and the visuals provided by Wally Pfister are astounding, showing a haunted Batman. Never has any movie as big as this been thrilling, exciting and tear jerking all at the same time. Everyone on board deserves a pat on the back and a place in movie making history for reviving a fledging franchise and putting Batman back on top. Why do we fall? So that we can learn to pick ourselves up.",9,0,1,11 October 2013
Wreck-It Ralph," OK, but over hyped by critics
","Wreck-it Ralph has a familiar feel, similar in tone to the Toy Story films, as in this instead of the toys having their own personalities the video game characters do. It tells the story of Ralph who is tired of being bad. Day in and day out he wrecks Fix-it Felix's house which Felix has to (guess what) fix! Following this he tries to get himself a medal and recognition for once. The trouble is only heroes get medals and Ralph is considered the villain from the game that he is from. This leads to Ralph to try and get a medal from someone else's video game.The concept is brilliant. The possibilities seem endless. However, the way it goes about it isn't. You can't help feeling that they could have used popular video games as a basis for the movie. Yet we only get fleeting appearances of characters like Sonic. No main roles are given for characters such as these only cameos.To be fair the first half hour of the film is breath taking. So much so that I was under the impression (for half an hour) that this would be a flawless film as lush visuals fill the screen and immerse you in the world Disney has created. Ralph enters a first person shooter which is a strange form for the story to take yet it works incredibly well. It is a different move for Disney altogether.After this sequence (that is highly reminiscent of the Alien franchise) things take a turn for the worse as Disney takes a back to basics approach that is highly formulaic and only kids will love the next hour. He enters a racing video game that feels girlish and has a pink tinge to its surroundings. Too much of this has a, been there done that feel and makes the film less enjoyable to watch. For the majority of the film being set here it is a let-down and you can't help feeling numerous locations would have helped rather than being stranded in this world for nearly an hour.Some elements are good though. The character of Ralph is highly likable and one that you can feel for. (Fix-it Felix is quite poor in comparison). His emotions are understandable and it makes it easier to relate to how he is feeling. There are also never ending references to popular video game characters, which make it impossible to view all by watching it once.One final point, the 3D is excellent. The animation pops out at you from the start and engulfs you in a rainbow of colour. The animators have worked there magic here and can be praised as doing a fine job throughout the entire film. It helps that Disney have decided on an unlimited colour palette which feels reminiscent of Pixar. Just don't expect as much depth as it in terms of story and excitement.Verdict: Although still a good film, Wreck-it Ralph is noticeably not as polished as Pixar's offerings. It does not enter the same league as the Toy Story films or even some of Disney's previous like Aladdin and Hercules. Don't be fooled by critics rave reviews, Wreck-it Ralph is not a masterpiece nor is it a bad film it just ranks somewhere in between. There are lush visuals aplenty here, just lack of an entertaining glued to the seat story. If considering watching go to the cinema with fairly low expectations and you may be pleasantly surprised. If you don't you may feel let down by the high standards of Disney's previous outings.6 Out of 10",6,3,7,18 February 2013
Foxcatcher," Fuelled by Terrific Performances Foxcatcher is a Captivating Biopic
","Olympic wrestling would not usually be my top choice for a biopic. So it surprises me to say that Foxcatcher is one of the best and most compelling films that I have seen in a long time.The true story upon which this film is based is the Olympic Wrestling Team – Foxcatcher. Mark Schultz is trained and brought to John Du Pont's grounds to compete in the 1988 Wrestling Olympics in Seoul, where he trains with a group and his brother Dave.Earlier this year I saw the film 'The Theory of Everything'. I stated that Eddie Redmayne who played Stephen Hawking deserves to win an Oscar. After seeing 'Foxcatcher' it is my duty to retract that statement, as each of the three male actors work above and beyond to the best of their ability. Steve Carell, Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo give career defining performances that are guaranteed to be remembered on their filmography.Although Ruffalo is great, I feel that it is his performance that I gained the least out of as he is given much less screen time than the others and therefore less to do. That being said his performance here is on par with his best work – 'Zodiac'. Carell and Tatum are at the core of this film's success and contribute to perhaps why I love this film as much as I do. Their relationship is intriguing and as the film nears its last third the collective strain on it is tangible.Carell was what I most feared; I felt before I saw this film that he is more suited to comedic roles and would not be able to accurately portray the innate creepiness of John Du Pont. Rest assured that he is absolutely astonishing, most of the time I forgot I was watching a film, at some points I felt like I was watching a documentary.Now, Tatum he deserves an Oscar, in this film he keeps himself extremely restrained. You can tell from his face his thoughts and feelings; you can literally read his mind. He usually portrays characters that are well versed in the world of sports and yes he is in this film as well. But my, he is so subtle, to deny this man an Oscar would be to deny the sheer driving power of the film itself.Many people it seems have taken issue with the films pacing. In all honesty, if Stanley Kubrick was still alive he could have directed it. Read into that what you will. However, this film relies on a bleak tone and I feel that the pacing compliments the film perfectly. If it was too fast then we would never get into the mind-set of the characters – thankfully we do! If you pay any attention to cinematography you will find so much for your eyes to feast upon. Almost every image is imprinted on my mind – the truth is this movie won't leave me alone and I mean that in a positive way! It is your duty to watch 'Foxcatcher' – it has three of the best performances I have seen from a film released in 2014. An enticing script, mind bogglingly great cinematography, an unbelievable third act and heart thumping music. Put into simple terms – deny yourself this film and you are denying yourself one of the best Biopics ever put to celluloid.",10,6,12,10 January 2015
It Follows," The Defining Horror of the Twenty First Century
","In the past decade horror has become a breeding ground for cheap, lousy and poor filmmaking. It mostly comes down to sequels, prequels, remakes, rip-offs and reboots. We have been treated to vile, repulsive and downright disgusting franchises that should have been buried in the dirt a long time ago. Tedious franchises like 'Paranormal Activity' and the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' sequels. They refuse to die. Because who cares about bad reviews when the box office receipts speak volumes.Alas, I am beginning to speak off topic so let me attract your attention to the latest Horror masterpiece that is, 'It Follows'. The premise itself is surprisingly original and frightening of its own accord. The lead woman, Jay is a vulnerable nineteen year old and most importantly an independent character which is refreshing for a horror film. She is like any other girl that is nearing womanhood who just wants to chill out with her friends, be popular and go out on dates with guys.Jay meets up with the new guy in town, Hugh. He strikes her as a confident and caring person. They go out on several dates, but when they go out to the cinema things start to go a bit odd. Hugh tells Jay that someone is watching them, but only Hugh appears to be able to see this person. They promptly leave the cinema and proceed to make love in a car. How romantic! Jay loses focus and realises until it is too late that Hugh is about to knock her out. She wakes up; strapped to a chair by her hands and feet. Hugh points something out that is far off moving slowly towards them. Hugh then tells Jay that he has transmitted a virus onto her. This virus makes a human like being stalk you everywhere you go, until it finds and kills you. The only way to avoid this horrid fate is to pass it onto another host through sex. After this information Jay is understandably traumatised. She confesses to her close friends, yet believes that if she tells her parents they will think that she needs medical treatment.What makes the villain so effective and disturbing is its simplicity with which it dispatches its many victims. We never see the true form of the follower and this approach makes it even scarier. It takes human form and can replicate the look of your best friend. Unless you have one that is constantly drooling and walking slowly I would not panic. Well this is what I thought at first and felt that Jay was in no immediate danger; as the follower stalks its victims with the same immediacy as the zombies in 'Shaun of the Dead', very slowly then. However, it never stops, never shows any mercy and never appears to have any real meaningful motive to speak of. You would believe that the villain at first glance is underdeveloped and weak, that may be the case, but for Horrors it is a godsend. We never properly see it, so what terrifies us the most is left to our imagination and instinct of fear. The fact that it never has a reason for what it does means that you cannot change its mind. It just wishes to kill you. There are several set pieces each one topping the last in terms of creativity and how they all differentiate themselves from the other. The locations may seem bland, but the everyday can make us shiver none the less, because they are places that we can identify with. We feel complacent and relaxed, what 'It Follows' makes us do, is become paralysed by fear when revisiting well known locations like, our home, school, the beach, the cinema and the local swimming pool.I used to think that horrors where limited in terms of the time of day. But this one proves that daylight can in fact be more fear inducing than utter darkness. You can see everyone and everything, but the follower could be the person standing next to you or off in the far distance. Jay begins to realise that she will never be able to keep her guard down for too long if she wishes to survive. The time flies by and when the lights came on, I was as shocked as anyone in the cinema, that this masterwork of fear, art and terror was over. I wish it would never end!Many other factors of 'It Follows' continue to stalk my mind and dreams. The music sounds like it was taken from the seventies and ties in with themes of danger and loss of innocence. The cinematography is low key yet still manages to look as glorious as a paint stroke from Mr Turner. Every shot is calculated and excellent. Expect the Director David Robert Mitchell to become as widely congratulated as Stanley Kubrick and Alfred Hitchcock the acclaimed masters of suspense and horror. I honestly cannot praise this film highly enough! Even the female lead that is fairly unknown, the wickedly talented Maika Monroe shows a surprising amount of skill in front of the camera. This is sure to be the film that catapults her towards stardom and fame. Monroe is ever so convincing as the petrified Jay who finds it harder to lead a normal life. Made all the worse by the follower and the fact that only its victims can see it. She outdoes herself and as an actress is sure to lead a long astonishing set of performances in her wake.'It Follows' is not only the greatest horror to grace our screens in 2014. It is also the best since the original 'Alien'; suspenseful, wicked, cruel, nail biting and harsh. The film always connects us through an immense leading role from Maika Monroe. Expect David Robert Mitchell to become the next horror perfectionist.",10,91,189,8 March 2015
Legend," Even Two Tom Hardy's cannot Save Legend's Lacklustre Script
","There's a compelling film lurking beneath the surface of 'Legend'. Brief glimpses highlight something greater that sadly never came to fruition.'Legend' is a biopic centered on the infamous Kray twins in London during the sixties; it chronicles their rise to power and eventual downfall.I can see why people would shout their praise for 'Legend', but only if they were completely blind to its numerous flaws. Although I find the film far from gripping it does succeed on a couple of fronts. Tom Hardy offers up an excellent performance as Reggie Kray. You can almost feel the rage building up inside him as the more thoughtful and less brash of the twins. The set design is an important part of the film as it helps you feel like you are watching the narrative unfold during the sixties.One troublesome aspect of 'Legend' is Tom Hardy's other performance as the demented Ronnie Kray, whom at the start of the film is in a mental home. At times Hardy nails the feel of the character acting subdued and lost in his surroundings. Then the other part of his performance kicks in and you become thrown off balance because of how drastically it has changed and for the worst. Ronnie Kray becomes little more than a cartoon character, out of place in the world that Director Brian Helgeland has constructed. Numerous times we are told that Ronnie is a homosexual. Yet, the script is unsure whether this is a laughing matter or not. After all admitting to being a homosexual was considered a severe crime in the sixties. That's where the tone of the film falters; are we supposed to take everything as a joke or at face value? As the character of Frances (Reggie's Girlfriend) would point us towards the latter option.A voice-over should only be used sparingly and if it actually offers us insight into the character's mind. If used all the time it becomes an irritation and takes the audience out of the moment. France's voice- over makes little sense within the context of the film. She offers explanations to events that she was not present at, so how could she know? Frances interrupts the narrative flow of the film on numerous occasions. So much so that the film does not let you figure out anything on your own and the whole affair plays out more like a book than a film. Did the Director forget that film is a visual medium? But, why can't he even trust his audience? It feels insulting and I do not want every single detail spelled out for myself.'Legend' had potential. So what happened? If a polished script was in use then I could see 'Legend' being remembered in years to come. But when your competition is 'The Godfather' and 'Goodfellas' you have to up your game. Two Tom Hardy's really is not enough if your script is weak and underdeveloped. If a talented Director was given this material then they could at least have made it memorable; instead of becoming the sorely squandered potential that 'Legend' truly is.",5,1,3,4 October 2015
The Theory of Everything," The Theory of Filmmaking
","Sigh, another biopic of an extremely brilliant man. Is there any point? Can we understand the scientific genius Stephen Hawking? Actually, as it turns out we can. Going into this film I was excited but somewhat sceptical. Biopics can be eye-opening; however we must be firmly grounded with the character at its core. If we lose focus, then a film may as well stop as far as I am concerned. What 'The Theory of Everything' chiefly gets right is that we are always engaged and care about the life of Stephen Hawking, which is no small task, especially when one considers how brainy the man is.We enter the swinging sixties where a healthy Hawking studies Cosmology at Cambridge; he shares a room with Brian played by Harry Lloyd who has a perfect relationship with him, one that works off of the thoughts and excellence of the other. Eddie Redmayne plays the eccentric Hawking and gives a performance which will (and must) win him an Oscar. When you view the film you will find it hard to disagree. He is truly a breakthrough and does the man justice – yes he looks the part, but do not fear this man can act.He meets the determined Jane played by Felicity Jones who manages to be one of the better female roles captured on film. Many may remember the cringe worthy performance supplied by the pretty but not reliable Keira Knightley in 'The Imitation Game', which is another biopic worthy of mention. Jones outshines her effortlessly and seems secure in the role. As Hawking's physical well-being deteriorates she remains strong and powerful in a role many may have swept to the side. That is harder to do, when you see what she manages to achieve. When we learn that his life will never be the same again, the film veers dangerously off course, prompting tears but not much of anything worthy of substance. Don't worry this is a small bump in an otherwise smooth journey.As Hawking loses control of his muscles we are presented with an astonishing scene – one that will resonate throughout film history. As he prepares to leave the table from dinner he finds it difficult to walk up the stairs. As his legs give way he is forced to use his arms as his sole means of reaching his destination. As he looks up he sees his child whom is crawling on all fours without effort. This is a poignant parallel where Hawking sees what he has become, a small infant like child, one who is now dependent on others for his well-being.Over two hours in length, the film's grip lets go in the last third. Consider this necessary as up to this point it has been breath-taking. The film after all had to give us room to breathe. 'The Theory of Everything' is a biopic that gets almost (well) everything right. The two leads are strong, the love story is believable. But, most importantly we always understand and never lose sight of Stephen Hawking. 'The Theory of Everything' passes with honours.",8,2,4,6 January 2015
22 Jump Street," Lord and Miller Strike Comedy Gold
","What a pleasant surprise this is and a joy! 21 Jump Street was also an unexpected treat, because truth be told it did not look as though it had enough comedic potential for a feature length film. The director duo, Phil Lord and Chris Miller, have proved themselves worthy of comedies for the younger generation with The Lego Movie which was released this year as well. Yet for the adolescents their footing comes much more naturally.22 Jump Street takes place after the events of 21; Jenko and Schmidt have successfully brought down the destruction of the drug HFS at a high school. They saved the damsel in distress (Brie Larson) who added warmth and fire to the film. Then proceeded to stop Mr Walters and Eric from getting out of the drug charges; they now share a cell together – much to Eric's annoyance. This provides an exceptional end credits scene, so be sure not to leave until the curtains are closed.In 22, Jenko and Schmidt are enrolled into college by Captain Dickson, played with laugh-a-second gags by Ice Cube. They yet again have to stop a drug known as the street name WHYPHS (the unabbreviated version is hilarious), which when spoken sounds similar to Wi-Fi. So in terms of the plot and structure there is little difference to this film and its predecessor. It has the same bromance theme – helped tremendously by Schmidt and Jenko's chemistry and likability; which shine here. There are car chases and numerous action scenes; this is more of a buddy-cop film than the first, but I'm not complaining. We also get another romance between Schmidt and Maya (Amber Stevens). This sadly, feels out of place and taped in at the last minute, only to serve as conflict towards Schmidt and Jenko's appreciation for each other. It begs comparison between Molly and Schmidt in the previous film and the romance here feels forced and under-developed.What it comes down to is that this is more of the same – if you liked the first, you'll enjoy this more and if you didn't then you will dislike it. But, you probably already know if this film is for you, however if you are unsure I implore you to watch it. Overall, the film is funnier, alas this sometimes comes at the expense of the film's heart – something had to give. The jokes come thick and fast, at several points I had to hold on to my belly in fear that I might just die from laughing. Ice Cube gets a supporting role this time, rather than the almost cameo appearance he had in 21. This is definitely the film's strongest point and it utilises it to the max. He gets the broadest laughs and I can only hope he has even more screen time in the inevitable 23 Jump Street.Yet, one of the greatest elements about this film is how knowing and self-aware it all is. It is as if the directors are winking at the audience, and this does not come across as cheesy, which it could easily have done if not handled with care. There are nods at other franchises, gags about clichés ('the girl always gets kidnapped') which are turned on its head. Jokes about how this will not be as good or as fun as last time. Yet, for all the times that the film says it won't be as awesome as the last, this is not the case and I am all the more happy for it.If you thought that Lord and Miller might have lost their touch after delving into kiddie fare, then rest assured this instalment is as great as if not funnier and better than the last. This is one of the best comedies in years, I am sure it will stand the test of time like Shaun of the Dead will. It has the potential to be as outrageously hilarious as Pegg and Frost's Cornetto trilogy. This outing proves that the director duo is more than up to the challenge.",8,1,7,30 June 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Spidey Swings into Action
","Spider-Man's film franchise has always been a bumpy road with Sony Pictures. The Sam Raimi trilogy for the most part revitalised the Superhero genre that was stuck in the mud with the abysmal Batman and Robin. The first Spidey outing changed the genre around and managed to get fans interested in the characters and the storyline once again. The sequel improved with a more complex villain and better character development. However, fans lost faith with the threequel and Spidey's future was stuck to one huge tangle of a web.Then along came Marc Webb, with The Amazing Spider-Man which was shrugged off by the critics and called a cash grab. However, whatever criticisms there have been of the previous four films this one seems devoid of all of them and gives fans what they have longed for; an exciting, mesmerising and pulse- pounding adventure one that stays true to the comics.The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a jam packed film and every shot has been thoroughly examined and expertly directed by Marc Webb. The effects are the best that they have ever looked, the characters are fully developed and we care more than we ever have done about them all and the action and story threads are not all over the place. The beauty of TASM 2 lies in the fact that the origins of Spidey have been set up and he is free to roam this spectacularly created world.It is fair to say that there has not been much hype surrounding this superhero sequel and going in with high but not extreme expectations it blew them out of the park so effortlessly I was left gob-smacked. This leaves us with undoubtedly a Superhero for the ages and the best outing for any standalone character since The Dark Knight Rises.The score composed by Hans Zimmer shows off his mastery of the Superhero genre of music and his themes for Spidey, Electro and Goblin are always enthralling and only add to the burst of colour and energy that we receive on screen. Here's to hoping he can stay on as he proves himself a worthy heir to Danny Elfman's Spidey scores.Furthermore, the story threads are balanced with ease and that is not a small task to be had. There are three villains; Electro, the Green Goblin and the Rhino. The rhino played with a maniac twist by Paul Giamatti relishes the short screen time he gets and leaves us longing for more (which will come with TASM 3). The goblin (Dane DeHaan) gives a better performance than the campy version we got with Willem Dafoe in 2002. He brings menace and I was shaken up when we hear his manic cackle from afar off screen. His relationship with Peter is explored and his origin story is told well and most importantly of all his character motivations makes sense. Electro (Jamie Foxx) gives a career changing performance and matches if not exceeding Doc Ock in 2004. He is similar to this character as he is more of a tragic villain, striving to be noticed and changing by a terrible accident into the deformed and terrifying Electro. He changes so drastically throughout the film's runtime it leaves us with a Spidey villain for the ages.Gwen and Peter's relationship is given plenty of depth and is not (thankfully) lost in the plethora of set pieces and action scenes that frequently take place. The struggle of Peter's double life gives us many twists and turns. Andrew Garfield (who is by far the greatest Spidey and Peter Parker) and Emma Stone light up the screen with their meaningful and charismatic chemistry ensuring that sometimes two people talking can be just as exciting as watching the action unfold.The final end scene is heartfelt, surely bringing a tear to even the most cold-hearted of people and will definitely leave viewers overwhelmed by the direction this sequel takes, yet it is never clichÃ©d, boring or predictable.This is a smart film and should be the template for Superhero sequels to follow in many years to come; it is a game changer one that breaks the mould and sets the bar as high as Spidey's web can reach. Webb will need to be on top form to exceed this rare thing; a Superhero Masterpiece.",4,148,320,22 April 2014
Ex Machina," A Thoughtful, Well-Acted, Multi-Layered Sci-fi
","Does artificial intelligence have a consciousness? This is the question that 'Ex Machina' probes us throughout and does so with immediacy and great effect. The film is essentially a parable on technology and its evolution, which acts as a warning for the human race not to become too dependent on machines.'Ex Machina' does not waste time, as soon as the logos have evapourated we fleetingly see the face of Caleb played by Domhnall Gleeson with curiosity and a will above all else for the truth. He wins a competition and is whisked away to Nathan's private facility where he is creating the first ever working Artificial Intelligence System. Caleb is brought there to figure out whether the AI acts and thinks like a human and whether she has passed Nathan's test of having her own consciousness. Oscar Isaac again impresses as the genius computer coder Nathan, even if his role is fairly minor compared to his other more influential body of work. At the remote facility Caleb is introduced to the AI known as Ava. She is played by Alicia Vikander with authority and control. In the films darkest moments she really is sinister and her presence is not as soothing as it once was.I may as well get over with what I disliked about the film, which is a very minor factor indeed. Within the first ten minutes we are introduced to Nathan. I would have liked to have seen how Caleb interacts with his co-workers in his job, which would give us a better comparison between his interaction with humans and the relationship he builds up with Ava. It is not enough to find out that he does not have a girlfriend. I realised I was in need of something more and this interaction would have provided me with it. But I have a tendency to nit-pick and this did not detract from my overall experience in the slightest.The film itself feels withdrawn and held back but in a good way. As the three main characters are impressive and none of them let down the production at all, the casting choices must be commended. I could not help but feel that the Director and Writer, Alex Garland has been heavily influenced by the likes of David Fincher. The film has a very precise and pinpoint accuracy to it. None of the choices made, feel like they were easy ones or done without thought. Every element feels calculated and for a film like 'Ex Machina' it benefits and compliments the tone perfectly. The film is many things; thought provoking, fast paced and completely compelling. I still cannot stop but think about this film and its intricacies, it has been almost a week. It sticks embedded into my brain and lingers there around my thoughts. I wonder is it long before we actually develop an AI? The thought still terrifies me.'Ex Machina' never comes to a halt for too long. It trusts its audience and will not give them the easy way out. This means that every fifteen minutes it mixes things up. This ensures that it is always compelling. The relationship dynamic between Ava and Caleb is intriguing. One has never been outside the walls of her room, the other is in need of companionship. What makes it have a driving force is that they both rely on each other for their certain needs. The computer generated images blend seamlessly within the film and never draw too much attention to themselves apart from the fact that they look gorgeous and are guaranteed to dazzle the eye of even the most cynical film goer. Technology really has come a long way this past decade, but perhaps this film will encourage people to not get too carried away.Even the music brings back fond memories of Trent Reznor and Attitcus Ross' scores for 'The Social Network' and 'Gone Girl' both of which are David Fincher films. The two collaborators for 'Ex Machina' racket up the tension to unprecedented levels. The sound is very electronic and machine like. It questions the audience as to whether Nathan can be trusted and also is Ava as vulnerable as she has led Caleb to believe. The film's cinematography looks cold but has an elegance to it. It is strange to see a film so visually stunning from Alex Garland who is a first time film maker.The story is made all the more cohesive by the way it is structured. As with every scene with Ava and Caleb, text appears, reminding the audience what session number it is. It keeps the film easier to follow and means that we are never too puzzled or lost.With 'Ex Machina' Alex Garland proves himself to be a worthy Director and Writer. He is in my mind about to become the greatest film maker since David Fincher, if he can keep up this high quality of work. For a first feature Garland accomplishes many things that long term Directors still to this day fail to do. Dazzling camera work, compelling story-telling and above all a focus for characters and what makes them tick. For Garland this signals a calling card of the highest order and cements this work as one of the best first features for a very long time indeed. One thing is for sure Scorsese, Tarantino and Nolan, watch your backs. Cinema is about to change forever.",9,5,20,10 February 2015
Big Hero 6," Disney's Latest is possibly its Greatest
","It has been a good year for animated flicks. Lego had a crack at it, a dragon breathed fire once more and now Disney is back to put the competition to shame. There was once a time when PIXAR overshadowed Disney, now that process has been reversed with the likes of quality films from 'Tangled' to 'Frozen' and now 'Big Hero 6'.In a world where superhero films have become its own genre, the market recently has been flooded – with well too much of everything. Have these marketing executives over at Marvel ever heard that less is more? I doubt it. Although 'Big Hero 6' is a Disney film, it was actually adapted from a Marvel comic. The real question is that do these two existing franchises work well together? You can bet everything that you own they do! All the key hallmarks of Disney are there – minus the music numbers, with added wise cracks and wit surely helped by being brothers with Marvel.Our hero is a 14 year old boy called Hiro Hamada resident of fictional city San Fransokyo who teams up with his friends and lovable, caring and unintentionally funny robot Baymax. Their bond is one of loyalty, friendship and full of heart. No bond has been stronger since that of Andy and Woody in 'Toy Story'. The six heroes – hence the title – realise their city is in danger and must become their own brand of funky superheroes in order to fight this mysterious new force.'Big Hero 6', like most Disney films is daring, be prepared to be put through the emotions frequently. This film will undoubtedly draw comparisons to other superhero ensembles that we have been treated to like –'The Incredibles', 'The Avengers' and 'X-Men: Days of Future Past'. Consider this the icing on the cake.Of course the film has visual flair, so much so that I initially thought PIXAR were the ones responsible. The voice acting without question is stellar and the characters therefore feel fully formed, had I not known it was animated I would have sworn that the characters and their relationships with others are real.'Big Hero 6', really hit hard for me how animation is rivalling that of live-action. Many superhero films were released this year, four, yes four others! But this one stood out and had me crying like a little baby. Consider that a compliment, I don't think that live-action films even had half as much feeling as this film – ironic considering that the characters are computer animated! Many of the sceptical among us will shout and cry no musical numbers from the rooftops! Does this mean that the score from Henry Jackman is worthless? No! It is energetic and vibrant providing some of the best superhero themes ever produced! Just wait until you hear the new Fallout Boy song; 'Immortals', it works seamlessly into the film. If this is what it cost to not have musical numbers them I'm all the more happy for it.How could I call this anything less than spectacular? I can't! Anyone in need of a great animated film step right up! It never panders to the kids, always thrills and most importantly understands key human emotion, particularly loss and how to deal with it. I've honestly never felt so happy that animation exists within cinema since 'Beauty and the Beast'! Anyone in question of my belief should see it for themselves; this is truly an opportunity you cannot afford to miss!",7,52,79,5 January 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy," Marvel's Big Gamble
","It is important to note that this could have been the be all and end all for the Marvel Cinematic Universe; if Guardians of the Galaxy flopped, then Marvel's prospects for the future would not look too bright to say the least. What was considered a huge gamble on Marvel's part actually pays off. 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is a bold and brave new step in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and an unexpected delight of 2014. This is extremely surprising given that this is the first Marvel film to take part almost entirely in another galaxy, feature a talking animal and protagonists that do not possess super powers; they are all mercenaries, bounty hunters and rogues.The characters are new to us (unless you are familiar with the source material); all of the protagonists are fun characters to watch on screen and it is refreshing to see a new batch of superheroes fight forces of evil rather than the usual members of The Avengers. There is Peter Quill, a mercenary played by Chris Pratt, he is able to infuse energy to the film that makes him stand out whenever he is on screen. Gamora (Zoe Saldana) who oozes charm and sexiness, Drax (Dave Bautista) a character that takes every comment a bit too literally, Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) a walking, talking tree is limited to a three word vocabulary and Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper). Rocket could have easily been the character that drags the film down, but this is not at all the truth here. Cooper gives him wit and some of the biggest laughs in the film are attributable to him.It is a shame then when the villain turns up and has to spoil some of the fun. Ronan (Lee Pace) poses little of a threat for the team of misfits and his depth as a character is limited to 'I am the bad guy, I do evil things'. Maybe it is because I am spoilt by Loki that I crave a villain that is as witty, smart and deadly as him. To be fair to Pace he does have a physical presence, the director; James Gunn just does not know what to do with him. He is on the side-lines; his screen time is diminished in favour of beefing up the roles for the protagonists.The central plot revolves around the Guardians of the Galaxy and Ronan wanting to claim an object known as the orb for themselves. This would normally be business as usual for people familiar with previous entries in the series like 'The Avengers' and 'Thor: The Dark World'. But, what Guardians does different from those films is it turns them upside down. It acknowledges when it is silly and stupid, ensuring that we are always laughing with it, not at it. It never takes itself too seriously and when you think it will, the scene ends on a completely different note. It is the funniest comic book film thus far and I would go as far to say that it has more laughs than 75% of films claiming to be 'comedies'. The film is made even more enjoyable from the vibrant direction by James Gunn and the sensational cinematography, which will have your jaw dropping repeatedly.Special mention has to go to the music that is used throughout the film. The director manages to get away with using songs from the 70s, this is because Quill has his own mix tape from when he was a child, playing his music throughout the film. 'Hooked on a Feeling' by Blue Swede works with the frenetic, oddball nature of the film and is sure to have you smiling as to the ingenuity and daring of including it.The set pieces are incredible and it puts the ones shown in 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' to shame. A particular fun and clever sequence is a jail break that is attempted by our five heroes. The visuals are stellar and it is a nice showcase for the characters abilities and how they work together as a team. Through sheer luck, they manage to survive and it highlights that these characters never have a plan; they just improvise and rarely seem to know what at all they are doing.'Guardians of the Galaxy' proves that comic book films sometimes can be just witty, hilarious and light hearted fun. It is fair to say this is the best film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since 'The Avengers'. James Gunn does what I would have thought impossible; he creates not only a great comic book film, but an incredible sci-fi film as well. I just can't wait to see where the characters venture to next.",9,3,7,5 August 2014
Saw II," Slick, Sick and Quick
","It seems that a 'Saw' sequel was always on the cards before the release of the original in October of 2004. The original surprised many people, as it was complex, intricate and full of suspense. As well as grossing over $100 Million on a meagre budget of only a million dollars. 'Saw II' ups the ante, not in terms of tension, but blood and gore.Not many months have passed after Jigsaw's test in the last film and this time he has taken a turn for the worse. He is in a warehouse rigged up to a drip. Detective Matthews and Kerry discover the location of Jigsaw's most recent test, that takes place at the start of the film. The person that is involved in the test that Jigsaw addresses through a video tape is what he calls 'an informant, a rat, a snitch. I call you unworthy of the body you possess, of the life that you've been given.' Jigsaw informs him that the device that he is wearing, is hooked up to his neck and when the time expires will encase his head, effectively killing him. 'Think of it like a Venus fly trap' As opposed to the first film, where at least half of the victims survived, this one does not. Eric Matthews investigates the scene and comes to the conclusion that this is once again the work of Jigsaw. Eric's son Daniel is disobedient and in trouble with the police on a regular basis. Matthews' finds Jigsaw's location and realises a terrible truth, his son is currently in a test of his own with several others. The house is filled with toxic gas and only antidotes scattered throughout the house, via completing the traps offer the gift of life. Daniel and the other victims must work together if they are to survive the next two hours. Meanwhile, Matthews' interrogates Jigsaw in the hope of figuring out the location of the toxic gas house, before the time expires.The most apparent element about 'Saw II' is that the characters apart from Eric Matthews and Jigsaw have no character development, a lack of motivation and are atrociously acted. Jigsaw is the best element of 'Saw II' because we are provided with a larger background of his character. We now know that he is a cancer patient, with not long left to live. This partially explains why he does what he does. He wants other people to appreciate what life they have got left to live. Still, I'm sure there is a more effective way than putting people in traps. He must have spent his entire pension on the mechanical devices themselves. Don't ask. Now he is able to perform surgical operations on his victims. We as an audience are not supposed to think too deeply, it is after all a horror sequel.The main attraction to the gore thirsty faithful is the variety of deadly traps and how they play out. Apart from the aforementioned Venus Fly Trap and the needle pit, there is little ingenuity and invention on display here. Even if some of the other traps do display an amount of this, it is cancelled out by how stupid the characters are. Jigsaw gives his victims instructions and they fail to carry them out, yet the answer is right in front of their face!The films length is just over 84 minutes which helps 'Saw II' substantially. It never becomes too dull and a short runtime means that it is not painful to watch. At least for people who like gore and nice little twists at the end to keep them occupied.'Saw II' is nowhere near the terror of the nightmare inducing original, regarding clever plot nuances and depth of character. It provides fans with higher levels of blood and gore, but a lack of tension almost undoes its impact completely. For fans of blood filled horrors though, what is on offer here may be more than satisfactory.",6,1,3,19 April 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Whedon Unleashes Our Inner Nerd
","We all knew Joss Whedon faced an impossible task with 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'. To not only craft a sequel that was as great as 'The Avengers', but one which beats the competition without question. Needless to say, Whedon succeeds marvellously. You know you are in for a film of magnificence, when the opening prologue bests its predecessor in every conceivable way.The Avengers are a powerful team. Yet they will inevitably meet their doom, one day or another. Tony Stark knows this better than anyone. He confides in Bruce Banner (AKA the Hulk), that the Avengers need an end game, a way out from their super heroic deeds. Together they create the thing that they dread 'Ultronin the flesh'. Ultron is an artificial intelligence system, who is created with the sole intention of making the world safe; this is because the Avengers cannot protect the world forever. Once Ultron questions his creator and rebels against him, he believes that a better world is one which The Avengers do not inhabit. Ultron teams up with brother and sister duo; Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch to destroy the team, once and for all.The cast for 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is impeccable, with old friends and new foes alike. The heroes are Iron Man (a witty Robert Downey Jr.), the Hulk (the subtle Mark Ruffalo), Thor (a god-like Chris Hemsworth) and Captain America (a righteous Chris Evans.) Joining them are assassins Hawkeye (a keen Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (an emotional Scarlett Johansson.) On the opposing side are Scarlet Witch (an illuminating Elizabeth Olsen) and Quicksilver (a supersonic Aaron Taylor-Johnson.) The big baddie with global domination on his mind every waking minute is Ultron. He is voiced by James Spader, who oozes determination, power and intimidation. The key thing of note about Ultron is that he is intelligent and resourceful, not a lumbering henchman with dumb schemes. Ultron has a plan, one which he does not entirely divulge to The Avengers. It's so good to not be bombarded by exposition, which is far too present in the X-Men franchise. Avengers could teach it a thing or two.The action set pieces have been thoroughly thought out; this gave me the impression that the production and animation team left nothing up to chance. The first fifteen minutes feature enough excitement on their own to put Bond out of business for good. We are introduced in this sequence to all the major players and briefly glimpse Ultron's final form. Furthermore, the fight that sees Iron Man don the Hulk Buster Armour in an attempt to stop an out of control Hulk from causing higher levels of chaos is breath taking. I literally lost my mind and I am certain that any other audience member will as well.Joss Whedon excels not just at action, but with the dialogue and characters. Each and every person on screen feels fully formed and defined. This time there is no weak link glaringly present. Hawkeye was underutilised in 'The Avengers', however in 'Age of Ultron' we care more about him. This is because we discover many secrets to his and other character's pasts. The most intriguing of which is the character of Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow) whom sees a glimpse of how she became an assassin and her vulnerability; this gives her feeling, thus in the process making her seem less two dimensional than she arguably was before. The lines are witty and still retain emotion. 'Age of Ultron' has a heart that the majority of comic book films can only aspire to. Tony Stark is extremely funny, able to provide laughs amid the ongoing destruction. Bruce Banner is thoughtful, wondering if the Hulk is the darker side of his personality. Thor says the wrong thing frequently that provokes the enemy and Captain America is the soul of the film, bringing the heroes to fight together against Ultron in the climactic, unbelievable battle, which left me lost for words. I have rarely experienced such a feeling and 'Age of Ultron' had me regularly gasping, cheering and crying. Bless Joss Whedon who brings heart, humour and soul to The Avengers. I am left utterly speechless and cannot imagine regaining this feeling until 'Avengers: Infinity War Part I' which will be released in 2018.As cinematographer Ben Davis can do no wrong. Having previously photographed 'Guardians of the Galaxy', it is clear that with 'Age of Ultron' he is relaxed and in his element. No praise I could give him would be sufficient. The score composed by Danny Elfman and Brian Tyler is what fan boys like me; hear in their heads, when imagining their favourite heroes being brought to life. I'm still humming the theme tune and will be buying the soundtrack upon its release. What pleased me the most about the score was the inclusion of Alan Silvestri's Avengers theme, what a tremendous homage indeed.Mightier than Thor's hammer, funnier than Stark's trademark wit and smarter than Banner's brain; 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is a comic book film that rules above all others.",7,19,42,23 April 2015
Saw," 'I Want To Play A Game'
","In 'SAW' a twisted killer makes up his own games for people whom he believes do not appreciate their lives. The mysterious Adam and strange Doctor Gordon must work together, if they are to escape a test of their own, before their time expires.'SAW' is a franchise that has had its day. The sequels failed to understand what the original did effectively. This was the lack or somewhat lack of gore, as opposed to the sequels that rely on gore for shock value. It instead goes for a mysterious thriller vibe, with an effective villain, you can even understand his reasons for doing what he does. Not that that entitles him to do the acts of violence he commits, just he makes some sense, even if his methods are questionable at best.The first 'SAW' is by far the most original of the bunch and offers scares and creepiness as well as being the only one that is really worth watching. Think of it as 'Se7en' turned up to 11. This is both good and bad. It allows for more gory detail, but has less character nuances. It still provides however, some great thrills without the use of jump scares. Ignore the sequels and stick to the unrelenting original, as they are with a few exceptions, poorly made. In the first instalment there is gore, but not an overwhelming amount. What impresses most is the acting for this genre which is good, when one considers the meagre budget of a million dollars spent on the film. The music is not cheap and is the one thing you cannot fault the film for, whether you love it or hate it. I consider myself in the former camp. Although the film is not flawless, as some of the events are a little far-fetched, at least you can never guess the many twists and turns along the way! The ending will leave you mesmerized.It is a testament to the original and how much I value it as a horror film, that I will re watch it on a regular basis, regardless of whether it is Halloween or not; whilst this is no 'The Thing' or 'The Shining', 'SAW' achieves what it sets out to do, in the best possible way, without an over reliance on bland characters, cheap scares or boring villains. It was never going to be a masterpiece, but 'SAW' can claim to be one of the most effective and original Horrors of the 2000s. The fact that it can still bring in new audiences to this day, speaks volumes about how frightening the first one really is.So settle in for a great little horror, which unfortunately gave birth to a franchise. Maybe it should stay dead, like Jigsaw's many victims. Just pretend the first instalment is the only one in existence, which is how I manage to sleep at night.",8,0,3,6 April 2015
Sicario," A Deliriously Thrilling Ride
","Director Denis Villeneuve is no stranger to dark, gritty and compelling thrillers. His whole filmography to date is almost solely comprised of them. 'Sicario' proves that even if this is well trodden ground, it does not matter when the film itself is this riveting to watch.When FBI Agent Kate Macer is selected as part of a task force to combat the war against drugs in Mexico she will find her ethics and morals challenged. It is all too soon when she must accept the horrors and the line between corruption and justice.What's striking about 'Sicario' is its approach to its subject matter. Not many Hollywood films would open with a tense scene of a horrifying slaughter house. But then Villeneuve has never been one to use clichés from the genre, he would much rather subvert them. From the Director that brought us 'Prisoners' it would be expected for the cast to show their value. Emily Blunt as Macer is in way over her head, she cannot even comprehend the horror of what is going on behind the scenes. She helps convey the intensity of her character and her ongoing search for the truth. Everyone in supporting roles from Josh Brolin to Benicio Del Toro outline their character traits so that they never feel underdeveloped.Roger Deakin's cinematography has to be commented on. From the vastness and washed out colours of Mexico to the bright blue and secure safety of the Border of America just beyond the horizon.The music swells and it made my hands shake with nervousness and my forehead sweat as if a tap had been turned on. Johann Johannsson's score is a masterclass in what well composed music can do for a film and most importantly the impact it can have on a viewer.Although I would love to delve into the inner workings of 'Sicario' like the sick and demented maze that it is. I will not. I just refuse to spoil the twists and my advice is to go in blind. I did and I was thoroughly scared, thrilled and impressed throughout its runtime. It's hard to remember a film where the direction was so outstanding and superb that it made me feel smart for figuring the film out. Yet 'Sicario' is ultimately unpredictable. You could not plot out its beats from start to finish because it has so many twists, that it's impossible to see all of them (if any) coming in advance.'Sicario' is a rewarding experience. Rewarding for the viewer that wants to have their intelligence applauded. It lets you figure out the film on your own without telling all. It succeeds on many fronts, mainly because we anticipate the story, tension and character arcs. In all honesty the ending feels unsatisfactory but the thrills that it generates along the way make it all too easy to push aside any potential flaws that are highlighted along the way. 'Sicario' firmly cements Villeneuve's incredible talent as a Director whom is sure to define this generation of thrillers, the same way that David Fincher defined the last.",9,0,3,21 October 2015
Steve Jobs," Jobs Version 2.0
","It's practically impossible to review Danny Boyle's Steve Jobs without bringing up The Social Network. They are not exactly identical subjects. Yet they bear certain inescapable similarities. Both about an egotistical loner, outside of regular society and so devoted to creating the next big thing that they do not care whom they hurt in the process. Steve Jobs is not the better film of the two and yet it's not far behind either.Steve Jobs is the co-founder of Apple. To say he is demanding of his staff would be a severe understatement. He expects everything from them and if they fail to live up to his colossal expectations he threatens them with public humiliation at the very least. The film is divided into three well defined acts. The first starts in 1984, the launch of the failed Apple Macintosh. The second in 1988, the NeXT computer and finally the iMac in 1998 this acts as somewhat of a rebirth for the talented Steve Jobs. Danny Boyle centres these three acts primarily upon the conflicts that Jobs has with his family; namely his former girlfriend Chrisann Brennan and Lisa his daughter that he does not acknowledge as his own child for some time. These confrontations give Steve Jobs a dramatic centre and heart. It helps us identify with the character even when he makes things exceedingly difficult for the people that work around him. However, this sudden shift in timelines does add a disorientating effect that the film could do without. The time jump from 1984 to 1988 is largely inconsequential and works well. It allows us time to see the growth of the characters and their maturity likewise increases. Or in the case of Jobs his arrogance and egotistical side takes over and is more readily apparent than before. But the time gap from 1988 to 1998 does indeed hurt the film from a dramatic standpoint. Any drama built up from the strongly constructed first two acts bears little meaning or resemblance to speak of in the third. It still has drama and by any means is not a bad way to end the film. It just renders everything that came before almost meaningless, almost.Whenever the film gets bogged down in these details it springs gracefully back up and snaps into shape. You cannot deny the sheer power of the film. This emanates through every line of Aaron Sorkin's memorable dialogue. The script is many things and is surely smart, swift and engaging until the very end. It is not as witty as The Social Network but it matches it for intellect and ingenuity. Because of the break ups in acts it never maintains the flow and focus of David Fincher's masterpiece, but it is still writing at its most uniformly excellent. If every script in Hollywood was up to the level of quality that Sorkin's is then each film that came out would be a must see for every audience member across the world. Despite its shortcomings, Danny Boyle's latest is just that; a film that demands to be seen by anyone who can appreciate spectacular writing and directing on any level.Boyle's directing is stunning and does not take center stage like before. He lets the real stars of the show shine brightest like writer Aaron Sorkin and the actors that soar at every opportunity that they are given to do so. Michael Fassbender as Steve Jobs is a masterstroke. No matter how many times he is threatening or forceful to his members of loyal staff we still care about his troubles, worries and doubts. There is a sadness that is aching deep inside him; we only see this more vulnerable side of his personality in the time that he spends alone with his daughter Lisa.But the real breakthrough here is Seth Rogen. Not exactly the kind of person I thought capable of delivering a thought provoking character performance steeped in nuance, but there you have it. If it was not for Michael Fassbender on top form he would steal the show. As Steve Wozniak creator of the Apple II he is the most sympathetic character of the bunch. Yet he never demands it. He just embraces the role with grace and comes out victorious. Rogen, I plead you to stop making stoner comedies. They are beneath you, please only make films where you can shine with the material that is given to you!Steve Jobs is a highly entertaining, intellectual and thoughtful piece of cinema. It combines Danny Boyle, Aaron Sorkin and Michael Fassbender in a near masterpiece of modern cinema for any adult audience member. It demands to be seen, not just once, but twice. Hollywood is all too lacking when it comes to films crafted with this complexity, ingenuity and script smarts.",10,1,3,25 November 2015
Love Actually," Like Actually
","It's a darned shame that Love Actually is only just okay, I like it; but the film's title is misleading for the most part. It definitely has likability, which when it comes to Romantic Comedies is somewhat of a miracle. Yet I have no capacity to love it, which the film wants me to, so frequently throughout the runtime that it can be a little unnerving. At certain moments it feels like the director is nudging the audience to chuckle, which when you are aiming for laughs in a film that has a high concept as much as this, is a little odd. The laughs for scenes with particular couples feel forced and unnatural; when I did laugh felt sorry for the film trying to hint that the certain scene or gag is in fact amusing.The film involves about eight couples in the weeks leading up to Christmas at London. It follows their antics and what they do in the countdown to Christmas, whether it is trying to get the Prime Minister's attention or one of the school teachers to like you. The characters themselves range from porn doubles to one guy who has fallen very deeply for his best friend's fiancée; so I cannot fault the film for its ambition or scale which is no mean feat upon Richard Curtis's part in particular, him being the director and the writer I am sure that most of the film was under careful consideration. Other parts I feel are not; it is really annoying that the flaws sometimes overlook the positive elements of the film.It is however, an exceedingly charming film that has infrequent laughs which can sometimes make the whole affair seem a bit dull, especially when it comes to the segments that have little humour, charm or even an actual point for that matter. In particular a scene with one of the characters trying to get girls to like him and repeatedly have sex. Fortunately the best moment comes from Bill Nighy as a singer who does not realise how bad his record is. Nighy can always make a film that is middle of the road, much better than it has any right to be and this is the case with Love Actually.Thankfully, the ending is fulfilling, much more so than some of the other elements that just feel there to add to the already unwieldy length. I cannot help but feel disappointed what with the amount of potential it had and most of which is wasted or lost amid all the different sub plots. It can be hard to get your head around a film like this, and it is certainly much more complex than it needed to be.A more appropriate title would be Like Actually. There are key elements that light up the whole affair and others that just crave the attention they feel, but in no way do they actually deserve. With many gaping flaws through the film; some that run fairly deeply, I cannot see why people adore Love Actually as much as they do.",6,0,3,30 June 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," A Summer Blockbuster with Brawn and Brains
","On paper Edge of Tomorrow does not sound so special - it would seem to be a retread of other films. It is in basic terms another action vehicle for Tom Cruise to hold upon his shoulders as the lead. What sets it apart from it's adversaries is that it is incredibly unique and wholly its own. The director - Doug Liman of The Bourne Identity fame creates a film that has an intricate, complex and compelling structure. We see Cruise as Major William Cage a member of the United Defence Forces who is called to London to meet with the general; whom states his intention to combat what is known as an alien race called Mimics who have taken over the majority of Europe. The General tells Cage he will be leading the other soldiers of the Unit to war. Cage refuses and well you can guess what happens. Stripped of his rank he is sent on the eve of the battle to an operating base and the following day bloodshed ensues. Cage dies and mysteriously reawakens at the operating base the previous day. He dies and is reborn, again and again and again. Each time trying to learn from his mistakes and help the soldiers win the war. In this sense the film resembles a well worn concept, which has helped many films out in the past - that of repeating a particular incident, until it is done correctly. Films such as Groundhog Day and Source Code. It is refreshing because this could easily have been a cash grab, depriving teenage boys of their pocket money until the next Transformers flick hits the big screen. It is to my absolute delight and extreme pleasure that I can say this is not at all the case here. The concept is given a fresh, invigorating use which is not wasted. It turns it inside out and makes it as good as if not better than the films mentioned above. It could have turned out as messy as Bay's ill favoured franchise if it was not for the clever, witty script that relishes giving its characters and Cruise's in particular that key human element, which without it the film would be lost. Also deserving of merit is the narrative structure which worms its way in and out often looping back upon itself and shaking the audience with anticipation, every twist and turn it throws at them. The action is exhilarating and is bound to keep your pulse pounding until the credits roll. You can actually tell what is going on! Which in the 21st century is something of a marvel when one considers how many action films are littered with poor editing and bad framing of shots. Liman knows how to direct a great action film and all that is here showcases his talent for the genre and knack for it all. The film knows what it is to feel alive, making it feel fresh and brand new. Cruise and his eventual trainer played with the required fierceness and stunning dedication to the role by Blunt is one of the key elements to elevating this film above the likes of an average action flick. They both own their roles and you can completely buy their character's continuing development and feelings throughout. Liman proves that an action blockbuster can have brawn, brains and a human heart. This is no small feat considering the mostly lifeless and soulless work that is on offer all the time at your local cinema. Take this lively reinvention of the genre as to what the director can achieve and the possibilities seem endless. How Liman will top this is anybody's guess - but I for one will be there at the front of the queue as soon as he is helming another action film.",8,0,2,30 June 2014
Whiplash," An Intense Thrill Ride Anchored by Star Turning Performances
","Music has never really been my thing – unless you count film soundtracks and not many people do. So it thrills me to say that this film had me in shock when I left the cinema. I felt like I was on a drug, a drug that only a film like 'Whiplash' could provide.'Whiplash' is in a way unique – it is not a thriller yet it grips from start to finish like only a masterfully created film could. So although this film is a Drama, it is incredibly intense always opting for the hardest, most difficult route. It never holds back and for some it may make the film difficult to swallow. It is this tendency towards filmmaking that hearkens back to the great, unforgettable Alfred Hitchcock. Is it a film that matches his greatest work – 'Vertigo'? I would argue, yes. The Director appreciates film not just as entertainment, but as an art form as well. Take note Michael Bay.Every overriding factor of this film excels. I for one was not overly keen about a film that concerns a driven drummer. Yet the beauty of this film is that it pulls you in and overwhelms all of your senses.The script is pitch perfect in every way imaginable. We are always primarily concerned with Andrew, masterfully played to the full potential by Miles Teller, who now has an astonishing film to add to his CV. Andrew wants to become one of the great drummers of the world and Teller's performance could just be the start of him maturing as an actor. I really hope he pays attention to scripts like these in the future.J K Simmons revels in the ugly side of his character, literally the only side. Not to say that he is a weak character, because he sure is well written. There is no other word to describe his performance, scary. He plays the determined Mr who doesn't care if he has to throw a chair at your head to bring out the best in you. This man is determined to not let anything get in the way of his band being the best that the world has ever heard. Yes, he doesn't have an ethical code and believes the only way to get Andrew at his peak is to torture him mentally and physically. J K Simmons will get the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor and if he doesn't then I could not care less about the Oscars. He even adds a bit of snarky humour in there for good measure. He is a teacher you cannot trust, be picked as lead drummer one day, miss a beat the next and it is all over for you. Making the dramatic stakes in the film even higher and becoming all the more engrossing for it.This films soundtrack makes it even more heart racing and is the key for the film's success. If this music is poor then the majority of audience members will switch off straight away. It isn't and I could listen to Miles Teller drumming for his life all day, pouring sweat, pain and blood into his work – not just metaphorically either.Although relationships in the film account for less than fifteen percent of it - they add a layer of depth to the characters and make them more fragile and nuanced. Andrew struggles to explain the situation to his girlfriend and ends up saying the wrong thing in the process. As his drumming career become more important than ever, he is left with some difficult choices to make. He cannot have his girlfriend and his career at the same time, one of them has got to go.Another thing that I could not get over was the editing and the cinematography. As Andrew's drumming gets louder and the beat and tempo quicken, the editing is more sudden with quick cuts and the camera work is more jarring. One key image that will stay with me forever is when Andrew plunges his bloody hands into a bucket of his ice. The screen is white and suddenly turns blood red. Andrew pushes himself beyond the limit, no matter the cost or the pain to his own body.If it was up to me the film would run over three hours, unfortunately it cannot. So instead we are left with under two hours of filmmaking bliss. Every cast member is on top form and shatter expectations. The camera work is stellar, Teller and Simmons give us a powerful dynamic to their relationship as student and mentor, and the score is any composer's idea of heaven. If this film doesn't make it into your Top Ten Films of 2014, then I'd advise seeing a doctor, you're brain clearly isn't functioning well.",10,0,2,14 January 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Scorsese on Top Form
","Although I would like to say I'm a Scorsese fan, in all truth I can't. Having only seen three of his films from his long and much talked about career, it would not be right for me to say so. But, having watched 'The Wolf of Wall Street' I already feel like one.The Wolf of Wall Street makes a strong case for the best and most enjoyable film of the year. Leonardo DiCaprio owns the role and it feels like he was born to play Jordan Belfort, the real life character on which this story is based. The film is set between the 1980s and 90s, it sees Belfort making his way up in Wall Street from only able to sell penny stocks in a small building to making his own company and working with hundreds in a large office. DiCaprio gives it his all, sniffing, shouting and screeching with all his might and emerges with a performance like no other. Many have argued that Belfort is a character that is vile, repulsive and vulgar. Granted he may be at certain points in the film, yet it is the voice-over that truly gives the film an impact and makes us care about his character (not too dissimilar to the one used in GoodFellas by Ray Liotta). It enables the audience to relate to Jordan Belfort in a way that would not be as powerful or poignant without it.The minor characters, played by Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie are an unexpected welcome. Especially when I doubted Hill would be able to pull his role off, yet he does a marvellous job of it as Donnie Azoff, Belfort's right hand man. Always funny and excellently acted by Hill, there is no one else who could do a better job. Robbie as Naomi Lapaglia, Belfort's eventual wife brings sexiness and believability to her role and appears to relish every scene she is in.At its core it is a film about excess and how this can be our downfall, wanting, more and more. Belfort spends his earnings (gained illegally by misguiding customers, therefore making it almost impossible for them to gain a profit) on drugs, women and among many other things his own private yacht with a helicopter, as you do. In most points of the film his humanity is driven alarmingly close to the edge.Yet, Scorsese and his screen writer Terence Winter fill the film with jokes that we cannot help but laugh, almost entirely throughout its three hour run time. Many of the laughs are unexpected and that certainly helps, with an odd moment involving Belfort and Azoff completely off of their heads and a telephone cord led to me crying with laughter!All in all this is a perfect film with spectacular performances from the cast. It sees Scorsese at his best bringing the characters to life and even in their most questionable moments making them people that will still care about. At three hours the film never drags or lets up, there are always neat little touches that Scorsese provides – deliberate continuity errors when Belfort is high. The non-stop humour helps and guarantees the audience a good time and the most avid film fan left in waiting for the next Scorsese film.",10,4,11,3 March 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," A Missed Opportunity That Started With Promise
","Thirteen years. That's the time gap between 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' and the release of 'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies'. It is impossible for the Hobbit trilogy to avoid comparisons with its book written by J. R. R. Tolkien and 'The Lord of the Rings' Trilogy.Since the age of six I have had an investment in this series in particular; its characters, story and world. As time passes by I feel my attachment lessen not for 'The Lord of the Rings' (my love only grows) but for 'The Hobbit'. I consider 'Rings' to be a flawless trilogy and one of the best, which stands alongside the original 'Star Wars' Trilogy and 'The Dark Knight' Series. So let's discuss 'The Hobbit'. The book written in 1937 is little more than 200 pages in comparison to 'Rings' which is over 1000. This extension from one book being split into three films is almost heart-breaking. But I do not hate the films.'An Unexpected Journey' is a slog, but it does have its moments. It is without a doubt far too long, although we do see the return of Bilbo, Gandalf and Gollum. For me this is enough, even if we catch only a fleeting glimpse of the Dragon Smaug. I consider it adequate, but still partially a let-down.'The Desolation of Smaug' raises the stakes and is just a black arrow shy of the masterful trilogy that preceded it. The characters are better realised, the action is more cohesive and the scene between Bilbo and Smaug is one of the greatest confrontations in cinema history.'The Battle of the Five Armies' is in fact an altogether different beast. A strong start only makes it so much more of a shame, when the whole story comes cascading down into fiery oblivion. In this instalment we continue the story mere minutes after the last film ended. This is disorientating as Smaug has already begun his destruction of Lake Town. While this scene could have easily been the ending of the second it still works. Benedict Cumberbatch is aggressive and his temperament matches Smaug's wit and skill. However, the first fifteen minutes is not enough and cannot single handedly save the film from betraying its origins.This film sees a massive Battle of the Five Armies. This includes the dwarfs, elves, eagles and orcs; so even the title is misplaced. Instead a Battle of Four Armies takes place. Bilbo is stuck in the middle of all of this, whilst Thorin Oakenshield upon acquiring the Arkenstone loses his mind faster than you can say 'my precious'. The battle can be described using these words; convoluted, repetitive, long, drawn out and no fun. It drags for over an hour and contains more CGI effects than you can shake Gandalf's staff at. But all of them save for Smaug, look tacky and worse than they did in 2001.Martin Freeman as the anxious Bilbo tries to steer the film away from badness. You can tell he is trying his best. Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee have less to do this time around, but they are at least never less than captivating and draw our attention on screen when the battle sequences cannot.The score sounds suitably epic by series regular Howard Shore. The film looks neat, when CGI is not filling the screen, granted this is rare. What is most unforgivable though is the direction Peter Jackson takes with his limited source material to work from. In the book, the battle happens, but Bilbo is knocked out and therefore we only see how it starts and ends. Roughly 75% of 'Battle of the Five Armies' is Jackson's imagination. We find ourselves lost. Character development is thrown out of the window. We can no longer tell who is fighting who; elves defy physics worse than Neo in 'The Matrix' and a plethora of characters are killed off without the audience shedding a single tear. You end up rooting for the orcs instead; especially when Alfrid is on screen in supposedly comical scenes. Amounting to cringe inducing awfulness. That provides no function for the story. Alas, the love story here is worse than before and shows that Jackson should have stuck to his source and not have become high off of fumes of his own imagination.'The Battle of the Five Armies' acts as a conclusion to 'The Hobbit' Trilogy and brings the Saga full circle. If 'An Unexpected Journey' was 'The Phantom Menace', 'The Desolation of Smaug'; 'Revenge of the Sith'. Then this instalment is certainly 'Attack of the Clones' with further unthinkable flaws. I advise you watch the previous two films and stick to the book. It is exciting and not at all painful like the film.",5,0,1,6 April 2015
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," A Soaring Achievement
","If there's one thing that Birdman proves it's that Michael Keaton can still own a role. This time he is poking fun at the superhero genre and the fact that he has played Batman in the past makes his appearance all the more poignant.Because of the title's more than obvious hint at a superhero, some of us may be forgiven for thinking that the film concerns one. It doesn't. Instead we get a look at the deteriorating career of an actor, one that coincidentally (?) parallels that of the great Keaton. He plays Riggan who in order to restore his falling reputation (he says he turned down Birdman 4, 20 years ago) he decides to direct, write and star in his adaptation of a play no less, but that does not come without consequences and various people to contend with. As if this wasn't enough to make audiences drool we are treated to a magnificent performance from Edward Norton who appears in due course. He gives everything that he possesses with such powerful acting that it rivals his other performances. I would go as far to say his role in 'Fight Club', which astonished audiences everywhere.What follows is one of the greatest films of 2014 and in fact the twenty first century. Even actors I had thought incapable of acting on a dramatic level impress me and that you can be sure is saying something. Particularly Zach Galifianakis (known for is role of a buffoon in 'The Hangover' Series) who shows restraint and a sense of control or some at least over Keaton's character, as his lawyer. The female leads also astonish, namely that of Emma Stone and Naomi Watts – but when have they ever let us down? Stone here is in vast contrast to her role in the 'Spider-Man' series, which was sweet; here she is (dare I say it) bitter with her father, as well as a drug addict and practically uncontrollable. Watts ends up a bit off of the rails, but hey who can blame her?I don't think that anyone would have liked Edward Norton trying to have a quick shag with you before the main event. But there is always some who wouldn't mind. I feel the need to be brief or as brief as is possible for me. It is literally magic on screen from the acting, to the set design, score, cinematography, humour (every joke finds its mark and will have you grasping the air to still breathe) and oh my script! I don't think that one has been as punchy since Aaron Sorkin's for 'The Social Network'. Need I say more? This is the first I have heard of Alejandro González Iñárritu but I will be sure to follow him religiously now. Whether you are a casual film-goer or someone who considers themselves a cinephile – just do yourself a favour and see this masterpiece! It is quite possible that you will not feel this way about a film for a very long time!",9,8,19,4 January 2015
Fifty Shades of Grey," A Glorified Porno for Repressed Young Women
","Understandably you may have been led to believe from Fifty Shades of Grey's marketing that it is edgy, racy and sexy. It is none of the above, yes you heard me correct and have been sorely mislead, but at least the marketing was highly successful.It is necessary to understand how the film came about, no pun intended. It was adapted from the poorly written book of the same name by 'author' E. L. James, which in turn was adapted from a fan fiction of 'Twilight', all of this figures. Many of the plot points and events are parallels to the 'Twilight' saga and lines like 'I'm not the man for you' feel directly lifted from it. But at least the film gets some things right, which is another way of saying barely anything at all. The film is well shot which is unsurprising when it is Seamus McGarvey who photographed the exquisite Avengers. However, this becomes redundant when the film you are photographing is utter trite. The music though, sounds like the things of wet dreams, yet never quite reaches the full potential of composer Danny Elfman, who is somewhat underutilized, as the majority of the film has techno pop songs thrown into the sound scape. 'Love Me Like You Do' is as expected the best element of Fifty Shades and Ellie Goulding's vocals accelerate the intimacy very well. I would rather listen to it a hundred times on a loop than watch the two or three inevitable sequels, depending on whether they split the last book in half.One more element that must be considered before I go on an endless rant is Dakota Johnson who plays Anastasia Steele sounding awfully like a female porn star. She gets the chance to interview renounced Billionaire Christian Grey and they build a rapport to say the least. Johnson really should not be here leaving a giant mess of a film making a bad impact on her limited filmography. If this is the one that she expected to launch her into the atmosphere then God help her. She does the best with what she is given bless her. Mainly biting her lip and trembling with anticipation to be punished by Mr. Grey played by Jamie Dornan who has no idea what he is doing in any scene that he is in, it begs the question; does he even know how to have sex? Dornan is just plain and simply bland and bad, he delivers his lines with the dramatic resonance of a new comer to a soap opera. Almost winking at the camera like a reality TV star from Geordie Shore. At least he has the looks because otherwise he would have nothing going for him, this level of acting I expect to find in a low budget pornographic film, not a Hollywood Blockbuster or is that Block Basher?Which unfortunately brings me to the script. I do not think there has been one this awful and misguided since 'Twilight', 'The Last Airbender' and 'After Earth'. It is the work of four amateurs (or at least it feels that way) and it sticks out like a sore thumb. How four people mashed together this terrible script is beyond any comprehension because it stinks. I have seen better work by one person, Aaron Sorkin, he seems to be one of the few script writers that actually possesses a working brain. The lines do induce laughs, but unintentional ones. You never feel that Grey and Steele are connected emotionally; they are only together because the script is insistent that they are. I fail to see what Anastasia gets out of their sexual encounters apart from losing her cherry. Mr Grey spanks her butt and that is all there is to it. No chemistry whatsoever. Dornan is like a plank of wood, but Johnson reaches to inject her character with some well needed development and tries to make sparks fly, they are just nowhere to be seen. If this is true love, then I think I have more sexual tension with my Blu- ray Surround Sound System.It is far too long and padded to the limit; and I thought 'The Hobbit' and 'The Hunger Games Mockingjay' where stretched to the max, within an inch of their lives. We have to sit through endless talking about mundane topics, which will seem sexual to a male audience under the age of twelve and a female audience under the age of sixteen. In the UK, 'Fifty Shades of Sh*te' is an 18, so they are unable to view it. The only audience members it therefore has are forty-year-old women who have tragic sex lives and unwilling couples who are fooled into watching it because it is released on Valentine's Day.Yes, there are sex scenes and we see Johnson's boobs and butt. However, this does not mean it is worth the ticket price; I do not care how amazing they both are! Dornan simply stares at her like the male equivalent of Bella and there we have it Twilight with rough sex! Which includes BDSM, but the writers seem to have glanced at what a Wikipedia page can tell you! There is no understanding prevalent in the film and Steele seems to be uncomfortable as her bum is slapped about. Just a hint, now might be the time to use your safe word.I can go on for no longer and cannot review what is the worst excuse for a film and not only the worst film of 2015, but also the worst film ever made. 'Batman and Robin' you have been robbed of your kingly crown. Don't take your loved one to see it. You may lose them forever. Just have a romantic night in with any of the following films, 'Titanic', 'Annie Hall', 'Beauty and the Beast', '(500) Days of Summer' or 'Her'. Save yourself from this colossal cum stain of a film.",2,5,15,14 February 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," DC's Most Popular Superheroes Collide
","It's hard to know where to begin with Batman V Superman. A film so desperate to set up DC comic's cinematic future that it forgoes any attempt at being coherent, having a solid script and gaining narrative momentum.After the destruction of half of Metropolis in Man of Steel, Batman is understandably furious. Superman is seemingly on free rein doing as he pleases. This leads to what the title implies a gladiator match between DC's beloved heroes.If that synopsis sounds befuddling it's because the film is a narrative disaster. So confusing at times that the storytelling borders on incoherent. Scenes jump from location to location subplot to subplot without establishing the necessary ingredients for a story such as this that demands depth. Character motivations are at best bizarre and many situations are never fleshed out. It makes sense why Batman faces off against Superman, but Superman's reason feels contrived. There are still interesting moments that inspire wonder such as how the public regards Superman as a God and yet many still fear his powers. But moments such as these are all too brief and the story cuts away from them just as they start to develop.There are far too many characters thrown into the mix, but Affleck as Batman manages to make an impression – he is darker and more tormented than ever before. The scenes with Bruce Wayne/Batman are the best parts of the film, but when the character is all too often pushed to the side it hurts the production. In regards to Jesse Eisenberg's villainous Lex Luthor you have to wonder what was going through his head. Its agonizing to watch his scenes unfold of which there are a great many.The fight itself which would seem to be the main event of the film almost feels like an afterthought. Arriving nearly two hours into the film it looks visually stunning but barely lasts three minutes. It's all too little too late.Will Batman V Superman be a financial success? Undoubtedly. But if DC wants to stay ahead of the competition and come out on top, they would be wise to focus on the characters and what makes them tick rather than noisy and choppily edited CGI spectacle.

Casino Royale," Bond's Back
","So after 4 years Bond is finally back in action and what better way to reboot the franchise than to start the story off with Fleming's original novel of the same name. This entry sees Bond play in a high stakes poker game to stop Le Chiffre from organising terrorism in a bid to control the world's stock market. From each stunning location we get a sense that time is of the essence. When Bond journeys through Madagascar to stop a bomb maker (who can free run) we feel that Bond has trouble keeping him in his sights and that is spectacular to watch as the greenery is definite eye candy and glorious to behold.First off though, Daniel Craig is a ruthless and exhilarating Bond and whilst he may not be as cool as Pierce Brosnan or as humorous as Roger Moore, one thing for sure he has brought his own interpretation to the much loved character of 007, and boy is it welcome!Each action element just adds to the adrenaline and tension of the scene. From the fight on the stairs to the collapse of a house in Venice; the stunts vary adding to the pure excitement of each scene and Daniel Craig's on screen confidence makes it all the better to behold.As for the musical score, this has to be David Arnold's greatest score to date with the bond theme appearing only at the last scene of the entire movie, making all Bond fans shout with delight. However the greatest piece is Miami International which is surprisingly incredible to listen to and is guaranteed to keep you entertained even if it does last over ten minutes!Also the acting is believable, even from the leading lady played by Eva Green, she handles the role superbly well. Making the character of Vesper Lynd the most complex of the entire series, Bond doesn't even go to bed with her until the last half an hour of the film! What's more is that she doesn't immediately succumb to Bond's advances and at first she seems wary. She is not as eager to see Bond as he is to see her.Verdict: This is well and truly the best entry to a much beloved franchise, that has got back to the basics after much CGI tinkering in Die Another Day (it has the worst use of CGI ever for a Bond movie) and it feels realistic and gritty in its approach. The director (Martin Campbell) has done us proud. It's only a shame he wasn't able to direct Quantum of Solace which lacked an interesting plot and decent characterisation. All we can hope for is that Skyfall (released October 26th) can come back and make Bond fans forget about the mishaps of QoS. 10/10",10,5,9,15 September 2012
Lucy," 100% Brain Power? Besson uses less than 10%
","Every once in a while a film like 'Lucy' comes along. One that is incredibly ambitious but so poorly executed that you can't help but feel sorry for the overall product. It pains me to type this, when a project has such great potential starts to stumble and ends up tripping its own feet over.Luc Besson the director and writer of 'Lucy' knows what he is doing behind the camera. Throughout it he creates undeniably beautiful images on screen. If only the rest of the film was on par with the camera work then I would be jumping for joy. I might have actually had more fun with Lucy if I wasn't treated like a dumb audience member from the get-go. Obvious imagery of a cheetah hunting its prey intercut with a scene of Lucy being surrounded by gang members – isn't what you want to show your audience especially if they have an IQ higher than a 10 year old.'Lucy' stars Scarlett Johansson in the title role; she is given a drug (against her own free will) that will increase her brain power from 10% to 100%. I can admire Johansson for trying to inject human emotion – for the first 15 minutes, then her character becomes devoid of any, which left me emotionally disconnected with her character; that and her blatant disregard for human life. After she has the drug in her bloodstream we get to see what she can do with her power. This ranges from being able to read people's minds to virtual omnipotence. Sound familiar? If it does then it should be no surprise that Lucy is what I would term a superhero. Yet the film lacks what makes them interesting – a strong villain and suspense.Min-sik Choi who plays the villain (Mr Jang) is given so little to do that he might as well be called obligatory henchman for unnecessary conflict. It is a shame when the lead actor of Oldboy (2003) is in a film far below him. His character is no match for Lucy; as with a flick of her wrist she can magically use the force and send her enemies flying against the wall. He can do nothing to stop her – see where I'm getting at with the obligatory villain concept? Lucy can do anything and her enemies virtually nothing, so we don't even need a villain present at all. No one can challenge her effectively, thus stopping any tension within the film. I'm really trying hard to find something positive apart from the visuals. Morgan Freeman is great – but when wasn't he? Unfortunately although he gives his all, he cannot stop the film from venturing on the wrong side of camp. Again I come to another element of the film which Besson can't seem to decide upon. The tone of the film; it never knows when to be serious or silly – in the end when he mixes scenes of seriousness and one-liners they end up just cancelling themselves out. Leaving me very confused as to what the director was aiming for.An intriguing premise but weak story stops 'Lucy' from being 'The Matrix' game changer it should have been. The biggest compliment I can give the film is that it isn't painful to watch; just irritating that a film maker with talent fails to make 'Lucy' suspenseful, or for that matter interesting.",4,0,3,6 January 2015
Godzilla," The Monster Mash
","Summer Popcorn Fare. These are the words that spring to mind when I think about Godzilla in retrospect. When I left the cinema (I saw this film in IMAX), I was quite pleased with the overall product. Of course it is better than Roland Emmerich's 1998 incarnation; you only have to look at the trailers and even the posters to know that much is true. Gareth Edwards directs the film smoothly with the appropriate tension that is needed to propel the action scenes forward. Edwards reveals Godzilla slowly and carefully, it is only in the second half that we witness it in all its enormous, scaly glory. This is a director that knows exactly what he is doing and has a complete vision that he is carrying towards the audience. The film however is a completely different beast than that of last year's Pacific Rim. Which was loud, big and brash, not that I have any problems with that. Many audience members may want to know this fact before hand. Although there are several great action set pieces; one on a train is a highlight with a monster trying to kill as many people as possible, if you can overlook the other elements you may find excitement. Also, look out for a fight between Godzilla and the other monster, which is reminiscent of King Kong taking on a T-Rex. The action set pieces overall are few and far between until the last half hour or so. This is a criticism of many Hollywood blockbusters and does not reflect on just Godzilla at all. The film itself is well paced up until this point, it almost feels like the director felt obliged to put them there, just in case audiences felt shortchanged.When it comes to drama to propel the plot and story forward, the film trips itself up and in a big way. This is sad to see because underneath all the dramatic elements here is a film that had the potential to be an epic, in terms of its scale, story and dramatic tension. Possibly the last and most important element is lacking and that is why I feel disappointed.Though thought has gone into the film, the irony is that about an hour or so after seeing the film the initial buzz seemed to wear out and I did indeed feel shortchanged, but not for the reasons one might think. When you view Godzilla in the IMAX format your brain seems like it has been left at home. The reason I feel this way is that unfortunately this feels in far too many ways similar to another film that I would term – Summer Popcorn Fare. Sadly it is a film that was released seven years ago. You guessed correctly – Transformers, and Michael Bay directed that film. Bay made the dramatic elements laughable at best – with no relatable characters and this is exactly how I felt about this film. The characters seem more like caricatures then anything else, limp, and lifeless, without any joy or depth. They seem to have just had bullet points listed as their traits in the pre production process. Sadly it seems little has changed from that point. Take the character of Aaron Taylor Johnson, he resembles the all action, relatable hero or is supposed to, films like Die Hard have done this much better which is annoying. With a monster film you need relatable heroes and this film is completely devoid of them.The fact is Godzilla takes itself way too seriously for me to enjoy and indulge in it. The concept of a huge monster roaming around a city is laughable at best, a true Director would know that the concept is ludicrous and needs to be taken with a pinch of salt. Brighten the atmosphere, stop making it as serious as The Dark Knight and lighten up! Almost every character seems extremely sad at some point in this film. Am I the only one that would laugh myself silly when Godzilla attacks? Probably. Even so a few jokes and hints that this is stupid would make it more enjoyable without entering the realm of Camp.It is my sad duty to report what could have been an enjoyable, exciting entry in the franchise is not so much Godzilla's roar as a colossal bore. The clichéd cardboard characters and dull script do not help matters and the set pieces cannot elevate this film from being a mediocre entry. For much better monster epics see the nearly decade old King Kong. You'll find much more joy watching it for the tenth time, than watching Godzilla for the first. If a sequel really is on the cards then Edwards get yourself a new screenwriter.",5,6,11,26 May 2014
Kingsman: The Secret Service," An Uncensored Bond, for a New Generation
","Comic book and graphic novel adaptations are something of a speciality for Director Matthew Vaughn. He has proved his worth with the ultra-violent 'Kick-Ass', the superior 'X-Men First Class' and now the stylish 'Kingsman: The Secret Service'. He is in my eyes one of the most original Directors working today. 'Kingsman' sees him at the top of his game and with the upcoming release of the twenty fourth Bond film later this year, what better time to release this spy parody.Now, the English have had a poor track record when it comes to spy spoofs. If 'Johnny English' was a guilty pleasure then 'Storm breaker' was definitely a disappointment to say the least. But 'Kingsman' works so well on multiple levels and even the plot is pleasurable.With the untimely death of two Kingsman agents, the others working in the field must find two suitable replacements. One of the candidates happens to be the son of a Dead agent from a botched mission that took place in 1997. He is Gary Unwin or 'Eggsy' if you are his friend. First time actor Taron Egerton who plays him with edge and conviction, if this is his first role imagine what he could accomplish in the future. The candidates participate in the 'most dangerous job interview' they will ever get. Eventually Gary takes up the role of a Kingsman agent who is taught their prestigious ways by the smart and very talented Harry Hart played by Colin Firth. Whom still proves that he has got it, even if he is in his mid-fifties. I have heard that the majority of the action scenes he undertook himself and therefore I have to hand it to the man.Once the agents are assembled they must take down Valentine a villain with a lisp. Samuel L Jackson takes up the role. I would have thought that he would be unable to impress me as he is always able to outshine other major players. But, he proves that he is still one of the most dependable and bankable actors of this generation. Valentine hatches a plot to rid the world of those whom he deems are less than worthy to inhabit it. As he realises that the population is increasing the rate of global warming and must be taken care of. He wishes to carry out this plot through biological warfare with the help of amputee Gazelle whom has razor sharp legs that can pierce human flesh with ease. What follows is one of the best spy films and parodies ever created. This is because every single detail and element is handled with grace.One of the most important factors for a parody is the laughs. 'Kingsman' always delivers and makes me ever so thankful that the BBFC did not butcher this film and make it a 12A instead of the intended 15 certificate. It would lose half of its essence and almost every gag would land flat. Thankfully they do not and I had to use my arms to keep myself sitting straight and stop from falling face forwards onto the floor. Whether it be when the film takes the mickey out of the James Bond franchise, Valentine struggling with his ever so obvious lisp or the song that the villain plays to commence the end of the world, the film never falters where jokes are concerned.I will be brief here because with Vaughn behind the camera you know that the cinematography will be dazzling. But, also he is a Director who knows how to orchestrate fight scenes well, which is becoming increasingly rare for action films. One of the techniques that he uses to maximum effect is speeding up and slowing down the action. We get to see reactions more clearly and the full power of a single punch is never wasted. Rest assured the action is photographed spectacularly well and never descends into unwatchable shaky camera.The whole film maintains a sense of joy that is palpable throughout the two hour run time. The film is a sugar rush of the highest class. For the faint of heart it may be too much to handle; with the majority of characters free loading F bombs in every other sentence, heads exploding like shrapnel (to be honest it does have hundreds of deaths) and jokes about sex. But for others it will be a thrill ride that no other film can replicate or capture.For all action and spoof fans to miss out on 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' would be sacrilege to your country. Suit up, relax and freak out as Vaughn delivers a high octane, frequently funny and incredibly entertaining treat for teenagers and over around the whole globe. This is a younger, more daring and uncensored Bond for the new generation. If this was to be the next super spy franchise it would be joyous cause for celebration indeed. When it comes to furious action and elating energy, nobody does it better than Vaughn.",8,7,17,10 February 2015
Sin City," 'Worth Dying For, Worth Killing For, Worth Going To Hell For'
","These immortal words that issue from Marv's mouth before the killing of a corrupt Priest echo throughout the film. They actually act as a phrase that I myself would use to describe the lengths I would go to, so that I can watch the film time and time again. The film is adapted from the graphic novels that bear the title 'Sin City'. It is Frank Miller's own creation, his baby, and his masterpiece. It is only fitting that he is in charge of directorial duties with Robert Rodriguez and a certain special guest director by the name of Quentin Tarantino.Nothing has ever been made to the levels of artistry of 'Sin City' and nothing ever will be. The film is an exceptionally crafted one that defies reason, logic and gravity. But let me try my best to explain the plot or all three of them. This is because 'Sin City' is broken up to three acts but in UN chronological order as well as the prologue and immediate end of the picture. Just like Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction'. What is actually stupendous is that 'Sin City' stands on its own two bleeding legs.From the first opening shot, we are enlightened. The colour palette of the film is unique, with hues of black, white and grey, Miller choosing to occasionally add a splash of colour. Whether that be dazzling blue eyes, gorgeous blonde hair or the flowing ebb of red hot blood. In the opening prologue we see two characters upon a balcony, they gaze at each other, chat and embrace. The man promptly shoots her in the stomach. With almost an inaudible whisper he utters 'I'll never know what she was hiding from. I'll cash her cheque in the morning'. Welcome to Basin City; corruption, greed, gang violence, guns and prostitutes. It's a dirty place to live.Even Bruce Willis as the loyal and hardened Police Officer John Hartigan manages to get himself mixed up in it all. He is weary with grief and nervousness. Roark Juniour played creepily and jitterishly by Nick Stahl is on the hunt to rape and kill his fourth victim, eleven year old Nancy Callahan. Hartigan tries to prevent Roark from committing these atrocious acts. But with every life hanging in the balance there is a price to pay. Willis appears elevated by the screen time he gets, and offers a varied performance full of heart and soul. He is sad to have to say goodbye and so are we.The second distinct act of Sin City is devoted to the character of Marv, played with swaggering and scary intimidation by the never better Mickey Rourke. Marv wakes up after a one night stand only to find his lover Goldie, dead. He goes on a hunt to seek justice for this indecent crime. He even comes face to face with the silent but violent Kevin played gleefully but most astonishingly of all by Elijah Wood. What happened to the innocent little Hobbit from 'The Lord of the Rings'? It seems that even the best of people can turn awfully nasty from staying in a place like Basin City for too long. Kevin is more than a match for the brutish Marv and the tension was beyond excruciating. My heart almost left my body.The third and sadly final act of the film concerns Dwight played by the brilliant and truly marvelous Clive Owen. Dwight helps his girlfriend Shelley, when her ex-boyfriend the abusive Jackie Boy comes a calling; Benicio Del Toro who gives the film a stand out performance plays him with verve. Dwight convinces Jackie Boy to leave, in his own aggressive manner and then proceeds to follow him after he has left. Jackie Boy stupidly harasses a young and naïve prostitute in the seedier parts of the town, where the hookers run the joint and not the police force. All hell breaks lose and Dwight becomes entangled in the whole dramatic event as well.If you do not feel jolted by the events that take place, then perhaps you do not realise just how ballsy 'Sin City' really is, stylistically and structurally. The film never backs down or becomes scared of the gory levels of violence that it exhibits in unflinching detail. If you are faint hearted now might be the time to turn on 'Toy Story'.Furthermore, the music crackles and fizzes through the combined magic of Rodriguez and John Debney. The score reflects the horrific acts of violence on screen. But God help me, I was pummeling my fists into the ground for further sophistication, graphic violence and awesome score cues. Perhaps this film has changed my very nature, to the point where I am beyond redemption. But I figure, small price to pay for watching a bold, brutal and brilliant masterpiece of the twenty first century.Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller and of course the influential Quentin Tarantino work wonders and unleash all hell on screen with this graphic novel adaptation. Witty lines are ever present, grittiness overcomes all and the performances are bloody marvelous! The style that Miller adopts is directly lifted from every frame of the graphic novel and of course is eye popping! This just makes me scream for more! If 'Sin City' does not make the sick, twisted devil inside you shout with delight, then maybe you are best suited to watching the latest young adult novel adaptation instead.",10,1,3,10 March 2015
Spectre," Retro 007
","It must be difficult for the Director, writers, producers, stars and composers to mine unexplored areas for the franchise. Fifty three years since its inception and twenty four films down the line, Spectre proves that James Bond is still the most reliable spy franchise in cinematic history.Whilst taking a 'holiday' Bond hunts down a terrorist that former M (Judi Dench) wants him to dispatch, she left a message in her will. Soon it becomes clear that there is a bigger force involved. SPECTRE is causing global destruction once again and 007 will come face to face with his nemesis; Ernst Stavro Blofeld.Spectre starts with a stunning pre-credits sequence in Mexico during the day of the dead festival. It is this set piece that gets the ball rolling. The first shot of the film is unbroken reaching four minutes; we hold our breath and watch as Sam Mendes shatters our expectations for the second time in a row.If there has always been one element that the series has struggled with, let's face it, it is the women. Some are far too weak, dim witted or just plain irritating to bring anything worthwhile to the table. That's not the case here. One does serve as eye candy at the start of the film, but she is seen so briefly that it does not matter. Monica Bellucci's appearance though is stirring, even if she is given less screen time than she deserves. The real standout here though is Léa Seydoux (the star of the French film Blue Is the Warmest Colour) simultaneously fragile, strong minded and ferocious. She has just the right temperament which makes for an excellent Bond girl.Daniel Craig has finally settled into the role with a cock sure and suave performance, the highlight of his current tenure as Bond. Q gives 007 a few worthy gadgets. An exploding watch and a new Aston Martin DB10 that was commissioned specifically for its use in Spectre, complete with fire powered engine exhausts and the famed ejector seat. Christoph Waltz receives about as much screen time as Dr No in the first film; which is another way of saying that he barely appears. Yet his menacing presence is felt and accelerates the film whenever things begin to wind down. Mr Hinx (a brutal Dave Bautista) is a man of very few words. He draws similarities to Oddjob and is in all honesty a beast of a man. He dispatches his enemies with Game of Thrones – esque executions.The music by Thomas Newman serves the film better this time and is a delight to listen to, even without the accompaniment of the film. There are fresh call-backs to the series that earn praise and do not abuse Bond's substance and style; a fight on a helicopter (For Your Eyes Only), a blistering battle in a speeding train (From Russia with Love) and a chase in the Austrian Alps (On Her Majesty's Secret Service). There is even a neat tie in with the previous Craig entries that makes sense in the long run.Spectre is the greatest Bond film since Casino Royale; high praise, indeed. Mendes delivers on all fronts and as Bond fanatics and film buffs we are granted the Bond film that we deserve. Spectre also serves as a glorious call back to the golden days of 007; when the plot barely mattered, the action was thrilling and a film could be fun. As Bond's nemesis says 'Welcome James, it's been a long time'.",6,26,55,30 October 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," The Crowning Jewel of 2015
","For many years it appeared that George Miller had retired the Mad Max franchise which had fallen into disrepair. Well leaving the series for thirty years is bound to make it all the more difficult to return. With Fury Road, the fourth and now greatest film in the franchise, Miller is firing on all cylinders and the film is cinematic spectacle of the highest order.'My name is Max; my world is fire and blood'. The opening line delivered with gusto and grittiness by Tom Hardy tells us all we need to know. A) The character's name B) This is a world we are familiar with and C) It has collapsed as a society. But enough about the ins and outs of the film, what does Mad Max: Fury Road offer in way of plot? I can sadly imagine many unengaged viewers mumbling something to the sum of 'nothing' yet that's not at all true.Remember that 80s action film? The one you loved when you were an adolescent and as an adult still do. It had a plot. A simple one, which is all that is required. Not garbage a la Resident Evil or gibberish and confused drivel with its own agendas like recent deluge White House Down. The film that was succinct, straight to the point and did not wait for any man; Die Hard, Predator and The Terminator. Chances are if you're an action fan you have seen all three or at the very least heard of them. Fury Road abides by the same principle. It's not dumbed down and it's also not a bloated mess, running at a streamlined 120 minutes. It's not three hours long because it doesn't need to be.Mad Max: Fury Road is the story of Max, Furiosa and the tyrannical leader of the oppressed people, Immortan Joe. The crux of it all; Max is enslaved, little more than a blood donor to the sick dying war boys of Joe's Citadel. Max breaks free and begrudgingly teams up with Furiosa who is stealing Immortan Joe's five prized wives, in search of the fabled 'Green Place' to find rest, water and food. On this journey they attempt to outrun Joe and endure the heat of the ravaged Australian wasteland. But what makes Mad Max: Fury Road stand out from the crowd? What stops it from being the next embarrassment to cinema like Hit-man: Agent 47 or the Robocop remake? Is it at all worthy of a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes, Empire's highest grade and my recommendation? In short yes. But let me explain. What's wrong with action films nowadays? 1. No character development. When was the last time you cared about the fate of a character? Good or evil? The emotions they harbour, the chills they give you, the love you inhabit for them. Fury Road ensures that every character counts. The five wives have their own traits and definable personalities, Furiosa is the strongest female character that Hollywood has given birth to and despite so called evidence to the contrary, Max is never overshadowed and all the characters work in harmony with one another, building upon and breaking relationships throughout the natural progression of the story.2. Too much CGI. The best example; Superhero films, they look so fake that you wonder, is this what passes for realism? Miller throws CGI out of the window and pours gasoline over it for good measure. 99% of Fury Road utilises the limits of what practical effects can do. The other 1%? Colour grading and the melding of several key shots together. What you witness on screen is all real. From the rusting metal trucks down to the very dust that settles as they whizz past in and out of frame.3. Sub-par acting. Or as I refer to it – The Sam Worthington Effect. Whereby the action overshadows the performances. Not that they were terribly great to begin with anyway. It's not the case here. Charlize Theron excels as Furiosa, Tom Hardy grumbles with gravitas as Max and Hugh Keays-Byrne (Toecutter from Mad Max '79) is as riveting as he is horrifying as Immortan Joe. There is no way that Miller allows this trio to get lost in the mix and he handles the performances with due precision.4. Frenetic Editing. The killer of any hope of an excellent action film is all in the editing. Too many; Tak3n, The Expendables and Transformers, live or die by the hands of the edit. Fury Road doesn't just live, it breathes new life into the action genre. We can tell in any given shot, space of time or singular moment what is going on, when and why. Each frame is sped up or slowed down ensuring we never lose focus and the film throttles along at a considerable pace.But wait there's more! The music is loud and hefty in the thrilling action set pieces and quiet in the subtle character driven scenes of which there are a great many. The cinematography on the other hand deserves its own review. It's a cinephile's wet dream with John Seale capturing the expansiveness of the seemingly never ending desert and the tragic note of hope that Furiosa so desperately clings to.Hold on. Somethings not right. I haven't mentioned the action. Think of the most heart thumping scene you have experienced from a single film; times that by twelve, subtract awful editing and add enemies on nitro powered trucks, bikes, polecats and throw in a guitarist operating a flamethrower for good measure. That should give you an idea of what awaits you and how much adrenaline will be coursing through your veins after witnessing George Miller's action masterpiece that's the cinematic jewel of 2015 and one of the greatest action films of all time. The review ends here. There's only one thing left to say. See the movie. A+",10,3,12,1 January 2016
Macbeth," The Blood Soaked Tapestry of Macbeth
","Michael Fassbender can play any role you give him. Honest. 'Macbeth' is just further proof of that. Based on Shakespeare's play of the same name, 'Macbeth' is the tale of a man consumed by greed and power who murders his own king so that he can claim the throne for himself.'Macbeth' is not my type of film and yet I found myself won over, in spite of its notable pacing issues which drastically slow the film down in its second act. It's the high calibre of acting that works so well here. Fassbender consumes himself in the role and equally impressive is Marion Cotillard who plays his wife. Watching them hatch their plot and crumble when it fails is riveting. There are even a couple of bloody battles that bookend the film and for my money are worth the price of admission alone.Still I haven't mentioned the powerful poetic dialogue. Yes it is Shakespearean dialect and by its very nature is hard to understand and grasp at times. But in a strange way that makes it all the more interesting to watch and given time it grows on you and you come to appreciate the film for everything that it does right. Is this a faithful adaptation? Having had no previous knowledge about the play I could not say. Yet I know it's a fine and well-crafted film.'Macbeth' is a dark tale and as such the score in the film reflects that. Jed Kurzel brings a sad and symbolic soundtrack that signifies what power does to men and how it turns what was once good and pure into evil. From a visual standpoint 'Macbeth' is a sure fire winner. It possesses a cinematic beauty to it, one that the medium of television would be unable to bring forward.'Macbeth' is a poignant tale of a good man gone evil. If the dialogue is hard to understand at times and the pacing brings up issues it rarely matters; because the film is far often than not engrossing and Fassbender does justice to the source material. All Hail Macbeth!",8,4,7,21 October 2015
The Martian," Scott Brings Forth His Astonishing Talent
","'The Martian' is a hard film to analyse and critique. When a film is already held with reverence how can one hope to accomplish their goals? 'The Martian' was not the masterpiece I had been told to expect. Yet it is entertaining nonetheless that fails when drawn up in comparison against '2001: A Space Odyssey' and in more recent years; 'Gravity' and 'Interstellar'.Astronaut Mark Watney is having a bad day. He is stranded on Mars, help only 140 million miles away. He will have to put his survival skills to the limit as he tries to figure out how to survive on Mars and make contact with NASA so that he can eventually go home.Unfortunately, 'The Martian' is a troubled film. Its main problem is Matt Damon as Watney or rather just the character himself. In a film of this type, essentially a survival story against the backdrop of space you need a compelling and likable character to reach out and root for. Watney comes across as a snide and arrogant person, far too sure in his approach for his own good. Remember when characters used to have arcs, a la Phil in 'Groundhog Day', he changed from insufferable to a good person. The same cannot be said for Watney, which makes it increasingly hard for me to like him. I've said it a great many times and I will say it again. If the main character does not grab my attention, why should I care?Tone also remains a flaw. Should I really be laughing in a life or death situation? Would Watney be as cynical and witty if he knew for sure that he was not being observed? I doubt it.Still there's plenty of fun to be had with 'The Martian'. Especially if you are far more forgiving than I am. There are terrific performances across the board, most notably Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain and Chiwetel Ejiofor. The production design is astounding and the sets are creative and well thought out. The cinematography is gorgeous and highlights the vast wonders of Mars and how truly alone Watney is in this savage wasteland.'The Martian' could be termed the last chapter in the unofficial space exploration trilogy that began with 'Gravity' and 'Interstellar'. 'The Martian' may not possess the tension of 'Gravity' or the wonder of 'Interstellar' but it makes up for it with sharp scientific knowledge and an interesting take on the genre. Even if it's not my favourite film from Ridley Scott, it's a hard film to dismiss and dislike at the very least.",7,3,9,21 October 2015
Furious 7," Paul Walker Would Be Proud
","The Fast and Furious franchise is one that you cannot review objectively and in a serious manner. The films defy logic, reason and realism. It's a great job that they are damn entertaining then. The franchise never found its steering until 2011's 'Fast Five'. Strange that it has taken them five attempts to get it right. But with this, the seventh instalment they perfect it. The series has not changed so much, if anything it has gotten louder, dumber and more in your face than ever before. The creators realised that the plot is unimportant, what the audience values is inspired set pieces that go against the laws of physics, fast cars, and hot women and now it seems, characters that we very much care about. 'Fast and Furious 7' is a success that I am sure will qualify as the most outrageously entertaining film of the year.As soon as 'Fast and Furious 7' revs up its engine, it never stalls. This instalment begins right after the events of 'Fast and Furious 6' and 'Tokyo Drift', where Hans was killed by Deckard Shaw. He introduces himself through the immortal lines 'Dominic Toretto. You don't know me, but you're about to'. Deckard is after the crew who hospitalised his brother Owen and left him comatose in the previous film. Toretto played by the grizzly Vin Diesel, assembles his crew made up of Brian O'Connor (the likable Paul Walker in sadly his last film role), Letty (the feisty Michelle Rodriguez), Roman (a funny Tyrese Gibson), Tej (a bubbly Ludicrous) and Hobbs (the exhilarating Dwayne Johnson.) They are asked by a character that only refers to himself as Mr Nobody (an engaging Kurt Russell) to retrieve a device known as the God's Eye. It has the ability to track down anyone on the planet anywhere, within hours. The team need this device to find Deckard Shaw before he causes further devastating, destruction in his wake. But this hardly seems necessary as wherever the crew goes Shaw follows swiftly behind. Of course, it is a plot device with little importance to the overall arch of the story; it's only purpose to loosely connect a plot and allow for the madness and mayhem to unfold before our unbelieving eyes.In the first of many (Fast and Furious) set pieces we see Hobbs up against Deckard Shaw. Jason Statham does so well as the villain that it makes you wonder why he has been cast as a hero of a story so many times before. The action is very different and James Wan's technique is more frenetic, less polished and very gritty as opposed to Justin Lin's stylish approach. Even fans of 'The Bourne Trilogy' and the work of Paul Greengrass will have to hold onto their seat for dear life. Thankfully, it is always cohesive, just don't blink. The camera follows the movements of characters with ease and makes these fights far more entertaining than they have any right to be.Some may be disappointed by Dwayne Johnson's absence from the film for the most part. As he only appears at the start and the very end of the film. This however did not detract from the overall experience, as the scenes he does get are undoubtedly some of the craziest, insane and best for his character. So for me it did not matter in the slightest. If anything, it was a good thing as it allowed for more comradery between Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, reminding the audience that best friends are for life and your loved ones never truly leave you. Later in the film, Brian O'Connor tells Dominic Toretto that 'cars don't fly'. Toretto stares at him in a disapproving manner and proceeds to crash a Billionaire's Sports Car through two or more skyscrapers. Don't ask why. It does not even matter. You are so caught up in the moment that you forget plausibility.The dialogue in the film always allows for the characters to connect in many different ways be it; serious, funny and even (whisper it) deeply moving. Roman and Tej have no shortage of playful banter. Brian O'Connor and his wife Mia (a spectacular Jordana Brewster) convey emotion, depth and meaningful moments. They don't feel cheesy, even when they discuss the importance of friendship and family. Thank goodness, the director and the screenwriter got this right. Paul Walker's scenes with Vin Diesel boast the best connection between two characters in a very long time indeed. You are never left in any doubt that they were best friends in front of the camera and behind it as well.I have never heard of a film having two Directors of Photography, but 'Fast and Furious 7' does. The film is so staggeringly beautiful that I do not think one cinematographer would be able to convey such a high level of beauty in the exotic locales. The score by Brian Tyler gets the adrenaline pumping and the tear ducts flowing. Especially in the meaningful and moving 'See You Again' by Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth, what a beautiful tribute to Paul Walker, even listening to it now, I cannot stop crying. Who knew a film about cars and heists could be so powerful and tear jerking.'Fast and Furious 7' is by far the best instalment in the series. No small feat, when up against the fifth and sixth entries. The action is awesome, the stunts gravity defying and the cast pitch perfect. The script is great, the characters well developed and Paul Walker's send-off makes 'Fast and Furious 7' the most beautiful, poetic and emotional film I have seen in my life. I have no hesitation in stating that 'Fast and Furious 7' is perfect summer blockbuster entertainment and a masterpiece. So strap yourself in for the best ride yet. Rest in Peace Paul Walker. You would be Proud.",7,2,5,6 April 2015
