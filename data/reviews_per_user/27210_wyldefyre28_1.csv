Angels & Demons," SO Disappointed!
","I went to see the movie last night after just finishing the book on Monday night. They didn't just leave things out to streamline the story, they changed up a lot and left out a couple of the most important elements of the story (Kohler for one, the fact that the Carmelengo was NOT IRISH for another). The Carmelengo was portrayed as being just power-hungry and maybe delusional, when in reality there was SO much more going on there.I sat there and just sighed through the whole movie. Loudly. My boyfriend really enjoyed the movie and is now reading the book. I guess he did it in the right order. Yes, things were changed for the DaVinci code, but not to the same degree (in my opinion).it's good as a movie in and of itself, and if you know nothing of the book it might even be great. If you've read the book, though, prepare to be vastly disappointed.",3,2,7,20 May 2009
