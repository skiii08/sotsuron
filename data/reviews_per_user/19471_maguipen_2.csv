Howl's Moving Castle," Howl's Moving Castle
","I'm not a good fan of anime. Like the fantasy, the background, but don't like too much the style of characters. Miyazaki is one of the best of genre, so it's difficult not to like this movie.Sophie is an ordinary teen with no self steam. Meets Howl, the hero, the wizard, the handsome man. Jealous, a witch turns Sophie to an old lady. The story continues through magic kingdoms, goddess, demons and wars.Like a fairy tale, Miyazaki criticizes war, jealousy, vanity, but storyboard could be better. Animation is great, with a huge living castle moving thousand parts at the same time. Kind of bizarre, but really good.Humor is everywhere. Isolated and adult, but the best comes with Calcifer, a simple demon. The fire of the castle. Simple, but funny.Worthy, even if you're not an anime addict.",7,2,5,1 September 2005

","Was prepared to loose my money with another awful Armageddon. Surprise. I got involved with it. Good story, with good beginning.Ewan McGregor is pretty fine, like aways, but it's just like if Michael Bay left all the actors with their stereotyped actions. Could forget a bit the action and waste some time with personal interactions. In the other way, George Lucas does it very well.OK, the screenplay is terrible, with poor dialogs and Scarlet Johansson could be better directed, just like she did in 'Lost In Translation'.Lots of explosion in last half. Don't think Michael Bay would forget them. Some special effects and too much superman action. Not a special movie, but even not completely trash.",5,2,3,22 August 2005
