Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Pathetic
","I'd read a series of reviews that claimed that this was the funniest film ever. I'd heard stories of people collapsing their lungs laughing in the cinema. The blurb on the front cover from magazines I respect told me to expect a laugh riot. I'm wondering how any of these stories happened - this film is a pathetic childish mess.There were three scenes I enjoyed in this film - the rodeo scene, the camper van scene (both exposed ignorance, which is what the film should have concentrated on), and the kidnapping scene at the end (very funny). However, in between these good moments, we are subjected to sub-Farrelly humour. Naked wrestling around a hotel? Hilarious. An endless series of jokes on masturbation? My sides, they're splitting. Carrying your faeces into a dinner party? And so on. I understand that the point of the film was to highlight ignorance, racism and fear of foreigners. Why the film felt it necessary to embarrass a dinner party but carrying a bag of faeces to the table and invite a prostitute to the table, I will never know. I get a feeling I don't want to.As with Ali G, Baran Cohen has proved that he cannot carry a character for more than 5 minutes. I'm hoping this will see the end of him and his 'wacky' characters, but experience and a sizable box office makes this unlikely. Please avoid this dismal rubbish.",3,4,8,10 November 2007
The Day After Tomorrow," Stupid fun
","Of course I wasn't expecting a masterpiece. You'd be stupid to do so. What I was expecting was a fun and entertaining way to kill two hours. And it definately delivered on that front. From the 'finding nemo' style story to the fantastic effects, this film was... fun. Too often in recent films, we've had too much plot development in films that we don't go to for the plot. And whilst there is a hint of plot in this, you get the impression that plot was the last thing on the directors mind. Instead it was more a case of 'Hello America, meet destruction!' The film is better for that. Sure, it's not Shakespeare but it's a good laugh.",6,0,0,2 June 2004
The Matrix Revolutions," Praise be!
","As I begin to write this, I notice that 4'277 IMDB users have rated this film 10/10. I fail to imagine why and blame the use of hallucinagenic drugs. This film is terrible. I say 'Praise be!' in the summary because it is over.This film shows how terrible a trilogy can go. Granted it should not take all the blame, Reloaded was also dire. Two crimes against cinema, especially considering that 'The Matrix' was one of the best more imaginative films of recent years. Why was this? - Interesting premise - Characters we cared about - Fantastic plot twists - Visually stunning techniques that had not been seen before Had the sequels delivered these then the series would have worked. But no. Interesting premise? Somewhat, but made too complicated with needlessly added philosophy. A better premise would've been the hunt for Zion rather than trying to defend it against poorly animated machines. Characters we care about? No. Morpheous became a parody of his former self. Neo and Trinity became irritating, due to bad acting. Several other minor characters came into the fold with no plot development or decent storylines. Why everyone keeps going on about Monica Bellucia I don't know, she was only in it for 5 minutes. Plot twists? Meet an incredibly linear storyline. Stupidly, the chance for such a twist (a matrix with in a matrix - dodgy but doable, and redeemable) was passed over with nary a mention. Visually stunning techniques? No. A brief kung fu scene in reloaded that was inferior in every way to the original, and then several fights made with incredibly bad CGI, made worse by the release of Kill Bill and the House of Blue Leaves. What do we have? In fairness, there were some good set pieces. The mech scene was interesting and kept my interest for a bit, but it went on for far too long. The final fight scene between Neo and Smith wasn't bad in visual terms. Not great but not bad. However, it went on far too long as well. They fly apart, they crash together. They fly apart, they crash together. The visuals get wasted, the scene is boring, my bum hurt and I was waiting to get out of the cinema.A wasted premise. 2.5/10",3,0,0,1 April 2004
The Orphanage," Beautiful & Terrifying
","Part of what some are describing as a new wave of Spanish Horror (as influenced by last years superb Pans Labyrinth), The Orphanage sees director Juan Antonio Bayona take over duties from Guillermo del Toro, who is wearing the producers hat this time round. The result sees one of the most beautifully filmed and yet utterly terrifying films to grace the cinema screens in recent years.The plot concerns a woman called Laura, who has bought the orphanage she grew up in, intending to reopen it as a special school. She has moved in with her husband and son, who soon begins to open some of the mysteries of the past...To go in to any further detail would do this film a disservice. This film has been lovingly shot and edited in the style of old ghost stories. What scares there are - and believe me there are some - are shown with subtlety and atmosphere, which makes it all the more terrifying when they happens. The atmosphere is tense and creepy throughout - a far cry from other recent horror films, and all the better for it.The film echoes Pans Labyrinth in terms of style and (in a loose sense) plot. Del Toro may have been producer, but you can see his handywork on screen. However, this is not a bad thing, and Bayona should have a good career ahead of him. A strong (and gut-wrenching) ending ties the film up nicely, and the film will remain with you for a good long while after you leave the cinema.10/10",10,4,7,30 March 2008
Quantum of Solace," Nice fights, shame about the plot.
","I'm writing this as a long time lover of the Bond series. Despite my skepticism about the reboot concept, I thoroughly enjoyed Casino Royale. Unfortunately, QoS does not live up to it's predecessor, although it is far from being a bad film.A smart and fast-paced opening starts the film well, setting the action shortly after the events of Casino Royale. Bond is out for revenge, and this is reflected in some very brutal action scenes, which surely push the 12A rating imposed by the BBFC. Hints are dropped about mysterious groups, which will surely become a plot point in future films.Unfortunately, this seems to be the only point behind QoS. The plot involves a lot of political squabbling over the treatment of third world countries that frankly feels like it has been written by a Year 12 Marxist sociology student. Whilst Mathieu Amalric provides a suitably slimy villain, you feel that the role is wasted. The shadowy Quantum feels like a sub-par Spectre, and we can only hope their role will be beefed up in future films.However, it's not all bad. Fight scenes are excellently choreographed, and there are some touching scenes between Bond and Camille. The series continues to go darker, and we can hope that this future films will be better executed than this effort.Worth a watch, but it could have been handled so much better.",6,7,13,31 October 2008
Alien vs. Predator," So-so (beware, spoilers)
","I went into this film with magazine reviews racing round in my mind. Not that good, they said. For obsessive fans of the originals and teenagers only, they said. Personally, I ignore such reviews. They are often done by serious minded critics, and films like these are not for serious minded people. They are for people who want light entertainment. I stand by my theory, though AvP did test my faith. It's not a bad film, but not particularly good either. I was disappointed by it. The previous Alien films (yes, even resurrection) were, in my opinion, good films. Aliens is one of my favourites of all time. They are very well written, and all follow a simple formula. They have a small group of people who are thrown in an unescapable situation, and get picked off one by one. The same applies to predator. And this means the characters have to be strong. However, AvP deviates from this formula. The characters are irrelevant, given second place to the carnage. Often one-dimensional, we don't even know most of their names. A short film already, ten-fifteen minutes back story would have been useful. A previous history between Lex and Weyland would have been wonderful. Whilst we're on the subject, Weyland was a completely wasted character. The founder of one of the most powerful companies on earth, the prototype for the Bishop droid, and not a word on his history. Inexcuseable. And killing almost all of them off in a very short space of time is a waste. Far better to kill 3 or 4 off at one point and then to kill them one at a time. However, it's not all bad. The fight scenes are fantastic and seeing the alien and the predators fight still thrills me. But like the rest of the film, the fight scenes are far too short. The aliens fail to convey the same menace as they have done in previous films (despite the fact that this is the first alien film i've seen on the cinema screen). The characters are a lot prettier than in prior films though, Anderson has done a nice job of remodelling them. It's a pity that during kills, we have to flick back and forth, in order to get a small rating. Overall, not a bad film. The fight scenes make up for the lack of characters and the pyramid is a nice touch. But (and please take note of this for the sequel fox), we desperately need some better developed characters. We want to care when they die! We want to feel what they're going through! That's why we go to films. Giving a character a couple of kids isn't enough.Lazy. 6/10",6,1,2,21 October 2004
Saw," The film of 2004
","I am not an easy person to please when it comes to films. I am picky, I gripe at minor points, I'll happily rant about something for hours. So it was an incredibly nice surprise to see this low budget shocker. Having gone to the cinema on a whim, I had the choice between this or Resident Evil 2. I stand by my choice. The acting, whilst a bit shaky, seemed to fit the mood of the film. The story was inventive, the bad guy the most interesting movie villain since Se7ens murderer. In fact, probably more interesting. The camera work was amazing, using fantastic techniques to highlight panic, and the film was filled with enough misdirection to keep me guessing throughout. And then we get to the ending. Wow. I'm not sure I've seen a better ending. As I was walking to the cinema, I was even moaning about conclusions in recent films, and how difficult it is to end a story in a satisfactory manner. But then having seen this, my faith is final acts has been restored. As the credits rolled in the cinema, I was sitting there, open-mouthed, trying to comprehend what I had just seen. It took me most of the walk home, it was that good. Put simply, this is easily the best film made this year. And to not see it is an act of masochism. 10/10",9,0,0,18 October 2004
