The Rock," Insufferable, but hilarious.
","There are some terrible acting moments from Cage and Connery here that are as entertaining as a strong Brando moment, so the terrible script can be ignored for the entertainment value.The direction sucks, the acting is worse, but it's worth a watch for those who love schlock. A fun drinking game is to take a shot every time there's a cringe. You'll be drunk in 20 minutes.",5,2,3,27 October 2019
The Mummy," A childhood favorite, a reason I love movies
","I'm a snobby movie watcher. Most of my favorite movies are not in English, or are horror movies. I'm the type of person who watches 2-4 movies a day (my therapist and I think it might be time to trim that down, ya dig?). So when I say I love the Mummy, you can rest assured that my taste does not include QT, Nolan, Cameron, etc, but it does include the Mummy with Brenden Frazier. I've seen the movie 1,000 times since I was 9. The original is a masterwork of monster horror, something that helped inspire Psycho, invasion of the body snatchers, and the Gojira series.The remake has merit only as much as a Nick Cage movie does as an adult, which amounts to something that can only be art. The hammy performances, 8th grade writing project script and Pg-13 jump scares are so bad they are funny. This is a movie that gets exciting, and then your realize you're caught up in something that you shouldn't like.This movie is like a trip to McDonald's. You can deny that you like it, or that you even had the experience, but deep down, you know a dopamine rush when it happens. And you want more.",Null,0,0,21 January 2020

Dog Day Afternoon," American Realism for 2020
","This film struck me with lightning after viewing it for the first time in 2020. I assume it had the same impact on me that it did upon release for audiences at the time.This film challenged me, and made me ask questions that most movies have not:1. Why did every cop in Brooklyn show up armed and dressed to kill to a small potatoes bank robbery worth less than $1500?2. Why did Sonny not run when the riot he caused distracted everyone, from rioter to pig, to media camera people?3. Why did Attica happen? Did it cause the overreaction on this hot August afternoon?4. Why did the hostages stick around? Was it because they wanted attention, to get their '15 minutes?'Draw your own conclusions, you can infer from my sneaky premises above and below how I feel.Dog Day afternoon is the 7th best film I've ever seen, only behind master works of Melville, Kobayashi, Antonioni, and Hitchcock.If you are less than 30 in 2020, and were a young person during the Ferguson incidents in the early millennials, you'll be brought to tears in watching this, as I was.A truly relatable film for anyone who has lived in poverty as well.A line to leave you with:
'That guy (cop) there wants to kill me (Sonny) so bad he can taste it!'",9,0,0,18 January 2020
It's a Wonderful Life," ...or is it? 2019
","This film is deeper than it may seem and so much more depressing and dark than generations seem to have caught on to.Jimmy Stewart does not end up with A 'wonderful life.' He owes money, gets upset, disowns his kids, gets some 'help' from a plot device Angel, and then is told to suck it with a smile after being shown a thinly veiled sociological interdependency argument. Otherwise, the film tells us that if you have friends and family, you're rich, and not being around has ripple effects on everyone.Capra is actually showing us that we are all owned and force fed religious and hyper optimistic ideals, so that the rich and war profiteers can own cities at a time.What a wonderful life.",Null,2,2,11 December 2019
There Will Be Blood," A Goddamned, Hell of a Show
","The film crawls open with Johnny Greenwood's ominous score , and then never lets up. 'There Will Be Blood,' brutally exposes the hypocrisies of business and religion, and how their goals are not much different. The film follows Daniel Plainview and his interactions in Southern California that lead to him drilling oil in a small town. The most interesting elements of the film are the interplay between Dano and Day Lewis, and Plainview's relationship with his son. On one hand, we have a ruthless, misanthropic, oil tycoon who wants to drink the town's 'milkshake.' On the other we have a young, charismatic, aspiring evangelist who wants to take advantage of his town's guest, extorting him for money to build a new church. The oil tycoon wants nothing to do with anyone in the town, he just wants the oil. The priest just wants glory. Their conflict resolution is unexpected, but gratifying. The character study of Daniel Plainview shows a man who gains power and influence, while simultaneously losing all patience for anyone else who he perceives as a threat or competitor. Plainview's character arc literally starts with him rescuing a baby, and ends with him....well..'There Will Be Blood' is the 2nd best film that I have ever seen. The musical score, the acting from Daniel Day Lewis, the screenwriting and honesty from PTA, and cinematography make this film more than just a good character study, it's an instant classic.",8,0,0,3 July 2018
Raging Bull," A Masculine Messy, Bloody, Mirror
","Initially, this film did not resonate. I wasn't sure what Lamotta was supposed to mean to me. He was hard to relate to. Yet something I live by when it comes to just about anything is that you should always try something twice. So I did.Raging Bull is one of my favorite American films after several viewings because it truly portrays unbridled masculinity. It's not pretty. It's not morally justifiable. It's just animalistic. The constant drive to wanna be the best, to conquer the competition, to dominate women, all of these things are ugly, but American and masculine. We see a man that never rises, but continues to slowly fall. The fact that he is a good fighter, and that he wins the belt, means nothing because he gets really fat and loses his brothers love. His body and dominance start to leave him as he achieves. The trade-offs and high stakes resonate in waves.One of the most stunning sequences in cinema history for me is when we see Lamotta at arguably his lowest, in prison. The scene evokes true emotion, as we see a man who has never broken, finally break. He realizes what he is. Who he is. And I cry every time. Not because I love Jake Lamotta, but because I understand what it is like to regret something that is in your nature. You're sorry, but you're not. But you are because you were caught.Lamotta cannot understand why people start to turn on him, despite his treatment of them. This is personified in the final scene with Joey. His ego never leaves. The constant need for attention and justification becomes Jake's fight. He can't physically dominate people anymore, so he has to use his fragile ego to manipulate people into laughter at his self deprecation.And so what does it all mean? Is raging bull a technically excellent film? Of course. Is it well directed. Sure. But what it truly is is a mirror. A mirror that men hold up, and see themselves in, like it or not. I certainly did. And that's entertainment.",9,2,2,8 February 2020
Aladdin," Even better as an adult
",Funny. Memorable animation. Robin Williams in top form. Stay away from the rehashed nostalgia-inspired live action horror show of 2019. The OG rings true.,9,4,5,16 November 2019
The Birds," A comedy, for the right person
","Or maybe the wrong person. All that I know is that there are several scenes that had me rollin fam. These birds attacking kids, mostly ginger kids, is a comedic masterpiece. Hitchcock's obsession with San Fran provides some excellent cinematography, and there's snappy dialogue as always. I recommend for anyone who wants to have a good time, maybe Zoot up to enhance your experience.",9,2,2,19 May 2019
