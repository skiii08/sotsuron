Ford v Ferrari," A gorgeous funny movie, with some nitpicking moments
","I thought this movie was a really great movie. This is so different than all the movies coming out this year. The cars look and sound SO AWESOME. The acting is amazing I loved everyone one in the movie. There weren't any cringe worthy moments which I despise in movies. There were no CGI if I can recall in this movie, which means, everything in this movie was real. And honestly that exactly how it looked. I gave it an 8 and not a 9 or a 10 only because I feel like they could have given us more information about the main characters in the movie. I wasn't really sure why Christian bale and Matt Damon's character loves to race. We can clearly see that they do I just didn't really know why. But if you look over that stuff and focus on the great energy coming from everyone in the movie, then I know you will enjoy yourself",8,1,5,16 November 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Did something no other marvel movie has ever done..... and they absolutely KILLED it!! BEST MARVEL MOVIE EVER MADE!!
","I have waited for so many years for these amazing marvel characters to finally work together and kick some ass. Every single fight scene was pure perfection. I was just filled with so much happiness watching these superheroes fight together. You really can't ask for anything else. FINALLY marvel has made a villain on the big screen that is actually good. Thanos is one of my favorite villains after heath ledgers joker. You see exactly just how powerful he is and crazy he is. They also bring out his emotion side for a brief minute which is something I never saw coming. He is just amazing. And the comedy!! I would give the comedy a 10. You can tell that they aren't just jokes they added in at the last minute just to add it. Seeing Tom Holland being so happy just to be there was so good you can just tell how happy he is. He and tony stark are still like father and son, and they work so well together. All the characters get enough time in the movie so they don't just feel like they were put there just because they can and it'll make them money. I will worn you however, the ending will either make you hate it and infuriate you or you'll understand just why the Russo brothers did this. You might have to take a day to process what just happened but if you understand that the ending isn't a bad thing but kind of a work of art. I give a nine because of the ending and because there are those moments when they just feel a little long and you want to see thanos punch someone in the face but they really didn't bother me that much. So, in conclusion, this is my all time favorite marvel movie and I'm gonna see it like another 4 times at least while still in theaters. I'm still just amazed on how phenomenal this movie was and that we finally get the cross over we deserve and that it is definitely not a giant flop like justice league was. AWESOME movie.",9,1,3,27 April 2018
