It," Brilliant
","We just got back from seeing this and I don't know what people are complaining about, we found it a great retelling of the master of horror's novel. Understandably the story has been cut in half for the films, and it'll be nice to see the next part if it's just as well done. I found the storytelling tight and the effects were very disturbing, which I loved a lot, I actually jumped a few times and I'm not easy to scare! Okay so it may not appeal to everyone, that's fine but be fair, it's very well done, and I liked it.",10,6,16,8 September 2017
Hereditary," Waste of time
","Didn't make any sense and was totally not scary or entertaining, 1 star is already too generous for this rubbish!",1,0,1,1 September 2018
Captain Marvel," Pretty good
","I went in not expecting much but it's actually pretty good, likeable characters and even a cute'n deadly furball!",9,1,10,3 June 2019
The Lion King," Life and death
","The cgi effects are really good in this version but the voices and action are dead as hell....lifeless retell of the original funny and moving story, so just see that one and avoid this one.",2,2,5,25 December 2019
Coco," Beautiful movie
","I spotted Coco while browsing and tbh I didn't expect it to be so good, it stole my heart with its dia de muertos characters and heartfelt warmth of family, struggle for your dreams and the coming together of the two, while staying true to Mexican culture and tradition (of which I respect) it'll make you cry and if you don't cry then you're a stone cold-hearted critter :P",10,1,1,22 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," What the..?
","Okay first I'm not a huge SW fan, I like them enough, but this one has me perplexed, to quote a famous (and fabulous) movie line 'how many different ways do you want me to tell the same story?' Which is what is sadly going on here, with each new movie the fans are being subjected to the same old same old and nothing new....indeed degenerating story arcs...at this point I'm glad to not be that great of a fan, because I would be totally devastated as are many of the people out there suffering this travesty.",1,19,26,22 April 2018
Midsommar," What the actual....
",This movie is super screwed up and beyond boring! Avoid this unless you're as high as the whole bunch of people who made this piece of crap.,1,7,12,24 February 2020
Joker," Slow paced but..
","I liked the acting but the story was slow and took a while to progress, it feels more like an art movie version of the joker than the traditional depictions of the character.",9,4,7,1 January 2020
The Purge," Yep this is american
","Boring, lacklustre, insane and worthless movie. Seems to just want to fill a desire for murder and nothing more. Sad.",1,0,0,5 April 2020
