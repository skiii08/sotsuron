The Expendables 2," Pure, Escapist Fun
","A fun, frenetic and over the top story regarding the saving of the world by attempting to obtain back from the villain (Van Damme) some plutonium, this is mindless, weapons at the ready filmmaking at its most potent. More or less the group from the first Expendables is back, along with Nan Yu as Maggie, a more beefed up role for Bruce Willis and Arnold, and a very welcome Chuck Norris who, at 72, looks better than some of the guys years younger than him. Full of in jokes (a few hilarious) and fast paced violence (somewhat of the comic book variety, but the body count is very large), along with a by the numbers plot, this is an 80's action hero fan's dream. No need to get into the plot, just know its check your brains at the door fun. Its best to watch it in the theater, as it feels larger than life at times. Kudos to Stallone, who in films over the last six or so years (Rocky Balboa, Rambo, Expendables 1) has shone he understands what his strengths are. Recommended, and don't worry about the violence.",8,1,4,1 September 2012
Au Revoir les Enfants," A Near Great Film
","The thing that struck me first about this was the uniformly great acting. Obstensibly about a group of boys who are sent away from Paris during World War 2 due to the occupation of the Nazis, you get a feel for all the things that mattered to them. You feel the bitterness and anger they feel about being shepherded off away from their families. The main story is about Jean & Julien, two different kids whose paths cross. It is found out during the film that Jean is Jewish, and you can imagine, given that time in history, all the things that went through the boys' minds. Louis Malle has crafted a film that not only tells a good story, but is shot in intriguing colors. The story has a lot of heart and is highly recommended.",9,1,2,8 March 2008
The Expendables," Brutal, Escapist Fun
","This is a mostly fast paced, lively action film starring Sylvester Stallone as Barney, who leads a group of mercenaries of the movie title. Mostly, this film is about them being hired by the CIA to kill General Garces, the military dictator of the island of Vilena. However, the general is controlled by a rogue CIA agent, played by Eric Roberts, and the Expendables eventually go there to liberate the island and the general's daughter Sandra. There are cameos in the film, including a scene with Stallone, Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger, wherein the movie's best one liner is delivered (watch for it). Also part of the film is Mickey Rourke, the owner of the tattoo parlor where the group meet to discuss their next jobs. Some people have spoken of how little we see Arnold and Bruce, and that there is no scene together with Rourke and Roberts (remember 'The Pope Of Greenwich Village'?), but these criticisms are not valid. The movie is about the Expendables, and that is the correct focus of the film. The movie is excessively violent at times, but that is expected. Watch this film on a big screen, there are a few moments that will blow you away (literally). I like the direction by Sly, its tight and focused on the action. It correctly makes the mayhem seem edgy and purposeful. This is for action lovers, not for the faint of heart. It is especially recommended for anyone who grew up on those great 80's action films. Its a bit nostalgic for that reason. Welcome back to the genre.",8,3,14,14 August 2010
Mamma Mia!," You Know What? Its Good.
","I didn't expect much so I was happy watching this film. There isn't much of a story here, a young lady named Sophie is getting married and she invites three men that dated her mom in and around the same time, one of whom is her father. This would fall flat as a drama but as a musical with those infectious ABBA songs, it becomes fun to watch. Meryl Streep is fine as Donna, Sophie's mom and she sings reasonably well. I would suggest turning up the movie a bit louder and immerse yourself in it. The supporting players, including Colin Firth, Pierce Brosnan, Christine Baranski and Julie Walters, are all part of the fun. Not much to think about, but that makes it a better film. So, enjoy, its worth watching.",8,1,1,22 July 2009
Revolutionary Road," Absorbing, But Depressing
","There is no denying the chemistry that exists between Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. As a suburban married couple in Long Island in the 40's, you are immediately a voyeur in their life. The emotions in this film run the gamut. You have to give Winslet & DiCaprio credit for not going the total commercial route. The film is bathed in soft colors and the direction is top notch. That being said, this is not necessarily a happy story. Anyone who watched 'Titanic' and feels they are going to replay that film will be disappointed. Ms. Winslet deserves the accolades she received for her portrayal, she is wonderful. Watch this film to see two A list actors work magic. Although it is depressing, it is worthwhile.",8,1,1,30 December 2009
Lincoln," Goodbsorbim
","There is no question of the extraordinary portrayal of the title character by Daniel Day-Lewis. It is forceful, nuanced and absorbing. He is truly a great actor. The misgivings I have are the telling of the story, which kind of veers toward political correctness. Besides Mr. Day-Lewis, most of the other roles are underwritten. Tommy Lee Jones has shown himself to be time and again a wonderful actor, but he is not in this film enough for us to consider his role in the passing of the 13th Amendment. Sally Field, as Mary Todd Lincoln,barely needs to be in this. The film wants to please everyone, which is fine, but it reaches too far. It is at times way too much talk. However, watching Daniel Day-Louis is worth the price of admission. So, a little conflicted but recommended.",7,1,4,24 November 2012
Crazy Heart," Decent Film, Great Jeff Bridges
","Its not hard to understand why Jeff Bridges won awards for his role in this film. The story of a hard drinking and living country singer is ordinary in its execution, but Bridges gives the character an edgy, unflinching portrayal which resonates through the film. Maggie Gyllenhall is okay, Robert Duvall is (of course) better, but the real reason to see this film is Bridges. This is not a whole life telling story, it starts in the middle, which is just as well. Jeff Bridges is a good singer, the songs are good. It was Jeff's time to win an award and he deserved it. So, fairly ordinary story made better by Jess Bridges. Watch it for that reason alone.",7,1,1,25 November 2010
RED," A Very Good, Wild Ride
","A sometimes exciting escapist film about retired CIA agents who are being targeted for a mission they were involved in in 1981 in Guatemala, this film stars Bruce Willis as Frank Moses, seemingly a quiet guy living in suburban Cleveland. He strikes up a phone friendship with Sarah (Mary Louise Parker) and he finds out he is a target. Eventually they go to New Orleans where they see Joe (Morgan Freeman, somewhat underused but still solid) and the slightly deranged Marvin (the always great John Malkovich). Essentially, they are hunting down the people who are trying to kill them. No need to go into any further detail except to mention Helen Mirren's also small but pivotal role, this film is a lot of fun. It has violence of course, but it held my interest throughout. I'm giving it a nine because of its entertainment value. It should have been a bigger hit.",Null,2,2,8 October 2011
Slumdog Millionaire," Experience Is Everything..But
","Having read about all the critics falling over themselves praising this film, I thought I would be greatly entertained. I was, but only mildly. The story of a contestant on 'Millionaire' whose knowledge all stems from experiences in his life is a great idea, but by the end of the film I just did not care enough about him to see whether he would take the prize or not. I don't think Jamal's character is particularly sympathetic or likable enough for me to be behind him. The relationship with Latika was, to me, not explored all that well. I was in a theater with a fairly sizable audience and no one laughed. I shrugged my shoulders throughout. Well made as it is, it just didn't matter to me what happened to Jamal. Thats unfortunate. Thats why I recommend the film as a film that has merit in its execution but little merit in its characters. I wouldn't want to know anyone in this film. Thats why I didn't love it, only kind of liked it.",5,7,15,14 December 2008
