Iron Man 3," Mediocre at best.
","IMO this wasn't really a movie so much as a vehicle for executive greed trying to capitalize on Avengers success.Just seemed like a whole bunch of random situations/ideas crammed in so the film can make big bucks opening overseas and advertising for the next Disney/Marvel movies. Don't even ask about the Mandarin. Not enough room for the problems there.Poorly plotted action sequences,lot's of forced jokes,re used cg, anti climactic, and generally lost trying to figure out what it wants to be. Faverau dodged a bullet here imo. Really hoping Black was rolled over by non-creatives pulling the strings as I had higher hopes for him. Not to mention the amount of artist work that was done and then completely ignored by bumping artists off the credit list amongst other wrongs. Sad that movies spending hundreds of millions of dollars fail due to ego and greed. Hey,at least the upper crust can get a new supercar with the cash they made though. Hopefully DC will repair this void with Man of Steel.",4,4,9,6 May 2013
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," You're always hated at the top.
","OK, I'm hearing comments like 'What happened to the story?',you mean the story that has always been about ROBOTS IN DISGUISE? I'm sorry, I thought that was EXACTLY what the movie was about!? Were you the gremlin behind me in Godzilla going,'yeah,that 200ft Lizard is unrealistic man, he should have been more of a Raptor.' Some other comment gems I found: 'The Animation hadn't improved since the first one.' Well, I think a little research is necessary. http://www.cinefex.com/ and MANY other sources. The forest scene alone should make you feel shame for saying that. Some other highly intelligent comments ( insert sarcasm here )'This is a terrible film by ANY standard.' 'cinematography was poor.'This person = FAIL. Do you believe 'Documentary Style' camera shake for no reason that appears on soo many Oscar contenders is cinematography? If so,it's time for you to have a nap.. a long one. 'Robots look alike.' The ugliest robot design I have EVER seen, The (animators)should've gone with something resembling the original designs from the 80s cartoon.' HAHA,laughable.Clearly a Visual effects wizard and an expert in production who could do all this alone,and wouldn't need the 'Animators' to design the robots. Since animating big chunky robots would be impossible, and animators don't design on production,you are wrong and fail.. on sooo many levels.. :) Better to be thought a fool dude. By the way, the designs were bad ass. Well, I have to say, I would love to stop hearing about everybody's whining issues with this movie,and start hearing some positives,but I'm sure everybody will be mad at it for being 'too awesome' for awhile. So what Iwill say is,you have to realize how many people out there kill themselves on a daily basis to bring you films at all.It's not all big money for all the crews out there.I DO think this movie deserves AT LEAST a nom for the Oscar in more than a couple categories. To everybody who hates this film and Michael Bay: Let's see YOUR movie. I can't wait to tear it apart.. Oh no wait,, you just talk the talk.. Transformers(both)were AWESOME!!!Congrats on a great job to the prod crew and to all the artists. To who said 'Too many Robots' ' Too many explosions' ..really!!??? Who ARE you? Can you HAVE too many robots? Is it possible? Do you hate bunnies? I'm off to dream about TF3. I CAN'T WAIT for MICHAEL BAY to make another one,and how awesome it will be if it's done with massive Bayhem!(With MORE robots and explosions of course.:)Enjoy yelling at me when I'm gone,but I will probably just be out having fun with a GIRL.Or doing digital effects so I can help people like Michael Bay make more awesome films! So you it won't effect me. :) Stay Hungry, and Shoot for the edit! :)Seriously,I hope you can see this for what it is,the way you SHOULD have seen TF.",10,26,49,18 February 2010
