The Ring," Uh...Confusiing
","I don't understand all the hype over this movie.  I kept waiting for something really cool to happen, or at least, something that connected all the symbolism that runs rampant in this picture.  Neither ever happens. This film is god awful, and if I truly thought I could get more out of it, I would gladly watch it again.  But, I know it would only be a waste of 2 hours of my life...again.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this trash.",3,0,1,6 July 2003
Stripes," A Classic!
","Stripes is one of those movies you can watch over and over and over again. It is a comedy classic.  I was about 12 or 13 when I first watched it and had a blast repeating the film's dialogue with friends.  The scene where all the guys are in the room telling each other the reasons why they joined the army is magnificent.  Bill Murray is incredible in this movie, as is Harold Ramis.  They are supported nicely by John Candy, Judge Reinhold, Warren Oates and Conrad Dunn.  I would love for a film maker to try to make an updated version of sorts...I think some have tried with Pauly Shore's 'In the Army Now' and other such flops, that simply, do not come close to 'Stripes.'  And...please...I hope a commemorative DVD with rare interviews and deleted scenes, etc. hits the market.  Stripes is military humor at its best!!!",10,0,0,6 July 2003
The Transporter," BMW Chase Scenes and Martial Arts!
","While The Transporter may not be the most provocative action thriller to some, it packs an amazing punch based on two of its action themes that I truly love: intense driving sequences of the ultimate driving machine BMW, and superb martial arts correagraphy.  Statham is an up-and-comer with great screen presence and I also hope to see more of Qi Shu in American films. Although the story line could have been more polished, the illegal smuggling of Chinese was an interesting twist and I would enjoy a movie that delves deeper into this all-too horrific reality.  The two main characters, Frank and Lai, and their relationship is something that left me wanting more.  I would love to see a sequel, perhaps Frank can set up his transporting business state side with Lai helping him out.  I really liked this film...bring back the BMWs and the martial arts, and I'll buy a ticket for Transporter 2.",9,0,0,4 November 2003
