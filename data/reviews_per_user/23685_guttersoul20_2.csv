Requiem for a Dream," one MASTERPIECE of life
","cant believe i hadn't seen this movie for along...the title of film is very expressing about the things goes inside It may be related more to the American life and all of its problems...but as Egyptian i see this film pass beyond the limits of its scenes talking about human dream,human failure and weakness , about life it self and all its Ups and downs it may be so cruel of the writers to end the film like that but what we can say.. the real life is so cruel also but for the first time in my life....i need to cry after American movie...i cry for my failure for the evils in world for the mother for the drugs and for a DREAM",9,3,6,28 June 2007
Salt," holes!!!
",good action flick indeed ..... but seriously guys there's many odd things1- how come they don't have satellite surveillance when Salt escaped the petroleum company building and just vanished like it's kind of magic2- just before death of the Russian president .. where were all the secret service agents And Russian agent who would rush to protect him at any small sign of danger as when the organ started to play erratically3- main suspect of presidential killing to be transported by one SUV and two Chevy ..... can you believe it guys? and during the tow or three minutes of crash no mere agent appeared !!! and she eventually walks away like nothing has happened4-how the hell did she managed to reach the bunker 8 stores below .... we're talking here about the president safety plan not some homo CEO,5,0,2,17 September 2010
