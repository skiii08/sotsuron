The Blair Witch Project," Sweet Lord, that movie'll poke someone's eye out!
","Never for a moment do they stop to let you remember that you're watching a movie.  Suspension of disbelief isn't necessary...  this movie is relentlessly real.Other commentaries explain the movie, so I'll say simply that it was a beautiful piece of film making, and it scared the snot out of me.  I literally couldn't sleep that night.Also, I think that it deserves mentioning that its depiction of Maryland is absolutely dead-on accurate.  I've lived here for close to twenty years now, and I've met people and seen places like those in the movie.   They did that very well.",10,1,2,4 May 1999
