3:10 to Yuma," Not your old bust'em up shoot'em up
","I went to go see this movie last weekend with low expectations based on the preview trailers that I had seen. For a western type movie it seemed to follow your basic western plot. The bad guys against the good guys.One of the things that made this movie different was the character development. As the movie goes on you really start to gain an understanding of the history and mentality of each character. This is a key part of the movie because you start to question where everyone is going and what everyone will do.As a villain, Russell Crowe is outstanding. His character alone guides this film to a brilliant ending you may not expect.",8,1,2,10 September 2007
