The Perks of Being a Wallflower," A emotional heart string pulling story
","I watched this from finding a trailer of it online and i did hear of it years ago but wasn't sure. A lot has happen since then and when i watched it i was mesmerised through the whole film. Near the end i was crying as i could related so much with Charlie due to the amount of struggles i have had with my feeling and the horrible incident that happened to me when i was twelve.I was crying near the end, i was crying as i knew he was feeling just the same how i was when i was going through a bad time. I still am and this film help release some of those emotions.",10,1,2,21 July 2017
