The Avengers," Dumbed down irrelevant nonsense
","Honestly, I like the odd superhero movie but the makers of this are like the fat kid in Willy The Wonka who has to have all the chocolate. This production (sic) treats the entire audience as low IQ zombies (no offence to actual zombies intended). There is zero depth of character development and zero story line interest. At no time whatsoever do you ever feel a sense of suspense or danger. At no time do you care if any of the characters come to harm - well you kind of know that none of them will as their superheroes - obviously. And why even bother having humans with no super powers - Oh I forgot, the humans in it are the most magical, unbelievable fighting machines. They just stand there wasting anything in their path, and Im not talking about the super heroes here. Rambo is but a beginner compared to them.Every single facet of this farce is totally predictable from start to finish. Its one of those where you pray your transported to another reality and the bad guys actually win.Technically its all good except the sound department have again gone mental. The action scenes are incredibly loud and were at times quite painful on the ears (seriously) and then the speaking parts were often so whispered and muffled sounding. I'm sure during post the sound guys sit there with the best sound system money can buy - but the reality is their mix doesn't translate well across systems. Bad sound isn't the problem, its the post mixing. I hear this issue on far to many movies these days and its ruining many films.The acting by some of the cast is decent, considering the ridiculously poor script they have to work with. But in no way will any of them be remembering their part in this movie during their twilight years. This is a money and profile job - nothing more. Even then I do have to wonder if putting your name to this is actually worth it?. The directing is amateur hour. His/her (I don't know and don't care) focus is squarely on action and FX - so why not just have the FX team direct it as they certainly would have done a better job than the lucky ducky who managed to land this lucrative job. I do wonder if the director has actually ever watched a movie to see how one directs actors?Anyway, I cant say much more about this nonsense except if you enjoy a movie which is one long mind numbing boring action scene, aimed at a dumbed down populace - then this is for you.PS I cannot believe this movie gained so much favourable reviews. I certainly smell a rat.",2,33,68,27 January 2013
Superbad," I liked it
","Actually this one stands out from the crowd. As a 40 year old I found my self laughing quite a bit and I must be honest and say I don't know what age group this was aimed at because the script seemed to be something that could appeal to anyone from the age of 12 to 60. Some of the jokes have a shock value but they are funny never the less. It has the geek will probably prevails element but there was no sign of the usual High School Addonis character who usually gets his come up-pence at the end of the movie which was refreshing. If this film was made in the UK it would be filled with Political correctness and over bearing in your face multiculturalism mixed with lame jokes aimed at 12 year olds by a director and scriptwriting team who would assume the audience are thick. Quite simply Britain couldn't make this kind of movie without completely messing it up.I liked all the characters from the main geeks, the cops and the would be girlfriends. No one was annoying.While the storyline is semi predictable the intelligent script makes it something I would certainly recommend if your in need of a laugh.",7,0,3,27 April 2008
2012," It was the PC undertones I didn't like
","Great thrilling disaster film, no doubt about that.But for me (as I expected) it was the overbearing leftists and PC undertones all the way through the film. Their not serious or even obvious but they are there. All black and Asian characters were portrayed as noble and righteous along with the women and the kids. Not so for the white male characters. An assortment of selfish no gooders, crazies, greedy Russian oligarths, and failed writers and fathers. The majority of the audience would never notice it, but those like me who see politics in almost everything (which is fact) will spot it instantly. I just wish mainstream film makers would quite the self loathing stance because its rampant in the mainstream. Just a bit of balance would have been nice.Still, its a pretty decent couple of hours to spend watching the spectacle so I would recommend it from that perspective whole heartedly.",6,1,7,15 November 2009
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Just a plain old bad movie
","They say this movie is aimed at teenage girls. Perhaps it is but surely this is an insult to their intelligence. I very often can get a good laugh at a badly scripted movie, but not this one. Ironically there is a scene in the movie of three characters going to see a guns all out blazing movie. One of the characters is displayed with a look of disgust on his face as he watches the nonsense on the screen. But how come I was saying to my self I wish I was watching that one. Anything but this.My brothers 12 year old warned me not to hire it on DVD. I should have taken her advice.",3,6,9,5 September 2010
Inception," Comedy
","If you must watch this caper then I would recommend you watch it as if you were watching a comedy. At least then its tolerable. As you watch just imagine the delirious brainwashed mind salivating at the infantile plot. Titter away at the scenes and dialogue they perceive as intellectually gigantic (easy to spot). Guffaw at the endless streaming dialogue intended to inform their low IQ brain what's going on (otherwise they wouldn't have a clue, guaranteed) I have no complaints about the acting or the production in general. I do however have to complain about the annoying score which was terribly loud. At times it was so loud it was actually painful in the mid range.",3,5,9,7 November 2010
Taken 2," This farce has to be Olivier Megatons fault.
","Call me a crazy nut job, but I expected so much better. I very much liked the first Taken but this really was a joke.I think Neeson knew this film had gone pear shaped and probably gave up because you kind of sense it in some of the scenes and to be honest his acting in this was well below his usual high standard. I don't blame him at all really, and to his credit its only his his presence which sort of holds the entire thing together. The majority of blame for this joke factory (not that its funny in any way) should be laid at the directors feet. A truly awful job by Olivier Megaton - there is nothing mega about this guys effort.On paper, the premise of the film seems fine - although rather predictable. But its surely the directors job to pour some soul and magic in to the mix and create something worthy. But he failed miserably and the result is a shameful film executed with zero pace, tension, style, or anything remotely resembling a pro job. Some blame also has to go to the script writing. Now, I don't know if Luc Besson actually wrote the script spoken by the cast, but if he did its a terrible effort from him. But then again, even with a very average script a good director could have made a half decent movie of this genre - especially considering he had the original Taken to reference and Liam Neeson to work with. A golden opportunity has been missed here. Liams likable character had so much to offer in terms of development, but you get none of that at all. In fact his character is completely watered down. In the first instalment he reminded me as a cross between leon and James Bond but in Taken 2 he's just some bloke running around with a gun taking out the bad guys without breaking a sweat. At no time do you actually feel Liam or his family are in any real danger. Its like watching a kid playing an X box shoot em up game on very easy mode.The question I ask my self is didn't anyone notice how bad the script, the directing or any other multitude of film making sins whilst this thing was being created? Was it to late during the early stages to make script changes, even re-do some of the plot - or better yet, sack Megaton? Didn't anyone speak up? Megaton, didn't you notice how crap a job you were doing as you played back the days filming results. Did you not notice you couldn't coax a decent performance out of any of the actors. Did you not notice you have zero ability to inspire cast or crew? Don't mean to be rude Megaton, but if you aim to make more films you seriously need to up your game (massively) or change your career.Im not a massive film buff or know anything about the ins and outs of film making. There are far more knowledgeable people on IMDb who know the score. But what I do know is this film is crap, and even I could have directed this about a billion times better than this guy - despite never having directed a film in my life. I really should get my self on a plane to Hollywood as it seems anyone can get a directing job.",3,0,0,14 January 2013
