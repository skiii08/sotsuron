Blade Runner 2049," Beautifully bleak
","Bladerunner 2049 is a faithful successor to the original in that it doesn't try to appease the 'fidget spinner' generation who need fast cuts and yappy dialogue to sustain their limited attention spans.Its languid, methodical pace allows the viewer to soak up every ounce of atmosphere in each gorgeously rendered frame, to feel totally immersed in the haunting bleakness of it all. As the camera rises through colossal cityscapes permeated with smog and glowing neon, as the synths ebb and surge like waves, there is a sense of desolation and ruin, a consumerist culture turned cancer that has driven humanity to a dark place figuratively and spiritually.The plot unravels slowly, with no great urgency, but it is nonetheless intriguing, as Bladerunner K's world is shaken by the discovery of a replicant's 'miracle birth' and his road to finding the child leads him to experience the emotions and value decisions which ultimately make us human. These existential themes are what Bladerunner has always been about, rather than explosive, pounding action sequences -though there are sporadic moments of action, it's not the emphasis. So if you go to this film and encounter people yawning, chances are they had the wrong expectations.Gosling and Ford are as watchable as always, but the female characters are particularly engaging. Robin Wright oozes authority as the tough as nails Lieutenant Joshi. Ana de Armas has a difficult task in trying to make her character, Joi (K's perfect hologram girlfriend) feel sympathetic, but the innocent exuberance she displays as she tries to navigate the boundaries of her own virtual existence in her relationship with K is affecting. The main antagonist, Luv, played with ice-cold menace by Sylvia Hoeks, is a real standout. Perhaps the first female villain I've watched who doesn't come off as titular, she is a very threatening presence throughout the film. The only strike for me was Jared Leto's performance as the evil Niander, who's lofty haiku dialogue and John Malkovich style cadence felt overplayed and camp.I think fans of the original Bladerunner will enjoy this sequel and even if you are not that engaged with the minutia of the story, there is much to enjoy on a scene by scene basis. For me I was totally lost in the mood and even at 160 minutes, it didn't feel wasted. Of course there are those who will dismiss it as too slow and boring; With the way movies are edited today, it's not surprising, but it is a shame. Bladerunner 2049 is art.",8,7,15,16 October 2017
Fury," Awful, predictable rubbish
","Without being facetious at all, the only worth while moment in this film was Brad Pitt taking his shirt off and revealing that yes, at 51, he's still got it.The rest of the film was an endurance test through some of the worst 'frat boy' dialogue I've ever heard. If you took the words 'pv$$y, 'motherfv*ker' and 'Nazi scum' out of the script, you'd pretty much be left with some bible quotes and a few lines of Brad Pitt speaking atrocious German.Characters shout, cuss and antagonize each other to an aggravating degree. The story arc is so predictable you will have figured out who's going to die in the end after the first 15 minutes. The pacing is arduously bloated in parts, most notably during a sequence involving the film's only two female characters. It drags out for what seems like 20 minutes during which very little is said, but has plenty of pointlessly awkward tension that amounts to nothing.I was at least expecting to be entertained by some explosive action, but the battle sequences were disappointingly dull, repetitive and messily edited. Also some of the post-production effects were rather cheap; the bullet rounds looked like laser fire from the Starship Enterprise.Worst of all for me was the director's failure in his obvious attempt to impart emotional weight to all the flagrant violence. We see glimpses of the crew's frailty beneath the veneer of bravado, but it all feels so forced. Shia LaBeouf spends the majority of his screen time with a puffy frog-eyed expression as if he's constantly on the verge of tears. Bible verses are recited, violins surge, people are blown apart like shredded pork, yet I never felt impassioned by any of it, and kept thinking how Spielberg did it so much better in 'Saving Private Ryan'.Performance wise, Logan Lerman's character is the only one who generates any sympathy. Brad Pitt talks in that same fake-sounding 'Muurican' accent he adopted for 'Inglorious Basterds'. It sounds strained, like a teenager trying to seem gruffer than he is. The other two mutts are clearly meant to be annoying and antagonistic, but their 'redemption' doesn't come early enough, and I was honestly willing them to die sooner rather than later.All in all, I cannot understand how 'Fury' garnered such positive reviews. It's undeniable that compared to the many great war movies from which it borrows, it is definitely on the lower tier.",3,2,8,14 November 2014
Hostel," Contemptible muck
","Let's get one thing straight: Eli Roth is a dirt bag and Quentin Tarantino is an even bigger dirt bag for lending his 'oh-so-venerable' name to this vacuous mess of a film.The core idea of the film is good. In fact it had the potential to become one of the most gut-wrenching horrors of all time. The idea of a business that captures and provides helpless victims for wealthy sadists who like to vent their frustrations by shoving power-drills into people's eye sockets is bloody terrifying, especially since, in this day and age, we know that somewhere in the world that idea is probably a reality. However, when the director is Eli Roth who can't seem to see anything past his permanently erect penis, the potential for a structured horror movie becomes marred with senseless sex scenes that serve no other purpose than to pacify Roth's miscreant compulsions.If I want to watch a porno I will go to an adult video store and rent a porno. When I watch a horror film, I do not expect to have to sit through an hour of giggling nymphets with gigantic breasts copping off with each member of the male cast, as well as each other.The three lechers in question start off their escapades by sampling the offerings of perhaps all of Amsterdam's red light districts before heading off to Bratislava where, according to some random sleaze-ball with a mole on his lip, the girls are more wanton than pigs in heat. They check into this hostel where even the receptionist looks like she warped out of 'Naughty Nurses II' and become roomies with two flirty, 25 inch-waisted, ample-breasted Slovakians. Clearly it's a dream holiday for any man who has never heard of venereal diseases.However things turn nasty when one of their compadres disappears...cue the cheesy doom-impending trumpets from the 1930's. The film then descends down the usually trail of illogical pitfalls and contrived coincidences pervading most horror movies. Our hapless goons follow complete strangers around the alleyways of Bratislava looking for information in derelict warehouses (obviously the first place you'd visit after checking out of a hostel). And as the gloved hands reach out of the shadows and strap them into rusty, metal chairs in a room cluttered with sharp gardening utensils they realise too late that they've been led into a trap. Who would have suspected such treachery from the brunette with the evil laugh and perfect tits? The torture scenes that follow are tense and a little cringy Â–power-drills, chainsaws, blowtorches, wire clippers- but they are still tame in comparison with Takeshii Mike's Audition, since the camera usually flicks away for most of the sick shots, and since we feel absolutely nothing for the victims it seems little more than violence for the sake of it, another form of porn.Of course fortune smiles on one boy who manages to escape through a string of unbelievable conveniences: his retarded torturer slips on a pair of fingers lying on the floor and shreds himself in half with his own chainsaw. After our guy breaks free he finds a snazzy business suit to conceal himself in, a glove to cover his severed hand, a pistol to shoot bad guys with and an escape car with the keys still in the ignition.Towards the end of the film the violence becomes so random and sensationalized it's almost comical: As he drives out he happens upon the two girls responsible for his capture and rams into them at full speed. A group of young vandals, paid with bubblegum, cover his ass by smashing in his pursuers' heads with rocks and crowbars. An unfortunate Japanese girl who also escapes the torture chambers spots her mutilated, one-eyed reflection and despairingly throws herself in front of an oncoming train. And just when you think the bloodbath has run dry, he spots the man who killed his best friend, follows him into a restroom and slits his throat. I guess we're supposed to realise that our protagonist has become what he was initially victimized by, but if you're like me you will see it as nothing more than a vulgar excuse for mindless evisceration.This entire film seemed to be fashioned around violence and sex, like Roth had all these fantasies of different ways in which he could show women with their clothes off and niggling thoughts about the most excruciating way to kill a man and then weaved a script around that. The dialogue is pathetic, full of numb headed frat boy humour and rainbow hued profanity. The acting is quite stilted, except maybe during the torture scenes, but heck, anyone can scream non stop for five minutes. The music is cheesy and out of sync with what is happening on screen, blasting out ominous tones when their is absolutely nothing ominous about the scene.I have not seen Cabin Fever, but I have heard it was made in the same vein, ergo I will not be watching it. I must seriously discredit Eli Roth's ability as a film director. His films have all the half baked emptiness of a porno.",2,2,3,14 September 2006
Batman Returns," Deliciously dark
","This, in my opinion, was the best Batman movie yet made, because it achieved the right balance between realism and insanity. Batman Begins tried to find realistic explanations for the freakishness behind its heroes and villains. The world of a comic book hero should not be deconstructed so. Mystery and fantasy should be encouraged, because it makes things so much less predictable. It also allows the creative art director to go absolutely bonkers!!! The Gotham City that Tim Burton creates, projects the world of the comic book onto the big screen with complete faithfulness. Floating somewhere between 40's Chicago and 90's New York, its mass of high rise structures provide a glittering backdrop to the predominantly night time scenes, in which silence is torn apart by flame juggling clowns and psychedelic carnival freaks, a mad business tycoon who wants to rule the city and a vengeful seductress in skintight black leather. All driven by a stellar cast who clearly love the saga and enjoy every line given to their characters. One thing that can be said about the cast is that the primary focus is completely stolen from Batman by the villains. However, the magic used by De Vito and Pfeifer to portray their characters Penguin and Catwoman is so damn alluring I can't see it as a bad thing.The tone oscillates zestfully between child's play and adult fun; the conventional quips are loaded with slick wit and raunchy innuendo, and hearty laughs are followed by harsh violence. It's a roller-coaster, a guilty pleasure. I might agree that Batman Returns is a little more icing than sponge, but when the icing tastes so good, who cares?",8,1,2,27 August 2007
Cloverfield," Not the mess I thought it would be
","By that I mean I didn't puke from motion sickness, although I did get a bit of a headache during one or two scenes. The hand held camera can be disorientating but it adds a gripping immediacy to the terrifying events and totally immerses you in the thick of it. That is of course if you can suspend disbelief long enough to accept that the camera man manages to keep filming while monsters, missiles and fiery debris rain down around him like lottery balls in a shuffling machine.We are plonked into an apartment to share in the humorous, occasionally annoying banter of a few likable Manhattan yuppies who rudely have their clambake interrupted by a giant squid/crab/turtle like creature who takes considerable offense to tall buildings and men in green uniforms firing rockets into his face. The explosions, the dust clouds, the wounded civilians, all captured on what looks like grainy news footage create a distinctly 9/11 feel and it's an interesting memory or emotion to play on.We are told absolutely nothing about...well, anything. There is no explanation as to why the monster is there at all, but the threat, the danger is emphatically realized. Clueless as the characters in the movie, we are left to fathom things at the rate at which they happen, and this mystery makes for a largely unpredictable and stimulating experience.The acting is credible and I appreciate the director's decision not to use big name actors. This for the most part really does feel like a documentation that was found in a ruin, if not for a few contrived incidences, most notably at the end where we finally get to view the monster in all it's grumpy faced, tentacle lashing glory. The SFX are terrific but some moments have a distinct CGI shininess to them. Dialoge contains a lot of improv as you would expect, it's supposed to be real life, and it goes around in circles a bit. The phrase 'OH MY GOD!!!' is repeated frequently, yet one would expect less of a PG-13 response to a giant mutant vapourising Central Park! There is also humour scripted in the least likely of places, which is appreciated yet detracts from the effect of a real life documentation.All in all Cloverfield was a fresh, exciting, slightly nauseating way to watch New York get pulverized all over again.",7,0,1,12 February 2008
Silent Hill," Bloody awful, in more ways than one.
","Let me first start by saying this movie's story is not, I repeat NOT as complicated as everybody makes it out to be. In fact most of the missing links and supposed plot holes are fused together in a lengthy, grainy flashback narrated by Alessa herself. The ending is a puzzlement, not in a Donnie Darko brain-boggling way, but more so because it wasn't relevant to the game and seems a strange route to take in terms of establishing a sequel. It is made blindingly obvious to us the events that have unfolded towards the end. It should not require a second viewing.What the story fails to do is offer anything substantial in terms of the characters' backgrounds and their development. The fundamentalist cult is reduced to nothing more than a crowd of empty headed Quakers who seem to have substituted the normal terms used in everyday conversation like 'hello' and 'how are you?' with 'BURN THE WITCH!'.The dialogue is as hammy as the hogs of hell. One prime example would be just after Rose and Cybil have a escaped a vicious attack by Pyramid Head's Great Knife, and a horde of flesh eating cockroaches. Supposedly frantic mother turns to terrified cop and proclaims calmly 'Hey, it's OKÂ…we're gonna be OK'. In a speech to her faithful congregation, mad old Christabella manages to repeat exactly the same point five times over but with a different phrasing: 'She is a witch, she must be burned' 'She is a demon, she must be cleansed' 'Cleanse the sinner in the fire' blah, blah, blah.The acting is cringe worthy, and despite what most reviewers have said, the golden raspberry does not go to Sean Bean. Rhada Mitchell is as wooden as a clog and seems to have her tongue shoved firmly in her cheek the whole time. When she and Cybil stumble into the church after being splattered with blood and chunks of Anna's skin, she turns to the camera looking as though she's just been caught in a summer shower. She delivers most of her lines in a rambling, robotic way, as if she were rehearsing them to herself at her makeup table before shooting. In fairness the script is crap and most actors do make a significant effort, most noticeably Alice Krige, who oozes the same menacing regal which she displayed as the Borg Queen. Deborah Kara Unger, who I must say still manages to look astonishingly beautiful clothed in a potato sack, also gives a good performance. Sean Bean's character serves little purpose, other than to give brief respites from the insanity of the town. These breaks are badly timed, however, and kill the film's momentum. His involvement and relevance to the story are minimal and it really feels like he was just thrown in to avoid claims of sex discrimination in the cast.The one thing the movie managed to get right was of course the art direction, and there was the occasional little thrill at seeing the familiar alleyways and corridor shots. The CGI effects are quite impressive, especially in the bathroom scene. They're not so effective, however, when applied to the monsters, like the Straight-Jacket Man or the Cinder Children. It was an instant tension killer to see a wrathful demon child look up at Rose with fake, shiny, Bambi eyes.Another thing that bugged me about the monsters was their relevance, or lack of, to Rose's character. We know that in the games the monsters were mocking manifestations of each character's psyche, his darkest nightmare represented as a real, physical threat, which created a deeply personal horror. Yet it seems the monsters in the movie only exist to give gamers a boner and to pop out randomly at Rose, saying 'Boo! I have appeared and now you will die'. Pyramid Head looked awesome, but he was only in the film for two scenes as nothing more than a brutish minion. The nurses looked both sufficiently sexy and repulsive, but what they have to do with Rose or Alessa, I don't know.The gore wasn't nearly as explosive as I thought it would be. I had too little emotional engagement with the characters to care whether or not they lived or died. And, unless you've been living in a plastic bubble for the last 20 years of your life, you will not find this movie remotely scary.I went to see the film in a theater packed with obviously avid fans and curious non-gamers. As a fan I was slumped low, my stomach gurgling, not with fear or excitement, but embarrassment and disappointment. When Rose dramatically burst into the church to see Sharon dangling above a pit of flame, and once again says 'It's OK baby, everything's going to be OK' the audience burst out laughing, and I had to laugh with them. I appreciate that the story was ridiculous from the start, but I'm sure a better script and more competent acting would have encouraged our suspension of disbelief a little more.I respect what Gans has tried to do, but it hasn't worked. Silent Hill offers nothing special and flops clumsily under the bar.",1,8,18,22 April 2006
Interstellar," Entertaining nonsense, but no masterpiece
","'Interstellar' pretends to be more intelligent than Alfonso CuarÃ³n's audio-visual roller coaster, 'Gravity', but ironically its best moments are those which, like Gravity, rely purely on thrill and spectacle.For the rest of the film we are crammed into a tiny shuttle with McConaughey and his crew, or back on earth with the desperate remnants of human civilization as they attempt to solve the problem of starvation. Most of the dialogue consists of reams and reams of contrived quantum-physics babble, which, if you're like me, will whoosh straight over your head like those exposition sequences in CSI, with brief moments of levity provided by the two -weirdly cubic looking- robots TARS and CASE.Their journey to find another habitable planet is marred by a sequence of seemingly insurmountable problems that become progressively so ludicrous, it ends up impossible to take them seriously, albeit exciting to watch.We already have to stretch our disbelief past the opening premise that the world is dying because of crop blight, yet they've managed to build robots that have human intelligence and can adapt a variety of shapes to achieve a wide range of tasks. One wonders why humans at this level of technological advancement couldn't have found a solution to curbing this unexplained blight other than blasting off into a foreign galaxy to try and populate a mysterious planet neighboring a black hole.Glaring plot issues aside (and there are many), the film is at its best when in full space simulator mode and the audience is being catapulted into the roaring white light of a black hole, accompanied by Hans Zimmer's electrifying score (props to Zimmer for once NOT composing something that sounded exactly like Pirates of The Caribbean), making full use of the IMAX experience.Performances are fairly solid, in particular Jessica Chastain as the grown up Murph, and there is enough raw emotion on show to push some of the more logically questionable moments past your cynic meter and give a sense of weight and importance to what is happening, even if you can't quite understand it.Definitely worth watching on the big screen, but would I give it a 9/10? No way. This is a film that you will enjoy on face value, but once you leave the cinema you will start picking it to shreds. There are just too many inconsistencies, contrivances and blatant stupidity in the plot to call this a masterpiece, but I'd give it a solid 7 for blockbuster entertainment value.",7,18,34,10 November 2014
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Entertaining, but a little forced in parts
","Three Billboards sets up its protagonist's reputation as an unfearing ball-breaker right from the start; A hard-faced Frances McDormand swaggers into the office of an advertising agency, and with a wad of cash and a toilet-mouth, obtains three disused billboards with the plan to shame the police officers responsible for her daughter's murder case into action.The film is fast paced, dynamically shot and well acted, with a twisty plot and a cast of flawed, but likable characters who shift and challenge expectations. I mostly enjoyed it, but I couldn't shake some niggling problems with the screenplay.Much of the 'humour' relies on characters being needlessly acerbic to one another, flinging vulgar insults and random groin kicks around for a cheap laugh, which for the first 40 minutes of character set up, feels contrived, tedious and unrealistic. It doesn't take long to see a pattern emerge in these exchanges, which always show Mildred coming out on top, usually by just dropping an F-bomb and swaggering out of the room. You know, for example, as soon as the parish priest comes round for tea, that it won't be long before she makes some barb about buggering alter boys. The audience I watched it with laughed a lot at these moments, but I found myself barely making a smirk.What also bothered me was the blatant leftist social justice propaganda behind a lot of this. It's like Mildred sometimes just becomes a meme-megaphone for 'sticking it to the man', in this case the useless white cops who are presented as a bunch of dumb, redneck racists 'too busy torturing black people' to do what's right. The director may as well have dressed her in a Black Lives Matter T-shirt (I suppose it's no coincidence Mildred, always clad in overalls, bears a resemblance to the ubiquitous 'We Can Do It' poster). Those gripes aside, the second half of the film really opens up the character arcs with an unexpected turn that delivers more unexpected turns, higher stakes and the potential for redemption. Throughout the film, McDormand delivers a stellar performance that shows vulnerability beneath her hard exterior and the supporting actors do a terrific job. Recommended, but not a Best Picture winner for me.",7,2,6,3 February 2018
American Hustle," Excruciatingly bad
","Never before has a cinema visit made me want to physically hurt myself.For two and a half bum-numbing hours I sat, jaw clenched, temples twitching as this loud, obnoxious farce of a film clattered along, all the while thinking 'how the hell did THIS get nominated for several Oscars?'.The entire running time of 'American Hustle' can pretty much be summarized as a collection of vignettes in which you have spoiled, nasty, unlikable characters shouting and bickering at each other hysterically over absolutely nothing. It is the epitome of a current trend in American films to fill time with yappy, antagonistic improv in a shallow attempt to create tension and humour without actually furthering the plot or the characters.Some of the dramatic mood shifts feel so forced and poorly developed, for example, the bitchy bathroom exchange between Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams that ends in a totally contrived and bizarre lesbian kiss, clearly put in for shock value.Equally shallow is the film's treatment of it's female characters, Adams in particular. Her every turn to camera is frozen in a glacial-eyed expression as though she's being photographed for the cover of Vogue. The camera zooms in and out of her gaping cleavage like a horny fly. In one scene, Bradley Cooper forces her into a toilet cubicle and gropes her ass, while she stands pert like a porn star, the camera leering up her skirt. It's cringe-worthy.Hardest to bare was Bradley Cooper, easily the loudest and most manic of the lot. Every scene with him just made me want to wring his neck. Perhaps the only saving grace is Jennifer Lawrence, mainly there for comedic value, she goes full pelt and is fun to watch, but I wasn't convinced by her relationship with Bale's character or her vulnerability.There is so little emotional weight to this film. No matter how hard the characters screamed, grimaced and cried, I didn't believe or care about any of it. I was emotionally numb. It felt like watching a bunch of teenagers playing dress up and pretending to be edgy and adult. Flashy costumes and atrocious wigs, hiding nothing of substance.Easily one of the most over-rated Oscar nominated films since 'Crash'.",2,3,4,10 December 2014
Baby Driver," A film so in love with itself, it needs its own cinema seat
","'Baby Driver' is showy, clichÃ©-ridden and irritatingly self-aware. It's like that yappy drama society kid at college who is so consciously trying to act cool by breaking into song, dancing around chairs, drumming on desks and spitting jokey one-liners with a hand pistol flourish....the kind of person a cynical SOB like me just wants to punch in the throat.The central premise is about a young, good-at-heart kid forced into a life of crime in order to pay off a debt. The annoyingly slick, Abercrombie-faced 'Baby' is not only the fastest getaway driver in Atlanta, we later find out he's also a self-taught music producer, dancer and talented free-runner...are you rolling your eyes yet?The main mechanic, so lauded by critics, is that everything in the film revolves around music, from the editing to the dialogue. Since Baby is constantly plugged into his i-pod (so, we are told, to drown out tinnitus from a car accident which killed his parents), the film essentially plays like one giant music video, with nearly every gunshot, tire screech and sassy put down edited meticulously with the beats or riffs of whatever track is playing during the sequence.Unfortunately the songs didn't make the hackneyed screenplay that much more interesting. While there are some splendid car chase sequences (too few in my book), one must endure cringey moments of Baby miming and dancing to James Brown, dull characters waxing poetic about song lyrics and saying clichÃ© bull$hit like 'Sometimes all I want to do is head west on the 20 in a car I can't afford with a plan I don't have'. Everyone in the film is pretty, none of the gangsters really look like gangsters, least of all the Latina 'Darling', who can't even hold a gun convincingly and is just there to show cleavage and lick her lips at camera.Imagine the most indulgent ideas from Guy Ritchie and Tarantino's trash bin channeled through a Justin Bieber video. Less style and even less substance.There are no doubt people who will love it for being a showy piece of nonsense, and there is some entertaining, high impact action, but it's far from the genius some critics are praising it as. I saw it with a group of youngish people who all agreed it wasn't as good as they'd hoped and that some bits were just plain daft.Leave your brain at home and perhaps you'll be rewarded...",5,545,913,2 July 2017
X-Men: The Last Stand," A sloppy end to what could have been an awesome trilogy
","X-Men 3:The Last Stand was undoubtedly an entertaining film, but for all its visual marvel and its maelstrom of explosive action sequences, it fails to be brilliant for one reason; there is too much going on.It picks up sometime (we're to assume recently) after the supposed death of psychic Jean Grey. While her friends and colleagues Wolverine and Storm are trying to cope without her, they become gripped by the news that the human government has found a way to suppress the mutant gene and is opening its doors to any mutant who wishes to relinquish their powers and achieve a normal status in society. However, right-wing mutant fundamentalist, Magneto, rejects the so called 'cure' as an insult and with the help of an army of vengeful mutants, rises up against the humans who, as it turns out, are planing to enforce the cure with or without mutant consent. Meanwhile Scott (aka Cyclops) revisits the dam where he last saw his beloved wife swept away by a wall of water. She mysteriously reappears, not as the Jean he once knew, but as the ferociously powerful goddess, Phoenix...can you see how this creates a problem? As comic book purists have already vehemently pointed out, the Phoenix saga stretches over four episodes! So it makes me wonder how any scriptwriter would believe that they could successfully crush such a huge legacy into a 100 min film, while also trying to accommodate the inevitable Magneto Vs Humans war and still have time to build tangible, three-dimensional characters along the way. How could Ratner hope to do that when his movie is half an hour shorter than the his predecessor's? Between the X-Men, Magneto's goons, the White House officials, the US army and the malevolent Phoenix, the movie becomes a wild battle for screen time. Many of the more prominent and intriguing characters from the first two films taste barely two minutes of the running time before they are either stripped of their powers, or destroyed. It was a most unsavoury feeling for me to see characters who I had become so attached to over the course of the last two films, suddenly being recklessly obliterated. Save for the character of Beast, played excellently by Kelsey Grammar, virtually none of the new mutants introduced actually speak a word. We are told absolutely nothing about them and we must accept that they serve no purpose other than to blast energy bolts, kick people in the face and make things explode. It was a let down, almost an insult to watch this mass mistreatment of so many important characters.The visual effects in this film are amazing, most notably the hair-raising (or should I say 'house-raising') scene with Phoenix and Xavier in the Grey House, the destruction and flight of the Golden Gate Bridge and the explosive showdown between the X-men and Magneto's forces, which displayed some truly breathtaking scenes.However, when Ratner's not directing action his inferiority to Singer shows through. X3 feels like a much more static and plainer looking film than its predecessors. This is mainly down to Ratner's camera work lacking the polished, dynamic genius of Singer's, who gave the first two films a real comic book feel. Ratner also tends to indulge in the special effects bucket all too much, unlike Singer who used a more subtle approach. There's only so much razzle-dazzle that you can throw at an audience, if yeh don't got the script or the characters...it's gonna fall flat.The actors all do a brilliant job, even if some of the best actors are only on screen for five minutes! Famke Jackson plays the Phoenix with frightening charisma (although she was helped greatly by black contacts and pulsing thread veins). Hugh Jackman seems to fit right at home as the rustic, rippling anti-hero Wolverine. Hally Berry's role as Storm seemed strange. Apparantley after plans to leave she told writers she would stay on only if they extended her role. I can see how she was 'upgraded' to the status of leader, but she still seemed to take the back seat behind Wolverine. On a negative note, I thought the casting of Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut was just stupid. I don't remember Juggernaut ever sounding like an cockney boot boy.X3 was indeed a loud, cheesy, epileptic romp that was, for the most part, enjoyable. It's just so unfortunate that it tried to take on too much at once and had to sacrifice so many great characters. If only they hadn't caged themselves with this trilogy idea and had dealt with the Phoenix saga and Magneto's war as two separate films.As a movie on its own, Ratner's X3 is acceptable. However, as the conclusion to a trilogy, it is thoroughly empty and disappointing.",6,6,11,30 May 2006
Call Me by Your Name," A sensual love story that inflames the heart.
","'Call Me by Your Name' is an hypnotically beautiful coming of age drama that surpasses the clichÃ© of the 'queer film' as overwrought naval-gazing depression fantasy full of sleazy sex, instead celebrating the intoxicating passion of youthful love with tender sensuality. Set in 1983, it details the sexual awakening of a precocious teenager named Elio, who is besotted with the arrival of a handsome older student, Oliver, who comes to stay at his family's pastoral Italian villa for the summer.As they both lounge listlessly in the sun-drenched Lombardian countryside, swimming and cycling to coffee shops, the first half of the film dances an artful choreography of stolen glances, innuendo and mixed signals as the pair try to work out where the other's feelings lie. When the two finally realize their desire for one another and become lovers, it is with the bittersweet understanding that they must part ways at summer's end, when Oliver returns to America. This is the only real source of tension in the story. Despite Oliver and Elio's discretion in their affair, there is no obvious homophobic backdrop or bullying influence around them. Indeed Elio's cultured, cosmopolitan parents are both very thoughtful and accepting people, even hinting to Elio quite early on that he can speak to them about anything. So how does a film with no major conflict keep us engaged and invested in the relationship? By making us fall in love with it. Luca Guadagnino's entrancing direction lowers the defenses with a languid pace and indulgent cinematography that soothes and seduces. The atmosphere is heady with the carefree exuberance of youth which we so long to experience again. This is the summer we wished we had. At times it seems almost absurdly idyllic; The cynic in me was ready to scoff at the hyper-sophistication of Elio's wealthy, scholarly, multi-lingual family who spend their time discussing politics, citing poetry and transcribing Bach. Elio's teenage friends seem to be comprised of a posse of French and Italian Lacoste models. You might think who could possibly relate to this? Nonetheless I was gradually swept away by the blissful escapism, almost feeling like I was there at times.The cast are all superb. Armie Hammer, while looking a bit older than his character's 24 years, is such a commanding presence as Oliver, with his statuesque good looks and resonant voice. He gives him that strong, confident worldly charm that is so instantly beguiling to young Elio. Michael Stuhlberg and Amira Casar as Elio's parents are benevolent, nurturing forces. But the true standout here is Timothee Chalamet. With his big soulful eyes he navigates all of the complexity of Elio's emergent feelings, imbuing him with a feline sensuality one minute and naive emotional fragility the next.The scenes of sex are not gratuitous, with the director choosing instead to focus on the erotic build up, the playful kissing and teasing, the tender touches. It all feels so honest and natural, two characters just completely being themselves and loving one another for it. I was completely enthralled by Oliver and Elio's relationship, and found myself sad to not have experienced one just like it. I also couldn't help but be sad as I contemplated the tender transience of youth, for which the peach is a symbol. By the time the heartbreaking final scene rolled out I was sobbing, full of nostalgia for my own teenage years, the time I wasted and chances not taken.Go see this film and allow yourself to feel.",10,52,105,19 November 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," The franchise is dying with every release
","Either the X-Men films are getting worse, or I'm just too old and too cynical to invest in the farce anymore.I still maintain that 'X2' is the best film in the series. It had a dynamism and a smartness of pace that has been severely lacking in the latest installments to date. I had hoped Singer's return would bring back those punchy, high octane, humorous elements which I enjoyed.'Days of Future Past' almost managed it, with some terrific action sequences, and a real sense or threat, but the time travel story was messy and only created confusion. Its saving grace was Hugh Jackman's performance as Wolverine, which has certainly carried the series a good deal of the way so far. This latest installment unfortunately suffers from his absence.Overall I found 'X-Men: Apocalypse' to be dull, predictable, devoid of humour, clichÃ©-ridden and embarrassingly hammy in parts. The dialogue is often childish and silly, Professor Xavier's sophomoric slobbering over Moira MacTaggart is one cringey example of a 'dumbing down'. Oscar Isaac's performance as the titular villain is believably threatening, but he is betrayed by a ridiculous costume and makeup that gives him the appearance of an 80's glam rock diva. His 4 horsemen are also woefully unimpressive, and I couldn't help but chuckle at the many shots of them posturing around together in what was supposed to be an imposing death brigade, but looks more like a bunch of awkward misfits at a rainbow party.Sophie Turner does not convince as Jean Grey. Perhaps it's the throaty, whiny tone to her voice that means I just can't see her as anything but Sansa Stark doing a generic American accent. She certainly doesn't look like she could grow up to be Famke Janssen, who played the older Jean, and that bothered me too. The movie clearly wants us to be wowed by the effects. The action is more bombastic and world-ending than ever, yet manages to feel stilted. Landmarks explode and spiral in a whirl of cluttered CGI, yet none of these sequences have any real impact, or sense of danger, since no actual people are visibly caught up in the destruction. There's just no reason to care.We also have a bullet-time montage literally copy and pasted from the last film where Quicksilver zips effortlessly through a building to save the inhabitants from a creeping explosion, all set to 'Sweet Dreams' by Eurythmics. It feels so out of place tonally, and ultimately lazy and arrogant for expecting people to laugh at the same goofy gag all over again.Throughout the whole film I just couldn't shake this seen-it-all- before feeling. A mixture of bemusement and boredom. I fear it can only get worse from here.",4,2,11,3 July 2016
Ex Machina," Intriguing, unpredictable and tense
","'Ex Machina' deals with a familiar theme in a very unique way. It doesn't bombard you with effects or superficial action (although the robot effects are exceptional). Rather, its focus and beauty lie in the subtle and nuanced performances of its tiny cast as the film explores what it means to be human.Quiet dialogue scenes between two characters are filmed in such an impactful, making them feel hauntingly austere, sweet and innocent, or terrible and frightening, through meticulous use of composition, light and sound. The film really does run the gamut of emotions, surprisingly funny one minute and gut-wrenchingly tense and weird the next, while the script twists and turns, constantly unsettling your assumptions about what will happen. The performances are excellent, most notably Alicia Vikander as the beguiling Ava, who absolutely passes for being 'almost human'. Her precise movements -walking, standing or stooping to pull on a pair of stockings- have just that slight tinge of the uncanny about them to suggest a mechanical skeleton, yet she is undeniably seductive. You can really understand Caleb's mental plight as she begins to show signs of a sexual interest in him!Domhnall Gleeson also delivers a quiet and focused performance as Caleb, which reflects much of the film's over all style. Like Ava, he is relatable, yet has this slight autistic aloofness about him, in complete contrast to the boorish, reckless Nathan (Oscar Isaac). The dialogue feels real and non-clichÃ©. The pacing for the most part is measured, although one or two scenes might move a little slower than they need to.The ending probably will not satisfy everyone, and admittedly left me a feeling a bit cold, but it certainly didn't follow the route I was expecting. Overall I found it to be enthralling and disturbing stuff.",8,355,484,23 January 2015
Coco," Sweet, emotional and visually superb
","'Coco' is not Pixar's best film in my opinion. It doesn't achieve the completeness of other monumental titles like 'The Incredibles' or 'Toy Story 3', nor does it match the inspired cleverness of 'Inside Out'. It is, however, an appealing, colourful and emotionally tender film with unique visuals, enjoyable musical numbers and splendid animation.The respect for authenticity in the representation of Mexican tradition is to be applauded, with the designs of the dead ancestors all built around the graphic skulls that are used to celebrated Dios de los Muertos. Every shot is beautifully crafted, a profusion of glowing candles, marigolds and vibrant festival colour. The film is ultimately about the importance of family, community and honouring your shared history. It's a celebration of culture. I found this was laid on a bit thick at times, with characters often explaining too much of what they do with regards to festival preparations etc, which kind of makes it feel like a lesson. I felt the expository stuff was aimed more toward younger children than a more knowing audience who didn't need to be spoon fed, but anyway it's a small criticism. The emotional moments are not as deftly handled as Carl and Ellie's heartbreaking love-story in Up, they felt a bit syrupy and hammed up in parts, but they still manage to pluck the heartstrings and the ending is well earned, a few plot contrivances aside.Overall the story is well told, with loveable characters, in particular Dante, Miguel's brain-dead dog, who has some of the funniest animation I've seen in a long time, every scene he was in had me in stitches. I also loved the sequence with Frida Kahlo and her avant garde art installation. There's at least enough humour to keep adults entertained, even if most of the film feels aimed more at the under 10's.Coco is good, wholesome fun!",7,0,4,21 January 2018
La La Land," An alright film, but not a great musical
","I enjoyed 'La La Land' as a piece of innocuous, colourful escapism. The two leads are endearing and funny, the cinematography is dynamic, the sentimentality plucks rather than gurns and overall I found the dramatic conclusion to the two young dreamer's relationship emotionally fulfilling. However, the 'musical' element of the film was lacking. It's obvious that the spectacle of the old Hollywood sing along exists in La La Land to counter the real downturns and compromises that Mia and Sebastien are forced to make in their own relationship to achieve the success they crave. Real life isn't like the movies, basically.The problem is that the songs themselves are rather dull and uninspiring, notably the recurring 'music box-esque' piano theme which, while tender and sweet in the right moments, is very simplistic and even childish in structure, sounding curiously unlike anything Sebastien, a jazz pianist, would ever really play.The large ensemble dance numbers are only at the start of the film. Again, none of these are particularly special, though the weaving camera work in the opening traffic jam number was impressive, the songs didn't stay in my memory for very long and Mandy Moore's choreography is more of a set dressing than a feature to be wowed by. The sporadic duets between Mia and Sebastien are also weak. Their voices are thin, lacking substance and their dancing is at best high school play material, filler for the transitions. These peter out by the film's last third to the point where I wondered why they even bothered making it a musical at all. I would not be running to see this on stage in the West End.That said, as a movie experience I enjoyed La La Land. It made me smile, even giggle quite a few times, but I do feel the whimsy and nostalgia for old Hollywood is clouding people's judgment of this as a deserving Oscar winner (even though, in the end, it wasn't one). 'The Artist' this ain't.",6,2,6,12 March 2017
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Melodrama with a capital 'M' darling
","Dracula's success rides on three things:1) The strength of Oldman's performance, which reaches almost superhuman depths. 2) The romantic re-telling of Stoker's classic story. 3) The lush, heady art direction which permeates the brain like an opium-induced stupor.The sexual intonations of Stoker's original plot are brought to the forefront here. Coppolla's film is more a bourgeois erotic fantasy with a supernatural backdrop, but it is so visually splendid that it is impossible not to be swept away with it.Of course it has it's flaws, the most notable being the unforgivable miscasting of Keanu Reeves as Jonathan, who doesn't seem to understand the words coming out of his mouth and acts as though he warped straight out of 'Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure'. His scenes are cringe-worthy. Winona Ryder, while not as bad, is similarly unconvincing with a British accent that would be tolerable only in an 8th grade school play.The other members of the cast are admirable. Oldman literally sucks the scenery dry and oscillates masterfully between ice cold malevolence and warm passionate tenderness. Hopkins is comedic camp as Professor Van Helsing. Sadie Frost is scintillatingly cheeky as the precocious Lucy. Tom Waits is hysterical as Renfield. And Monica Belucci's breasts are divinely inspired.A flawed classic.",7,0,0,15 November 2011
Murder on the Orient Express," A ham-fisted, pointless remake
","I don't care enough about this silly remake to write a detailed review, so I'll just summarize what I hated about it into bullet points:Hammy, pantomime acting from a cast of two-dimensional caricatures. Laughably poor dialogue. Meandering direction. Irrelevant inferences to race tensions. Bloated pacing. Tonal dissonance. Pointlessly flashy cinematography. Obvious CGI green screen sets. A criminally underused Judie Dench. The wink to the impending butchering of 'Murder on The Nile' (and probably every Agatha Christie title ever, for the next 10 years).",3,24,47,5 November 2017
The Woman in Black," Like a ghost train, but with better effects
","This was one of the most generic and amusingly ridiculous haunted house films I've ever seen, but the scares do give you bang for your buck. I suppose it's kind of like 'The Grudge' in that regard. Personally I was expecting more cerebral atmospheric horror than the choreographed staccato JUMP tactics, but it was very much the latter and they were relentless.It just felt more like I was watching one of the those attractions at Disney Land, than an actual movie; 70% of the running time is comprised of Radcliff walking from one ridiculously cobwebbed, creepy doll-littered room to the next while the viewer waits nervously for a piercing violin chord and a scary face to jolt them out of their seats.Radcliff is actually pretty decent for all that he had to do (basically stay wide eyed and tense). CiarÃ¡n Hinds was underused and the rest of the cast were just bleh... Not sure I can compliment the actress who played the ghost, but her makeup team did an exceptional job.Entertaining distraction, but don't expect to even remember the character's names once the credits start rolling.",6,3,4,29 February 2012
Mother!," A metaphorical gut punch
","Based on Darren Aronofsky's previous work, I was already anticipating that Mother! would take some hair-pin bends around my suspension of disbelief, but I wasn't expecting it to leave the road entirely, flip 30 times into a ravine and explode. This is a roller-coaster track through a director's ideological stream of consciousness and you're either in for the ride, or out.Jennifer Lawrence (unnamed, as are all the characters in the film) plays a dreamy, docile housewife to an acclaimed poetic genius, Javier Bardem, suffering from writer's block. The two inhabit a palatial southern Gothic home in the middle of nowhere, half under re-construction after a previously mentioned fire destroyed it. Interrupting their placid existence arrive two strangers, a man and woman who, despite protestations from the suspicious wife, are invited to stay by the friendly host, who hopes their conversations might inspire him to write. Later, the two stranger's squabbling sons show up and violence ensues. This first act is a microcosm for what happens later on, as more devoted fans intrude on the house to profess their 'faith' for their beloved poet, all the while ignoring the beleaguered wife's protests and gradually tearing her 'paradise' apart.Mother! is a pessimistic commentary on mankind's propensity for destruction and depending on your political leanings, there are many ways the events that transpire can be interpreted. There's no coherent narrative. This is a mayhem of religious, environmental and socio-political metaphors, an irreverent mardis gras parade through history from man's first transgression in the Garden of Eden to the Hiroshima bomb. The house stands in for mother earth, slave to the whims of a rapacious, capitalistic greed. And most of this happens in the last 30 minutes, where the grotesque violence increases to an over-whelming intensity and the claustrophobic camera work, shot mostly from Lawrence's point of view, makes for a dizzying and disturbing experience. There's no uplifting message to be taken, no silver- lining, just unapologetic nihilism and wanton imagery that punches you in the gut and grins sadistically.I left the cinema feeling quite shaken, my brain contorted trying to figure out what all the metaphors meant. I felt as though I had been given access to someone else's nightmare. Others were laughing derisively and complaining that it didn't make any sense, failing to grasp the subtext that was so obviously bashing them over the head.As another reviewer pointed out, it's hard to rate something like this honestly. There are many reasons to dislike it on a content level, but certainly bad film making isn't one of them. This is a tour de force of camera work and cinematography and the acting is top notch. I wouldn't be surprised if Jennifer Lawrence had a mental breakdown after filming this, with all the closeups of her gasping tortured face.Mother! is kind of like heroin. It left an impression on me that's for sure. But I'm not recommending it.",6,4,13,17 September 2017
