Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not bad but not worth the wait
","I knew standing in line for 6 hours that I wasn't going to care for the Jar Jar Binks character.  By 12:30 Wednesday morning, my thoughts became reality.  Jar Jar and the leaders of the Trade Federation were the most annoying things I have seen on the movie screen in a while.  I didn't hate this movie.  It definitely picked up when the pod racing began, but I was hoping the movie would be a bit more serious.  The way everything started to unfold at the ending worked very good and I was very interested and seeing that part.  But the lightsaber duel was uninspirational, at least Luke broke a sweat when battling Vader.  I just feel that the movie needed less comedy and more dramatic turns.",7,0,0,21 May 1999
