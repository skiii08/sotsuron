Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good effects, poor film
","Whatever critics say of this film, it make no difference. People will go and see it. But they will think twice about seeing the sequal. Because this film is poor. At the end of the day the effects are superb, the story line and plot pathetic. Thats all i can say.",1,4,7,26 July 1999
Shakespeare in Love," Boring
","Okay, so the picture is quite nice to look at; but apart from that, it really is just a run of the mill romantic film. I can't see how people are making this film out to be brilliant. I am nineteen years old, and maybe this film only appeals to sixty year olds (like the Oscar committee and most Hollywood critics). Avoid this film like the plague, because it is just average. Don't believe the hype.",1,13,28,19 March 1999
The Exorcist," I don't get it
","This film is scary ? Yeah right, and my name is Michael Jackson.This isn't even entertaining - slow and boring",Null,1,3,19 November 1998
The Game," Brilliant !
","This movie is brilliant . I've never been a fan of Michael Douglas , and was a little reluctant to rent this film out, but what a suprise ! ' Its probably one of the best thrillers I have ever seen , if not one of the best films I have ever seen . It is that good . And the ending just blew me away . You have to see this film .",10,0,2,24 October 1998
The Insider," Really cool
","This is a really cool movie, absolutely stunning. The depth of the film is brilliant. Pacino and Crowe give great performances. But the director Michael Mann, absolutely rules. His last film 'Heat' was one of the best thrillers ever made; totally underated. This is more subtle, but just as cool.You have to see it.",Null,0,0,4 November 1999
There's Something About Mary," Poor
","How this film made so much money I will never know . Now before I saw the film I looked through the user comments on this site , and presumed the ones who hated it were probably some old people who didn't find toilet humour funny , if you know what I mean . I loved films like 'Dumb and Dumber' , 'Kingpin' , especially for their out and out slapstick humour . But this flim was nothing like them . On the cover of the advertisement board someone has written something to the effect they laughed so loud they were about to burst . What planet was the person on who wrote that !? The film itself has a good story line , but only at occasional moments did I even open my mouth to laugh . Go and see this film for its story line , because funnily enough it keeps you awake , and mildly interested . But as for any jokes , don't get me started . There were about two decent jokes , but the rest was just pathetic . Its not as if there was an attempt to be funny , there were that few jokes in it . Hugely disappointing . Wait for it to come out on video .",Null,0,0,24 October 1998
Groundhog Day," A classic
","To put it simply, this movie has to be the most funniest movie ever made. It has genuine warmth, and superb acting by all leads. Shamefully ignored by the Oscars (comedies never win Oscars, right ?!). Bill Murray is a god; and this movie is a classic. Anytime you feel down, go to your video shop and rent this. I love it.",10,1,1,20 February 1999
Titanic," Wow !
","Wow ! What a film ! Now , like most males , I hate Di Caprio , but I must admit after watching this , I was very impressed . But as for the film - simply amazing . I salute James Cameron - pure genius . I just cant believe I was so stupid to ignore this film . I presumed it was going to be some boring love story with special effects at the end . But it had much more than that - it was just amazing . The scene where the ship sinks must be hailed as one of the best pieces of cinema history of all time . Bravo !",Null,1,1,29 October 1998
The Waterboy," Terrible
","How can this film make so much money ? How can American critics give great reviews about this film ? This film was not funny . There were no funny jokes in it . I urge you to avoid this film , because it is just that bad .",Null,1,1,16 November 1998
The Sixth Sense," Suprisingly good
","Shock horror, Bruce Willis can act! I'll be the first to admit i like his full on, big budget, action films, but you also have to admit for every good one (Armageddon), he does a bad one (Mercury Rising). But this is a big massive change. He gives a good performance, not over the top, but just right. A possible oscar nomination? As for the film, well you have to see it. It has everything, a good story line, and a great plot twist. We even have a film, in which a young actor is suprisingly good. Other that stand out is Donnie Wahlberg. I think the guy was in New Kids On The Block, but he does a dam fine job, and i forgive him for my ruining music in the 80's. Go see this film, when it comes out on full release.",Null,0,0,26 July 1999
The Matrix," Suprisingly good
","Shock horror, a film with Mr. Reeves that is actually good. If anyone is going to avoid this because of the terrible tripe that was 'Johhny Mnemonic', then think again. This is amazing. If your into high octane films, then go see this, it is really that good.",Null,0,1,19 March 1999
