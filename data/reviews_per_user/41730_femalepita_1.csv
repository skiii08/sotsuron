Mission: Impossible III," Finally saw this movie yesterday!
","I agree with the whole 'shaky cam' presentation being more than annoying, but the intended effect (Saving Private Ryan?) was definitely there. What did bother me, was the occasional 'softened and semi-animated' look that kind of emulated 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow' I didn't like that effect in that movie, and didn't like it in this one either. If I could summarize what the cast and crew was intending to say with this movie, it was HEY, READ MY LIPS, WE ARE IN DEEP MANURE. Definitely got my attention, and agree. 100%. The movie, overall, was pretty good.Confused and prone to wandering",7,0,0,12 June 2006
