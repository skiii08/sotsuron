Alien 3," A dissapoining end (yes END, there was no 4)
","After the horror filled excellence of Alien, and the pulse racing, nail biting brilliance of Aliens, Alien3 is somewhat of a let down.After the events on LV-426, the shuttle craft carrying Ripley, Newt, Hicks and Bishop crash lands on a prison planet, populated by the galaxies worst criminals (murderers, r@pists etc). Hicks and Newt are killed in the crash and Ripley is taken in by the prison warden, but the Alien menace has followed her, and to end the nightmare, she will have to make the ultimate sacrifice.This movie isn't terrible, the acting is pretty good for most part, Weaver delivers once again as the heroine of the trilogy, and she is supported by some of Englands finest actors (Charles Dance, Pete Poselthwaite).Ultimately though, the plot of this movie is where it falls short. The setting is dark and dank, which gives a very depressing feel (this was probably the intention, but it doesn't work for me), and basically, very little happens in this movie. Hicks and Newts deaths are easily spotted as cop outs for the studio failing to re hire the actors rather than plot advancements. Then we have lots of arguing between the prisoners over Ripley, an attempted r@pe, then everyone dies.Alien3 seems too contrived to be taken as a serious movie, and comes across as a student film that tries to be too deep. It also feels like a remake sequel, copying Scotts original master piece, almost shamelessly at times.Not the worst movie ever, but a let down, after the first two classic installments",4,490,521,1 March 2006
From Dusk Till Dawn," I like this, but I don't know why....
","Dusk stars George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino as Seth and Richard Gecko, two professional thieves, also brothers, who are on the run from the FBI in Richita, Texas.The opening 15 minutes is as cool and entertaining as you will likely find in any movie as we are shown Seth (Clooney), the older brother, a thief and scoundrel, but deep down an honorable man who wants nothing more than for he and his brother to get across the Mexican border with their stolen loot, so they can retire in paradise. And the younger brother, Richie (Tarantino), an unhinged psychopath and r@pist who enjoys inflicting pain and death on those unfortunate enough to cross his path.The first half of this movie plays like a psychological thriller, as Seth tries to contain his brothers psychopathic tendencies long enough to get them across the border to safety. When an Ex-Priest (Harvey Keitel) and his two children Kate and Scott (Juliette Lewis, as white trash as ever, and Ernest Liu) stumble across the Gecko brothers, they are taken hostage and are forced to smuggle the brothers over the Mexican border in their motor home.The second half of this movie then becomes an action horror as the Geckos and their captives take refuge in a Mexican bar named the Titty Twister. Unfortunately, the bar is full of crazed Vampire monsters with a lust for blood and the brothers are forced to team with their hostages if they are to make it out alive.Now I DO like this movie, though for the life of me I don't know why! The acting is good, and the action scenes (Pre-Vampire) are well done. The sudden shift in genre halfway through the movie doesn't sit right with me though, as much as it is a novel idea, I feel it came way out of left field and it left me shocked when I first saw the movie.There are some cheesy moments of dialogue, mostly from Clooney, too. The movie, like my opinion of it, cannot seem to make up its mind.Bottom line though, the movie does entertain and Salma Hayeks sexy dance is worth at least one viewing of the film on its own. Also, look out for several cameo appearances from Cheech Marin (of Cheech and Chong fame) playing several minor characters. If you are a fan of action horror and violence, then this film will work for you. Otherwise you probably will not like it. But I do!",7,0,1,23 February 2006
