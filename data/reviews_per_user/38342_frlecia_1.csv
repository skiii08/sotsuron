Skyfall," Hoist the flags!
","Help! Homosexual terrorists that once were secret agents want to bomb London (and what not)! Please secret services everywhere, take away our rights and as much money you'd like, oh please! Don't listen to annoying Ministers concerned with lack of oversight of intelligence agencies (for things like being able to use every camera in town)! After all, what do they know about the 'shadow' world, where villains exist that can hack or explode whatever they want to and are defeated by one single old agent and an old couple, using 'Home Alone' tactics. Please protect us from foreigners before they become homosexual terrorists, and please don't mind about breaking the internet by spying on us, censoring and disrupting content, the world was better without it! I'm sorry if I just told you the film's entire plot, but I couldn't help myself, so much action. With this coming from a post-Wikileaks, pre-Snowden world, I wonder if on the sequel there will be not only terrorists posting leaks (even though, by the Pentagon's own admission, the 'cyber-terrorist' leaks from Wikileaks resulted in no deaths), but if there will be an ex-agent leaking info that needs to be terminated.",1,4,5,18 February 2015
