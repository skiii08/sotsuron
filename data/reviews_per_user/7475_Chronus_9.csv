The Devil's Advocate," Devil has many faces - the terrifying Pacino is one of them
","Well. Strange movie. It starts lightly, almost giving the impression that the director new nothing of the real life in a courthouse; it gets better by showing some friction between mother and daughter-in-law...and then it portrays the strange ways of celebrating victory of a couple. Then comes the devily proposal...  Now he movie gets frightning, although in some shallow way.  But, as it turns out, after having seen it, when you look at it from a wide angle, this movie becomes quite ordinary. The plot does not surprise you, the intended surprises seemed  the work of an amateur writer, who thinks the best shocks come from those things that are supposed to surprise you (wow, the man is his father, wow, that´s his sister, wow, his wife did that, and he did that...). It happens that, nowadays, movie fans do see  a lot of movies, from many years, from many directors, and it takes a good plot and good directing to really surprise them.  I foresaw some events quite a few minutes before I was shown them. Possibilly, lots of people saw it that way too. But anyway, this is a good thing to watch.   The acting... Well, Keanu Reeves is good, Charlize Theron is excellent - quite a revelation she is. But the real bomb, the true interest of this movie lies with Al Pacino. This actor is a phenomenon. He can be a gangster, a blind man... and the devil. He is an astonishing actor, one that will endure forever in our memory - like Spencer Tracy, Bogart, Cagney, John Wayne, Douglas, Connery, De Niro, Morgan Freeman, O´Toole. If I was given a choice between having a video-library of these actors and all the special effects and great soundtracks in the world...I would choose the stories personified by these actor´s characters.  Al Pacino alone holds this movie above the average - and they didn´t even give him a great part. Between Pacino´s acting, Reeves´ performance and the revelation named Charlize Theron - and if you choose to consider a grade C+ plot...well, you get a good enough movie.   Too bad it ends in such a poor way - as if someone (the director, the cast, the producer, some big boss in the studio) were trying to rush it to the finishing.",7,0,1,20 December 1999
12 Monkeys," Twelve Million Reasons to believe science-fiction may be back
","Terry Gilliam. Time Bandits, Monty Phiton, Life of Brian Different film-making, almost revolutionary. With Twelve Monkeys he achieves three fantastic things: a) a great movie; b) a great science-fiction movie and, c) he extracted from Bruce Willis a very good performance, his best to date.Alternate realities and time-travel have always been the focus of written science-fiction since Jules Verne and H. G. Welles. Many authors have produced stories that leave a long lasting impression on the minds of those who read them. So, every time someone dares to make a movie using the element of time-travel (or alternate realities), he/she runs the risk of being anything but original. But Terry Gilliam picked a story from a French director, used it, transformed it to his liking andvoilá, Twelve Monleys.The acting is good, whether you´re looking at Willis, or Pitt and Madeleine Stowe. The plot is excellent, although nothing tremendously original.WARNING: SOME OF THE NEXT WORDS MAY CONSTITUTE SPOILERS. WARNING: SOME OF THE NEXT WORDS MAY CONSTITUTE SPOILERS.Gillian created a post-apocalypse world that is horrible to contemplate, but very possible to come true. Making his character go back to the past, not knowing where he is going to end up, what society he will be put against, going through the trial and error task of getting to the exact point in time where the character should be in order to stop the ultimate cataclism, Gillian shows us the terrifying `reality' behind time travel, the risks involved in it, the possibility of a traveler going mad over it.You feel sorry for Bruce´s character, you go side by side with him in his struggle to leave the lunatics hospital and finally his struggle to stop the menace.There is mystery, strange discoveries, the skepticism of Stowe´s character, the dizziness in Willis´character´s struggles, a larger than life issue at stake (the salvation of mankind and the future), sacrifices and as usual, the irritating paradox of why would anyone try to remake the past (for whatever reason) when he/she would cease to exist as the person who fears and suffers and wants to change somethingThis movie does make one think about life, sacrifices, today´s madness, altruismIt´s dark, it does not offer hope, only despair and sadness, and brings many questions to life. It´s frightening, mad, and holds your attention from the beginning. But you do have to have an open mind and hope for the worst (in the story). Great movie. Very much anti-Hollywood, a Gillian´s usual.",9,0,0,23 August 1999
Dark City," One of the darkest stories ever told on movies
","Well, dark may be, but not violent. This is one of the strangest tales I´ve ever seen produced by the movie industry. It´s not of those flashy works that Hollywood seems so proud to give birth to again and again. It´s complex enough and has an atmosphere very similar to that which we find in Hitchcock´s films and Blade Runner.And once again, like in The Matrix, things are not what they appear to be. Kind of resembles the work produced by master science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick. In Dark City, you just wait, follow the hero, collect the information (well given) and mistrust what your eyes and conscious thoughts tell you.Dark City was not a huge success, but that, ironically, constitutes proof that it is a strange but good movie. Nowadays, most people, irrespective of their location in the world (USA, Europe, Asia), seem to be more at ease when they go to the cinema to see something like ID4 or Armaggedon than when they face a treasure like Dark City, Blade Runner or The Matrix. They complain (even critics) that these movies are too complicated or too subtle to be seen and understood in mere two hours. Talk about dramatic drops in IQ ratings...The special effects of Dark City are good enough and give credibility to the story. The plot could be more complex (as happens with The Matrix), but Hollywood standards demand that you, as director, should not make people think too much while watching the movie...or else...spectators will shy away from the movie.The acting is good. Rufus Sewell is good, Kiefer S. is even better, and mr. Hurt portrays an inspector with a rather grey life in a low profile personal performance. The strange 'Men in Black Overcoats' are really disgusting and scary to look at.The finale should have been more...bigger-than-life, one of those events that make you think about it long after you see it.I bought the video and watch it with delight, although I didn´t go to the cinema 4 times to see it, as happened with The Matrix and Blade Runner.All in all, a good movie, different, where the director had the guts to tell a story at a pace and in a way that most movies released nowadays will not show.",9,0,1,10 August 1999
The Game," A challenging game played with our expectations
","There is not much to be said about this strange and exciting picture. Although not a very original picture, the acting, together with good characterization and directing, makes The Game one of the most exciting moments in Cinema these days. Good plot, good twists and turns, a false finale, followed by sweet finale. Douglas is great (his usual self), Unger is average, Sean Penn is good, and the rest of the cast helps the story move along. ItÂ´s a form of thriller that touches the fringes of fantastic tales (such as the ones by Stephen King and Dean Koontz). A good movie, full of surprises, you get hooked to the characters and wait impatiently for the finale.",8,0,1,24 December 1999
The Insider," Inside a true story
","WHAT CAN WE SAY ABOUT A MOVIE BASED ON A TRUE STORY?Well, if the movie is any good, even if loosely based on that true story, not much can we say. Michael Mann has done a fantastic work. He throws the viewer into a voyage filled with constant tension, the hallmark of every good thriller. Ok, being based on a true story makes somewhat easier the job of the director - we can easily identify with the characters, because (that´s my case) we imagine ourselves in their shoes and think, 'Wow, what would I do if I were him/her?'The plot, full of twists, is frighteningly familiar to all of us with some sense of reality. That´s the real world, folks. Powerful men and institutions don´t give a dime about any of us, simple mortals. We are merely the tools they use to get richer and more powerful and that´s it.Once in a decade or so, and out of millions, comes someone who goes about his/her business with a tremendous sense of justice and righteousness. The Insider is about two of such persons, two men - whether or not the real story is exactly like that, it does not matter. But I have a feeling that whatever happenned in real life may very well be close to this movie.Al Pacino, as usual (I have no words to characterize his acting - superb, out of this world, to be remembered, the master of masters, someone who breathes acting like others breathe air), fantastic. He is older, one can see that, he looks a little bit tired, but what a tremendous performance this man has achieved.Mr. Russel Crowe...his performance is worth a nomination for an oscar. He is strong, fragile, cold, emotionally unstable, a loving father, a knight who fights for justice, knowledgeable, a good friend...what a character, and what a performance. He is the main emotional engine of this movie, and has made it big. He is a nominee for this year´s oscar, together with one of the greatest actors alive - Denzel Washington. He has a definite chance of winning this one, but it will be tough.The rest of the cast...Plummer, the great actor, is his usual self-centered man who goes nuts when someone 'screws' with him...pardon my english.Good soundtrack, also.I thank Michael Mann, the actors and the studio behind them, for bringing us (the public) their vision of the events surrounding the discovery that tobacco companies are playing with every smoker´s life...and everyone´s life, by the way. I haven´t yet seen the other movies nominated for Best Motion Picture Award, but The Insider seems like a good choice.Good movie. Good directing. Go see it.",9,0,0,17 February 2000
Titanic," The deep waters of Memory will never sink the fascination for Titanic
","Many critics (like the one in NBC, who got to the point of showing a cartoon with a ship sinking into the waters of failure), seemed certain that we would watch a new Titanic tragedy: overbudgeted, late release, etc... James Cameron never seemed to be one those men who dream of doing something no one dares doing and keep that dream alive...He never looked to be a dreamer. That´s the problem with most people, and directors and writers, nowadays. But...wow, was I wrong. He had a dream, he awaited the opportunity...and he did it.This Titanic movie has a greek tragedy dimension to it and also an epic proportion that most Titanic TV movies and Hollywood movies do not.You can´t help but feel very close to the characters, irrespective of their being historical or fictional. The soundtrack and the acting achieve something that, together with camera positioning and ship and costumes details, has put behind every documentary and film ever done on great disasters in History. Maybe someday, someone will try something similar with Pompei, or the Zeppelin...I doubt it.The storyline is too simple, but mr. Cameron had his hands on too much material (the abyss between upper classes and lower classes, the characters' final struggle, the replic of Titanic, the tragedy itself) to pay more attention to the plot. So, it´s predictable. So what?Unless you´re dead or you belong to a particular kind of person that considers feelings and the sense of loss something unimportant and unworthy of movie camera´s focus , you can´t help but go along with the character´s plight and fears... With good acting, good special effects, marvellous soundtrack, historical details...how can´t I put myself in the position of those 1600 people or so who lost their lives? Going through the movie, reaching the finale, I began thinking 'What if it was me, in Jack´s place, or the captain´s place, or the men and women below decks, or the men in the machine rooms?'The final scene of Titanic is a deserved and beautiful homage paid to those who survived those who die. It´s poetic and sweet, and somehow puts the souls of those who saw the movie at peace with History. Sometimes, Nature, the Cosmos, God, puts us to the test, and one of those tests took place in 1912. Beautiful and moving motion picture. Maybe it deserved another posture from Cameron at the Oscar Ceremony. Maybe Di Caprio deserved to be nominated... Great Titanic.",8,1,2,11 August 1999
Blade Runner," Do today´s directors dream of making a masterpiece like this?
","Yes, they do. A science-fiction writer-critic once complained that Blade Runner is one of the most over-rated movies, arguing that it quite doesn´t live up to the book written by Philip K. Dick. Well, yes, it´s not as complex as the book itself, but I beg to differ. Blade Runner is one of the most UNDER-RATED movies ever. Only science-fiction fans talk about it, thus the movie is looked upon with arrogance by other genre´s fans and critics.Blade Runner tries, -and accomplishes it-, to be sober, realistic and ironic. Mixing action with calm, steady exposition, it brings the viewer the full view of a post-apocalyptic society, ranging from the high classes to the street level lives of some characters.You get slowly into the movie, experiencing a strange and cold environment, full of hightech gadgets (TV scanners, Videophones, hover-cars, androids, artificial animals, lie-emotion detectors, etc), and watch a detective-mistery-action-love story develop under a very firm and knowledgeable hand (Ridley Scott´s). The mistery and menace portraid by the androids (one of the focus of the film) remains throughout, gripping the viewer until the very end.The characters are well developed, the plot is complex and has interesting twists. Sometimes you want the detective to finish his job in a determined way, eliminating the cold threats he has in front; at other times, you can´t help but feel strangely sad as the detective becomes the predator against the threat (namely, against the first android woman, as she runs for her life).The action may be a little slow, but one knows that when something out of the ordinary flow of events happens, then the screen becomes the place for something thrilling. Whatever happens, Blade Runner never gets too violent; it portrays a possible reality. Having many layers of plot and great depth only emphasizes the greatness of this movie, rendering it realistic, dense and thought-provoking. Emphasis is given to the universal quest of finding out who we are, and when does reality, -life-, terminate.The acting is very good, from a 'I´m forced to do this' attitude by Harrison Ford, to the ultra-sophistication of Sean Young. Rugter Hauer has one of his best performances ever, in this movie.The visual effects are good, even by today´s standards, making certain that the movie stays within 'realism' boundaries.It´s an intriguing, hypnotic movie. It does not offend the book, albeit being different from it. It´s worth seeing again and again, and, if you think of all the sequels happening with some movies (not referring to Star Wars, of course), well worth some kind of continuation (meaning, of course, sequel...). But I doubt this will ever happen. Maybe it´s best this way, who knows? Anyway, this movie is part of my big and wonderful movies constelation: Star Wars, Alien, Dark City, The Matrix. And for me, that´s all, folks!",10,0,0,20 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A JJ Abrams product: a solid buiding, empty inside
","JJ Abrams 'rebooted' Star Trek (he admitted to knowing ALMOST nothing about the Trek universe). Fanfare, box office hit. And he and his script writers almost destroyed what Roddenberry, Braga and others did through the years.Now he was given Star Wars. Of which he said he was a fan. Doubtful, as he final result is filled with 21st Century Hollywood clichés (ridiculous one-line jokes which destroy suspension of disbelief; Beverly Hills style of TV characters and their pathetic body language; louder-and-bigger perspective, reminiscent of Dean Devlin's philosophy)...and is utterly, sadly predictable.****Slight hints of SPOILERS ahead**** Why would George Lucas (already super-rich and super-powerful) relinquish his rights on Star Wars and deliver them to Disney/Abrams...is beyond me. He must have known that the end result would be a pastiche of different action movies/series, unimaginative, incoherent, though massive doses of popcorn consumption level of box office success.George Lucas is to blame. JJ Abrams is not talented enough for the job, but that is the way he works, the way he is. By letting go of his 'child', Lucas left it for the sharks to feed off of it (though I doubt this 'episode' will reach anywhere near Cameron's Avatar box office heights).What's left to say? Daisy Ridley, powerful actress and physically perfect for the job. She alone can hold the franchise above water.Han Solo. Harrison Ford is...Harrison Ford, and his character is a good one for the ages.BB8, C3P0, R2D2 - The good old droids are back, and are joined by a lovable little droid.Chewbacca - fun and lovable as always.Poe Dameron and General Hux - good characters, good acting behind them (Domhnall Gleeson has a classic hateful Empire demeanour).Most important of all, with 'episode' VII there comes a promise of potentially good Star Wars universe movies to follow (Rogue One and VIII and IX).We shall see...as long as JJ Abrams and his clones keep their hands off of it.",6,3,13,22 December 2015
The Matrix," Like Alice, if you follow the white rabbit you´ll end up in...The Matrix.
","Science-fiction is an art form, whether you write it or make a movie based on it. 2001, 2010, Star Wars, Blade Runner, Alien, Dark City: all these are examples of the finest art in the movie industry. Now I add to this small list The Matrix.The Matrix´s Plot is complex and equally simple. It envolves you right from the beginning. You (the viewer), get hints in a sparingly way, just as in the best Octavia Butler´s sci-fi novels. The exposition, both visual and verbal, is stunningly well done. It shines as a rare case of equilibrium between the need to inform and the need to capture the spectator´s attention.Now, all this should be enough to make it a good movie. But there is more: the fighting scenes, the special effects, the sound effects, the soundtrack...and the acting. The Brothers got it right, whatever the angle from which you look at the movie. It´s non-stop action together with a intelligent storyline.The fighting scenes were beautifully choreographed, and the camera´s movement and positioning, following hints from japanese anime, is vivid and dramatic. For instance, helped by the camera and special effects wizards, Carrie Ann´s movements were simply fantastic, all the more if you consider the fact that she was once a model. Technological wizardry and personal physical accomplishment well merged.You will see some magnificent visual effects, but the sound effects surely top those by more than a notch or two. The Brothers could have followed a Devlin-Emmerich (ID4) type of philosophy - bigger, louder, etc -, but they refrained from that...well, there´s only one scene where they wrecked the balance sound-action-music ... I´ll leave it to you to discover what scene I´m referring to.The soundtrack is almost hypnotic, it helps the plot along, it kind of makes the characters move forward, builds their emotions...and also ours. Some movies alienate the viewer with some too agressive music and instrumentation, but The Matrix´s soundtrack is perfect, made to-the-point.Keanu Reeves and the rest of the cast...well, two words for them all: great acting. There is not a single moment in the whole movie where you think to yourself: '0h, weak, fragile acting as usual...' Everybody, from mr. Reeves to Ray Anthony Parker, knows their place and what they are supposed to do exactly to the millimeter. They convince us that they(the characters) are real.If you think of Blade Runner´s action and environment, or Dark City´s storyline and atmosphere, you think of dense and coherent facts, not flashy or shocking to the point of nausea (like ID4 or Aliens IV), but solid and attention graber...that´s the case with The Matrix. While scary, The Matrix´s universe is an epic and brave one.The Matrix: intelligent, thought-provoking, exciting, vivid, innovative and dramatic film-making. You´ll love it. I did.",10,0,0,9 August 1999
