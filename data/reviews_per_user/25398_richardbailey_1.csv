Scarface," What can I say
",This film is truly the template of all Gangster style movies Circa 1980's (and even now). Al Pacino take the role in his stride as Montana and the rest of the cast were an excellent choice.  This should be watched by somebody who has not seen the movie before so that they can analyse and see where most of today films have copied their ideas from.,10,0,1,13 February 2004
