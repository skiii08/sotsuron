The Young Victoria," Amazing
","I saw this on the big screen and was encapsulated with it. The period of Queen Victoria's younger years are a mystery and this is a perfect description of how a young girl was thrusted into one of the highest roles in the world.The script is perfect, the acting is amazing, the history and attention to detail is out of this world. Emily Blunt is perfect as Victoria. Funny how her mother is played by Elizabeth the 1st and William IV is played by Prince Albert! (Think Blackadder).This portrayal of Victoria shows that she was a rebellious young woman once - I'm sure she would have been on Jeremey Kyle Show if it had been around then: 'My mother and her boyfriend are trying to steal my life'.A Perfect piece of a major part of British and Commonwealth history.",10,2,4,18 July 2009
Catch Me If You Can," This is worth an 11
","I first rented this back in 2004 and thought id give it a go. Now, in 2008, I'm hooked on the story.This is based on a true story of Frank Abagnale, who became one of Americas daring con men. The story is addictive. He gets up to all sorts posing in a variety of different professions to get by and escape the authorities who are after him as he keeps forging cheques (checks). The antics he gets up to are astonishing as i think many people wouldn't have the nerve to do them - This has taught me a lot about cheque fraud and counterfeiting. Grab this and the book of the same name. Its amazing in what a young man will do to survive.",10,1,3,24 June 2008
Pirate Radio," This Rocks - See it!!!!
","I'm writing this an hour after just seeing it and my god what a film. This film ROCKS!!!!!It had the cinema in stitches, the story and plot were there (unlike in a popular film thats just been released on DVD) characters believable and likable - even the ones who do wrong.I'm not going to spoil this for anyone by saying what happens, OK its a pirate radio station in the time when they were about and music radio was next to nothing on the legal wavelengths. I say WATCH IT!!!! 2 hours of quality film entertainment!!!!! Roll on when the DVD is out, its on my list already.This is an 11 out of 10, Oscar & BAFTA time definitely.",10,15,24,7 April 2009
Quantum of Solace," What the hell is going on?
","I've bought this on DVD and I'm glad I have. The only reason I'm glad is that I can watch it again and again and see if I can find the plot anywhere. Watched it twice so far and still can't work out whats going on. The credits rolled and I thought: 'Is that it?' 97 minutes were on the clock of the DVD Player.This is a continuation of Casino Royale and I'm not sure how to describe the film. It starts in Italy, goes to Haiti and then Bolivia. Some bloke is after oil or water? I'm still confused. If you like action without dialogue, you got it. I'm sure the total script wouldn't cover two sides of A4 paper.The title song, I'm sorry to say, has to be one of the worst and has no relation to the film or a mood connection either. This isn't the best and not the worst. Please lets have something better next time, keep it to the 2 hour mark and please lets have a plot and dialogue.",5,22,32,27 March 2009
2012," typical American disaster movie
","4 and its only getting that for the special effects and the Russian girl.The film started at 12:30 and I nearly walked out because of the cheese at 1:45. As with most disaster films that threaten the world, this one is right out of the rule book and only happens in America. Turns out the Mayan civilisation many years ago worked out the world would end because of a solar flare. The same solar flare disrupts the workings of the earth and the crust moves about a bit. Great special effects. Typical divorced family unit where the father forgets everything and they get back together at the end when the mothers boyfriend is killed (wont say how as it will spoil it) So with the earth now moving about a bit, the north pole ends up where I wonder? oh yeah Wisconsin right slap bang in the middle of the US as these things only happen to the US. Getting to the bit where I nearly left; the president sits down in the white house (or whats left of it) saying 'my fellow Americans this is the most catastrophic event to happen to our nation' Right what about the rest of the world? Are we all lying in the sun having a smoke and a beer? I was actually expecting this after watching other of Mr Emmerich's creations and he delivered. Disaster movie, only affecting the USA, minor glimpses of the rest of the world, might end up somewhere that we don't see. If this does happen, I'm booking my holiday (vacation) on the US/Mexico border for Christmas 2012",4,0,2,17 November 2009
