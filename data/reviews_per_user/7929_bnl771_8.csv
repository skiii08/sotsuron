The Ring," Truly Terrifying
","Gore Verbinski (The Mexican, Mouse Hunt) has run with his first opportunity at making a horror movie and, in the process, handed fans of the genre a taught, suspense filled thriller with brains and scares. The movie opens with what has become an obligatory `opening scare' that involves two girls, Katie and Becca, scaring each other with talk of a videotape. The tape, it seems, is cursed and after the viewer watches it, he or she receives a call explaining his or her fate: death will come in seven days. Kate admits that she has seen the tape. In a scene of brilliant tension, this opener takes us through Katie's final minutes; it has been exactly seven days to the hour since she has seen the tape.We are then introduced to Katie's cousin, Aidan, and her aunt, Rachel Keller (played by Naomi Watts, Mulholland Dr.). Rachel is a newspaper reporter and, at Katie's wake, begins a search for the cause of Katie's death. Rachel learns of the cursed videotape and is quickly tangled in the mystery. Her detective work leads her to Shelter Mountain Inn where she watches the video tape and receives the legendary call. `Seven days,' she is told, and the count down begins.Rachel and friend Noah (who also watches the tape) work together to discover the origins of the tape. The hints are many and varied and, at first, don't seem to add up to much. There are horses, a lighthouse and a family called the Morgans. How they are linked and what they have to do with the videotape, I will never tell. Midway through the film, the urgency the investigation carries is increased and the ramifications of the reality of the urban legend are amplified.The movie is expertly directed. There's a drenching rain to many of the scenes and even when the weather clears up, their remains a wetness of dread. The colors are subdued except for a red that figures prominently into the story. Overall, Verbinski has shown his talent in droves here, successfully keeping the pace taught, the visuals interesting and the tensions paramount.The acting is great across the board. Some mention was made of the performance of the young boy, but I found him to be quite charming and much better than many child actors. Naomi Watts does well (even if she is handed some questionable lines) and very much shows her versatility of the actress. Her work here is completely different than knockout performance in Mulholland Dr..The only problem I found with the movie is that, taken in a series of unnerving parts, there are some moments that feel very familiar. The film borrows heavily from other popular horror films. Aside from this, however, the sum of the parts shines as an excellent horror film.
This film has a long history. It is a remake of a Japanese film, Ringu, which is an adaptation of a book. I have seen Ringu and find that film to be slightly scarier, though lacking in plot. The Ring fleshes out the story and accurately recreates the impending dread of the original film. This movie is a genre fan's dream: a suspenseful, smart horror movie that, as a whole, is highly original. The Ring make no attempt to spoon feed the audience and leaves the viewer to connect the dots.",Null,1,1,4 March 2004
Final Destination 2," Death Strikes... again?
","It has been a year since the terrifying disaster of flight 180 and the discussion of what caused the strange deaths of those that escaped the crash lingers on. On this anniversary of the flight, Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook) and her friends are disembarking on a Spring Break road trip. However, Kimberly is about to experience the unthinkable. In a vision that is harrowing to watch, the audience is treated to the most gruesome and realistic highway pileup ever committed to film. Anyone who is already afraid of the dangers of being on the road would do well to cover their eyes during some of this scene.As with Alex Browning in the first film, Kimberly is only experiencing a vision of what is about to happen. It is up to her to try to stop the lives of innocent people around her from coming to an end on that road. She decides to stop traffic from merging onto the highway and, in doing so, allows another group of people to cheat death. Among this colorful collection of characters is Office Thomas Burke (Michael Landes) who becomes the first to believe Kimberly and becomes her partner in crime (so to speak) as she begins the race to try to understand deaths design and how to bring the process to an end. As in the first movie, of course, those who cheated death begin to die in creative, unexpected and gruesome ways.
The plot here is so very simple that it only works to the movie's benefit that it is not always the focus. The clear reason individuals go to see a Final Destination film is obviously the death sequences. I am happy to say this film delivers in spades. The deaths here are harrowing and gruesome and every bit as imaginative as the first. All the actors here are above decent and add a strange bit of credibility to the ridiculousness of the film. The direction in the film is great and is ingenious in the tactics used to make sure even those who want to turn away at the gruesome moments are forced to share in some of the gory glory.Through the film we see the return of a single character from the first film. Clear Rivers (Ali Larter) has locked herself away in a padded room to keep herself safe from death. Kimberly convinces Clear to help stop this new chain of events. Along the way, we also learn about Alex Browning's (Devon Sawa in the first film) ultimate fate. All in all, this film does an admirable job of building some suspense while not taking itself too seriously. Final Destination 2 also comes up with a clever way to tie itself to the first. This is a decent, fun follow up that does not really add anything to the mix but should be an enjoyable viewing for any fan of the first.",Null,0,0,4 March 2004
The Bourne Identity," Popcorn flick with some brains
","The Bourne Identity opens with a body floating in the water. We view this body from underneath, through the water, as intermittent flashes of lighting give it definition. Soon, the stranger is picked up by a fishing vessel and, here, two bullets are removed from his back. A laser-pointer containing a Swiss bank safe-box number is removed from his hip.The stranger travels to Zurich to retrieve the contents of the safe-box. He finds a bench to sleep on and when prodded by police, he takes them out in a quick series of punches and kicks that surprise even him. Inside the deposit box, he finds all the items needed to be a figure of international intrigue. Inside he discovers his name: Jason Bourne. Other items include passports from several countries, a collection of world currencies as well as a gun. Bourne collects these items (sans the gun) and leaves that bank. He is followed to the US Embassy where the action begins.Inside the American Embassy in Zurich we get our first view of Marie played excellently by Franka Potente (Run Lola Run, The Princess and the Warrior). Bourne takes notice, but continues on as he is being pursued. When cornered, Bourne once again finds himself to be a lean, mean fighting machine by taking out several security cards without a second thought. Bourne makes an escape from the embassy that is a nail-biting cinematic experience. This scene, which was free from music or any other distractions, solidified the director's talent in my mind. This guy is good.Outside the embassy, Bourne runs into Marie yet again. He offers her money in return for a ride to Paris (where Jason Bourne lives). Marie agrees and together they go forward to unravel the mystery. Along the way, we are treated to a glimpse inside the CIA as a man by the name of Conklin (Chris Cooper) begins to track down Bourne.The film flows briskly and is full of human moments that raised it to a level above and beyond what your typical action film rests at. The casting is excellent across the board (although the use of Julia Stiles seems to have been a waste). The direction, as said before, is excellent. The music adds to the film. Overall, this is first and foremost is a drama about a man trying to discover not only WHO he is, but WHY he is. His past is the only way he can figure out what his future should be.The film's only flaw is that when we finally figure it all out, it's nowhere near as exciting as the journey there. With such tight drama, carefully executed and believable action (including a nail-biting, classic-style car chase through Paris) one would expect a simple, yet satisfying ending. While we get both, it is just not enough. This flaw, though, is not enough to justify not seeing the film. It is an intelligent, fun ride that demands at least one viewing.",Null,0,1,4 March 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," The Machines Rise Indeed
","Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was a project that had nothing going for it. Without James Cameron behind the camera (or involved in any way at all), many thought the project was doomed from day one. With a new director, Jonathan Mostow (U-571), a new John Connor, Nick Stahl (Bully), and a story that seemed like a rehash of Terminator 2: Judgment Day it seemed that the naysayers would be right. I am pleased to say that they were only half correct about this film.Ten years after John and Sarah Connor, with the help of a friendlier T-800, were able to stop the T-1000 and Judgment Day, John is in hiding. His fears prove to be well-founded as another, later model terminator, the T-X (the smashingly gorgeous Kristanna Loken), travels back to 2003 with a new mission. In the midst of the chaos, John meets Kate Brewster (Claire Danes of My So-Called Life fame), and it seems that their meeting at this time is not so much coincidence. A T-800 (Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger) leads John and Kate on a journey to learn the truth behind Judgement Day and to stop the T-X.Terminator 3 is not the bomb that many thought it was going to be. Mostow is wise enough to keep the tone and the look of the movie close enough to Cameron's style as to not alienate this film from the rest of the series. He does, however, throw enough of his own flair into the mix that we do not feel we are watching an exact replica of Judgment Day. There are scenes of action in this film that are simply breathtaking to behold. Not thirty minutes into the movie one of the greatest scenes of vehicular mass destruction takes places and the movie rarely lets up until the end. The film begins to border ridiculousness in the action arena when you begin to notice that something blows up every ten to fifteen minutes. Fortunately, however, each and every action scene is a joy to watch.
The actors here are all very strong. Schwarzenegger and Loken are both excellent in their parts. Arnold would have had no excuse to not play a perfect terminator; the real worry lay with the ability of Loken, a virtual unknown, to carry such a heavy role. Loken is a real delight as the T-X with her ability to create small moments with only her head and face movements. Nick Stahl is believable as John Connor and does a good job throughout. Claire Danes is decent in her role though she would qualify as the weakest link amongst the cast.The real problem with the movie is the script. As hard as it tries, the story here is nothing we haven't seen from a Terminator film. Its good terminator versus bad terminator premise was carried out to much greater effect ten years ago with Judgment Day. The time-travel aspect and inherent paradoxes therein reach a new level of confusion in this film as both terminators have unnatural knowledge of each other's movements from the very beginning and the audience is left to wonder why this movie needed to be created after the finality of the last film. Also, there is far too much goofiness involving Arnold's terminator. Where Terminator 2 used carefully placed and crafted bits of humor to showcase the small bit of humanity contained within the machine, Terminator 3 uses the terminator as ludicrous comic relief when none is needed. Finally, the much talked about ending is admittedly a little weak and underwhelming in light of the rest of the film.
There is no escaping comparison to the two films that came before Rise of the Machines. The first two in the trilogy are true examples of modern classics. While Terminator 3 tries its best, it is by far the weakest of the series. The admirable job done by the cast and crew to ensure this films place in the series, however, is to be commended. With less brains and more popcorn value, this film should satisfy most fans of the action filled saga.",Null,0,0,4 March 2004
28 Days Later...," Infectious
","Before any real review of this movie can be done, there needs to be some clarification on the genre of the picture. The film was marketed as pure horror in the United States. While this angle definitely worked to pack the theaters, it was not a completely accurate summation of the nature of the movie. The movie is first and foremost a post-apocalyptic drama. There are horror aspects, yes, but it is not a scare-a-minute zombie film by any means. This distinction is what makes the film so great.
A group of animal rights activists raid a primate research lab. In doing so, they release an infection that turns its victims into raging murderers. The infection is carried in blood and will infect a person in less than thirty seconds. A brutal opening to the movie leads into the haunting title of the movie and takes us ahead 28 days later when we meet our hero, Jim (Cillian Murphy).Jim, a bicycle courier involved in an accident the day the infection was released, has just awoken from a comatose state. As Jim begins to discover that he is quite possibly alone in London, the audience is treated to dazzling shots of an empty, abandoned city. This sequence also highlights perfectly the amazing use of music found throughout the film.
Jim eventually finds himself under the care of two other survivors. Mark (Noah Huntley) and Selena (Naomie Harris) have been living on the run and have managed to stay alive. It is Selena who explains to Jim that the world as he knew it the day of his accident is gone. Everyone she, Mark and Jim have known and loved is dead and anyone left alive is left to run from the infected that roam free. The group makes its way to Jim's home and there is an extremely touching series of scenes that take place.
Jim also meets a father and daughter pair. The father, Frank (Brendan Gleeson), and daughter, Hannah, have caught a signal from an army officer that proclaims an end to infection. As the group sets off to find these soldiers the movie takes its first major shift in tone as it becomes a road movie for a bit. There will be one more shift in tone after the road trip is over, but it is this tone that most will find surprising and the acceptance of the change of events in the movie is what will determine if you enjoy the movie or not.I found this movie to be brilliant for unusual reasons. The script itself is nothing new, amazing or all the clever in itself. What makes the movie work so well is a combination of the paranoia found in the first and last sections of the movie, excellent actors that bring a scary sense of believability to the screen and the use of digital video to enhance the raw nature of the events onscreen. Danny Boyle has been, for my money, a very hit or miss director, but has always managed to bring clever and ultimately engaging images to the screen. In 28 Days Later, Boyle takes his digital images and enhances them to make almost every shot memorable. This, combined with several fine examples of how to use music to enhance emotion, makes for a film that goes above and beyond its source material to create more of an experience than a film.28 Days Later was mainly faulted for its third act and its theatrical ending. The third act takes a turn as the group of survivors end their road trip and meet up with the soldiers claiming to have the answer to infection. While this is an unexpected direction for the movie, I don't fault the film for it. The scenes found in this final section of the film contain the best dialogue and some quality horror elements. I may also be one of the few that actually enjoyed the ending as seen in the theaters. I do, however, understand and am frustrated by a few unanswered questions.",Null,1,2,4 March 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Second part of the best trilogy ever made
","The movie opens with a return to Moria where Gandalf and the Balrog are at a standoff. This familiar scene, however, takes a new twist and instead of following the remainder of the fellowship to their grief, we follow Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellan) into the forgotten chasms below even Moria. Before we can learn his ultimate fate, we are brought back to where we left off in The Fellowship of the Ring.Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) have made little progress on their trek towards Mordor where they must return the one ring to the fiery pits from whence it came. Frodo is falling more and more under the control of the ring and the spirits of both of the hobbits is waning in light of the incredible length of the journey thus far and the unknown distance they must still travel. It is not long, though, before they run into the ring's owner prior to Bilbo- Gollum.Gollum is a wonder to behold. Every bit of hype about the complexity, believability and dramatic effect of this digital character is deserved. As in the books, Gollum is an immensely important character to the movies and there was no room for error when presenting him onscreen. As he continues on the journey with Frodo and Sam, Gollum continues to be a dramatic entity like none other and his motives are never entirely clear.
Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) are hot on the trail of Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd). As you may recall, the two hobbits were captured and whisked away by the evil Uruk-Hai. The trail leads the three into the land of Rohan which is in turmoil under the weak leader ship of King Theoden. Theoden is a thin shadow of his previous self, we learn, and we discover this situation is not what it seems. Through the help of the malicious Grima Wormtounge (Brad Dourif), Saruman (Christopher Lee) has gained control of Theoden in order to weaken the kingdom of Rohan to insure its defeat in the war waged by Sauron.Merry and Pippin, it turns out, have escaped the Uruk-Hai but have come under the control of another, less malicious force- an ent by the name of Treebeard (voiced by John Rhys-Davis). Treebeard is a walking, talking tree that, at first, mistakes the hobbits for orcs. This storyline is the weakest and was the most cut up of the plot lines. It will be restored in the upcoming extended edition however.This movie is an epic in itself and the plot outlined above all unfolds in the first 45 minutes of the three hour film. Needless to say, you should not, under any circumstances, attempt to watch this film without seeing The Fellowship of the Ring. Peter Jackson made the genius decision to pickup in this film where the first left off and spends absolutely no time recapping the previous adventures of these characters. Instead, he fills the entire three hours with new plot, more character driven story and epic adventure and action. The whole film culminates in the most viscerally engaging and technically detailed on-screen battle ever witness. The battle of Helm's Deep will most likely leave you breathless.Jackson and his crew have crafted a living universe here. Every costume, every weapon, every plant and every creature looks as if it belongs. This is Middle-earth. The cinematography is darker in this film (due to the obvious shift in tone) and the direction and camera work is just as gorgeous as in the first film. There are no weak links in the chain of actors that have been asked to bring the characters of Middle-earth alive. Each and everyone lives and breathes their characters.What The Lord of the Rings series comes down to is a masterfully epic story about a hobbit. While these movies could have been overwhelmed by special effects and CGI, Jackson understands the soul of the books were not in the creatures and the battles, but in the characters that have to do things that go against their very nature in order to bring harmony back into their world. The Two Towers is a perfect middle section to this trilogy and, like The Fellowship of the Ring, leaves us with a cliff-hanger and a good reason to go see the next film. When all is said and done, these three films will forever be discussed as part of film history.",Null,0,0,4 March 2004
Gangs of New York," Fails to overly impress
","Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) and William `The Butcher' Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) are the two central characters in Gangs of New York. Amsterdam lost his father in fight between the Irish immigrants and the Native Americans (who are not American Indians). During the opening battle scene (which plays, unfortunately, as if it were directed by some MTV rookie), Bill the Butcher takes the life of `Priest' Vallon (Liam Neeson). Only a young boy, Amsterdam is sent away to a reform school where he anxiously awaits the chance to take revenge.The movie picks up in 1863 as an older Amsterdam returns to the savagely impoverished Five Points area of Manhattan. He immediately begins to seek out Bill the Butcher in order to exact revenge. It is this period of the movie that is the best. Amsterdam is still a young man, albeit a hardened young man. Through necessity, he makes friends with some of the most unlikely people and we are left to make our own assumptions of some individuals' motives. Amsterdam meets Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz) and their relationship during this period of the movie is brilliant.
Gangs of New York takes a turn for the worse in the third act. Instead of continuing to focus on the intricate character relationships that it so masterfully and carefully setup through the first 2 acts, the movie decides to become a historical drama centering on the Draft Riots. While the Draft Riots are an important and mostly forgotten piece of history, the audience has invested too much time into the existing micro-relationships for the movie to simply push them into the backseat. The events leading up the riots had always been in the background of Gangs and I was comfortable with them there.The movie is beautifully filmed for the most part. As mentioned above, the opening fight sequence was strange and had an MTV quality that initially left a bad taste in my mouth. Fortunately, Scorcese finds a tone and style that remains effective and, in some sequences, is almost brilliantly conceived. All of the actors here are superb and, if you can get past Leonard DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz as 19th century hooligans, you will enjoy their performances much more. The real star here, however, is Daniel Day-Lewis. He is not playing Bill the Butcher, the man is Bill the Butcher. He plays Bill with such an intensity, I never once questioned his existence. The music in the film is hardly anything special and works effectively where it needs to accentuate emotion. The set design and costume work is top-notch.Overall, Gangs of New York is a welcome addition to my collection as it should be in yours. The shift in focus is unsettling, but does not diminish the accomplishments of the revenge story in the long run. The movie would have worked either a straight character drama or a historical drama about the Draft Riots. It does not, however, completely flow as both. Each of the parts of the film are exciting in their own rights but only succeeded in distracting one part from the other. Scorcese has crafted a fine tale and, while not the masterpiece or even Best Picture candidate it was touted as, Gangs of New York is a very good film.",Null,11,20,4 March 2004
Donnie Darko," A masterpiece of the indie film scene
","Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) lives in a quiet suburban town called Middlesex. We enter his story during what seems to be a typical family dinner. Set brilliantly in 1988, the movie opens with a reference to the Presidential race, with Donnie's sister (played by Jake's real life sister, Maggie Gyllenhaal) announcing her support for Dukakas. What ensues is a heated family debate. The head of the family, Eddie Darko (Holmes Osborne) and his wife Rose (Mary McDonnell) seem to have little control over their children at the dinner table as argument persists and expletives fly. We soon learn that Donnie is not only on medication but seeing a psychiatrist. Rounding out the Darko family is the young, adorable Samantha (Daveigh Chase).The audience is quickly drawn into Donnie's mind as we experience his first encounter with the six foot tall talking rabbit Frank (James Duvall). Frank carries a message concerning the end of the world. Having lead Donnie to a local golf course, he gives Donnie the exact number of days, hours, minutes and seconds until the universe's demise.When Donnie awakes the following morning with the course owner and Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze) looming over him, he quickly stumbles home. As he approaches his home, he realizes that, over night, it has become the scene of a disaster narrowly avoided. For reasons unbeknownst to anyone, including the FAA, a jet engine has fallen through the Darko's roof and straight through Donnie's bed. What follows this incident is Donnie's struggle to understand why this has happened, what is going to happen next, why Frank has chosen him and to answer many, many questions that have complicated answers.While this may sound overly complicated (and be sure that it is not easy to figure out), there are several characters along the way that add pieces to the puzzle. There's the new girl in school, Gretchen (Jena Malone) who begins a romantic fling with Donnie; there's the annoying gym teacher Mrs. Farmer (Beth Grant) who reports Donnie's behavior to the principal; there Donnie's English teacher Ms. Pomeroy (Drew Barrymore) and his Science teacher Professor Monnitoff (Noah Wiley) who both introduce clues that will be largely beneficial. Every single one of these characters, amongst others, is vitally important to understanding the complex story at work.
As Frank plants the ideas of time travel in Donnie's head, the viewer is forced to constantly question everything he or she has concluded up to a certain point. Donnie is involved in some criminal activity while following Frank. All of this leads to new discoveries. Nothing is a coincidence in this movie. And nothing is exactly what it seems.Is Donnie insane? Well, I can answer that one way and you could, after watching, answer it another and we could both be right. The beauty of this film, which defies classification, is that it seamlessly blends many genres to tell a story that is entirely new. It would surprise me to find someone who could honestly say they `got' the entire meaning of the movie on first viewing. There is a definite satisfaction when you watch it for the first time, but it requires several viewings to uncover the many rich layers.",10,0,1,4 March 2004
