The Rock," Weird feeling.
",I couldnt find anything perticular wrong with this movie. But it wasnt really great either. It was entertaining though.,6,1,3,30 June 2019
The Terminator," Tension build up on a higher level.
","The Terminator is a great movie according to me. The tension build up for the scenes are executed extremely well. The movie hints with similar but subtle choices of scene blocking, and soundtrack at different parts of the movie to create a form of dramatic tension.The story is interesting and the symbolism that lies under it. The symbolism can be found both in visual gags and in the story concept. Example: Bill Paxton's character has a tire track mark as a tattoo on his face. This mirrors the scene from the future war were a Machine Tank drives over a stack of human skulls. And what happens? Bill's character gets figuratively driven over by the machines. (He gets killed by The Terminator).The visual effects works for all but maybe one scene. The close up of The Terminator's face just before he puts on his famous sunglasses (to hide his now visible robot eye), looks kind of too dummy looking. The rest of the effects works great. The context helps some of the effects. Like that the Terminator skeleton's walking style is a bit weird. They added a concept of which that the Terminator was damaged in the foot. Which in universe makes the weird walking style more appealing. The movie follows the Chekhov's gun principle in many ways. There is nothing wrong with filler details though. This movie is good at planting such Chekhov objects. Some require multiple viewings to notice.Things the movie did right: The plot, both overall and subplots. The love story. The soundtrack. The technique used for tension building. The less is more editing. Multiple minor gags that I find entertaining. Hidden symbolism.Things the movie could have done better: The close up of the dummy Terminator face could have been shot differently for more belief. They should have kept the deleted scene at the end. 10/10",9,1,1,13 July 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Be careful what you wish for.
","You might aswell just get it.
It feels like they kind of painted themselves into a corner in the 2 last movies. This movie felt like they just said 'You know what? Lets give the fans exactly what they wanted!' And the fans dont know that what they want doesnt make a good movie.This movie felt a bit like a fan fic or some anime. (The final battle between Rey and Palpatine + the ending anyone?)You know that bad feeling you got when Disney first bought Star Wars. This movie is what you imagined back then.+ The sound effects of the lightsaber humming was good.
+ I was actually kept at the edge of my seat, I wanted to know what happend next. I barely touched my snacks, so the pacing was good like an action movie. A different pacing wouldnt have served the film they were making here.<ul><li>Some of the fanbase. 'Rian Johnson touched Mark's shoulder, how dareeee he?!' kind of fanbase. This has gotten out of hand.</li></ul>",6,1,4,19 December 2019
Pearl Harbor," Cool action scenes.
","Cool action scenes but the rest is on kind of average summer block buster level. The cinematography is interesting to study. I find a lot in this movie interesting to study in regards to how it was made, so that is a good thing about this movie.",6,0,2,25 July 2018
Alien: Covenant," Good summer blockbuster.
","Alien Covenant is a good summer blockbuster movie according to me. It had a fair amount of nods to the previous Alien movies, and also some to Ridley Scott's other works.The visual/special effects in the movie are what you can expect from a summer blockbuster. It looked like they added some extra grain to some shots in the movie, in old school sci-fi fashion.Some scenes are predictable. Some are less predictable. I would say that if you consider yourself good at spotting potential outcomes of events in movies. This film is not that twisting. But for average viewers, you might be surprised a couple of times watching this movie.It is not a new masterpiece, but definitely an above average good summer blockbuster worth watching if you like sci-fi horror.",6,0,6,17 May 2017
