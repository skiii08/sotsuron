Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," IMO, a clever but crude movie, overall in poor taste
","My opinion may be a minority one, but I did not enjoy this movie. It was rude, crude, and not all that funny. I don't think it is all that hard to get people to say ignorant things, if you approach them in a friendly manner and ask for some help. I'm not defending all the victims of this movie (yes, the people he interviewed are all victims of Sasha Cohen's con job), but I personally feel that this movie was very exploitive. I feel that, in an odd way, this movie says more about Americans' kindness and sense of charity, as well as naivet√©, than about prejudice and excessive nationalism. This movie mocks many people, and is needlessly graphic. IMO, if you are looking for a crude but funny skewering of American culture, watch South Park.",4,1,2,1 April 2007
The Man Who Would Be King," Wanted to like this movie...
","Unfortunately, I did not. I personally hate most of the postings that go 'why does anyone like this movie??!!' I understand that many people like this movie, but if you have not seen it, be aware that, though the movie is in English, you had better have your subtitles on to understand what is being said (HEAVY accents). Further, though the acting was not shabby, I guess I was not as impressed by the performances as many others were. I understand that most movies require a certain suspension of disbelief. However, this movie had SO MANY bizarre coincidences that I could not stomach it (avalanche scene, rationale for not wanting a character to marry, and MANY actions of the priests). The cinematography was stunning at times, but the effect was often undone with loud and pretentious music in the background. I really cannot comprehend how this film got 4 Oscar nominations. Anyway, be aware that many others feel this movie was under-rated and under-recognized by the Academy. See it, and decide for yourself!",6,5,19,18 March 2012
