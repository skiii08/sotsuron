Hereditary," Instant classic
","Let me say first and foremost that this film will let down many modern or contemporary horror fans. Many fans introduced to the genre since the late 90s into the Millennium might not appreciate this type of scary movie. Movies have conditioned us in recent years that blood and cheap scares are the only effective ways to scare us. The Director does throw in some 'jumpscare' type moments though. This is not 'Insidious' or the 'Evil Dead' remake. Do yourself a favor and skip this and wait for the new 'Purge' movie if that's what you are after (and I love those types of movies as well just to be clear.) They are fun films and usually leave me filled with 'hell yea' moments. This film left me with the 'what did I just watch' 
Toni Collette delivers the performace of her career in this film as 'Annie' the Mother of thr family. Let me take a moment to brag on Toni. She is by far the most underrated actress in the business right now. She stole my heart with her part in 'Krampus' as the Mother of that movie as well. She is so raw in this movie it's truly amazing. Toni delivers one of the most gut wrenching performances in movie history with this one. If she is not up for 'best actress' at this years Oscars I will be so angry.The rest of this very small cast of this movie is phenomenal. Milly Shapiro as the Daughter with a dead stare like a rock will break you mentally in ways you're not accustomed. Gabriel Byrne does a nice job with his character of 'Steve' the father trying to keep the family together as turmoil unfolds. Alex Wolff steals the show as the stoned teenage son who looks like he hates the world and everything in it. You know normal 16 year old stuff. Be prepared to see the face of Alex Wolff in many films to come. What this movie does so well is what i call the 'roller coaster effect' the first 30 minutes are the upward climb 'click click click click'. The next 30 minutes is the big drop, you feel your stomach in your throat. And then BAM the last hour is loops and swoops and turns and drops and holy mother of all that is good this movie is a ride! I will say the imagery will leave you breathless in scenes. The score had my hair standing up the whole movie. This film really excels in the cinematography department. Visually unlike anything any viewer has ever scene. Truly original plot. What else can i say? I literally had no negative complaints of this movie other than the ending....but it's a really great ending. It just punched me in the chest and ripped my soul out of my body but no big deal.'Hereditary' deliver several of the most horrifying and shocking scenes that I have ever witnessed. Big time 'i didn't see that coming' moments. Top ten horror movie of all time in my opinion.",10,6,15,10 June 2018
