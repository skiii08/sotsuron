The Ring," Not bad at all!
","I've been a fan of the original Ring (Ringu here), and sure The Ring doesn't meet up to the quality of the original, but this is still a solid horror movie and an adaptation if you want to compare.Ringu drew the horror with its intense mood (rather than shock/jumping scenes), and The Ring doesn't fail at doing it either. Acting is solid, and the music is as creepy as the original. It is definitely a 'different' type of horror movie than the traditional American 'slasher' films, and I'm sure both horror movie fans and non-horror movie fans can enjoy (and be scared) this film.The downside is that the plot was almost as I expected, leaving me with nothing new to take away. I guess its unfair to judge it this way, since it is an adaptation, but I did hope that the director would add some kind of change that made The Ring distinct from Ringu.Also, I felt that the presence of Samara was very toned down compared to Ringu. In Ringu, Sadako was an angry girl that I would wet my pants upon meeting, but in the Ring, Samara seemed almost like a sad girl with a sad past and no more. I'm sure other people would disagree, but at least the character of Samara did leave me with less fear for compared to Sadako (which was borderline traumatizing). But in either case, fans of American horror films would most likely feel a lack of impact that the main villain would leave, compared so lets say Freddy Krueger.Otherwise, its still a solid movie. I suggest anybody to watch it for a taste of so-called J-Horror adaptation.",7,0,0,23 May 2008
Iron Man," Best Marvel adaptation yet
","Wow, I loved this movie! I haven't read enough of the Iron Man original comics, but still this movie was amazing. I would have to say, Iron Man has been the best Marvel origin movie so far, followed by X-Men and Spiderman.EXCELLENT graphics, amazing acting performance, and awesome script. The dialogue especially impressed me, with its witty sense of humor that was not over done at any point. The movie is absolutely enjoyable. A MUST SEE in theaters. The one downside I have noticed is its 'rushed' end. I loved how the movie was developed, as I really got to know the character of Tony Stark and the development of Iron Man, but I have to say the final battle scene was very rushed compared to the rest of the movie. The final scene was great, but the movie did leave me hanging in an odd sort of way, thinking 'wait, that's it for the enemy???' The rest of the plot isn't too special either, but it's enjoyable. The character development of non-main characters was also left relatively low, compared to the main protagonist. In a sense, the movie was honest in that it was (almost strictly) about Iron Man (and Tony Stark), and I can see people wishing that the creators put a little bit more into other character development. Personally though, I liked it how it was.I've heard that there will be a sequel, and I am looking forward for it. I have a feeling that it would not meet up to the quality of this one, but if they continue the script quality of this one, I'm sure to enjoy it greatly.",8,1,2,22 May 2008
