The Avengers," Overrated and Generic
","No one will probably read this but...
The Avengers is pretty mediocre. I adore a lot of the other MCU films but for me, this one just feels empty. While watching this I literally felt no emotion at all, I don't know why. I feel like if you remove the hype, it's just a generic action movie. So sorry Marvel fans, but this gets a 5/10 from me.",5,1,2,3 July 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The worst movie I've ever seen
","I still can't get over how bad this was. The trailers looked great but in reality it has terrible writing, horrible CGI, bad acting (except for my boy Obi Wan). The list could go on and on. Why is everyone saying The Last Jedi sucks when we have this?!??",3,0,1,4 May 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Great Superhero Movie
","The people who are saying this is the best film of all time are wrong. This isn't Best Picture worthy, but it is a really fun film. It was epic seeing all these characters come together to fight Thanos. Speaking of Thanos, he was a great villain, definitely one of the best in the entire MCU (Loki is still better though). 
I recommend watching these movies first if you haven't seen any MCU movies yet:
The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, Avengers: Age of Ultron and Captain America: Civil War. 
Those movies will help you understand the story a bit better. 
So yeah, I loved this film.",7,2,3,23 June 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Decent
","This movie is entertaining. It has good acting, good action and a great ending. But it's not a masterpiece like everyone says. Its not the best superhero movie and its not even the best MCU movie in my opinion. It's just a fun movie. That's it. I would recommend this movie to Marvel fans or someone with some free time.",7,0,2,14 October 2018
Back to the Future Part III," A decent ending to an otherwise incredible trilogy.
","I absolutely love the other two BTTF films, but I've always been disappointed by this one. It's not exactly a bad movie, I quite enjoy it at parts. It's just so underwhelming compared to the first two movies. If you don't compare it to the other ones, it's just a dumb, fun time travel movie. 6/10.",6,1,2,3 July 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy," Hilarious
","This movie made me laugh so damn hard. It was hilarious, while at the same time having strong messages about friendship and love. It's just a fun film!",8,1,2,23 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Best Si Fi Movie of all time
","This is not only the best Star Wars movie, but the best Sci Fi movie. It's filled with great writing, action, acting and iconic moments. Your life is not complete without seeing this masterpiece. (Just make sure you watch A New Hope before you watch this!)",9,0,0,28 September 2018
