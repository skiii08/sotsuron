Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I'm getting sick and tired of the Prequel bashing.
","I'm getting sick and tired of the Prequel bashing, it is getting boring now, it has been Sixteen years since Phantom was released. Are the people here really disliking these Films with such hatred or is it peer pressure to not admit that they like them as well or to some extent as the Originals? I get it, I really do, people who remember the Original films as a child have fond memories as I do, I was Five in 1977. If these films were released in 1977, 1980 & 1983 instead of the Originals we would probably like them just as much? I regard all Six Films, soon to be Nine, as one big story, not as individual Films. I'm going to admit I like these Films, not as much as the Originals, they certainly are not as bad as people make out but many of you will obviously disagree with me?",7,3,5,19 July 2015
