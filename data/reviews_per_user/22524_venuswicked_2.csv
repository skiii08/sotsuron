Requiem for a Dream," do not see this movie...
","Do not see this movie if you thought Julia Roberts really deserved that Oscar.  Do not see this movie if you really dig romantic comedies.  Do not see this movie if you don't enjoy thinking....or being pushed to the edge and left for dead.  Do not see this movie if you don't want to be haunted, moved, sickened, and utterly amazed.This movie did for smack what even 'Trainspotting' failed to do.  Although 'Trainspotting' had a definite anti-smack message, and some people died, and it was pretty disturbing it pales in comparison to this movie. 'Trainspotting' had a few really disturbing scenes, but even they were 'prettier' than half of what goes on in 'Requiem For A Dream'.  Renton crawls down a toilet; Harry shoots up into a festering wound and has his arm amputated.  And while no one dies physically in 'Requiem' (at least no major characters), in the end everyone is left with a large part of their soul missing....not to mention their mind.  There are other comparisons and contrasts to be made, but the point is: if you can still think drugs are 'cool'  or anything other than 'mind bending-ly terrifying' after watching this movie you are scary.Don't get me wrong, I loved 'Trainspotting' and I know that it wasn't meant to be what 'Requiem' was.  But the similarities were too obvious for me to ignore.  'Requiem' isn't meant to tell a story as much as 'Trainspotting' was.  'Requiem' is meant to put the fear of God into you, and it succeeds. And Ellen Burstyn is INCREDIBLE!Yes, the movie has flaws.  But I still haven't seen the 'perfect' movie yet, so that can hardly be held against it's brilliance.  Darren Aronofvsky is going places.  'Pi' was really good, 'Requiem' is great, I can't wait to see what's coming next...
So don't watch this movie if it sounds too hard to watch (and it is very hard to watch) and don't watch it if you don't want to be depressed (in a beautiful way).  But if you do decide to watch it, don't do it alone.I don't usually give stars, but just to show how much this movie moved me: 9 out of 10.  And it only got 9 because I'm still sane.",Null,2,3,27 May 2001
Unbreakable," this *was not* The Sixth Sense
","The biggest obstacle this movie had to face was this it wasn't The Sixth Sense, yet it was written and directed by the same man.This means, if you liked The Sixth Sense, you will be expecting Unbreakable to be as good or better than Shaymalan's first film (or, if you hated the first one, you will expect this one to suck or *possibly* get better, but you might just not see it at all)...which is all fine and good, but this is a totally different movie and can't really fairly be compared to The Sixth Sense.I really wanted to hate this movie b/c it was slow, poorly acted (despite the presence of Bruce Willis and Sam Jackson), and depressingly predictable. Duh, we all knew there was a twist in the end (thanks to The Sixth Sense)....could it have been a bit edgier, please!?  The premise was good, though....and needed to be better developed.The major problem was that Shaymalan was riding the wave of success that The Sixth Sense created for him and he didn't try hard enough with this movie. I truly think he is capable of and will offer us better in the future. The question is: will anyone go to see it when he does?",Null,0,0,10 December 2000
