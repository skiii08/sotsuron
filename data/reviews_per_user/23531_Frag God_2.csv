The Blair Witch Project," Best way to prepare yourself to watch this movie
","I saw this movie at the midnight show of opening night. Unfortunately, everyone else in town had heard of it too, so the theater was sold out. Although it was not actually 'scary', I really enjoyed watching this movie. It was the most suspenseful film I have seen in a very long time... if not ever.So anyway, here are some tips I believe would make the viewing of this film as enjoyable as possible. 1. Go when there are the fewest other people around. This probably involves going during the day or afternoon.  The fewer people in the room with you to distract you by lauging/coughing/answering cell phones the better.  The crowded theater effect does not help in this case, it hurts it. The feeling of isolation and being lost are what you're going for.2. Try not to anticipate what is going to happen. Don't try to fit in the short clips from the previews and figure out where you think it's headed. Just let the movie lead you along.3. Sit near the front of the theater. The sound only came out of the front row of speakers in the room I was in, so it was often hard to hear what was being said from where I was in the back. The volume is not very loud to begin with, because it is realisticly recorded from the videocamera's microphone.4. Have an open mind. This is not a regular movie. There are absolutely no computer generated graphics to awe at. There are no giant explosions or shootouts. The greatness of this movie is in the realism of the scripting and the acting. Consider it a work of art, something that belongs in a film festival and somehow escaped.5. Make it real in your mind. There seems to be much controversy over how much of this movie is based on real events. Most of the information available on the web indicates that it contains real footage. The disclaimer at the end of the credits states that it is entirely fiction, although probably for legal purposes. The bottom line is, the more real you make it in your head, the more intense and thus more entertaining it will be.  Just get it in your head before the film starts that everything you see really happened/is happening as you watch it.  You will have as much of a look of agony and fear on your face as the characters on the screen!6. Go to the bathroom before you the movie starts.  I don't know how long this movie is, but it seemed to fly by. This movie builds its suspense slowly and just keeps growing the longer it goes on. You don't want to be interrupted for anything.",Null,1,1,4 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Could have been awesome, watered down by stupid lizard cartoon character
","I was pretty hyped about seeing the next great Star Wars movie, but I tried to calm myself and to have realistic expectations before seeing it.  I thought the movie was awesome from the beginning, but as it progressed my opinion of it slowly deteriorated.  The special effects were by far the best of any Star Wars movie so far, but the other elements seemed to cancel them out.  I understand that you can't expect great acting from a little kid, but little Anakin was a central part of the movie.  The annoying computer generated cartoon-like character that tagged along for the entire movie was not though.  His annoying speech and goofball antics were only mildly amusing, and became just plain stupid as time went on.  The pod racing scene and the Jedi fight scenes were very well done. The final outside battle between Federation droids and poorly armed natives had EWOK written all over it however.  That along with the final celebration/award ceremony scene showed a complete lack of creativity.  They were ripped almost straight out of the endings of A New Hope and ROTJ.I definitely think it was worth seeing, and I only hope that in the next movie they sacrifice the slapstick humor and mushy little boy scenes for some real story and awesome action that I love the other Star Wars movies for.",6,0,1,20 May 1999
