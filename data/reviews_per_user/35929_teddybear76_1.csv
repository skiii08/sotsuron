United 93," intense, powerful, heart wrenching-every American must see!
","United 93 is a movie everyone true American must see. Not only is it a honorary tribute to those True American Heroes who were on board Flight United 93 on that black day of September 11, 2001, it is an ultimate reminder of why we are at war and defending our nation and our people from terrorism. Freedom comes at a price and the crew and passengers of all of the hijacked flights courageously stood for freedom for all of us with their heroic and unselfish acts on that day. They truly deserve this tribute and the attention of every American out there to see this movie at least once. In recognition of the lives lost and the heroic acts performed by these American Heroes, don't miss this movie, lest we ever forget!!!",10,1,4,14 May 2006
