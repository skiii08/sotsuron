Ali," You need to see for yourself
","I rated this movie this wayActing 9/10 Excitement 6/10 Ability to follow what is happening 5/10 5.1 Dolby surround sound 9/10 Flow 5/10See for yourself, if you like Ali, know anything about the era and can enjoy fine acting for fine acting's sake then go for it.  If you are generation X then you may not like it as much.  It is worth a watch - my opinion overall 6/10G",6,0,0,4 May 2002
