Hereditary," Wait for Netflix
","Does A24 keep their employees on this site to make sure the negative reviews are hidden? Here the users have given it 8 out of ten stars and Rotten Tomatoes users are giving it 59 percent. They both seem way too high.This movie started very slow and relied more on a creepy uncomfortable atmosphere than an actual story. It also had a lot of clunky foreshadowing but by the time anything came out of any of it I had already stopped caring. Eventually something interesting happened and I thought it would finally start moving but then this movie pumped its brakes hard and went right back to creeping along at a painfully slow pace. Towards the end (like the last 10-15 minutes) it started to move and I realized that all of the threads planted throughout the movie ended in a giant tangled mess of horror movie endings that have been done before, that don't match and really just feel silly. Toni Collette is a great actress probably the closest thing to a saving grace of this film, but sadly it's not enough. Save your money. You won't regret skipping this film in a theater.",3,14,36,8 June 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Better than I thought...
","After 'Black Panther,' and 'A Quiet Place' (2 films which received very high critical praise even though I personally thought they were long, boring, predictible nonsense films pretending to be something more than what they were) I had exremely low expectations for this film. I thought about skipping it all together. Without spoilers here is what I thought of 'Infinity War.'Pros:Light hearted Marvel style comedy is back in full force.Getting a fix of my favorite Marvel Characters ( i.e. Thor, Dr. Strange, Star-Lord, Groot, Rocket, Spider Man, etc.).Several big budget action scenes.Not pretentious. It's a big buget superhero film and doesn't try to be anything else.The 3D was worth it.Cons:The Marvel film release schedule removes even the slightest doubt that certain characters were never in any real jeopardy (i.e. Black Panther). Thanos is more exposition than action. He's probably the weakest part of the story even though they try hard to flesh him out. I can't reconcile the man with the monster he has already been painted as in previous installments. It may have been better to leave him pure evil than to try and rationalize his actions. He feels kind of silly now.Wakanda... still fighting with spears and shielding themselves with those goofy blanket cape forcefield thingys (at least there were no rhinos this time).Most action scenes were so far removed from civilization, it felt like there was not much at stake.No mention of Valkyrie. I hope she gets her own movie, maybe an R rated one like a female Deadpool.",8,1,3,28 April 2018
