First Man," The Triumph of the Therapeutic
","OK, credit duly given to the technical accomplishments of 'First Man' are indeed something to behold-Chazelle shot it on 35MM with IMAX cameras-but sadly he never explored the inner universe of his subject. We are left with a relentless and mind-numbing shaky-cam torture chamber for the viewer that at the end of the day undermines even the greatest strength of the film, its cinematographic prowess.
The consequence of such technical one-dimensionality is we never feel the complexity of emotions and politics that created this uniquely American man and narrative. Chazelle frames Armstrong's journey by starting with the death of his daughter at a very young age. Already a quiet man, Armstrong became even more so after it, never even talking about it with his wife , and pouring himself into his work. Sadly, Chazelle's trajectory remains merely psychological. We are left with a reading of 'First Man' that it's about a man who had to go to the moon to get over a tragedy no one should ever have to face. Chazelle reduces the cultural, emotional, political and spiritual complexity that is and was Neil Armstrong into a one-dimensional psychological narrative: the grieving father. There is more to both the Apollo Generation and Neil Armstrong than that.
Chazelle mutes and ignores the interwoven cultural, social and political milieu that fueled the NASA projects . Technical virtuosity alone cannot tell that story.
Neil Armstrong and Apollo's triumph was about more than the merely therapeutic.",3,2,4,20 October 2018
Gran Torino," Redemptive Friendship
","A masterful unsentimental tale of an emotionally wounded, war-traumatized veterans quest for redemption. Eastwood's character is a richly complex and haunted man. Equal parts blue-collar working class bigot, defender of the weak and marginalized, and seeker of justice on his terms. Decidely pre- and anti- political correctness, the 
barbershop banter scene is hilariously reminiscent of days when humor was non-ideological. He is at one old school and yet ultimately and sacrificially protective of those whom he allows into his heart and soul. This is one of Eastwood's finest and most spiritually mature films.",10,1,1,9 September 2018
The Greatest Showman," FAKE & Sentimental Crap
","A triumph of feel-good ideology and sentimentality, an utterly dishonest film. HALF THE FILM WAS FAKE NEWS. NEVER HAPPENED. JUST TELL THE FAR MORE INTERESTING REAL STORY OF PT BBARNUM WITHOUT YOUR AGENDA. WHAT AN INSULT TO THE INTELLIGENCE OF VIEWERS.",1,39,82,26 August 2018
