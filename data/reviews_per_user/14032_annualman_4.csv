Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A difficult task handled well
","Star Wars episodes 4 through 6 had one major advantage over The Phantom Menace; no one knew what was going to happen, and all 3 films are full of surprises. Now with this 'new' trilogy of episodes 1 to 3, all Star Wars fans know already that Anakin Skywalker is going to turn to the Dark Side and become Darth Vader, that at some point he will have children with Padme his bride, and that these children will grow up to be Luke and Leia. The fun this time is in seeing how it happened, although of course many fans are not going to be pleased with the results. I remember the attacks on Empire Strikes Back, and more importantly Return of the Jedi, when they were first released. Yet now no Star Wars fan would deny that these are classics. Yoda, the Ewoks....these creations were scorned by just about everyone! So whilst Jar Jar Binks is an annoying creature, well he isn't that bad as everyone is suggesting.And neither is the film. It stands up to repeated viewings, is highly entertaining, and sets its stall out well for The Clone Wars of episodes 2 and 3. Personally I cannot wait to see what Lucas does in the next two films. The music in TPM deserves special mention, as do the performances of Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Jake Lloyd, and Liam Neesson. I was impressed with them all - oh and Chancellor Palpatine, what a malevolent character! Great stuff, and as I say, May 16th 2002 is a date firmly notched onto my calendar.My advice: don't always believe bad reviews, get this one and decide for yourself. I would rate it somewhere between an 8 and a 9 out of 10.",Null,1,2,5 December 2001
Minority Report," Best I've seen for ages
","Minority Report has one of the worst titles of any film ever made!I was put off from seeing the film for that reason alone, and I very nearly missed a technological masterpiece laced with exciting visuals, an absorbing and thoroughly involving storyline, and the most thought provoking rollercoaster ride in ages! In short, this film is brilliant!Tom Cruise is excellent in his role as the cop who's set up and has to go on the run to prove his innocence. Its great to see Max Von Sydow on the big screen again. Those of you who loved Blade Runner will enjoy this new work based on a short story by Philip K Dick. Not as stark as Scott's SF thriller, Minority Report moves like lightning right up until its suspenseful conclusion.
9 out of 10...but oh, that title...",Null,0,0,6 February 2003
Armageddon," I love this picture!
","I watch ARMAGEDDON about once every two years; every time it retains its emotional impact, its tense excitement and its awesome spectacle. The pacing is typical of late 90s action buddy flicks, but this film has the twist that the whole world is potentially in danger from a global killer threat. Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Billy Bob Thornton, and in particular Will Patton, make this film wonderfully entertaining and wholly involving. A more entertaining way to pass 2 and a half hours has yet to be found! 9 out of 10",Null,2,4,17 February 2003
Signs," There's a great story in here, its just not told very well
","I really wanted to enjoy Signs. The trailer was captivating, the plot sounded full of possibilities. Mel Gibson is a tremendous actor and Shymalian had shown great promise as a director with the enjoyable albeit totally predictable Sixth Sense. But, just over 100 minutes after the film started, as the end credits were running, I asked myself what went wrong. I was soooo disappointed....The opening and end credits were abysmal; dreadful use of fonts, awful layout, and no audience involvement whatsoever. Some of the first half hour was excellent, but I'd seen most of it in the trailer for the film. But then it started going downhill when (SPOILER ALERT!!!) the alien invasion storyline came into play. We've seen it all before, and in much better and more engaging circumstances.Okay, Signs is not about aliens and invasions etc, its the story of one man's restoration of faith in a God who he felt had betrayed him. But its completely the wrong canvas on which to paint this picture.Mel Gibson acts like a tree in Signs - more wooden than those Russian dolls you can pick up down your local gift boutique. Rory Culkin is okay, the actress playing his sister (sorry, forgotten her name) is the best thing about Signs, and Joaquin Phoenix could have been just about anybody. The alien creature is total crapola, and not worth the 90 minute wait to see.
There could have been a great film in Signs, it has all the pieces to construct an exciting jigsaw, but Shymalian doesn't know how to put those pieces together. A shame, and a wasted opportunity.2 out of 10",Null,1,1,4 February 2003
