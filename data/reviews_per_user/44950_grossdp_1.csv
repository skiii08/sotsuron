","I don't know why I expected a roller derby movie directed by, of all people, Drew Barrymore, to be any good. Perhaps I thought an IMDb rating meant something. In this case, it didn't.I suffered through more than one hour of this sloppily directed, poorly written trash before deciding not to waste another 45 or so minutes of my life I would never get back. The only redeeming element of this trash can chick flick was the acting. Ellen Page and Alia Shawkat are both fine actresses, and Marcia Gay Harden was good even in her boring, clich√© conservative mother role.Aside from that, there was nothing. Nothing aside from Drew Barrymore trying her hand at being a good indie director... and failing miserably. For chrissake, there's an underwater kissing scene that lasts about 15 minutes set to pretentious indie pop music.I thought the move was almost over after 2 hours and saw I had only been watching for 1 hour. That was my cue. I hope this can be yours. Don't waste your time!!!",2,17,36,4 January 2010
