Mission: Impossible III," awesome
","This movie is easily the best of the 3 so far..Not only is their non-stop, fluid action throughout the movie, but the story line and the way the film is made is much better due to the directing of J.J. Abrams.We get to see how a top secret agent like Ethan Hunt attempts to stop the villains while protecting the ones he loves. There are some interesting new characters(Zhen, Declan, Brassel and Musgrave) as well as on old favourite in Luther (Ving Rhames). Also a MacGuffin is used to keep the audience guessing after the movie to what the function of the 'Rabbit's Foot' really is.To sum up, a great action movie with a interesting storyline.",10,1,2,17 February 2007
