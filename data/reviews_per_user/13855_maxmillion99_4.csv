Deja Vu," Deja Vu is a great ride!
","I was also at that Century City screening last night, and I was probably one of the people who were saying they thought this movie was awesome. I enjoyed it immensely. It has been described as an action-adventure-romance-sci-fi pic and it truly is all of that.First of all, the cinematography was stunning. Tony Scott and his DOP, Paul Cameron, do fantastic work -- every shot is beautifully composed. And all the footage that involves a cast of thousands (meaning the crowd scenes) is masterful work.I don't know why I started with commenting on the photography (also the editing) of this movie. It's probably because that is what struck me from the very beginning, particularly when there is so much going on in the opening sequence. Yet you never get lost. Above all, the performances and story are great and really suck you in. Yes, this movie requires a fair bit of suspension of disbelief. I would go so far as to say the plot was far-fetched, but the heart of the story just takes you along for the ride.For the record, I felt Scott's most recent teaming with Denzel, Man on Fire, was one of the best movies of 2004. I don't think Deja Vu is as good as Man on Fire, but it's right up there as one of the most entertaining and thrilling movies I've seen this year.For sheer entertainment and an intriguing (though not flawless) plot, Bruckheimer, Scott and Co. sure have DELIVERED the goods.I recommend you see Deja Vu on the big screen with a big, loud audience for maximum enjoyment. Part of the appeal last night was exactly that; hearing the audience -- as one -- laugh, applaud and sigh along with this movie and getting swept up in that communal experience.post scriptum -- Any fans of Otto Preminger's wonderful 1994 classic Laura may be delighted by the echoes of that storyline in Deja Vu.",9,228,341,9 November 2006
Ghost Rider," I don't fully understand all the negative reviews...
","We rented Ghost Rider last night (July 4th - fireworks - yay!) and we really enjoyed it immensely! I had wanted to see it on the big screen, in spite of all the negative reviews, and now I wish I had because we don't own a monster TV and I had to wear my driving glasses to watch it (which I never generally have to do when watching TV at home...) I completely loved the basic premise of this story when I first heard it.I thought the tone of the whole movie was pitch-perfect. Everyone's movements were so precise. Sometimes they were just acting with their eyes. I dug all the camera movements -- this movie had momentum, which was appropriate to the subject matter. Nic Cage is a fantastic (if limited in range) actor and well suited to this kind of comic book *extreme* role. Wes Bentley was great. I really liked the Police Captain and his dark-haired side-kick. (Lots of Aussie actors in this movie as it was shot there.) Eva Mendes was a little disappointing -- I like her a lot but her acting wasn't great (I blame neglectful direction) and she wasn't given enough to do. Plus, her costuming was appallingly poor. There's one time when she's getting back into the car and we see her from behind and her dress is so ill-fitting and wrinkly. Sure, we got to see lots of cleavage (not too much) but dressing a sexy Latina with olive skin in a brown dress that's almost the same colour as her brown hair AND then putting a brown leather jacket on top of that? UGH! Did they WANT her to disappear?! Yeah, I've never read the comics, but I will now.",7,2,4,5 July 2007
Transformers," Slick, pro-military propaganda and simple storyline
","Transformers was fine entertainment. Definitely skewed towards a young audience (tweens) thanks to its simplicity.Big 'wow' factor, especially with the speccy spfx. One jaw-dropping moment, in particular, was a scene late into the movie when a gold-coloured Decepticon (the evil robots) appeared to be roller-blading down the freeway in pursuit of the good guys.Really impressive how seamlessly the animation blended with the live action.The part that left a really nasty taste in my mouth was how blatantly pro-war it all was. Military might and efficiency plus zero body count (wait, did someone die in this movie?) as opposed to the grim and harsh reality of countless deaths daily in this current war and pretty well every other war that's ever happened. I even turned to my guy at one stage and said (obviously ironically) 'I wanna enlist!' That definitely seemed to be what Bay was going for above all else.Ugh!",5,9,19,10 July 2007
There Will Be Blood," Good, in spite of weak direction ...
","PTA really needs to get over himself. He is far from a great filmmaker. Although I quite enjoyed the movie and am glad I saw it, I think there are many flaws in the sketchy (as in lightly sketched vs deep) storytelling of There Will Be Blood. Where is the character depth, the motivations, the background and the context to these events and this man's tale? I did enjoy the tipping see-saw balance of power between Plainview and the Preacher. I do not, however, share everyone's accolades for Paul Dano. He did his best, but he was ill-suited for this role as a morally ambiguous preacher.Also -- SPOILER -- the part when Plainview rubs mud in the preacher's mouth came out of nowhere! Huh?-- end spoiler-- The only thing that maintained my interest in this movie was the intensity and ferocity of the magnificent performance by Daniel Day Lewis.Although I have to begrudgingly admit that the director was, in part, responsible for eliciting such a stunningly fierce and chilling performance, I doubt very much that even a crappy director would be left with a crappy performance from Day Lewis. I just don't think he's capable of giving less than his all. He is truly one of the greatest actors of our generation. Also the film's score is a complete joke and the fault largely resides with the choices of this oftentimes pretentious and perverse director. The score is far too attention seeking and emotionally inconsistent. Although I applaud a director that takes a risk with an atypical score for a Hollywood movie, this one misfires too often to be considered successful.Still, There Will Be Blood is definitely worth seeing, for Daniel Day Lewis, for a decent yet bare-bones story and for seeing what not to do when you are at the helm of a big Hollywood movie with a large budget.",8,5,12,7 January 2008
