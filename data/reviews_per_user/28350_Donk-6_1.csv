The Blair Witch Project," Scary Ha
",I cant believe what a load of rubbish the film was it was so irritating and unreal. You could not believe that uni students would go into the woods so unprepared looking for something that is so far fetched as a witch.I get more scared watching buffy than watching the blair witch project.If anyone hasnt seen the movie believe me forget it and save your money.,Null,2,4,25 April 2000
