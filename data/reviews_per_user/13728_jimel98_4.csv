The Finest Hours," Amazing True Story
","Yup, Amazing, but I gave it an 8. I ONLY gave it an 8 because so much of it seemed a bit too Hollywood-ish. But hey, I'm not a film maker and a history buff, not a historian. But as I watched and thought now and then, 'Oh, REALLY?' I still enjoyed the intensity. The slow start was a nice way to introduce a couple of the main characters, just a couple and funny enough they ARE a couple. Bernie and Miriam. But even they don't get too much in-depth coverage. But that's OK, it's not really about them, but it's enough to give you a bit of a reason to feel for someone besides everyone who risks their lives in this scenario.If you're reading this (and few will, I know) you already know the story, so we'll skip that. This is kind of an opinion forum/review. Here's mine.GOOD MOVIE. Like I mentioned, I saw some clich√©s, some 'Hollywood' moments that don't happen in real life and some silliness. I also saw a true story and as often happens with me, the full impact truly hits when photos of the actual folks are shown at the end. Holy Moly, that's the way to make a jaw drop. Then, I looked up the whole story and even by way of the United States Coast Guard's own website, the movie is far more accurate than I imagined. Little exaggeration here. We're talking life threatening, edge of your seat, nails chewed to the knuckle stuff and portrayed far better than I believed. OK, so Bernie and Miriam were actually married already, not engaged like in the movie, big deal. I'll cope.Chris Pine has truly impressed me. I liked him as Capt. Kirk more (smarmy, snarky and lovable) but here he takes on a real life person and does him justice. Miriam, played by Holliday (add an 'l' and it's now a name! Hippies. Sheesh) Grainger was sympathetic and believable, not fake. Casey Affleck gave a voice to a character that in real life seems to have been forgotten; a man who did as much to save the remaining crew of the Pendleton as anyone and did it wonderfully.The supporting cast, most especially Ben Foster and Kyle Gallner came through like champs. Everyone always remembers the MAIN guy, but hey, if the other guys weren't there, the main guy could NEVER accomplish what was done and these guys throw that in your face, but respectfully.I have always had enormous respect for the USCG and feel they are truly the overlooked heroes of our armed forces, especially in peacetime. This movie (as well as 'The Guardian') is finally shining a much deserved spot light on them and in a respectful, professional and entertaining way.",8,1,1,18 September 2016
John Wick," This will be brief.
","One never tends to expect much from a movie staring Keanu Reeves. Why? I'm not sure, I think he does just fine and I'm usually entertained, but that's just me. This movie is, well, if you abhor violence, this movie is NOT for you. I don't like violence for no reason, but the violence in this movie IS the reason for the movie. It's fast, it's justified (bear with me) and it's amazing.Others have given plot summaries but it seems almost required so; Former Hit man goes for revenge on the scumbag gangsters who wronged him and as it happens, he has a connection with them. OK. That's over with.Not since 'Shoot 'Em Up' has a movie been solely about the violence and not since 'Shoot 'Em Up' has it been done so well. Even the faint of heart could enjoy this movie and trust me, I know people who cringe at violence in movies, my wife is THE prime example, and yet, you get lost in the action. It's non-stop. The few breaks between fights and shootings are seemingly filler, but necessary filler.I had heard great things, but once I watched it today, I was VERY impressed. How do you root for a bad guy? Well, when he's killing WORSE guys, how can you not root for him? And yeah, he kills a LOT of them.John Wick also displays a certain charm, not a 007 type of charm, but an all business charm. He will never mess with you if you're not a part of his business. Is that ETHICS? Sure, why not. He's not flamboyant, he's not over the top, he's all business, yet very civil, very refined and decent...unless you ARE his business.I was far more impressed than I expected and I DID expect to be impressed. If you don't like violence, don't see this. If you don't mind violence so long as it has a purpose and moves the story, you'll LOVE this. If you LOVE violence, seek help and soon. You're potentially dangerous.",10,3,8,4 August 2015
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," if you don't like this movie....
","'Shut your #@*&ing face, Uncle #@*&er!' This movie is one of the crudest, cruelest, sickest, most hilarious movies ever made. Sure, you can't get much lower with the humor, though those geniuses the Ferrelly Brothers have tried. Where the Ferrelly's go, Matt Stone and Trey Parker go farther and it works.This movie is NOT for the easily, or even not so easily offended, but, screw them! They should know better than to go see it. I've seen it several times and laugh right up through the end title song by Michael MacDonald. I'm still outraged that 'Blame Canada' didn't win the Oscar for Best Original Song! I've seen and enjoyed plenty of good musicals. Oh, and I've hated plenty, too, but that's not important. This is a GOOD musical and even those for whom this movie is tasteless and offensive would have to admit that. The music is good, very good and blends well with the story, which is pretty basic. Terrence and Phillip, Canada's greatest comedy duo make an R rated musical that the boys see. I won't go into who the boys are or explain any characters. Sorry, no time or desire to get into it. Anyway, they come out spouting the dialogue, much of which is pretty filthy. Well, Canada gets the blame and one thing leads to another, and war is declared. Some celebrity's die in the process, but that's life, eh? There's a fair amount of social commentary in this film, as is the norm for Matt and Trey and of course, nothing is spared. I won't spoil the ending, but everybody wins!",10,0,0,1 October 2006
Inside Out," What a marvelous Gem
","I took my granddaughter to see this and dammnit, I want to see it again. It's funny, simply FUNNY. I won't bore you with a recap of the plot as you can see that about a dozen different places on this site. I'll just give you my take, the opinion of a 55 year old guy. I laughed my butt off quite a few times, and when I wasn't laughing, I was a bit misty eyed.It's brilliantly written for every age group and anyone who doesn't appreciate the cleverness that transcends age, gender and species (trust me...)you must be one very dull person. Sorry, but that's how I see it.It shows a situation many have dealt with (moving to a new place and trying to adjust) and even though I've never had to experience that, I've known folks who've had to and this hits the mark. It also hits the mark on the though processes we all face in every day life in a very humorous way and by a wonderful cast.If you're human (or a dog or a cat...wait 'til the end!) you can identify with this and might find yourself saying....I wonder just how much of this might be kind of true.And yeah, as I watched it, I hearkened back to 'Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid To Ask' and numerous similar 'inside the body' movies. Each has had it's strengths, THIS ONE is strong start to finish.",10,16,49,7 July 2015
