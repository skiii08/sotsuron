Requiem for a Dream," Shatteringly Beautiful.
","This is not a nice film. It doesn't pretend to be. But it is one of the finest films I've seen for a long, long time. I bought the DVD some months ago but I never got round to watching until last night. By the end off it I was emotionally drained. Ellen Burstyn should have won the Oscar for this film without a shadow of a doubt. Her acting in this film is one of the top five female performances ever. Julia Roberts could never, ever produce a performance as excoriatingly painful as this. I was totally and utterly blown away by Ellen Burstyn. The rest of the cast are just as good, with particular praise for Jennifer Connelly. She is a beautiful girl who goes to hell, a tragic waste so common in real life. And that's the point of this film. It's all too real for comfort. I don't know when I'll be able to watch this magnificent film again, but I know I will have to. This is not entertainment, it's a horribly beautiful nightmare. Watch it and feel the pain.",10,1,2,25 May 2004
Citizen Kane," A vastly overrated ego-trip for Orson Welles and movie critics alike.
","This could have been the greatest movie ever made except for one problem, it has no heart or soul. Like Charles Foster Kane himself, it is a magnificently empty gesture. Yes, Welles acts and directs superbly, yes the lighting and photography are beautiful, yes the story is wonderfully told; and yet...and yet... So what do we get? well, we get a collection of moments that never really make a whole. We get the ' Rosebud ' bit, we get Greg Toland's camerawork,we get Welles showboating performance as Kane and so on.But. I have watched this film many times and each time I feel cheated because it all comes to nothing.It is a city built on sand. It's not that I don't like the film, but like a child that doesn't fulfil it's potential, it makes me a little sad and a little mad. I suppose that I'll get hate mail from every film student and critic in the world but I stand by my opinion. It's easy to see why this film is so feted, but in my opinion it is an illusion, a three card trick. After all, Orson Welles loved illusions and tricks. Maybe you CAN fool some of the people all of the time.",9,2,5,17 March 2000
Notting Hill," Ah, the romance of it all...
","Do you like a bit of romance? A bit of comedy? A bit of simple feel-good entertainment? Then look no further than Notting Hill. Here's Hugh Grant in the movie that is the perfect vehicle for his awfully-nice-but-a-bit-dim Englishman. And it works beautifully. His character lives in a little world of awfully nice people that never quite make a success of anything but they don't really care much. It's a small world of good friends, enjoying their lives, smiling at misfortune...very British. In fact, it's really quite a small movie, an ensemble piece that Hugh Grant uses to demonstrate his great talent for comedy acting. His characterisation of William is perfectly presented thanks to his natural talent for this kind of role. Of course he has played the same role many times but if that's what the director wants, then Hugh is your man. The supporting cast play their roles to perfection, some of the little cameo parts are as good as you will see anywhere. James Dreyfuss as the effete and just-a-little-bit-dim Martin is hilarious but tinged with the same resignation of failure as all the rest. Rhys Ifans plays the slightly unhinged Welshman perfectly, an extension of the part he played as one of the psychotic, drug fuelled Lewis brothers, bent on revenge in 'Twin Town' And what of Julia Roberts? Well, she plays along with all these warm hearted British types, looking a little bit bemused but all she has to do is play herself, a Hollywood star who falls for an ordinary mortal. Which is what she did when she married Danny Moder in real life. Notting Hill is a perfect piece of romantic escapism, watch it with your loved one and enjoy the romance of it all. And when Elvis Costello sings 'She' at the end of the film, well, it brings a tear of happiness to even the most cynical of eyes. Ah, isn't it lovely!One day I'll watch it with Annushka, but I hope she doesn't fall asleep half way through it :)Ya tebya lyublu.",9,5,6,29 September 2006
Salt," There are no words to describe this abomination
","For the record, this abomination should have a zero mark. Even one star is too many. This excrescence is an insult to humanity. Angelina Jolie should hang her hypocritical head in shame for taking part in this stinking pile of ordure and then berating the rest of the world for the plight of starving children, or whatever her pet project is this month. Just think about it Angie dear: this malodorous movie cost in excess of $100 million to make - including, no doubt, many millions for your pathetic 'acting talents'. Would it not have been so much better to spend even half of this eye-watering sum of moolah on getting clean water and sanitation to some of the world's less fortunate children. Or do you think that adopting a few of them salves your conscience enough for you to continually make enormous sums of money from your somewhat less enormous 'acting talent'? Anyway, enough of the Angelina berating (for now). What about the movie? I hear you ask. Well, what about it? It is a waste of time, unless you're a brain-dead nit-wit. That's all I can say about it. There is nothing worth writing about. But Angelina...oh dear Angelina... I suggest you donate every penny of your unwarranted fee to one of your favourite causes and take up a career as a real charity worker, as opposed to a part-time celebrity UN ambassador, or whatever it is you're supposed to be, instead of asking the poor of the world, i.e. Me, to contribute a brass razoo to your bank balance. Be ashamed, be very ashamed.",1,4,9,30 July 2013
To Rome With Love," Cab for Mr. Allen!
","The scene opens with a small red haired guy sitting in a movie theatre staring at the flickering images on the screen. The black and white images are reflected in his black framed glasses. His eyes are wide in wonder and awe, he holds a bag of popcorn in his hands but he never eats any. The movie finishes and he remains transfixed as the sparse audience leaves the darkness of the cinema.'I gotta make this movie in Rome, Fellini made his movies in Rome'The red haired guy is now a grey haired old guy and he's talking to someone in staccato, stuttering phrases.'Whaddya mean, I'm no Fellini? Did Fellini ever win an Oscar?'A woman's voice replies like a patient parent trying to explain to a five year old he has to go to bed.'And Bergman made his movies in Sweden but you never went there did you?''Yeah, I know but Sweden is cold and gloomy''So were all your Bergman homage movies''Whaddya mean? hey I gotta tell ya, I got great reviews for those movies and..''...very few paying customers''It's not all about money, Fellini never made any money either''That's the only thing you have in common with Fellini''Oh, funny! who writes your screenplays?''Not you, obviously''Listen, I'm going to make this movie in Rome and that's that''Enjoy your holiday''It's not a holiday, I'll be making a movie''With you it's the same thing''Listen honey, people will love it, I guarantee it''Sure they will, everyone loves to look at holiday snaps''Oh! you really gotta start putting this stuff down on paper''And you should stop making holiday movies''Fellini never had to put up with kind of stuff''He didn't think he was Woody Allen'This is a terrible movie. Don't waste your time. Woody Allen has lost any plot he may have had, as has this movie. It is a hopeless attempt by the once great director to be Fellini and it fails on every level. Apart from the nice photography it is rubbish. It is with a heavy heart that I must write these words about a man that has produced a few of the truly great movies, but I'm afraid I must. Midnight in Paris was bad but this is even worse. Except this doesn't have Owen Wilson, which is the only saving grace I can think of.",1,4,9,5 July 2013
Event Horizon," Total rubbish
","I watched this last night on tv. I can't recall ever subjecting myself to such a painful cinematic experience before.This celluloid monstrosity should be given a health warning as it could quite easily induce murderous intentions or even suicidal tendencies into the unsuspecting viewer.There is no rating low enough for this pile of excrement,but just for the record,0/10.",1,8,17,13 June 2000
2001: A Space Odyssey," A thing of beauty and a joy forever.
","I have just watched this on tv for about the hundreth time and still it weaves a rare spell of visionary magic.There is no point in trying to convince those who believe this to be the most boring film ever made, just as there is no need to preach to the converted who love this as a work of genius.Just remember that without the technology that exists today, Stanley Kubrick made what is still the benchmark film of the genre.This is a magnificent movie that paved the way for so many space films,none of which can hold a candle to 2001.But it is more than just a sci-fi drama. It is a mesmerising symphony of vision and sound that is unlikely to be equalled because, unlike most directors today, Kubrick wasn't a slave to SFX. And studios today would baulk at the time this movie took to make.Stanley Kubrick was a true pioneer, let's be thankful that he gave us so many great movies.10/10 and a big thank you.",10,0,2,2 January 2004
A Clockwork Orange," A Tour de Force of cinema, a powerful prediction which came true.
","So much has been written about this film, not least on the IMDb, however,a few facts need to be established for the benefit of those who were not around at the time of the original release in 1971. At that time the British newspapers were full of articles condemning the film as a disgusting,depraved,celebration of violence and pornography.The government of the day were being urged to ban the film before civilization as we know it was destroyed.This is not an exaggeration.Much the same thing happened a couple of years later when The Exorcist was released.Of course, none of the so-called guardians of the nations morals had actually seen the film, but they knew enough about it to try to stop the rest of the country having the opportunity to make their own minds up.Which of course is one of the themes of the story.So all this tied in quite well with Kubrick's intentions.He was never in the business of offering answers in any of his works and this is no different.You make your own mind up.The world was a very different place in 1971 and cinema audiences,on the whole, were not so sophisticated as they are now.Or maybe not so blase about sex and violence not having been fed the constant torrent of such material that the modern world takes for granted.But without A Clockwork Orange its very probable that the trail may not have been blazed quite so soon.Whether you think that's a good thing or not is up to you.But at least you have the choice.To correct another common misunderstanding,the movie was never banned anywhere (in the civilised world that is).Kubrick withdrew it from British cinemas within a year because of the way it was misunderstood and misrepresented by the British press.You could, however take a short trip to Paris where it was shown almost constantly.It was only when Kubrick died that his wife decided to allow the film to be re-released in Britain in cinemas and on video that modern audiences got the chance to see for themselves what all the fuss was about.And the general concensus of opinion seemed to be that in comparison to films such as Goodfellas,Taxi Driver,etc, A Clockwork Orange wasn't much to get upset about.The passage of time had dulled peoples senses. But,a lot of what is depicted in the film has since become commonplace.The acceptance of violence,the casual attitude to to casual sex,the alienation and fear of people living in so-called modern housing developments(some of the film was shot in the Thamesmead housing estate in south London which has since become a run down no go area populated by gangs of violent thugs).As to the main thrust of the piece,whether it is right to take away someone's freedom to choose,the jury is still out.You make your decision. This is a great work of cinematic genius.It is unrivalled by any other film, it is unique.If you come to watch it with preconceived ideas you may be disappointed so keep an open mind.When Kubrick was looking for an actor to play Alex he only had one man in mind,Malcolm McDowell.He had seen him in a movie called If...in which he played a rebellious public schoolboy.To this day McDowell has never come close playing another part like Alex,not because he isn't a good actor,but because,quite simply there is not another part like Alexander De Large.This is a 10/10 movie.See it and watch a masterpiece.",10,0,0,21 November 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Absolute Drivel
","I was going to write a whole essay about why I dislike this film but as I've already wasted two hours of my life watching it, I won't. Suffice to say that Keanu Reeves is the worst actor in the worst film I've had the misfortune to suffer. A pretentious pile of steaming s**t.",1,2,4,22 February 2004
The Truman Show," freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
","I have just watched this fabulous film on video for about the twentieth time and I am smiling.Why? because this is a film that says wherever there is an individual there is hope.Jim Carrey should have won something for this film because he is outstanding as Truman.It does not surprise me at all that this film was completely ignored by the motion picture academy awards, after all, there is an intelligence at work here that the movers and shakers of Hollywood just would not understand.In 1967 in the UK we had a TV series called 'The Prisoner'that was the forerunner of The Truman Show.In it's time it was villified and sanctified in equal measure.Because public opinion forced the TV networks to broadcast this series without explanation or apology, for nearly forty years the argument has raged as to what the hell this programme was all about.Now, if The Truman Show can do have the same effect,then it has done it's job.See this movie at all costs and think about it.This is NOT a Jim Carrey comedy,but it might save you from drowning in a sea of apathy.",9,0,1,3 December 2002
Casino," A detached view of the American psyche
","Perhaps its an American thing to glorify the violence of Scorsese's gangster films and to see totally inhuman creatures of no worth as heroes.Regardless of the actual cinematic merits of this film,no reasonable person could justify the portrayal of violence and murder displayed for our edification.The characters are tired stereotypes rehashed from the equally pointless 'Goodfellas'.DeNiro turns on the acting autopilot and is not worth his money.Joe Pesci is a one trick pony and really should try to broaden his portfolio a little.The rest of the cast appear to be from the rent-a-bad Italian agency.So we watch a story of a bunch of Italian American Mafia/Mob wannabes beating each other up and swearing at every opportunity due to a rubbish scriptwriter.So what? This film has nothing to say,nothing to show and nothing to exist for,except perhaps for those whose sad lives lead them into believing that bad is good and violence is the new religion. This is a disgusting film,worthy of nothing but scorn.",Null,2,6,28 November 2001
