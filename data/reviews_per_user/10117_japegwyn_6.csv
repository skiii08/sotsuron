Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Remake the Original and Prequel Trilogies
","What is this Trade Federation, why does it have it in for Naboo, and why are Jedi intervening? From the opening crawl, little makes sense.The Battle Droids are (like all other mechas) pseudo sentient... but why? Really annoying.R2D2 and C3PO turn up: super annoying and totally baffling.Sure, it looks terrific, yes the actual set pieces are spectacular with the proper sound palette, but...Lucas, bless him: dialogue and directing not his strongest points. Dry, clunky dialogue which is impossible to perform with any conviction, and little Jake Lloyd just couldn't act. AT ALL. What were they thinking?Just take the original 6 films and remake the lot so they make sense and have less nonsense, and better dialogue/acting.",2,0,2,6 January 2019
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Marquand Gone Too Soon
","Richard Marquand and ILM deliver a terrific film except for the BLOODY EWOKS! Hateful things.So, yes... In line with the other 5 in the original half dozen, remake it and give us decent aliens to align with for the final battle.Interesting Star Wars films CAN be made: Solo's more fun than you think, Howard managed to cobble a half-decent flick together; Rogue One was terrific; with episodes 7 and 8 I personally had the sort of Star Wars I've been yearning for.",4,0,2,6 January 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Remake the original and Prequel Trilogies
","Way too long, with dialogue even clunkier than Episode 1, this tried to go where Avatar would eventually tread (so a certain kudos for that, but...).Again, her from Naboo is the object of some badguys for some reason... Why? At about the time that Episode 1 happened some unknown Jedi Master ordered a clone army... Again, why? Why was this not even teased in Episode 1, especially when a third of this tedious trollop teases the birth of the Skywalker Twins and coming of Darth Vader.Stunning set pieces, many of which are too long for no reason. It seems Hayden can't act... Like little Jake: so maybe it's just the character? No. It's just bad. Amidala has no business being attracted to such a badly acted person.Again, Lucas's dry and dismal dialogue leaves little to engage with and moments which should be of great import are a mild, 'meh.'Christopher Lee shows how it should be done though.Remake this trilogy, and the originals: comb through to give consistency: and make the buggers back to back. Hellfire, most of the vis fx could simply be reused...",2,0,1,6 January 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," George Does It Again!
","With exponentially clunkier dialogue and run time which gives a greater impression of eternity than eternity itself, this has so little jeapardy it's hard to care.We all know where it has to get to, and it just outstays its welcome. On home viewing format, at least one can break it into manageable 'chapters' at about 40 mins per session.Yet again, the emotion crux of the entire prequel trilogy should be a heartrending climax... But it just isn't, and that is down to incompetence, pure and simple: I mean, we've ALL shed a tear at a John Williams score now and again, haven't we.Remake this, with heart and passion, and put in the epic good/evil internal struggle. I WANT to love and to feel this series, but it's so sterile..!Amazing visuals, but because the whole thing is so badly handled, it's remarkable in its ordinariness.",2,1,5,6 January 2019
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Trend Setter
","Sure, it gave the ILM, and it has a certain charm, but... Watch this after seeing the later The Last Starfighter.Sure, similarities they tried to avoid, but George Lucas showed the world that he shouldn't be let anywhere near a script or a studio in the capacities here... He's a fantastic producer, a brilliant 'creator' who could.plot the thing, but dialogue with heart? Beats you could care about?George doesn't do that.R2D2 and C3PO were fresh at the time, but always were annoying.Remake this, dial back the bloody robots and let's get some consistency",3,0,2,6 January 2019
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The least imperfect
","Quite like this one. Good director, even better script doctors. Annoying robots have their uses as comic beats, kept mercifully to a minimum.Still: remake it in line with the others.",4,1,5,6 January 2019
