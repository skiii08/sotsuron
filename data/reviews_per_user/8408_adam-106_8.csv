The Blair Witch Project," BRILLANT
","A landmark American film that challenges it's audience to let there imagination provide the real horror. We are watching the supposed footage of three film students who disappeared in 1994 while making a Documentary on a local legend called the Blairwitch. A local myth about a witch who was cast out by the town 200 years before. The students are led by a determined young woman who wants to make her film at all cost. The trio starts out well enough but are soon reduced to three frightened and lost people who are faced with trying to maintain their sanity. They become aware that something or someone seems to be tracking there every move. The nights are filled with voices around their tent and strange artifacts left in their paths.The finale is a scene of such terror that I won't soon forget it. In an interview several years ago Francis Coppola said that one day someone's going to take a video camera and make a great film, it's happened, Blair witch project shows what film can be, a highly original totally collaborative effort by all involved. Not since Orson wells directed Citizen kane over 50 years ago has their been a more interesting exercise in the art of filmmaking",Null,1,1,1 August 1999

Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Good Beginning!!
","I thoroughly enjoyed the film. I'll admit it took a little while to get use to the fact that you won't be seeing the familiar characters, but Lucas has laid a good foundation for his story. The most challenging story to tell is the one of Anakin Skywalker. He's cast a very good young actor named Jake Lloyd ,who for some reason has been getting some pretty bad press about his acting. This central person so important to the Starwars legend  is wonderfully told. Jedi knight Qui-Gon Jinn played by Liam Neesen  sees the  force in the child and takes him under his wing. The much talked about villian Darth Maul, while not seen much is used effectively. Basically a Hitman he's a person of few words but totally  impressive. The light saber battle is spectacular.As for the technical aspects of the film,  it's loaded with state of the art digital effects that are a wonder to see.  All in all the StarWars films will in years to come be a gauge by which to view the advancement of film technology.  Lucas at the forefront in this field will undoubtedly use the future episodes to introduce the world to these advancements. Lastly I couldn't help thinking that while movies have certainly improved in terms of effects and sound,  the actual film itself hasn't.",Null,0,0,22 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Good Beginning
","One Thing is certain... The debate over Episode One 'The Phantom Menace' will go on for some time. The obvious question... Has Lucas made a good film that can live up to it's predecessor's. In my opinion he has. Having just returned from the Zeigfield Theater in New York City, which is the only place to see it.  I thoroughly enjoyed the film. I'll admit it took a little while to get use to the fact that you won't be seeing the familiar characters, but Lucas has laid a good foundation for his story. The most challenging story to tell is the one of Anakin Skywalker, who in future films will be transformed from  Jedi knight to the Evil Lord Darth Vadar. He's cast a very good young actor named Jake Lloyd ,who for some reason has been getting some pretty bad press about his acting , I for one thought he was excellent and found my self trying to picture this sweet little boy turning into such a evil character. This central person so important to the Starwars legend  is wonderfully told. Jedi knight Qui-Gon Jinn played by Liam Neesen  sees the  force in the child and takes him under his wing. The much talked about villian Darth Maul, while not seen much is used effectively. Basically a Hitman he's a person of few words but totally  impressive. The light saber battle between him, Obi-Wan Kenobi  and Qui-Gon Jinn is spectacular.As for the technical aspect's of the film,  It's loaded with state of the art digital effects that are a wonder to see.  All in all the StarWars films will in years to come be a gauge by which to view the advancement of film technology.  Lucas at the forefront in this field will undoubtedly use the future episodes to introduce the world to these advancements. lastly I couldn't help thinking that while movies has certainly improved in terms of effects and sound,  the actual film itself hasn't, The print I saw had some specks and tears and at times didn't look all that good. I read several years ago that Lucas was interested in the Digital satellite transmission of films to Theaters . That would be the obvious next step in film. As a Satellite owner, I can tell you the digital broadcast I receive are far superior to basic cable. Several theaters in NY are showing the movie in a high Definition format which I'm sure are excellent,but I doubt have the sound systems that the larger houses have.",Null,0,0,30 May 1999
Citizen Kane," Towers above any film
","Much has been written about Citizen kane... greatest movie ever made, classic Etc, Etc. Nothing could come close to describe this Masterpiece. As a life long film fan, I had heard of it,but had never seen it.I finally saw it in 1990 at a theater and was truly amazed. What a twenty five year old kane did was truly monumental, If not for anything else, visually he advanced film 40 years in one stroke. no other film of it's day can compare to it's cinematic genuis. his use of deep focus, lighting and incredible editing is truly groundbreaking. the film is a study in filmmaking from a guy who had never made a film before. Welles film was to much for the audiences of his day. I frankly don't think the audiences of his day was sophisticated enough to understand what they were seeing. And of course the behind attempts by Wiliam Randolph Hearst to destroy the film are well documented. I grew up admiring a lot of film makers use of the camera, after seeing Kane I realized he used it first to create images unlike any before. In my opinion kane will alway's be the greatest film ever made because it took film to a place it had never been. Filmmakers are still trying to catch up.",Null,1,2,31 May 1999
American Beauty," Superb !!!!
","Every so often a film comes along,that unlike most others  inspire such inner thought and self reflection that it takes on a life of it's own. American Beauty is filled with such an Immense spectrum of Life it's hard to describe. On the surface Kevin Spacey plays a 42-year-old married man who's lost touch with the Beauty of life, Distant from his wife and daughter he becomes Infatuated  with her rather sensual classmate. She awakens his senses and creates some rather interesting circumstances. This by no means can relay the films deeply layered tapestry of suburban life. A brilliant Directorial debut by Sam Mendes, American Beauty will evoke discussion for years to come among film students and film lovers like myself.",Null,0,0,17 November 2000
Titanic," Titanic Achievement
","I must say, I'm rather amazed at the negative comments that have been submitted to IMDB. I strongly disagree and in my opinion any serious student of film and no I don't mean people that went to film school, upon viewing this film wouldn't be struck by it's  true greatness. Towards the end of the film  Bill Paxton's character states that while he was involved very strongly in the search for titanic's treasures 'He never let it in'. That is What Cameron has achieved above all else,Writing a story that brings the passengers of the ill fated liner to life. We of course all have heard the story of the Grand Ship that was at the time the Technological marvel of it's day. It's tragic sinking at the hands of an Iceberg in the North Atlantic was a huge blow to Man's quest to conquer nature. Cameron could have easily written a cheesy screenplay and turned it into a 70's Disaster movie, but he has created characters you care about. I've always found that films that have a huge box-office are easy targets for people to criticize, in general most blockbusters don't garner the acclaim that Titanic did. The Box office in America and around the World was unlike any before it, and I suspect it will be a long while before a film will come along to achieve what it has. TITANIC is The Gone With The Wind of our generation, that from NY Times critic Janet Maslin, and I whole Heartedly agree!!!!!",10,0,3,13 May 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," A Masterpiece!!!!
","This is simply the definitive American film about the endurance of the human spirit.A wrongly convicted man spends twenty years in a brutal prison, never losing his hope for freedom. A beautifully written and directed film by frank Darabont.A true representation of what the art of film can be elevated to. One of the greatest films ever made.",10,0,0,23 December 2000
