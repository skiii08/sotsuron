Saturday Night Fever," only the music made it worth looking
","The dance scenes and the music in Saturday Night Fever kept me watching to the end. Where I live they have movies from the 30's to 80's  each week. This week was Saturday Night Fever.Perhaps I saw this on TV years ago without foul words. But the subplots about his family not giving him any credit, the brother leaving the priesthood  could have been written a little better. And I was a girl and saw how Tony ate that food, I'd be gone in a heartbeat!.   Too many unreal things in the subplots combine with filthy words, turned me off to to film. The Dancing saved it. He was great with on the dance floor and at the studio which kept me to the end.for films of this kind i'd give it a kind 5 ( 1 out of 10) magictrain",Null,0,0,29 August 2004

The Silence of the Lambs," Edge of your seat
","This film keeps on on the edge of your seat. I rate it 9 of 10 'cause without giving away anything there is just one thing I did not like about the film. however that 1 thing is minor. You can understand why it is one of the few films to win all 4 big oscars for actor, actress director and picture",9,0,0,23 March 2003
A Walk to Remember," A Surprise
","After debating on to buy this or not, I finally went ahead and took the plunge. As it starts , I sit there going naaa....then the pick gets a better--then the bombshell hits when Mandy Moore says something that for those who never saw, I will not spoil. Despite what happens the ending gives a uplift and you see you 1 event can make you a better person. And for that reason I gave it it 8 out of 10.-magictrain California",8,0,0,23 October 2003
