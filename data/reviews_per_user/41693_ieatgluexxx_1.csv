Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The Worst Movie Ever
","If I could give this movie a 0 out of 10 I most certainly would. And I didn't hate it because it wasn't P.C. The movie was not funny. It was the lowest-brow movie that could have ever been thought up. There were a few scenes where I just wanted to throw up, or curl into a ball and die. I rented this movie, but if had paid to see it in a theater, I might have thrown my Dr. Pepper at the screen.My advice? NEVER SEE THE MOVIE. You'll be a better person because of it. If you absolutely MUST see it, watch it alone, with no one else, especially family. Be advised, this movie may not even be appropriate for some 18 year olds, when they say rated 'R' for 'graphic nudity' they are seriously not kidding.Bad writing + bad filming + disgusting 'bit jokes'= Borat, even worse than Ishtar, Catwoman and Gigli COMBINED.",1,6,12,24 March 2007
