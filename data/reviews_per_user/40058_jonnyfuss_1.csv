United 93," Intense and thrilling
","An intense, suspenseful movie from start to finish! Even though you 'know how it ends', it is an incredible movie all the way until the final frame. The film draws you into the lives of those involved and you find yourself on the edge of your seat throughout. It has been nearly 5 years since 9/11 and this film causes you to remember the events as if they just happened. I can understand why some aren't ready for this type of movie yet, but it brings back into focus the mission our country has been on since that fateful day. I highly encourage you to see this film!The fact that the cast is composed of people who are virtually unknown allows you to focus on the characters portrayed instead of the actors and their individual performances.All aspects of the film are excellent. The sound, the score, the editing, the cinematography, everything!Expect to be moved.",10,4,9,28 April 2006
