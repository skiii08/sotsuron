Blade Runner 2049," THIS MOVIE HAD NOTHING THAT THE ORIGINAL BLADE RUNNER HAD
","Ford and Olmos must have needed the money. But they get the 2 stars.
This movie was boring and made me fall asleep a few times.They tried to mimic Jean Giraud's style, but had to settle for old Star Wars instead. Peter and the Wolf ? .......WTF ?Jared Leto should have stayed home. He knows his part was in the toilet, and he had little turds floating around him in the movie to prove it.So in order to make it better, they added some nudity ? Oh yeah, that makes it better alright. FAIL !!!!!!I waited well over a year to see this movie and found that my theory is not wrong. Sequels Suck !!!!",2,2,3,18 January 2018
