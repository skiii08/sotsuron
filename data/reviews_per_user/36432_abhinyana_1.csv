Ghost," My opinion of 'Ghost'
","Long before I saw the movie, 'Ghost' ~ which became probably my favorite movie ~ I had said that this is how it happens; some people die so suddenly and unexpectedly that they don't realize they're dead; they can see and hear everything here, but cannot be seen or heard by anyone except people with a special sense of clairvoyance or something of that kind. Now, to be in that state, not understanding what's happened, and trying to communicate with people they can see and hear but getting no response, must be a most miserable condition; just think how it is to be 'sent to Coventry' in this world, by people around us, even for only an hour or a day: not a pleasant feeling at all! And this, I think, is the rationale behind the funeral ceremonies performed for the dead ~ or should be. That movie strengthened my conviction that this is so. I recommend watching it with this idea in mind; it makes a lot of sense; it would be interesting to know of the research that went into the making of this film. If someone could enlighten me about this, I would greatly appreciate it.Thanks,Abhinyana.(abhinyana@hotmail.com)",10,3,4,28 June 2006
