The Longest Yard," One Word, Horrible!
","If I have to even hear a commercial for another sports movie I'm going kill the producers! This movie was just horrible! I can't believe Adam Sandler anymore. Hes a sell out with this remake not to mention Spanglish. He is just annoying now. The Longest Yard is full of stupid, corny and annoying scenes and jokes. I despise football. Its the worst sport ever invented. On top of them showing it on TV twenty-four hours a day seven days a week during the fall, people go out and make stupid movies about it, like this one. If you like pathetic movies that critics rave they are so great when there not, go see this piece of garbage.",1,3,6,22 October 2005
The Big Lebowski," Pure Gold!!!!!!!!!!
","This movie is pure gold! I love this movie! First off it takes place in the early nineties. Anytime a movie takes place in between the years of 1970-1994 its got my attention. Its also a comedy. I am a comedy freak. I love comedy, comedy is my life. This is real comedy, the funny stuff. One thing I love about this movie that I haven't heard anybody else say is that the movie had thee perfect music to it. Fantastic music throughout the whole film. My favorite characters were The Dude (Of course) Walter and Donny. I am a fan of all three of the actors who played those parts, Jeff Bridges, John Goodman and Steve Buscemi. Poor Donny was always being told to shut up by Walter. The Dude was mixed up in the other Jeffery Lebowski's problems and Walter threw his undies out the car window and wants them back from those Nazis. Those three pal's sport was bowling. I've actually enjoy it as well. Some other people I had noticed in the movie were Tara Reid as Bunny, Dom Irrera as the driver and Jack Kehler as Marty. I'm also fans of them. To wrap this whole thing up I want to say if you haven't seen this movie and you want to see a great comedy about a guy whos just trying to get by in life, watch The Big Lebowski starring Jeff Bridges.",10,1,2,16 September 2005
Shrek," I Despise This Film
",I hate this piece of garbage film. Absolutely hate it. This give comedy a bad name. I can't take anybody anymore. Everybody loves it and everybody wants to watch it over and over again because they say they never get bored of it. This movie was corny and disgusting. Mike Myers has got to be one of thee worst comedians of all time. He has never appeared in a movie that I don't hate. He is just so irritating. I used to like Eddie Murphy back in the eighties when he was talented but he ruined his reputation with some of his later movies. I was so angry when they came out with Shrek 2 and now I found out there making a third. What the Hell? Kill this stupid irritating movie.,1,21,49,9 November 2005
