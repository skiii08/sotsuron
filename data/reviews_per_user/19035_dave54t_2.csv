Black Swan," terrible story teller
","Black Swan is the story of a young ballet dancer promoted to the role of the ballerina and the way she and her companions deal with her move from being a member of the group to the prime role. To perform her role, she needs to have the kind of passion that apparently, she doesn't have, or at least not enough. The story is hence a story of transformation: how a fragile, restrained naive girl turns into a passionate beast. The team that carries the movie on its shoulders is remarkable. From Natalie Portman to the sexy and provocative Mila Kunis, and the surprising up- to-now action actor, Vincent Cassel, who is doing great job. what prevents this film from becoming a good film is the story. the short version: the story sucks. the long version: first, it is boring. really. simply boring. second, and not unrelated, it takes talent to convince your audience that what they see is actually something completely different. The sixth sense is like that. While the story line here is completely different, still, things happen here and then - surprise- it is not like that! the scriptwriter did not even try to pretend. you see something and then ha-ha- no, it is something different! why? how? who? never mind! really shame.",3,0,1,24 March 2011
Shutter Island," what was the problem with this film?
","On its face, this film has all the right ingredients: great cast, the acting was superb, the story well told, there is a twist which i did not see coming- and still, when it was over, I felt as if something was missing. I saw it few times, and the feeling that something was missing did not go away. so what was it? and then, two nights ago, when I saw part of it, again, it struck me: the twist did not make things that happened throughout the film- sensible. let me explain: the sixth sense told a story that was engaging and well played. and then came the twist, and you said: woo... right!!! that explains! and seeing it the second time, things that in the first time went unnoticed, made so much sense now... all of the sudden you saw things that you did not really pay attention to when you saw it for the first time. Knowing the twist just added to the pleasure when you watch it again. That component is missing from Shutter Island. Nothing throughout the story evolves from the twist (when you watch it again), and the twist shed no new light on the events that took place up to that moment. The twist doesn't give new meaning to scenes played before it. on the contrary- the script up to the twist aim to confuse you and to make you think that you see the real thing. and when you see (watching it the second time) the cop that turned out to be something else, you don't see him differently. he is still the same cop that will turn out to be... something else. So while the twist does give different meaning to the story, it has no real depth. But nonetheless, it is a very good film, and you do want to see it.",8,0,1,16 May 2011
