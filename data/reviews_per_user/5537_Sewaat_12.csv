Who Framed Roger Rabbit," An Untouchable Classic
","As someone who doesn't particularly enjoy cartoons as much as I did when I was younger, it really says a lot when I look at a film like Who Framed Roger Rabbit as an adult and say that I absolutely love it. I was first introduced to WFRR when I was very young. (Probably 5 or 6 years old.) And I don't remember much from it, but what I can recall for sure is that I did enjoy it. But now that I'm grown up, I actually enjoy it even more.It's a phrase we hear all the time and more often than not, it gives us false hope that the film will be exactly as it promises: 'Fun for the whole family!' they tell us. But most of the time, movies that try to sell by using this title are false advertising and end up as unmemorable failures for both young and old audiences. But you can rest easy because this is not the case with WFRR.For starters, the tone of the story itself is a masterful combination of family friendly humour and dark euphemisms that are so complex they will go right over a child's head. So adults can appreciate them without fear of their kids becoming tainted by suggestive themes. It is perfectly equated in the light as well as the dark side of humanity. And that is something that is not easily achieved by an ordinary film, much less one that is partially geared towards children.There's a whole multitude of things that I could give this film praise for. To name the best ones: there's the skillful animation, the seamless interaction of the human characters with their toon counterparts, the clever themes of a classic 1940's film noir that blend absolutely beautifully with the cartoonist nature of the story, the top-notch acting from Bob Hoskins, Christopher Lloyd and others; and last but not least, the pain-staking amount of detail made to every single interaction between man and toon. Over all, the techniques used worked to excellence and don't fail to astound even by today's standards. You can almost feel the animator's blood, sweat and tears through every great effort to convince us that these toons are real and are just as human as their living, breathing co-stars.Because I consider the film to be so nearly perfect, there is very little that I could complain about (and I don't think I could even if I tried!). Sure, there are some scenes that might come off as a tad out-landish or zany but hey...that's the nature of cartoons. And when used in combination of brilliant acting that's so faultless to the point that you constantly forget that the actors on set are interacting with things that never actually existed; it gives you a better appreciation for cartoons and 2D animation in general but also for the extremely talented cast who gave it their all to make these gimmicks a success.As a whole, the film is staggering in both technical achievement and story. It has a lot of heart to it, great humour and a wonderfully crafted script. If you're looking for a film that both fully grown adults and small children will like, this is the real deal. There's no false advertisement to be found here; you don't get any more genuine than this. Everyone should give Who Framed Roger Rabbit a watch because you won't find more fun anywhere else!",9,2,2,6 July 2015
Star Trek Into Darkness," A Sequel that surpasses it's predecessor
","Though somewhat controversial, J.J Abrams Star Trek Reboots are masterfully well crafted and Into Darkness is certainly no exception.This film definitely brings it's name sake to the Trek Universe. It delves into darker and more intense territory than previous. The most striking thing that I noticed about this film was how seamlessly universal themes of love and sacrifice bleed out from the real world and into the fictional realm of this story. One of the very first scenes involves a dying child with her frightened parents at her side. The exchange that follows forces us to imagine ourselves in the same situation. What are the limits of your compassion? Would you do anything to save the ones you love? It's amazing to me that a simply science fiction film can ask such profound and philosophical questions such as these.The film certainly has heart but it doesn't falter in other aspects either. This is truly a beautiful film. The cinematography and colour palette's certainly please the eye. This film takes us to a few different locations and each one feels as vibrant and real as the last. The acting is superb as well. The cast from the first film all come back to reprise their respected roles, along with some great new comers too. Benedict Cumberbatch in particularly gives a powerful performance as Khan. A super-human terrorist hell bent on revenge. His brutal and icy demeanor is extremely intimidating. He is doubtlessly one of the best movie villains of the 21st century.Star Trek: Into Darkness takes every stake and risk to the next level. It's a thrilling and excellent sequel to an equally rock-solid reboot. The characters are more fleshed out and expanded upon and the threat of danger is cranked to the maximum. I really enjoyed this one and I'm sure fans of the 2009 film will too.",8,2,5,31 December 2013
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," An explosive cartoon for adults
","What can I say about this film, other than it was just extraordinarily great? It is totally unique in it's place on the cinematic scale, unparalleled by any comedy or cold war drama that came before or after. The movie's best strength by far is it's cast. All of the best players are here and they hold nothing back: Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, Slim Pickens, Sterling Hayden...they all play such diverse characters. Each of them are all so utterly insane in their own ways and yet so believable. How each actor managed to do this with such expertise is beyond me. Funny enough, the story is still just as relevant now as it was back in it's hay day. One would think that because the cold war is long over, the film would start to show it's age. But the reality couldn't be farther from. Audiences both young and old continue to find enjoyment in this film. The endearing and politically charged script rolls off the tongue so fluidly and makes for a sharp, viewing experience no matter what your age or historical expertise may be. It is this value which I believe has made Dr.Strangelove feel ageless. And like most timeless films, the themes of the film are universal. Every citizen of every nation in the world knows and understands the effects of war and how damaging they are to society. Which is why so many people resonate with the paranoia and anxieties that these characters bring to to the story. Dr.Strangelove is no less than a brilliant masterwork of film making. It is a fuming concoction of raging testosterone, American patriotism and gruesome comedy. All of this contrasting with the very real threat of nuclear war makes for a very efficient and cathartic story. The film's only weakness would be that it is certainly not to everyone's tastes. But then again, no Kubrick film is.",9,1,4,24 February 2014
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," My personal favourite of the original trilogy
","Newcomers and Fans alike often misjudge or overlook Return of the Jedi as being the weaker film of the original trilogy. And usually for very trivial reasons. However, I have reason to believe that this film has become criminally underrated. By far the biggest and most major improvement that keeps Jedi separate from A New Hope and Empire is the rapid character development of Luke Skywalker. It cannot be denied that his skill with the force has doubled, if not tripled since the last film. For lack of a better term, he is a bad-ass in every sense. The fight on the Sail Barge in the first act is intense right until the end. Luke continues to grow and test his power as the film goes on. But that's just his development for his physical abilities. Internally, Luke has become far more mature and wiser than he was in the previous two films. He makes smarter decisions, doesn't act so rash and is considerably less 'whiny' than he was thought to be in episode's IV and V. The visual effects have improved vastly since the last film. It was only a three year difference, but you can really see it. There are more stunts, more spectacles and more work put into the light saber effects. It's overall, a step ahead from it's predecessors. Not a very large step, but a step towards improvement nonetheless.Han Solo and Leia's relationship comes full circle. And it's a beautiful thing. The writers managed to execute a romantic sub-plot without it being campy or unnecessary. It's really satisfying to see them being reunited, after all of the childish feuding they went through in the first two movies. It's a nice touch to the last chapter of the trilogy.The trio of confrontation between The Emperor, Vader and Luke is extremely climatic. Everything comes together in this last act. The light saber duel between Luke and Vader is the most passionate of the trilogy. It is far more psychological than previous light saber duels, making it one of the most dramatic and symbolically powerful. The ending celebration on Endor is light hearted and leaves you with a feeling joy. It's the perfect ending to a near perfect trilogy.Although Return of the Jedi is not a perfect movie and it lacks the same excitement that The Empire Strikes Back contained so well; Jedi is my favourite because it's a more quiet and subtle Star Wars film. At times it plays more like a Shakespearean drama than it does an sci-fi film. But I don't believe that's a bad thing. If anything it helps to further enhance Jedi's flavour and further solidify it's unique place in the franchise. Jedi is a terrific ending to an awesome Trilogy. I pity those who fail to see it's under-stated brilliance.",8,2,6,10 May 2014
The Shining," My Favourite Horror Film
","Show any conspirator a Kubrick film and they can give you a theory to match it. But few films of have ever sparked more confusion, frustration or controversy among theorists than The Shining.One hesitates to even call it a film. Because it's so much more than that. It's an experience. I even struggle to call it a horror film. It's story seems to transcend reality itself and delve deep into the workings of an unsteady mind. There is something very dubious, dangerous and deeply personal about this movie that is very difficult to define. But I think I speak for everyone when I say that there is no escaping the unsettling paranoia when one feels while viewing this film. It equates to the anxious feeling one experiences when feeling as though they are being watched, even though they are alone. The disquieting tones of the film do little to put the audience's mind at ease. During it's over two hour run time, we have to endure the harshest psychological mind games that visual story-telling can abide. From a setting standpoint, The Overlook hotel is so much more than it appears to be. It's a danger zone for paranormal energy and madness. Helplessly watching the characters of the film slowly lose their grip on sanity is terrifying to watch and yet we don't dare look away. As the story carries it, it begins to reveal a savage father's hatred for his family, and ghosts and spirits coax his inner demons out from where he tried to bury them until they take their hold on him altogether. The Shining is more than a simple movie. It's an experience unlike any other, one that may make you feel as though you are descending into delirium. But it is well worth it. Watching it once is not enough. You have to watch it a few, even several times before you can finally understand all of it's complex and inter-woven concepts. And even then, no one can really say for sure what the film is trying to say. Though we have tried desperately to decide on what it means....more than 30 years later, we still don't have a clue.",9,2,4,14 June 2014
Spider-Man," A classic childhood favourite
","Though my memories are vague, I recall seeing this film for the first time around the age of seven years old. Most clearly, I remember feeling an abundance of joy whenever this movie was put into my VCR player. And when Danny Elfman's amazing score began it's first notes with the visual of the Columbia pictures logo....I felt a rush of child-like wonder and excitement fill me. I knew I was in for a treat.What can I say about this movie, now? Well, I can tell you that some of it's bigger strengths lie in the casting decisions. And look no further than the decision to cast Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spiderman. At the story's beginning, Maguire comes off as a dork and a nerd. Exactly as he's meant to be. But when pushed to the extreme, his character can change from mild-mannered teenager to heroic vigilante when need be. It's a fantastic blend of realism and fantasy that one expects from a super-hero. And this version of Spiderman is no exception. But the actor who really over-shadows the whole production, is Willem Dafoe as Norman Osbourne/Green Goblin. His bi-polar tendencies make for an extremely shifty and mysterious performance. He comes off as being both terrifying and hilarious when the situation calls for it. If the film had not possessed the amazing talent of either of these stars, than perhaps it wouldn't have been nearly as charming.It can't be denied that the film suffers from a sprinkling of corny moments. Both from the characters and the action sequences itself. Fortunately, these silly moments are few and far between. And the drama and intensity of the story arc over-shadows anything that can be considered too over the top or ridiculous. It is the darkness that this film weaves(no pun intended)ambiguously into the plot that saves the film from becoming another 'kid-friendly' super hero bomb.Though it can be sometimes laughable and cliché in a certain light, it's without a doubt one of the more passionate super hero films to date. It underlines the moral message of courage and responsibility. Both things that turn a boy into a man as Peter comes to term with through-out the story. So, in a manner of speaking...Sam Raimi's 2002 marvel masterpiece could be considered the most elaborate coming of age story yet. Combined with the compelling spirit of what it truly means to be a hero.",8,1,2,21 April 2014
The Elephant Man," A Tragic True Story, Masterfully Told
","Those who are already familiar with the real life case of Joseph (John) Merrick, AKA The Elephant Man would know that his is a very sad story. But in the right hands, such a complicated and sombre tale would make a very powerful motion picture. Thankfully, David Lynch's 'The Elephant Man' is exactly that.This is one of the best films I've ever seen in years, without a doubt. As a simple Biopic, it lends itself well thanks to the historical accuracy which accompanies it. There's nothing worse than watching a film that's supposedly based on true account only for it to be over- flowing with inaccuracies that don't do the story justice. And while some fictitious changes were made to the story for dramatic effect, they are few and far between. The Elephant Man as a whole is very true to the real accounts in which it is based on.Victorian England was such an interesting time period. Some historians tend to glamorize it as a period of progress, which it certainly was. But this film looks at it through the eyes of someone who is incredibly unfortunate. And as a result, the scenery is gritty, dirty and full of mechanical set pieces. There isn't much humanity to be found here. It was a stroke of genius to shoot the film in stark, black and white. It gives off the sensation of looking at the film through old snapshots and photographs, as though we are looking directly into the past. Perhaps the most striking thing about the film is it's ability to throw a spotlight humanity's worst and most intolerant behaviours. One might even feel shame to know that John Merrick was treated so poorly by fellow members of the human race. But it is important that we acknowledge his suffering so we can remember that it is the content of someone's heart, not the features of their face, which we must judge someone by. This brings me to my next point. The cast of this film is superb. Anthony Hopkins shows his range as an actor who in this case, has not been cast in the role of someone sinister. His portrayal of Dr. Treves is admirable and saintly. Taking the role of the audience and responding to Merrick in a way I believe most of us would: with unconditional kindness and respect. His character is a statement which brings out the best and most noble of mankind. John Hurt completely disappears into the make up and character of The Elephant Man, giving what I believe is the best performance of his career. It must have been challenging to emote underneath such heavy prosthetics, and yet he manages to make us sympathize and support Merrick at every rise and fall of his character arc. Having been snubbed for the Oscar of Best Actor is an unforgivable sin of the Academy.This is an incredibly moving picture. I was hard pressed to hold back tears during it's final act. When seeing the story unfold through the lens of a camera, we feel more intimately close to the story and to the man himself. And if the memoirs of the real Dr. Treves are to be believed, after such a trying journey to be accepted as he is, Merrick's soulful line to him towards the end of the film is a relief to hear:'My life is full because I am loved.'",8,1,1,20 July 2016
2001: A Space Odyssey," Transcendental. Masterful. Existential
","It is a hard won struggle to put this film into words. Kubrick often left many puzzles behind in each of his films. But in the case of 2001, the puzzles are legion. This is one of the most complicated and powerful films that have ever been made. Watching it is an experience equal to being born again. It is enlightenment in film form. A beautiful insight on humankind that need not be looked at only once.Rather than breaking this film down into it's essential components and how they work, I will instead focus on what this film makes me feel. By contributing my understanding and interpretations of it, hopefully I can help you to process your own.Even now, as I type these very words I gaze up at the ceiling and ask myself what is it about this film that makes it so universally ground breaking? I'll reiterate: this film is infamously difficult to describe. But what can definitely be said is that with this film, Kubrick has conjured magic. True and real movie magic. He has gifted us with this incredible story about the human race. And like any good teacher, he instructs us passionately on who we were, who we are and where we are going. Are these not the questions in which we base our teachings on? Are these not the core principles of humanity as we know it? 2001 is light years ahead of it's time. Truly, a masterpiece of the craft of film making. It transcends all verbal description and has made a permanent place in our hearts and minds. It's not up to me to decide if this film is about God, Evolution, Extra Terrestrials or something else entirely. No interpretation is right or wrong. Kubrick has managed to combine Religion and Science Fiction into a seamless and ethereal experience. It is absolutely essential for viewing if you wish to become a film maker. And even if you do not, watch it anyway. You will be doing yourself a great disservice if you do not. 2001: A Space Odyssey is the film which holds all of life's questions and answers. Kubrick captured lightning in a bottle and we are blessed that he was willing and able to share it with us.",9,4,10,8 June 2017
La La Land," Irresistible Fun
","It's true. We've seen films like La La Land before. In the first five minutes it becomes all too clear that Damien Chazelle's Hollywood musical is trying to pay homage to all of the ones that came before it. (Singin' in the Rain, An American in Paris, etc.) However, it is exactly this that makes La La Land such a delight for audiences and film critics alike. And it heavily contributes to what could have so nearly been a bland and soulless film.Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are perfectly charming in the lead roles. They share great chemistry and play well off of one another. I was not a big fan of either star before watching this film. Watching La La Land, I get the distinct feeling that these two were made to star in this film. I can't picture anyone else playing Mia or Sebastian more perfectly. However, despite the love story that takes the fore front of the plot, this film refuses to give us the happy ending we've grown so accustomed to receiving. What a shame that one of the films freshest elements is also it's saddest. It's also worth noting that La La Land earned the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, an honour that was well deserved. The camera is just as much an esteemed guest in the film as the lead stars. It moves graciously with the actors and enhances the fluidity of the sequences. Beautiful lavender sunsets, a gorgeous planetarium full of starlight and colours that dance and sparkle in the street lights all come to life in this amazing, vibrant story.I loved La La Land and I am not ashamed of it. It's not a new story by any means, but it is criminally fun and oh so very hard not to become swept up in it's astounding melodies. The criticism for it is understandable, but we should never be made to feel guilty for the films we enjoy. So if your feet start tapping to 'Another day of sun' or 'City of Stars', then by all means, enjoy it to your hearts content. Film is art. Art is subjective. Never stop falling in love with what makes your soul sing and your heart race.As a musical, La La Land succeeds in a land slide. But do not forget that this is also a film about winning, losing, love, heartache and most importantly...a film about dreams and those who are brave and foolish enough chase them.",9,5,11,27 February 2017
Beauty and the Beast," Essentially, a perfect remake
","When this film was first announced, skepticism was of course running rampant. The original animated film from 1991 is widely considered a masterpiece and one of Disney's best films. Doing the story justice with real actors of flesh and blood was going to be a challenge. That was no secret. So how does the finished film compare to the original? Thankfully, I found Bill Condon's take on the 'tale as old as time' to be surprisingly refreshing. It's a great new spin on a story we're all familiar with. But by taking elements from the original that worked well the first time and changing what did not, this adaptation of Beauty and the Beast is easily what I consider to be the most successful Disney remake we've seen yet.For the most part, the film takes the setting of it's story very seriously. Costumes and sets are all tailored and designed to perfection. And similar to Cinderella (2015), the film feels more like a period piece then a live action spin on a cartoon. The production design team were clearly trying very hard to make you believe that this is 1770's France and I think they definitely succeeded. There is some great craftsmanship at work here. This might seem like only a minor aspect of the overall spectacle, but Disney has run into some trouble before in terms of accurately representing history. Needless to say, that was scarcely a problem in this film. One of the most prevalent things about this film I can say for it is that it has one of the most superb casts I've seen in a long while. Say what you will about Emma Watson's singing abilities, but she certainly looks the part of Belle, if nothing else. She is beautiful, intelligent and strong. Everything that we loved about Belle in the original translates nicely to this version. But the actor who deserves the most of my praise is Luke Evans as Gaston. Right from the moment he was announced, I knew he would be nothing but phenomenal in the role. And I was happily correct. Evans brings a fierce intensity to the character that was not present in the original. Gaston, it seems was a part that he was born to play.Other noticeable performances include Josh Gad as Gaston's meek side kick, Lefou; a side villain who is greatly improved upon in this version; and Kevin Kline as Belle's father, Maurice. He brings a quiet and sincere quality to the character, contrasting greatly with his over-the-top persona in the original. Dan Stevens is also quite excellent as the cursed Prince. Having no prior knowledge of the actor's previous works, I was nervous to see how he would deal with playing such a complex character. Thankfully my worries were put to rest over the course of the film. He exudes a lot of humanity and charm through layers of CGI and has a strong singing voice to boot.In my humble opinion, Beauty and the Beast is a nearly perfect remake. It changes what didn't work before and keeps what did. It adds new songs which are as equally powerful as the old classics we know. The care, love and attention to detail is hugely apparent in every scene. It is a well crafted and high spirited effort to bring a beloved animated feature to life. Now that the next string of Disney remakes have been revealed, we may soon experience a new and prosperous period for the company, one with more momentum and success than the Disney Renaissance. But for now, let Beauty and the Beast serve as the example for how to make a proper and successful remake that doesn't lose any of the heart of it's predecessor. It's a charming, emotional and passionate story that will always be adored for all time.",8,7,11,10 June 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," An Exciting Return to an Amazing Saga
","When I go to the movies, I aim to experience one thing: escapism. Even if it's for only two hours, I like to occasionally escape this often unfair world we all live in and lose myself in a fictional adventure. And I think I speak for both the young and the young at heart when I say that Star Wars has brought escapism to audiences all over the globe and for many generations over the past 40 years.I was born in the mid 1990s, so I never had a chance to experience the original Star Wars trilogy on the big screen and this was something that I had a hard time accepting ever since I was a child. I never thought I would be able to see Luke Skywalker, Han Solo or Princess Leia on the big screen ever in my life time. So you can imagine my excitement when I found out that they were making another Star Wars film that was not only inventing an entirely new cast of fresh faced characters, but was also bringing back the cast from the original films, who that of which have not walked on a Star Wars set for over 30 years. So it brings me great delight to be able to tell you that the most recent installment in the franchise did not disappoint.The new characters of the film are all fully developed and come with their own strengths and insecurities. They don't clash with the old cast, but instead melt beautifully with them in every scene. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac and Adam Driver all do amazingly well. The old cast of course are all stellar too. They slipped back into their respected characters so seamlessly, it feels as though no time has passed at all.I was already familiar with J.J Abrams directing style going into this film. He, once again...does not fail to impress. This film is rife with stunning cinematography. The various locations are as gorgeous as they are aesthetically pleasing. CGI is used in this film, but to my relief it does not overpower the organic and practical effects. The environment in which these characters are staged in feels so authentic and believable, you feel as though you are a part of the journey yourself. It's instantly apparent that this film was made by a man who loves Star Wars just as much as we do.Overall, the film is a triumph. It's a wonderful collaboration of new and old filming techniques that combine beautifully to create the ultimate Star Wars film that everyone can enjoy. It doesn't matter if this is your first experience with the Star Wars saga, or if you've watched all of the films one hundred times over, fans both new and familiar will equally appreciate the love and care that was tirelessly thrown into this dazzling, epic adventure. I anxiously await the next installment.",8,60,98,7 June 2017
The Wizard of Oz," Timeless and Immortal
","What can I say about this film that hasn't already been said? Well, not much. But it seems a sin that I've never written a review for the most beloved film of my childhood. So I'll do my best to keep this original.I first saw the film, like many others did....when I was very young. It was probably the very first feature film I ever laid eyes on. Since then, it's been my most watched film. I have very distinct memories of watching it as a very young girl. No less than 4 or 5 years old and being absolutely entranced by it. I know every line of dialogue by heart. I could quote the film forwards and backwards. Needless to say, I am extremely familiar with it.Even as I got older, I never lost my respect for it. I always felt it was special, even in my teenage years. This film is my safe haven when I'm sick or mentally unwell. It instantly comforts me with warm, fuzzy feelings of nostalgia. I put it on and suddenly I'm a kid again.I cannot help but smile while watching it. I am a fully grown adult woman now. But that doesn't make me anymore immune to the film's wonderful charms. The Wizard of Oz can melt the heart of even the toughest critic. Of that I am dead certain.But how does it hold up today? Well, I'm sure you can already guess my answer to that. This film does not show it's age. It's well paced, well acted, well scripted and well designed. Be it 1939 or 2016, it made no difference. Time has not varnished this classic film. Not. One. Bit.Is it a perfect film? No. In fact, there are a few scenes I would omit. However, I feel it would be inappropriate to rate it any less than 10 out of 10. And the few errors that are present, I can easily forgive. Just because a film is imperfect does not mean it is any less deserving of praise. There is, after all....no such thing as a perfect film.This is definitely a feel good movie. It's also highly addicting. You can watch it over and over again and never grow tired of it. Such rare magic was captured on the screen here that I doubt will ever be caught again. The songs will stay with you forever, as will it's wonderful, underlying message. Because whenever I turn this movie on, I feel like I'm home again. And as we know....there's no place like it.",10,6,7,2 October 2016
