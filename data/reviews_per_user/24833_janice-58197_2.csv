Blade Runner 2049," No agenda, I was just bored.
","I don't want to give this movie such a low rating, because it's clearly well-made, and I understand how some people could like it.But I have to be honest. Midway through, I considered leaving the theater and getting something to eat. It's not that I was hating it or anything. But I stayed just because, well, I had bought a ticket. That doesn't happen to me a lot. I've never left a movie, save one, in my life. On the positive side, this is the first time I've ever needed to go to the bathroom during the movie, and just did that, without speeding up my walking pace at all. It was during an underwater fight scene or something. How you make a scene like that boring, I don't know, unless you're a filmmaker really concerned about your Art n' Technique and left the fun, and suspense, and wonder of just going to the movies for your audience behind a long time ago. It's not that I don't like movies like this. The original Blade Runner is one of my favorites, I've seen it many times.I just saw one review that mentioned 'pretentious and infantile'. That's an unusual combination that really made me think.",2,3,5,5 May 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Here's one for the person who dropped in from outer space to see this movie
","A movie with this much pedigree and expectation gets judged by a high standard. Me, I didn't see any of the other recent Star Wars films (I mean, none of the ones in the last 20 years or so), and I'm going to judge it the way I judge other movies, namely, did I have a good time? Was it better than whatever else I could have watched?It's well-made, as movies go, nothing glaringly wrong. Was it better than whatever else I could have watched? Well, I like this genre, and also seeing something new at the theater, but I'm okay with good shows on Netflix also, and many of those I enjoyed more. Did I have a good time? Yes. I also like it when I can go to a movie with my young teens and not be embarrassed, I'm sure they feel the same way. None of us would probably watch it again, or remember what happened very well. I think this movie would be a lot more fun and interesting, if there's someone in your life who is a big Star Wars fan, and they can turn it into an experience for you. But if you're dropping in from outer space, I don't think this movie goes on any alien top 100 list.",7,1,14,5 May 2018
