The Ring," you have GOT to be kidding me
","Well, I just watched The Ring for the first time, and it was probably the dumbest movie I have ever seen. I am a huge fan of the horror genre, and was practically raised on them. I had very low expectations for this film, and after the first ten minutes of the movie, I thought the my expectations would be proved wrong. The movie got off to a very spooky start, and then just grasped at straws for the remainder of the film. The movie starts off with two teenage girls talking about this video that kills you when you watch it, and true to horror movie form, one of them is doomed. It was a spooky setup and I was starting to look forward to seeing the rest of the film. . .only to be brought back down to my original expectations. The movie continues on from this point to follow Naomi Watts' character around as she investigates the tape. She follows all her clues, and asks a million and one questions about the tape, and those involved in the making of the tape, and then the movie ends without answering any of the questions. It really is a shame. It is the success of this film that has sent the horror movie genre on the lame downward spiral of PG-13 ghost movie after PG-13 ghost movie, and the movie was absolutely pointless, and not scary.

Dawn of the Dead," boo
","I am an ENORMOUS fan of horror movies.  They are by far my favorite genre of film.  This movie was so insanely boring, I almost fell asleep.  I know you are not supposed to take these films seriously, and I never do, I found 'The Exorcist' to be a barrel of laughs, and I was expecting a similar reaction to this film.  Well, I did not get it at all, except for like the first 15 minutes or so, when I was in stiches.  The remaining hour and a half or so, I was just waiting for it to end.  There is a period of about an hour in the film where absolutely nothing happens.  A group of survivors hole up in a shopping mall to keep safe, and uhhh well that's your movie folks.  Nothing happens from that point on, until the end.  This movie is nowhere near as consistent or as exciting as last years '28 Days Later.'  I also accept that these movies are not supposed to be realistic at all, I reinforce they are my FAVORITE films, but I somewhat expect them to be consistent.  You have some charaters who get bit, and turn into zombies within minutes, and others who take hours or days to turn.  Completely inconsistent, and it got a bit annoying.  Anyhow, go see it, if you must, hopefully you will get more enjoyment out of it than me.  But if you truly want to go to the movies, and see something funny, 'Starsky and Hutch' is still out there.",1,14,27,20 March 2004
Ocean's Twelve," dropped the ball
","In my 22 years of life, I have never fallen asleep in a movie theatre, until today. I loved Ocean's Eleven, but this movie failed at every point where the previous Ocean film was successful. It was extremely boring. It was one of those movies where a lot of stuff is happening, so you have to pay attention, but the film is so boring, it is nearly impossible to pay attention to the film. One thing this film asks you to do is pretend that the characters you are watching, are not quite the same as the characters in Oceans Eleven. First off, when Benedict comes after them demanding his money, all the characters flip out, like they are completely scared to death of Benedict, but in the first film, they behaved as though they had no fear of him. It is little inconsistincies like this tha make this film a 'wait for video' kind of movie. I was highly disappointed. It you want to watch a new fun sequel, go see Blade Trinity. 4/10",4,3,4,12 December 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," awesome flick!
","This movie was incredible....quite possibly the best yet in the star wars series.  the story was told spectacularly, and episode 3 was brilliantly set up.  i can't wait for episode 3, and i especially can't wait to see yoda kick more dark side @$$.  incredible.  exceeds all of my expectations!",9,0,0,16 May 2002
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," far better than expected
","i am not gonna sit here and try to tell you that this movie is a masterpiece or brilliant fiilmaking i went to this movie expecting to see explosions, good arnold 1 liners, and a lackluster story written solely so someone could make some cash off a guaranteed blockbuster what i got was explosions, great arnold 1 liners, and a surprisingly well written story line that fully tied up any loose ends or confusions left by the predecessors, and a set up for a sequel that everyone should want to see this was a very fun movie to watch, and arnold looked great the tx is nowhere near as exciting to watch as t-1000 was in t2 but this film had a great air about it, and successfully mixed great action with a very good story, and well timed humor the best of the 'blockbusters' so far this summer",8,0,0,2 July 2003
Spider-Man," ughhhhhhhhh!
","i just don't get it.  this movie is making soooo much money it means that people are going to see it again??  why???  this movie was sooooo boring. the storyline was weak, and the action scenes were dull.  the only thing this movie did  effectively was set up a sequel.  this movie would have been alot better if it was about 40 minutes shorter.  it was simply too long and they did not do enough with it for it to be a 2 hour movie.  boo",4,0,1,23 May 2002
Batman Begins," I still can't believe just how good this film is
","I am an enormous Batman fan, and I always have been since the first Batman comic I bought for myself when I was 8 years old. I was a fan of the other Batman movies, except of course Batman and Robin. But the one thing I always felt rang true about th e four previous films was that none of them got it right. They were entertaining, but they all tended to pick and choose what they wanted to use from the comics, and make up the rest as they went along. A perfect example of this is the fact that the original Batman film portrayed Jack Napier, AKA The Joker, as the man responsible for the death of Bruce Wayne's parents, while anyone who followed the comics knew that Joe Chill was the man with the gun.I went into this film with extremely high expectations, and after walking out of tonight's midnight showing I can honestly say I had no idea how perfect this film was going to be. All characters are perfectly cast, especially Bale. I have always felt, along with many other Batman fans that Michael Keaton was head and shoulders above the other portrayals of the Dark Knight, but Bale blew him out of the water. And make no mistake about it, in this film he truly was THE DARK KNIGHT. This is a Batman film that sticks so close to the dark roots of Bob Kane's character that it makes Tim Burton's vision look like the campy TV show from the 60s.I am not going to bother going into plot points in any way because God only knows what some sensitive person out there may consider a spoiler, but the film was virtually flawless. One of the concerns I had going into the film was that the origins of the character would be boring, much like, in my opinion, the first Spiderman film. So far in that series, Spiderman 2 was the only one that did a good job of character development without being dull, but my fears were null and void. The first 45 minutes or so of the movie dealing with Bruce Wayne's training and transformation moved by so quickly I could not believe it when Batman finally appeared on screen. I remember thinking to myself, 'Already? That was quick.' I was also delighted to see one of my favorite obscure Batman villains, Zsasz make an appearance, even if it was only briefly, and no that is not a spoiler, he did not even have a line. Could they be setting him up as a possible villain or the sequel? Who knows, there was nothing to directly imply that, but his appearance is curious none the less. But the one thing I'm sure you will all be as excited about as I am, once you see the end of the film, is to see how the one villain they do reveal to be in the sequel will be done.To sum it all up, this film was so good, it kinda makes me wish that the other films had never been made.",10,0,0,15 June 2005
