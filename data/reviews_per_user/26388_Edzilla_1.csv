Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Two Words: See It!
","Having a very fortunate chance to see The Phantom Menace in America was a dream come true. I have seen the movie twice, and I can't resist from watching it again very soon here in the Philippines on June 30. Some people expected too much in this movie that's why they're disappointed, but if you look beyond that or try to watch it again, you will accept the movie for what it is, and it's a good clean fun movie with a lot of lessons that we'll apply in life. This movie isn't about super plots, look at what happened to Deep Impact. It sucked because of more plot than action & special effects, The Phantom Menace has a lot of special effects and a plot also. There's a Queen who must defend her home planet for freedom, A mother who must give up her son to achieve his goal, A young jedi knight who will face an unimaginable evil, And a senator who wants power. It's there don't you see it? It has a story, One comment though Instead of Anakin saying 'Yipee!' in the film, I'd prefer 'Alright!' As for Jar Jar I just leave him alone.",Null,0,0,5 June 1999
