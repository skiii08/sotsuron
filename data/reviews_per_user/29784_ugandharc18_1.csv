Iron Man 3," Glimpses of sensitive side of egotistical Tony Stark
","Overall it is a must watch, highly entertaining (a) Decent amount of surprises in the plot (b) Sensitive side of Tony Stark (c) Intelligent use of Armor.Iron Man 3 tried to play the same humor shown in avengers, at some point it sounded clich√©, though it has some fine moments. Starks ego is toned down compared to other prequels, but surprises with glimpses of his sensitive side. Use of weaponry/gadgets is more intelligent, less flashy, plot has some humorous side to it, villain seemed powerful but powers were loosely defined. Like other iron man movies, plot is so-so, but the movie has frequent good-to-very-good moments, that makes the movie highly entertaining.",9,0,5,5 May 2013
