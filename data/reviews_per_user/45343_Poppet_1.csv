The Blair Witch Project," Completely Obsessed
","I can't believe that out of the thousand or so comments made to IMDb, most of them were negative...I must admit, this flick has captured me and I can't get enough.  I saw it tonight and ever since I got home I've been searching for fam www sites and articles. The more I learn about it the more fascinated I become with 'Blair Witch'.  Making a poppet tomorrow.I've never seen a film so raw.  I give a big thumbs up to the directors whose 'method filmmaking' made me feel like I was there lost in the woods with Heather, Josh, and Mike.  I was very surprised to see that bit of gore.. but you have to please the audience, right?I plan to go back for more.  I'm sure I missed something or other.Brilliant.  Absolutely brilliant.",Null,1,2,20 August 1999
