Requiem for a Dream," This recovering addict gives Requiem an A+
","As one who survived the sixties, but not without a 20-year addiction encouraged by the medical community, I applaud Requiem.  It is definitely one of the most harrowing movies through which I have ever sat.  And I say that as a former reviewer who sat through many movies.  The camera work, yes, is a bit arty at times.  But it serves to induce the skewered vision of the addicted. I especially related to, and appreciated, the physician-encouraged addiction of Sarah Goldfarb (Burstyn).  Poor Sarah is an innocent, naively trusting in what her doctor tells her - after all, he knows what he is doing!  She winds up as a total psychotic - but at least, a THIN psycho, which is what is important for women!  There are undertones of sexism in America, along with many others, in this film. Marlon Wayans is a delight and so is the rest of the cast.  If this is a low budget movie, it surely doesn't look like it.  Writing, acting, directing, editing, scoring - all well above average.  For women, the end scene of Harry's girlfriend's descent into the hades particular to females is so terrifying, mortifying and hellacious that it will be a long time before we get it out of our minds - if ever. The comparisons to Trainspotting are inevitable.  Trainspotting was excellent in its own right.  But Requiem is the one I think I'll never forget. Congratulations to Burstyn for going from 'Same Time, Next Year' to 'Requiem for a Dream.'  What a range!",Null,0,0,17 February 2001
