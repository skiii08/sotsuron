The Equalizer," Entertaining, but shallow
","This is a vigilante movie. A man with a dark, mysterious past, lives an ordinary life, until something wakes his older self and he starts eliminating bad guys. The premise is old and overused and there are hardly any innovations in this movie. However, it is very well made. Nicely acted, Denzel is convincing at his role and the supporting cast play their parts very nicely. Nice direction, nice soundtrack and a decent finale. No upsets, twists or surprises - No disappointments, letdowns or frustration whatsoever. It is pretty violent for children and some women were 'annoyed' by the brutality of some of the killings, but it won't give you nightmares.Overall I was entertained by this movie, fans of the genre will be pleased.",5,1,2,15 December 2014
Gone Girl," A bad book, turned int an even worse movie.
","I read the book because there was a huge sticker on it's cover claiming that it was bought by a major Hollywood studio to be made into a Ben Affleck-starring blockbuster. It claimed to be a mystery / thriller, so I gave it a shot.The first half is brutally boring, there is a major (but not unexpected) twist halfway, and it gets just as boring again, until it ends. I was disappointed by the book, but when I started reading some good reviews about the movie, I thought that the adaptation must have corrected most of its flaws. Alas, it was not to be. The movie is just as uninteresting as the book, making me wonder why on earth did I waste so much time on this ridiculous story.I never liked Ben Affleck, especially after he murdered 'Daredevil', but I liked 'Argo' and I thought that he might just be on a roll with this. Unfortunately for him, this movie is bad, and this time it really is not his fault. Don't waste your time (and money) on this.",2,5,10,14 December 2014
