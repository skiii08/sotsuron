The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," A girl cho√© to be the mocking jay. She and her friends (or army) rised to destroy the Capitol
","The story was good, but it's a little bit boring. I like Katniss, she's beautiful, brave and especially her spirit, it's so pure and bright. Peeta was handsome. The way that the Capitol used to stop Katniss's army ( or friends ), it's so cruel. The scenes seem so dilapidated. But the story was cut into many parts so it is too hard to watch all. The Capitol's clothes was so colorful. Not like Katniss's clothes. I love Katniss so much. My favourite part is when she speaks her speech in front of the camera when they were filming to encourage all the rebels to fight. And then they rescue Peeta, i don't know exactly what happened next. Because I'm only thirteen years old and in my country, to watch the hunger game, you must be 16 or more. I hope it will show on television soon, I'm so excited.",8,1,4,29 November 2015
