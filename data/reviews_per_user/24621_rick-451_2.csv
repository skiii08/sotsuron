Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," must not have gotten the humor in it
","I know I'm quite a bit in the minority on this one but I just didn't seem to think this movie was much more than some obnoxious mockery of third world countries and some fraternity-type humor. I don't think Borat does much at all for pointing out bigotry or antisemitism as much as he simply sensationalizes those same problems at the expense of blind sighted participants being told this was a real documentary. Never liked Ali G. either. Sorry to say I really believe all the critics are wrong. It's not a satire or black humor or much more than crass foolery to me. I think he should cough up some hard cash to Glod, Romania and be a sport about it too. My apologies for possibly appearing self righteous but I do believe there are much better ways to approach the obvious societal problems presented in the movie. Look at Woody Allen or Lenny Bruce performances for example as ways to tackle these issues.",Null,5,10,27 November 2006
Deja Vu," thoroughly enjoyed this movie
","Even better than expected after seeing the previews, not at all what is suggested, that it's kind of a mind game thing. great effects, shooting style, very sci-fi , but not corny, and of course Denzel Washington approved as I'm sure he has his contributions to the story and the character he plays. Beautiful female lead too. It has a bit of a love story, but it's really more of an infatuation with another character,and in that light, you won't be disappointed that it doesn't develop completely, just enough to tie the story together. Don't let anyone talk about the story in detail, good chance of spoiling it. Val Kilmer adds a bit, I actually like his character, different than other parts. highly recommend it.
