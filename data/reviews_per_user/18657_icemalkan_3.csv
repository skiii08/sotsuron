Conquest 1453," Just shooting a character in slow motion doesn't make the scene dramatic
","First of all the score of the movie is just emotional given by Turks, doesn't reflect the quality of the movie. Well especially for the epic movies the main target is usually building an emotional tie between the audience and the hero. The director totally failed in this issue, after 160 minutes still the heroes are strangers and I think the director thought just by shooting the heroes in slow motion would move the audience :) Really bad script, very very cheap dialogs that bore you to hell, overused replica special effects. But there is a successful part of the production and that is the advertisement. Just the expected result of the long durational empty Turkish TV Series to the cinema, writers just write to pass the time.",5,3,6,10 December 2012
The Descent," weak story, meaningless lines, 6 girls and gollum
","Cheap conversations between characters...Is it the only way to scare the audience: every time one of the girls look deep in the dark one of her friends come from behind to scare her, but every time. Lack of originality... Nothing new; even the creatures are 'gollum' but this was the best part of the film. At least for a moment you remember a good movie...The only part you feel the tension is the part you recognize you waste your 99 mins to watch probably the worse film you'll ever see.The producer should be very talented in computer networks because i cannot imagine any other explanation for that incredible rating except that he hacked the IMDb database...",1,92,162,20 February 2006
Me Before You," A bowl of clich√©s served with Emilia Clark's overacting
","In the first half an hour, you'd think that this is a changed version of The Intouchables but as you move on it makes you wish it were. Progress is very predictable like if it was written with a recipe. It's really hard to believe that this movie is based on a book. It's even harder to believe that this is a British Comedy. The boyfriend character! In every five minutes the author points out how stupid and selfish he is. Everything is told by yelling in this story, everything is exaggerating Emilia Clark's awfully overreacting. Probably the best proof that her career will go down as soon as Game of Throne's over, can't keep up with Sam Claflin. If you haven't seen The Intouchables, better spend that 2 hours watching that.",2,3,17,8 August 2016
