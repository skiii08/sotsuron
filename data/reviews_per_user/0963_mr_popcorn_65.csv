Scarface," McCheesy's take on 'Scarface'
","Tony: Look at dem pelicangs fly! An update of the 1932 film, Scarface (1983) follows gangster Tony Montana and his close friend Manny Ray from their trip on the Cuban Boat Lift for refugees to their arrival in Miami. After killing a powerful Cuban figure, Montana and company gain the ability to leave their refugee camps and roam around the U.S. After unsuccessfully trying to make it legitimately in the country, Montana and Ray resort to selling cocaine to dealers around the world. Tony's rise is quick, but as he becomes more powerful, his enemies and his own paranoia begin to plague his empire Before I go on with my review, let me just say that Al Pacino is one scary dude. I wouldn't be messing around with him because as he aptly said, 'You mess with me! You mess with the best!'. I mean, even to the last minutes of his colorful drug-induced life, he stood there and took the bullets like it was nothing. It was really looking to be the best, most badass way to die that is until some Terminator wannabe hack creeped behind him and loaded Tony with a 12 gauge shotgun. That scene along with the forever classic 'Say hello to my LITTLE FRIEND!' was one of the most violent, visually amazing, bullet orgy I have ever seen in the history of cinema.Al Pacino gives off one of his best performance ever as Cuban immigrant Tony Montana. His intensity on screen was like an earthquake, it was amazingly well done. It is rather obvious that he was really committed to playing the character, undertaking lessons to make his Cuban accent more believable and I read in one article that even off screen, he was still using the accent. Hours and hours of painstaking work and dedication until he reaped the fruits of his labor. A tip of the hat to the cast and crew of Scarface for making an unforgettable film and showed us what it really takes to achieve that 'American Dream' back in the day.",9,0,1,2 September 2008
Frost_Nixon," a powerful political piece
","Now, I'm not the kind of guy who's into politically-charged dramas. Almost 70% of the time, I sleep through them. I think the reason why that is is because I hate politics. I truly, sincerely 100% hate politics. I pay my taxes and that's it, my only valid brush with politics. So when I find out that a politically-charged drama is in the runnings for the Oscar season, my first reaction was to skip it. But then, in the immortal words of Will Smith (or is it that Lawrence guy?), the sh8t just got real. It was turning into something. The critics gave it favorable reviews and the audience even. So with that in mind, I decided to give it a try. Ron Howard needed to come back out strong after a disappointing The Da Vinci Code. Its all or nothing for him.Well, after all the hullaballu, only one thing can be said after watching Frost/Nixon: a masterpiece. Simply astounding. Compelling and powerful. Langella gives the performance of a lifetime as President Nixon. There is no doubt in mind that he'll be nominated for Best Actor in every Award ceremonies out there, including the Oscars. Langella turned Nixon into a well thought out and complex character and he even adapted the President's deep blue voice. There's some steep competition this year in the Best Actor category with Sean Penn, Brad Pitt and Mickey Rourke also in the runnings. No one really knows who's coming out on top, they're all great, but one thing is for sure, its gonna be one hell of a race.Michael Sheen on the other hand also did a magnificent job as David Frost, the fearless and ambitious journalist who defied all odds and pinned down a mighty giant. He was indeed a worthy adversary to Langella's Nixon and he is as intense as Langella in his own kind of way. Sam Rockwell and Oliver Platt plays Frost's top researchers and they were quite exceptional as well. Sam Rockwell in yet another character role supports the film with intensity and although his performance will be overlooked because of Langella and Sheen, he's still one of my favorites and his time will come soon. A talent like that, that's pretty hard to be missed. Kevin Bacon also, great showcase of talent as the right hand man to Nixon. Like Rockwell, he delivers a fine performance that cannot be missed. With a solid and gripping screenplay from Peter Morgan and a top notch directing from Howard and everybody else in between, Frost/Nixon is a film you can't afford to miss. One of 2008's finest.",9,3,6,18 December 2008
The Incredible Hulk," McCheesy's take on 'The Incredible Hulk'
","This reboot to 2003's Hulk starring Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth and William Hurt did precisely what it was made to do: to be an all out, guns-blazing, hell-hath-no-fury fighting, bone crunching summer blockbuster. The main problem with the first Hulk is that it took itself too seriously, it had more talk and less action and I'm no Einstein but the best place for a 10 foot tall, green beast is in a street duking it out with a 10 foot tall brownish abomination with spikes shooting out in his back. The reboot just did that. It may have not been a 30 minute fight scene as promised but still, we are treated with such a visual spectacle you will be on the edge of your seats until the Hulk does his trademark move, the 'HULK SMASH!'.This version of Hulk is a lot better than Ang Lee's because first, the people behind the film embraced the idea of the Hulk being a less-talk-more-action kind of guy, second, the Hulk is actually just seven feet tall in the comics not 15 feet tall like what Ang Lee depicted in his version, this film stayed true to the roots of Hulk and they stuck with a shorter, brawnier, much greener version of him and it worked out pretty well in the end. Edward Norton, always the excellent actor, was stellar in this one. His portrayal of Bruce Banner is much more melancholic, emotional, desperate and you sympathize with his plight. Eric Bana's performance was okay but I find Edward Norton's much better and not only because he is my most favorite actor of all but if you look at it really carefully, you can see that he is truly the embodiment of Bruce Banner. He really connected with the character and I'm impressed.Tim Roth on the other hand, who plays villain Emil Blonsky aka Abomination, gave a very spooky performance. He really dug in to the Emil character and it was pretty amazing. The scene where he in human form, approaches the Hulk shooting grenades at him and then goes all karate kid on him with the backflips and the hand gun, oh my god, that scene will really shake you to the bone. It shows how fearless he is and his drive to destroy Hulk will ultimately consume him in the end. Amazing performance from both the hero and the villain.Other cast mates includes Liv Tyler as Bruce's ladylove Betty Ross and William Hurt as the guy who wants to harness the Hulk's power, General Ross. Their performances were quite good. Its a step away from the performances in the 2003 version. Lou Ferrigno who played Hulk sometime ago makes a cameo as a security guard and as usual, Stan Lee, the creator also makes a special appearance as the guy who drank that Brazilian soda punch. And of course the creme de la creme of all cameos is that of Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark who makes a quick little chit chat with General Ross about this 'group'(read: The Avengers) they're making for which General Ross replies 'What group?' and Stark with a funny look in his face. It only means one thing: come 2011, I'll be the first in line in the Avengers movie, I'm already there.The Incredible Hulk is a lot better than 2003's Hulk and I can give you a 1,001 reasons why. A worthy addition to the Marvel movies collection.7/10",7,3,5,14 June 2008
United 93," McCheesy's take on 'United 93'
","Such a powerful film. Director Paul Greengrass recreates the events that happened in the tragic day of 9/11 and he got it spot on. It is so accurate sometimes I'm having a feeling that I'm watching a documentary. Everything in it looked so real, from the air tower controllers to the shaky cam approach, all these techniques were used by Paul Greengrass to his advantage.The actors did quite well also. I heard somewhere that before production started, Paul Greengrass separated the protagonists from the antagonists, from the hotel rooms to the acting workshops, he isolated one from another to get that strange feeling from the actors. To be honest, it worked quite well. The result is outstanding.The ending will leave you speechless. The struggle that happened is just too hard to take as a whole. You need to take it one at a time but the director shoved it right down our throats, we didn't even have time to talk nor breathe. It just happened and then fade to black. No questions asked. The film's ending will go down as one of my favorite and this film will go down as one of 2006's best film. A must-see.",10,3,6,21 June 2008
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," ET...Phone home...
","ET is a true classic and definitely one of the greatest family movie ever made. Scratch that, ET is the best family movie ever. ET is a kids movie yes but ET also brings the kid out the adults. It captures that piece of your childhood where times are dire and where special bonds develop in difficult times. A touching and heart warming film that will make you cry, it will make you laugh and if you're an adult, will bring you back to that nostalgic place where the most special of things happened to you for the first time.What makes ET a more memorable piece of work is the astounding and epic scoring of John Williams. He knew where to put the symphony and then strikes if the mood is right. Add to that an almost flawless direction by Spielberg, and quite possibly one of the best movie he's ever done, ET is one memorable piece of work. You can't afford to miss this one.",9,0,1,23 November 2008
In Bruges," McCheesy's take on 'In Bruges'
","-CONTAINS SPOILERS- Ray: Don't know any Belgium jokes, and if I did I think I'd have the good sense not to...hang on. Is Belgium with all those child abuse murders lately? I do know a Belgium joke. What's Belgium famous for? Chocolates and child abuse, and they only invented the chocolates to get to the kids.The line above is only one of the several hilarious, yet sometimes offensive to some, one liners in the film. There's this other very offensive joke about a see-saw and a big fat f'ing retarded black woman but I wouldn't dare tread on that.In Bruges is funny, violent, sarcastic, witty, smart, rude, offensive, boisterous but all in all - laugh out loud fun. Colin Farrell's performance as Ray the disgruntled hit-man is so wickedly hilarious you couldn't stop laughing at his witty one liners and all that crass, rude jokes. His buddy is co-assassin Ken, excellently portrayed by Brendan Gleeson whose deep reserve for Colin's Ray takes on a whole new level when he jumps out of a bell tower to save his best mate's life. That's what I call 'brothers-fo-life' On the other hand, there's the villain boss Harry, whose demeaning stature and ruthless persona perfectly fits the actor who plays him: the demeaning and ruthless Ralph Fiennes.'In Bruges' is one of those films that's so good you probably haven't even seen it yet.",8,0,3,21 June 2008
Star Trek," Live long and prosper...
","Abrams and crew went above and beyond my expectations and completely blew me away with fascinating visual effects, top notch music and high grade acting. Just like what Nolan did to Batman, JJ Abrams breathed new life to a dormant franchise and one can assume that this is where things will kickstart for Captain Kirk and his Enterprise crew. Having seen this one, I am all for a Star Trek 12 and I might even buy the classic series and the preceding movies. JJ Abrams, also the director of underrated action piece Mission Impossible 3, definitely has an eye for action and escapist storytelling and this movie might just be his hot ticket to greater movie projects.I've had my reservations with Chris Pine playing Kirk because to be honest, no one really knew him and the fans were worried if the new Captain Kirk will work or not. Well, fortunately all is good and well with Chris Pine as he fills in the shoes of William Shatner. Pine's approach to Kirk brings justice to Shatner's unique portrayal while making a distinct personality that caters the new generation. Not to be outdone, Zachary Quinto of Heroes fame brings the assertiveness and gusto of Spock to a whole new level. Both of them meld perfectly on screen and the chemistry has a certain spark and charm that will be remembered by fans and non-fans alike. Tip of the hat also to Karl Urban who plays Bones McCoy, Simon Pegg as disgraced engineer Scotty, Zoe Saldana as feisty Uhura and a kickass John Cho as Enterprise pilot Hikari Sulu. Eric Bana channels some of his 'Chopper characteristics playing main baddie, Nero and for all intents and purposes, his turn as a villain was effective and three dimensional. Mind blowing visual effects and an ear piercing and stunning score by Michael Giacchino bookends this visual treat of a movie that is turning to be an early 2009 favorite among fans and critics. A must see for the summer movie season.",9,4,12,8 May 2009
Happy Gilmore," Review: Happy Gilmore
","Happy Gilmore is a failed hockey player with no direction in life. His grandmother is evicted from her house for her failure to pay back taxes, and his girlfriend has left him. He makes it on to the pro golf tour with the hope of making some money to save his grandmother's house, but is challenged by the favorites on the tour, Shooter McGavin.This is one of the better Happy Madison flicks I've seen and this one actually made me laugh. The best scene has got to be the cameo of Bob Barker who went ballistic on hot-tempered Happy Gilmore. That scene is classic and it will be remembered forever.The Happy Madison shingle has been a big disappointment nowadays with the release of vile spew Zohan and terrible unfunny Chuck and Larry. I'm glad I got to see this one because honestly, I'm starting to lose the faith with Adam's comedy posse. Let's just hope Happy Madison's next outing is a lot like Happy Gilmore and a little less of Zohan and Chuck and Larry.",7,1,2,1 September 2008
The Rocker," The Rocker
","'Opportunity rocks'The Office star Rainn Wilson portrays a drummer named 'Fish,' who gets a second shot at fame 20 years after getting kicked out of his band on the very night they signed the record contract that made them stars. Fish has spent the past two decades languishing at soul-crushing day jobs while his old bandmates became legends, continuing to grace magazine covers and dominate the radio. He might just get another chance at musical success, however, when his teenage cousin invites him to drum for his high school garage band, and they end up catching the ear of record executives. Now, Fish is determined to live the hedonistic rock & roll lifestyle he missed out on 20 years ago, but his new bandmates don't appreciate his hard partying -- and neither do his middle-aged knees. This Fox Atomic comedy co-stars Christina Applegate. Shawn Levy (Night at the Museum) and Tom McNulty co-produced the feature, which was penned by Wallace Wolodarsky and Maya Forbes, and directed by Peter Cattaneo (Opal Dream). Review I find The Rocker highly amusing, sue me. While its no School of Rock and Rainn Wilson is in no way in the league of a God that is Jack Black, The Rocker finds its way to audiences with its rockin soundtrack and the comedic power of one Rainn Wilson, who also plays one of the most lovable TV character ever, The Office's Dwight Schrute.The gags and the jokes might seem out of line at some point, but quickly recovers as Rainn Wilson's hilarious antics make up for it for the whole duration of the movie. He's fast becoming one of my favorite comedian out there. Although Rainn Wilson's attempt to promote the movie proved to be futile, Jenna Fischer being locked up in the back of his Firebird so that you will watch the movie, and quite frankly it didn't fare well in the box office which I found rather odd because the movie is a comedy. This is the kind of movie that people will actually spend their money on and just have a good time watching it, they put Beverly Hills Chihuahua in the top spot for two straight weeks and this hilarious romp didn't even make it to two weeks. Hysterical.",7,1,3,20 October 2008
The Girl Next Door," The Girl Next Door
","'Matt never saw her coming... but all his friends had!' Boy meets girl who's already met all sorts of boys and girls in this teen-slanted comedy. Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) is a straight-laced and highly ambitious high school student who plans to study at Georgetown University and dreams of a career in politics. While most of his classmates are in the throes of an epidemic of senioritis, Matthew is obsessed with schoolwork and has a hard time relaxing and having fun. But he finds himself a bit less focused on his future career when Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert), a beautiful 19-year-old blonde, moves in next door. Danielle is playful, spontaneous, and doesn't always remember to draw her shades, and before long Matthew is head over heels in love. Danielle soon finds herself taken with Matthew as well, but their relationship takes an unusual turn when he discovers that, before she moved to town, Danielle had a successful career as a porn actress. Matthew is able to convince Danielle that she's cut out for better things in life than appearing in porn videos, but his advice doesn't especially please Kelly (Timothy Olyphant) or Hugo (James Remar), two porn moguls who figure Matthew owes them big-time after convincing their leading lady to drop out of the adult industry. The Girl Next Door -- which, appropriately enough, shares its title with a 1999 documentary about adult film superstar Stacy Valentine -- also features Timothy Bottoms, Paul Dano, and Chris Marquette.Review The Girl Next Door is so full of clichés and just overloaded with cheesiness and yet, after all this I find it quite amusing. That isn't normal of me because I usually despise teeny bopper chick flicks (American Pie makes the cut among a few other classics) and surprisingly, this one makes it on top. Elisha Cuthbert exudes the eroticism and beauty of the character and yet, she didn't over do it, just the right mix. Emile Hirsch, a then unknown, equally shines as well.",8,0,0,27 October 2008
The Mummy," Quite alright
","I'll give this one a solid six. Yes, I enjoyed it quite a lot but there's something that makes this film forgettable. The action was decent, the story was there and the acting were above average. Brendan Fraser as wily adventurer Rick O' Connell is very much like Indiana Jones.Every time I saw him on screen I can't get Indiana Jones out of my head. His portrayal was fairly effective but the thought of him being an Indiana Jones character cannot be avoided.I enjoyed it yes, but this one I will probably forget in a day or two. 6 stars.(I wonder how The Mummy 3 will turn out, its not set in the desert btw)",7,0,0,11 April 2008
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," McCheesy's take on 'Hellboy II: The Golden Army'
","The mythical world starts a rebellion against humanity in order to rule the Earth, so as Hellboy and his team returns they must save the world from the rebellious creatures. Now, as the creatures who inhabit the spiritual realm gear-up for an all out attack on the human plane, the only one capable of saving the Earth is a tough-talking hellspawn rejected by both worlds.'Hellboy 2: The Golden Army' is irrefutably a whole lot better than the first Hellboy. While I wouldn't consider the first Hellboy a bad film but let's face it, that one had its fair share of 'Bad Things That Shouldn't Be in A Movie' but still I enjoyed it especially because of the dual blade wielding Nazi masked man Karl Ruprecht Kroenen. Now that's what I call a bonafide villain. That guy basically has the word 'evil' all over him. This one however, had a better villain (Sorry Karl), in the form of exiled Prince of the mythical world Nuada. He wants to control the legendary 'Golden Army' and let it wreak havoc in our planet and in order to do that, he must have the pieces of the crown that controls the indestructible army.Hellboy 2 had 10x the fun of the first one, the action was 10x grander and in epic scale and the work done in the costume design was superbly done. Visionary director Guillermo Del Toro isolated the use of CGI to correlate with the make-up and costume design of the monsters and the outcome is visually stunning. A new addition to the BPRD was more than welcome, ectoplasmic entity (Gasbag according to Hellboy) Johann Krauss voiced by Seth McFarlane who did a fine job voicing the character.One thing that you'll notice in this film (besides the much improved storyline) is that they turned the fun-factor up a notch. Even up until now I still can't get the drunken karaoke duet of Hellboy and Abe in the tune of Barry Manilow's 'Can't Smile Without You' out my noggin. What was Del Toro thinking?! It was so random and out of the blue. But I have to say, it worked pretty damn well. I lol'd.Hellboy 2: The Golden Army is a 9.",8,0,2,26 August 2008
Sleepy Hollow," Sleepy Hollow
","Ichabod Crane: 'It was an evil spirit possessed you. I pray God it is satisfied now, and you find peace. The evil eye has done it's work; my life is over, spared for a lifetime of horrors in my sleep, waking each day to grief. Goodbye, Katrina.' In the early United States of America, young policeman Ichabod Crane is sent to from New York to the fledgling settlement of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of ghoulish murders. On his arrival, the town council informs him that the three victims were killed in open ground, and the heads had disappeared - taken by a headless ghost that is supposedly responsible. Ichabod is unconvinced of this, but learns more about the ghostly horseman - it is the ghost of a Hessian sent by the British during the revolutionary war, and he was caught by redcoats and decapitated with his own sword. When Ichabod sees the ghost kill one of the town council members, his skepticism evaporates - and he soon discovers that the horseman's ghost has an unholy connection to Balthus Van Tassel, a wealthy farmer - and whose daughter Ichabod is falling in love with...I knew this film would be good before I even got to see it well for starters, its a Johnny Depp-Tim Burton collaboration who has made several films together and almost all of them, quite impressive. This one is another one of those impressive films by said collaborators. The magic of the Depp-Burton killer combo works really well when they're making dark, brooding films and the vibe alone will make you shiver. They did it with Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood and Sweeney Todd. This film is no different. Tim Burton's vision is pretty amazing when put on screen.From the enormous sets built to the small details in the costumes and the masterful screenplay by Kevin Yagher, add to that Johnny Depp's commitment to the lead role and you get a pretty amazing film.",7,0,0,12 September 2008
The Godfather: Part II," The Godfather: Part II
","Michael Corleone: 'There are many things my father taught me here in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.'Francis Ford Coppola's legendary continuation and sequel to his landmark 1972 film, The Godfather, parallels the young Vito Corleone's rise with his son Michael's spiritual fall, deepening The Godfather's depiction of the dark side of the American dream. In the early 1900s, the child Vito flees his Sicilian village for America after the local Mafia kills his family. Vito (Robert De Niro) struggles to make a living, legally or illegally, for his wife and growing brood in Little Italy, killing the local Black Hand Fanucci (Gastone Moschin) after he demands his customary cut of the tyro's business. With Fanucci gone, Vito's communal stature grows, but it is his family (past and present) who matters most to him -- a familial legacy then upended by Michael's (Al Pacino) business expansion in the 1950s. Now based in Lake Tahoe, Michael conspires to make inroads in Las Vegas and Havana pleasure industries by any means necessary. As he realizes that allies like Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) are trying to kill him, the increasingly paranoid Michael also discovers that his ambition has crippled his marriage to Kay (Diane Keaton) and turned his brother, Fredo (John Cazale), against him. Barely escaping a federal indictment, Michael turns his attention to dealing with his enemies, completing his own corruption.Review Although not as good as the first Godfather but a masterpiece nonetheless. The second chapter of the Corleone crime family is part prequel and part sequel as it chronicles the rise of a young Vito Corleone, played by a very young Robert De Niro, to Godfather status. The sequel part on the other hand tells of Michael's growing power over the Corleone crime organisation as he expands his grip from Nevada to 1950's Cuba.A lot of people claims that this film is superior to the first Godfather but I beg to differ. I still find Godfather the best ever and this one coming in at a close second. With the absence of the movie magic that is Marlon Brando as the titular gangster, the backbone and spirit of Part II is just lost but at the least a very young and then unknown Robert De Niro gave justice to the Vito Corleone character and quite possibly one of his greatest performances of all time. What tops this cinematic milestone is Al Pacino as he leads a power house cast to greatness. From Robert Duvall to Diane Keaton and a terrific John Cazale, the powerhouse acting is one of the finest I've seen. The plot is more complex and involving the second time around as it delves deeper into the Corleone's family origins and it never gets boring and overly long as some people have suggested.The Godfather II is a cinematic milestone. Highly recommended.",9,0,2,17 October 2008
Léon: The Professional," McCheesy's take on 'Leon'
","Leon is an immigrant hit-man who works for an Italian guy named Tony. He lives a lonely life only his plant accompanying him in his solace. His seemingly desolate life takes a screeching right turn when a neighboring family gets killed by crooked DEA agents. Only poor Mathilda survived the onslaught so Leon reluctantly takes her under his wing teaching her his skills as an assassin so Mathilda can exact revenge to the agents.Jean Reno plays hit-man Leon in this captivating tale of self discovery and finding that one person who gives you a taste of life. Director Luc Besson created a masterpiece. His style is unique, the flow of the story never gets in your nerves instead it gets in your heart. In the earlier parts of the film, the character Leon is established as a stone cold contract killer but as the film progresses, we realize that he is as gentle as a puppy dog. Mathilda gave him a reason to live and rediscover life again. She had given him and I quote 'A taste of life'.Superb acting from a then young Natalie Portman, Gary Oldman as the crooked DEA agent Stan was creepy as hell (as in every of his role). An interesting character sure and he's the yang of Leon's yin (or vice versa whatever). He likes his walkman (no iPod back then), he likes Beethoven...and Mozart. And he gets in a trance-like funk whenever he takes his green loopy pills. Leon on the other hand is excellently portrayed by Jean Reno. He too, is an interesting character and he will go down as one of the most memorable hit-man in cinema history. He likes his milk, he wears knitted bonnets because he can't afford to catch a cold and he has mastered the art of killing efficiently. A beast that was tamed by an 18 year old girl...13. Just like what Ann Darrow is to King Kong.Rest assured the ending will make you sad. 'Leon' is a memorable film to be remembered from here to eternity.",10,1,3,13 May 2008
Burn After Reading," What a cluster-F...
","Burn after Reading while it may not be the Coen's best effort, succeeds and hits all the right spots. A highly likable dark comedy with an intricate web of storyline and chock-full of hilarious and delightful characters makes this film a winner. It couldn't have been better with the Coen's on board, a saucy, stylish dark comedy that delivers all the punches and succeeds with the narrative and character development. The acting is superb from frequent Coen collaborators Frances McDormand and George Clooney to explosive and charming performances from John Malkovich, Tilda Swinton and Brad Pitt.Although if you sum it all up, you'll find that the plot is basically just an excuse for a movie about nothing but the Coen's made it seem like it is about a lot of things. As JK Simmons' character said in the end, 'what a clusterf-ck'.",8,3,8,24 November 2008
Armageddon," Michael Bay's Armageddon
","Plot: A huge Comet is headed for earth. As it does not consist of one big piece, but of a cloud of rather small pieces plus a main rock the size of Texas, little impacts are recorded long before the big one is scheduled for collision with earth. Harry S. Stamper and his drill team are selected to land on the main comet as they are the only ones who can work the special drill Harry developed. Their mission is to drill 800 ft. into the comet to place a nuclear explosive device. The explosion of the bomb will break the comet in two, and the two pieces will pass earth on both sides. This task has to be accomplished before a certain 'dead' line, or the comet parts will not fly by, but hit earth.The movie, has its few pros and cons. The pros are that the visuals were stunning. Seriously, I have never seen New York like that before. Raining meteorites the size of a basketball, a 150mph flaming basketballs for that matter hits New York and destroys almost half of the city. Flaming cars go flying everywhere and the Empire State Building crumbles to the ground. hmmm. The destruction of Paris was a sight to behold. A very huge asteroid about the size of Vatican (this isn't the main asteroid, its still in space, this is like the one that got off earlier) hits right in the middle of Paris and *poof* one flick of the finger and Paris was blown to bits. You can see the famous Eiffel Tower collapse and be reduced to rubble. Some Asian country unfortunately got hit also by the meteorite shower. It hits all the places it can possibly hit. But, that's not it. Wait until you see their perilous journey through space. The effects were outstanding. I have to say, though I am not a scientist, the planets, asteroids, comets, meteors and all that Heavenly stuff were accurately visualized. Another pro is that they blended all the genres successfully. One scene gives you a taste of intense action, another gives you a tearful of drama and on the other hand you'll laugh at the witty comments and one-liners. It was blended well. The actors were very good too. Bruce Willis gives an excellent portrayal as the leader of the ragtag crew Harry Stamper. Billy Bob Thornton was great too. Though he is not in the frontlines, I can feel his character's feelings through his emotions. Other casts include Steve Buscemi as 'Rockhound', the genius of the team. Michael Clarke Duncan as 'Bear', the big, husking brute that's a force to reckon with. Owen Wilson's character (Oscar Choi, the Geologist) though died earlier than I expected gives off some witty one-liners that I can't forget. Ben Affleck, gives a good acting. Some parts of him in the movie were great, some were not. I dunno. I can't feel him in some of the scenes. But, that was SOME parts only. All in all great choice for a cast list.Sound score were top-notch. It gives you the mood that you are in space with them. The only con I noticed is a major plot loophole: Isn't it easier for NASA to train professional astronauts to drill than train expert core drillers to be astronauts? My 2 cents.Anyhoo, 7/10. Overall, job well done.",6,1,3,23 October 2006
21," McCheesy's take on '21'
","'m not really a fan of the game Blackjack or any of those card games (with the exception of poker) so I had some problems going into this film. Will I understand the film with all the Blackjack thing going on? Add to that the card counting and stuff? Well, it turns out it wasn't a problem after all. They somehow managed to explain the card counting bit but no worries because you can still understand the film even if you don't know Blackjack.Jim Sturgess, an up and coming young star, stars as MIT student Ben Campbell. He is persuaded by his teacher Micky Rosa (Spacey) to join a team of card-counting MIT misfits so he can pay off his Harvard Med plans. Kate Bosworth and Laurence Fishburne co-stars.The script, directing, acting, cinematography, editing, the casino scenes, the laugh-out-loud scenes, the Kevin Spacey scenes: its all good. Laurence Fishburne as an old-school Vegas thug was so badass, he will go down in the '2008's Badass in Films' list.",6,0,1,28 May 2008
Knowing," What happens when the numbers run out?
","After a not so hot streak of low end, trashy movies, Nicolas Cage has come back from the dead starring in this high powered apocalyptic horror/sci-fi breed from director Alex Proyas. I've always been a big fan of Cage, but not so much lately when he starred in what seemed to be a slew of uninspired movies that can be compared to garbage eaten by rats. But alas, guided by the right hands of a man with a vision and free reign, Cage returns to form and carries the whole movie all the way through. What's more is that he didn't need to don an ugly looking hairstyle, just a normal one and no killer bees, motorcycles on fire and Thai prostitutes either so my faith in him has been restored. I've heard news that he plans to retire soon, I say no.The man clearly has more to offer and to some, the stench of the havoc caused by Wicker Man, Ghost Rider and Bangkok Dangerous is still there. Maybe take another jab at the Oscar gold too. Nicolas Cage aside, I can't figure out what the movie really tries to be. There's part where it passes off as a horror movie and there are parts where the vibe is just pure science fiction. But I call a mix between the two because there's just enough to make it horrific and just the right amount to call it sci-fi. Alex Proyas, the man behind such great films like Dark City and The Crow may have made his best one yet with this movie. Peppered with great CG effects, just the right amount of dialogue for a movie like this and a couple of mind melting scenes that will cause your brain to leak out your ears. I saw it in a theater and I was on my toes the whole time probably because of the effective mood the director has toned it with and the astounding and ear shattering music score by Marco Beltrami.I wouldn't wanna spoil the ending but I can vouch for its uniqueness. Definitely not your typical Hollywood ending one expects it to be, I like how the director probably just slammed it all over the Roman Catholic church with the way the ending turned out and still, leaving a mark and a message that will make an impact to the audience and they won't even see it coming.One of the best films I've seen since 2009 kicked things off. It is just refreshing to see this one atop the box office and not some low rent, B-grade studio movie. Highly recommended.",7,2,9,25 March 2009
Wanted," McCheesy's take on 'Wanted'
","Wesley: This is not me... this is just a motherfacking decoy.This is definitely one of the most entertaining films to have come out this year. And by 'entertain', I mean mindless, campy, fun and reeks of awesomeness. 'Wanted' maybe filled with plot holes as big as Jupiter but at least they made it up in the area of visual style served with a side platter of sizzling action. There's a lot of cussing too. And they got Morgan Freeman to say the word 'Motherfacker', how cool is that? Initially, I would have given this a four but hearing Morgan Freeman cuss is just priceless.The car chase scenes would make Speed Racer proud, the bullets have minds of their own and lead actor James McAvoy masterfully disguises his British accent to embody the perfect American loser turned bad ass. This is what makes this film so damn irresistible. Top to that you have natural born fly guy Thomas Kretschmann in a very crucial role to the film plus Angelina Jolie in her bad ass form. Seriously, she was born to be a bad ass in films. That's why I loved Mr. and Mrs. Smith, she has this natural spunk in her which makes her cool without even trying. I think its the look and those lips.Now I know a lot of people dissed the film because its a) a rip-off, b) the story doesn't make sense and c) it is pretty stupid. That's probably because you didn't leave your pseudo-intellectual mindset right at the doorstep. Films like these, you don't have to take seriously. And I quote The Joker on this one: 'Why so serious?' Take it for what it is: a very entertaining film and I think you'll be alright. Now, don't just facking sit there reading this bull and I highly facking suggest you facking go see this one. Like, right facking now.",7,2,6,23 July 2008
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," The penguins need their own movie
","I was never really a fan of the first movie, I thought it was a good premise but was poorly put together and the situations they found themselves in the first movie is just way out there. The Penguin quartet stole that show for me and was the only humorous thing that kept the movie from falling apart. I just saw this sequel just for the heck of it and in my opinion, this is a step above from its predecessor but however, not that big of a deal to me. I saw it, I laughed three or four times and maybe tomorrow I'll forget it. Its the same old schtick you saw in the first one, even that annoying old lady returns and your favorite castaways still find themselves in hilarious situations that are way out there.It was a good thing that they added more characters but it almost felt like they were just there for decoration. Maybe throw in a couple of hilarious quips and do something that a normal animal won't do and that's that. And like in the first movie, the Penguins still stole everyone's thunder and still kept the movie from falling apart. Forget the part where a shark hops and skips across the barren wildlife of Africa and the idea of an old lady going Rocky on an adult lion, I just wanted to see these penguins cause trouble but now in a different location. They deserve a spin-off, stat.",5,25,55,1 December 2008
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," McCheesy's take on 'Walk Hard: A Dewey Cox Story'
","I was kinda skeptical in seeing this one mainly because of the damage Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg had done to the parody movie genre. 'Epic Movie' who was supposed to spoof 'epic' movies like Narnia and Pirates of the Caribbean was a total mess. I didn't laugh one bit. Don't even start with 'Date Movie', its the most un-funniest thing you'll ever see in your TV screen. And the other film was just plain crap. I'm starting to think Uwe Boll is a better director than these two bloodsucking bottom feeders.So anyway, this one was co-written by Judd Apatow, one of Hollywood's awesomest directors, and the actors are mostly from the Apatow gang so I decided to give it a try.While it is not the greatest of Apatow's films, it sure succeeds in parodying 'Walk the Line' and it is hilarious as hell. The script, though sometimes a bit absurd and just plain crazy, was very well written. Its what you get from the world's greatest director in the comedy circuit.John C. Reilly portrayed music legend Dewey Cox like Will Ferrell would have portrayed it. The dialogues uttered by Dewey Cox were so Will Ferrell-ish. I am starting to think Will Ferrell would have been a better Dewey Cox. Don't get me wrong, John C. Reilly was awesome but Will Ferrell, I think was a better choice.The funniest scene would probably be the Beatles cameo in India. Jack Black is awfully funny as Paul McCartney, Paul Rudd was spot-on as John Lennon, Jason Schwartzman was hilarious as Ringo Starr and Justin Long was pitch perfect as George Harrison.Watch it. It is a decent parody movie. 8/10",7,0,1,16 April 2008
Disturbia," Only in....
","Disturbia disturbed me...a lot. The plot is just simply great. A teenage guy played by rising Hollywood star Shia LaBeouf is under house arrest and out of boredom, spies on his neighbors through his binoculars and video camera. What he didn't expect is that his next-door neighbor Mr. Turner, played by David Morse, is actually a serial killer on the loose. After witnessing a murder, he goes all out to bring down Mr. Turner. But teenage aggression can only go so far.Superb acting by Shia. Although, I have only seen him once before Disturbia, The Greatest Game Ever Played, he has improved a lot. I can't wait to see him in Indy 4. Support cast was great too, Carrie-Ann Moss, David Morse and that funny Chinese guy. I swear I almost wet my pants when Kale saw Ronnie dead inside his closet and I was like, oh my god, how did Mr. Turner get inside his house? And then we find out that he was just playing possum. That f**. The ending sequence left me breathless, with Shia trying to be an Alpha Male carrying his bat and storming Mr. Turner's house. Damn, that's what you call bravery.A 8/10 for an awesome thriller.",7,1,3,8 November 2008
American History X," American History X
","'His father taught him to hate. His friends taught him rage. His enemies gave him hope.' Tony Kaye made his feature directorial debut with this dramatic exploration into the roots of race hatred in America. In a shocking opening scene, teen Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) races to tell his older brother, neo-Nazi Derek (Edward Norton), about the young blacks breaking into his car in front of the house, whereupon Derek gets his gun and with no forethought shoots the youths in their tracks. Tried and convicted, Derek is sent away for three years in prison, where he acquires a different outlook as he contrasts white-power prisoners with black Lamont (Guy Torry), his prison laundry co-worker and eventual pal. Meanwhile, Danny, with a shaved head and a rebellious attitude, seems destined to follow in his big brother's footsteps. After Danny writes a favorable review of Hitler's Mein Kampf, black high-school principal Sweeney (Avery Brooks) puts Danny in his private 'American History X' course and assigns him to do a paper about his older brother, who was a former student of Sweeney's. This serves to introduce flashbacks, with the film backtracking to illustrate Danny's account of Derek's life prior to the night of the shooting. Monochrome sequences of Derek leading a Venice, California gang are intercut with color footage of the mature Derek ending his past neo-Nazi associations and attempting to detour Danny away from the group led by white supremacist, Cameron (Stacy Keach), who once influenced Derek. Director Tony Kaye, with a background in TV commercials and music videos, filmed in L.A. beach communities. Rated R 'for graphic brutal violence including rape, pervasive language, strong sexuality and nudity.'American History X is a powerful statement to modern society. Racism have always been a sensitive subject to tackle and not since Schindler's List have we seen this powerful of a film be presented with such potency. Edward Norton shines in his role as Neo-Nazi white supremacist skin-head Derek Vinyard. He was able to adapt to his character both physically and emotionally. Playing as his brother Danny, Edward Furlong sizes up to Norton's intensity and was able to spar acting wits with him.The touch of black & white was a nice addition as well. Director Tony Kaye gave the film a grim look and his eye for visual style was impressive as well. The ending is cringe-worthy. Believe me, you will not laugh or smirk as the film reaches its tragic conclusion.American History X is a must-see. You will not be disappointed.",9,0,1,30 October 2008
Tropic Thunder," Tropic Thunder
","'Get Some' Ben Stiller's satirical look at Hollywood, Tropic Thunder concerns the production of an epic Vietnam War film that quickly derails thanks to the giant egos of everyone involved in the production. Stiller stars as Tugg Speedman, an action hero trying to segue out of that genre. Jack Black plays Jeff Portnoy, a drug-addicted fat comic also attempting to change his image by taking on such a serious film. They star alongside Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.), one of the world's most awarded actors, and a man who insists on immersing himself totally in a role. In this case, that means Lazarus has had his skin dyed in order to portray an African-American soldier. After their outrageous behavior lands the film's director, Damien (Steve Coogan), in very hot water with producer Les Grossman (Tom Cruise), Damien takes the advice of grizzled Vietnam vet Four Leaf Tayback (Nick Nolte); in order to gain control of his performers, Damien drops the actors off in the jungle, planning to film the movie guerrilla-style with hidden cameras. When the group stumbles upon a heroin production camp, the actors are unaware that they are in very real danger.One of 2008's funniest movies and a hilarious yet, almost true parody of the way Hollywood works. One of the best parodies I've seen in a long time well for one thing, the parody/spoof genre has been infested by the street trash that is Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer and their puke-inducing movies so I'm really glad that someone stepped in to save the already dying genre. And not only somebody but funny man Ben Stiller who's been making us laugh since he accidentally zipped his Wang between his zipper.Ben Stiller stars and also directs this movie along with Robert Downey Jr. and Jack Black to take on a movie in a movie they're starring in. In this case, a war movie but not really a war movie when it all becomes real so the 'movie' factor is taken out and the results are hilariously catastrophic. There are two things that stole the show, first is Robert Downey Jr, playing Kirk Lazarus playing a black platoon Sargent in the fake movie. Every word he says is golden, I couldn't control myself from laughing out loud. I mean, he doesn't even have to do anything, all he needed to do was stand there and at least try to act like a black guy and the hilarity will ensue.Second is Tom Cruise in a fat suit as mogul producer Les Grossman. His potty mouth plus the fat suit and top to that a hilariously awkward dance routine to the beat of a rap music. You couldn't get any better than that. The others of course were not left out of the spotlight, Jack Black is in his usual form, an obnoxious yet lovable funny man and Ben Stiller also in his usual form as an ignorant schnozzle.Solid deliveries, a hilarious script and hysterical scenarios are what makes this film a comedic gem. If you want to have a good laugh, this movie is highly recommended.",8,0,1,12 October 2008
Quantum of Solace," Quantum of Suckers
","Quantum of Solace aims but misses, it shoots but it doesn't score. Its Bonnie without Clyde and its one of the disappointing movies to have come out this year. It really was a shock because everything seemed so right before its release. It had a credible director, Marc Forster who directed some of the finest films in recent memory, the plot seemed so right, its a revenge tale; its a look at Bond's ugly side and his inner demons and they cast a perfect actor as the villain. Mathieu Amalric was outstanding in 'Diving Bell and the Butterfly' and I couldn't wait to see how he fares well as a Bond villain.Well, it turns out Dominic Greene is just as uninteresting as a plank of wood. Gemma Arterton's character Agent Fields was just there for eye-candy and we could have just got on with the story line without her. The tragic conclusion that happened to her was totally unnecessary and honestly, it was a waste of running time. Given that this is a Bond movie, we should expect flashy gadgets, a treasure trove of hot Bond babes and signature trade marks that we all got used to in the first 21 films.Sadly, they're all not here. The things that we liked about this franchise was just gone with the wind. No gadgets, no classic one-liners like the Martini one and the gun in a barrel intro was left out until the end credits. Granted there is a dazzling Bond girl here in the form of Ukrainian born actress Olga Kurylenko but Bond didn't even get the chance to use his charm and sex appeal to have mighty sex with her. Besides, what's a Bond girl got to do other than have sex with the Man, right? The action scenes was turned up a notch but it gets in the way of the storyline and you end up with a noisy film going nowhere. But nevertheless, the choreography was impressive and is a step above to the action scenes of its predecessor Casino Royale. There is not much to say about acting other than Daniel Craig is the epitome of what Ian Fleming had in mind. Dame Judi Dench gives her supporting powers and the two of them are the compass of a lost movie that was going nowhere. Director Marc Forster mishandled the camera especially in some of the action scenes and it is rather obvious that his priority went to the guns-blazing, barrel exploding action rather than the storyline itself. The audience was glad when Casino Royale rejuvenated the dying franchise but the gladness only lasted two years when Forster flushed it all in the toilet with this disappointing mess. He should never direct an action movie again.",6,3,5,7 November 2008
Mamma Mia!," Mamma Mia!
","'Take a trip down the aisle you'll never forget' Longing to discover the identity of her true father before she exchanges her wedding vows, the daughter of a once-rebellious single mother secretly invites a trio of paternal candidates to her upcoming wedding in this feature adaptation of the beloved stage musical. Independent-minded single mother Donna (Meryl Streep) has always done her best to raise her spirited daughter, Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), while simultaneously running a successful hotel on a small Greek island, but now the time has come for this hardworking mom to finally let go. In just a few days, Sophie will be married, and Donna will stand by bittersweetly as her little girl takes flight. Of course, Donna's lifelong friends Rosie (Julie Walters) and Tanya (Christine Baranski) will both be present at the wedding, but unbeknownst to the mother, Sophie has furtively invited three very special guests of her own. When Sophie walks down the aisle on that fateful day, she wants her father to hand her off. The only problem is that Donna has never revealed the true identity of Sophie's father, leaving the resourceful future bride to narrow the list down to three potential candidates. Now, as three key figures from Donna's past return to the picturesque Mediterranean shores they all walked 20 years prior, one beautiful bride will discover the secret of her past while one lonely mother finds out that it's never too late for a little romance. Phyllida Lloyd, director of both the original London sensation as well as the hit Broadway incarnation, makes her feature directorial debut with this big-screen version of the beloved musical featuring 22 classic ABBA hits. Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgård, and Dominic Cooper co-star. Review The gayest movie to have come out this year (and by gay I mean jolly), Mamma Mia! surprisingly, shocked me. 'Shock' might be the right term because first off, I'm not really a fan of ABBA and second, musicals isn't really my cup of tea; but every once in a while, I'm head over heels when a good musical comes my way (Across the Universe and Sweeney Todd comes to mind). Mamma Mia! told a story: a story of a young woman searching for his real dad in scenic Greece the day before her wedding and they used the music of ABBA as the narrative device. The music is hip, its funky, its catchy and some adults out there might just feel nostalgic listening to the songs they grew up with when they were young. I'm gonna use the word 'shock' once again as Pierce Brosnan, the man we know and love as Agent 007 belts it out to the tune of the gayest song ever (and by gay I mean jolly). The guy sang, and he sang his heart out. A pretty impressive turn from hard edged spy thrillers to a dancing and singing gay movie. Meryl Streep, also quite the charmer, sang her heart out as well. Newcomer Amanda Seyfried, last time I saw her she was cupping her boobs to predict the weather in Mean Girls also took a mighty impressive turn as the poster girl for the promotion of the movie and quite honestly, she held out on her own. She definitely has the acting (and singing) chops. I'm gonna see more of her in the future. In its entirety, Mamma Mia! is quite an enjoyable musical ride from start to finish. You wouldn't want to miss it.",7,1,1,27 October 2008
The Pianist," The Pianist
","'Music was his passion. Survival was his masterpiece.'Filmmaker Roman Polanski, who as a boy growing up in Poland watched while the Nazis devastated his country during World War II, directed this downbeat drama based on the true story of a privileged musician who spent five years struggling against the Nazi occupation of Warsaw. Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) is a gifted classical pianist born to a wealthy Jewish family in Poland. The Szpilmans have a large and comfortable flat in Warsaw which Wladyslaw shares with his mother and father (Maureen Lipman and Frank Finlay), his sisters Halina and Regina (Jessica Kate Meyer and Julia Rayner), and his brother, Henryk (Ed Stoppard). While Wladyslaw and his family are aware of the looming presence of German forces and Hitler's designs on Poland, they're convinced that the Nazis are a menace which will pass, and that England and France will step forward to aid Poland in the event of a real crisis. Wladyslaw's naïveté is shattered when a German bomb rips through a radio studio while he performs a recital for broadcast. During the early stages of the Nazi occupation, as a respected artist, he still imagines himself above the danger, using his pull to obtain employment papers for his father and landing a supposedly safe job playing piano in a restaurant. But as the German grip tightens upon Poland, Wladyslaw and his family are selected for deportation to a Nazi concentration camp. Refusing to face a certain death, Wladyslaw goes into hiding in a comfortable apartment provided by a friend. However, when his benefactor goes missing, Wladyslaw is left to fend for himself and he spends the next several years dashing from one abandoned home to another, desperate to avoid capture by German occupation troops. The Pianist was based on the memoir of the same name by the real-life Wladyslaw Szpilman; the book was first published in 1946 as Death of a City, but was banned by Polish Communist officials and went out of print until 1998, when a new edition was issued as The Pianist. Review The Pianist is a stunning masterpiece directed by Roman Polanski and starring Adrien Brody in quite possibly the best role he's ever done. He basically carried the film whole throughout and I'm glad to say he carried it real good. Some scenes required no dialogue, only the body movement and the raw emotion of Adrien Brody, it was just a spectacle. I can see why he won the Oscars, he really deserved it. He gave his all in this masterpiece of a film and he reaped the golden fruits of his labor. Roman Polanski on the other hand, excellently handled the camera, he showed exactly what needs to be shown, no BS. The film tackles very sensitive topics and Polanski didn't even flinch, he wants us to see the grimness of those dark days. Example, there's this one scene where this lady asked an SS Officer where they're taking them and the SS Officer without remorse, shot the lady point blank in the head. Just so dark and grim and he wanted us to see it all.A tip of the hat to the cast and crew of The Pianist for making such a masterpiece. This is a fine film that you wouldn't want to miss.",9,0,0,20 October 2008
Bolt," A truly memorable affair
","The animated movie scene is on a roll this year. It started with Dreamworks' Kung Fu Panda, then with the joyous Pixar gem Wall-E and now, with Walt Disney's heartfelt treat, Bolt. This movie is just fun from the minute it starts until it ends and they didn't forget to put in some heart which then makes some lasting impression to the audience. You will laugh at Rhino the hamster's overeager attitude and snappy dialogues, Mittens the cat and the pigeons were great comic relief but the star of the show Bolt, is the one who truly shines. He's just too darn cute in his Truman Show world, they gave him a distinct memorable character and John Travolta's voice work gave it life. Bolt's person, Penny who is voiced by tween popstar Miley Cyrus fit the character well. Seeing as this is her first time doing a gig like this, I can say she got the job done and very professional, I might add. As long as she's doing voice over gigs and gets second billing, that's fine by me.Ultimately, I think what made this movie really work is John Lasseter. The Pixar brainchild who transferred to Disney. He gave Bolt a touch of Pixar that we all know and love but still separates it from other animated movies and giving it a distinct trait that we all knew and love in Disney classics like Snow White and Cinderella. All in all, Bolt is one of 2008's must-see movies, trust me, you wouldn't want to miss it for the world.",8,4,8,17 December 2008
The Lives of Others," The Lives of Others
","'Before the Fall of the Berlin Wall, East Germany's Secret Police Listened to Your Secrets' A man who has devoted his life to ferreting out 'dangerous' characters is thrown into a quandary when he investigates a man who poses no threat in this drama, the first feature from German filmmaker Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. It's 1984, and Capt. Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe) is an agent of the Stasi, the East German Secret Police. Weisler carefully and dispassionately investigates people who might be deemed some sort of threat to the state. Shortly after Weisler's former classmate, Lt. Col. Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur), invites him to a theatrical piece by celebrated East German playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), Minister Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme) informs Weisler that he suspects Dreyman of political dissidence, and wonders if this renowned patriot is all that he seems to be. As it turns out, Hempf has something of an ulterior motive for trying to pin something on Dreyman: a deep-seated infatuation with Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), Dreyman's girlfriend. Nevertheless, Grubitz, who is anxious to further his career, appoints Weisler to spy on the gentleman with his help. Weisler plants listening devices in Dreyman's apartment and begins shadowing the writer. As Weisler monitors Dreyman's daily life, however (from a secret surveillance station in the gentleman's attic), he discovers the writer is one of the few East Germans who genuinely believes in his leaders. This changes over time, however, as Dreyman discovers that Christa-Maria is being blackmailed into a sexual relationship with Hempf, and one of Dreyman's friends, stage director Albert Jerska (Volkmar Kleinert), is driven to suicide after himself being blackballed by the government. Dreyman's loyalty thus shifts away from the East German government, and he anonymously posts an anti-establishment piece in a major newspaper which rouses the fury of government officials. Meanwhile, Weisler becomes deeply emotionally drawn into the lives of Dreyman and Sieland, and becomes something of an anti-establishment figure himself, embracing freedom of thought and expression. A major box-office success in Germany, Das Leben der Anderen (aka The Lives of Others) received its North American premiere at the 2006 Toronto Film Festival.The Lives of Others can only be described in one word: Hervorragende , which is 'outstanding' in German, I think. Set five years before the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Stasi (or Secret Police) listened to all your secrets, no one is spared. But when a Stasi officer is put to the test, he must decide if whether he must put his job on the line to do what really is right or be lost in the corruption in a poisoned society forever.The authenticity of the film was top notch which I found very satisfying and top to that a very engaging script and a grim mood & atmosphere. The impressive acting sealed the deal for me with stellar performances from veteran German actors Ulrich Mühe, Martina Gedeck and Sebastian Koch. Ulrich Mühe, who looks a lot like Kevin Spacey, captivates the audience with his ice steel character and commanding presence. If you're into films from around the world and such, then this is a must-see.",9,0,0,1 November 2008
The Hurt Locker," War is a drug
","Action woman Kathryn Bigelow returns to form in this intense war drama about an elite Bomb Squad whose job is to disarm and diffuse deadly bombs that plagues modern day Iraq. Her first film since 2002's K19:The Widowmaker, this movie is the best way to make a comeback and I just hope people will notice that. Rarely does a woman captivate the action junkies out there by putting together a series of intense, breath taking scenes and with the lightning fast pace she simply won't let you recover and you'll find yourself glued to the screen for the whole two hours of the movie.Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty all gave good performances though not memorable in any way, they carry the sentiments of the soldiers currently serving in the Iraq war and I believe justice is brought to each of their roles. Supporting roles include Ralph Fiennes, who is everywhere right now, Guy Pearce and David Morse. Although much of them are pretty much in only a scene or two, they did pretty well considering. The Hurt Locker is a movie that transcends politics and all that mumbo jumbo. Simply put, this movie is a kickass action pic that grabs you by the throat and won't let go until the end credits roll. If you're into this kind of stuff, then this is a must see.",8,91,182,27 January 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," The Curious Case of an Amazing Film
","Words cannot express how truly magnificent this film is. This is what film-making is all about, pure escapism. You forget reality for two hours and you'll get an amazing masterwork helmed by a genius, written by a visionary and defined by high standard acting. Everything is so right in this film, from the acting, to the vivid cinematography. The directing and writing were beyond excellent. Some people complained about its length and I am not one of them. Believe it or not, I actually wanted more out of it, it is that good but I believe the ending is just as magical the way it is. David Fincher, one of the greatest directors in our current generation takes another risky project and turns it into one of the most beautiful films of recent memory. From Fight Club to Seven and 2007's sleeper Zodiac, the guy has yet to make a bad film. Well, except for Alien 3 but that is nothing but history now. Kudos also to the guys who wrote 'Button', the geniuses Eric Roth and Robin Swicord, their work is simply masterful I wouldn't omit a line from the film. Every second is treasured and wasn't wasted.Brad Pitt has come a long way since Thelma & Louise. The dashing debonair didn't resort to his boyish good looks but instead acts wonderfully. There is a certain charm about him that makes Benjamin an interesting and memorable character. He puts his all and the payoff is grand. Cate Blanchett is just superb as Daisy. No other actress could have portrayed Daisy like Cate did and the chemistry between them is just magic. Taraji P. Henson deserves at least a Best Supporting nod, what she did to Queenie couldn't have been better. Its just amazing. The make-up department deserves a round of applause too, the effects that renders Pitt into an old, frail child were just a thing of beauty. All in all, 'Benjamin Button' is a 2008 masterwork that you can't afford to miss. Highly recommended.",8,0,4,14 January 2009
Mulholland Drive," McCheesy's take on 'Mulholland Dr.'
","What the hell is up with this film? I knew this film is going to be strange because of all the reviews it got but man, that was way too bizarre. Was the director on crack when he made this film? I'm still mystified by it up until now. This is definitely one of those films that requires second viewing and some internet consultations.OK. So the first part of the film can be easily followed. Its basically about a woman who had amnesia and this woman Betty takes her in in her aunt's apartment and then inside the purse of the woman with amnesia there's loads of money. Puzzled, Betty and Rita (the woman) decides to follow some leads and track down her real identity. There's some subplots involved concerning a Hollywood director (Justin Theroux) struggling to find a lead actress in his new film and then there's this hit-man who is I think looking for the money and then there's a guy who died because he saw a bum in a dumpster (a lol moment) which is totally unrelated to the story.But then, when the moment Rita drops the blue box it all goes to crazy town and I was like this little kid confused and clueless and all alone. Right up until the last frame, you will be confused. I don't think any person could understand it first viewing.David Lynch, who is known for making really weird movies, captures what it is like inside a dream. This is what the movie is in a nutshell: a dream. Its so bizarre and haywire. But if you watch it closely and observe, I mean really observe it all makes sense. I just viewed it for the second time just now and I completely understood it now. And from what I've seen , its beautiful. Its like a jigsaw puzzle, before you see the complete picture you must first piece all the puzzle and the reward is very glorious. The acting is just superb. Naomi Watts is a complete stand out. She really stood among the rest. The others were pretty good too. The directing is just plain excellent. David Lynch among other 'weird' directors like Gondry, will go down as one of my favorite directors ever.Mulholland Dr. is excellent overall. Therefore it gets an 8.",8,0,1,30 May 2008
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Why are you wearing a pyjama?
","Another 'Oscar-bait Holocaust' movie? I don't think so. Its not even nominated in the Oscars so now its a 'Holocaust movie' but alas, its more than a Holocaust movie. As seen through the eyes of Bruno, an eight year old child who forms a forbidden friendship with a Jewish little Boy, Shmuel. The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is an especially moving film coupled with a heartbreaking ending and some great performances from the whole cast. Child actors Asa Butterfield (Bruno) and Jack Scanlon (Shmuel) both give stellar performances and the adults doesn't fail either. Vera Farmiga gave a dead on performance as Bruno's mother while David Thewlis took one for the home team as the Herr Komandant of Auschwitz and Bruno's father. Rupert Friend also gives a notable performance as Thewlis's right hand man Lieutenant Kotler.But what really struck me the most in the movie is the ending. They stepped out the usual Hollywood norm where everybody everywhere is happy and giddy. I'm not gonna spoil the ending for you so I'll only tell you this, you surely won't be smiling once the film reaches its tragic conclusion. In fact its the exact opposite, you will cry buckets.",9,4,7,15 February 2009

This sequel to the first smash hit Saw is about a group of people held captive inside a house full of traps especially made for them by Jigsaw. While Jigsaw is being held by the police, Det Eric Matthews tries to squeeze out information from Jigsaw as to where the house might be. It turns out that the house is filled with lethal nerve gas that kills the people inside (unfortunately, Det Eric Matthews' son, Daniel is also inside) within two hours. A door will open after three hours so that means that they can't live that long when the door opens. So, Jigsaw has scattered antidotes all over the house so they can live and escape the house. With the clock ticking, Det Eric Matthews must save his son and the people inside before its too late.Great twisted plot and a twisted ending makes this film stand out from the rest. Great acting by Tobin Bell as Jigsaw and Donnie Wahlberg. This films keeps you hanging in a balance and it keeps you guessing till the end. Also, Adam's carcass gives a special participation and so is Zep's rotting body and Dr. Gordon's foot. And yes, the infamous bathroom from Saw will be featured in Saw II. 8/10",6,0,1,5 November 2006
The Dark Knight," McCheesy's take on 'The Dark Knight'
","Wow. Just wow. And I thought Batman Begins is the epitome of comic book movies. The Dark Knight isn't just the best comic book film ever, its one of the best films to have come out in recent memory. Everything in it is amazingly done and in tip-top shape. From the out-of-this-world acting to the heart pounding musical score courtesy of elite scorers James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer. Every little bit worked in the film's advantage and not one bit seemed annoying or dragged. The story is near damn poetic especially the end parts where Batman had to make a big decision for the betterment of Gotham city. To avoid spoiling the film, I will only say this: the ending is epic. Though there were a couple of questions left unanswered like what will happen to Harvey Dent and since Heath's untimely death, what will become of The Joker in the 3rd installment? Speaking of the late great Heath Ledger, his portrayal of The Joker is beyond words. It was much hyped even before its release and some were highly speculating that he might get a posthumous Oscar for this one. Well, along with the millions of people on this side of Earth, I think he really, really deserves it. The Oscars must be high up their asses if they pass up this one. If an Oscar won't work because of the film's mainstream status, at least have the heart to recognize it. Heath Ledger went away with a bang and he deserves all the praise he gets. It was a darker, mature and grittier version than Nicholson's comical performance in the Tim Burton film. Granted, Nicholson's performance was stellar that is until Heath Ledger came into the picture. Ledger's Joker makes Nicholson's look like a mascot for a Disney ride. His Joker is a walking hell on Earth and his devilish philosophies and ideas will make you cower in absolute fear. I'm so glad Nolan left out the origin idea for The Joker because if they did, the mystery and creepy factor of the character will turn down a notch. It won't be as 'absolute' as planned. Every scene with Ledger's Joker is hellacious and watching it on IMAX is a thousand times more hellacious. His Joker is near perfection his portrayal easily catapults the character as one of the best movie villains of all time. He takes the top spot alongside Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter, Star Wars' Darth Vader and Spacey's John Doe. And to tell you the truth, if I think of The Dark Knight, one enduring image is imprinted on my mind: The Joker with his head sticking out a police car with no audible sound in the background. That's it right there, I knew I had to give this film a 5. The theater went silent for a while because that scene was just too much to handle. Ledger's maniacal portrayal combined with Nolan's masterful skills, its a match made in heaven.Of course its not all Joker with this film. The titular hero portrayed by Hollywood thespian Christian Bale, need I say more? He's the guy you can trust to amazingly portray dark and gritty characters. And yes I think he's the best Batman, no doubt Keaton's was excellent and Kilmer's was just 'eh?' and don't start with Clooney, I'm still not over with those Bat Nipples. But Christian Bale is the embodiment of Bruce Wayne. Just as much as Heath Ledger is The Joker, the same thing applies with Christian Bale. He is Batman, he is Bruce Wayne.And then there's Aaron Eckhart. He superbly portrays District Attorney Harvey Dent and fiendishly embodies his menacing alter-ego Two-Face. This is the first time I've seen Eckhart do a serious dramatic role, his previous films were either cheeky love stories or cheeky comedy flicks or a combination of both. Not that I'm getting tired of him seeing in those films but every actor needs to tread uncharted territory to prove their versatility and I think Mr. Eckhart just did that here. His Two-Face makes Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal in Schumacher's appalling rendition a big hunk of fecal matter. And man, for a PG-13 of a film, Two-Face's ugly side is gory-licious to the umpteenth dimension.The remaining actors should be proud too. Maggie Gyllenhaal, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, they were all amazing. A wise move for Nolan to replace horrendous Katie Holmes for Maggie 'Sherrybaby' Gyllenhaal. Her character's fate in the film saddens me but you see...it's all...part of the plan.The Dark Knight is the best film of 2008. There is no 'so-far', there is no 'to date'. This is the best film of 2008 hands down no questions asked bar none. You're missing out a lot if you still haven't seen this one. I suggest you go now. Like, now.9/10.",9,2,6,20 July 2008
The Graduate," Mrs. Robinson you're trying to seduce me, aren't you?
","The Graduate is a true timeless classic that struck all the right chords. Benjamin Braddock is character that I can totally relate to and pretty much all the teens who had the same exact problems after graduating college. Dustin Hoffman's breakout role as Ben is a dead on impression. He gives a wonderfully underplayed performance, he got the awkwardness bit right down to that uneasy smirk and the deep lifeless stare. Anne Bancroft on the other hand, plays the legendary major cougar Mrs. Robinson. I have heard a lot of things about the character and my expectations for the infamous cougar queen were really high and after watching the film, my expectations were more than met. She plays the role like she knows it by heart and steals almost every scene she's in. Screw that TV show, Mrs. Robinson is the real desperate housewife.Another great aspect of the film is the soundtrack. Never have I seen a song used more appropriately in a film and The Graduate's 'A Sound of Silence' represents the problem and turmoils the characters face in the film. This is Mike Nichols' best film and easily one of my favorite movies of all-time. If you still haven't seen this, by all means watch it at any cost. Highly recommended.",10,6,9,12 February 2009
Taken," Taken
","'They took his daughter. He'll take their lives.' Taken delivers all the chills and the thrills with a perfect sense of pacing, the right amount of action and a lot of necks breaking. Bad ass impresario Liam Neeson is taking names as a retired spy who is forced back into action when his daughter is kidnapped by slave traders while on a leisure vacation in Paris. He basically just kills everyone he sees that isn't her daughter and hell hath no fury like a roaring rampage of revenge. The sleek action scenes were just downright gritty. There's no wires involved, no gratuitous back flips or slow-mo flying kicks. Its all bare knuckles, street fighting brawl. Great choreography I must say and as it may slightly resemble the Bourne movies, Taken stands on its own feet as a high octane action thriller.Frenchman extraordinaire Luc Besson co-wrote the screenplay and his right hand man Pierre Morel directs. All in all, Taken is a must-see for all you action junkies out there.",9,1,3,2 November 2008
The Mummy Returns," McCheesy's take on 'The Mummy Returns'
","Yet another solid Mummy film. It was rather fun watching this one but it lacks some key elements. They had to use the same villain again who died in the first film, it was bad. He died already, no need to recycle villains. The concept was rather enjoyable and they managed to put a mean looking villain in the embodiment of Mathayus, half man half scorpion.The whole reincarnate angle was unnecessary. The film would have worked a lot better if they left that bit in the cutting room. It is obviously just an excuse so the two smokin' ladies can battle it out with their sais in the end of the film.On a positive note, I can probably say it is a lot better than the first one. The first Mummy is one action scene short than its sequel. This one was bigger than the first in many ways. Here's hoping for a yet more bigger Mummy 3 (Though I don't really dig the fact that there's no more deserts in the third film, its the Mummy. Mummies reside in the vast deserts, not China)",6,0,0,3 May 2008
Saw," Game over...
","Directed by first timer James Wan and assisted by Leigh Whannell, this film is about two men who lies chained into the ankles in a filthy bathroom and a dead man between them. Adam (Leigh Whannell) receives a message from a tape recorder he found in his pocket. It says that he may die in the room he is in unless he does something about it. Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) also receives a message from a videotape and tells him that he must kill Adam within six hours or his family will die. He then receives a bullet and an unknown key. We are then indulged into numerous flashbacks that reveals why they got there and who is their captor. Their captor, is then revealed to be a serial killer named 'Jigsaw' portrayed by Tobin Bell who uses sick games to murder his victims yet he claims that he hasn't killed anyone. Its up to his victims whether they die or not.The movie is outstanding in many ways. The concept was just darn good. Its not your average slasher, run-here-scream-there film, it has more sense and they put more meaning to it. The cast, though its the first time that I've seen them, were great too. Adam's agonizing scream at the end has had me sleepless nights and bad dreams. And its also the first time that I felt sympathy to the villain. He don't kill people for nothing. He has a reason. Its not just some big guy who slashes people just because they trespassed his territory or something. Jigsaw kills people who don't appreciate life, the ones who don't deserve it. A 9/10 for a smart horror flick.",8,0,1,2 November 2006
The Fly," The Fly
","'Something went wrong in the lab today. Very wrong.'Seth Brundle is a research scientist, employed by Bartok Sciences, who has invented 'Telepods' two matter transmission pods that teleports any object through space from one 'Telepod' to the other 'Telepod'. But, it is until Seth meets journalist Veronica Quaife who inspires Seth to correct the system, that Seth achieves successful teleportation. But something goes horribly wrong, when Seth uses himself as a guinea-pig in a matter transmission experiment, as he teleports himself, unaware his genes have been fused with a house fly that was trapped in the telepod with him. Seth, now finds himself slowly transforming into a terrifying mutant creature known as 'Brundlefly' as he finds himself in a fierce battle as his mutated genes begins to take over.This 1958 horror remake directed by David Cronenberg was a great watch, it had all the elements for an epic horror film. First the amazing yet nasty and puke inducing special effects. For a 1986 film, I'd say it was way ahead of its time when it came to make-up effects, I almost puked on my popcorn every time Brundlefly is doing nasty things in his apartment. Second, the character development of Jeff Goldblum's character Seth Brundle and Geena Davis' Veronica. Come to think of it, if you remove the horror factor of the film, you'd get a romantic story between an eccentric scientist and a promising journalist. The first half of the film basically focuses on said love affair and the second half is where the horrific element sets in and I gotta be honest, it really pays off.Jeff Goldblum in his best role ever, is stunning. He delivers great dialogue and even when he's covered in horrific make-up, you can still see the humanity inside of the character, all thanks to the brilliant performance of Goldblum. The Fly is more than a horror film, it was a statement back when it was released and its still a statement up until now. It truly is amazing how you can find cinematic gems like these where you least expect it.",8,0,1,6 October 2008
Invincible," McCheesy's take on 'Invincible'
","A pretty solid inspirational sports flick with Mark Wahlberg in the lead. He plays Philly's local hero Vince Papale who started out as a bartender and made his way through NFL. A true underdog story based on a true story. If it comes to sports in films, you'll never go wrong with football. From 'Remember the Titans' to 'Gridiron Gang' and even 'The Longest Yard', its the most enjoyable to watch even if you don't have a first hand clue about the rules and such. Like me, I just love those quarterbacks tackling each other like hell.If you want a feel good movie with some added football in the mix, then I suggest you go see this one.",7,0,0,3 July 2008
Reservoir Dogs," Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs
","First scene. We see a bunch of guys in tuxedos eating and talking in a restaurant. They talk about random stuff like how the song 'Like a Virgin' by Madonna is all about big dicks and some guy explains why he don't tip to waitresses. Then, we hear K-Billy's voice and we see these dudes walking down in slow-motion. We now know who they are. Harvey Keitel as 'Mr. White', Tim Roth as 'Mr. Orange, Michael Madsen as 'Mr. Blonde', the late Chris Penn as 'Nice Guy Eddie', the late Lawrence Tierney as 'Joe Cabot', Steve Buscemi as 'Mr. Pink', the also late Eddie Bunker as 'Mr. Blue' and the director himself, Quentin Tarantino as 'Mr. Brown'.Cut to next scene, we see a bloodied Mr. Orange in a backseat of a car while Mr. White is driving. They then went to the rendezvous point as, what they say, planned. The rendezvous point is actually an abandoned warehouse. Upon reaching the place, Mr. White tries to calm an almost dying Mr. Orange who's shot in the belly by an unknown reason. Then, enters a hysterical Mr. Pink who tells Mr. White that the heist went awfully wrong because he thinks someone in their group is a rat. The both of them pin points every possible people they know that might be the rat. Then comes Mr. Blonde who abducted a cop to squeeze out information on who might the rat be. One flashback leads to another and we see the whole truth. Mr. Orange is the rat and ensnares the other into the heist. Mr. Brown dies, Mr. Blue is dead as Dillinger, Mr. Blonde was shot by Mr. Orange, Mr. White, Joe Cabot and Nice Guy Eddie are caught in a Mexican Stand-off and leads to their eventual demise. The only surviving human is Mr. Pink who takes the jewel but was later caught by cops (audible in the background). And, oh yeah, Mr. Orange dies too.The plot is very original. A group of people who doesn't know each others names robs a jewelry store but the plan backfired. Someone tipped the cops and Mr. Pink thinks the rat is one of them. Great directing by Quentin Tarantino and a great cast. Harvey Keitel was outstanding. And so are the others like Madsen as the madman Mr. Blonde, Buscemi as the professional Mr. Pink and Roth as the rat, Mr. Orange. Added to that is the occasional voice-over of Steven Wright, the DJ of K-Billy's Super Sound of the Seventies. Excellent. A perfect ten for a perfect flick.",10,1,3,20 October 2006
Inside Man," My name is Dalton Russell...
","Directed by Spike Lee, this film is about a bank robber, a tough cop and a power fuel broker and the events that happens that makes them connected and linked to each other. The bank robber, Dalton Russell, portrayed by the British fellow Clive Owen, along with his band of robbing ragtags holds a bank a hostage and won't release them until their demands are met. But not is all as it seems. Then enters a tough cop with his trusty partner (Denzel Washington and Chiwetel Ejiofor respectively) who tries to negotiate with the bank robbers aided by the police chief Darius (Willem Dafoe). The bank robbers' demands are: two buses, a 747 Jet and food. The last one was already taken care of but the other two still remains a mystery to them. Why would the bank robbers bring their hostages all the way? Then, another plot comes in. The owner of the bank, Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer) hires Madeliene (Jodie Foster) to retrieve something from the safety deposit box inside the bank. You know, talk her way through the bank robbers and get the valuable possession that Arthur wants back. Whatever that was, it sure sounds very important to him and is shant be revealed to the public of its contains. Here comes the main ingredient of the whole movie: The robbers led by Dalton didn't rob the bank for the money, I mean not the green money in boxes and is hidden safely in the vault, they held the bank hostage because they want what Madeliene want: the mysterious item owned by Arthur.I'm not gonna tell you the whole story, you find that out for yourself. But I have one thing to say, its one of the best heist thriller flicks I've seen in a quite a while. Great acting by Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster. Support cast that includes Christopher Plummer, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Willem Dafoe were top-notch too. Congratulations to Spike Lee and his dedicated crew for making an excellent movie worth remembering. A good heist movie for the whole family...well, not the WHOLE family, some parts of it yeah.",9,1,2,2 November 2006
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," McCheesy's take on 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'
","Guy Ritchie is a genius. He turned a seemingly generic card-themed flick into something magnificent I don't even know where to start. Okay, so basically four guys, Nick, Tom, Bacon and Soap shell out their life savings so they can join a high-stakes card game with local mob boss Hatchet Harry. It turns out the game was rigged and the four of them ended up owing Harry half a million pounds and they have a week to come up with the money. Their 'genius' plan to come up with the money draws the ire of some notable figures of London's underbelly like marijuana-dealer Rory Breaker, old school London thug Dog and debt collector Big Chris. The events that will follow is either a) funny, b) hilariously funny, c) wickedly entertaining or d) just pure black comedy genius.This film is just too darn good. Its a healthy mix of black comedy, style, flair, wickedness, dark humor and awesome, magnificent turn of events. The casting and characterization is perfect, and Ritchie isn't afraid to move the cameras around; no pretense is really made here at 'realism' - Ritchie doesn't mask the fact that it's a film and he runs with it.The dialogs were perfect that is if you understand what the hell they're saying. At first if you don't understand the dialogs, just be patient because you'll get used to it.The last 30 minutes or so is probably the highest point of the film. All these colorful characters collide each with their own agendas and you will be laughing until the end. The closing frame of the film will either shock you or leave you in a cliff, hanging. The ending of the film is probably one of the greatest movie endings of all time with the accompaniment of that catchy song, this film is overall one heck of a treat. I had a blast watching it and I'm pretty sure it will stay with me forever.'Its been emotional' - Classic. A must-see. 10",10,6,9,5 June 2008
The Da Vinci Code," The Da Vinci Code
","'Seek The Truth' Dan Brown's controversial best-selling novel about a powerful secret that's been kept under wraps for thousands of years comes to the screen in this suspense thriller from director Ron Howard. The stately silence of Paris' Louvre museum is broken when one of the gallery's leading curators is found dead on the grounds, with strange symbols carved into his body and left around the spot where he died. Hoping to learn the significance of the symbols, police bring in Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), a gifted cryptographer who is also the victim's granddaughter. Needing help, Sophie calls on Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), a leading symbologist from the United States. As Sophie and Robert dig deeper into the case, they discover the victim's involvement in the Priory of Sion, a secret society whose members have been privy to forbidden knowledge dating back to the birth of Christianity. In their search, Sophie and Robert happen upon evidence that could lead to the final resting place of the Holy Grail, while members of the priory and an underground Catholic society known as Opus Dei give chase, determined to prevent them from sharing their greatest secrets with the world. Also starring Ian McKellen, Jean Reno, and Alfred Molina, The Da Vinci Code was shot on location in France and the United Kingdom; the Louvre allowed the producers to film at the famous museum, but scenes taking place at Westminster Abbey had to filmed elsewhere when church officials declined permission.I remember reading the book a long time ago and as soon as news broke out that a film was in the works, I was so pumped. The book was a good read so I was eager to see how they'll interpret the novel to the big screen. I went nuts over this movie when Ron Howard was on board to direct and he's leading an all-star cast so my anticipation meter reached sky high.While I can say that I was entertained, it was a bit disappointing in some points. They edited out a lot of crucial and important key scenes that was present in the novel, I know they had to consider time constraints but they should have just wiped out some minor less-important parts in the movie. I guess that's what you get when your anticipation reaches sky high.Ron Howard does the job of entertaining us for almost two hours and the pace never slows down. The acting was great although I'm still having a hard time with Tom Hanks' killer mullet. Audrey Tautou, one of my favorite actresses, handles her English diction very well and she matches up with Hanks' on screen charisma. Ian McKellen is an effective villain and so is white albino monk Silas portrayed by Paul Bettany.",6,0,2,6 October 2008
The Happening," McCheesy's take on 'The Happening'
","I don't know what the hell is up with the people saying that this film sucked bigtime or M. Night losing his touch, going downhill blah blah blah. This film was good that's that. Some people just hate M. Night so much that when they entered the theaters, their minds is set for one thing: this movie is bad. They didn't even give the film a chance, those Night haters weren't looking for the good things, they're looking for the bad. 'Mark Wahlberg's weakest performance' this, 'where the hell is the twist?' that. Okay, this may not be Night's best film ever (Sixth Sense for life) but this isn't his worst either (Lady in the Water still holds the title). This film is good, it may have its fair share of gaping plot holes or absurd sequences, but the film as a whole is good. Here's why: first, the acting. Mark's performance wasn't that bad, the critics had it all wrong. His performance was supposed to be that way, childish, immature and a guy who freaks out a lot. Remember the scene where he's teaching a class and then ducks when he sees the vice principal? Then there's this scene about the cough syrup thing which sounds like it came from a 10 year old and then there's the part where he freaked out and he says 'Just give me a minute!', its all intentional. His character is supposed to be childish and immature because in the end, it will be a big factor for their survival. The same thing can be applied to Zooey Deschanel's character Alma. Alma is as childish as Mark's character Elliot.So you see, the people who saw the performance and disliked it got it all wrong, it was actually pretty good. Second, the whole 'Where's the twist?' bit. Okay, when Night made 'Sixth Sense', the audience dug the whole twist in the end and they wanted more twists out of him, and so he did in three more films. They got pretty bored with the twists so Night stopped and made two twist-less films. And then when he made this film, with his infamous twist being a no-show, the people didn't like it mainly because the juicy twist isn't present. I swear when I saw the film when the credits rolled, I heard this guy saying: 'Where the hell is the twist? Oh my, this movie is ----'. A bit of advice to Night, don't listen to other people. Just follow what's in your gut because the people have different tastes and you can't satisfy them all so follow your instincts.And lastly, the plants did it. In case you were wondering who killed those people. The plants were releasing toxins that's blocking some neurotransmitters in the human brain doing some bad stuff, fatal stuff into your body. I thought the plot was really good. Nobody has ever done a film about killer plants in the past 25 years, 50 years maybe. An original concept but people are just too busy bashing Night and putting his head in the gutter. I'm not a fanboy of his or whatever, I just wanted to straighten some things about this film. I know a bad film when I see one and this one isn't. Its too bad the majority of the people are Night haters.7/10",7,3,9,15 June 2008

Understand? Now, I have done nothing to harm these people but they are angered with me, so what do they do, doctor up some income tax, for which they have no case. To speak to me like me, no, to harass a peaceful man. I pray to god if I ever had a grievance I'd have a little more self respect. One more thing, you have an all out prize fight, you wait until the fight is over, one guy is left standing. And that's how you know who won.' Kevin Costner stars as Ness, a federal agent who has come to Chicago during the Prohibition Era, when corruption in the local police department is rampant. His mission is to put crime lord Capone (Robert De Niro) out of business, but Capone is so powerful and popular that Ness is not taken seriously by the law or the press. One night, discouraged, he meets a veteran patrolman, Jimmy Malone (Sean Connery), and discovers that the acerbic Irishman is the one honest man he's been seeking. Malone has soon helped Ness recruit a gunslinger rookie, George Stone (Andy Garcia), and, joined by nebbish accountant Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), the men doggedly pursue Capone and his illegal interests. At first a laughingstock, Ness soon has Capone outraged over his and Malone's sometimes law-bending tactics, and the vain mobster strikes back in vicious style. Ultimately, it is the most unexpected and minor of crimes, tax evasion, which proves Capone's undoing.A pretty amazing film by Scarface director Brian De Palma. One of De Palma's best although I still consider his epic film Scarface as his best film ever but still, this film delivers all the goods when it comes to the gangster genre. I can't really say that it was excellent because the script to me seems lacking and sometimes it suffers from plot holes and a cheesy, over the top death scene. It was a good death (I won't mention who dies for the sake of spoilers) but it was cheesy. Good, in a cheesy kind of way.Although, I think what made this film work was the superb acting by Class A Hollywood stars. You got Robert De Niro as Al Capone (the 'baseball' scene is an instant favorite of mine), the guy never made a bad film according to my book. And in every film that he stars in, he gets better and better and better. De Niro is a method actor and The Untouchables just showed us how committed he really is to the job.On the other side of the law, you got Kevin Costner, Sean Connery and Andy Garcia, who all gave pretty impressive performances.",7,4,6,17 September 2008
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," McCheesy's take on 'Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny'
","I had a good time watching this one. Although this film doesn't size up in terms of storyline and/or plot development, the music made it all up for me. It was rockin. You can consider this a musical perhaps because of all the rockin and head-bangin taking place and I tell you, its one hell of a musical. The songs were supervised of course by Tenacious D and I guarantee you, if you're a fan of rock and roll, you will absolutely love this one. The songs gave me the LSS and that happens to me rarely.Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins and David Grohl (of the Foo Fighters) made cameo appearances which was a delight. Tim Robbins as a bum with a bum leg was so hilarious, I couldn't stop laughing. The rockin duo of course were funny as hell. The comedic timing and the delivery of jokes were spot-on. Add to that the crackalackin' music of Jables and Rage Kage and you're in for a musical rockin extravaganza you've never experienced before.7/10",7,0,0,28 July 2008
The Green Mile," McCheesy's take on 'The Green Mile'
","Paul Edgecomb is a slightly cynical veteran prison guard on Death row in the 1930's. His faith, and sanity, deteriorated by watching men live and die, Edgecomb is about to have a complete turn around in attitude. Enter John Coffey, He's eight feet tall. He has hands the size of waffle irons. He's been accused of the murder of two children... and he's afraid to sleep in a cell without a night-light. And Edgecomb, as well as the other prison guards - Brutus, a sympathetic guard, and Percy, a stuck up, perverse, and violent person, are in for a strange experience that involves intelligent mice, brutal executions, and the revelation about Coffey's innocence and his true identity.This one right here is a cinematic gem hands-down. Frank Darabont created such a sad sad story believe it or not folks, I cried like a leaked faucet. Such event occurs only on a blue moon so I guess this film holds a special place in my deep, dank heart. What made this film really stand out is that the director, Frank Darabont used contrasting plot elements and combined them seamlessly. In this case, the plot device of miracles and faith healing (during the Depression era in the States) which was perfectly embodied by Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey, the Death Row inmate who possesses a special gift of faith healing. The other contrasting element is the backdrop of the story, a jailhouse wing managed by Tom Hank's character Paul Edgecomb. An unlikely situation in an unlikely place, a combination that worked within the film.Excellent performances from Tom Hanks and surprisingly Michael Clarke Duncan. Why haven't we seen him in more dramatic roles like these? Kudos also to the rest of the cast, Barry Pepper, David Morse, Sam Rockwell and Doug Hutchison who by the way, have created a very thieving, mischievous, vile rat of a character. He definitely deserved his fate in the end.The Green Mile is a gem.",10,0,2,5 September 2008
The Wrestler," 'I'm an old broken down piece of meat and I deserve to be alone, I just don't want you to hate me'
","A deeply moving film that tugs your emotional heartstrings in all the right places, The Wrestler is as real as you can get, its honest to the core and absolutely no BS. Aronofsky told us a story and he told it at flaming speed. Coupled with great set design and amazing cinematography (I just can't get enough of those over the shoulder shots), The Wrestler is a defining moment in 2008 cinema and it is gonna be remembered for the years to come.I know its all said and done, but Mickey Rourke gives a career defining performance as Randy 'The Ram'. Rourke is Ram, there can be no other actor who can portray the character like Rourke did. The Ram reflects Rourke's real life struggles and he puts it to good use by using his raw, unnerved emotions on-screen. Tomei also knocked it out the ballpark portraying a sullen, single mom working as a stripper at a nightclub. The spark between her and Rourke is just pure magic but with a depressing mix to the equation when you realize these are people who are in the twilight of their careers and they have nobody else to turn to but each other. Evan Rachel Wood plays the daughter and although she is only seen in a couple or so scenes, she makes up for it with great acting and no doubt, this stunning lady is going places. Aronofsky, known for his previous depressing and sad films, gives us another one to cry our hearts out on so if you still haven't seen the film, ready your Kleenex because the ending will be one for the books.A must see.",9,1,2,4 January 2009
Hancock," McCheesy's take on 'Hancock'
","I just saw it. I can't say I was impressed but it is something. Did you know that this is the first summer blockbuster superhero movie that didn't originate from the comic books? Well, now you know.Will Smith, the bringer of the dollar dollar bills does it once again. He made yet another blockbuster of a film and he's been doing it since 1995 when Bad Boys came out. This time around he plays not-so-super hero Hancock, an alcoholic, gruff, lazy superhero who does more damage saving the world than the villains. It starts out fantastic, complete with the delish CG effects and crass, humorous jokes but then when we get to the second act of the film, it gets serious. To avoid massive spoilers, I will only say this: The minute Hancock gets thrown out a window and into a car, it all gets overly serious for a film of its genre. Think of Ang Lee's 'Hulk' but not that serious.They say the serious-ness didn't work but I say, it worked well and it served its purpose. It is necessary to the plot and it is a device used to show Hancock's past and his involvement with some other character (not Jason Bateman).The ending will make you cringe. Its not one of those typical superhero endings where the hero fights the villain and everything around them is imploding and exploding, this one took a right turn from the typical norm alley and I must say it worked for me. Who says you need big explosions for an ending huh? 'Hancock' is a serious superhero film. But not like 'Hulk'-serious. Put aside the jokes and the laughter and you'll see it. Its not big or epic for its kind and I can't say that I was impressed but as I said before, it is something.",6,1,4,5 July 2008
Defiance," We may be hunted like animals, but we will not become animals
","The movie was good. Not Zwick's best effort though and as for the acting it was Liev Schreiber that delivered the most. Every time I see Craig I see James Bond and that other guy, Jamie Bell, was barely even on screen. I'm guessing most of his scenes were cut out of the film to pave the way for more Craig screen time. The action set pieces were mostly impressive but the problem is, its over before you know it. But I can honestly say, it was impressive nonetheless. Its not brainless by any means, the movie has a profound and compelling story. One can only wonder how these filmmakers come up with more WWII movie ideas every year.From a visual point of view, the movie looks absolutely beautiful. From the authentic weaponry and uniforms to the rich and colorful Lithuanian locations, Defiance may fall flat during some points throughout the film; as with every other black and white war movies that's been released, the Germans are depicted as war machines of death without remorse, if you can overlook these flaws I think it is an enjoyable film and in its entirety, Defiance is an overwhelming movie that doesn't glamorize the war but shows the intense reality behind it all. A must see for all war movie fans out there.",8,124,207,7 January 2009
WALL·E," McCheesy's take on 'Wall-E'
","In a distant, but not so unrealistic future, where mankind has abandoned earth because it has become covered with trash from products sold by the powerful multi-national Buy N Large corporation, WALL-E, a garbage collecting robot has been left to clean up the mess. Mesmerized with trinkets of earth's history and show tunes, WALL-E is alone on Earth except for a sprightly pet cockroach. One day, Eve, a sleek (and dangerous) reconnaissance robot, is sent to earth to find proof that life is once again sustainable. WALL-E falls in love with Eve. WALL-E rescues Eve from a dust storm and shows her a living plant he found amongst the rubble. Consistent with her 'directive' Eve takes the plant and automatically enters a deactivated state except for a blinking green beacon. WALL-E, doesn't understand what has happened to his new friend, but true to his love, he protects her from wind, rain, and lightning, even as she is unresponsive. One day a massive ship comes to reclaim Eve, but WALL-E, out of love or loneliness hitches a ride on the outside of the ship to rescue Eve. The ship arrives back at a large space cruise ship, which is carrying all of the humans who evacuated earth 700 years earlier. The people of earth ride around this space resort on hovering chairs which give them a constant feed of TV and video chatting. They drink all of their meals through a straw out of laziness and/or bone loss, and are all so fat that they can barely move. When the auto-pilot computer, acting on hastily given instructions sent many centuries before, tries to prevent the people of earth from returning, by stealing the plant, WALL-E, Eve, the portly captain, and a band of broken robots stage a mutiny.I consider this the Godfather of animated films. Not only was it just a breakthrough when it comes to animated films, it also brought the genre of animation into a whole new another level.Wall-E is where science fiction meets romance meets comedy meets the heart and soul of every movie going audience who've seen the film. I'm not sure about the other people but this film captured me hook, line and sinker. Believe it or not this is by far the most romantic film I have seen this year. Going into the theaters I immediately expected greatness seeing as its a Pixar film but goddamn it the romance angle just came out of nowhere. And I got hooked. And here I thought I'd never see the day where I'd cheer for two metallic pieces of junk falling in love.The story of the film is beyond greatness. In fact, the undertone message it delivered was more fun and enjoyable than Al Gore's sleepfest docu 'An Inconvenient Truth'. After I saw the film, I was thinking what if this could happen in the future? Well, not in the literal term but what if every little thing we do, even the basic things in life, we're gonna have to need the assistance of a machine? Right now maybe you're thinking its impossible but if you observe the modern society today, with technology rapidly evolving and growing, I'm starting to think we're heading to Wall-E's world already. Just think about it.",10,0,2,16 August 2008
The Terminal," McCheesy's take on 'The Terminal'
","While Viktor Navorski is en route to the U.S. to fulfill a wish of his late father's, there is a coup in the Eastern European country in which he lives. When he lands at JFK, he learns that his country is no longer recognized by the U.S. so he cannot enter - and he can't go home either, because all planes to his country are canceled. While waiting in this limbo, Viktor takes up residence in JFK Terminal and learns another definition of home.Okay first off, this is not Spielberg's worst film ever as some people might tell you. I think 'War of the Worlds' is his worst or even the newly-released 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'. Admittedly it is not his best film ever. 'The Terminal' is a film in-between if we're talking about Steven Spielberg's film slate. The dialogue and the script wasn't that bad and I wouldn't consider Tom Hanks' accent as rubbish. The story will hook you from the minute it starts up until the end. Spielberg and crew has managed to balance a fine line between the dramatic parts and the comedic timing without one overlapping the other. Tom Hanks' portrayal as the man from the fictional country Krakozhia was effective in my opinion. His likability as an actor was effortlessly transitioned in his Navorski character.'The Terminal' is an 8.",8,0,1,26 August 2008
Blow," Blow
","Based on a True Story.Following the life of cocaine-trafficking pioneer George Jung in a way that recalls Martin Scorsese's Casino, Blow recounts the man's days from his 1950s childhood in Boston to his downfall in the 1980s. George (played by Johnny Depp) begins his life as the son of Fred (Ray Liotta), an earnest breadwinner, and Ermine (Rachel Griffiths), who frequently walks out on them in pursuit of a more fulfilling life. When George moves west to California in the late '60s, accompanied by best pal Tuna (Ethan Suplee), he becomes an entrepreneur in the marijuana business, which soon spreads to the East Coast as well, with girlfriend Barbara (Franka Potente) smuggling the product during her stewardess shifts. George is arrested in 1972 -- at which time Barbara dies of cancer -- but George finds a new ally in Diego (Jordi Molla), who proposes the idea that he become the American conduit for Colombian kingpin Pablo Escobar (Cliff Curtis). George flourishes in the heyday of the disco era, and falls for Mirtha (Penelope Cruz), a self-serving bombshell who eventually has a daughter with him. Trouble escalates as the FBI threatens to bring George and his crew down, while he desperately tries to be a stable parent to his young offspring. Blow also features Paul Reubens and Max Perlich in featured roles.Review: Blow is a drug film, and yet I find it touching and emotional. Its not one of those typical hard-edged drug related movies like Scarface, they shook the ground a little bit by giving the main character a heart. And they developed it more as it basically became the main theme in the third act of the film, the shaky relationship between George Jung and his daughter Katrina was well-developed and you kind of feel bad to George when he took the fall and ended up in prison for 60 years. The ending is totally heart breaking and as the credits roll, you'll almost be in tears.Johnny Depp in one of the best roles he's ever done took the role of an ambitious small town drug smuggler and he gave it a heart. You actually feel sorry for the real George Jung and Depp definitely gave justice to the role. Penelope Cruz steals every scene she's in by flailing her arms wildly and shouting at the top of her lungs (well, that's that one scene only and it was in my opinion, excellently done). 'Blow' will definitely blow you away, its El Magico.",9,0,1,21 October 2008
Iron Man," McCheesy's take on 'Iron Man'
","I finally got to see this the other day. It was actually pretty good and I strongly believe it lived up to its hype. It had a solid plot, Robert Downey Jr's charisma is all over the film and every scene with him is above genius. He was indeed the perfect choice to play the title role. Gwyneth Paltrow, Terence Howard and Jeff Bridges also delivers in their respective roles. The CGI effects was fantastic. That's all I can say: Fantastic.The armor designs (Mark I, II and III) were beautifully crafted. From the metal junk that Tony Stark created inside the cave to the Hot Rod Mark III design, its all a geek's (even normal people) fantasy dream put into celluloid. A couple of visual effects-laden scenes will assuringly take your breath away. The most notable is the part where Iron Man is high up in the air evading two Jet fighters. Pure eye candy delight. Also, there's this one scene where Iron Man intervenes in a terrorist activity somewhere in Afghanistan blasting the baddies into little smithereens. He looked really awesome in that scene. I assure you, watching this film will satisfy your hunger for CGI.But of course, in every CGI summer blockbuster film there is some weak points that might or might not bring down the whole film. Obadiah Stane's last minute transformation to Iron Monger was really uncalled for. Seems to me it was probably just an excuse so that Iron Man will have a sparring partner near the end of the film. They could've just pulled off a story where Obadiah creates like a thousand unmanned Iron Mongers and program them to eliminate Iron Man. That should keep our metallic hero busy. Probably a better scenario for an ending battle scene but what the heck, its just probably me. The action scenes were scarce too. But since the film is mostly focused on Tony Stark's transformation into Iron Man and his origins, it is probably forgivable.By the way, they managed to put in some SHIELD references which is probably a make-way for a sequel or maybe even an Avengers movie down the line. Also, they gave us hints of superheroes (and a villain) who will likely appear in the sequel and share screen time with our hero Iron Man. Like Nick Fury and his 'Avengers Initiative' who makes a surprising cameo after the end credits. There's also Jim Rhodes and his War Machine alter ego whose line 'Maybe next time baby' is a foreshadowing of his imminent turn into a superhero. The Ten Rings terrorist organization is obviously a direct nod to a possible sequel villain: The Mandarin.Overall, I'd say a pretty decent superhero movie although there were some weak points but you can't avoid that in films these large and epic. Director Jon Favreau did his homework, he started the Iron Man franchise with an origin story. Robert Downey's charisma and machismo suits the character Tony Stark and his alter ego Iron Man very well and here's hoping for a bigger and much epic (with more fight scenes) sequel.

Munich," McCheesy's take on 'Munich'
","Ben Stone (Seth Rogen): 'You know what movie I just saw again the other day, which is bleeping, like, mind-blowing and I haven't seen it since it came out is Munich.' Jay (Jay Baruchel): 'Oh, Munich!' Jonah (Jonah Hill): 'Oh, man, Munich bleep rules.' Jay: 'Munich is awesome!' Ben: 'That movie was Eric Bana kicking bleep ass! Through every movie with Jews, we're the ones getting killed. Munich flips it on its ear. We're capping motherbleep.' Jonah: 'Not only killing but bleep, like, taking names.' An excerpt from the film 'Knocked Up' pretty much sums it up for me. Munich bleeping rules. That's that. No questions asked.When a group of Palestinians killed a bunch of Israelis in the 1972 Munich Olympics, the Israeli version of CIA - Mossad assigns the son of a war hero, Avner and four more people to hunt down and assassinate 11 people who had a hand in the Munich massacre. Avner is portrayed by Eric Bana. He played the role perfectly. He is the ultimate choice for the role of Avner. His emotions are so surreal it scares you.The script is fantastic. I sometimes have problems with lengthy movies because sometimes its just two and a half hour of chock-full dialogues and the boredom sets in. But in Munich, I wanted more. The dialogues are there and at the same time the action is also present. Every hit they take is breath taking, like literally it will take your breath away. Its like going for a dip in an ocean and there's a shark behind you and you're scared as hell, that's the feeling that I felt every time they kill someone. Ciaran Hinds, Mathieu Kassovitz, Daniel Craig, Hanns Zischler, Ayelet Zurer and Geoffrey Rush co-stars and every each one of them were A-okay for me.Director Steven Spielberg made an absolute masterpiece. Every little thing is perfect, the acting, the music, cinematography, editing every little bit is well planned and well executed.This film is not black propaganda. Its an epic tale of vengeance, loyalty, betrayal and paranoia. Munich is a 10 and highly recommended.",9,0,0,30 May 2008
Pineapple Express," Pineapple Express
","'Put this in your pipe and smoke it.' Process server Dale Denton (Seth Rogen) has a grudging business relationship with the laconic Saul Silver (James Franco), deigning to visit only to purchase Saul's primo product -- a rare new strain of pot called Pineapple Express.But when Dale becomes the only witness to a murder by a crooked cop (Rosie Perez) and the city's most dangerous drug lord (Gary Cole), he panics and dumps the Pineapple Express at the scene. When it's traced back to him, Dale and Saul run for their lives... and they quickly discover that they're not just suffering from weed-fueled paranoia.If they survive, these two just might become real friends. All aboard the Pineapple Express.REVIEW: Pineapple Express is yet another comedy hit from the Apatow posse and by far one of the funniest movies of 2008 alongside Step Brothers. David Gordon Green, one of the finest director Hollywood has to offer, easily transitioned his A-game from heavy set dramatic piece Snow Angels to this: a laugh out loud, hysterical, riotous comedy romp. The buddy chemistry between Seth Rogen's Dale Denton and James Franco's Saul Silver glued perfectly. Franco's hilarious turn as lovable and trustworthy drug dealer Saul shines at every scene he's in, he basically just steals the show from everyone around and even scene-stealer Rogen just stayed behind him, not in front where he usually is.Now, I'm not saying Rogen didn't shine in the movie, his role, just like every other role he's done as a lazy slacker, every day stoner and the number one customer to Saul's drug enterprise. He just basically nailed it, he's so used to playing the role that he need not exert effort to act, he's good at what he does and that's what makes him one of the budding comedic actors today.Hysterical and and laugh out loud scenes are very abundant in the movie, right from the start and until it ends, you will not stop laughing. From the solid deliveries, the new and freshly picked gags and jokes from the mind of screenwriters Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen and to the memorable and instant classic quotes, Pineapple Express is one of the funniest films I've seen so I highly recommend it if you're into stoner comedies or just to have a good laugh. All aboard.",9,0,2,22 October 2008
Jackie Brown," MC's take on 'Jackie Brown'
","Jackie Brown: 'Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waiting on people almost 20 years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits that ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothing to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that sht is scarier than Ordell.' Jackie Brown is the name of a flight attendant who gets caught smuggling her boss' gun money on the airline she works for. Luckily for her, the Fed Ray Nicolet and the LA Cop Mark Dargus decide to team up in order to arrest the arms dealer she works for, whose name they don't even know. Here's when she has to choose one way: tell Nicolet and Dargus about Ordell Robbie (the arms dealer) and get her freedom -except that if Ordell suspects you're talking about him, you're dead- or keep her mouth shut and do some time. That's when she meets Max Cherry -her bail bondsman-, a late fifties, recently separated, burnt-out man, who falls in love with her. Then Jackie comes up with a plan to play the Feds off against Ordell and the guys he works with -Louis Gara and Melanie Ralston, among others- and walk off with their money. But she needs Max's help. No one is going to stand in the way of his million dollar payoff...I liked Quentin Tarantino better when he's borrowing concepts and ideas from other films and making it uniquely his own. Just kidding. I still dig this film even though there's no flashy editing and the style is lesser than the substance. I don't know, I guess QT's magic works better if he's homaging movies after movies (ie, Kill Bill 1 and 2, Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction) This time around, Tarantino worked his way around an engaging script, a stellar cast and amazing acting courtesy of lead Pam Grier as the titular character, Samuel L. Jackson as Ordell and believe it or not, Chris Tucker's performance was hilariously amazing. Even though his character never did see the end of the film, jousting cuss words with Samuel L. Jackson is no easy feat. John Travolta's Vincent Vega was annihilated by Jules' 'Superfly TNT, the Guns of Navarone!' and even the snakes pised their pants with Sam's 'I'm tired of this motherfn snakes on this motherfn plane!' Like in any other film by Quentin Tarantino, the script is more than amazing. It was engaging, satisfying and genuine. From the quirky one liners to Samuel L. Jackson's holier than thou cussing, this film is as real as you can get. Real characters dealing with real situations with real outcomes.People who bash Quentin a lot should learn a thing or two from this film. He's not all that copycat director you make him to be. He's just a guy who's seen a lot of films during his video store clerk days and loved it so he pays tribute to it by making films. This one however is a step out his usual norm and I must say, he still nailed it. This is why QT is one of my favorite directors out there.",8,1,1,10 September 2008
Sin City," 'An old man dies. A young girl lives. Fair trade. I love you Nancy'
","I bought this on DVD days ago and decided to watch it on a night time to get that that dark and gloomy mood that people who've seen it was talking about. So, the film starts in this balcony of a building or som'n and we see The Salesman (Josh Hartnett) kill an unlucky target. Then, we see ourselves in a prologue of one of the three story lines 'The Yellow Bastard'. Hartigan (Willis) rescues an 11 year old Nancy Callahan from a freak pedophile nincompoop from the powerful Roark family, Junior Roark. This is the first scene where we see the brutality, Hartigan shoots Junior like it was traget practice and he shoots his 'manly organ' off. But then, out of the blue, Hartigan's long-time partner, Bob (Michael Madsen) backstabs Hartigan and shoots him like he was target practice, thus, the tagline 'Hell of a way to end partnership'. Bob was on Roark's payroll, so it has got to be done.The next scene delves us in the second storyline, 'The Hard Goodbye'. Its basically about Marv (Mickey Rourke) killing his way through the top and finds the murderer who killed Goldie (Jaime King) while she is sleeping with him. The dialogue in this part is outstanding and Mickey Rourke portrays Marv like he IS Marv. Minor characters in this part includes Kevin, (Elijah Wood) a cannibalistic SOB who eats prostitutes for dinner. LITERALLY. We also see some of the Old Town prostitutes like Gail (Rosario Dawson) who has a much bigger role in 'The Big Fat Kill' and Wendy (also portrayed by Jaime King) who is actually Goldie's twin sister. Like all movies, the protagonist kills the antagonist brutally and the protagonist dies with content. Marv got his revenge.The next storyline (The Big Fat Kill) is about Dwight McCarthy (Clive Owen) whos trying to save Old Town from the evil dictator and mercenary Manute (Michael Clarke Duncan). Nothing to talk much about this storyline but this was also good. Brittany Murphy, Benicio Del Toro, Rosario Dawson and Clive Owen gives off a good performance and as usual, its brutality at its finest. After Dwight offs Manute and his thugs and restores the truce between Old Town and the cops we return to 'The Yellow Bastard'. We see a bed-ridden Hartigan and Senator Roark (Powers Boothe) who tells him that when Hartigan is up and running, he will connect all the crimes (child molesting and the castration of Junior) to him and he'll serve jail time. Hartigan with all his misery gives up and loses hope but that ended when Nancy writes to him every thursday under the name 'Cordelia' and with all his happiness, decides to live and content with the letters he receives. Then, the Yellow Bastard (Nick Stahl) comes in and gives him a bloodied letter with a finger in it. Thinking that Nancy's in danger, he gets out of jail and tracks Nancy. And tracked her he did. He found a now 19 year old Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba) in an erotic club with The Yellow Bastard hot on its tail. Hartigan lead the Yellow Bastard directly right to Nancy. With a few twists and turns, Hartigan ended up killing Junior by literally smashing him to bits and castrated his 'manly organ' again. The sad part is, he kills himself because when he killed the Yellow Bastard, the son of the powerful Senator Roark, he lit up the match that'll make the Senator blow up and thinks that he'll do anything to kill him and Nancy. 'An old man dies. A young girl lives. Fair trade'.The film, set in black and white and with the occasional touch of colors like the Customer's red gown, Becky's blue eyes and Manute's golden right eye. Robert Rodriguez with the special directing of Quentin Tarantino, gives us a new but an entirely new film in its genre. The brutality, the lighting, the score, the directing and the grimy and dark locales of Sin City makes this film attracts to the audience and one of its kind. Kudos to the people who've worked hard to create such a visual masterpiece. 10/10.",9,0,2,19 October 2006
Gangs of New York," Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York
","I've seen the movie yesterday along with Inside Man and Saw. Though a tad bit long, it never ceases to impress me. Martin Scorsese brings us yet one of his masterpieces and slaps it in our faces and tells us that he is one of the greatest directors in Hollywood. With the recent success of his latest direction 'The Departed', Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest director there ever was.OK, so the plot is simple but elegant. Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) returns to Five Points section to avenge the death of his father 'Priest' Vallon (Liam Neeson) who was slain by Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) sixteen years ago in an all-out territorial war in Five Points between the Native Americans led by Bill The Butcher and the Irish immigrants led by 'Priest' Vallon who calls themselves the 'Dead Rabbits'. Unfortunately they lost. So, it was goodbye to the Irish immigrants and hello to their new local leader Bill The Butcher. Amsterdam, witnessing the death of his father tries to escape, goes underground and hides the knife that took his father's life before he was caught and was taken in a place called 'Hellgate'. Now, 16 years had passed and we see a corrupt, impoverished and an already dying Five Points. All the people there must pay to Bill The Butcher for the pleasures he gives them. A local political sect called the Tammany Hall lead by Boss Tweed can't do nothing against Bill The Butcher's influential and massive power that's griping Five Points.So, Amsterdam, knowing that he can't match Bill's influence and power that he's got befriends him and Bill in exchange takes him under his wing and thinks of him as his own son. Their bond has gotten stronger when an attempt to kill Bill The Butcher was foiled by Amsterdam only wounding Bill in the shoulder and makes it less-lethal. This makes Amsterdam realize that his plan to kill Bill The Butcher is slowly fading away as his respect and devotion to him grows. But he didn't let the respect and devotion devour him. On one particular celebration, the day the Dead Rabbits died along with 'Priest Vallon, Amsterdam finally plans to kill Bill The Butcher in front of the public while celebrating the death of his honorable father. But, Johnny, a friend of Amsterdam betrays him just because he didn't get the girl of his dreams, Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz) who has fallen in love with Amsterdam. He tells Bill Amsterdam's real identity just before the celebration starts. So, this makes him aware that Amsterdam is trying to kill him that night. So, Amsterdam's plan failed and he was the one that was stabbed in the abdomen. Bill tortures him and left him to die. Thanks to Jenny, who took care of him while he's suffering the wounds that he got courtesy of Bill. When Amsterdam is up and running, he resurrects the name the Dead Rabbit and declares an all-out war to the Native Americans. It didn't go as planned because of the Draft Riots that put New York in a state of calamity. One thing led to another and Amsterdam ended up stabbing Bill The Butcher and eventually killing him.The cast was great. Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis and Cameron Diaz leads an all-star cast. They portray their respective roles with finesse and excellence. Daniel Day-Lewis, along with his New Yorker accent was the best villain I've seen since Saruman of Lord of the Rings. He portrays Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting with elegance and he goes with the flow. Its the first time I've seen him act and he was darn good. Too bad he died. Cameron Diaz was the one who should've died. LOl.Great sound score too. Whoever supervised the music was top-notch. The mood was just right there. And the song 'The Hands That Built America' by U2, though I'm not American, was one of my favorites. Its not the title, its the message. America today owes something to the people who built their country for what it is right now. 9/10.",8,0,1,2 November 2006
Windtalkers," McCheesy's take on 'Windtalkers'
","This has got to be the most retarded war film I have ever seen. John Woo desperately tries to make this a cinematic achievement he didn't notice that the more big unnecessary explosions he makes the more retarded and boring this film gets. From the awkward action scenes to the hilarious and stupid dialogs, this film is every shade of wrong.I had to actually painstakingly tread almost over two hours of this crappy heap of junk sht. This film single-handedly destroyed one of my favorite film genres ever. They tried to blend in a back story that concerns Sgt Enders' (Nicolas Cage) past and the wrong decisions he's made and it still haunts him after all this time yadda yadda. They tried to give Enders some sympathy votes from the audience because he was just following orders and all that stuff. I don't know about you but I really think this sympathy ploy failed miserably. Not that I'm a man with a heart made out of icicles , its just that the way the director did it is just too plain, dull, very UN-involving and boring.The war scenes wasn't a sight to behold. The camera angles is way too awkward and from a a guy who've seen a lot of war films, maybe the actors needed more time in boot camp. Talk about awkward.John Woo should learn a thing or two from 'Saving Private Ryan' before making another war flick. This one is a disgrace to war film lovers everywhere.",6,1,3,11 July 2008
The Island," Michael Bay's The Island
","Lincoln Six-Echo is a resident of a seemingly Utopian but contained facility in the mid 21st century. Like all of the inhabitants of this carefully controlled environment, Lincoln hopes to be chosen to go to the 'The Island' - reportedly the last uncontaminated spot on the planet. But Lincoln soon discovers that everything about his existence is a lie. He and all of the other inhabitants of the facility are actually human clones. Lincoln makes a daring escape with a beautiful fellow resident named Jordan Two-Delta. Relentlessly pursued by the forces of the sinister institute that once housed them, Lincoln and Jordan engage in a race for their lives to literally meet their makers.The plot is very original though I heard somewhere that this was copied from another movie whose title I forgot that has exactly the same storyline. But, copied or not, it don't matter because what matters the most is how they delivered it to us audiences. And, fortunately, this flick did one hell of a job. Great visuals, the sound is well-timed and man, the car chase scenes is off the hook. Especially, when Lincoln and Jordan rides the ubercool Jetbike of some sort all over the city. One scene that was obviously given the most effort is the car chase scene between a truck that carries railroad wheels with Lincoln and Jordan in it and Laurent's mercenaries. And when Lincoln starts dropping all those tonfuls of railroad wheels, my oh my, PURE DESTRUCTION DERBY I tell you. Cars defies gravity and goes flying everywhere. Especially the armored truck that did a perfect flip when a thousand tonne railroad wheel hit the bumper. God. Breath-taking. This is definitely one of Michael Bay's best films of all time. Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson gives off yet another good performance. You can't go wrong with Ewan's Scottish accent, its pretty catchy. And to all the others, Sean Bean, Steve Buscemi, Djimon Hounsou and Michael Clarke Duncan are great too.I should've given this film a perfect 10 but they killed off Steve Buscemi so that's a -2.

There were a bunch laugh out loud scenes. It was all outrageous and his character Jackie Moon is the epitome of idiocy.Woody Harrelson was a nice touch. Its good to see him in comedic roles, I think I last saw him in the Coen's gritty 'No Country'. Its a breath of fresh air for him.The funniest scene is the 'Jive Turkey' thing.
