Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Best thing since the bible
",I never been a fan of pirates films until I happened upon this monster of a franchise helmed by non other than Joshamee Gibbs. His actor holds nothing back and watching his performance is what can only be described as having a full blown orgasm in the cinema. Gibbs alone would get this film a 9/10 but the fact that we learn that he has a cousin named Jeremy raises it beyond human comprehension. This film should be called Pirates of the Caribbean: Joshamee Gibbs because he carries this film with his own bear hands. Also Johnny Depp is there but no one really cares about him.,10,0,1,11 July 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Everyone but me is wrong
","Read the title. Jabba the Hutt carries this film with his many iconic lines which will go down in Movie History like, 'My name is Jabba the Hutt' and 'Oh sugar! I left the stove on!'. Truly a Masterpiece and by far the best Star Wars film apart from the prequels, originals, episode VII and the Clone Wars. Would like to see more Joshamee Gibbs though as the film felt lacking in this department!",10,0,1,11 July 2017
Transformers," Pointers for a sequel
","Points to improve this movie in case it gets a sequel 1. Needs more Shia 2. Full blown nudity from Megan Fox 3.Less Transformers, more tits 4.Check Michael Bay for Mental disorder 5.Give Michael Bay a warehouse with more explosions 6.Shia Labeouf needs tits 7.Make Optimus prime have LGBT colours 8.Give Bumblebee voice of Kevin Hart 9.More TitsSo basically just make Pacific Rim",10,2,2,13 July 2017
