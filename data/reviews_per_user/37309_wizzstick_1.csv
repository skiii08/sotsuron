The Blair Witch Project," What rubbish!
",I'm sorry but this was total trash. Who ran round saying this was great and scary needs help! This is NOT a scary film unless you have a very excitable imagination. No wonder the makers are stunned. So are the rest of us. Very bad example of hype and marketing gone mad. All I can say to anyone is check with your friends and see what they thought of it. 0/5,Null,0,0,4 November 1999
