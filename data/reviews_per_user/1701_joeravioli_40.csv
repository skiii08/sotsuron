10 Cloverfield Lane," A bundle of massively entertaining scenarios squashed unceremoniously into one
","JJ Abrams called 10 Cloverfield Lane a 'spiritual successor' to Cloverfield, which proved to be one of the most subtle anti- spirituality comments made so far this year. In case you weren't aware, 'spiritual' is actually Abrams-speak for 'not at all'. Just as 'new', in relation to his addition to the Star Wars canon, actually meant 'rehashed and served on a glistening chrome platter'. In any case, don't trust Abrams, mega-multi-muchacho filmmaker though he is. Trust me instead.All the pieces of 10 Cloverfield Lane are really quite good. Each thrills sufficiently, and manages to provide substantial and effective suspense accompanied by excellent performances and solid direction by debut filmmaker Dan Trachtenberg. Despite taking on a high-concept approach, Trachtenberg never overwhelms his narrative, a feat given how often great concepts are squashed by vapid stories nowadays. However, when taken as a whole, the film feels curiously haphazard. Segments lack continuity, and the final fifteen minutes are akin to duck feet on a grizzly bear. As far as an under-budgeted claustrophobic thriller goes, it passes with flying colours as a prime example of gold- standard entertainment, but its strange construction makes it difficult to recommend.Mary Elizabeth Winstead stars as Michelle, who finds herself in a doomsday shelter with two men after a car accident. Although one of the men, Emmett, is the definition of harmlessness, Howard, played by John Goodman, is much more sinister. Howard is the man who built the shelter and brought Michelle there. He serves as the rough, taciturn authourity figure who sees all and knows all, acting supposedly in the best interests of the three members of his tiny, underground world. But Michelle isn't about to follow him without question. She immediately decides that all she wants to do is escape. Perhaps the most terrifying part of the film is not what's out there, but what's inside. Howard himself is a menacing, idiosyncratic figure who maintains his authourity with a thick ring of keys, a gun, and an iron fist. And yet, he may be not all that he seems. Michelle senses this right off the mark, fuelling her desire to escape. Thus begins their deliriously entertaining game of cat and mouse that plays tricks on our senses with creaks, thumps, and the occasional nasty shock. What makes it all the more terrifying is how frustratingly small the shelter is. A potent sense of claustrophobia is invoked within the viewer, as Michelle plots away against Howard behind his back, but without any knowledge of where that hulking, flabby back might be. While it's the suspense that drives the film, what elevates it beyond an uncommonly effective thriller are the remarkable performances by each of its three leads. Mary Elizabeth Winstead makes it easy to root for her character. Not only is she especially vulnerable as a woman living with two strange men, she's also an unprecedented badass with more tricks up her sleeve than a professional magician. John Gallagher Jr., while serving as the standard 'nice guy' character who offsets Howard's incessant humorlessness, provides the film's emotional foundation. John Goodman is absolutely petrifying, a villain disguised as a hero. His primary demeanour is that of unfathomable coldness, but his temper tantrums come frequently and with little provocation. In a way, he's a perverse father figure, the guy you spent your childhood tiptoeing around for fear of a beating. Shrouded in mystery, but with enough revealed to make us question his intentions, we spend much of the film guessing as to who Howard truly is beyond a lumbering source of jump scares. The film's ending is without a doubt the weirdest thing I've seen in a film all year. It isn't surreal or artsy -- common sources of weirdness, but it arrives like a bolt from the blue, a massive contrast with what came before. I've committed to no-spoiler reviews, so I won't tell you exactly what happens. Chances are that you won't like it, but I did. In fact, I loved it. I found it extremely satisfying, and, well, a pretty gosh darn awesome fifteen minutes of pure exhilaration accompanied by a wonderfully climactic finale and a perfect resolution to Michelle's character arc.Only problem is, it's tangential. The story is segmented by this strange turn of events, which has little, if anything to do with what came before. In any film, unless it's an artistic choice -- which I'm sure Abrams would insist -- a lack of continuity is a major, major problem.Too many people call 10 Cloverfield Lane a JJ Abrams film. Sure, he produced it. But anyone who knows anything about JJ Abrams should also know that he isn't able to do something like this. Abrams' films are big stories with big budgets meant to be viewed on big screens, and no, Super 8 isn't an exception. So to put 10 Cloverfield Lane's pen in Abrams' hand is a travesty indeed, because to do so negates Trachtenberg's surprising feat: He has created a small story with a small budget, but one that thrills, chills, and spills on a massive scale.",9,0,1,11 September 2016
The Maze Runner," Although the setup is mildly engaging, The Maze Runner fails to satisfy
","The Maze Runner is definitely not the worst teenage-directed dystopian flick out there (I believe that Divergent has that one locked down), but it is definitely not the best, either. Its setup is interesting and builds adequate suspense to keep us watching with slightly interested eyes, but it falls apart with its repeated, clich√©d, TV drama like dialogue. It serves to forward the plot, but often tends to show little of anything, really. And it happens a lot. Most of the film is spent talking, mostly about the maze as a sacred, untouchable thing that no one should go into under the consequence of death by the monsters that lurk within the maze. The action, when it happens, is fun, but it doesn't happen often enough.The film follows a boy named Thomas who is cast into a mini society put together by a group of boys that live in the center of a maze, in a place they call the Glade. Every month, an elevator comes out of the ground with food and a new boy. No one can remember anything before they came into the Glade, although Thomas has visions of symbols and people in his dreams. No one is allowed past the doors that mark the entrance to the Maze except the Runners, a designated group of kids who map the maze in order to attempt to find a way out. The doors close at night and open in the morning. Alby, the group leader, warns Thomas, 'No one survives a night in the maze.' Of course, Thomas is curious about the maze.The Maze Runner follows what I like to call 'The Avalanche Framework'. A person or event disrupts the quiet structure of a strict society, causing it to spiral out of control, inciting absolute panic and chaos within its 'walls'. Events snowball together into a massive avalanche that destroys everything that the people who created the society ever worked for. It is usually an enjoyable film to watch, and the endings are usually satisfying. The Maze Runner lacks a satisfying ending (It is random and senseless), but it is enjoyable to a certain, very small extent. It holds you by the tips of your toes, never gripping your eyes to the screen or pulling you to the edge of your seat. There is barely anything to make you want to keep watching.The Maze Runner is surprisingly dark. That is probably the best thing it has going for it. It is more gory and frightening than most teenage movies (although this may not be a good thing), and the helplessness of the whole situation is a feeling uncommon as well to these types of films.It is a reasonable film, bordering between good and bad. Me being me, I give it the benefit of the doubt.",6,17,25,31 March 2015
Zootopia," Comrade Stalin would be proud
","Although a children's film with a political message may sound off- putting, Disney scoots around outright indoctrination by making itself as unsubtle as possible. It doesn't take a genius to put two and two together, and in this case, four manifests as a plainly obvious 'profiling based on biological heritage (aka racism) is bad'. It's completely harmless, but shouldn't happen again. Now I don't mean to sound like a doomsday prophet, but this might be only the beginning, a calculated TEST DRIVE for indoctrination in children's films, the first of a slew of increasingly subtle political weapons focused on mass hypnosis. And with these puff pieces, Disney will establish its iron grip over not only our entertainment, but our very SOULS.I'm kidding. But seriously, though. The entertainment industry shouldn't be educating kids.Gladly, Zootopia has much to offer beyond an awkward ditty on racism. The story is action-packed and intelligently executed, the animation is typically gorgeous, and the thrills come fast and hard. Although it occasionally feels like a frustratingly juvenile music video, it's mostly stellar entertainment that's sure to please kids and adults alike. It's especially timely as a film that breaks Disney's cold streak of artificial and unoriginal fluff, which comes as a personal relief.Zootopia plays like a furry, buddy-cop hoodunit with all the warm, fuzzy fixings. Judy Hopps, the first rabbit on the Zootopia Police Force, is an idealistic young rabbit raring to make a difference. But, as with every eager beaver these days, her dreams are quickly crushed by a careless 'meter maid' assignment, cold-blooded (though not literally) superiors, and a particularly eye-opening encounter with a wily fox, who, just in case you were wondering, is a fox. And yes, I suppose you'd call him wily.From this setup, the film bounds into charted, but massively entertaining territory as the unlikely rabbit-fox duo find themselves cracking the case of a streak of missing mammals across Zootopia. As a caper filled with twists and turns, guffaw-inducing humour, and surprising depth of character, Zootopia succeeds brilliantly. As an added bonus, the wit is present and ever-so- obvious, ranging from tricks of the eye to comical verbal gags. There's a scene in which Judy says that rabbits aren't good at adding, but great at multiplication. Hopefully that one goes over the kids' heads, but my adolescent self stifled a chortle of appreciation.Ignoring the ham-fistedness of the film's message, Zootopia is a raucous, gleeful little film that trumpets Disney's return to form with startling certainty.And please ignore my clickbait title.",8,2,5,7 September 2016
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Inconsequential awesomeness
","Although I haven't yet ceased obsessing about Mad Max: Fury Road, I have little patience for action films. As a late teen, and one raised on violence, cartoons, and the Internet, my desensitization was quick and irreversible. As a result -- despite requiring some time to form a capacity for unfettered critical thought -- I eventually realized that I find action films simply unbearable. Of course, every once in awhile I am proved wrong by action films that push the boundaries of my bias, but this is usually if the film in question is either technically brilliant or manages an emotional effect.But there is nothing wrong with inconsequential entertainment, especially if said entertainment does not attempt to pretend that it is more than it is. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is an excellent example of this. It is pure, silly fun, relying on clich√©s and stunts to carry its slipshod plot along to a satisfying conclusion. While this of course isn't what one would expect to be a 'good film', I think that the film's ability to deliver on the expected while exercising effective creative restraint - never overstepping the limits of its genre - is worthy of appraisal.I didn't know that Prince of Persia was an adaptation of a video game until I after I saw the film. As such, I'm sure that my expectations were higher than those of critics, and I find that low expectations often result in poor experiences. But it does at first feel like a video game, complete with fighting, running, simple problem solving, and excessively smooth and mobile camera-work.However, the film leaves its video game visuals behind by the end of the first action scene, opting for a more conventional action style (with a few neat visual tricks). Although the plot is simple and goofy, and the acting even more so, the action scenes are relatively smooth and enjoyable. There is one scene - involving snakes - that is almost too good to be true, and another involving the craziest knife-toss of all time that left me grinning like a goon for the remainder of the film. I don't care if what I saw came from a video game, because as a teenager, I can say with absolute certainty that it's FREAKING AWESOME.As bad as this film is, it is satisfying and fun, and that is really what action films should try to be.",7,2,2,30 January 2016
Spotlight," Spotlight is the best film of the year (and an excellent film too!)
","Although it pains me to say this, I suppose that it is the truth, and therefore, cannot be brushed off as inconsequential: Spotlight is the best film that I have seen this year. I say this with some regret, because prior to having seen this film, I was convinced that no film could surpass the quality of Mad Max: Fury Road, and much of the films deemed as 'Oscar bait' were little more than senseless, boring, over-acted, and rudely political dramas.Ah well. Apparently politics has its place.Spotlight is All the President's Men for my generation, in that it takes pity on our decrepit attention span and limited intellectual capacity, opting instead for a slower, less spastic narrative that successfully engages our minds without leaving us choking on its dust. If anything, it's a much better film than Pakula's classic, because it takes Redford and Hoffman's breakneck sleuthing, and intersperses it with an unexpected but welcome dose of real and painful human emotion. While Pakula's characters were inconsistent, McCarthys' have satisfying arcs and much more depth. Spotlight is focused and ambitious, and yet, manages to be an emotional experience.Spotlight deals with a rather uncomfortable subject, and to its credit, refuses to water it down with taciturn dialogue and unceremonious character interactions. It is raw, and occasionally explicit (only in the verbal sense), the film conveying the real-life events of the discovery of sexual abuse towards children in the Catholic Church with all the fury that such a story should entail. Mark Ruffalo stars as Mike Rezendes, a reporter working on the 'Spotlight' team at the Boston Globe in 2001. The film follows the same structure as All the President's Men, in that much of its running time is consumed by searching through records, convincing people to testify, and awkward interviews.The one and only thing I didn't like about the film was Mark Ruffalo's performance, which, considering the fact that he was the main character, interfered with my enjoyment of the film. His character seemed to hover precariously between sociopathic and sensitive, making it seem as if Ruffalo felt out of place in his own skin. At times he is passionate, at other times he is unfeelingly ambitious and rude. I suppose that the journalist character has been, to a certain extent, narrowed down to an uninteresting clich√É¬© of ambition and insensitivity. But, to McCarthy's credit, while Rezendes is often rude and tiresome, he has moments of riveting and unsettling emotion, transforming him from an ambitious journalist to an passionate and sensitive individual.Taking into consideration the intellectual effect that the film manages to captivate the audience with, Ruffalo's performance is only a slight restraint. Spotlight is riveting and fun, giving the audience a well-deserved break from sloppy, boring dramas that critics seem to lap up without the slightest consideration as to how good the film actually is. It's a film that is good because it is made with sensitivity and intelligence, rather than a film that succeeds based on a label or on a performance. Taking into consideration the films I have seen, I can say with a certain degree of confidence that Spotlight is the best film of 2015.",8,3,6,13 December 2015
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Highly imaginative, but highly dull.
","Hellboy 2 is an exercise in sheer visual imagination at the expense of depth, emotion and pacing. I mean, in what other film would the main character, a crimson devil who files down his horns to look more human, blow up the head of a nature god with a massive revolver and watch as the nature god's green blood turns everything into a natural paradise? I would hazard to say very few. That's really where the film succeeds. Each monster and set piece in this film is crafted with meticulous innovation and creativity, Del Toro putting a generous dose of creator's love into his work. However, his narrative, while also imaginative, relies too much on clich√©s and his characters are listless and tiresome. If Del Toro put the same love and innovation he put into crafting the visuals into shaping his characters and his narrative, Hellboy 2 would have been a fine film indeed. But as it stands, Hellboy 2: The Golden Army is limp and forgettable, buoyed by little more than few surprising twists and a stunning visual arsenal.Hellboy (Ron Perlman) is a reluctant government agent who arrived from another world. He loves cats, television, and his wife, Liz (Selma Blair), but is discontent with his sheltered and secretive existence in the basement of some government facility in the middle of nowhere. He wants, as the saying goes, 'to fit in'. But of course, considering the fact that he happens to be a crimson devil, complete with horns and tail, that isn't going to happen. I did like Perlman's performance. Hellboy is a beer-drinking, gun-toting badass with a surprising outlook on life. He's an irresistible character, if a tad shallow and impulsive. But the other characters are significantly less so. Both love interests in the film are extremely boring, Del Toro seeing it fit to give them the most clich√©d and hackneyed lines in the book. The villain is ridiculous, and the other characters simply aren't there enough.The narrative is innovative, but lacks depth and even entertainment value, relying on strange action scenes (most of which lack fluidity) while barely ever giving us a break. I suppose that that could be taken as a pro, but I'm going to put it down as a con, simply because the running time is too short to have all that action without sufficient emotion or character development. I mean, if they could squeeze the character development and emotion into the action, I would have been happy.Hellboy 2 is basically this: Years ago, humans massacred elves, and now, one of them is deciding to bite back by reawakening the 'Golden Army', which is literally a massive army of golden cyborgs hidden underground.Sadly, much of the film is forgettable, excluding some neat set pieces and a few solid action moments. But even the action scenes lack fluidity and movement, opting instead for a slow, blow-for-blow which lasts usually about five to ten minutes, making them rather plodding and unspectacular. Some of them are simply senseless, and some of them focus on Hellboy way too much.What I wanted from this film was del Toro to put the same love he did into making his characters into shaping his characters. There is tension, yes, but the tension is often laughably clich√©d. The characters develop in tiresome, by-the-book ways. It becomes difficult to care for anybody excluding Hellboy.Creativity alone is enough to designate this film as a good film, as creativity is so often lacking in modern blockbusters. However, this film falls short past the realm of visual creativity, creating a story that is poorly paced and executed, characters that are for the most part tiresome, and action scenes that lack motion. All in all, Hellboy is a fine visual piece, but rather a dull film.",6,1,2,22 November 2015
Interstellar," Interstellar? More like insipid.
","2001, anyone? That brilliant piece of filmmaking that challenged us to do something that mainstream Hollywood has long since shelved: Think. Use your wonderful brains, people! Remember that films don't have to be simply a means to an end; they can push past our own intellectual limitations, establish beautifully thought-provoking horizons just beyond our reach, and best of all, can be memorable not for what they say, but for what they do. It physically pains me to see promising filmmakers with the appropriate intellectual boundlessness to follow in Kubrick's footsteps pushed to the side in favour of bland individuals with little more than visuals and violence in their creative arsenal. Admittedly, I enjoy my CGI extravaganzas as much as the next guy, and that is why Interstellar is a six-and-a-half-star film in my book. As far as visuals go, it's really, well, stellar. But it is simply too unsatisfying and draws too many parallels with 2001 (without delivering on them) to be considered as anything more.Here's the rundown: Earth is dying. Sandstorms are consuming the world (Mad Max prequel?). Humanity is losing hope. It's all very bleak, but concepts often are. In fact, as far as original settings go, it's rather stirring. The settings in most pre-apocalyptic films are already basically destroyed, but in Interstellar, the bleak atmosphere of impending destruction is done rather well. It invoked within me a surprisingly genuine lack of hope. But this is mostly owing to the fact that this segment of the film was shot in rural Alberta, which is pretty close to where I live, so I was able to recognize the deterioration of the landscape, having been there many times in my childhood.Matthew Mcconaughey stars as Cooper, a retired pilot working on the farm with his son, daughter, and dad. I've always found Mcconaughey's performances to be rather cloying, since the first film I saw him in was Mud and he fit so perfectly into the role that I can't exactly see him doing anything else. Coop's daughter, Murph, finds extraterrestrial messages that send them off to the secret NASA headquarters, which are surprisingly close to their house. Coop meets the head of NASA (Michael Caine) and his daughter (Anne Hathaway). He is then offered the opportunity to leave Earth to find a new home for humanity, which he reluctantly accepts (to the selfish ire of Murph).When the space scenes are actually in space (Saturn, the wormhole, and the black hole), they are undeniably breathtaking. There is a particularly beautiful shot in which the spaceship, little more than a speck in the distance, silently glides past Saturn, kindling a sense of the emptiness, loneliness, and most importantly, sheer vastness of space. But once we step inside the ship, the story and narrative begin to lose their momentum as the actors discuss love, nature, and all sorts of misguided ideas with all the intelligence of, well, actors. The scientific discussions are sort of engaging, but the film would have succeeded just as well had science been left undisturbed.Since we're on the topic of science, let me say this: I don't understand why people revel in Interstellar's scientific accuracy. Films are not textbooks, and if you think they are, you'd probably be better off reading a textbook. You might as well go after The Matrix for being an affront to the laws of physics. And the science in Interstellar is basic stuff. It's thin, easily understood, and easily applied. Notice 2001 had no science. There were no explanations, scientific discussions, nothing. But the question remains: did we need them? Of course not.Anyway, back to Interstellar. After they go through the wormhole (which was put there by unknown sentient beings), they arrive at a solar system orbiting a black hole which has three promising planets. Black holes mess with time, and that concept is played with rather effectively, except for the fact that it turns Murph into an annoyed, peevish Jessica Chastain who takes up too much screen time.And then one of the single most viscous and ridiculous monologues about love takes place. It would have been fine, had Nolan realized that love and science don't mix, and when they do, it just sounds ridiculous. But it happens, and its saccharine sentimentality induces cringes of a ridiculous magnitude. Your reaction to this scene (and perhaps the whole film) is a testimony to your cynicism. Needless to say, this scene made me feel like dung, and when Matt Damon's character sees it fit to do the same thing, I felt even worse. The script is long-winded and pretentious, saying too much when saying less would have a greater effect.However, the docking scene is excellent, a visual marvel among visual marvels, a raucous nod to 2001 that forcefully pushes past Kubrick's weightless spaceship ballet into something that is stunningly intense, but stunningly serene as well.Interstellar's climax is extremely disappointing, a strange mix-up between 2001 and Deus Ex Machina that has the audacity to present itself as profound. Given the buildup of the hopeless 'no escape' feeling generated by the first bit of the film, the ending is a blatant narrative cop-out that was hastily strung in when the Nolans realized that they already had way too many pages and had to figure out a way to end it, and fast. Which they do, and the audience is greatly the worse for it.Interstellar is a film trapped by the impossibility of its own concept to find itself at a happy ending, its blandly scripted and acted characters, and its desire to be something more, without having the intellectual horsepower and narrative creativity to do so. Perhaps if Interstellar slimmed itself down by discarding its plot, characters, and dialogue, it could have been a fantastic theoretical documentary that swept us into a stunning unknown.",5,1,2,25 October 2015
Ant-Man," Ant Man's likable performances and visual ingenuity are hampered by limp direction and overall predictability
","Ant Man is standard comic-book fare. It unfolds in an ordinary manner and pace, each scene focused on narrative reeking of scenes we have seen fifty times before. The hero, a good man who happens to be a societal outcast, is given the chance of a lifetime when he is given a superpower. Being the honourable man he is, he uses this superpower for the good of the world, by preventing humanity from descending into chaos and/or destruction as a result of the actions of one man who is usually blinded by something or other, be it greed, jealousy, or insanity. Along the way, he gets to know (and gets super close to) the hot girl, who has problems of her own. Then he challenges the villain, and manages to escape relatively unscathed for the next battle, in which the villain targets something or someone very close to the hero's heart. The hero shows up, battles the villain and eventually blows him up at the cost of what seems to be his own life. However, he lives, makes out with the hot girl, is accepted by society, and cue credits.Although I've seen this formula played out on the silver screen countless times, I still came out of the theatre feeling as though I saw something worth seeing. Not because Ant Man's plot was at all engaging, but rather that it had a fine cast of likable characters, novel visuals, and a strangely metaphysical climax scene.Ant Man stars Paul Rudd as Scott Lang, an ex-con recently out of prison who is estranged from his daughter, living with three other hilarious criminals who spend their days attempting to pull Lang into one get-rich-quick scheme or another. Meanwhile, scientist Hank Pym is realizing that the world as we know it as pretty much about to end. Coincidentally, he also happens to be estranged from his daughter. Pym recruits Lang to go and save the world. Lang agrees. Clich√©d training scenes and character development. Random misplaced action scene. And so on and so forth into boring, predictable, comic book oblivion...Paul Rudd is funny and likable, and the strange ensemble of characters (including a random Avenger) follow Rudd's lead in giving the film a charming atmosphere, reminiscent of Guardians of the Galaxy (which I believe is the undeniably best Marvel movie to date).The visuals of this film are undeniably intriguing, the whole concept of a man who can shrink coming off as entirely novel. Massive bullets fly over Lang's head, trickles of water seem like tsunamis, and ants become, well, man sized. This whole new way of looking at things, however, is hampered by Peyton Reed's limp direction and a predictable plot. The visual novelty comes as a given, never exploited to its full atmospheric potential until the climax scene, which I have to admit was powerfully metaphysical for a superhero movie.Apparently Hollywood has decided to trade in its magic for lukewarm critical appraisal. So if you go to Ant Man expecting to be blown away by the narrative, you'd better lower your expectations quick because Ant Man comes straight out of the ill-used can of formulaic superhero movies, and mildewy at that. But if you go to it expecting to be charmed by the characters and the strange visual novelty, you'll have a good time.",6,0,7,22 July 2015
Justice League," Justice League? Yeah, sorta
","There's a scene in the first thirty minutes or so of Justice League where the film's villain, Steppenwolf, attacks Themyscira to retrieve one of three Motherboxes. He pops out of a blue cylinder and, along with a squadron of Parademons, lays waste to the Amazons as they struggle unsuccessfully to keep the box away from him. Man oh man, was that a great scene. It's intense, colourful, and truly harrowing. Snyder (or whoever directed that scene) instils the scene with such a wonderful sense of movement and terror as the Amazons desperately try and keep the box away from Steppenwolf, dying heroic deaths as the axe-wielding giant swats them down left, right, and centre like a swarm of flies. It's awesome stuff, neither exploitative nor particularly restrained. Sure, Steppenwolf looks like he went through too many CGI blenders and sounds like a petulant brat, but he cuts a truly menacing figure as he brings his fiery axe down on the heads of fleeing Amazons with about as much care as a cheese grater.While the rest of the movie doesn't even come remotely close to the quality of this scene, it isn't a bad film. Not by any means.The first half of the film is especially good. The opening shot, one of those awkward shot-with-phone-and-badly-acted things, admittedly made me cringe at first, but it ends with a child asking Superman what he likes best about Earth, to which he looks away, a dreamy little smile brightening his chiselled features. It's surprising how much depth of feeling a simple smile provides.The rest of the first half, excluding the scene with the Amazons, is mostly forgettable, but I don't recall feeling bored at any point. The banter, especially between Aquaman and Batman, was truly fun to watch, and the action scenes, which could have used a little tightening up, were entertaining enough to hold my interest.Of course, one can't discuss the film without acknowledging the fact that it was a bad idea. Marvel did it right: releasing single films highlighting individual characters, crafting them as human beings before (heheh) assembling them. Warner Bros, in its apparent rush to compete with Marvel, made the mistake of bringing the ensemble together without introducing them all individually, the result being a rushed, muddled mess of exposition and characterisation that ends up unsuccessful, both as a narrative and at the box office. Wonder Woman was successful, and I'm almost certain that a Flash or Aquaman movie would be too. Speaking of which, Aquaman is especially glossed over, although he does get the most badass bit in the whole movie (ICKY THUMP SITTING DUNRK Something WAGON MEXICOOOOOOO DUH DUH).BIG SPOILERS FROM HERE OK BUT NOT REALLY BECAUSE EVERYONE TOTALLY KNEW THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN:Superman comes back. Come on, who thought that was a good idea? We already have a crowded canvas as it is, now we have to sort through Superman's internal post-resurrection struggle. And to top it all off, Superman is just as invincible as he always was, showing up at the final battle and laying waste about as easily as he'd squat and push out a log. The final battle itself is not so great. There are awesome bits, but most of it is a confused, poorly edited mess. There's no sense of arrival, characters popping in and out of the canvas without any visual aids to help us keep track of where everyone is.Like I said, not a terrible film. It has a great scene, a few good ones, and not enough bad ones to overwhelm the good ones. I just wish they approached it differently (or not at all), tightened up the editing, and for the love of God, made it an hour longer.I don't think critics are paid off. But I do think that Rotten Tomatoes has damaged film criticism in that it has provided film critics with a way to tap into the collective mind of their peers. It's difficult to go up against public opinion, especially considering that your job may be on the line. I'm not saying that you switch your litmus test to IMDb's score, because that's bloated beyond reason by the sheer number of fools, trolls, and fanboys plaguing every corner of the Internet; instead, I'm adopting the mantra of the trolls infesting the comment section on Rotten Tomatoes' Facebook posts: Think for your goddam self. Or stop going to the movies and eat ice cream. I don't care.",6,0,5,26 November 2017
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Painfully inconsistent, the Fellowship fails only a little after it begins
","Although I was completely enraptured by the first hour of Peter Jackson's adaptation of the first installment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, after Aragorn takes down seven Nazguls singlehandedly, I felt myself falling into boredom. The reason was simple. By showing that the Nazguls were as weak so as to be easily dispatched by one man wielding a sword and a torch, the threat posed to the Hobbits had been suddenly rendered inconsequential. Gone was the thrilling sense of dread, the terrifying feeling that a powerful, evil force was hunting them. They had become little more than creepy guys in masks.Before that sequence, the film is exceedingly well-done, despite being filmed in a rushed fashion which, while reducing its already overextended running time, gives the film an amateurish quality that it could do without. The opening scene is awesome, and the subsequent scene in which we are introduced to Frodo, Gandalf, and Bilbo is beyond charming. Much of it feels as if Jackson has captured my personal recollections of Tolkien's masterwork: Epic battles, strange creatures, wizards, and names that roll off one's tongue like mini symphonies.Leading up to Aragorn wiping the floor with the Nazguls, they are quite well done. 'Baggins, Shire¬Ö' is one of the coolest, creepiest things I've heard in quite a while, and their random evil acts, while at times hilariously cheesy, serve to establish them as truly formidable opponents. They are perfect embodiments of evil: unyielding, dark, and cruel, clothed in black armor and hoods, riding pitch black horses with red pupils. I was reminded of The Headless Horseman from Sleepy Hollow whenever they graced the screen with their sinister presence.The casting is excellent. Wood plays the faithful and determined Hobbit Frodo Baggins, whose innocence protects him from the powers of the Ring. Ian Mckellen plays the wizard Gandalf, and Viggo Mortenson plays Aragorn. They are acted quite well, rendering themselves true inhabitants of Middle-Earth better than most actors could have done.After Aragorn kicks some Nazgul butt, the threat dissipates along with much of the original novelty of the visuals and characters. The Fellowship is formed, and runs endlessly from place to place. Some shots are nice, while others feel like someone's demented cosplay home video. Even the battle scenes are disjointed and incoherent, jumping aimlessly from character to character as they each take on dozens of orcs singlehandedly (or occasionally with a little help). The appearance of the Balrog and the ensuing chase is very fun, but Gandalf's 'You shall not pass!' is so badly directed that I almost retched.The film is a jumble of inconsistency, bounding from excellent sequences and joyful character interactions to unabashed slogs, frantic nastiness, and pure cheesiness. It is well-endowed in the imaginative department, but can't seem to get a firm hold on anything else.",6,0,0,7 February 2016
The Revenant," Revenge is a dish best served cold, wet, and bloody
","The first bit of this review is spoiler-free. I'll let you know when the spoilers start, so for all you die-hard cinephiles who have managed to stay off Wikipedia for as long as you have, don't worry -- I have your interests at heart.The Revenant cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki opted to film only in natural light, often leaving the crew with only 90 minutes of specific light to shoot long, arduous scenes. While this proved to be a difficult policy to maintain, it really shows on the big-screen, the natural light complementing the intricate juxtaposition between beauty and brutality that Lubezki and I√±√°rritu so meticulously maintain throughout the film. As a Canadian, and one blessed to live so near to the Rocky Mountains, I see many a shot that is vaguely recognizable, from the frozen lake with snow-capped peaks in the distance to the mountains silhouetted against the Northern Lights. Lubezki revels in the natural beauty of unspoiled wilderness -- as he should.But what The Revenant taught me is that beauty is desensitizing, especially if one is inundated with it in a repetitive and unrelenting manner, eventually taking on a (beautiful) monotony. Each scene is done in exactly the same manner: 1. Beautiful nature shot for approximately ten seconds 2. Setting shot 3.Tracking shotsWhile this strategy is at first riveting, its repetition becomes all too clear after about the first hour or so. I was left in a dull state of certainty as to what was to happen next, amplified by the film's predictable narrative and false profundity.Now, that isn't to say that the Revenant doesn't initially succeed. The first hour or so of the film is more transporting and disturbing than any CGI-infused blockbuster. Up to the midway point of the film, I was ready to proclaim it the best film of the year. Despite Dicaprio's lack of a need to act (he mostly just crawls around and screams), he crawls and screams quite well. If that's what the Academy is looking for, I'd say for sure, give him the Oscar that he's supposedly been deserving of for so many years. But acting in general is not something I am prone to appreciate, as I find that the best actors/actresses only succeed when the audience doesn't see them as an actor/actress.I LOVE gritty filmmaking, and The Revenant is as gritty as it gets. We see Dicaprio getting rained on, beaten to a pulp, soaking wet, falling off cliffs, crawling around with a broken leg, dirty, ragged, you name it. The environment that the film depicts is harsh, I√±√°rritu refusing to compromise his wonderfully maintained atmosphere of mud, blood, and water for the sake of the audience, and we are so much the better for it. Sure, it's tough to watch, but it's not so much imposing as demanding. [*SPOILERS FROM HERE*] The Revenant becomes extremely predictable after the first hour. Dicaprio gets mauled by a bear (the scene is brutal), and left for dead by John Fitzgerald (Hardy), who kills his son right in front of him. It's undeniably disturbing stuff, especially when I√±√°rritu decides to throw in some gore to spice things up. Dicaprio then finds his dead son, and then the film segues into a tiresome, revenge flick that echoes man's immaturity while attempting to demonstrate some sort of profound knowledge of the human condition. In truth, The Revenant is as emotionally corrupt as its characters. By the end of the film, Dicaprio has come such a long way, seen so much, and yet, he is the exact same man that he is before.I hate to quote Shakespeare, but 'the rarer action is in virtue than in vengeance', and this film fails to realize that. And yet, it sees fit to assume a certain undeserved intelligence (through the use of symbols and flashbacks).Technically, the film is a masterpiece despite its repetition. Narratively, the film has a flawless beginning and a solid ending. Thematically and intellectually, the film is a mess.",7,7,13,10 January 2016
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," The Black Sheep of the Franchise
","The first time I watched this film, I was bored out of my skull. I left the film with the impression that it was the most pointless film in the franchise. Granted, I was eleven years old. But even as I matured and provided the franchise with a ridiculous amount of day-long marathons, I always skipped over this film, thinking that I was avoiding a useless addition to the series that was universally disliked for its meandering slowness. But recently, I gave it an honest effort, and boy, was I surprised. As a summer blockbuster, it falls flat on its face. But as a brooding and powerful film that depicts the characters that I know and love being forced to mature in the real world, it excels beyond any other of the films in the franchise.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 begins with Harry, Ron, and Hermione preparing to hunt Voldemort's Horcruxes, or pieces of his soul, in order to finally defeat him. But they are forced to undertake this task on their own. Dumbledore, having died, is no longer there to guide their quest. Thus, the trio now faces their most difficult challenge yet. They have barely anything to go off of in the search, and don't even have a weapon with which they can kill the Horcruxes.They are forced to wander the land aimlessly, slowly piecing things together, dodging Snatchers and spending many a day trekking across vast landscapes wonderfully captured with stunning cinematography. Even the action scenes, which are very sparse in this film, are subtly spectacular, director David Yates taking an often minimalistic, yet effective approach to every frantic shot. The scene in which the trio runs away from the Snatchers is definitely one of my favourite scenes in the whole franchise.But it is in this film that we see these characters as actual human beings, capable of sadness, anger, and loneliness. Harry, Ron, and Hermione all have their little bouts with each other as their emerging personalities clash. Ron is no longer the comic relief. He becomes the one who actually has something to lose. Harry is no longer the proud little boy. He is driven by the guilt he feels towards his mistakes and perhaps even his existence. Hermione is no longer the nerdy little girl. She becomes instead the lonely woman, attempting to keep her friends together after removing herself from her own family. This added depth of humanity is what drives the film, much unlike the previous films which were driven by action and an overall sense of wonder. It is surprisingly mature coming from a franchise about witchcraft and wizardry.This film understands its roots, and pays them tribute by adding humanity to them. In the first scene of the film, Harry waits in Number Four, Privet Drive for Order of the Phoenix to arrive. As he walks through the empty house, he expresses a certain fondness for it, despite the hardships that he endured there. In a way, he forgives it.",8,0,2,2 August 2015
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Mission Forgettable
","During one scene of the film, in which the female character offers to run away with Tom Cruise to escape their respective predicaments, I realized that the director had all his action movie clich√©s down pat, but understood them to such an extent that he tried, in a rather pretentious manner, to free them from their status as clich√©s. The result? Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation is a direct cut-and-paste collage of the best elements of its predecessors, mashed together with a senseless plot and lazy attempts at human interaction. It exploits its serial niche of spectacular, death-defying stunts, while avoiding its seemingly constant and inescapable lack of humanity.At the beginning of the film, the IMF is disbanded, and our good friend from Ghost Protocol, Agent Brandt (Jeremy Renner), is ordered to call the IMF's field agents in so they can take desk jobs at the CIA. Meanwhile, our hero, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise (who else?)), is busy fighting a one-man war against an elusive organization known as the Syndicate. He decides not to check in because he was personally insulted by a guy with glasses, captured by the Syndicate, and introduced to a good looking woman who helped him escape. He instead decides to hunt down the Syndicate, and is subsequently labelled as a rogue agent by the CIA. As far as concepts go, it ain't bad. But it feels too familiar. The concept of the invincible fugitive running from the law in a self-righteous pursuit of justice has been replicated so many times in so many different ways that the plot finds itself in a desperate cavern of clich√©d emptiness. Sadly it attempts to fill in this emptiness with the use of even more clich√©s, including the femme fatale, the bomb-strapped-to-chest discussion, the impossible heist, the running around from city to city, the ridiculously strong German brute, and endless shots of men getting out of cars. But in its defense, narrative creativity has dissipated from Hollywood's action films, replaced instead by stunts and crazy violence.The stunts are spectacular. I can't deny that. From the first minutes of the film, in which Tom Cruise holds onto to a plane door as it takes off, to a positively riveting scene where Tom Cruise pulls off an underwater heist, the action is so cool that it alone makes the film worth watching. It is wonderfully choreographed, set to a racing soundtrack, and truly intense. But when the action is turned down to allow the characters to interact, the dialogue is fraught with limp conversation fillers and terrible 'can I trust you?' discussions in mansions and dilapidated rooms. As a result, the characters remain cocky, boring, and pretty much invincible. Even the usually likable Tom Cruise takes on a pretentious, self-righteous faith in his own amazingness. Just once, I wanted to see Ethan Hunt express the vulnerability that he did in the first scene of Mission Impossible 3. Just once, I wanted to see him emotionally mature. But naw, he's way too busy kicking everyone's butt from Morocco to London to address his own faults. Even his relationship with the femme fatale is underdeveloped and boring, as if he barely recognizes her as more than another wrench (I said wrench) that will allow him to dismantle the Syndicate. How can you sympathize with a one-dimensional character who is so wrapped up in his own pride that he puts his blind followers in the path of danger so he can have the last laugh against a guy he barely knows? Well, the simple answer is that you can't.Movies are supposed to make you feel something. Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation does not. Thus, it is a triumph in the area of action and stunt work, but little more than that.",6,4,10,1 August 2015
Dunkirk," Visually stunning, but emotionally unsatisfying
","At the risk of sounding like a fanatic, Christopher Nolan is undoubtedly the only one we can trust to save original, franchise- less cinema from extinction. His willingness to create wholly original spectacle, mayhem grounded in reality, crafted with skill, sensitivity, and a deep, but mellow Tarantino-esque affection for the freedom of the silver screen renders him the most admirable big- budget blockbuster director working today.Which is why it's such a goddam shame that his biggest films aren't that great.Dunkirk recounts the story of the Dunkirk evacuation, probably the most celebrated event of the entire second World War. Hundreds of thousands of British soldiers found themselves pushed back by German forces to the beaches of Dunkirk, so close to Britain that they could see it. Stranded between hell and high water, the British soldiers seemingly had no choice but to wait for the Nazis to pick them off, one by one. In desperation, the British military commandeered everything that could float, from fishing boats to pleasure yachts. And with these small boats, around three hundred thousand British soldiers were saved, at least until they returned to battle. It remains an impressive story even now, not as a military victory, but as a wonderful example of human action, much like the Berlin Airlift of 1948. It can't exactly be labelled as a humanitarian effort, but the fact that so many lives were saved makes it very tempting.The film tells this story through a tense narrative divided in three: land, sea, and sky. One narrative follows a young British soldier as he attempts to escape the beach, another follows one civilian's attempt to help evacuate, and the third follows an air force pilot as he battles the German airforce above the waves. While this division of narrative allows for more of a story to be told, it ultimately reduces the effect of the film. We are told all three stories at the same time, Nolan cutting from one to the other in a choppy manner, not giving any one story the opportunity to form any sort of emotional resonance or any one character enough screen time for us to develop sympathy for them. The result is a curiously thin experience, curious because each story is rousing enough, but together and at the same time, they become weak. While Interstellar wallowed in maudlin nonsense, Dunkirk finds itself on the opposite side of the spectrum: virtually devoid of feeling.All that being said, the film is nothing to sneer at. The plane scenes, while occasionally disorienting, are very thrilling, Hoytema more than pulling his weight in that department. The soundtrack, which ticks like a time bomb throughout the entire film, provides the film with a wonderful intensity that kept me engaged and excited. And whatever fears you may have about this PG-13 war film not accurately depicting war in all its horror and brutality, let them rest. Nolan doesn't shy away from the peril of the circumstances, one particularly frightening scene of soldiers burning to death in the middle of the ocean making this clear. However much Nolan was wooed away from the human side of storytelling by the technical aspect of the entire thing, it's always fun -- and terrifying -- to see a great director at work.As far as acting goes, Hardy and Murphy perform as expected. But of all people, Harry Styles brings it to the table with surprising gusto, outperforming veteran thespians like Branagh and almost even Rylance. It's worth noting that he has no formal training as an actor. However, the drawback of his performance is that he emerges as the only truly compelling character in the entire film. Everyone else, perhaps excluding Murphy's character, is boring, existing as only a ragdoll for all the spectacle and fury to toss about.Dunkirk isn't a bad film. It's a good, maybe even a great film, turned into somewhat of a mess by non-linearity. There are rousing bits, moments of peril, and a few that are undeniably beautiful. Watching the film and taking into account certain strokes of creative genius, you'll know that you're in the hands of a great director.However, you're not in the hands of a great writer, and that perhaps makes all the difference.",6,5,10,23 July 2017
Inside Out," Pixar goes for plastic
","Flaws notwithstanding, Inside Out is a capitalist's perverse dream come true -- however his dream manifests outside of his subconscious is commendable within itself. It's a highly-anticipated film put out by the biggest animation studio in the world, packed with enough goofy jokes to satisfy children and enough reliably maudlin manipulation in the form of homogenized adolescence to please adults. The concept explodes with novelty and the animation is brilliant. And best of all, its main characters all come in fuzzy, furry, huggable forms that will no doubt sell mountains upon mountains of stuffed animals and other such material detritus until the faces of Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust, and Fear are plastered by fingerpaint-stained hands onto the pages of the haplessly constructed book of icons and dank memes ('o sh_t waddup').Inside Out is blatantly artificial. The film is mired in concept and marketability, sacrificing a solid narrative - which Pixar usually promises - as a result.",4,18,47,25 July 2016
Avengers: Endgame," Endgame closes off a decade of storytelling in suitably epic fashion
","Avengers: Endgame, the culmination of eleven years of storytelling spanning twenty-two movies, represents a very peculiar time in the history of film. It is at once an incredibly ambitious project and the product of twenty-two mostly reasonable, inoffensive films made to appeal to the broadest audience possible. It is a celebration of something I'm not sure should be celebrated, the concentration of the box office and blockbuster culture at the expense of artistry, done so by an aggressive corporation that conquers more and more of Hollywood's creative landscape each day.And it's absolutely magnificent.Endgame is the sequel to last year's Infinity War, an average movie elevated by a truly shocking ending. For the first time, we went into our twice-a-year dose of Marvel movie expecting the expected victory and were greeted with bitter defeat. Our heroes had been tossed aside, their ideals shattered and in many cases lives ended, all to give this purple raisin man a happy ending complete with a farm and an infuriating little grin. It was incredible because it was unexpected, and unexpected not because it wasn't a possibility, but within the Marvel Cinematic Universe the concept of the unexpected seemed as foreign to their writers as original storytelling.To say I dislike the Marvel Cinematic Universe would be an overstatement. I have seen all twenty-two of its installments, and while liking only a few of them, there have been fewer still that I've actively disliked. For the most part, they've been perfectly reasonable ways to spend a couple hours on a Saturday afternoon, undercut by low stakes and the inevitable joke that follows every dramatic moment.But although Endgame is a part of this franchise, its storytelling feels decidedly different. Where the MCU is comical, Endgame is dramatic. Where the MCU is superficial, Endgame is expansive and thorough. Where the MCU is formulaic, Endgame is unpredictable. Where the MCU is cynical, Endgame is emotional. And where the MCU is always building to a conclusion that it seems will never come, Endgame is that conclusion. Of course, this isn't to say it doesn't retain some elements of what's made the MCU so popular. The humour and characterization are there, though a little less fleshed out than in previous installments.This relative lack of characterization and humour makes sense given the context of the film. We've already seen twenty other films, which served not only the purpose of building to where we are now but familiarizing us with the characters that populate this story. Understanding it felt rewarding, as if I'd studied for the last ten years and proceeded to do well on the exam, a feeling I'm hardly familiar with. And what characterization there is is generally well thought out, even if the dialogue lacks the snappiness of Whedon's takes on the franchise.But what the film does have is power. Emotional moments take center stage, with more a scene than not delivering a tear-inducing moment, doubtlessly rendering the invested viewer an emotional wreck by the time the credits roll. The Russos very clearly understand that they're delivering the final adventure - at least of this particular saga - and imbue their film with powerful nostalgia enhanced by melancholy and exhilaration in equal measure.This isn't to say Endgame is a masterpiece. The story's logic often threatens to cave down on itself and the film as a whole is somewhat short on action. Thor's arc isn't handled nearly as gracefully as the others, which is a shame because he became one of the more interesting Avengers after Ragnarok and arguably the most after Infinity War. The pacing of individual scenes occasionally feels unnecessarily drawn out, usually to service a limp punch-line that reduces whatever emotion the respective scene was striving towards. The second act feels underdeveloped compared to the first and the third, offering an interesting concept while failing to exploit its thematic potential. But there are moments when all the pieces come together, delivering something it seems only this film can, a soaring, kinetic, exhilarating joy that had my audience applauding and me wanting to. And it's moments like these when Endgame is untouchable.How the hell they follow this up is a question for a new era of actors, storytellers, and the corporation that towers over them all. But I'm going to bet that they don't.As for me, I think I'm finished with superhero movies. That being said, they've been putting smiles on my face and tears in my eyes for almost my entire life, and for that I'm grateful.",8,1,2,29 April 2019
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Grand Budapest: A completely non-vapid exercise in style
","Excluding Uwe Boll, Wes Anderson has likely the most distinct visual style in modern film. His set-pieces brim with colour and detail, yes, but his most obvious stylistic abnormality resides in the presentation of his bijou quirks to the audience. Instead of intensely revealing all that is going on in a scene with a single brutally long tracking shot - a la Inarritu -- Anderson opts instead for the short and sweet, a usually center-framed ground- level shot with a large depth of field that moves only on a rail, pivot, or gratuitous zoom. If it were anyone other than Anderson behind the wheel, the film that adopted this style would surely devolve into monotonous repetition by the ten-minute mark.But then you have something like this:You see, there are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity. Indeed that's what we provide in our own modest, humble, insignificant... oh, f*** it.And that is precisely why I love Wes Anderson. His dialogue, and for that matter, his set-pieces and even the most trivial of details are all imbued with joyous irreverence, narrative glee, and fantastic explosion of shapes and colours that even the most CGI-encrusted extravaganzas couldn't even come close to comparison. At times, his visual style becomes the substance of the film that carries it from scene to scene, never allowing the film to segue into monotony.The plot itself is an afterthought compared to the film's visual euphoria. However, the performances, specifically Fiennes', are not. Fiennes plays M. Gustave, the legendary proprietor of The Grand Budapest Hotel, who is charged with the murder of the woman (Tilda Swinton) who left him a priceless painting, Boy with Apple. Fiennes exploits his character's wide spectrum of comportment -- from surprising eloquence to equally surprising vulgarity -- with meticulous skill, charmingly deadpan in every single line he delivers.The film is a jumble of quirks and lightness until its conclusion. It suddenly takes a sombre tone, ending on a rather heavy note. Anderson is able to pull off this tonal shift by maintaining his unique style throughout, but the ending is effective in itself. It leaves the audience simultaneously satisfied and sad, urging them to think about the implications of what they have just witnessed: a lovely film built around a madcap style that explores the extent of the narrative, the pure act of storytelling itself, and the outer reaches of what we call empathy.",9,1,2,12 June 2016
Big Hero 6," Big Hero 6 was almost a great movie. But no.
","In many aspects, Big Hero 6 is conventional. It follows a linear, action-packed plot with a reasonably likable protagonist and his also reasonably likable friends as they battle a dangerous threat to the world as we know it, smashes the tears out of us with a beautifully animated climax scene, and leaves us feeling emotionally fulfilled. However, Big Hero 6 falls short of its greater predecessors, an acclaimed, almost cultish list that doesn't seem to ever leave us alone with its catchy songs and memorable plots, a list that includes Frozen, Tangled, and Wreck-It Ralph. Its dialogue is clunky, its story is slow and slippery, and it has no catchy songs (I actually hate it when movies have songs so I guess this is a good thing). It feels awkward at times, especially at the beginning, which has the constricting appearance of a plea from parents all across the globe for their children to show an interest in post-secondary education.The film follows Hiro, a young robotics prodigy directing his talents toward the illegal ('But lucrative!') world of bot fighting whose future suddenly brightens when his brother convinces him to go to post-secondary. But, as with every great Disney movie, things fall apart just when they start looking up. Hiro suffers a devastating tragedy, leaving him bereft of any ambition that he once had. He deals with the pain of loss (which is a rather mature theme for a Disney film) with the help of his brother's healthcare robot, Baymax. Baymax, a white, pillowlike robot, is an attempt at making an adorable memorable creature that everyone loves, but he falls slightly short of classic Disney characters, like(the first coming to mind being) Stitch. His lack of 'adorableness' is mostly due to his serious, completely non-robotic, 50-year old man voice. But he has his moments.The villain is great. He is sinister (almost too sinister) and one-sidedly cruel. Although, when the mask comes off, you find yourself sighing at the obviousness of what was under it in the first place.There is no denying it, however. Big Hero 6 is beautifully animated, its action scenes are spectacularly choreographed, and it is easily one of the best animated films of the year.",5,1,9,24 March 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy," As much as Marvel sucks, well, this doesn't.
","Marvel Studios has become an idiocratic cult that has somehow created for itself a cinematic niche which only it can fill and sustain. Year after year, Marvel manages to garner critical acclaim with flimsy, repetitive narratives and tiresome characters, critics and the masses alike revelling in obvious exercises of money-grubbing banality. Age of Ultron, even as a comic book film, was senseless, feeling almost like a remake of its much better (but still poor) predecessor. Ant Man was laughably clich√©d, barely scraping by on its mildly intriguing visual innovation. Fantastic Four was ghastly. And the Avengers are the single most annoying bundle of inconsistent characters that I have ever been unfortunate enough to acquaint myself with. Glancing at the synopses for Marvel's upcoming endeavours, I am struck at how similar they all seem to older Marvel fare; conceptually impaired, overly serious, and all thoroughly atrocious. I often wonder why Marvel is the Hollywood powerhouse that it is, when it seems to dabble only in the realm of glorified TV movies.Then I remember Guardians of the Galaxy.Guardians is the best Star Wars spoof you'll ever see. I might even go so far as to say that it is a better film than Star Wars, but I'm sure that such a sentiment would spark death threats and such, and even thinking about it now, I'd like to take that one back. Guardians may surpass Star Wars in terms of charm and colour, but Star Wars has a better feel for its characters and concludes with nothing less than pure jubilation. Screw you, Death Star! Chris Pratt stars as the ever-lovable, cheerful renegade Peter Quill, who was kidnapped by space aliens when he was nine or so, right after his mother dies in front of him. Brutal stuff. And after we are forced to sit through the Marvel logo, which reminds us that cinema is art only in the sense that capitalism is art, we are transported across the galaxy to a planet with a super funky name. And I mean transported. The film's visuals are really quite stunning, the bleakness of space enlivened with red, orange, green and blue, making it feel like a mystical Tolkien-esque realm rather than, well, space. In fact, the film itself is a mind-blowing celebration of colour and shape, revelling in the capacity of the silver screen to mesmerize an individual out of existence. I'd say in terms of visuals, it epitomizes CGI-based escapism.But this is all an afterthought when acknowledging the film's merits. While the visuals are remarkable, what really intrigued me about the film was its novelty, wit, and wonderful characters. Every character is given depth and self-awareness. I don't recall ever laughing so hard in a Marvel film. And I have to admit, a few scenes brought tears to my eyes.Guardians has heart and soul, and a solid dose of hilarity to boot. And although it may be the first of a billion-dollar franchise, well, I could care less. I don't want to say this, but...agh... urgh... gah......thanks, Marvel.",10,1,6,28 December 2015
Jurassic World," Putrid, soulless, and devastating, Jurassic World is the worst that cinema has to offer
","There is one scene that I believe sums up this hellish, putrid excuse for a film. A woman, with little or no plot significance, is mauled by a pterodactyl. Then, as if that wasn't enough, she is picked up, screaming, by the pterodactyl who lifts her extremely high before dropping her. As she plummets, another pterodactyl catches her and carries her over a small body of water before dropping her. They proceed to drown her, pushing her screaming body back in every time she resurfaces. Then, completing the horrifying mayhem of this three-or- so minute long scene, a massive, sea dwelling creature bursts out of the water, catching the woman and her assailant in its massive jaws. It then wrenches them shut, and falls back into the water.And we, as an audience, should be vomiting at this point.What did the woman do to deserve this? Did she have a moral failing or some sort? Was she evil? No. She was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. And by that, I mean she was in this limp, horrifying 'film' so called Jurassic World. Oops. I meant Jurassic Worst.Jurassic Worst is a nasty, cruel, poor, ninety-fifth rate, shoddy, miserable, careless, amateurish, slow, lousy, crummy, rotten, destructive, delirious, atrocious, unacceptable, execrable, black- hearted, worthless, crooked, dirty, godawful, and entirely unpleasant two hours of canned drama and worthless, repetitive dinosaur rampages. The entire movie, fraught with average performances and dull humour, left me feeling heartbroken at the horrifying waste of time I had unwillingly experienced.Here is the plot summary in a nutshell: Jurassic Worst, a theme park, needs a new attraction. They build a dinosaur that is pretty dangerous. That dinosaur breaks out and wreaks havoc, until it is beaten up by a T. Rex, and subsequently eaten by another dinosaur. Oops. Spoiler.There is nothing visually striking about this film. Much of the visuals are even slightly disappointing. You would expect the park to be a fancy, futuristic place. However, it is rather small, and completely lackluster, despite the occasional holographic dinosaur. In fact, we barely see the park, exposed instead to its even more boring inner workings, which are basically dinosaur pens, a control room, and Chris Pratt's shack.Now we get to the characters. There are two main children in this film, brothers who come to the park to visit their aunt. The younger brother is an annoying know-it-all, constantly spouting facts or running around impatiently, giving him a painful association with a mosquito constantly on the move for a new host. The older brother is a good actor, but his performance is hampered by his character's inconsistency, and his tendency to stare at pretty girls while not saying anything even though he has a girlfriend at home. Their aunt, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, is a nitpicky, red-haired administrator of some sort, who, while striving to the best of her abilities, is extremely boring to watch, her lines being canned and slow. Chris Pratt's inherent charisma sadly comes off as cockiness as he struts around, doing little other than admiring his raptors, fixing cars, and being the great American hero that the script gives him no right to be. All the characters are extremely one- dimensional, showing little change throughout the movie. So even before the action begins, it takes a considerable effort to get into this movie.And then, as it had begun to seem like it never would, the action begins. I hoped that I would be able to sit back and relax, but I constantly found myself either disgusted or sighing at the lifeless attempt at character drama. The film would constantly use the same shot to create intensity. Someone would be hiding behind something, then a massive pair of teeth would come up close to them, and then, the teeth would leave, either for good, or to return two seconds later through a wall. The second time onward, it completely lost its effect. The film was not intense (except for one shot that was pretty solid, but this counts as a small gold nugget in a mountain of trash), and suffered from a severe lack of sense and morality. Crowds of innocent people simply enjoying their day are murdered or beaten up by careless animals, diving in on people in a vile feeding frenzy. And no one seemed to care.It is hard to root for anyone in this film, even Chris Pratt. The kids are either annoying or flaky. Howard runs around in heels for the entire movie. Chris Pratt is cocky. The stereotypical nerd character is self-entitled and careless. The boss of the park is an absolute idiot (he was great in The Lunchbox, though). The bad guys are, well, bad. And the raptors that are supposed to help Chris Pratt are super unstable, sometimes killing people, and sometimes doing what is right. Literally, the only thing in the whole movie that is possible to root for is the T. Rex, who gets barely any screen time.The deaths are ridiculous and indiscriminate, each one more horrifying and immoral than the one that came before. I know that it is more 'realistic' to have everyone die, rather than just the bad people, but Jurassic Worst was not made to be realistic. It's a stupid dinosaur movie, for goodness' sake!Walking out of the theatre, I felt sick and sad. I had wasted two hours watching a limp, soulless massacre, made complete by the torture and murder of an innocent woman. If this is what cinema is going to become, if this is what we flock in droves to see, if this is all I can expect from Hollywood, then I refuse to take part in it.I'm not going to understate it. Jurassic Worst is heartbreakingly awful.",1,23,48,29 June 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Age of Ultron is exciting, action-packed, and emotionally empty
","Comic book films are often clich√©d in their innovativeness. They are all wildly different, but all feel strangely similar, in their clanking, brawny, save-the-world-from-a-terrible-villain cesspools of ideas and characters. The thing that sets a comic book movie apart is usually one scene, be it a scene that depicts beauty, emotion, or simply an unusually awesome use of the all-seeing camera. In Guardians of the Galaxy, we had the scene in which Groot sends a cascade of glowing spores into the air. In The Dark Knight, we had the unforgettable interrogation scene (among many others), where we were exposed to the visceral world of insanity. In Iron Man, we had the 'Tony Stark has a Heart' motif. Without these moments, these comic book movies would be what they advertise themselves to be: Simple, sexist, and action packed to the point of insanity.Age of Ultron is that not-so-rare comic book movie with an intriguing setup, formidable villain, snarky humour, the optional dose of character drama, and women in tight clothing. It is well made and engaging, the camera-work is mostly seamless, the scene where Ultron is introduced is excellent, and there are a lot of fancy explosions. But Age of Ultron falls short of its better predecessors in a few keystone elements.Firstly, it lacks a powerful scene. Most of the scenes are visually commanding, that is true, but there is no scene that makes the film memorable for its grasp of the human condition. There is the occasional goodbye, but these scenes did not inspire any sort of feeling whatsoever. I remained completely unmoved for the duration of the film.Secondly, the final battle scene is not engaged enough. It keeps cutting away from the action to some random talking that no one cares about, not allowing the audience to immerse itself in the action that they paid for. These elements notwithstanding, Age of Ultron is a good escapist film and James Spader's depiction of the robot Ultron is really darn cool.",5,6,15,3 May 2015
2001: A Space Odyssey," 2001: Truly an Odyssey
","2001: A Space Odyssey is no more a film than I a potato. And, while the limits of my physical comprehension prevent me from truly knowing otherwise, I am not a potato. Rather than being a film, 2001 is a thrillingly ambitious visual journey that transcends time and space, bringing forth puzzling, yet provocative ideas of the beauty and horror in mankind's quest to further itself as a species. It is an experience that refuses to spoon-feed its themes, opening the intellectual playing field for multiple interpretations, creating a swarm of controversy and argument as each individual seeks to piece together the subtle and not-so-subtle hints at what in the world 2001 is saying. And if that weren't enough, it is thrilling, beautifully paced, and visually stunning for a film (for lack of a better word) made in the 1960s.2001 begins, rather curiously, at the 'dawn of man'. Men in monkey suits roam the desolate plains of Africa (I assume that it is Africa due to the general consensus that mankind originated in Africa). I must say, that even for men in monkey suits, they were quite convincing as actual monkeys. Hilarious, even. But that's besides the point. The 'dawn of man' sequence is done to show the dawn of human ingenuity, and how this newfound ability to use elements in our environment to our own personal use put us at the top of the evolutionary pyramid. It also suggests at some divine intervention, with the appearance of a large, black, rectangular block that seems to create the ingenuity within humanity.Flash forward many, many years, and mankind has colonized the moon. A doctor of some sort is heading to the moon to retrieve an artifact. A brilliant docking sequence ensues, as spaceships float towards and around each other, provocatively shadowed, while a familiar classical waltz highlights the dance-like quality of the whole scene. It is slightly overextended, I admit, but I suppose that this was done for the benefit of the 60s audience, who had likely seen nothing even close to the likes of this film's visuals before. The doctor lands on the moon, and heads to the artifact, whatever it is. I will not reveal what this artifact is (although I'm sure that pretty much everyone knows), but whatever it is sparks a mission to Jupiter eighteen months later, manned by two men in charge of the maintenance of the ship, a few members of the survey team who are in cryostasis, and the sentient computer HAL 9000, who controls most of the ship. This sequence resorts to a conventional narrative that is significantly faster paced and more atmospheric than the other sections of 2001. What basically happens is this: HAL makes a mistake, and everything goes downhill from there.The thing I liked most about this sequence is the acting. In this day and age, our cinematic characters feel deliberately scripted, while in 2001, the dialogue feels real, complete with 'ums', verbal mistakes, and real emotion. The actors feel like real people, and we are thus able to sympathize with all of them, even including HAL.And then the film ends. And what an ending it is. It is an ending that will fuel controversy for years to come, as it is so frustratingly complicated and ambiguous, that it can be interpreted in any number of ways. Some may toss it off as pretentious (which is valid), while others may devote their waking hours to unceasing analysis. Interstellar, in an obvious attempt to rip-off 2001's shocking ending, took a shot at it, but just ended up drowning in ridiculous pseudoscience. 2001 doesn't pretend to be bound by the realm of science. Its thought-provoking climax, unlike Interstellar's, is a purely transcendental experience that appeals to our imagination as well as our intellect. Although the bit before the final sequence is ridiculously and annoyingly over extended, this is only a small issue compared to the beauty of the final sequence.I loved this movie, because it forced me to think, not just sit and drool. We have become so used to being served up ideas (or passive entertainment) on a platter, that we forget our own intelligence, becoming one with the ideas of the filmmaker rather than creating our own.Although you may condemn Kubrick as a pretentious showman, keep in mind that he can do more with a large, black, rectangular block than most contemporary directors can do with mountains of CGI, and that is what makes him one of the greats. Let me put it this way: If all films were potatoes, 2001 would be a film.",8,2,4,27 September 2015
Elysium," Shaky in more ways than one
","To tell you the truth, I'm still unsure as to why Neill Blomkamp's 2009 film District 9 still haunts me to this day. Perhaps it is the tear-jerking ending, where an emotion so pure, so moving, so poignantly hopeful is expressed to the audience. Perhaps it is its far-reaching and deeply compelling thematic ambition. Or perhaps it is its gratuitous, borderline horrific violence that pounds mercilessly at the senses until the film becomes almost impossible to watch, melting from a thought-provoking premise into an unmitigated, gleeful gorefest. Whichever it is, District 9 is a film that will confuse me forever.Elysium, Blomkamp's second film, is a significant regression from District 9. It is loud, messy, and disorienting, wasting its promising concept and compelling cast on little more than a vehicle for visual splendor and forgettable action scenes. Its characters are poorly created, unexplored, and impossible to sympathize with. Even Matt Damon, who is usually quite good at playing the hero, is given a role that he can't really pull off.This isn't to say that Elysium is entirely horrible, however. The visual imagination that went into this film (while reminiscent of District 9) is often wonderful to behold. There are numerous shots that are stirring (although there are just as many that are repulsive) in their depictions of a strange apocalyptic world that is fraught with injustice, crime, and social division. The concept is interesting enough to entertain, and a few nice touches by the director save the film from being an abysmal mess. But despite this, Elysium is a very poor film.Elysium conjures up a vision of Earth, about 150 years in the future, where the rich have left the planet on a space station called Elysium and party it up while the poor rot on the Earth below. Matt Damon, an ex-criminal, has a job at a factory on Earth where he is exposed to a lethal dose of radiation, and informed that he has five days to live. In desperation, he joins a group to pull of an elaborate 'brain-heist', and steals a bit more than he bargains for. Battles ensue, mercenaries arrive, and Blomkamp's awful shaky-cam direction makes about half of the film impossible to watch.My main issue with this film was cinematography. The action scenes were shot in an unneeded frantic manner that them entirely incoherent and dizzying. Much of the film feels like it was shot with a hand-held camera. I suppose that shaky-cam may appeal to some people, but I hate it. I prefer to actually be able to see the action than bodies flying in and out of the screen, occasionally locked in combat, occasionally bloody as hell. It is rather tiresome to be subjected to such a level of movement without coherence, and for such an extended period of time.I don't understand, Mr. Blomkamp. You have all this money. Why the heck can't you make an action scene that doesn't rely on shaky cam? Another huge issue with this film is its characters, who are either unsatisfying, repulsive, or boring. Matt Damon plays a selfish guy who wants to live at all costs (but is still in love with a childhood friend), who is willing to put all those he cares about at risk just to save his own skin. It's very hard to sympathize with him. The main villain, the sociopathic security chief of Elysium, lacks motivation (as well as the ability to act). Her hatred and wish to preserve the social division is never explored in a satisfying manner. The main mercenary, Kruger, undergoes a random character change for no reason whatsoever, which is very cloying. It's also impossible to understand what he's saying half the time. The other characters are either cannon fodder or there to open doors, making them all rather boring.The story is poorly paced, with the action beginning about an hour into the film's duration (the film is less than two hours long), and stalling at promising points to show some 'very emotional' slo-mo, which never serves any purpose.Elysium is a nauseating disappointment, too serious to fall into the 'so bad its good' territory, and too shaky to even be considered as a solid action film. The CGI is solid, though, and that's all I can really say.",4,0,2,18 October 2015
Pulp Fiction," Pulp Fiction is pulp. Who knew?
","Pulp Fiction is just the sort of film that will change the way that you think, although that remains to be seen whether or not that's a good thing. Ask yourself: would you rather live out your life thinking eloquent, civil thoughts or gleefully profane, borderline blasphemous mental rants (most of which having to do with fast food) that would send Mike Tyson running into a corner with both hands over his ears, screaming 'I can't hear yooooou!!'.Okay, it's not that bad. The f-bomb count, according to the IMDb parents guide, is 272 (with 40 in the maternal form), but unless you're a fat, doe-eyed little boy with one hand on the TV remote and the other on the Bible, you won't be offended.Anyway, I'll stop before this turns into a full blown parent's guide. I mean, if you want a parent's guide, go to the parent's guide.Pulp Fiction reminded me of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (or any of her works, for that matter) in that it prioritizes character exposition rather than narrative. In truth, the narrative -- much like an Austen novel -- is there, yes, but it's not really what we're in for. Rather, we dip into Tarantino's perverted thoughts to see his characters unfold, live, breathe, and die in front of us as they float through a world subject to Tarantino's gleeful aggressions. Tarantino, a master of dialogue (although I'm sure Austen would object), creates and develops such beautifully rich psychological profiles that he allows you to sympathize with even the most depraved of human beings. For me, being highly concerned with values and morals and all other sentimental detritus that modern society condemns, this proved slightly difficult to stomach. For example, in the first scene, we witness two murders. There's a bit of buildup, sure, but you're never quite given the reason why you have to sit through an execution.To his credit, Tarantino makes his depravity an afterthought. The film pulsates with a beautiful energy absent from modern screen writing. And the acting is sublime. Never will I forget Hoffman's slick, cool, and hilariously restrained twist with Uma Thurman, or even good ol' Sam Jackson's 'English motherf- (and you know the rest)', or EVEN Ving Rhames' wise comments on pride. The character's passionately delivered lines brim with quotable dialogue, the real, crazy stuff that sends delightful shivers down your spine.As I previously mentioned, the plot really doesn't matter in this film. Tarantino's use of the nonlinear narrative (which has since become famous) ends up making the order of the story very difficult to follow. In fact, after finishing it, I couldn't for the life of me remember the order of what happened. I knew that some things happened: people talked, did drugs, killed people, got raped, etc, but the order in which all these things happened escaped me. But once you realize who died, who got raped, who talked, and who did drugs, you'll realize that the story is a great deal more complicated than you give it credit for being. Not only did the characters interact, they grew, progressed, and even died. This I loved. It's Pulp Fiction in its purest form, a mess of bullets, blood, and dialogue that is at once unexceptional and utterly unforgettable.",8,1,3,6 March 2016
"McFarland, USA"," A joyful, rewarding experience that will leave you smiling.
","Yes, I know. McFarland is a very, almost exclusively formulaic sports drama. It follows the routine that we have heard echoed in sports dramas long past, of a washed-up coach encouraging a bunch of raggedy kids to embrace their potential, through sweat and determination. But that doesn't mean McFarland is a bad movie. Quite the contrary, in fact. McFarland presents us with a positive outlook on life and humanity, giving us a much needed break from the dark, fantastical worlds of Kingsman and Fifty Shades. McFarland is bright, optimistic, and joyful. That, along with Niki Caro's loving direction and a score of smile-inducing performances makes for a rewarding film experience.McFarland takes place in McFarland (of course), a small town in the United States where most of the residents (mostly Hispanic) pick and package crops, referring to themselves as 'pickers'. Jim White, a gym teacher fired from his position for injuring one of his players arrives in McFarland to work at the local high school, McFarland being the only place where he was able to find work. The residents of the town react with surprise at having a white man and his white family in their midst, but the racial gap quickly dissipates when they grow accustomed to them, and we discover that the residents are a close-knit, welcoming community full of charismatic kids, adults, and just the right amount of drunken parents to create sufficient conflict. Jim White sees the boys' potential as runners, and creates a cross-country team for them, enlisting seven boys, each of which has their own, distinct, lovable personality. They train and run often, occasionally coming into conflict with White, but as the community begins to accept him, they also begin to accept him.White and his family, while being repulsed by the people of the town at first, are caught up in the love everyone has for one another, and consequently fall in love with the town as well. The story is punctuated with minor conflicts, although a few of these seem to exist only to kill time.White begins to develop a fatherly affection for each one of the kids as they come to accept him. Each one is funny and joyful in a distinct way, except for the brooding character of Thomas Valles (he comes around eventually).While the film presents itself as a sports drama, it is truly a tale of social unity and adapting ways of life. White must adapt to the way of life of the residents of McFarland, while they must adapt to his presence. Each party's readiness to do this left me smiling like a goofball. I highly recommend this movie. Skip out on Spongebob and watch this.",9,6,20,4 March 2015
Steve Jobs," Steve Jobs is fantastic. No, not Steve Jobs. The film is fantastic.
","You know you've watched a great film when you come out of it loving someone you've hated for the last decade. In my case, that happens to be Apple's legendary founder and quintessential non-techie tech mogul, Steve Jobs (and to a lesser extent, Seth Rogen, but that's not important). I hated Steve Jobs because I hate Apple and its ridiculous cult following, which I think is still perfectly justified. Apple sells terrible products that seem built to fall apart after a certain amount of time, almost as if every product is built with a detonator set to go off after two years, give or take. They look nice, but lack the processing power and ease of use that makes Windows computers pre-Windows 10 so much superior.(Jarring P.S.: I'm laughing at the fact that I wrote this review before Samsung blew up)Of course, now I'm jaded and curmudgeony (probably due to the ridiculous amount of time I spend on IMDb), so I probably hate Apple for no reason whatsoever.The film, unlike Apple, is awesome. On the surface, it is a complex and intricate character exploration, not just of Jobs, but of those around him as they move forward in life. Digging deeper, it represents wonderfully wholesome cinema, the almost perfect use of two hours of screen time, never lagging or even pausing to catch a breath in a tightly-structured, dialogue-saturated quest to present and explore its titular character. Sorkin's screenplay comes first and foremost in all respects. The narrative is divided into three small-scale sections, an unconventional and interesting little maneuver that makes the film shine with novelty. The dialogue is fantastic, although it does require an effort to keep up, especially if one isn't familiar with the names of Apple execs and staff in the late 80s. In a way, it's very much like All the President's Men in the way it hurtles along, forcing you to listen and think. Sorkin and Boyle don't care if they leave you behind. And trust me, we're much the better for it. The performances are also notable, if slightly less than Sorkin's stunning screenplay. Fassbender completely disappears into the titular role, Winslet delivers flawlessly, and even Rogen pulls his (considerable) weight well beyond expectations. As a film propelled by dialogue rather than visuals, these elements cannot be ignored, but the actors themselves make it impossible to do so. They melt into their characters, creating believable, flawed, and really quite inspiring people.I recommend Steve Jobs on all fronts -- as a character exploration, an intellectual exercise, and most importantly, an excellent film.",9,2,3,15 October 2016
Whiplash," Feverish and Original, Whiplash excels
","Whiplash is an ingenious clash between jazz and psychology, bringing with it a resounding tale of terror, music, and insanity that resolves itself so perfectly, viewers will be truly speechless at the end of the film. The film depicts Andrew Neiman, an ambitious young drumming student at the fictional, yet very prestigious Schaffer Conservatory. A teacher at the school, Terrence Fletcher, finds Andrew and adopts him into his band where he proceeds to harass, verbally as well as physically abuse and push Andrew to his absolute limit. The dynamic of the two characters is riveting: A young, yet highly ambitious (he dumps Melissa Benoist to pursue drumming. I mean, you have to be ambitious to dump Melissa Benoist) student attempting to impress his seemingly unimpressible teacher who pushes and pushes Andrew inevitably to his breaking point. Damien Chazelle crafts Andrew's practice scenes exquisitely, often tuning cuts between shots to drum beats hammered out by the sweaty, bloody, and often exhausted Andrew as he wrenches his face and pounds away (once even punching a hole in snare drum out of sheer frustration) at a dilapidated old drum set. Andrew becomes cold, reckless, and violent in his pursuit of 'greatness' while all this is encouraged by his teacher, pulling him deeper and deeper into an inescapable, sinister, and hopeless rabbit hole.I believe that the only issue with this film is its occasional lack of loyalty to a certain subject. At certain times it seems to jump between the central theme of jazz and the central theme of ambition, creating a sort of cinematic identity crisis. However, this is quite easy to overlook. But still. Watch it for the jazz. Watch it for the excellent performances from Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. Watch it for the unrelenting depiction of human ambition and what it can lead one into. Or watch it for Melissa Benoist.Whiplash is truly an excellent film with a mind-blowingly awesome ending.",7,1,4,20 April 2015
Rango," Rango finds art in its thematic complexity.
","Rango's animation is outright disgusting. Lizards, singing owls, ugly plastic fish, roadkill, rattlesnakes with machine-guns for rattles, rats, weird blobby creatures, and a homeless man compose most of the characters in this film, mashed together in a weird, reptilian Western about a chameleon in an identity crisis.The film begins with the titular character, a blue-skinned, crooked- necked chameleon, contemplating his dramatic life with his 'friends' (the torso of a mannequin, a plastic tree, a dead cockroach, and a wind-up fish). However, a bump in the road sends his aquarium flying out of the back of the car he is in, thrusting him suddenly and unexpectedly into a harsh, unforgiving desert.The film continues from there, meandering around peril, comedic coincidence, and strange hints at an underlying message. It is witty, funny, and action packed, while the slightly crude humour adds a much needed dose of edginess to the genre of 'children's films'. And then, just when I thought the film was about to segue dolefully into a clich√©-ridden redemption fueled finale, it blew my mind with one line:'Who am I?'A moving pause.'I'm nobody.'It was at this moment that I realized that this film is conveying a message, more powerful, more intellectually stimulating than most children's films would ever dare, presenting itself as the spiritual self-discovery of a chameleon. It is truly beautiful, despite the strange presentation, and vile animation.Good children's films these days often focus on the main character's interaction with others. While they often address the personal impacts of certain relationships, they rarely delve into the nature of the individual in and of itself. However, Rango is all about the individual learning to find his place in the world, learning to cope with his own existence. He discovers that his surroundings define who he is and that his choices are based on the duties that he has towards others. He, as the Spirit of the West says, 'cannot walk out on his own story'. Children, as well as adults, need this theme. So much of today's culture is fraught with indecision over one's identity. This film teaches us that we, as individuals, are defined by our circumstance. While our choices do play a significant role, we have a moral duty to be the people we were meant to be, in order to acknowledge our existence as...well, reptiles.Beautiful movie, one of the best animated films cinema has to offer.",10,1,1,29 June 2015
The Conjuring," The Conjuring conjures fear
","The Conjuring manages to be terrifying without being gory, which I suppose could be considered a feat, given the irredeemable amount of bloody body parts we have to put up with in today's horror films. I make it a rule to avoid horror movies in general, not only because I get frightened easily, but because horror films too often sacrifice important narrative and technical elements, including character, emotion, style, and coherence in favour of cheap thrills (often fuelled by gratuitous violence) that serve no purpose other than to keep you up at night, fearing that whatever was in the film is inexplicably standing at the foot of your bed. The Conjuring borders precariously on this edge between a solid film and a pointless, incoherent scarefest. However, a few neat scenes, a thrilling conclusion, and a surprising effectiveness without resorting to gore save it from succumbing to the tropes of its miserably empty genre.The Conjuring revolves around a threatening demonic presence due to numerous deaths on a section of land that once belonged to a witch. A family of seven (five girls) moves into this house. It follows standard haunted-house film structure, as seemingly inconspicuous events (birds flying into the windows, death of the dog, doors creaking, mother waking up with bruises, etc.), eventually lead to more and more terrifying events. The buildup is done quite well, evoking simple fright, each jump scare or sinister occurrence building upon the last. There is one especially terrifying scene where the mother is lured into the cobweb-filled basement, and the most thrillingly simple, yet petrifying happening occurs, demonstrating that she is not alone in the dark, silent basement. I, for one, was scared out of my mind.Eventually, the family is forced to call upon 'demonologists' Ed and Lorraine Warren, who arrive at the house with an assistant and a police officer, setting up a paranormal monitoring network that is very, almost too reminiscent of the one in Poltergeist. Lorraine, who is a clairvoyant, begins to unearth the house's dark secrets, slowly piecing together the puzzle as the supernatural presence becomes more and more threatening, not just to the family, but eventually extending to the Warrens as well, introducing an unexpected, yet highly appreciated risk factor.The Conjuring is fun, if your idea of fun is revelling in gleeful fright. It has enough jump scares (some of which are admittedly awesome) and suspenseful moments to keep your eyes fixed towards the screen, anticipating, yet dreading what is going to happen next. The execution is slick, and the story, while borrowing from other horror films, manages to be unpredictable and fun. The dialogue, however, is quite often lacking in substance, relying on basic verbal clich√©s that occasionally make no sense given the circumstances. There is way too much on random Satanic based information and bits about the power of God. Also, the film has a difficult time establishing the mood, as it bounds haplessly from serenity to dread, often for no reason at all. But what eventually separates the film from other entries in the genre is its thrilling and surprisingly emotional ending, which includes a ridiculously awesome line, and an even more ridiculously awesome monster reveal. And of course, the ambiguous ending. I hate ambiguous endings.But what is extremely irksome about The Conjuring, is its refusal to set rules that make even the slightest bit of sense. We are left in the dark (so to speak) as to the abilities of the ghosts, the intentions of some of the ghosts, and their allegiances are so frantic and unspecified, that it is thoroughly impossible to understand why the heck everything is happening the way it is.For example: Ghosts have telekinesis. Everyone knows that. So why (if the ghost's intention was truly to kill everyone) not use your obvious telekinetic powers to chuck a knife into someone's head WHILE THEY'RE SLEEPING? This is one of many galling plot holes that haunt the film .The Conjuring has to be the most frightening film that I have ever seen, but that does not in and of itself make it a good movie, because it is fraught with plot holes and poor dialogue. What makes it a good film (and saves it from its genre) is its glorious simplicity, its ability to elicit fear without resorting to gore, and its awesome ending.",7,1,2,1 November 2015
Straight Outta Compton," A riveting 'rags-to-riches' story that turns flat out decadent
","If you don't really think about it, Straight Outta Compton, this year's anti-action blockbuster, is the sort of movie that will completely blow you away. Its crisp direction, engaging performances, and snappy tracks seamlessly work together to pull the audience in, whether fans of N.W.A. or simply the casual viewer. This film knows how to grab and hold the audience's attention, inserting humour, drama, violence, and even undiluted emotion at such a perfect pace that makes it almost impossible to think about the movie at a critical angle, at least within the film's duration. Even the opening scene, which has no purpose other than to illustrate the violent and dangerous lives of the inhabitants of Compton is wildly intense, a pulse-pounding escape scene that I didn't see coming from a mile away. So this, in a nutshell, is what Straight Outta Compton does right: It is unexpectedly riveting, creating solid entertainment out of simple things like dialogue, soundtrack, and excellent visual direction.However, when you think past the excellent filmmaking, Straight Outta Compton becomes rather childish and decadent, eventually losing its ability to showcase N.W.A.'s drama without resorting to silly, mobster-mentality fuelled scenes and opulent displays of wealth. It ceases to become a film about a group of young men overcoming cultural and racial struggles through music, morphing eventually into a tale about rich people who go around breaking things, beating each other up, engaging in gleeful misogyny, and getting richer. While it presented itself as a very promising 'rags-to-riches' tale, the 'rags' ended about a quarter of the way through, replaced by an irredeemable amount of 'riches'. As the film progresses, it loses its authenticity as a character drama.The acting, however, is fantastic. Every member of N.W.A. has a distinct and charged-up personality. O'Shea Jackson Jr. plays his father Ice Cube, and it's obvious that the man knows the type of guy his dad was. Not only is his acting done with all the expected fury, his performance is deep, making him more than just a character in a story. The film mostly revolves around Eazy-E, played by Jason Mitchell. Mitchell is relied on for the emotional pinnacle of the film, and he gives it his all in a few heartrending scenes. The actors are amazing talented, but the screenplay makes the characters, and this screenplay sees it fit to make these characters into rich thugs.The tagline for the poster reads: 'The World's Most Dangerous Group'. If this were to be so, I would assume that the group originally had some sort of 'ruthless' political ambition. But it's hard to see that in the film. In fact, the underlying purpose of their musical ambition is kept ambiguous, never amounting to anything more than money, guns, and women. The political venom reflected in their songs never extends to their behaviour. They are unjustly treated, but by the way they carry themselves, it doesn't seem like they care. For a group called N.W.A. (and I'm assuming that the meaning of the acronym is universally known), they have surprisingly little attitude.Although the film may be strangled by its decadence in its later stage, it has its best and most memorable moments on the streets of Compton. The director is attached to the place, and depicts it not only as a cruel place, but as a reluctant sanctuary. Gray paints a vulgar, yet beautiful canvas on these dangerous streets where life is rough, tensions run high, and dreams are no more than dreams.",6,4,29,8 September 2015
Ben-Hur," Hollywood's Great Epic
","Hollywood has forgotten the epic. Instead of the grand, sweeping and powerful stories -- complete with an overture and intermission -- that characterized cinema of the late 50s and early 60s, our 'epics' are shapeless bores without likable characters and original stories. Instead of chariot races charged with righteous vengeance (and moral ambiguity), we have Matthew Mcconaughey conquering the galaxy with Southern-tongued exposition unintentionally bespeckled with gleeful hilarity.If you're thirsting for something loud and powerful (as I was), then Ben-Hur is the film for you. It's unabashedly epic, thunderous, and raw, eliciting wows at every twist, turn, and gargantuan set piece it throws your way. Charlton Heston plays the righteous Jewish prince, returned from wrongful imprisonment in the galleys to take revenge on the man who imprisoned him, his big shiny teeth flashing in the sunlight.The action scenes themselves are stunning. The chariot race is one of the most fantastically involving sequences I have ever seen.However, it's undeniable Jewish propaganda, especially considering the glaring historical inaccuracy -- or in this case, a purposeful exclusion of historical facts . And yet, with multiple Jesus cameos, it sees fit to pass itself off as a Christian film. As a sort of religious outsider, I have no right to comment on that, though. What I can comment on is the flowery dialogue. It's consistently sweeping, yes, but also consistently drawn out and occasionally laughably cheesy. But it's epic. And I suppose that given the sheer entertainment value offered up by this film, its faults are barely more than an afterthought.",7,0,2,8 May 2016
Lucy," A terrible movie with a few good ideas
","Lucy feels like a misplaced mash-up of silly sci-fi and a weird theoretical documentary, spiralling drearily from its boring beginning to its mind-blowingly pretentious ending. Sadly, it fails in both genres, sacrificing promising action for undue intelligence and coherence for unnecessary visual intricacy, eventually creating a film that is so wrapped up in its far-fetched ideas, it cannot fathom even itself. However, there are certain brief moments in the film that are strangely interesting, occasionally even stimulating the mind beyond what is expected of a common Hollywood action film. That being said, those moments are extremely rare, and barely make up for the overwhelming awfulness of this ridiculous mishmash.The film begins with our hero, Lucy (played by the wonderfully distant Scarlett Johansson), being blackmailed, witnessing the death of the guy who blackmailed her, and crying an awful lot. Even from the beginning, as the dazed lighting, lack of definite setting and deliberately pretentious cuts to random nature shots (which are even more poorly lit) suggest, this movie has a bloated idea of itself, not realizing that it has provided nothing in its initial few minutes to hold the viewer in any way. Even the subsequent scene in which Scarlett Johansson is interrogated drags on for an awful long time, eventually becoming boring and repetitive.The movie eventually finds a premise: Lucy is exposed to some fancy new drugs which gradually allow her to use an increased amount of her brain, turning her not only into a lethal killing machine, but also an omnipotent goon with a Messiah complex. With all this new brainpower (and also the knowledge that she is going to die within the next 24 hours), she decides to bequeath her newfound knowledge to humanity, choosing a theoretical neuroscientist (Morgan Freeman) to be her disciple. This choice is made without any explanation, but whatever.Although my interest in the film remained nonexistent up until this point, I began to feel a certain vile hope creep up upon me, that hope manifesting itself as the promise of crazy, telekinesis-fuelled action scenes. The film had finally slithered past its horrible beginning, its ridiculous premise, and now could proceed into passive, violent oblivion. But, unfortunately, the film saw it fit to avoid such action for completely unnecessary visual eye-grabbers, and mundane sci-fi chatting. The action is thin, kept to a minimum, and slightly disgusting. It feels like the product of the mind of a teenager: unevenly paced, poorly filmed, pretentious, and laughable. Even the characters are unwatchable, being either stunningly wooden, evil, or simply boring.But eventually the film reaches its ending, where Lucy travels back in time and learns everything there is to know. That one short scene should have been a movie within itself. The visuals are breathtaking, but divinely subtle as well, picking apart what we think we know and showing us what is beyond the limits of our knowledge with such ease and fluidity, that it is hard to dismiss it. Of course, it's all unfounded nonsense, but it's stunning unfounded nonsense. Then, as a final reminder of how terrible this movie is, it shows us that all that was just an excuse to make Lucy into God. Huzzah. The End.This film isn't really sure what cinematic path to follow, and its failure to span two at once makes it entirely unwatchable.",3,3,9,4 September 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," An exercise in nostalgia and CGI
","After watching this film (and being relatively unimpressed by it), I went to Superstore to pick up a few groceries. Unexpectedly, the film's value hit me there, rather than when I was in the theater watching the film, as it was in the store that I became aware of modern film's propensity to market rather than to innovate. Pictures of Stormtroopers, Rey, Finn, and Kylo Ren crowded the shelves, plastered onto Shreddies' boxes, Jam jars, Eggs, TV screens, clothing, toothpaste, organic chips, and even diapers. I realized that a two and a quarter hour exercise in bland escapism had managed to transcend the silver screen, embedding itself firmly in our everyday lives, from our diapers to our cereal. While I do find this rather abhorrent, I can't deny that it is definitely remarkable.Art and novelty have been pushed to the side in favour of economic triumph. The Force Awakens, buoyed onwards by skillful marketing and rabid nostalgia, will end up as one of the highest-grossing films of all time. Collectibles, diapers, cereal, etc. branded with characters and logos will bring in even more billions of dollars. And, as we glance at the lineup of big-budget blockbusters coming to theatres (Batman vs Superman, TMNT 2, Allegiant (split into two parts), remakes, reboots, and a slew of Marvel and DC extravaganzas) it seems as if Hollywood has figured out that this is the way to go. It has finally donned the costume of a clown that knows only one trick, but can do it better (and bigger) each time.I'm not down on Hollywood. I'm down on (most) modern action films for their money-grubbing emptiness, and the new addition to the Star Wars franchise exemplifies my sentiment.Star Wars: The Force Awakens is highly reminiscent of the original trilogy, borrowing plot points, scenes, and characters directly from the most memorable and enjoyable bits in Lucas's classic galactic romp. Although this is at first quite fun, one eventually realizes that this film brings nothing new to the table, except for a plethora of CGI and a surprising new character. The film's fear to be its own film is its undoing. It panders to expectations, forcing the audience to be unable to watch the film without comparing it to what came before.My excitement at being returned to the Star Wars universe ended after the opening crawl.The Force Awakens begins in about the same way as A New Hope. A base of some sort is attacked, a droid (who communicates in beeps) is given a valuable piece of information by some guy, who is taken prisoner by the First Order (led by a creepy guy in a mask with a low voice named Kylo Ren). Damn, what movie did I just describe? The plot eventually takes a better hold, with a Stormtrooper named going rogue, teaming up with some girl named Rey (who has found the droid), and them leaving the planet, chased by Stormtroopers, in...the Millennium Falcon. And or course, since they brought the Millennium Falcon back, they have to bring Han Solo back, so they do, and he's, well, old. Chewbacca hasn't aged a day, though.And while all this is happening, the new Death Star (Basically the original Death Star except a planet) blows up a bunch of planets, while Kylo Ren feels the 'pull of the light'. I wanted to punch the screenwriter in the face at this point. One does not simply have the bad guy kill billions of people, and then have the audience sympathize with him. Sure, Darth Vader did the same thing, but in A New Hope, he was the essence of evil. Ren is weak, boring, and takes off his mask way too early in the film.Oh, and the Emperor is there too. But he's got a different name. Coke or Snoke, or something like that.The screenplay is rather poor. The characters and their interactions are forced and implausible. No secrets are kept from the audience. Many of the pivotal plot elements occur by chance. I felt as if the screenwriter lacked sensitivity to the things that he wrote as the film did not deliver story and innovation. Instead, it served to recreate the plot all of us Star Wars fans know, and amp it up with visuals, while not realizing that simply by copying the success of the original trilogy (and not even copying it well), it is a useless cinematic experience.Although I did not like the film, I would still like to applaud the visual effects team. Some shots and sequences were simply divine. The recreation of the bridge scene from Empire Strikes Back is gorgeous (albeit ridiculously scripted), and the final battle scene is rousing enough to be commendable. If the screenwriter and crew were passionate about making something original and sensible rather than appealing to nostalgia, I think that The Force Awakens would have actually been worthy of its critical acclaim. But as it stands, The Force Awakens is insipid, lethargic nostalgia that attempts to reignite the franchise's former prestige without feeling a need to create its own.",6,15,21,20 December 2015
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Fantasy at its finest
","The final chapter of Peter Jackson's adaptation of The Lord of the Rings trilogy is a fitting, if overlong send-off to the characters and story that have by now become legendary works, both in literature and cinema. It encapsulates all that was good --and to a lesser extent, all that wasn't so good -- about the first two films and amplifies it with gleeful abandon. Although fans of the original two may be slightly bothered by the final film's extravagance, it is necessary given that any less would be seen as a step down from the mounting visual and technical brilliance embodied by the first two.One cannot deny that The Return of the King is a technical masterpiece, but some of its subplots unnecessarily supersede the more important plot: that of Frodo, Sam and Gollum. Many of them -- especially the Arwen/Aragorn subplot, which is as forgettable as can be -- reek with a pungent silliness, mostly due to their inability to tell a complete story without resorting to blunt dialogue. Although this spares us another hour or two tacked on the running time, it reduces the overall effect.This film shows a definite shift in focus from Frodo and Sam to Aragorn, Rohan, and Minas Tirith, morphing from an adventure film into a tense political drama of alliances, war, and of course, impending destruction. The first half of the film (not much unlike Jackson's Battle of the Five Armies, which I will not speak of again) is presented as buildup for the second. Preparations for war are made, alliances are formed, and then, WAR.Upon witnessing the first act of the Siege of Minas Tirith, I knew that I was in for an entirely new experience. In the Two Towers and The Fellowship of the Ring, death was treated with dignity and restraint, but as we see by the Orcs' initial fear-mongering tactic -- showering Minas Tirith with the body parts of prisoners (many of which are shown in bloody detail) -- this is to be no such war. It is a bloody, extremely long, extremely violent war, complete with flying bodies, decapitations, elephants which crush riders underfoot and burning bodies alive. Although it is pure and gleeful spectacle, it is up to the viewer to decide whether or not it is worth all the death they are forced to sit through.The climax of the film makes it all worth it. It was so triumphant, magnificent, and powerful that I could not help but shed a few hapless tears. You really get a sense of the scope of Frodo's quest, and his beautiful relationship with Sam. Tolkien excelled at interjecting violence, darkness and despair with brief moments of friendship, hope, and love. Jackson encapsulates this perfectly.Seldom have I seen a film that embraces its literary roots with such fervent admiration, and while that alone is admirable, it is amplified by the fact that the film is actually good. Sure, it's silly and filled with Deus Ex Machina, but it's a beautiful, rousing sort of silliness that will live on for decades to come.",8,0,1,15 February 2016
Deadpool," Ryan Reynolds and the quest for hotness
","Ryan Reynolds is despicable. And while it's quite possible that I hate him out of jealousy, glancing over his filmography (which is primarily composed of egregious nonsense) I can say with a certain degree of confidence that that is likely not the case. Reynolds has never had the opportunity to endear himself to his audience, being consistently the star in projects that cast him in the worst possible light: a straight-up, no holds barred, unapologetic douchebag.That being said, the character of Deadpool is widely known for his zany vulgarity, so perhaps Reynolds was in fact the right choice. A famed douchebag to play a fictional famed douchebag? Sounds right to me.But once again, Reynolds' capacity to entertain is destroyed by a real yawner of a script, that pretends to elevate itself above (or even below) its comic-book predecessors with fourth-wall breaks, awful jokes, and graphic violence. While all this could have been effective in creating a delightfully subversive comic-book film that poked fun at literally everything with gleeful abandon, it eventually devolves into a blatantly self-congratulatory splatterfest that assumes that it has achieved its goal of challenging modern film without doing so itself.Despite Deadpool's unique take on the superhero genre, it all revolves around a formulaic, ridiculous plot populated with unlikeable characters. Ryan Reynolds stars as ex-special forces something-or-other named Wade Wilson, who goes around being a jerk to stalkers. He then finds a woman at a bar, who is equally despicable, and they have great sex for a very, very long time. Then he gets cancer.Jesus Christ. Ex-special forces? The Punisher? No wait. He goes around being a jerk to stalkers. Sounds sorta like...Kick Ass! Wait, now he has cancer?! I'm not sure if Eddie Brock had cancer in the comics, but I think he did. And the sex? Well, that's basically every superhero, isn't it? Sigh. The formula is all too evident. Everything we see in this film, apart from the jokes, we've seen before in other films and comic books. And then, when it couldn't get any worse, it does.His cancer is cured by a not-so-nice guy named Francis, who subjects him to a lot of pain in a slew of equally cringe-worthy scenes that emphasize the writer and the director's lack of regard for the human condition. Oh yes, and the story is narrated by Deadpool himself. Which really sucks, because narrated stories naturally suck.Deadpool eventually gains his superpowers, which turn him into yet another invincible superhero. He says it himself. He can't die. I hate it when films do that, making (anti)heroes that can't die even after being completely wasted, as it suddenly removes any tension or risk factor that had hitherto existed.Subsequently, Deadpool devolves even further into a mess of bullets, blood, and humourless jokes all in the vein of Ryan Reynolds' quest to regain his beauty. Yes, it's as empty and ridiculous as it sounds. It may have even been saved had the jokes been funny in any way. I mean, that was what I wanted from the film. I knew that the plot and characters would likely be a letdown, but heard that the hilarity factor of the film more than made up for it. But I simply didn't laugh. Not once. And I found this unusual. It's not as if I don't appreciate nasty jokes. I laughed until it hurt in Spy, Borat, and The Dictator. Hell, I even laugh at Mike Tyson Mysteries. But this film, despite its obvious intention to leave me laughing, left me completely impassive, if not outright disgusted.This film includes some nice cameos, which I certainly didn't expect (having avoided the trailers out of anticipation), a few well-done action scenes which brim with glorious movement, a cool, popping' soundtrack that I couldn't help but look up, and a neat visual style. But despite this, it's still a very, very poor film that left me exceedingly disappointed.I would recommend Deadpool only for its novelty, although whether such novelty is a step forward or backward is in your hands to determine.",4,12,26,13 March 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Kingsman rips your soul from your body with terrifying ease
","You know what made Roger Ebert a great critic? He enjoyed movies more than he enjoyed being enjoyed for enjoying movies. His writing made it obvious, little emotional flourishes and gorgeous analogies that set him in another league, miles away from many other critics. To him, films were not technical achievements; rather, they were human experiences, emotional experiences, philosophical experiences, or even intellectual experiences. He was one of the few critics that wanted films to affect him, rather than reveling in his power to affect a film's ratings. To put it bluntly, Ebert's taste emerged from his existence not as a film critic, but as a human.Ebert took Vaughn's Kick Ass (2010), and justly gave it one star, asking his readers 'Will I seem hopelessly square if I find Kick-Ass morally reprehensible'? Well, I certainly thought so. I loved Kick-Ass, and although I have felt slight ethical twinges during recent viewings, my reasoning went as follows 'The bad guys get wasted, and they're bad guys, so I don't really give a damn if they get blown up.' Kingsman: The Secret Service makes Kick-Ass look like an episode of the Teletubbies. The bad guys get wasted, the not so bad guys get wasted, the good guys get wasted, about fifty or so bigots get wasted, the whole world wastes itself, and finally, a cheeky little princess gets wasted (but not in the same way as everyone else), each getting wasted in the most obscene and bloody way imaginable.Kingsman is a surprisingly unfunny and disturbing little film, packaged with irresistible stylishness and beguiling obscenity. Perhaps I should specify: the film in itself isn't very disturbing, but the way it goes about masking its amorality, and the fact that so many people are blind to it definitely is. Most of it is rather bland, but when it isn't, it is mind-blowingly insane. But my question to you, not as a critic (although I suppose that designation isn't deserved, owing to the widespread abhorrence of my IMDb reviews) asking a reader, but as a human to another human, is 'At what cost?' Kingsman has a solid structure: a talented yet extremely crude young man (Taron Egerton) whose life is drifting towards the dark world of drugs and crime is given the opportunity to join a secret spy agency, an opportunity which he readily accepts. But things aren't as easy as they seem, as he is one of several candidates who must compete in a series of death-defying trials to eventually earn a place in the agency. The other candidates are wonderfully cocky, posh British boys whom you can't help but hate, and a girl, Roxy, is also thrown in there simply to shake things up. Meanwhile, billionaire genius Richmond Valentine is plotting to end global warming through unknown, but obviously sinister means.The training scenes are the best parts of the film, at times hilarious, at other times spectacularly intense, but at all times fun as hell. But then the film sees fit to dissolve itself in a moral cesspool with the most stylish and well-done massacre that I have ever seen in my entire life. I'm sorry, but as well-done as it is, I have to say that it was an awful experience. Sure, the people who get killed are bigots (I congratulate Vaughn on his meticulous manipulation of my sensibilities), but the sheer body count, and the simple glorification of indiscriminate death is too much (or too little?) for me to bear. Since when did entertainment have to be all about pointless and startlingly gruesome death? Then began my struggle. Do I buy into this? Or do I reject it? Each subsequent scene brought even more fun than the last, pulling me back into the film, assuring me that I wasn't a monster for enjoying (?) the film. It is made with such seductive glee and that it is hard to remember how awful the film's ideas and intentions actually are. But finally, Kingsman reaffirms my abhorrence by killing literally everyone.What terrifies me about the film is that my friends love it. What terrifies me even more is the fact that this film has received critical acclaim. And what terrifies me the most is that I almost enjoyed it as well.Kingsman: The Secret Service is a lurid film made for those without moral scruples. It is stylish and fun, (even though its humour comes across as rather bland) at the expense of hundreds, maybe even thousands of lives. The fact that this counts for entertainment (and good entertainment at that) in our world is rather a poor reflection on us as a species. I urge you, all of you, to attempt to engage your moral compass when watching films, because if we can look at this film and deem it acceptable, then there is something very wrong with us indeed. Remember Ebert, and remember what made him the greatest film critic the world has ever known.",4,2,6,7 November 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," A vision of (almost) pure insanity
","Mad Max: Fury Road is true cinema. It does not, like the inescapable mass of dull summer movies, rely on a makeshift script and thoroughly uninteresting characters to sell tickets to a largely indifferent audience looking for two hours of bland entertainment for no reason other than to pass the time. Rather, Mad Max: Fury Road breaks well and solidly free of common summer movies. It is not only riveting, it is deliciously shot and well-directed, an art movie and blockbuster rolled beautifully into one. The film stars Tom Hardy as Max Rockatansky, a solitary man trying to survive in a harsh desert wasteland, haunted by visions of his past. Tom Hardy instills a certain desperation within his character, almost making him seem like an animal, void of intellect and feeling. 'A man reduced to one instinct ‚Äì survival'. Tom Hardy plays the role very well, but he sometimes comes across as good ol' Bane in his mannerisms, a man of few words and a whole lot of muscle.Now, while Tom Hardy kills his role, Charlize Theron butchers hers. She plays Imperator Furiosa, a one-armed woman who teams up with Max to escape the warlord Immortan Joe's Citadel, armed with a massive 'War Rig' and a group of young women referred to as Immortan Joe's 'breeders'. This role is easily the best role Charlize Theron has ever taken on. Her cold, piercing stare is as unsettling as the insanity raging around her. She is not, like summer movies nowadays would have us believe, a woman who simply exists to remove her clothing for the pleasure of a man. She comes across as a pinnacle of morality, strength, and power, better than anyone else on the screen could come even remotely close. Screw off, men's rights activists. I'm a man, and I can see that this is not feminist propaganda. This is just an unprecedentedly spectacular performance from Charlize Theron that does not involve her being a sexual object. Men's rights activists¬Öwow.Of course, however, this film was not made to showcase Charlize Theron. This film was meant to convey pure and terrifyingly logical insanity that races purposely through your mind like a centipede, scorching your eyes and smashing your brains out, augmenting your own little crevices of insanity hidden deep within you until you are gasping under the strain of it. I, for one, occasionally wanted to stand up on my chair and scream. I was never sure why. The chase scenes (which encompass almost the whole movie) are beautiful. It seems as if each shot was meticulously chosen in order to send a rush of adrenaline pulsing through the audience. Each explosion. Each maniacal yell and flying body. Each gunshot. Each and every flipping car. And a final, explosive flying 3D guitar. Each element of this film makes the audience understand that they are in the hands of a master director that has been crafting this wonderfully intense story for thirty years. This film should be the standard for summer movies.Notice that I said that this film should be the standard for summer movies. I don't believe that it exceeded it to the point where it should be immortalized in the canon of incredible action movies. The final battle scene, while being as visually commanding as the other ones, was not as epic as I had expected it to be considering all the buildup that it had leading up to it. It felt much like the other scenes, invoking a sort of d√©j√† vu that greatly reduced its effect. I was expecting a Matrix subway fight. Instead, I got the lobby scene for the second time. Now, that is not to say that this film is in any way bad. This film is very good, just not the excellent film that it had every right to be.George Miller scorns Hollywood's money-grubbing emptiness with this film. You can almost hear his voice amid the chaos and violence saying, 'Seriously, is that all you can do?'Rating: 9/10",9,5,12,17 May 2015
All the President's Men," I wasn't ready. Not at all.
","I was not at all prepared for All the President's Men. I had picked it up from the library a few weeks earlier with the misguided assumption that I would have time to watch it in the next few days. A veritable onslaught of tests, assignments, and social events almost denied me the opportunity to see the film, but I managed to cobble a few hours together on a Friday night. By then, I was exhausted, settling in for what I hoped would be a passive two hours of fun.Boy, was I wrong.All the President's Men hit me harder than a fiery cannonball. As the film spiralled on, I realized (to a considerable amount of shock) that I actually needed to pay attention, that if I didn't keep track of all the names and titles as they flew in and out of my soggy cerebrum, the film would be little more than a waste of time. Pakula wasn't about to serve his film up on a silver platter.All The President's Men depicts the single-handed crusade of two journalists at the Washington Post, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein in unearthing the truth of the Watergate burglary. I'll warn you, it's riotously fast-paced, perhaps the most fast-paced film I have ever seen. If you so much as blink, you might miss something extremely important, and cease to understand subsequent events. The two reporters are unceasingly on the trail, piecing things together at amazing speed.That, if anything, makes this film a good film: it forces you to engage your mind. Pakula assumes an impressive level of intelligence on the part of the audience (or at least some background knowledge) that many directors deny as even a possibility. But I personally believe that it was a bit too much for a first encounter with Watergate. The film was released in 1976, while the event happened in 1972, only four years before. Thus, the 1976 audience would remember the events, having lived through them, and most importantly, would recognize the names of the people involved. I, as a 90s kid, didn't really have this advantage, and floundered hopelessly as a result.Despite this, the film does have a general accessibility to the average film-goer in terms of acting, cinematography, and dialogue. Redford and Hoffman are undeniably excellent as Woodward and Bernstein, bringing a violent energy to each of their characters in their unshakable pursuit of the truth. All their actions in the film are for one goal, and one goal only: to get the story, and to get it right. There is a small degree of unevenness in Woodward's character in that he shifts between passive and aggressive too often to be unnoticeable, but Bernstein's character is defined and executed excellently. Also, Jason Robards is perfect as the tough-talking, gruff American newspaperman.The cinematography, while uneven, is often excellent. The scenes in the parking garage and the Washington Post headquarters are done very well, each conveying an entirely different atmosphere, and doing it well. I did notice some strange issues with focus, in that half of a frame would be in focus while the other half would not, which was very off-putting and strange.The dialogue was gorgeous. Modern films aren't able to convey the inherent fallibility of language as a human tool, and always forget that humans are inconsistent in speech. In this film, the characters make mistakes all over the place with their dialogue, and actually say the word 'um', which was definitely a pleasant surprise. The language gives you the feeling that you're listening to real people, not actors.I give All the President's Men a 6/10 in absentia of actually having seen the film. I'll explain: I saw the film, but I had only the slightest idea of what was happening, and thus, haven't really seen the film. I had no idea that the film was going to end when it did, and when it did, I was more confused than I had ever been after watching a film. I'm almost certain that the film is good, but can't be sure. I guess I'll have to watch it again.",7,2,3,15 November 2015
The Martian," The Martian: Funny, thrilling, and ultimately satisfying
","The Martian, as a fantastic technical achievement that paints eerie, orange-soaked portraits of the bleak plains of Mars, is one hell of a film. There is many a shot that is breathtaking, inducing copious amounts of awe without resorting to visual exploitation. Scott takes a certain pride in being able to remove us from the theatre, placing us in a strange new world, that is not only lonely, but pristine and even beautiful. But what allows The Martian to go above and beyond your average planetary escapade is that it is not simply a technical achievement; it is well-written, intimate, and much more rewarding than I could have imagined.The Martian begins as Mark Watney (Matt Damon), a NASA botanist, is lost in a massive dust storm. His crew, presuming him dead, leave the planet, leaving him stranded with no means of contacting them, or anyone for that matter. From there, the film is one big problem-solving session, as Watney does self-surgery, figures out how to grow food (which involves feces), and eventually figures out how to contact NASA, while dealing with setbacks, including disco music, explosions, and of course, despair. Damon is excellent as Watney, giving his character a charming, irresistible optimism, a sense of humour, and a clever resourcefulness, but while his wisecracking is the film's greatest asset, it also may be a weakness as well. Perhaps Goddard, or Weir for that matter could have allowed his character to touch a bit more substantially on existential matters, or even to show his obvious despair to the tiniest degree. But I suppose that there is a fine line between being emotionally superhuman, and a whiny slug, perhaps even too fine to pinpoint a reasonable middle. Despite this, Damon's character is inimitable and fun to watch.NASA eventually figures out, to their consternation, that they have left an astronaut on Mars, sparking off a series of frantic grasping at whatever straws pop out of nowhere. The sequences on Earth are much less interesting than the ones on Mars, often characterized by space movie clich√©s. We are once again exposed to pleasantly familiar things, including the infamous control room, the boardrooms, the press conferences, the conservative CEO, the super smart (yet super skinny) dude who just happens to be the greatest genius the world has ever seen, international fervour, etc. However, just because they are clich√©d does not mean that they aren't fun. Sure, sometimes you might find yourself rolling your eyes and saying 'Where the heck did originality in cinema go?', but most of them are lively enough to allow you to forget that they are, in fact, standard space-film fare.The Martian is at its best, and its most beautiful when it is actually on Mars, following the main character as he figures small things out, often to the exhilaration and laughter of the audience. But as I've said before, the loneliness that he must have felt on Mars is not addressed. The days turn into months, which turn into years, and he is barely even fazed by his lack of human interaction. A little bit of philosophy, or existential pondering would have remedied this, but I don't really mind.What I did mind was the Deus Ex Machina. Everything seems to happen exactly at the right time, in the right place, and in the right proximity for it to be used to its full extent. There is a tremendous amount of luck pulling the strings in this film, and it makes the film feel rather artificial. However, the film's extraordinary premise needed the Deus Ex Machina to work, and considering the raw intensity and wonder of the ending, I believe that it did.The ending of the film was one that I doubt that I will ever forget. It is such a pulse-pounding, gorgeous blend of wonder, intensity, and sheer awesomeness, that it has wedged itself firmly and unshakably in my mind. I will not spoil it, but I will say that it has one of the most beautiful shots that I have seen so far this year. Or the last year, as a matter of fact. Thus, I will say this: The Martian is a wonderful and harrowing piece of planetary cinema, bringing itself to the forefront of 2015 in cinema with an excellent performance by Matt Damon, astounding visual artistry from Scott, and a powerful, beautiful, and intense conclusion.",7,5,44,4 October 2015
Furious 7," The wrong tribute to the wrong man
","Furious 7 is the ¬Ö seventh installment in the Fast and Furious franchise. Watching it makes it obvious that it has come a very long way from its 2001 days. It is loud, violent, and emotional, something that the previous films all seemed to strive towards but never could achieve to the degree that Furious 7 did. But was it too much? Was the decision to turn a small franchise about crime and street racing into a massive, apocalyptic film with insane, death-defying stunts even a good idea? Well, sure. But not to the extent of Furious 7. It is too loud, too violent, and too serious. Jason Statham removes all the lightness of the previous films with his sneering, annoying, black-op juggernaut vibe, while the clanking and smashing brings back cold-sweat nightmares of a casual trip to the imagination of Michael Bay. It almost makes me yearn for a delicate drama, something where the words are not canned and meaningless, where the meaning is complex, and where Jason Statham is in a world far removed from it. Which isn't to say the film is awful. It is stylish, funny, and sexist as always, filled with fancy cars and gasp-inducing moments. But I just think it takes it a bit too far, especially in its fighting scenes and the apparent invincibility of all the characters. They survive rollovers with a few scratches, getting hit in the face with wrenches with little cuts, and getting hit with bottles with little as much as a small moan. And whenever they get hit the theater fills with a massive, crunching thud that eventually gets hard to take.Here's the story in a nutshell. Owen Shaw's (villain from FAF6) big brother (Deckard Shaw) decides to take his revenge on Dominic Toretto and his crew for crippling his brother. Han is revealed to have been killed by Mr. Shaw, and Dominic is now Shaw's new target. Of course, Dominic is mad as heck. No one targets his family and lives to not go to jail.The film ends with the words 'For Paul' as we knew it would. The death of Paul Walker left everyone (or at least me) confused at how it would even be possible to make Furious 7 in the first place. But as I watched the sensitive, tasteful tribute at the end of the film, I began to feel a sort of emptiness. The tribute, I realized, was for the character, Brian O' Connor. Paul Walker was just who the film was dedicated to. The inescapable hypocrisy of the film began to become painfully evident.How did Paul Walker die? He was in a car accident involving a car driving at an insane velocity. He was killed going too fast. And yet, we glorify him in a film that is all about driving fast, and shows it to be completely safe. Nobody even gets hurt after driving off cliffs, crashing into trees, or driving out of buildings. By supporting this mentality, we are not honouring Paul Walker. We are contributing to his folly.The best way to honour him would be to not finish Furious 7, and to quietly abandon the franchise.",5,4,19,5 April 2015
