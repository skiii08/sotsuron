Raiders of the Lost Ark," Simply the BEST!
","Since seeing this as a kid no movie has ever completely captivated or amazed me like Raiders. It has held up extremely well over time. I am still in awe every time I see it, and that has probably been about 30 times. Simply put, this was the movie that started my love of movies. Nothing since has blown me away like Raiders, but there are others that have left lasting impressions, like Shawshank Redemption, Heat and Crash. I owe a lifetime of love and anticipation to Spielberg and Lucas. They were both on the top of their game when they created Raiders.If you are reading this and haven't seen Raiders, don't waste another moment. Go and see the greatest movie ever made.",10,0,1,25 January 2009
