Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Very Entertaining !!
","First of all when you go to see this film you've got to go with an open mind, don't expect it to be the worst or best film you've ever seen. Take no notice of the critics. That's the way I went into the cinema, with a pure open mind. Even if a stupid title on the soundtrack had already ruined the ending for me. Right, for starters when you watch tpm your going to see the greatest display of visual effects you've ever seen. The world that has been created for this film is absolutely amazing. There's so much detail throughout the entire film it truly is mind blowing. And then there's the story, thinking back to all the negative reviews I've seen saying 'where's the story' these people were obviously knitting a jumper or something while the film was on, cos the story is actually quite good. Its just the usual space rubbish, there's a trade ban on the planet naboo (something to do with taxes) and the senate want the queen to sign a treaty so they can take control of the planet, but its all a front for the baddies to get control...etc. I wont go on about it too much, because the story does get a wee bit confusing at times, but in reference to the characters the story has set itself up very nicely for the next episode. But these people who complain about the story, what did you expect, its star wars. Then there's Jar Jar Binks, I must admit I was very surprised at how tolerable he was. I managed to catch onto his speech straight away, I can imagine he must be irritating if you can't get what he's saying. But he did provide some very funny moments, especially the bit before the pod race. Ahh the pod race, let me tell you its worth going to see this film on the big screen just to see the pod race. Its funny (provided by the two headed commentator who is voiced by the excellent greg proops),its fast, very fast, its exciting and visually its outstanding. That acting in it is good na'll. Liam neeson was excellent (but then again he usually is) ewan mcgregor was good enough even if he was trying to be too english and natalie portman was excellent as the queen. The only complaint I have about the film was Jake Lloyd, he was just too annoying, he just never stopped talking but thankfully he wasn't in it enough to ruin the film. And he also provided a quite unbelievable climax to one of the sequences at the end of the film. But then again this is star wars, oh and the duel at the end between that mean mutha darth maul and the jedis is another outstanding action sequence. So go and see it. Just remember its star wars, its not going to be the best film you've ever seen, quite a bit of it is aimed at kids, just let it take you along for the ride and you will be entertained !!Final Verdict : Better than episode VI, not as good as IV or V but still a welcome addition to the series.",Null,0,0,16 July 1999
