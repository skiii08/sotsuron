Deja Vu," It hurts my brains
","I cannot believe the other user comments! Where was everything explained? Nowhere. Nothing adds up in the end!! I usually like supernatural content in movies, but at least it should be reasonable. Watching this movie you think that the writers just thought 'Ah, what the hell, doesn't matter, the audience won't notice that!' You feel like someone is trying to robb you with this cheap plot. If done right the movie and its story could get a 5 out of 10, but since nothing is really new about the movie and because of the cheap acting, especially the girl its not worth more than a boring Monday evening. Especially the ending is just a complete mess and it certainly hurts your brain while watching it. If not, I'm sorry for you.",2,7,13,7 August 2007
