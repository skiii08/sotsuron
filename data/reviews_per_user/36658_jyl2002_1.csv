Requiem for a Dream," Great movie, must see!
","Great movie, seen it three times. Good job on the part of Jared Leto. Who knew a pretty boy could play such a dramatic role and be that convincing.Ellen Burstyn was awesome! Great portrayal of speed freak to paranoid schizophrenic. I knew she was a winner ever since I first saw her on 'The Exorcist,' excellent movie by the way. Didn't care much for the closeups during the scenes where they were frantically running from one thing or another. Made them look pretty ridiculous really.Wow, Marlon Wayans was great, from idiot comedian to fine dramatic actor. He's usually a moronic fool but no sign of it here.",Null,0,1,11 October 2004
