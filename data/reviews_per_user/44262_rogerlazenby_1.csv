Skyfall," Worst Bond Ever?
","I consider myself something of a Bond (and movie) connoisseur. There are so so many things I hated about this movie. I was a little apprehensive when I saw all of the positive critical reviews. Do critics really 'get' Bond? Let me begin.Directing. I hated the pacing, the control of tension (or lack thereof). There were some good moments captured between the actors if you know what to look for, but I just felt the camera wasn't properly catching the energy of it.The script/story: It was horrible. I saw somebody compared it to Dark Knight Rises. Yes that is true if a 1st grader wrote it after thinking Dark Knight/Dark Knight Rises was awesome. They just used so many clich√© plot devices, trying to be something they aren't. YOU AREN'T BATMAN, YOU AREN'T CHRISTOPHER NOLAN! You are writing for a James Bond franchise that has been around 50 years!!!!!!!! Please do what you are good at, instead of trying to copy the new kid on the block. I don't want to get into spoiler territory... but I have seen all the Bonds in the theater since GoldenEye and this as probably my least favorite. I could see the ending coming from at least 1+ hour away.The acting: Good as always I must say. I liked the new Q. He was great in Cloud Atlas. (whoever he is, don't' feel like looking it up) Javier Bardem was great, but he was working with such a sub-par story. I did like the way he approached Bond from a sexually confused angle, that at least was new. But as a villain he just didn't have the je ne sais quoi of a typical Bond villain, and definitely not in the realm of someone like the Joker. We are to believe he is some villain with almost mythical abilities, but then he doesn't really exhibit that.I could rip this movie for about an hour but I don't feel the need. Just at least after you watch it come back and give it the 1 star review. (if you agree of course). It seems like lately every time a big movie comes out you see nothing but wonderful reviews. Think critically! If you haven't seen it already, just wait and rent it. You won't be sorry. If you have any taste that is.",1,13,27,9 November 2012
