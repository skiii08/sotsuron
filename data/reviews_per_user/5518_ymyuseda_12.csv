First of all, when i booking this ticket i don't know much who he is . I'm so excited to whatching this film because i want to know more about him.

Us," Not As Good As I Was Hoping
","Rating 6.9/10
Not as good as i was hoping. I went into the cinema expecting a good horror movie of this year. I found the movie more of a comedy than a horror !! So, in the end it's another run-of-the-mill horror film despite having a great story !! So far, actress Lupita Nyong'o a.k.a Adelaide Wilson have a good acting performance in this movie !! So disappointed !!",6,228,418,21 March 2019

This movie takes back you to late 60s retro. Wonderful cinematograpy and storyline to give new experience from different era's to audience.

Joker," Don't Believe The Hype
","Rating 4.5/10
I just buy ticket from PREMIUM HALL to see this movie because previously i saw a good reviews from IMDB. The previews of this movie make you want to see it, but it wasn't nearly as good as i expected it to be. The character of Joaquin Phoenix who is obviously suffering from mental illness is really bad and annoying !! I truly do not understand the high rating on this film. Very disappointing.",4,293,839,3 October 2019
It Chapter Two," True Friendship With Awful Story
","Rating 5.6/10
I honestly can't believe these reviews. This movie truly disappointed me. To director Andy Muschietti you should put more scenes about the clown, because i seen the scenes is just little bit. That is exactly what the screenwriter and director did to this failed abortain. This is not horror film. Terrifying, it is not. Scary it is not. There is nothing scary about this movie. There was so much wasted potential here. Consequently i found the movie too long and lost me some part of it. It just doesn't feel like anything great or memorable. Good bye clown and good bye Eddie.",5,409,637,6 September 2019
Midway," With Great Expectations Comes Disappointment
","Rating 4.0/10
I had high hopes for 'midway' war between America and Japan, unfortunetly this movie goes to war of the bored. With the epic status that this movie was advertised with, it was a supreme disappointment. You will willingly sit through this movie but when it's over you'll feel like you wasted two hours. The action and special effect was okay. But the movie is somewhat claustrophobic. The acting was okay even if at times the script seemed daunted. In the end, If i had to describe midway in one word it would be disappointing.",4,305,514,13 November 2019
