Black Swan," Dark Side of Dance
","Black Swan is a story about realization and how we discover ourselves when in new environments. Swan Queen is the role, and it takes its toll on Nina (Natalie Portman) as she struggles to release her inner darkness. Playing the lead role in this production requires both innocence and spontaneity. It is certainly not for everyone.The transformation of a sweet girl into a monster is the real hook in this film. How different settings can change people is a fascinating theme, and Natalie Portman certainly delivers in portraying how good becomes evil. The plasticity of our mind; how our behaviours are so volatile at times really reflects true human nature. I enjoyed Black Swan not for its acting (it was mediocre overall except for good performances from the leads), but because the story delved into the true essence of how we are all moulded by external factors. We all evolve over time, whether it be mentally or physically. And whether we accept this fact or not, Black Swan does an exceptional job in proving it.",6,2,5,29 September 2013
Gravity," Going to space would be cool, right?
","It's every kid's dream to go into space and one day venture into our Universe. With our galaxy alone being so large, it's no wonder that becoming an astronaut is a dream for many people since it is a chance for silence, beauty and peace. But what if there was suddenly no one to hear you. The black space full of stars was now filled with shrapnel headed towards you at very fast speeds. What if you no longer had no control over yourself?Gravity is an excellent movie with arguably Sandra Bullock's best performance of her career. With George Clooney as the perfect co-astronaut, the exceptional casting in this film definitely helped. The thought of wandering the Universe and exploring the unknown ends is a dream to some while drifting away without end is a nightmare for others. Overall, Gravity is a great film due not only to its superb special effects or compelling acting, but because it strokes the strings in every person's heart for adventure and thrill. It is a reminder of what our Universe has to offer and the potential for all that can happen to us.",7,2,4,13 October 2013
Se7en," A Different Story
","It is seldom that a movie with such an eerie mood can continue with a continuously building story line and characters who are so dynamic. Modernism and beliefs lie at the heart of the movie, and Se7en does an exceptional job in executing a great plot with even better acting.Most actors would not be capable of filling the roles of two detectives in such a morbid case. The stars Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt act wonderfully in their respective roles, and manage to remain in character and evolve throughout the film. Being initially introduced to the two men, both at different stages of life, viewers begin this exhausting journey which neither characters are prepared for. With superb performances, underlying themes and a carefully manipulated script, Se7en truly does succeed in encompassing the qualities every great movie should. The numerous connections to religious and social affiliations offer a different view of the world, and share the side of things most do not see. Although the acts displayed are corrupt, which is a purely subjective topic, insights into the mind of a killer offer this movie a trait most lack - perspective. The brilliantly written script, including fabrications many people would never even contemplate, puts Se7en on a new pedestal. This thought-provoking thriller is one for the ages, and is one that I highly recommend.",10,2,4,23 June 2013
The Big Lebowski," A fun frenzy!
","From the get-go, the Dude comes off as a nonchalant guy looking to take in the most of life without extravagance. His pacific nature, along with his friends (who can be polar opposites at times) are lovable characters who all love to bowl. But in all seriousness, this movie revolves around the misfortune(s) of Lebowski: a lovable passive man who just wants to enjoy life, but is put in a whirlwind instead. From the bowling alleys to the bridges, going on this adventure is constant excitement and joy. You can't help but smile to see the Dude take what life has to throw at him in the best way he can. Lebowski is quite the man, and this movie's highs (literally) and lows certainly prove it is more than just another dull comedy. Watching this movie even after hearing about all its reviews, I was still quite impressed in every aspect of the film. Whether it just be scenes of playing at the lanes, or taking a relaxing drive outside, I can't overemphasize how much I enjoyed this film. I highly recommend The Big Lebowski since I'm sure it will put a smile on your face...and even give you a little something to think about.",8,1,4,8 December 2013
The Babadook," Surprisingly Thrilling
","The Babadook is a strange name for an even stranger sequence of events surrounding the lives of a young fearful boy and his lonesome mother. At first glance, this movie seems rather ordinary. As time progresses, though, the story became strikingly eerie and drawing. The Babadook is seemingly everywhere, from the police station to your dreams, and once he gets in, there's no coming out.The entire setting, perfect casting and general execution of such an elegant story make this film a thriller from start to finish. You're always on your toes waiting for the next step, not knowing if Babadook will be there. It's this sense of urgency and anxiety that follows both you and the characters throughout the movie.With a subtle mix of love, action and genuine horror, The Babadook should not fail to please. It's been a while since I've been so enticed by a horror, but this film certainly did the trick.",8,6,13,13 December 2014
Oldboy," The world doesn't always laugh with you
","Oldboy is certainly one that is full of entertainment and twists. Unbeknownst of the thriller I was about to watch, this film offers an extremely thick but thought-provoking plot. At each step of the story, viewers try to question and seek out answers--only to be one (or several) step(s) behind.From the introduction, we follow a flamboyant character who's about to endure hardship like no other. Life is not always fair, and that statement is magnified in this tale. Imprisonment, especially without justification, is torture. Not knowing its extent is even worse. With each day no different than the last, time seemingly runs forever, and sanity is in low quantity as time progresses. Whether we agree or disagree with the antagonist's decisions is one debate (albeit one-sided), but the lesson taught by this extreme example is one that deserves reckoning. From the 'harmless' teases to the malicious attacks, everything we do has an effect, whether minuscule or grandiose in nature. Only time will tell our fate, but be conscientious, since you never know what may happen next.",8,0,3,5 October 2014
Black Book," Truth is at a shortage
","This film never falls short of entertaining. The Nazis are commonly depicted as pure evil and generalizations sweep over entire populations instead of considering special cases. The contrary can be said regarding resistance fighters--not all are trustworthy. World War II brought about great destruction in the 20th century, but it also transformed the world into a land filled with fear.Following the life of Ellis Stein (Carice van Houten), a young woman whose lost everything, this film depicts the various facades resistance fighters needed in order stay alive. Cunningness and deception are at the forefront of this movie, and simply walking outsides poses danger to each person's life. Being inside isn't even necessarily safe.Black Book is deeply thrilling and emotional. With the constant character development and war settling in the background, how life changes pre- and post-war is filled with both enjoyment and anxiety. With neither justice nor safety guaranteed, Black Book does an exceptional job in reflecting the story that many experienced.",9,0,1,6 July 2014
Hot Fuzz," Dare to Ponder?
","Hot Fuzz is on the of the most fun movies I've seen in a while. Following officer Nicholas Angel on a frenzy that doesn't end, this film will entertain throughout its span with its crude yet subtle comedy. The interesting detective work doesn't hurt either. The police force means something to different to everyone, but to constable Angel, it means ensuring the law is upheld at all times. From his bouts with intoxicated minors to rampant ruffians in both the city and countryside, he surely sees it all. With all this under his belt, things go awry in the perfect village that is Sandford, and it's up to him as sergeant to figure out this intricate mystery. This film has a bit of everything in it and the delivery and casting was well done. You're constantly waiting to see what's developing and it surely is enjoyable from start to end. All things considered, Edgar Wright deserves a kudos for this gem.",8,0,0,30 November 2014
Dead Poets Society," Seize the Day!
","Having a strong role model is instrumental in the development in our lives. Whether it's an athletic coach, parent or an English teacher, we are all touched uniquely by those around us. We are all arguably trying to attain happiness in our lives. This can range from searching for love and exploring the world to volunteering at the local animal shelter. Regardless of 'what' we strive to do, it is important to realize we are genuinely interested in fulfilling this void. Poetry is more than just another form of expression. Language is arguably the strongest tool we as humans have, and is a special talent that can be used to accomplish extraordinary feats. Throughout the education system, students (and even teachers) often begin to forget the purpose and importance of the content being learned.Enter Mr. Keating.He is no simple man nor is he carrying a stringent course outline. He allows his students freedom; the chance to realize and fulfil their potential, whatever that means. He encourages his students to explore, understand and seriously think about society and the world we live in. He is an example of what every child deserves...what they need. It is sad to see people live like drones despite the immense opportunities the work has to offer. It is crucial that we learn to seize the day and actually make the most of our lives!Living your life according to your will and yours alone is a testament that should be widely advocated. Not one where people are necessarily individualistic, no, but one where everyones learns to enjoy every moment of their lives. Why spend your life doing something you don't enjoy? Be passionate and live, since the worst death is one while you're still alive.",8,0,0,2 February 2014
Insomnia," Clear Cut
","Insomnia is almost a collage of several other mystery films (namely Se7en) tied into one, but not distinctively. Although it wasn't completely repetitive, it was as cliché as detective work goes, and the movie didn't stand out one way or another. Whether it's the elusive murderer on the loose or the mentally plagued cop who's trying his best, this movie is predictable and lacks ingenuity. Accompanying the lack of creativity, the prime actors and actresses had average performances and the emotional conviction in the roles was often lacking. A straight plot followed by routine dialogue made Insomnia rather mundane and an effort to watch. Although there were particular exciting scenes, they were rather short and sparse. The resources were there, but execution was a miss.Whether it's L.A. Confidential, The Usual Suspects, Se7en or any other great mystery movie, these all had a strong emotional attachment that hook viewers into truly empathizing with the protagonists and mystery at hand. Unfortunately in Insomnia, it's almost like you already know the fate of the characters, and still don't care.",5,7,14,23 November 2014
Don Jon," The Struggle of Modern Times
","This movie certainly revolved around an interesting topic. Pornography is prevalent throughout society in all forms of media, and it's no surprise that it's one of the most common addictions today. Learning about this movie, I was interested from the beginning since it was a film that tackled a relatively sensitive issue head-on. For this, I congratulate the crew who produced Don Jon, but there were definitely flaws it should have addressed first. The plot was...dull. Man sleeps, cleans his house, goes clubbing, has sex. Then masturbates. Going to Church to repent for sins yet committing the offence is something I agree many in the world do today. I just wish it showed some form of sincere repentance or even just a push to change since it diminishes the whole act. The movie starts to become incredulous here and only becomes more illogical later. Afterwards, the relationships seem a bit too bizarre. The romantic ones do not seem to be anything but physical. It appears the world is full of sex-driven individuals whose only desire is coitus. This version of life just seems so extreme and incongruent with normal society. Even the ties between siblings and parents are distant and it's hard to take this movie seriously when everyone's so detached from each other. With enough will power, stopping anything is possible. To kick an addiction literally overnight, if it is as deeply rooted as depicted in this movie, doesn't seem realistic, though. The overall plot, even little things like dinners with his family, chilling with his friends and just total disregard for his future give me the impression that Jon is a pretty static character who's unwilling to change. The acting itself had to be some of the worst I had personally seen as well. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is one of my favourites, but he disappointed me greatly after Don Jon. The sheer lack of emotions throughout the movie just prevented myself from relating with any aspect of it. I honestly found it a struggle to keep watching since it all just came across as artificial. I can honestly say that my initial excitement quickly disappeared as I realized this movie was just about a man living a hedonistic lifestyle in a self-indulging society. That's it...",3,1,8,23 December 2013
The Terminator," The Haunting Future
","The Terminator is a movie with a complex background that manages to deliver a simple yet strong story by staying true to the characters. Often times, films that deal with time travel tend to be confusing or full of holes, but The Terminator surprised me by developing a plot that was not only simple but emotional.The settings and mood throughout the entire movie really emphasize a state of panic, and it is definitely a thrilling experience from beginning to end. The acting is not exceptional, but nonetheless, the cast certainly does not fail in their respective roles. Every aspect of this movie was well planned, and the great combination of technical features and an overall sound script make this movie a model for all future action films. Although I wish they explored other options in fighting the Terminator, I guess that's what sequels are for. The Terminator takes viewers on a journey of constant fear, anxiety, and panic, and it's exactly because of this that The Terminator is a classic thriller.",6,0,2,11 August 2013
Crash," Heart of Controversy
","I will admit, Crash is a very emotional movie. It depicts the lives of strangers and how we're all so connected yet distant from our neighbours. Racism is at the centre of this movie, and prejudice seems to cause countless problems in everyone's lives in one way or another. There's constant battles between doing good or bad and overall, this film is definitely entertaining both on a superficial and mental level. Although Crash was a very interesting movie, I felt the amount of drama was overdone and it almost seemed artificial at instances. Don't get me wrong; there certainly were moments of genuine panic and relief. But at specific moments, I could easily distinguish the storyline as fabricated when I really shouldn't have been able to, and this reduced its otherwise strong relatability. The acting in this film was excellent. Performances from actors like Michael Peña and Matt Dillon really pulled this film together and were by far some of my favourite scenes. The perfect settings and contrast between different lives really give this movie an edge and is the reason I, among many others, truly enjoyed this film from beginning to end.I definitely think the racial themes addressed in this film were very revealing--though arguably a little plastic--and helped relate this movie with modern times. I am glad I watched this film since it shows the stark disparities between two individuals, and it highlights the numerous parallels as well.",6,0,3,15 December 2013
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," The War We Don't Realize
","As the sequel to Captain America: The First Avenger, I was pleased to see how DC connected completely different timeframes and plots into a unifying film. After a subpar first movie in this series, my expectations were low to say the least. The Winter Soldier surely surpassed them. People consider Captain America to be freedom and justice encapsulated into a super-human body. As S.H.I.E.L.D (the organization Captain America aids) becomes more and more powerful, people with alternate perspectives begin to corrupt the freedoms of the public. When times turn dark, it's hard to see who's really on which side.Sharing numerous parallels with modern society (and past cultures), it introduces how passive and compliant citizens are to governments that readily take advantage, commit heinous crimes and infringe on the very rights these respective nations are built upon. People are resistant to change when they have a pleasing, comfortable lifestyle. Unfortunately, their unwillingness to rebel blinds them by the valueless pleasures that are offered instead. I enjoyed Captain America because it reminds everyone of the evil people are capable of, but also the good. We may feel alone fighting a battler, but truly never are.",7,0,2,10 August 2014
Interstellar," Anything that can happen, will happen
","This is sci-fi at its greatest. Entertaining. Thought-provoking. Inspiring.There is a lot to love about Interstellar. Whether it's the breathtaking cinematography or the sentimental moments filled with awe, this is certainly an epoch. Earth is not sustainable—a poignant point clearly expressed throughout the film. With space exploration an upcoming necessity, this movie not only breaks the surface, but delves into the depths of the unknown regarding the ultimate fate of humanity and life in the Universe. Man's survival instinct is one of the strongest driving forces present today, and Interstellar certainly displays the extent of its potential. Time is of the essence, and every second counts when it could be over a year long, literally. From the initial set surrounding a barren Earth quickly crumbling to the ends of space as we know it (or don't), this movie travels through both space and time trying to find a solution. A solution unknown, but a solution nonetheless. Imagination is a skill people seldom use or trivialize more often than not. The opportunity to go above and beyond, to not fear the Universe's infinite possibilities but to rather understand it, is one of mankind's greatest achievements and ongoing goals. Interstellar presents a sharp and worthwhile outlook on the world, and how the Universe works in mysterious, unimaginable ways.",10,3,9,9 November 2014
Oblivion," A True Sci-Fi Film
","Science fiction films are often under-appreciated because viewers often forget to watch the movies with an open mind. 'Oblivion' is a story with contemporary resonance as the themes of artificial intelligence and extraterrestrial life are prominent within society today. As these are two highly speculated areas in the world, it is easy for viewers to visualize and relate to the transformation the Earth has undergone in 'Oblivion'. This movie is filled with action in a devastated Earth that is now inhabitable. It is with this simple premise that the writers of 'Oblivion' create a captivating story of a man on a mission to seek answers. Although 'Oblivion' has an amazing plot, there are clear reasons why this movie has received low scores from critics. Firstly, most of the cast were not suitable playing their parts. Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman are great in their respective roles, but with the exception of a few minor people, the actors and actresses don't appear to be fit for their characters. Also, the movie had a great background story but the writers did not fully capitalize in delivering the story since it was troublesome to follow at times, and there was more that could have been done with the script. And at 124 minutes long, this movie could have deleted unnecessary scenes which could have focused on the main message. Without providing too much information, there were scenes of pure boredom that could have been altered in such a way to further explain the events of the war and the characters' stories to help the audience better understand the events occurring.With a lot of untapped potential and poor acting, the movie does deserve the mediocre rating critics have given it. Nonetheless, with the superb story and adventurous journey filmed, I would highly recommend 'Oblivion' to any person with an open mind. This movie will provoke you to think and question the world around us, and that is why it deserves an 8 out of 10 despite its flaws.",5,2,7,21 July 2013
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Make life a little brighter
","War brings out the worst in mankind. But in the midst of chaos, look for the helpers.Adrian Cronauer is this type of person. With no real good or bad side, it's hard to decipher strangers' true colours. Regardless of warfare, Mr. Cronauer simply tries to remind people of their humanity. To remind them of better times. To remind them of the laughs and joy any person can share with another.Truly understanding both sides is the greatest battle. Bringing to light the truth that is too often silenced and progressing together instead of dominating is a solution rarely sought. Remember that war is seldom fought by the ones who actually started it. To stop it is imperative. To endure it is even harder. Nonetheless, Adrian Cronauer tries.",7,2,3,22 February 2015
The Thing," Undeniable ends
","The Thing is certainly a creature to fear. Its transformation capabilities yield it one of the strangest yet most powerful weapons introduced to the horror genre. The vulnerability of a population of any size certainly makes the Thing a being with infinite (chaotic) potential and one to hold in high regard.From the eerie soundtrack to sharp moments, The Thing certainly has the inner workings of a classic. Despite the great technical qualities, I was generally unmoved by the film. Although the oddity and atmosphere in the Antarctic was entertaining throughout, it was rather dull than pure excitement.The haunting and supernatural plot combined with the scary scenes and chilling vibrations surrounding every movement ensure a moment should not be missed. But alas, it was simply not a movie for me.",5,4,7,26 October 2014
The Village," Let's play a game
","There are different types of horror films one can imagine. Some may immediately think of The Exorcist, while others may consider films similar to Spoorloos the subtlest yet scariest of them all. Whatever your preference, The Village is unsettling in more than one regard. From the disturbing happenings in the beginning, this movie constantly questions your understanding of the environment. You are initially introduced to this secluded land much like the other villagers, and only know what you've been told. Therefore, it's a mystery you are unravelling as the different characters begin to reveal more and more of themselves. To figure out what's going on, if anything, you'll just have to watch this film. Playing the The Village was certainly a lot of fun and I'd highly recommend it to anyone curious enough. It makes you question how much you know of your surroundings, which unfortunately, we often know little about. We often take others' words for granted, but sometimes it's best to think a little and figure things out on your own.",7,0,0,8 April 2016
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," No One is Innocent
","Innocence is a state we presume until further conviction, and for good reason. This notion of initial innocence is troubling in convoluted situations and potentially blinds us, though. Being afraid to question or inconvenience others is an act of courtesy and cooperation, but failure to do what's needed can also have dire consequences. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has some intricate characters with a great selection in cast. From the elusive Lisbeth to the spiteful Vanger family, the character growth and background surrounding each and every individual is intriguing. Not only are the actors and actresses strong in their respective roles, but the overall environment and atmosphere produced by each particular setting emphasizes the mystery and eeriness involved in every step that may be your last.The detective work and plot development was interesting (though not necessarily new), but the cast making their parts unique and truly special makes this film one to watch. Immersing the viewer is one of the greatest achievements in film.",8,0,2,2 November 2014
Jarhead," The hands never forget
","Jarhead moved me on a personal level since it displays the life of a boy whom enlisted unaware of his future duties, of the wars being fought, and of the consequences it had on all those around them. From the wandering horse to innocent bystanders, everyone is affected (unfortunately for the worst, usually) and Jarhead shows the significant role each person plays despite the overwhelming circumstances. From the branding to chants, tradition and solidarity is still alive, but what does it stand for? Whether it's people running away from problems, trying to find meaning, living out their dreams or just simply trying to pay bills, every Jarhead has a story that's unique to themselves. Even after their deployment finishes, life never quite returns to its original normalcy. I particularly enjoyed the camera crew scenes and breakdown of daily routines since it details how average soldiers really are. No one is truly fighting with each others; only secular groups (instigated by those in higher power) and 'appointed' officials that yield the masses. These people's attitudes are not intrinsic to the person, but rather the situation.Although the plot wasn't phenomenal nor the peripheral cast great, the overall movie was solid. From beginning to end, we see how the innocent boy we start with is now forever a Jarhead.",6,2,3,7 September 2014
Now You See Me," Good story, poor acting
","I am genuinely a fan of movies that play with magic. The Prestige and The Illusionist are among my favourites, and I believe their strong plots and my childish imagination make these movies seem magical to me. Although Now You See Me is more of a theatrical act for contemporary audiences, the one category this movie completely fails in is acting. The magicians themselves are fairly amiable. You have Jack, the humble boy who wants to make it big. Then you have J. and Henley, who have some kind of relationship going, but that is all but disturbed by Merrit, the old pervert with a good sense of humour. Now don't get me wrong, this movie was quite amusing and funny at times. But at others (especially in emotional scenes), I felt like cardboard could have had more expression. The acting from the detectives was generally dull, and even when there was a fair bit of tension, it just felt too insincere. I am glad nonetheless for watching this movie, as I was entertained for the whole duration. Just make sure you enjoy the movie, and don't look too closely (you'll understand).",6,0,3,25 August 2013
American History X," More Than Just A Movie
","Watching movies has evolved into a passion of mine since I just regularly watched them for entertainment. In the past, I would simply turn the television on, pop a CD and watch for about two hours. This no longer happens.American History X is a truly wonderful film. It offers thought provoking discussions, an emotional plot and a story we can all learn lessons from. Over the years, watching movies as a hobby has transformed into a learning experience--one where the viewer is a student who witnesses the events transpiring. As the students, you start to see American History X is more than a single class where insolent children have catharsis; it's a place of growth where boys become men. People argue that you never really value something until you feel pain like the characters in this movie. The relationship issues, pursuit for happiness, thoughts of loneliness and anger that builds up inside are emotions we all feel. Maybe we never actually do realize the importance of others and the values we hold until a traumatic event occurs, but this movie certainly comes close.",10,1,2,14 September 2013
Gone with the Wind," From middle to end, a great film
","I've never felt so divided about a film before.On the one end I admire its brutal depiction of love and its realities in real (i.e. flawed) people, yet its unnecessarily lengthy beginning combined with arguably poor dialogue at times made it hard to stay focused particularly in the beginning once again. But as the film rolled on, it evolved into a film I began to love. I just wished it could've started sooner and could've been consistently there.Olivia de Havilland and Clark Gable and Butterfly McQueen are perfect in their roles. And there are great moments throughout the rest of the film especially involving Leslie Howard. While I wish there were certain aspects of the film that could be changed, it is the way it is, and it's a damn good film as it progresses.",7,0,0,28 March 2020
The Butterfly Effect," Chaos Theory
","Life is unpredictable. The very stroke of a pen, random smile you glance upon, or even the flutter of a butterfly's wings can completely alter the future. Often we try to play God, but the reoccurring theme is that it's futile.The Butterfly Effect is an exceptionally beautiful movie since it eloquently outlines the persistence of man to continually search for the 'perfect' change despite constant failures. Humans work tirelessly for goals yet don't quite realize when it's time to let nature run its course. It's hard to accept we are inadequate; it's even harder to let something we love go. The Butterfly Effect is: thrilling, endearing, lively, romantic, disturbing and thought-provoking all simultaneously. It's a film that explores the boundaries on psychiatry and misunderstanding, phenomenology and free will, and is one that will undoubtedly impress.",10,2,4,26 May 2014
Frozen," The Warmth of Winter
","Trying to keep yourself away from a loved one is hard, especially when you're doing it for their best interest. Even more so when they are unaware of why you are causing this pain upon them. Elsa has to give up countless memories and cherished moments, and must live in isolation from her sister despite being siblings in the same household. They both have to live a deprived childhood for each other's sake due to Elsa's extraordinary yet dangerous powers. With all the loneliness and death that surrounds them, it's astonishing at how positive they can still be. Anna's still vibrant and both sisters desperately want to spend time together again, but don't know how. It's only a long and arduous trek in arctic conditions that appears to be Anna's final hope after a cold childhood. Watching this movie was definitely an enjoyable experience. Despite all the hardships the sisters encountered, I couldn't help but be happy. Regardless of the weather or events transpiring around them, we see there is strength in love. That nothing can break family. I honestly can't remember watching a movie in which I smiled so much--inside and out.",8,1,2,23 February 2014
22 Jump Street," More of the same
","22 Jump Street had few funny moments and a similar storyline to its prequel, but that's about it. With subpar acting, weak plot and somewhat bland comedy, the second instalment has much to improve upon.This film recasts familiar faces with Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum as costars. As their bromance is tenuous in the new world of college, they begin to undergo changes. Watching this movie was exciting at times and a bore at others. With good scenes scattered seldom among the rest, I did not enjoy this movie as much as I had hoped. The jokes were common and action was numbing. Although this movie has been featured throughout the summer as a hit, it is a miss. Hopefully future instalments will try to be more original.",5,15,36,25 August 2014
Amadeus," An Incredible Challenge
","Perfection is a feat often sought but rarely attained (perhaps never, some say). Antonio Salieri, the man who never was Mozart, recounts his life and the great influence this peculiar man named Amadeus had on his entirety. From Salieri's outlandish dreams to royal career, Mozart's ingenuity eluded him and he could never quite figure out 'how?'For such an eventful and studied life, Mozart certainly endured a lot despite having all the talent in the world. Skill was never a question, but showcasing and having others comprehend his beauty at the time often was. Salieri, despite his best (and vile) efforts, never approaches the perfection Mozart produced at a whim. To create perfection so easily is the great struggle that haunts him to this day. But maybe perfection is never truly the goal. This extraordinary biopic is as entertaining as they come. Whether for the great score, pleasant acting or overall story that will live forever, Amadeus is certainly a tale to tell.",7,0,1,4 January 2015
The Game," What do you give a man whom has everything?
","Our lives are full of memories—some we strive for again, some we try to repress. We often say we're glad the way life has panned out, and then again, wonder: what would have happened? With so many possibilities in life, why not wander and explore? Play a game, perhaps? Life is not all fun (subjectively speaking) but it is certainly a game we don't expect. Perspective is a strong trait we could all use, since insight always helps—though it may come at a cost. From the unusual start to the incumbent end, we often wish to go back to earlier times. To not agree to terms unknown. To enjoy the peace that exists in simply being. But it's not enough. Insatiable curiosity is the greatest quality we have, yet also our greatest flaw. From all the materialistic glamour in the world to the virtues we try to emulate, there is much to both search and cradle in this Universe, and also to learn from. Nicholas van Orton has encountered life-altering moments starting from his childhood up to the ever-changing present. Nonetheless, there is always a void. One we hope to fill.",8,0,2,19 October 2014
The Illusionist," A Magical Story
","A magician's trick is his alibi, his lure, his identity. At a young age, all Eisenheim(Edward Norton) wanted to do was disappear with his love, Sophie(Jessica Biel). The two were from different casts but did not care for social differences, yet the aristocrats interfered with their relationship and broke them apart, leaving their love forever unfulfilled...The Illusionist is a fantastic film that not only displays the genuine love between two destined individuals, but brings viewers on a journey which reveals the depths of it. Although this movie is fictional, it is the plot and imagery that gives The Illusionist its sheer beauty. Everyone has a love for magic deep within them. Some grow out of it at an early age while others continue their passion. Whether Eisenheim practices magic primarily due to his love for the art or for Sophie is subject to debate, but he certainly demonstrates the true power of his heart.Viewers can argue about the validity of various details and the discrepancies of the plot with the time frame, but regardless of any inaccuracies, the true meaning of The Illusionist is found in its core - the story. This tale about a man and a woman keeping their spark alive through the most difficult of times is a beautiful one that deviates from the standard mold of contemporary romance, and shows that love is magical.",8,1,2,25 June 2013
Donnie Brasco," Relating with the mafia
","As an undercover officer, staying in disguise often entails becoming one of the criminals. Donnie Brasco offers this unique perspective, and sheds light on the relatable aspects of life in the mafia as he appears to be more criminal than cop.This movie was excellent. Enthralling viewers from the beginning with a view of the daily life in the mob to how operations work; this film is truly a testament to good cinema since it reveals a part of crime life that many people seem not to understand. From holidays to heists, this movie captures the essence of what it means to be a mafioso, and how one is affected from an emotional and physical standpoint. The casting in Donnie Brasco is terrific. With Al Pacino once again delivering as a patron and Johnny Depp playing the protégé, the pair in crime manage to grab viewers' hearts all the while committing murders and other foul acts. This movie, being based on the true story of Joseph D. Pistone, is one of the greater mafia movies, and is one that I highly recommend.",7,0,0,7 July 2013
Mulholland Drive," Don't mix dreams for reality
","Fantasies play a large but sometimes secretive role in our lives. Imagination is so strong we become blinded by it at times, and it can certainly make for an entertaining story.Mullholland Dr. is a series of inconclusive scenes—starting from the elusive opening to the realization that we can't run from our demons. Whether it's for the unique perspective or thick plot, this film will definitely entertain and challenge viewers. Although this film has a lot of great features, the acting and development at various points of the movie were both lacklustre. The oddity and stark change in emotions of the characters was also incredulous. It arguably adds to the entire mystery, but pulls away from the viewing experience and makes the story feel forced. Lynch is certainly a great director with tricks up his sleeves, but playing them all at once and in poor combination convolutes the story unnecessarily. Surrealism is best when uncultured, but this movie tries to encapsulate different premises and then head a completely contrived direction afterwards. Not a bad idea itself, but execution is key. It is certainly a film worth watching even if just for the interesting perspective, but flaws throughout Mulholland Dr. make it difficult to enjoy.",3,1,6,16 November 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," Funny & Co.
","Despite all the high appraisal or hype for GotG, I never fully accepted it to be that great. Marvel has produced quite a few entertaining movies recently and I'd group this one closely together with Captain America 2 or Iron Man. Although it's not purely comedy or action, GotG combines these two genres beautifully making the entire watch entertaining. The comedic scenes went along very well with this movie--funnily lifting spirits after dark(er) moments. Not expecting it to be dramatic, it was fairly deep (though easy to follow along). Not extremely thought-provoking but emotional. GotG was a pleasant surprise for me. With previously subpar expectations, I will admit that I was either smiling, laughing or somewhat intrigued at any one frame in the movie. A classic from Marvel that I greatly enjoyed.",8,2,6,3 August 2014
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Classic Tarantino
","Action and Tarantino are essentially synonymous. You can be certain that Kill Bill: Vol. 1 has a lot of fighting and adventure in nearly every scene, even when you least expect it. Waking up out of a coma for years is an immense task for anyone. Waking up out of a coma for years and then going on a rampage to seek revenge is superhuman. We follow the journey of an ill-fated woman in Kill Bill, known as the Bride, who lost everything on her wedding day including her husband, her unborn child and herself (almost). Killing people is not easy. Killing assassins...well, let Tarantino explain that. Although I love Tarantino and his unique style, there were definitely moments where the filming was just not up to par with the rest of his works. The Bride is definitely an interesting character with a rich and mysterious past that we, as viewers, are constantly trying to puzzle together. The enigmatic theme surrounding this film definitely adds to its suspense as well. With all this taken into consideration, I would have to say that Tarantino made a fine action film. Overall, Kill Bill is a solid movie. If you're looking for a fun film and want to fill the next two hours of your life with intense yet comical fighting, this is the movie for you.",5,1,3,24 November 2013
From Dusk Till Dawn," It simply lacks
","After hearing about the cast and past reviews for this movie, I decided to give it a shot. I'm a fan of horror, but please don't think this is designed to scare. It merely employs poor costumes and CGI to make disfigured vampires whom are a bigger nuisance than threat to kill. The acting was also some of the worst I had seen. This film felt endless (in terms of duration). I was completely disappointed. Aside from the good introduction that is Pulp Fiction-esque, the entire movie is monotonous. From the lacklustre plot to the boredom of terrible comedy (not even laughable as anti-jokes), this movie lacks in nearly every department. As a cult film, I hope some out there enjoy it, since it managed to bore me for nearly two hours (in real time) and I was excited to watch it. I would highly advise against watching this movie. Whether you want to catch up on sleep or are simply trying to kill time, this movie is not the way to go.",1,11,22,14 September 2014
Black Hawk Down," Fate of war
","Black Hawk Down, based on true events, depicts the world's combat against ruthless leaders that oppress their nations. When fighting overseas, especially on a 'peace' mission, it is imperative bloodshed is kept to a minimum. This film portrays well how that is not always the case. War is not a tool for effective problem-solving, nor will it ever be, and this movie outlines the trials soldiers face. War films don't always capture the true essence of fighting; the lives lost on both frontiers. One impactful and important aspect incorporated into Black Hawk Down is that it emphasizes civilian rights and how common people are the ones taken advantage of. Whether they are innocent bystanders shot in gunfights, starved to death by merciless dictators or have their children abducted from them, they are the ones who ultimately suffer. It is their participation, or lack thereof, that makes this movie as strong as it is.Although Black Hawk Down demonstrates the scope of war and combat involved, this is rather superficial and lacks any true entertainment value beyond long gunfights and shooting. It fails to develop the true story of the militants and soldiers and exceedingly exaggerates the plot line. It appears to be one-dimensional in this regard. The movie even dismisses the fact prisoners were captured and does not delve into this topic at all. Black Hawk Down is also unsuccessful in realistically illustrating the events and does not properly acknowledge other countries, ulterior motives for the Americans' ill-advised actions, and is fairly propagandized.War movies depicting real events have to stay true to the story and pay tribute to all involved and the events they actually endured. Black Hawk Down is too theatrical and employs unnecessary (and fabricated) plot to an otherwise memorable day. Nonetheless, war movies are not documentaries displaying true events nor should they be mistaken as one. That's why they are fictional movies and only that. Regardless of the interpretation, Black Hawk Down lacks the solid execution for an originally genuine and good plot, which is why I give it a 4/10.",5,1,6,6 April 2014
2001: A Space Odyssey," Changing Times
","Venturing into space is a dream many of us earthlings have starting from our childhoods. The exhilaration of leaving our atmosphere and wandering in the deep darkness, that is our Universe, in complete silence and serenity is a vivid imagination that we all have that almost seems surreal. Yet foreseeing the proper methods and precautions of space travel with certainty is impossible, and sometimes things don't always go as planned. 2001: A Space Odyssey contains relatively short dialogue compared to today's films. A lot of the scenes involves grand imagery and the tale is being told through mute skits. When you look at the overall picture of this film, it's hard to pinpoint any exact focus or direction for this movie. The two common aims that can be deciphered is the search for discovery and a curiosity for exploration. From the apes conquering each other with weapons for the first time to an expedition to Jupiter to look for extraterrestrial life; this entire movie involves seeking for a greater purpose. A Space Odyssey is very aesthetically pleasing and far ahead of its time. Throughout the entire film, you will be in awe of the tremendous scenery and epic soundtrack accompanying the great journey you're about to witness. Kubrick certainly accomplished creating a philosophical masterpiece with 2001 and it should be watched by all who are open-minded and prepared for an adventure.",5,0,2,4 November 2013
Life Is Beautiful," Foreign at its finest
","Sensitive topics such as World War 2 are generally portrayed in their classical sense, where the life of various individuals in either Concentration Camps or battlefields are exposed. Not that there is anything wrong with this, but Life is Beautiful manages to tell the tale of two lovers and their family, and how the War will never dampen their spirits.With the Jewish people being primary targets in the Holocaust, this foreign film displays how true love cannot be broken by the evilest of atrocities, despite race or religion. Happiness is rather difficult to attain, especially for prisoners who are near death, but Life is Beautiful succeeds in demonstrating that a light of hope can shine a dark room. This movie deserves as much praise and accolades than any other. With great acting, starting from the stars to support, Life is Beautiful encompasses the attributes every great movie should. The emotional plot, filled with comical satire, is a cinema any move critic would enjoy. With Italian films being known for their romance and passion, Life is Beautiful should be remembered for being able to reproduce these same qualities in a setting where tomorrow is not always certain.",10,1,1,16 June 2013
The Hurricane," Authority
","In a case with multiple sides, it's hard to seek the truth. It's especially difficult when men purposely play with the system. Whether it's 'indisputable' evidence, false witnesses or sheer manipulation, the story of the Hurricane is one to be remembered. Known as a prominent fighter, Hurricane's battle with overcoming challenges began from an early age. This film is deeply emotional. It delves into the ploy of sinister men in positions of power who have goals besides enforcing the spirit of the law. The Hurricane is unluckily swept into the midst of corruption and loses everything. It's a struggle to one day taste freedom and bring justice back to the courts.The Hurricane is a strong movie. Whether it's the psychological trouble or loss of family, it's impossible to not sympathize with the protagonist. Although not truly meant to be a documentary, my main concern is that the film is clearly one-sided. Although it is a great piece of film, the plot does not represent history accurately and only reveals light from a skewed perspective. With great performances from Denzel Washington and the entire supporting cast, this movie is certain to please for its entertainment value. Validity is key, though. Corruption is rampant, but so is deception.",5,0,0,8 June 2014
A Clockwork Orange," Full Circle
","Often times, films depict a character and his ardour. A Clockwork Orange has a crafty lead in Alex who is as dynamic and vibrant as any. This movie is definitely creative and provides an original theme uncommon in most modern movies. It's the gait of the delinquents, diction of the characters, structure of society and underlying themes in this movie that make it such a spectacle. A Clockwork Orange is sinister. From the initial acts of the four to the events of Alex's life, the entire film revolves around the theme of 'an eye for an eye.' Committing criminal acts, remorseless to the innocent and weak and pure disregard for the future is what life is like for the boys in the beginning. As time progresses, it is evident Alex is, by nature, looking for excitements and finds it in violence. A Clockwork Orange literally displays that people can only, to a certain extent, be changed at the core level. Despite advanced psychological treatments, a criminal who does not choose to change will not. A reason people love this film is because of the sharp contrast it has to most contemporary movies. Rarely do you see such an adventurous yet negligent person who has wits but chooses to exploit others with it. This film is definitely worth the watch since it will leave you on the edge of your seat always awaiting for Alex's next move...",7,1,4,13 November 2013
Titanic," A Story To Tell
","Rarely does a story so well known by viewers surprise them so wonderfully. Everyone knows about the Titanic and the travesty that transpired, but people often forget about the lives of those involved and the experiences they endured. The story of the Titanic, the infamous ship, and two starstruck lovers, who were merely forgotten, displays vast beauty in an otherwise unfortunate event. From the characters to scenery, this movie captivates the audience with its enthralling imagery and emotional acting. Stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet perform incredibly in their respective roles, and demonstrate that going against the status quo is not necessarily bad. Throughout the film, viewers are taken on a journey. One that begins with Rose happily accepting Jack into her life, and then Jack tirelessly trying to stay in it. To say Titanic is a romance is an understatement. It possesses action, adventure, drama and all the like, and is far from your generic love movie. I was gladly surprised by how much I loved this film even after seeing its numerous awards and superb reviews. Titanic is a movie that will certainly not disappoint, and it is definitely one for the ages that I recommend for anyone and everyone to see.",9,3,4,28 July 2013
Edge of Tomorrow," Time for Attack
","Analysts and scientists alike wonder if the Earth is equipped to handle an alien invasion. The Edge of Tomorrow certainly features futuristic warfare and details how complex attacks can be and the vulnerability of the world. This film is a good action flick. It outlines the continuing struggle of a man who endures a seemingly hopeless cause every day. With an intricate alien opposition, the human race is outwitted. The extraterrestrials appear to be infallible and Edge of Tomorrow is an entertaining movie from start to finish, My main problems with this movie were some key plot points. Whether it be the time-stopping powers mysteriously exchanged into human blood or the somewhat random ending, this film has some intrinsic flaws that remain unexplained. Whether you're looking for a pure action movie with emotions on high or even just something to pass time, Edge of Tomorrow will surely entertain. 5/10",5,1,6,15 June 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," The End
","The Hobbit trilogy has certainly been a level below its predecessor: The Lord of the Rings (it is actually the sequel chronologically). It's the series that lingered on a little too long and ultimately failed to bring the same magic the original films did. The Battle of the Five Armies finally put an end to it all. After a tumultuous battle with Smaug, it's the inevitable fight for good to keep peace on Middle Earth. One of the best parts of this movie were the fight scenes. With that being said, it was also one of the worst. With extremely long and seldom entertaining fights that we've become used to watching, I'm glad to say it's finally over. It was the grand journey Frodo and Sam led that initially kindled my fascination with Tolkien's translated work. I wished I could have enjoyed these cinematic pieces as much as the first three, but I simply didn't.",5,3,7,16 February 2015
Lord of War," Blind Eye
","Whether it's the meat industry, child slavery or even racism, these are all modern day outrages widely present in society. Yet, people don't regularly stand up to these injustices since life is too comfortable, and that's the internal moral conflict Yuri Orlov fights. Always feeling inferior his entire life, he begins profiteering from trafficking weapons to build a sense of worth. Most people would find this ethically unacceptable since you are providing arms for ruthless dictators and causing the deaths of millions of innocent civilians. Especially because it is just for monetary benefits. I will honestly say Nicholas Cage is not my favourite actor. I must also add that he performed exceptionally in this film, and that he definitely pulled Lord of War together. It's surprisingly revealing to see how the world revolves around money, and how people will act superficially in the face of controversy. Money equates to power, and this unfortunate truth represents how isolated we are from others. This movie certainly offers a unique perspective with regards to warfare, and offers a viewpoint most contemporary war movies don't. Regularly, war veterans are glorified and combat is shone in a bright light. The reason I enjoyed this movie so much was because it demonstrates how warfare can affect relationships and completely transform your sense of the world. One of Yuri's primary arguments for his abhorrent work is that if he didn't do it, someone else would, and he would lose money out of it. Similar to other problems across the globe, the main reason why atrocities still occur is because people are passive and unwilling to risk their comfort for the sacred life of others. It is for exposing this side of war that I truly loved Lord of War.",7,0,1,29 December 2013
The Shawshank Redemption," Welcome to Shawshank
","Going to prison is never easy and almost an unimaginable experience for most people. It's even worse if you are sentenced for fifty years despite being innocent. Shawshank Redemption is an incredible movie. Not only because of its fantastic narration and storytelling technique. Not only because of the emotional yet inspirational performances put on by each and every actor/actress. Not even the spectacular filming and perfect settings. No, what makes Shawshank Redemption a truly excellent film is the complete story and the very relatable tale that is the life of Andy Dufresne.This movie focuses on the lives of minor characters, life in and out of prison, and how the system has changed so many men and women drastically. And it's these individual stories that make Andy's even more special. He was able to stay strong, to manage without friends or support in the worst times. He was a man no one would have looked at twice. No one special. Just another person like you and me. Yet, his story is one that we can all imagine ourselves in. Where bad circumstances meet inexplicable motives, and it's being capable of imagining ourselves in Andy's shoes that makes Shawshank Redemption such a beautiful movie.This movie stands for a lot of things. Love, respect, peace and friendship among other things. More so than the rest, Shawshank Redemption is a story about hope. Having faith in the future, secretly knowing good will overcome bad.No one knows what our future holds. But if we could all live like Andy, optimistic and ever so kind in the most dire of situations, holding up true justice, this world would be a better place.",10,0,0,5 August 2013
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Lose one sense, gain another
","Perception is a difficult trait to assess. Sometimes it truly is hard to comprehend another person's viewpoint, while at times it's simply exaggerated. Birdman is Riggan's egocentric persona, or so it appears. A man who lives without identity--who only remembers a false sense of worth when he was in the tabloids--clings on to Birdman to stay relevant. It's a major psychological movement to realize the world does not revolve around you (for some) since it's on this path we call life that we try to add some worth.Edward Norton and Emma Stone performed exceptionally in this film and really provided a great punch. Their stories and otherwise daring demeanours ensured every minute was a stimulating one. The overall story is of the contemporary existential crisis, and how identity is such an allusive topic at times, even to ourselves. It's the moulding of our fate (or lack thereof) that many struggle to accept, and Birdman does a great job in showing different outlooks on life.At times we have a false perception of ourselves. This may appear as a distorted reality to some or a safeguard for others' egos. Nonetheless, it is this sense of understanding and self-acceptance Birdman struggles with that leads to peace.",8,1,7,1 February 2015
Trainspotting," Grip of the Past
","Escaping the present and living a life free from our past is a task many dream of. Renton, a drug addict who's constantly encircled by his friends, attempts to change his life on multiple occasions but always retrogrades. Coming clean cold turkey is evidently easier said than done. Drugs and the lifestyle of an addict are a dangerous combination. Although Renton and his mates appear free and in their own world, they are unaware of the dangers they put themselves in. Going through each day as an adventure is fun but putting your life at stake each time for such little reward is futile. This is a realization Renton slowly makes. Everyone goes through rough patches but these boys seem to hit it all. Prison, death, sickness and emotional breakdowns are just some of their problems that seem to never fade away. Not always so obvious, getting away from life isn't so easy.Over time, the boys evolve like any young men. Some proceed to stronger drugs while others try to get their act together. Regardless of their intentions, it is apparent the boys' pasts always catch up with them. All they can do is try and lead the lives they want; no one should expect anything more.",6,1,3,11 May 2014
The Sixth Sense," The Value of Life
","When I first heard about The Sixth Sense, I imagined a movie that deals with the terrifying side of the paranormal. What I didn't expect was the unusually interesting relationship between a young child and man who are going through troubles in their respective lives. Everyone goes through problems, so it's nice to see people trying to overcome such large ones.If you're looking for a strictly horror movie, this is not the flick. I'm sure you can find haunted kids in The Shining or Insidious. The Sixth Sense goes beyond the average thriller since it deals with the supernatural and romance (which some may argue are not two entirely independent themes). I must say that I was happily surprised with this movie. It did start quite slowly but built a strong story gradually that really gets emotional. Rarely does a movie combine aspects of such contrast so effectively, but do in part to the solid acting, this movie certainly delivers a unique twist. All in all, The Sixth Sense was a terrific movie. The whole plot was carefully constructed and managed to turn a common mystery into a life lesson.",9,0,0,22 September 2013
The Truman Show," Life in a box
","How would you ever convince yourself you're living in an artificial world when literally everyone else, even your significant other and childhood friends, are fooling you? It's a terrifying thought to think you are constantly being monitored and purposely manipulated without cognizance. Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is just an average person (well not really) being watched by the entire world since his birth. Unaware of the world that exists outside of Seahaven, it's sad to consider a man with such genuine and adventurous dreams being limited in his life because of money. Having your life televised is one thing, but doing it without informed consent and only deceit and trickery is the primary reason this film strikes chords with people. It's a generally accepted view that beings should have the right to do with their lives as they wish. This fundamental freedom is taken away from an innocent person whose only mishap was being born to parents that didn't want him!Growing up in modern society, it is well known that we tend to take things for granted. Whether you're living in a closed dome or restricted by the government, freedom to choose is one of the most innate yet exploited aspects of society. It's an unnerving thought but maybe we are all living in a closed environment, playing the pawns; we just don't realize it.",8,0,1,17 November 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," The Good, The Bad..,
","Watching this film, I was polarized. There were moments I really enjoyed and scenes I wished were rather not kept. As the second instalment in the 4-part series, Catching Fire will pique your interest in the very beginning (literally). As the movie continues, however, dullness from the acting and rather weak plot elements really begin to tear the movie down.The awkwardness and sheer lack of emotion from some of the characters in select scenes may have been for 'theatrical effect,' but it really withdrew from the film. Discussions were shallow and common ploys like that seen in the first instalment left me unimpressed with the first few scenes. As the movie progressed, though, the story began to pick up and whether it's the twists or the games itself, things certainly were entertaining. My main critique is for the below-average initial forty minutes of Catching Fire. Apart from the very first scene, the rather weak storyline and acting was uninteresting to say the least until the Quarter Quell begins.Without spoiling too much, watch till the end. As more plot unfolds, the true games begin. Hopefully the sequel picks up where this one ended.",5,3,7,17 August 2014
Godzilla," Great beginning...
","There is so much unknown in this Universe. As a civilization, we are capable of observing phenomena light years away yet barely know what's under our feet. With rather peculiar yet impactful trembles of unknown origin near nuclear reactors in Japan, lives are lost, the region is evacuated and people's lives are turned upside down. This is no simple matter. Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) realizes the dismissal of quite disturbing events that are apocalyptic in nature and works extensively to prevent another catastrophe. Being the only individual privy to sensational information (i.e. immediately ominous futures), it's hard to fully convince others you are sane. With the stage set for a man to challenge society's greatest conflict, Godzilla is sure to impress...but it falls short. Whether it's the human-helping Godzilla, cliché reunions or poor dialogue, this film starts strong but deteriorates afterwards. What begins as an interesting scientific investigation results in an effort of the world (Americans more specifically) fighting to restore balance. The build-up of an intriguing inquiry of a man who lost everything ends up in a shallow battle.I must say I was excited watching Godzilla but was sadly disappointed as the movie progressed.",3,3,9,16 May 2014
A Walk to Remember," A Flurry of Emotions
","A Walk to Remember is certainly a tearjerker. Whether it's the moving performance from Mandy Moore or the connection found between Landon and Jamie, there certainly is a lot of emotion involved.With that being said, there is a mixture of beautiful moments along with otherwise odd and somewhat perturbing scenes that ruin the atmosphere. From the entire beginning sequence showcasing the utter callousness of a few people to the lengthy singing scene, the buildup was poorly executed. The entire relationship with Landon's father was unbelievable as well and now he suddenly has unfounded ambitions for medical school. The poor combination of romance and entertainment at times is simply off-putting.Nonetheless, this certainly is a good romance. An overall poor film, but the strong leads will get emotions running.",5,0,1,25 January 2015
Moon," In-validity in cloning
","Cloning is a rising phenomenon in modern society. From a microscopic level using bacteria to macroscopic ranges where entire mammals are fully cloned. Often the biological implications of these experiments are closely monitored, but not the actual psychological effects. With the hopes of returning to your family after a three-year hardship of not only laborious work, but also isolation, two weeks until returning home is a journey that seems like a lifetime. Although what if that return never happened? If it was all a complete lie? It is haunting to implant memories and experiences into a person's mind and then restrict them from all tangible parts of that life. It is slavery. An act that no one deserves to endure. Moon delves into the concept of autonomy and essential rights, and offers a unique perspective on an otherwise untouched subject. Cloning happens everyday and it's only time until it reaches one of us. Once that day comes, there is no difference between the clone and 'original'; we are one.Whether cognizant or not, onus for equality and morality lies on those that do.",8,1,3,21 September 2014
Her," Artificial Consciousness
","To just say this movie is a romantic comedy is an understatement. From the beginning, we meet a man who has loved but has lost what he once had. He's not the same and his friends know he is not coping well being single. After purchasing a new operating system, he finds companionship--solace--in an entity that he cannot really fathom. He tries to build relationships and become intimate with other women after his separation with his wife, but after all he's endured, it just doesn't seem real anymore. An OS, built to simulate and interact like a conscious being, that evolves like normal human minds, is indistinguishable from a real person. It's radical to call it living, but it's heartless to call it just a machine. We reason that it is just built in the coding; prewired to act this way. And there are obvious differences between us and the operating systems. We are mortal, can bear physical pain, express natural emotions and have biological parents. Is this essence of being a human, though? What if we can or cannot live forever. Numerous species and even prior to the industrial revolution, human lifetimes were considerably shorter to what they are today. Yet there are organisms that can circumvent death by natural causes. We have essentially doubled our lifespans in a few centuries, and in the future, it is difficult to predict how we will progress. But whether it's knowing that we have an ultimate fate of returning to the Earth or knowing that we can be switched off without notice, we all share a feeling of vulnerability and insecurity, something we try to cope with by interacting with others. Who is to limit the capacity to an afterlife? Where maybe one day we can all go. Also, we all learn from our surroundings, an OS just does it more rapidly. To say our emotions are genuine while an operating system's are artificial is inconsiderate, since we are a product of our environments, and all our expressions are due to our development since conception. Whether we are made of wires or neural circuitry, at the most fundamental level, we are both just active chemical processes that proceed in a direction partly governed by our experiences. Whether it's feeling pain--which countless people cannot due to personal injuries/diseases--or if it's being the offspring of two parents--in vitro fertilization is raising in popularity--neither can deny an individual of the freedom to be considered living. Why do we impose this restriction on an OS, then? Operating systems are highly intellectual and sentient. Is it murder to turn disconnect them like we do with patients who are 'brain dead' and can no longer process information despite maintaining autonomic activity? To say an OS is fake is superficial. To say an OS cannot share in love is condescending. Who are we to impose restrictions on entities that can feel emotions, engage in experiences and be fully aware of the world? Who are we to impose restrictions on anyone at all?I highly recommend watching Her. It's not just a romantic comedy, it's an adventure to find love in despair, and to perhaps fulfil ourselves and bring meaning to our lives.",10,2,5,11 January 2014
V for Vendetta," Secrecy of Oppression
","Freedom is a right of every person, yet it's a highly valuable commodity in scarcity today. Surveillance can be outright blatant (e.g. with strict curfews) but can also be secretive. The futility in all of this is that the public's expressions may be silenced, and freedom abolished. Not only does this decrease our quality of life, but it leads to the population living in fear.V for Vendetta has a lot to offer. With subtle yet strong messages implicating past, current and future trends, this film reveals the truth surveillance states face. With great screenplay and plot development, this deep movie is exciting with both action and romance from start to finish. Despite its fantasy and surreal effects, there's a very strong sense of realism. The events in this film are not so different from modern day.I truly enjoyed V for Vendetta. Although there are sequences full of unrealistic elements, the overall film is enthralling and stimulates the mind. It is one that reminds us of the duty each citizen holds. The power of an idea cannot be underestimated.",8,2,4,13 July 2014
