Changeling," A film that thrilled millions worldwide!
","Angelina Jolie in this film showed outstanding acting, Clint Eastwood deserved an Academy award for this project! The film is taunting, sad and brutal. Angelina Jolie portrays a mother who's son is kidnapped, and she does what ever it takes to find him again. Being locked up in A Mental hospital, being tricked by the police into thinking a random boy is her son. But wow, this film is just WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Angelina Jolie has many breakout scenes in this film, and watching each and every scene made me shed a tear, or rage out in anger. This is a must see!!!!!!! It takes place in the 20's - 30's and the scenery of the film is just brilliant. Everyone in this film gave it there best, that is for sure.",10,3,5,10 January 2013
In the Land of Blood and Honey," Rising Director?
","Angelina Jolie to me now, is an excellent Director, she made everybody feel this one. Its true, It's honest and real. Angelina Jolie made it a ride everybody wants to be on. What she has done here is Incredible. Its Outstanding and the Texture of this movie is Great. Although it could have been a little more Intense. The reason for me saying this is Jolie made the Honey Obvious, but the blood didn't show. However, Everybody should jump in and take sometime to watch this Outstanding Foreign film and See that Jolie made a film that will most likely be a Classic for a lot of people. Angelina Jolie is an Outstanding actress and now a Rising Director.",10,97,383,24 December 2011
