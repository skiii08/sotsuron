The Blair Witch Project," A yawn
","The only thing terrifying about this movie was how much money it made. Sure, it was inventive. It was somewhat original (to people who didn't know it had been done before...). But frightening? No way. It was atmospheric. The acting was impressive at times (edited from so much footage, it should have been!). But there wasn't a single genuine scare in the whole movie.",2,0,1,18 October 1999
