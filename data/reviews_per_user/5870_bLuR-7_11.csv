First Man," A fine balance between the epic and the intimate
","A deftly riveting film by wunderkind Damien Chazelle, First Man retells the story of NASA's first successful lunar landing mission in a way that is both epic in its scale, yet intimate in its focus. The sequences inside the space capsule are surprisingly immersive, with every thud and shudder feeling of viscerally well-earned. Gosling is perfectly cast as the taciturn Armstrong, whose stoic demeanour belies a familial tragedy that plunges him and his wife into a black hope of grief. A dizzying technical achievement. And once you land on that big rock in the sky, you'll truly be left breathless.",8,6,14,19 October 2018

Spider-Man: Homecoming," Charmingly self-effacing
","Like a breath of fresh air, Spider-Man: Homecoming recharges the constantly rebooted franchise with some much-needed levity. Spider-man is perhaps the most millennial of all superheroes in the Marvel canon, and direct Jon Watts injects enough clever humour and self-aware juvenescence into the proceedings to make it a delightful romp. It also helps that Tom Holland nails the role with charm and finesse!",7,0,0,23 January 2018
The Village," A film that stays with you
","It's difficult enough possessing a hard-to-pronounce name in Hollywood. But when you've also got a name that virtually needs no introduction, then you're in real trouble. Such is the plight of M. Night Shyamalan, the Philadelphia-bred South Indian director who was catapulted to stardom overnight with the release of his masterful ghost story 'The Sixth Sense'. So indelible was his impression on the movie-going public that half a decade later, his name alone single-handedly propelled the opening weekend of 'The Village' to a stratospheric $50 million. But just like any wunderkind who's achieved success on his first go, Shyamalan was quickly dubbed a one-trick pony who had lost his touch. His film was ripped apart in its second weekend, crumbling a hemorrhagic 67%.. enough for it to be labeled a commercial disappointment. It's truly a shame, considering 'The Village' might just be Shyamalan's most poignant and deeply moving film to date. Starring the luminous Bryce Dallas Howard in what could best be described as a revelatory performance, 'The Village' tells the plodding story of a small 19th century community isolated from the outside world by an encircling forest populated by threatening hooded creatures. While the film's premise (and particularly its preposterous climax) might wither away in the light of logical reasoning, its best pleasures are found in its small moments. The hushed midnight conversation between Howard and Joaquin Phoenix on the front porch. The strained violin soundtrack as they cross the screen in beautiful slow motion to escape the intruders. The tracking camera movement as it follows the blind Howard around the village in haunting deliberation. In the end, these images sear themselves into your mind far more intensely than the whole movie does. Call Shyamalan what you may.. a one-hit wonder, a formula-milking charlatan, or a self-deluded narcissist (see Lady in the Water), he sure knows how to direct a scene.",Null,0,0,4 April 2007
The Machinist," A dread-ful film
","No one can accuse Christian Bale of taking his profession lightly. While it's not uncommon to hear of established actors losing or gaining a few pounds for a role, Bale shocked viewers everywhere when he first appeared on screen in 2004's 'The Machinist' looking so emaciated he could squeeze through prison bars (with room to spare). His shocking 63-pound weight loss is said to be a record for any actor for a movie role. What's even more remarkable is how he quickly bulked up right afterwards to play the Caped Crusader in the following year's 'Batman Begins'. While such wild weight swinging is hardly recommendable, Bale makes the effort worthwhile by sinking his teeth so deep into his role as troubled insomniac Trevor Reznik that the mere sight of him on screen is enough to send shivers down your spine. Of course, in Brad Anderson's masterful suspense chiller, that's precisely the point. Playing the titular machinist who hasn't slept in a year, Bale's deep, hollow eye sockets and rail thin physique are the perfect foreground for Anderson's tension-filled tale of guilt, forgiveness, and ultimately, redemption. Under no circumstances a feel-good film, 'The Machinist' ratchets up the sense of dread with every passing moment. Showcasing a talented cast that also includes Jennifer Jason Leigh in her umpteenth prostitute role, the movie offers no respite for those looking for frothy entertainment. Moody set pieces and a tightly wound plot make this a successful exercise in high-concept storytelling. Don't be fooled into believing that the semi-predictable plot twist is what the film's about -- this is no Shyamalan venture. 'The Machinist' is coated with several layers of subtext that almost demands a second viewing. With a film this disturbing, that might just be too much to ask for.",10,7,11,23 April 2007
Call Me by Your Name," A sumptuous love story
","Call Me By Your Name is a movie that is meant to be felt and savoured, not analysed. The tender shoulder rub that Oliver gives Elio, the way Elio brushes his hands over Oliver's hairy chest when looking at his pendant, that gentle kiss at the end of that foot rub... so many scenes just crackling with sexual energy.Oh, and I loved the hush that fell on the audience in that last scene where the father was telling his son about embracing his pain. So heartbreakingly beautiful. And that lingering close-up of his face was the best way the movie could have ended.",8,1,4,17 January 2018
Children of Men," A marvel
","Dystopian futures never looked more blissfully bleak than they do in Alfonso Cuarón's anti-futuristic masterpiece, Children of Men. The year is 2027, and humans have lost the ability to procreate. With the death of the world's youngest citizen, people are coming to grips with the fact that their slowly aging population will one day become extinct. The city of London is embroiled in anarchy, with pillagers and terrorists taking the best opportunity from the surrounding chaos. Technology has indeed caught up with the times, but it's a far cry from the ultra-slick future envisaged by other movies in the genre. Amidst this paranoia-stricken populace, an ex-political activist (Clive Owen) unwittingly becomes in charge of protecting and transporting a mysteriously pregnant woman to the seaside sanctuary of a human research facility. Cuarón eschews the potential mawkishness of the story (glimmer of hope, anyone?), opting instead for gritty realism and a restrained background score. The film is also more rife with special effects than it lets on, with several sequences leaving you in complete awe. One particular motorcycle chase leaves you wondering about the logistics of filming it, with the camera playing tricks you haven't quite seen before. Ultimately, where the film fails is in its failure to bring any fresh insight into this oft-repeated premise. The film ostensibly traces its influences to the Orwellian landscape of 1984, but through dazzling cinematography and compelling direction, manages to leave an indelible mark of its own.",10,2,13,5 August 2007
The Fountain," A fountain worth visiting
","It took filmmaker Darren Aronofsky six years to follow up his ferociously brilliant tour de force, Requiem for a Dream, so anticipation for The Fountain was justifiably stratospheric. Internet sites were abuzz with fanboys salivating over the snazzy visuals from the film's promotional material, which is to be expected from the man who brought us the trailblazing editing technique of his previous films. But these sites were also rife with speculation about the film's story itself. Was it a metaphysical exploration of a man's self-discovery? Or was it a time-spanning journey through different historical epochs while attempting to solve a religious riddle? Whatever your interpretation of the film's deliberately ambiguous trailer, there was no denying you were in for a mindblowing ride. So you can imagine the disappointment of critics and filmgoers alike when the movie turned out to be exactly that -- an obfuscated look at life and death which asks more questions than it answers. The Fountain, however, unlike Aronofsky's previous relatively straightforward films, demands to be reviewed in order to be appreciated. Just like the tree of life guarding the titular fountain of youth, the movie grows and evolves with each viewing, as if taunting you with the prospect of ultimate enlightenment which you suspect will never arrive. Mixing together the trippy experience of Kubrick's 2001 with the cryptic philosophical pretensions of Zardoz, The Fountain simmers forth as a steaming plate of meditative reflections with very little in the way of a narrative obstruction. You will marvel at the film's pensive visuals, you will admire the artistry of the film's lead actors (Jackman & Weisz in brilliant form), and you will be encapsulated by the majesty of Clint Mansell's evocative score. This fountain is well worth the visit.",10,2,4,27 August 2007
Rear Window," First-rate thriller
","Having watched it for the second time recently, I was struck by how razor-sharp the film's script actually was. Sure, it didn't have a big Agatha Christie-type mystery reveal; but the banter and repartee between the main characters was just so well-written. Of course, the film's framing and camerawork is legendary (for good reason) and Grace Kelly has a luminous screen presence. Suspenseful, intriguing, and a film that shows off a master at the peak of his craft.",9,8,9,12 February 2018
Fantastic Four," Vapid and Lifeless
","Despite the recent glut of superhero comic book adaptations, many films have actually been good enough to warrant a viewing, with some even bordering on greatness (Spider-Man 2, X2, Hellboy). Sadly, it also becomes inevitable that once in a while, we get uninspired films such as Fantastic Four.It enrages me whenever people defend crapfests like F4 calling it 'escapist entertainment', therefore making it critic-proof because no matter how banal the dialogue or how atrocious the performances, it is just meant to be 'mindless' entertainment right? I don't hate F4 because it's fun-spirited and candy-coated. So is Spider-Man, Singin' in the Rain, or the upcoming Charlie & the Chocolate Factory. But the reason why I despise F4 is that it never strives to be more than a heady string of superhero clichés bound together by a lame script. The whole thing reeks like stale cheese. The sorry attempts at injecting some character development (such as Thing feeling like he doesn't belong) has been done before, and done much better. F4 just wallows in its own mediocrity, perfectly self-content that it's not meant to be taken seriously anyways. And we, as the movie-watching public, have to compromise by saying 'It's good for what it was!' But why should we compromise, when there are other, better movies out there? I believe there is no such thing as perfection in cinema, but there are films that come dangerously close to achieving it. We have the veritable pick of the litter -- why we continue to patronize trash such as F4 is beyond me.",1,18,34,17 July 2005
Annihilation," Sheer, ambitious, risk-taking ballsiness!
","Those expecting a shoot-'em-up in the vein of Aliens will be disappointed. But those who value cerebral science fiction will be thrilled beyond belief. Annihilation is that rare piece of cinema that keeps you engrossed not just with dazzling visuals (of which it has plenty) but also with its sheer, ambitious, risk-taking ballsiness. Uniformly well-acted by a dream cast which includes Natalie Portman and Jennifer Jason Leigh, this movie is not to be missed.",8,3,8,16 March 2018
