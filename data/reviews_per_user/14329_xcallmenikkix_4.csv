Hereditary," Disappointed
","I originally didn't want to watch this film because the trailer had me scared. But after working up the courage to see it, I was sadly disappointed. Everything up until the end of the movie was great. The first half had me on the edge of my seat and wanting to know more, but the ending just left me disappointed and confused. Definitely not the type of ending I had anticipated. I feel like this film had the potential to be a great movie but the ending ruined it for me.",5,0,1,2 July 2018
Ready Player One," Surprisingly awesome
","I went into this movie with extremely low expectations. Personally, I am not a gamer so I didn't think the movie would interest me whatsoever. But, I surprisingly really enjoyed the film! It had a great plot and it was enjoyable seeing all the pop culture references. The storyline had me hooked and wanting more.",10,1,3,2 July 2018
