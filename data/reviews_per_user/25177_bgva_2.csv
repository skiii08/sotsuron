The Longest Yard," Not the Burt Reynolds version, and that's not a bad thing (MINOR spoilers)
","Let it be known that I would be one of the first to stand up against all the Hollywood remakes. This is actually the first time I've wanted to see a remake, and I caught it the weekend it came out. And I must say, I was entertained the whole time. I think if you look at this movie as a football comedy, and not try to compare it to the Burt Reynolds version, you'll enjoy it. I think a lot of people are turned off by this movie for that reason, and because they see this as being nothing more than 'The Waterboy Pt. 2'. But it's not, despite the cameo by Rob Schneider (sp?), which honestly, I could've done without. The characters could've been a little more developed...I mean, why should we root for the 'Mean Machine', other than the fact that the guards were really corrupt? With no character development, it just seemed like we were rooting for the lesser of two evils. The library racism scene w/Nelly was a nice start, but there could've been a few more scenes like that.Like I said, it's a pretty entertaining movie, once you realize that 1) it's not the Burt Reynolds version, and 2) it's not trying to be. I give it 7/10. If you're a football fan, you'll like this movie. The game will probably get you energized, especially the last moments of the game. I usually don't like a bunch of gratuitous split-screens and camera shots, but for a movie like this, it works (in this case, it almost seems like a homage to the original).7/10",Null,0,3,31 July 2005
Knocked Up," Had its moments, but pretty overrated
","I remember all the hype surrounding this movie, and how it was supposed to be the funniest movie of 2007, or the summer. Umm, okay, sure...whatever you say. The problems I had: 1. The fact of the matter is, this movie ran way too long. It ran a little over two hours, which is unheard of for a comedy. They drew way too much out to make this movie.2. The characters were all inconsiderate jerks, but no one wanted to realize it, mainly the women. The men were forced to realize how 'wrong' they were, but we don't get a full resolution of the women's bitterness.2a. It played on the idea of men being irresponsible loser idiot, and women are ball-busting b***hes who can say or do anything they want because they're women. For example, the Debbie character was a completely selfish example, who gave husband Pete a hard time over anything he did, even though she completely overreacted (i.e. his reaction to a possible sexual offender in his neighborhood). When he explains the 'band concerts' he's attended (really a fantasy baseball league') he explains that he lied because he knew she would harass him over it. I'll admit the lying on his part was wrong, but her reaction showed just how she didn't care about anyone other than herself. Apparently this anti-male sentiment spills over to Alison's character, as she throws Ben out of her car in the middle of the street, following a bitter argument.3. The ad-libbing was just horrible. They tried too hard in way too many scenes.4. Some people got tired of the foul language. I got tired of the constant brand name dropping every other line.The movie had its moments, but it wasn't nearly as good as everyone hyped it up to be. And yea, I could've dealt without the 'crowning' scene.",6,3,6,7 October 2007
