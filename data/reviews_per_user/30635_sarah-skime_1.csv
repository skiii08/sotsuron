Walk the Line," Walk the Line..Missing elements
","This film was very moving and emotional and that is what makes it great! I'll be honest I am not a Johnny Cash fan per-say but I like him as a person and absolutely adore some of his songs. I think it did a wonderful portrayal and idea of what he was going through, but it did not cover all the bases, but how can it cover a life of a legend in two hours! The actors are fantastic in singing. There were parts where it gave me goosebumps and flashbacks of the past keep arising from Johnny's near death experiences and June to be there all the way. In the previews they did give the best lines away, which is a tragedy. I like that they put the movie in a story like direction. Absolutely fabulous - I just had a hard time wondering who the artists were being depicted throughout film and why were fellow singers calling him JR? -Sarah S Minnesota",8,0,0,2 March 2006
