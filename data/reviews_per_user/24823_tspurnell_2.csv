It," Why?
","I've never took time out of my non-busy schedule to write a review, but I have to write one for IT. (Laughing) When I tell you guys that I forgot what IT was, I'm not kidding you. I was honestly looking for Barb because I thought the kids were in the upside down aka I thought I was watching Stranger Things...in IMAX. I can't believe I fell for the hype (hides face in shame). I loved that this movie focused in on the kids and didn't go back and forth, but the original, which I vaguely remember, still beats this remake! I think the actors were great, the one kid looks like Ali, and I thought their banter was realistic and super funny; the whole theater was cracking up. If you have absolutely nothing else to do with your time, money, and/or you are depressed...check out Stranger Things...I'm sorry I mean IT.",3,42,88,7 September 2017
Bird Box," I wish I was blindfolded
","I have nothing of substance to say, just like this movie. I let my friends talk me into watching this and now I have no friends. I do like ASMR and this did help me go to sleep, so it's get a 10/10 for that. As for watching it while awake...well I'll never know.",2,4,8,26 December 2018
