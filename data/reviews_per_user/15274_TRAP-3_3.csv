The Devil's Advocate," Best Movie I've Ever Seen
","It is the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Keanu Reeves' charm, Al Pacino's theories, Charlize Theron's smiles, plus the other beauty's body. Wonderful combination.",10,1,1,13 March 1999
Bram Stoker's Dracula," One of the BEST movies made
","It is a classic romantic horror. The history of Dracula and Mina is the key to all the events. I like the way the directer shoots the scenes, especially how 2 things go on at the same time. (Dracula killing Lucy/Mina getting married) Their love is expressed beautifully in this film.Winona Ryder is the perfect actress to play Mina because there is not one single place on her that you can disagree on. Her class is wonderful and all. I like the ending, too.Wonderful movie! A must-see! I really can't describe how much I love this movie by words! See it yourself!",10,1,3,16 March 1999
The Matrix," Okay movie with great actions
","This movie has some of the best action scenes ever made in movie history, yet the conversations in it are killing us. The Matrix started off pretty powerful. The way she knocked those guys over was a brilliant scene, but the plot slows down after that. Every action was slow and the direction to shoot the conversations were boring. We just see 2 people on screen keep talking to each other without good music, humor, or others to accompany them. The movie was about 150 minutes long. I only enjoyed about 50 minutes of it, when the actions took place. I saw the making of the Matrix and expected a good action film. I must say I was disappointed by the result yet still impressed with what they've done for the action parts. Maybe it's because the actions are directed by Chinese people they hired from Asia.",8,0,0,3 April 1999
