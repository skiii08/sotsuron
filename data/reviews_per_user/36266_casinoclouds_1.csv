The Incredible Hulk," Way better than Ang Lee's version, a great adaption of the Incredible Hulk
","OK, so I want to start out saying that everyone needs to remove Ang Lee's The Hulk back in 2003 from their memories forever, because Louis Leterrier is the man by pretty much telling Humpback Mountain director to shove it elsewhere with his adaption to the Incredible Hulk.As soon as the movie started, I loved it more already. Edward Norton was by far the best choice for Bruce Banner over Eric Bana (whom I don't have a problem with, he just doesn't fit the Bruce Banner profile). And Liv Tyler was a great Betty Ross. I've been a fan of both William Hurt and Tim Roth for a very long time, so I was pretty stoked to see them in this as well.Also, Hulk looked way more realistic than Lee's. It's still CGI, of course, but it didn't look like a cartoon in a live action film. I was quite impressed with Louis Leterrier since I wasn't a fan of the Transporter movies, but I decided to give him a chance because he has more experience in the action genre compared to Ang Lee.I also like how they actually stuck to the storyline of the comic. The last one was way screwed up, making Banner's father Absorbing Man, which is completely false. The Abomination looked intense!!! Tim Roth did an amazing job, and I love seeing him as a villain.It wasn't a better comic book film than Iron Man, but it's right below it as far as being one of the best Marvel Comic's ever made.I enjoyed it. Everyone involved did an outstanding job. So with that, I give it 9 out of 10.",9,4,7,16 June 2008
