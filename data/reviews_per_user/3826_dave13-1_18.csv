Moneyball," Non-baseball people will still enjoy this movie...
","...since its dramatic elements are universal: an underdog takes on the established rich and the comfortably smug and beats them by changing the rules of the game. Baseball was fertile terrain for this, since sport even at the highest professional level is notoriously anti-intellectual and conservative. Baseball men would rather underachieve than face ridicule from their peers by rejecting common practice. This is made clear early in the film. Baseball scouts and front office personnel are shown to be making decisions on team makeup in an ad hoc, seat of the pants fashion that disappeared in most other enterprises with the coming of the information age. But any battle against established wisdom and entrenched power has heroic qualities and makes for compelling drama. Baseball just happened to be the venue this time out.The story: after losing key players to richer organizations after the 2002 season, Oakland GM Billy Beane faced the same to succeed as them but with less resources. He needed a cheaper product. His response quietly revolutionized baseball by challenging conventional wisdom about player evaluation and showing it up. The fact that the 'moneyball' approach is now almost universal in pro baseball gives the film's subject the weight of historic interest, but even if the experiment had failed the mission itself was heroic and historic.Brad Pitt, creates a full bodied performance as Beane, a man risks his career and reputation to implement his quiet revolution, while dealing with the fact of a failed playing career and a failed marriage with as much dignity and practicality as he can, and without turning his experiment into a quest. Beane's passion for the game drives him forward without blinding him to the fact that he is running an experiment that might fail. He weathers a storm of opposition and ridicule from others around baseball, from a skeptical and misinformed media, and even within the ranks of even his own team, while he (and the audience) watch the season play out.Jonah Hill successfully underplays a bright outsider on the fringes, whose insights into the game career baseball men won't admit exceed their own, and who serves as the catalyst and caretaker of the Moneyball experiment. Robin Wright strikes the perfect note as the ex-wife who bears Beane no ill will but who has nonetheless moved on with her life. Beane's personal drama is past, but the big public one playing out everyday in the sports pages should be enough conflict for anybody, including the audience.",8,0,1,5 May 2012
Love and Death," Woody sends up Russian cinema & literature
","Back when Woody Allen movies actually sought to entertain, this was one of the best. The familiar Woody nebbish is caught up in the sweep of historical events paralleling those in Tolstoy's War and Peace. Typically, Woody plays the reluctant hero and revolutionary. He would rather pursue the promiscuous Diane Keaton, than fight in the Napoleonic Wars, but he cannot avoid his comic destiny, as events cleverly conspire to drag him from fire to frying pan over and over.The spread of targets for parody in this romp is its greatest strength. Even a well-schooled cineaste will be hard-pressed to catch the many clever references to famous Russian films and novels, notably the 1968 Sergei Bonderchuk version of War and Peace and the silent 1925 classic Battleship Potemkin.",8,1,1,30 April 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Solid ending to epic saga
","The Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, taken as a saga, has the epic sweep and wild energy of the old time Hollywood pirate adventures. It's fun nonsense worthy of Robert Howard or H. Ryder Haggard, with deft comic timing, death-defying stunts and a literal boatload of roguish supporting characters. The final movie is an improvement over the second one, which I nonetheless enjoyed. Like any good adventure flick, this one takes the audience to places only imagined. The trailer hinted at this, showing previews of the Black Pearl making its way to end of the world and going over the edge! Although quite long at almost three hours, the viewer is taken to the end of our world and into the next, to Davy Jones' Locker, to the Singapore fortress of Asia's most dangerous pirate, to Shipwreck Cove and its town built entirely from the hulks of wrecked ships (!), to a final showdown with the British Navy at the edge of a maelstrom that threatens to sink both fleets. Money and technology were well used here to give color and flesh to what is essentially a very tall tale. A legend of the sea. A fish story. Blu-Ray takes great advantage of this, bringing out the high end effects with eye-popping clarity.Some reviewers have complained that it is 'unrealistic'. Tosh. Realism is for weepy dramas. The characters are sometimes dwarfed by the scale of things, but then again Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom are supposedly playing ordinary people following extraordinary destinies. And anyway, Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush can steal any scene, even one with a kraken in it. The script is a little thin, but at least workable and again an improvement over Pirates #2, albeit a slight one. Neither really has dialogue worthy of its sweeping story line.The ending, BTW, is perfectly suited to such a legendary tale, bringing characters together and sending others on their way as the saga continues.",7,0,2,13 April 2012
Gettysburg," Stiff dramatically, but with great battlefield scenes.
","Excellent, historically accurate to the last waistcoat button re- creations of the assault on Little Round Top and Pickett's Charge make up the middle and last third of the film respectively, and these are the highlights of this sprawling four hour epic by far. An all-star cast is featured with Martin Sheen headlining as Robert E. Lee, but the real standouts are Jeff Daniels as Col. Chamberlain and Tom Berenger as Gen. James Longstreet as two ordinary seeming men thrust into an extraordinary situation and trying to provide leadership for frightened men headed likely to their deaths. Most of the character drama of the film however is stiff and ponderous with everybody pontificating at each other much of the time and aiming for doom-laden significance with every syllable. Director Ronald Maxwell never could direct actors very well, a deficiency that continued into this movie's later prequel 'Gods and Generals'.The thing Maxwell does best is staging period battle recreations; the location cinematography is excellent and this pulls the viewer back into the moment very quickly any time the action starts up, however much the stagy theatrics might have earlier distracted.",7,1,1,29 April 2012
Léon: The Professional," Slick and entertaining.
","A wonderful cast, especially Jean Reno and a 12-year-old Natalie Portman, highlights this high energy action thriller helmed by Luc Besson. The always interesting Gary Oldman plays a clever, dangerous and very bent cop who murders the family of a lowlife drug runner, unaware that a young daughter (Portman) has survived and sought the protection of a hit-man (Reno). The plot follows her pursuit of revenge against the cop, but the film centers on the unusual relationship that develops between the now- orphaned girl and the loner hit-man. This is the best aspect of the film: logical, carefully developed, sweet and dramatically powerful.The production is great-looking, slick yet effectively gritty and realistic and the action sequences are brilliantly staged. This was the first Luc Besson film I had ever seen and recognized that I was seeing a really big new talent. Highly recommended.",8,2,5,15 April 2012
Apocalypse Now," One of the most ambitious movies of the 70s
","Apocalypse Now is one of those movies on which few critics agree. It was extremely ambitious, and what you think of it really comes down to what you thought those ambitions were and whether you thought they were met. The original theatrical version had a couple of scenes missing, a scene with a French family at a plantation and scene where the boat catches up to the Playboy girls a second time at a fuel dump. The studio wanted them cut because the movie was running long, but without them you get a feeling that some story threads are left hanging. The director's cut is more structurally coherent and more fully explored thematically, but also longer and a bit draggy. The shorter version feels a bit more episodic and disjointed, which critics who disliked it when they saw it in the 70s seized on as a major flaw, but it really wasn't. Simply a shortcoming of rather grand ambitions.In Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, a guy goes upriver in Africa to find a white jungle trader, now sick. The corruption caused by illness parallels the corruption of the man's soul. It's a rumination on the nature of evil in men. But the movie doesn't really follow the plot of the book. The movie's other major conceptual influence was Dante's Inferno, an epic Italian poem in which the narrator is given a tour of Hell. Vietnam is presented in the movie like Dante's conception of Hell, and the illustrations of Hieronymous Bosch who created several famous paintings of Dante's vision. Nightmarish images of waste and the futility of life and wages of sin.Images like that damaged helicopter hanging out of jungle tree are designed to resonate with the work of Dante and Bosch. It's not just a wrecked helo, it's an image of human failure and corruption. Anyway, Dante's work is episodic, as the narrator tours one area of Hell, then another with little or no connecting narrative thread. The movie is rather this way too. Then when the movie makes it to Marlon Brando's camp, it comes sharply back to Conrad's book, as Brando is Kurtz, Vietnam equivalent to the Brit trader in Heart of Darkness. Brando forces Willard to confront his ambivalence about the war. Is Kurtz himself evil, or just more in tune with an evil enterprise than they are? It's a story about war as a human activity, in which war takes on all aspects of the human experience. Exhilarating, horrifying, nightmarish, grotesque, elusive, unfair and above all illogical. Kilgore and Kurtz are clearly insane, but did the war make them that way or select them because they were that way? Willard is presented as the only rational man in an irrational situation and his inability to make sense of the experience is a key how the viewer should respond.",9,0,1,14 February 2011
The Mist," Solid fright movie
","Stephen King's The Mist is so much more than just an action-horror story. Trapped in a supermarket, surrounded by flying and slithering horrors of unknown origin, a community of people who should be working together for mutual survival instead splits into dangerous, internecine factions. Strong personalities assert themselves to achieve dominance whether they are right or not. Flat Earth denialists are willing to risk everything to prove to the group that nothing is actually wrong, when clearly something VERY wrong is going on. A local religious nutcase becomes a charismatic tyrant, exploiting fear to spread her twisted version of the Old Testament. Logic and social accountability go out the window to be replaced by selfishness and power-grabbing. It is human politics and religion in miniature, as well as a glimpse at how close supposedly civilized humanity is to descending into primitivism and savagery that makes Lord of the Flies look like a Victorian tea party. It is to Frank Darabont's credit that his adaptation left alone much of the structure of King's novel, while giving the exercise a nice other-worldly cinematic look. The film is shot in bled-out colors, giving the world within the Mist and the characters themselves a cheerless, hopeless appearance. The monsters themselves are suitably strange and ugly and lethal, and the ensemble cast, which ranges from highly effective (Marcia Gay Harden) to barely adequate (Thomas Jane), manages to successfully impart the appropriate air of menace and hopelessness the situation requires. It should be noted that, while the film follows the progression of the novel reasonably faithfully for most of its length, the revised ending may leave fans of the book irritated. The overall viewing experience is worthwhile, but I would recommend that fans of the book leave right when the novel itself ends. The tacked-on ending will have you frustrated.",7,0,3,9 February 2008
Patton," A rare '10'.
","Patton is quite simply one of the best American movies ever made. The script is a marvel, managing to create an intimate portrait of someone who strode a grand path through one of history's most important sagas, and the performances are wonderful and unflinching, warts and all. Patton's character flaws as well as his merits impacted on the events and people around him, and this movie has a rare ability to show this.To tell the story of the man, the legacy, the myth and the moment and to do it with such cinematic panache, such stunning visuals; to create such an incredible visual landscape of literal history and at the same time a symbolic journey into one person's mind and beliefs and to see how all of this played into what he accomplished, good and bad is a marvellous and rare achievement. Patton becomes, like a great literary character, defined by his contradictions: a modern warrior obsessed with the past and his possible past lives; deeply religious, yet deeply profane; a master of details who often watched seemingly insignificant events unravel his private and professional ambitions.* mild spoiler *The final shot of Patton staring at a windmill like a modern Don Quixote is at once both poignant and telling. like the whole film, it is great cinema and great biographical history.",10,1,2,12 April 2012
Pi," A rare achievement.
","It's uncertain whether shows like Numbers would even exist, if not for this early Aronofsky picture that proved mathematics could be cinematically compelling.A math genius is on the brink of discovering a mathematical theorem which governs the behavior of many things in the universe. Some shady characters want to use his knowledge to manipulate the stock market. The result is a gloomy, suspenseful thriller which succeeds by virtue of its unique visual style in presenting a compelling view of genius on the edge of madness while seducing the viewer into the main character's obsession with the potency of numbers. The idea of a hard-core science fiction movie in noir style with a low budget, a nobody cast and built around the subject of esoteric mathematics seems pretty outré. That is works this well is a genuine achievement.",9,0,1,23 April 2012
Kelly's Heroes," A great personal favorite, and a terrific movie.
","At a time when movie audiences found themselves confused and bored by youth culture movies that seemed to have no plot and no point, and studio executives had clearly lost sight of how to make a successful picture, along came this movie with just about the perfect blend of the new and bold with the tried and true. It successfully mixed easily recognizable, Old Hollywood forms (the WWII action picture, and Telly Savalas as a tough sergeant whose first and only thought was for his men; the military comedy with Don Rickles as the hustling Sgt. Bilko- style supply sergeant) with the latest cinematic trends (heist movies, crime thrillers with the slightly amoral viewpoint of focusing on the perpetrators, Clint Eastwood as a laconic Sergio Leone anti-hero looking out for himself, Donald Sutherland as a Bohemian proto-hippie). The result was a deft exercise in product updating and a huge hit. Any longtime fan of WWII actioners had a lot to enjoy, while the disaffected protester next to him ate up the idea of infantry grunts defying orders to pull off a robbery! The reason behind the success of this movie was simply high quality at every level. Action sequences were beautifully staged and shot and were highly exciting, comedic elements (satire, sight gags, throw away jokes) were integrated smoothly into the action without ever seeming forced or out of place, and the ensemble work amongst the mismatched crew worked brilliantly as contrasting types played off one another to generate both comedy and occasional tension. The dialogue crackled with clever exchanges, along with tons of sad sack humor and character business, all played against the epic background of a big budget war picture. Clever satiric touches find their way into the mix as well. I love the early scene in which an officer reminds a subordinate that the penalty for looting is death, all the while securing a commandeered sailboat for shipment to his uncle, the general! There is so much here to like that the movie almost demands repeated viewing just to properly appreciate the sheer volume and quality of its component elements. Enjoy. More than once.",9,4,5,29 April 2012
Singin' in the Rain," Best musical ever. Thanks MGM.
","This movie was recently chosen by British critics as the best musical ever made, and not by accident. The song and dance numbers are elaborately staged and full of energy, the production design is gorgeous and everything looks colorful and lit up brightly in classic MGM fashion with lots of high key lighting effects. No detail was spared and no expense either, on costumes, set pieces. It just looks phenomenal. Also - rare for a musical comedy - the plot is actually worthy of being followed. So many musicals have just enough plot to string the audience along between songs, but this one has a clever, funny story line that plunges briskly ahead, tracking the ups and downs of the coming of sound to the movies. It could have been done as a comedy without the songs and still been a great movie, and how many musicals can say that?More than anything, though, the musical numbers actually fit into the emotional background of the story. Yes, cast members start singing or jigging and music appears from no discernible source - pretty standard for the era - but the numbers are a joyous expression of friendship, a means to express ideas, to mock, to revel in the moment. So many musicals have to contrive reasons to put in song and dance numbers, and sometimes don't even bother with logic and just throw them in anyway. Here, no musical number fails to fit logically or character-wise. This movie is a triumph. Watch it once a year forever.",9,0,2,30 April 2012
Once Upon a Time in America," Worth the investment of time.
","Some reviewers of this movie have complained about its length (almost 4 hours). So? Watch it on two successive nights in two hour installments, and count your self lucky. For years, the sole version of this movie that was available on video was severely cut down, shorter by 90 minutes, and the result was nothing less than butchery. It was like somebody deciding Picasso's Guernica was too huge, so let's take these scissors and make it smaller... Actions taken by the adult characters often made no sense, since those actions were supposed to resonate with actions taken when the characters were young, and those earlier actions were cut out. Spend the time, watch the movie and think about what you are seeing. This is, simply put, one of the five best movies of 1984 and in the long version you get to see it in all of its broad sweeping and elaborate narrative structure and all of its interesting little details. Marvel at the cast of young actors (including a then 13-year-old Jennifer Connelly) who dream of something better than the immigrant ghetto poverty they grew up in, and watch as their dreams and schemes and casual morality sow the seeds of the adults they will become. Live in their America, in the moment and across the decades - an America of limitless opportunity, but also of infinite potential for corruption and exploitation. Success in this America meant always having something on the go and it usually meant trying to keep one step ahead of the cops, whether you were a street punk or a 'legitimate businessman'. Note: other Zippers have made much of DeNiro's gangster's attempted rape of his former childhood friend in the film, but this scene was by no means gratuitous or exploitative. It was, in fact, a demonstration of how far the worlds of the two had grown apart, and this is just one example of how deeply and symbolically EVERYTHING in this movie resonates. A movie this ambitious or good can't ever be 'too long'.",9,3,6,13 April 2012
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Ignore the outlandish plot device and enjoy the scenery.
","John and Jane Smith are a long married couple who have stopped communicating in any meaningful way. It's not that they hate each other. They make polite small talk but seem more like roommates than a couple. The reason for this is that everything they say to each other is a lie because each is an undercover assassin. Maintaining an innocuous facade to conceal this fact has made them bored and distant. They each learn simultaneously that the other has been assigned to hit them, but instead of checking with THE SPOUSE, each assumes that the marriage was a false front, entered into to keep an eye on the other and gain information. Each decides to test the other instead of actually discussing the situation openly, misunderstandings occur and this leads to an escalating war of words and more than a few bullets. And then there is that staple of the action comedy, the groin kick. Take THAT Brad Pitt... My take on the central story device was that it was a 're-imagining' of that old chestnut the 'oops-we're-not-really-married' gambit. How many 60s sitcoms used it to kill an episode? Gilligan's Island, The Flintstones, The Dick Van Dyke Show etc. etc. It's a pretty shopworn story device by this point. But, in the wake of movies like Fatal Attraction, and The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, in which a character within or close to the main household turns out to be a threat, likely somebody got the half-clever idea that instead of not being married, the couple should find out that they had no idea to whom it was they were married. In short, let's substitute subversion of legal concepts like 'good faith' and 'informed consent' for the more straightforward device of not legally being married. And laughs and many expended shell casings ensue.The resulting movie is strictly popcorn fare, built around a central plot device so outlandish as to defy reason, and yet quite entertaining despite this, thanks to imaginative staging of fantastically elaborate action set pieces and tightly choreographed comedy ballets. The technical demands of their roles are surprisingly varied and one has to gain an appreciation for Pitt and Jolie in this regard. They are as attractive as the picture's background scenery, but more than just eye candy. A potential action classic and worth a watch at least once.",7,0,3,30 April 2012
The Departed," Excellent Boston-based thriller
","Martin Scorcese won a long overdue best director Oscar for this, his first movie with a plot, and if not entirely deserved the honor was not entirely misguided either. The Departed is a tightly made LITTLE crime/suspense thriller, basically a very good modern film noir (note the use of bled out colors to evoke a noir sensibility) with two strongly drawn drawn main characters driven by contrasting needs and ambitions and nicely creative supporting work by Nicholson especially and Baldwin to a lesser extent. (No kudos for Walberg. The screenplay gave him a unique patter, as baroque as it is foul-mouthed, but the performance is all in the writing. Walberg adds nothing in the way of nuance. Can he spell 'nuance'? One wonders. How does this guy manage to sustain a career? Must have one hell of an agent...) Anyway, the entertaining main story line twists around and around like a caduceus to the point of seeming overly contrived, especially as regards the psychologist character who winds up getting involved with both of the lead characters, one of whom is a patient - a professional no-no, and highly unlikely anyway even if he is Leo Dicaprio. If you can get past some of the more extreme manipulations of the plot, this is a richly enjoyable movie.",8,0,1,18 April 2012
A Hard Day's Night," A must for Beatle fans.
","It is very hard not to like this movie if you're a Beatle fan. Filled with the youthful exuberance of the Fab Four, it zips through a long working day of Beatlemania as the lads dodge screaming hordes of female fans while traveling to make a live TV appearance. It has all of the innocent fun that made the pre-Yoko Beatles the most popular group in music history. John, for instance, is a sardonic boyish wag with none of the acrimonious, world-weariness that characterized his appearances with the later Beatles. And Ringo is an innocent abroad who runs afoul of the law, setting up the movie's erstwhile story line of freeing him from the clutches of the police in time for the broadcast. Great, silly, charming and timeless fun.",8,2,2,23 April 2012
The Last King of Scotland," Seduction of the Innocent Abroad
","Not just a historical chronicle, this film also tells an important lesson about morality in a world without consequences. The viewpoint character, a newly-graduated Scottish doctor, is presented as being morally uncentered to begin with. He is not driven to practice medicine in a Uganda clinic out a sense of moral obligation to his fellow man but to escape the shadow of his illustrious surgeon father. His other choices, to join Idi Amin as his personal physician, to turn a blind eye to rumors of atrocities being committed by Amin's regime, and later to seduce one of Amin's wives are made with similar casualness. Amin, as portrayed by Forrest Whitaker, is a man of seductive charm but with the appetites and vindictiveness of a spoiled child. He is a man without restraint in a world which imposes none upon him. As the film chronicles Amin's descent into butchery, it gives us the parallel story of the young doctor's slow slide into decadence. The climax to both stories comes at Entebee, during the famous Israeli hostage crisis, when the crimes of both the doctor and Amin himself can no longer remain hidden from the world. It is this two layered story structure that gives the film its great power. A western audience watching simply a day-to-day retelling of events within Uganda during this time, would likely remain emotionally distanced, tut-tutting at the misfortunes of others. The character of the doctor and his parallel story forces the viewer to participate in the day-to-day world of Amin's Uganda and to examine and question his own moral strength in the face of similar opportunities and choices.",8,0,2,9 February 2008
Sherlock Holmes," CSI: Victorian London meets Fight Club with a dash of Trainspotting - Superdave
","Sherlock Holmes has been played more times by more different actors than almost any other role, and director Guy Ritchie has tackled the job of revitalizing and revisioning Conan Doyle's famous detective for the Harry Potter generation with this mostly successful and diverting entertainment. In the first five minutes of the movie, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson manage to capture an English Lord who has taken up the Black Arts as part of a sinister grab for supreme political power in Victorian England. And the arrest and even hanging of the sorcerer does nothing to slow down the timetable of his master scheme. Holmes himself, as conceived by the writers and portrayed by Downey Jr., is almost the anti-Basil Rathbone: slobbish, obsessed and substance abusing, barely able to contain let alone find outlet for his vast interests and towering intellect. Unlike the dapper, arch and self-assured Rathbone, Downey Jr. is perpetually down at heels and on the verge of emotional melt-down, whipsawing between scientific experimentation and chasing criminals, and finding occasional release in back-alley bare-knuckle brawling and jags of drunkenness. It is a daring and interesting re-conception of one of the most familiar figures in literature and this portrait of Holmes is odd enough alone to keep the audience diverted while the central criminal plot unfolds. Holmes' world is dirty, fog-bound and grim to the point of being near monochromatic, a far cry from the usually spotless, glamorized Hollywood image of gas-lit London. Unexpected and recommended viewing.",8,0,1,6 February 2010
Iron Man," Big silly fun
","The effects for this movie are ground-breaking. Unlike a lot of recent superhero movies where you can see what is CGI and what's not, the flying sequences, fighting action and explosions all integrate seamlessly and are completely convincing. Robert Downey Jr. is perfectly cast as a rather dissipated 40ish drunk and former whiz kid who still has talent and charisma enough to get by, but needs a purpose. Art imitating life? He gets it when he finds his weapons are being sold to both sides in the current Afghan conflict, and decides to intercede as Iron Man. Downey is his usual likable self and Gwyneth Paltrow plays his girl-Friday-but-not-love-interest secretary with understated style; their relationship is actually charming and credible, a rare thing in action movies. The movie itself strikes a deft balance between shoot-em- up and peacenik sensibilities as the hero strives for peace and justice through superior technology and firepower. This is also rare and welcome in the action movie genre, which tend to perpetuate Reagan-era right- through-might attitudes. Entertaining, smart and very watchable, this movie is highly recommended by me.",8,0,2,13 April 2012
