Whip It," Wonderfully made movie
","Love whip it. Its one of the rare movies that stand out from the crowd. Love those. Drew Barrymore did great as director. I was shocked that this was her directorial debut. Cause how great the movie was, I actually believed that she was a veteran behind the camera.Wonderful directing, great story, awesome cast, spectacular movie! I give it 8/10",8,1,1,18 June 2020
The Irishman," Wonderfully made!!!
","I enjoyed this movie very much. I finished it earlier today, it was great.Also love the return of the 'cinematic mafia'
Director Martin Scorsese, Robert de niro, joe pesci and Harvey keitel.Great cinematography as well. Shot in both film and digital. (Super 35, Alexa mini cameras and red helium cameras)My most favorite scene in the whole movie is when jimmy Hoffa was in the Nashville courtroom, after the would be assassin got stopped and tackle to the ground, Hoffa said 'with a gun, you tackle. With a knife, you run!'.When the real Irishman said he's the one who killed hoffa and regretted doing it because how close friends they were, its actually, really convincing to me. Seriously, who's the last person (or people) you ever expect to hurt you or get ya killed?. Your best friends or family members you are close with the most.Anyway it was a great film!",Null,0,4,5 January 2020
Baby Driver," Eiza Gonzalez was the greatest!!!
","Truthfully, honestly. I hate the movie, but I truly, happily love eiza Gonzalez, her character darling, some of the car stunts and some of the music (love the parts when eiza got to drive a little bit at the start also love when she sings 'nowhere to run' later, riding in car. eiza has a beautiful singing voice). They're the only ones that truly and actually stood out from the whole thing. matter of fact, eiza and darling are the only memorable, unpredictable and original ones in this whole thing. Also a fact, eiza is the only reason why I watch the stupid movie in the first place!!! One of eiza's best performances (even though she's only in it for around 20 mins) rest of the movie and characters were predictable, cliched, typical and boring. Also too fast paced. When darling got killed, I was beyond upset, mad and bored throughout the rest. Its not what I wanted to see, darling deserves better then that And it made my anxiety worse (ill explain that later). Oh please, please, please don't get me wrong. I love eiza with all my heart & soul she's my most favorite girl in the whole universe and my most favorite and the greatest singer/actress ever. I support eiza no matter what. I still love darling very much as well. I'm so so happy that eiza had a fun time making the movie & enjoyed playing as darling, got along with everybody on/off set and got to work with one of her favorite directors (so far). But I'm just sick and tired of seeing the same story and plotline being used over and over in different versions. And extremely fed up when special characters that stand out from the crowd and add something more interesting and special (such as darling) Don't have enough screen time or get killed off!. Hate both of that. Hope eiza can forgive me, I can never able to watch darling's death scene or baby driver ever again. One more thing, I'm not being biased, I'm just brutally honest of how I feel about eiza and the movie... And I love eiza so, so much. I love you eiza Gonzalez!!!Yours truly,
Corman 'THE ENIGMA' Tarantino.",4,2,5,9 October 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," One of the greatest movies ever!!!
","I love all of Quentin tarantino's movies, but this is my most favorite Besides death proof (2007)This is some of rare movies from Hollywood that stand out from the crowd. And I love & enjoy it very much. Its original, unpredictable and outside of the box.Wonderful directing, great cinematography, terrific acting.I truly believe that this movie actually came from 1969. That's how great is was. Also great twists and turns on what happened if the killers got the taste of their own medicine, instead of Sharon Tate and her friends that nightAlso love that they shot the whole thing on film and in different formats (8mm, 16mm and 35mm) love to do that in my movies as well.This is an Oscar winner. I Give this movie 9/10",9,1,4,29 December 2019
1917," Instant cinematic treasure
","I watched this in theaters yesterday as my birthday present. It is one of the greatest films I've ever seen. Great cinematography, looks as if (almost) the whole movie was shot in one take and focus on the main characters on their journey/mission. And wonderful directing. Sam Mendes did fantastic. I know his great granddaddy (lance corporal Alfred mendes) would be so proud.Besides my other favorite movies, this one's a rare gem. Its original, unpredictable, outside of the box, full of risks and one of a kind. Love it!!!.Give this movie 10/10.Two soldiers trying to reach a battalion to stop where they are, before charging into a deathtrap. And have until tomorrow morning to deliver the message... No pressure!!!",10,2,5,30 January 2020
Joker," Oscar winner
","I got home from watching this in theaters a few hours ago,. It is truly one of the greatest, spectacular, wonderful and most marvelous movies ever made. 10 out of 10!!!!!. From start to finish, I was completely hypnotized from this true cinematic wonder.original, outside of the box, risk taking and unpredictable. I love that with a capital L.Even though its not exactly true to the comics, but truly love how much the movie's originality was inspired by them.I put this on top of my list of my most favorite movies that stand out. Along with my favorite directors and favorite actresses (ariana grande and eiza Gonzalez) rare gems that truly stand out from the crowd.I'm a filmmaker myself and JOKER also inspired me to shoot with the Alexa 65 even much more now. (Someday soon)Great direction,
Cinematography,
Acting,
Look and feel the movie gives. Etc,etc.I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!",10,3,5,18 October 2019
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," I love the cinematography
","Ok. I didn't like the story of the movie that much. It was too warped (even for me) and too negative. But I love Michael keaton and truly love how the whole movie was shot.
Honestly love that the movie with a steadicam (most favorite camera rig) and looks (almost) as it was all done in one take. That I give two thumbs up. Both the cinematography and Michael Keaton.",6,2,2,31 October 2019
Mother!," Awesome!
","I only saw it once, but it left a great, giant, pulsing impression on me. It was beautifully made from start to finish. A warped version of bible in a 2 hour long movie. When I first saw the trailers, I visualized it differently. I felt it was about the wife of a troubled poet, feeling terrorized by invading strangers who are fans of her husband. And the poet finds 'inspiration' from them.But after watching the movie, I was..... 'Wow,. That was completely opposite of what I visualized'.Darren aronofsky did great with this one. 9/10",9,4,7,22 October 2019
Sin City," A violent-filled treasure
","Love that its a graphic novel come to life. The effects - beautiful. Something I love to learn and do. Find it awesome that there's no script, only the books were guides for this movie.My most favorite part of the whole thing, is with Nancy Callahan and frank hartigan's love story. I'm happy to see how much true love they have for each other. Enjoyed it very much.I give this movie 10/10",10,0,0,9 November 2019
