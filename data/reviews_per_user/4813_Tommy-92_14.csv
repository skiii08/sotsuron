Casablanca," A great movie, that's all there is to it
","First of all, the story is mesmerizing; it's one of those movies you have to watch closely to understand, but once you do, are kept in its grip striaght through to the end.  Bogart and Bergman are wonderful together, with marvelous chemistry and sexual tension.  However, both stand on their own two feet very well, and give excellent performances.  Claude Rains is also quite good as the police cheif who is the recipeint of the famous line, 'I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship'.  Which brings us to the glorious dialogue that deserves to be quoted (and undoubtedly will be) until the end of time.  While overly melo-dramatic at times, the film never loses its power and we can always identify with the characters.  Thank God this is one of the better-looking films of its era; most others have only survived in fading prints with muddy sound and fuzzy pictures, but this has always been kept in top-notch condition, to be enjoyed endlessly.  May very well be the greatest film of all time.",9,0,0,18 September 1999
Citizen Kane," Makes a stronger impression the second time around, at least to me.
","The first time I saw this movie, I was completely indifferent towards it.  I really did not care one way or the other about it and had no real opinion. The second time, it made a stronger impression.  I got a better sense of the great camera work, plot, performances, basically everything.  Overall, it was better the second time.  But I had to read a lot of critical reviews to fully realize just how 'great' it is.Now, the whole question of this film's greatness is just a matter of opinion.  (You did know that, right?)  Since much of the world thinks it's the greatest film ever made, you'd think it must be at least reasonably good, and most people do.  But then again, most of the people who initially thought it was great were made up of that crazy group of intellectuals, so that turns off some people.  I leave you to form your own opinion.  But maybe you ought to watch it twice, just in case.",8,0,1,17 January 2000
Shakespeare in Love," Clever, witty, delightful, but Best Picture of the year?
","I had a wonderful time watching this.  It was very funny and witty, and often quite clever.  Gweneth Platrow was okay.  Joseph Fiennes was very good as the impassioned Shakespeare.  Both have marvelous chemistry.  Very funny support from Geoffrey Rush, and Judi Dench was good, too.  Though I haven't seen any of the other nominees for Best Picure (Saving Private Ryan, Elizabeth, Life is Beautiful, etc.) I really wonder why this won.  It was very light, not deep at all.  Aren't Oscars supposed to be for great artistic acheievement?  Nothing of the kind here.  Oh, well, it was still good but not the greatest film of the year.",7,1,2,20 September 1999
Fargo," Weird yet absorbing
","The plot just kind of meanders along, not going anywhere much of the time. And a lot of this is just plain weird.  And yet there's something about this that fascinated me.  Was it the funky accents?  (No offense to Minnosotans; I've never been there, so this was kind of a shock.)  The stark shots of snowy days?  The music?  The performances?  The darkly funny bits?  The realism?  Who knows?  Maybe it is over-rated, but it sure does grow on you...",7,0,0,16 January 2000
North by Northwest," Great fun to watch, if a bit confusing and far-fetched.
","This is a great film.  Very entertaining to watch, with no real discernible lulls in the action, plenty of suspense and also plenty of witty lines.  The famed crop-duster scene and the equally famed climax on Mount Rushmore both create effective tension thanks to the way they are shot and directed by Hitchcock, the great score by Bernard Herrman (Abesent in the first scene but used very well in the latter), and the expressions the actors use. Speaking of actors, Cary Grant is, as always, fine, great with the one-liners and always impeccably dressed.  Eva Marie Saint is sexy, though something I can't quite put my finger on is missing from her performance. James Mason and Martin Landau is suitably evil.  Nevertheless, there are a few holes.  (Spoilers!)  I guess a murder of someone from the United Nations would cause a small uproar in New York, but all over the country?  Grant certainly is bemused over everything, but only mildly.  Wouldn't he be a bit more frightened?  Some of it is a bit far-fetched and confusing.  (Is The Professor good or bad?  If Vandamm survived, then what happened to him?  The Mount Rushmore scene is great, but could they really live through it?) Well, I'm quibbling, really, and actually, I guess this only makes the film better, since it keeps you guessing all the time.  This is recommended.  May very well be one of Hitchcock's best, though I've got to see more of his films to be sure.",Null,0,1,25 January 2000
Judgment at Nuremberg," Preachy but effective, with many great performances
","I did not find Spencer Tracy to be self-righteous, as others did.  He was just... well, Spencer Tracy as judge, and fine, I thought.  The self-righteous character in this movie, for me, was Richard Widmark's prosecutor.  Maybe it was because he had the easy job, (How hard was it going to be to convince everyone that these Nazi war criminals should be convicted?) but he was just too preachy for me.  I really couldn't stand him.  Apparently all Stanley Kramer dramas have some amount of preachiness to them, and it's there in here, all right.  But there are still great performances from Tracy, Burt Lancaster as one of the defendants, Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland as two of the witnesses, and Marlene Dietrich as a German woman who tries to convince Tracy 'that we're not all monsters.'  As for Maximillian Schell, who plays the German lawyer defending the criminals and won the film's only acting Oscar, he's pretty good, too, but doesn't particularly stand out among such a great cast.  Yes, the film is overlong and has a few draggy, boring spots, but is also has several effective scenes, such as several testimonies of the witnesses and the scene showing (most of) the greusome details of the Holocaust.  That really does get to you, even with Widmark narrating.",Null,2,5,30 April 2000
Gone with the Wind," Though very soapy at times, otherwise thorughly engrossing and wonderfully filmed and acted
","Yes, there are too many suds in the second part.  Perhaps the view of the Old South is too idealistic, but keep in mind that Margaret Mitchell based the book on stories her parents and grandparents had told her.  She was born in 1900, well after the Civil War, and grew up hearing this stuff.  Of course they were going to paint themselves as righteous, gallant, wonderful people so horribly wronged by the Yankees just because they owned darkies like cattle, and who was little Peggy to argue with them?  That said, the movie is pretty good.  Alas, I've only seen it on T.V. and VHS, so I haven't seen the full power of the scope, but I've gotten a hefty dose of it, I think.  Many of the shots really are gorgeous, and some are quite powerful, too.  The first time I saw ut, for some reason I was so affected by the scene where Scarlett is driving Melanie, Prissy, and baby horugh a field right after the rain storm.  A rainbow is out and the sun is shining, but the field is bare and here and there are bloody corpses.  'The devestation!' I thought that first time I saw it; I really haven't thought otherwise in the 5 or so times I've seen it since.  While of course it was Selznick's picture and no one has ever argued with that, due credit must be given to the four directors (probably more) who worked on it for doing such a wonderful job in keeping the interest up through the whole four hours and doing such a great job at it, with only a few flagging-attention spots.  Then there's the acting.  Vivien Leigh is great; now I simply can't imagine anyone else as Scarlett.  Bette Davis? Joan Crawford??  Norma Shearer???  Lucille Ball????  I just can't imagine any of them in the role when Leigh was so good.  To be able to be flirtatious, sexy, bitchy, strong-willed, and a cry-baby, all equally well! She really brightens up the picture, and thank God for that; she's in every scene!  Clark Gable is wonderfully wry and provides a light touch, welcomely recieved, to the more sudsy, cheesy parts.  He and Leigh have marvelous chemistry, and he's very brave to be able to think he can tame her!  He plays it wonderfully cool in the last scene, while Leigh, in a very rare low spot, resorts to surprsingly annoying and cheesy histrionics, though she probably was so sick of the long hours/months spent on this that she was just taking out her frustration the only way she knew how.  Olivia De Havilland quietly plays the part of Melanie wonderfully; without calling attention to herself, she provides a solid anchor for Scarlett and just acts the part wonderfully.  Leslie Howard is just dull as Ashley, but then maybe that was supposed to be the point, that Scarlett somehow was so convinced he was perfect that she failed to realize how wrong he was for her.  Hattie McDaniel as Mammy is funny, but not in a demeaning way.  She must have worked very ahrd not to appear to be your average, 'Yes, mas'r, I'se here' black maid as they were being portrayed at the time, and succeeds wnderfully.  Her performance was good enough to get an Oscar nomination, let alone the award, so that should say something!  Prissy, on the other hand, is pretty demeaning, because all she does is wail and act stupid.  No wonder Butterfly McQueen was ashamed of the role!  If I were her, I'd become a recluse and never think of leaving my house.  Yes, the view of slavery is over-simplified, but Peggy Mitchell's family's accounts of it probably were, too, as they didn't see anything wrong with it at all.Masterful performances for the most part, masterful direction, script, music, (Oh, the music!), cinemetography, scenery, and everything else is entirely masterful.  No, it's not the greatest movie of all time, but it sure is close!  Definitly recommended.",8,1,3,15 September 1999
Singin' in the Rain," I don't care what anyone says, this is the best movie musical ever!
","Just about every number in this film has at least something (and almost always many things) that make it very enjoyable and an instant classic. 'Moses Supposes' has a catchy tune and rousing chereography.  'Good Mornin'' also is very catchy and upbeat.  'The Braodway Melody' does go on and doesn't add anything, but it's got Cyd Charisse and some amazingly colorful costumes.  What else can be said about 'Make 'Em Laugh?' that hasn't already been said?  It's got the talent of Donald O'Connor and some real knockout routines, (But that's already been said.)  And the title tune,... Gene Kelly's joy and happiness is just so infectious!  And plus, it's already a classic.  I wish that were more than enough to convince you to see it.  If not, then it's got some very funny satire on the transition from silent pictures to talkies, with a hilarious performance from Jean Hagen as Lina Lamont.  (Just hearing her voice will make you crack up, promise!)  Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, and Debbie Reynolds also give good performances but not great ones.  Still good enough, though.  PLEASE SEE THIS!  You'll be all the better for it, really.  Even if you don't like musicals, you will no doubt at least like it, and probably love it.",9,2,5,14 October 1999
Titanic," Has its flaws, but in my opinion was pretty good
","Yes, it was wildly over-rated, in that respect serving only to inflate Jim cameron's ego.  Yes, it is certainly not the best movie ever made.  Yes, the script was weak, and the acting isn't really too wonderful.  Leonardo DiCaprio has the blandest, most obvious lines I've ever heard, does not act them very well at all, and basically suvrives only on his smile and the fact that everyone knew millions of teenage girls would be swooning.  I didn't understand Billy Zane's character, but he wasn't on very much, so I didn't have to be confused by him a lot.  I do think it's awful that all those girls cried only over 'Leo' and not over the thousands of people who died, but for those who were watching for another reason, there is still a pretty good movie there, in my opinion.  The scope is amazing, with all the sweeping shots, lavish, mostly accurate details, and spectacular effects. Cameron really orchestartes the mood of every scene wonderfully; though some of it is pretty cheesy, for the most part I really was caught up in it. While the acting isn't spectacular, as I said, some of the people turn in pretty good performances.  Kate Winslet did for the most part, though in the action scenes, where she's given the role of hero, instead of doing something with it she just pants away and screams for Leo and does nothing else.  Otherwise, she handles the acting pretty well.  Frances Fisher, Kathy Bates, the captain, the designer of the ship, and the many third-class passengers were also good.  Even though the movie focused on fictional characters and not on these people, there's enough there to really affect you.  Seeing them being so cruelly and unjustly shut up in steerage and not being allowed to get to the lifeboats is a pretty powerful scene.  And just tell me you weren't in some way moved by the mother singing her kids to sleep, the old couple (who were real) hugging each other in bed, the people getting shot and killed by smokestacks, the captain shutting himself in as the windows break, and the band playing on and on and on.  I mean, come on! This really happened!  It was the most affecting part of the movie for me. I guess it was because I was so affected by it that I felt sad when Leo went under.  All the nay-sayers concentrate on the fiction part, which admittenly isn't up to the standards of these scenes, but also is not the only thing there.  Perhas if people just didn't look at the first part and only at the second part, they'd understand one reason why this movie was so successful. Yes, the teenage girls were a big factor, or so we hear, but plenty of other people went two and three times besides them, and they went because they were so affected by it that they just had to see it again.  Maybe it doesn't deserve to be the most successful movie ever made, but it deserves to be a classic, and undoubtedly will be no matter what anyone says.  Yes, it has flaws, but what movie doesn't?  There's more to this movie besides those flaws, if you just look.",7,3,4,15 September 1999
It's a Wonderful Life," A pretty good movie builds up to the one great scene on the bridge
","This movie feels just the same no matter when you watch it, but today it's viewed mainly as a Christmas movie.  Still, no matter when you watch it, you can't help but like it and get something out of it, unless you have no heart at all or have an absolute, unshakeable hatred for movies like this. Throughout the movie, you think George Bailey's a nice guy (James Stewart was great in the role).  You may get a little tired of the endless flashback scenes, but you'll undoubtedly not really be that bored, especially in the electrifying telephone scene with Donna Reed.  Once the flashbacks are dispensed with, you feel sorry for George as he begins a sudden downhill descent.  You hope (okay, you know) his lovable, bumbling guardian Angel Second Class will be able to talk sense into him by showing him what the world would be like had he not been born.  And then it all comes down to the scene where he almost goes crazy, runs back to the bridge and begs God to let him live again.  That is one of the most heart-wrenching scenes I've ever seen in movies; unless you're one of the above-mentioned people with no heart, there's no way you will be able to keep at least a couple of tears from falling.  You will almost certainly be pulled into the scene, right alongside George, begging God to let him live, too.  But if somehow you can prevent the tears from coming, then they'll immediatly come flowing when he runs back home rejoicing and yelling, 'Hello, Bedford Falls!'  Yeah, it is what's come to be called 'Capracorn', but it's utterly genuine and very emotional.  The mood is masterfully orchestrated by Capra and masterfully performed by Stewart.  It's the most, well, wonderful way to close a movie.While that scene and the performance in it are the best things about the movie, that does not mean they're the only good things.  Donna Reed makes a great companion with Stewart (witness that telephone scene), Henry Travers is a pleasent diversion as his guardian angel, and Lionel Barrymore is wonderfully wicked as the devious Mr. Potter.  The whole film is pretty well-done.  Even though everything seems happy, you still do get a little sad knowing George gave up everything.  There is a dark edge to this film, especially when he contemplates suicide.  Nothing happy there at all, but still well-performed and genuinely sympathy-provoking.  While it may be at its best when viewed at Christmas, it's just as good any time of the year and should have a lot of meaning, especially to a depressed or bereaved person.  It's just as wonderful as you've heard, honestly.",9,1,4,12 September 1999
To Kill a Mockingbird," Everything you've heard is true
","This film is just as powerful and well-performed as you've heard.  From the scenes where Scout and Atticus have discussions, to the scene where Scout innocently confronts a member of a lynch mob, to the trial scenes, to the last scene, (featuring Robert Duvall in his film debut, in which he says so much without ever speaking), every moment is masterfully directed and beautifully perfromed.  Gregory Peck really deserved his Oscar for th role of Atticus Finch; his dignified portrayal of a single father called upon to 'do our unpleseant jobs for us' is remarkable.  Not only is he wonderful and eloquent in the courtroom scenes, but his scenes at home are wonderful, too. He seems to be every child's image of the ideal father: stern yet kind, all-knowing, able to explain anything, and yet his kids know he can't do everything, though he can do more than they think.  These scenes also give him a chance to interact with the amazing child actors Mary Badham and Philip Alford, both of whom had never done any acting before this and yet are naturals.  Badham is espicially good in the scenes where she and Atticus discuss things; she senses so much, and yet is still so innocent.  She does a lot of growing up, but so does Alford, as he listens in on his father's talks with the judge and watches his visits to the Robinson home.  His maturing is much easier to see.  Both actors are just as good as Peck; their adventures are amusing and their performances excellent.  Brock Peters is also very good as Tom Robinson, the black man accused of raping a white woman.  You are not manipulated into feeling sorry for him; you just naturally are, thanks to his portrayal and the direction of his scenes. This is a wonderful movie.  I don't know if the book is better, as I haven't read it, but I know the movie is excellent.  Please see it.",9,1,2,6 September 1999
The Sixth Sense," Well-done and chilling
","Being the ignorant teenager that I am, I needed to have my mother explain the ending to me, as it went too fast for me to grasp just what was happening.  After that, though, it made perfect sense and was a fitting conclusion to a pretty good film.  In my opinion, it really wasn't as jaw-dropping, shocking, and/or haunting as other people say, but that's just my opinion.  I didn't see it coming, but I wasn't looking for it.  I still wasn't shocked, though, because it made sense, etc.As for the rest of the movie, I thought it was pretty good.  It could very easily have been done as a cheap, gory horror flick, but in the hands of the director (I forgot his name), it actually exhibits a great deal of intelligence and a nice mix of the supernatural and religion.  Yes, Haley Joel Osmont is very good in a role that requires a good deal more maturity than most kids' roles today.  He has many of the frightening moments, and they're all frightening in his hands.  But he also is effective as the frightened little boy who has a very simple desire we all can relate to: not to be called a freak.  Bruce Willis was just okay, but Toni Collette, who plays Osmont's mother, did a good job, as well.  The story as it is presented is very chilling, if not very scary.  There are quite a few frightening bumps along the way, but none that are truly nightmare-inducing. That's probably because this movie is well above the rest of its genre (Maybe not The Blair Witch Project, but I haven't seen that one.) and fits more into the drama area of movies.  Anyway, well-directed, -acted, and -written (except for some stupid parts), and I do recommend it.",8,0,0,8 October 1999
Rear Window," Surely one of Hitchcock's best
","I saw a restored print of 'Rear Window' at a local movie theater recently. It looks great, especially that shot of Grace Kelly leaning in to kiss James Stewart/the camera.  Were it not for its reputation and a few points that give away its 1950s setting, it could easily pass for a modern movie.It is very good, surely one of the Master's best movies.  Highly entertaining, with great performances from Stewart, Kelly, (Actually likeable for once, and very sexy) and the hilarious Thelma 'Maybe he put her leg in the East' Ritter, and a great script, the film also does have a great deal of tension and suspense in its last half, created as only Hitch can do it, esepcially in the scene (Possible Spoiler) where Raymond Burr enters Stewart's apartment and he keeps taking pictures of him to distract him. It's also highly engrossing from the beginning; like Stewart's character, we really become voyeurs and get caught up in the lives of the people he watches from his window, most of whom hardly even speak. 
A great Hitchcock film, and a great film period.",Null,0,2,7 May 2000
The Wizard of Oz," Succeeds becuase it's got a timeless lesson that we can all relate to
","Every person in America (and most people all over the world) that is over the age of 5, but usually younger, has seen The Wizard of Oz.  Just about all of them have undoubtedly seen it more than once, either on video or on its yearly TV broadcast.  Why is it so popular and such a part of our culture?  My guess would be that it hasn't gotten old one bit, even though it was made 60(!) years ago, and there is a reason for that.  No matter how old you are, no matter what generation you're part of, you can relate to Dorothy (wonderfully played by Judy Garland) as she yearns to break free and find something somewhere else, but when she finds that something, discovers it's not so great because it doesn't have the familiar comforts of home. Home is what matters, or to quote it for the umpteenth time, there's no place like home.  Everyone feels that way, so we can all relate to her because we all know what it feels like.  Yes, it's got marvelous splashes of color, gorgeous scenery and costumes, great acting and wonderful, classic musical numbers, and that's also a large part of its appeal.  But, whether we want to admit it or not, when you narrow it down, the main reason it was seen by so many people in theaters, by even more people on TV, and now by thousands of kids on video, (And some adults, too.  Admit it!) is because it's timeless and has a lesson that is not dated and has never lost its value.  Say you love it cause Judy's got pretty shoes, or because you've watched it every year and it's just a tradition, but when you look deeper, that's the real reason.",9,1,2,15 September 1999
