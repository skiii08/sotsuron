Scarface," SCARFACE (DIDIER BECU)
","Perhaps this could be the best movie ever made and if it's not it's certainly one of those who are burned onto your pupils as what Brian De Palma delivers here is a great piece of cinematographic artwork. First there is the director's touch of Brian De Palma who proves once again he might be one of the best directors ever, there is the superb performance from Al Pacino who is delivering an immortal hero on the big screen (Tony Montana), there are the many different (violent) scenes that you will never forget (the one with the chainsaw, the one in where Tony is sitting in a bath which is as big as most people's living rooms), there are the many superb one-liners (count how many times the word 'f*ck' is used), there are the superb little details (the Pan American-globe that screams 'The world is yours') or the great discomusic from Giorgio Moroder. Nothing can be named that isn't sublime here and it easily is along with 'The Godfather', 'Good fellas' and 'White heat' one of the best gangstermovies ever made!",10,0,1,1 November 2003
The Ring," THE RING (DIDIER BECU)
","Advertised as a horrormovie with a high intelligencegrade 'The Ring' became one of the biggest hits on the horrorvideocircuit and for those who have their doubts it arises above the average horrorstandard. In fact I was asking myself if it really should have been categorized as horror as most of the times director Gore Verbinski (the man from 'Pirates of the Carribean') creates a sort of style in where some David Lynch-style is certainly there! The story itself is simple...there is a videotape around and once you saw it you will die within 7 days. Most of the directors would have made a sort of Friday The 13th with it but director Gore Verbinski let us investigate why such a videotape is made, where it comes from and it is here where the viewer will undersrtand some bits but not the whole thing, not that there is any need to understand the 'Eraserhead'-like movie that will kill you once you've seen it. 'The ring' is a Hollywoodversion from some Japanese cultmovie 'Ringu' and Verbinski did a well job but only he should have chosen some better actors though, and not someone like Naomi Wats.",7,0,0,29 February 2004
Raiders of the Lost Ark," RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (DIDIER BECU)
","Why are we watching movies? You can come up with thousands of reasons but the main reason Spielberg is exploring must be rediscovering the child in us...he did it with so many movies (from ET to Hook) but Indiana Jones must be the ultimate superhero. All is based on the great adventuremovies of the fifties, you know Burt Lancaster and other Rod Taylors, but perhaps it's the budget, perhaps it's the humour (Harrison Ford is funny), perhaps it's the B-movieacting...je ne sais pas but Raiders Of The Lost Ark is adventure at its best. The original of the trilogy (well, you all know Indy 4 is in the make) brings us back to the thirties at where Indiana Jones is set to Cairo to stop the nazis finding the lost ark (a tomb in where the ten commandments are hidden) and along with Marion (a great acting Karen Allen, just shame about the red trousers) they are having adventure after adventure. Cinema without intelligence? Yup, but a ride on the rollercoaster brings you no use of the brains as well and you always wanna ride again...love that picture so much!!!",9,0,0,2 September 2003
G.I. Jane," GI JANE (DIDIER BECU)
","Hmmm...where to start? How does a serious actress like Demi Moore got involved in such crap? 'First blood' might be rated as bull***t but this type of nonsense is just Rambo with tits, point. Of course if you are interested in the crapstory (Demi Moore just wants to prove that a woman can be part of the NAVY Seals) that is the most stupid clich√© one I can think of, you'll say 'GI Jane' is a great movie. Just the performance from Viggo Mortensen made this movie bearable but hell, I can't think of Demi Moore being Rambo (especially not during the last, useless, 30 minutes). Ridley Scott doesn't deserve the credits to make this movie one that comes up for women with equal rights, it's just brainless propaganda for the American army and to make it more attractive they dropped Moore in it. Awful movie.",4,4,9,9 April 2004
Unbreakable," UNBREAKABLE (DIDIER BECU)
","Giving 6 points to Bruce Willis is damn hard for me as he is one of my fave actors (in case you wanna know De Niro is the best) but what could I do??? The story was rather flat, it was all a bit too much like The Sixth Sense, the plot was an anticlimax (just like they had to have a different plot for the sake of it) and some scenes are really not in their places. Why did I gave it a 6 then??? Simply as I was enjoyed by both Willis and Jackson, but the story...come on guys, even The X-Files are more original than that!!!",6,0,0,25 October 2003
Alien: Resurrection," ALIEN : RESURRECTION (DIDIER BECU)
","What do you do when in the final sequel (Alien 3)commander Ripley ( Sigourney Weaver) is dead and you wanna make an other sequel? You just clone her, simple as that. The big thing is of course can Alien 4 give us something that hasn't been showed before. I think not... Alien 4 would have been a brilliant movie if the other three weren't around but now it's just a sort of rip-off from a rip-off. But still the movie works and not in the least because it's been directed by Jeunet (maker of Amelie Poulain) as some special effects (the one in where Ripley enters the lab) are superb and it's always nice to see Winona Ryder back as well. It's time they stop but Alien 4 can be added to the list though.",6,0,1,11 November 2003
12 Monkeys," TWELVE MONKEYS (DIDIER BECU)
","The big problem is where to begin as this movie needs your attention the forthcoming two hours and you better not miss some minutes for getting a coke as there is a danger you can't follow. But good there is also a pause-button. Bruce Willis must travel into a timemachine to find out some antivirus for a virus that made animals rule over the world in 1996. Thanks to some mistakes he first ends up in 1990, then in the First World War and how messed up it all might look like, Terry Gilliam comes up with what must be one of the most intelligent scripts ever. This ex-Monty Phyton man knows exactly how genius SF-stories has to be told like and his choice of cast couldn't have been any better, there is the lunatic Brad Pitt (his performance in the asylum is memorable) and a superb Bruce Willis who proves he is more than some Schwarzenegger-wanna be. It's a movie you can watch over and over again as the script is so weird and complicated (and yet you can follow) that every view gives you other surprises. One of my big favourites.",9,123,203,13 April 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN (DIDIER BECU)
","I am really a sucker if it comes to oldfashioned adventuremovies that's why I like Indiana Jones so much and it's a delight to see that in 2003 a piratemovie has been made just like those with Burt Lancaster. Nothing changed, pirates still drink and they're still smarter than the Marine but this is a perfect movie if you wanna enjoy yourself with some Hollywoodnonsense. And really...the performance of Johnny Depp is splendid!!!",7,0,1,13 November 2003
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," SET YOUR BRAINS TO ZERO!!!!
","Come on people, I am sure that a whole bunch of you are liking the toilethumor of South Park but are just afraid to admit just because it isn't arty!!! Well, to say it with Eric Cartman's words : f.... 'South Park' must be the most brilliant cartoon ever and those who say it's not educating : come on, don't tell us The Flinstones or Scooby Doo made you the people you are now, not? The story is absolutely nonsense (of course) as Phillip and Terrance, the two Canadian filmstars who only fart have a new movie out and all kids want to see it, of course! Once they did, the kids change their language and all they do is swear. Enough is enough and Kyle's mom decided to declare war against...ahum...Canada! In the meantime Kenny has already been killed and sent to hell at where he discovers that Satan has a homosexual affair with Sadam Hussein! Of course our remaining kids must deliver their filmheroes from death, as the American government has decided to put them on the electric chair! South Park, the movie, has become a musical. I kid you not, even a sort of tribute to the classic musical and most of the songs are top! Even if it's kind of hurting for the ears when you're in the theatre hearing Eric Cartman sing! This movie is full of jokes and despite the fact it's not art, it's more humoristic than tons of other comedy crap that is doing the business (perhaps Eddie Murphy can view some episodes from South Park, just a hint....). Of course all those who have seen the TV series would love to see the film and you must as this film has some unique views : the face from Kenny and....the brilliant haircut from Eric! Rent this, really",8,0,0,31 July 2003
The Mummy," THE MUMMY (DIDIER BECU)
","Well, we're living in an age in where old movies are remade with a bigger budget and somewhere that can work but most of the times it's just an excuse for having some special effects and really, from the moment they are too many it gets started to bore you a bit not? Some things are excellent like those crazy scarabees (insects that crawl under the skin) but other scenes are just a bit over the top (the scene in where the mummy evokes a dusttornado). The crazy thing is that this movie balances between good adventure (the Indiana Jonesstyle) and drowning into special effects (the Phantom Menace) plus the acting is really beneath every standard (Brendan Fraser just sucks and Rachel Weisz...well I am not even going to start searching for words, just bad) but all by all a movie you can watch as it is just too professionally made to let you fall asleep.",6,1,2,4 September 2003
Chicken Run," CHICKEN RUN (DIDIER BECU)
",From the makers of Wallace and Grommit as we all know and the story might be a typical Muppetshow-one but still the kind of movie that gives you 90 minutes splendid entertainment. Set in several languages and I am sure you must opt for your own (in Flemish it was done in several dialects). An animationmovie made for young and old! See it!!!,8,0,0,15 November 2003
Sleepy Hollow," SLEEPY HOLLOW (DIDIER BECU)
",I think no one can ever inside the mind of Tim Burton but one thing is clear though : he brought us some of the greatest fantasymovies ever...from Batman to The night before Christmas till this thriller. We are in the 19th Century in a time in where Sherlock Holmes were arising but were still seen as the enfants terribles. Johnny Depp aka Ichabold Crane is sent to some godforgotten town at where he has to do the research for some mysterious murders committed by the headless horseman... No need to spoil the fun as the plot isn't important (it's even pointless) but the gothic atmosphere that is created by Burton is one that is rarely found... Sometimes breathtaking and once again a great Depp.,7,1,2,10 March 2004
Snatch," SNATCH (DIDIER BECU)
","Guy Ritchie has become in short time one of the hippest British directors and this movie is the one that brought him the public fame and what a movie it is!!! It all starts in Antwerp where some gangsters are stealing a 84 Carat Diamond and then you get a lot of personages who only want one thing : that glimmering stone!!! It's definitely not an easy job for the viewer to know who is who...they all have typical gangsternames and Ritchie directs in an ultrafast way (indeed Tarantinolike) that it is only at the end you know which gangs were in the movie (and so seeing the film for a second time won't be a bad thing). But then again this is not about the story as all by all it's nothing more than some slapstick but it's in the way this movie is directed!!! Ultraviolent (one of the main gangster Brick Top thinks that dead bodies are perfect food for pigs) and ultrafunny (just watch Vinnie Jones) and ultraoriginal (the best performance by Brad Pitt I ever saw, and if you're not having British as your mother tongue, you will need subtitles!!!)...and there is even a hilarious dog in it too. Great movie.",10,0,2,24 August 2003
Full Metal Jacket," FULL METAL JACKET (DIDIER BECU)
","Every great director has their own Vietnam movie and so there must be a point at where Kubrick did one as well. In all honesty, it's a shame knowing that this was made by the man who did '2001', 'The shining' or 'Barry Lyndon' but all by all 'Full Metal Jacket' is a watchable movie nontheless. The big problem is that there are two parts that aren't equal...the first hour of the movie is the training and it must be one of the most shocking war propaganda (well, depends how you wanna call it) ever, especially because of the superb acting from R Lee Ermey who plays a totally awol sergeant, but once the troops are landing in Vietnam the movie sucks, and the main reason is that there is just no story, just shooting and that's it, unless you call the war seen through a warphotographer a movie.Watch the first hour over and over, but once they're in Vietnam push the rewind-button!",7,0,0,3 November 2003
Forrest Gump," FORREST GUMP (DIDIER BECU)
","Oscarmovies are mostly the kind of movies that are enjoyable to watch but with a very overrated factor but luckily for me (the movie lasts 3 hours) this movie ain't like this. Believe me, anyone who says this is the best movie ever made must have lost some brain cells but it is just entertainment with a high standard. Forrest Gump shows you the American history of the 21st Century in where anything that is of historical worth is linked with a so-called stupid (from Lennon to Reagan). The acting of Tom Hanks is as usual genius, just one of the best actors ever, and you can start saying this movie is totally Americanized (it is, but never works on the nerves) but the focal points are clear : humour and an outstanding Hanks....",8,2,5,18 October 2003
Bridget Jones's Diary," BRIDGET JONES DIARY (DIDIER BECU)
","I suppose there are hundredthousands women like Bridget Jones around who have a diary in where they note what they have to eat, which make-up they must wear and so on but that doesn't take away the fact that I think it's rather ridiculous. Now they have made a film about such a woman, in fact it's not even bad just embarrassing as this is really Barbieworld. Not one percent of realism in here...or how do you explain that someone with absolutely no political, historical or cultural knowledge becomes a journalist???? Hello??????????? You can torture your brain every second with such questions... And then the choice...choosing between Colin Firth and Hugh Grant. Colin Firth must be the most dull looking man ever and Grant well...I absolutely am tired of his roles as Mr. Perfect, especially sitting next to your wife who constantly is saying how perfect he is. When will Grant be casted for playing a psychopath?",5,2,3,7 March 2004
The Italian Job," THE ITALIAN JOB (DIDIER BECU)
","A mini Cooper was a car with class and the typical British outlook made it perhaps the most cute car ever and I really got dissapointed the day I saw the new model as it just wasn't what it used to be. Do I need to say I had exactly the same feelings the day I saw this movie? The original movie was a very British one with Michael Caine doing his flawless British role but even if the director may pretend it's not a remake, we all know it is... Mind you this movie itself isn't so bad, I mean you can watch it till the end but at the end you just have one feeling : what have I done the last two hours? Watching a mediocre movie that is based on wasted talent (Charlize Theron and Edward Norton) and flashy cars in a style like 'The fast and the furious'. Good for kids who want nothing or for old men like me who wanna test their homecinema but this ain't of any cinematographic worth.",6,1,2,9 November 2003
Cast Away," CAST AWAY (DIDIER BECU)
","There are two ways to see this movie, the good and the bad way.... Let's start with the good one...if a movie depends on the acting of one actor then he has to be brilliant, especially for a movie that lasts 3 hours and the choice of Tom Hanks is (again) brilliant as he is a superb actor. The story of a succesfull businessman who lands on a desolated island is intriguing (especially when he lost his mind...just imagine what you would do!!!). Of course it's all a bit too Hollywood to be real but still a tour de force for Hanks who once again plays in the sort of movie the whole world talks about. And then the bad thing : hmmmm this whole movie is sponsored by Fedex, and you wonder why they haven't put some commercial trailers in it.... shameless to the point. But all by all more than just a good movie!!!",7,1,1,11 November 2003
American Psycho," AMERICAN PSYCHO (DIDIER BECU)
","A good friend of mine don't wanna see the movie just because he thinks the film can only be a letdown because of the brilliance of the book, I myself never read the book so I can watch it without prejudices that a good book never can match the equality on celluloid. The story is known...a great businessman Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) lives a double life : at office he's the arrogant businessman who cares about the design of his visitcards but outside he is a serial killer (prostitutes are his fave targets) and his life that is dominated by designers and extreme care for the way you look like, but he also is addicted to pornmovies and yuppiemusic (before he starts killing someone, he first reviews a cd...all yuppiemusic like Whitney Houston, Genesis and Huey Lewis And The News). We all know our Patrick Batemans in our world (perhaps your manager huh?) and Christian Bale plays his role in a perfect way, you just hate him from the early start and you just hope he'll be caught as soon as possible, perhaps it's jealousy. The film itself is filmed like the decors Bateman lives in, all pretty cold and no real depth (the kind of yuppies who pretend to be it while their life is just one bulb), never that violent (except the images afterwards) and tons of sex...and for oldies like us, great songs from the eighties! I think this movie could have been better but still an absolute must see for thrillerfanatics.",7,0,1,5 September 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," TERMINATOR 3 (DIDIER BECU)
","I normally don't give that much about sequels but I admit from the moment I knew there was a third Terminator to be made, it was the movie I was most looking forward to... And you can tell that it is a useless sequel, you can tell it's a shame a third one is made and all that other stuff but one thing is sure : from all actionmovieheroes there is only one king and that's Arnold just because he doesn't take himself that seriously... This is more comic than Daredevil, The Hulk and other X-Men's... The story itself is so simple : once again a terminator must travel back to the past to protect John Connor (nice role for Nick Stahl) and his forthcoming wife Kate Brewster (a more than charming role from upcoming star Claire Danes). And then there is that other terminator the female one (played by Kristanna Loken) and that's perhaps the only letdown in the film as she looks like your dreambabe but she doesn't have the evil touch, still very funny to watch... The moment I walked out of the theatre I told my friend that T3 is actually a copy from T2 and that's what it is, just the chases and jokes are different, but hey hey...what chases and jokes they are!!! The sarcasm of Schwarzenegger is superb (the movie is full of memorable one-liners) or the images of Schwarzenegger carrying a coffin on the shoulder while having a machine gun in the other hand is just great...and I could go on and on as this movie is directed by Jonathan Mostow (famous for U571) in a very professional way, I really doubt it if Cameron could have delivered a better job... The big problem is that most of the critics wanna slash down the movie but they just can't as this is too brilliantly made and after 12 years Arnie still rules and the last words of Arnie ('We'll meet again') says enough that we will have a T4 if only Arnie won't be president of the US in 2015...",8,0,0,17 August 2003
The Shining," THE SHINING (DIDIER BECU)
","For those who take the horrorsection not for serious (I know there is plenty of crap out there) let them see this masterpiece as Stanley Kubrick can be an example of how great horror must be done as it's both great on the scale of cinematographic skills and horrorthrills. The story is quite known : an ordinary family (well, what's in a name?) are taking care of an isolated hotel and even if the cook warns them what happened with the family before who took care after the hotel, Jack is sure that nothing can happen with him, he has the job of his life.... The movie is really superb and that has to do with three immortal performances : Jack Nicholson is the devil himself and along with 'One flew over the cuckoo's nest' it might be his best role, Shelley Duvall plays brilliant as the scary wife and the little Danny Lloyd is superb as well (wait till you hear him saying Red Rum!!!!). A masterpiece.",10,0,1,31 October 2003
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," TERMINATOR 2 (DIDIER BECU)
","Is there someone around who hasn't seen it yet? And perhaps more, is there someone around who doesn't like it? It's probably the best actionmovie ever made simply as it's cool cos that's what's this movie is all about. Arnold Schwarzenegger is simply the best actor they could find to play this role (and hey, he's even funny) and the new robot the T-1000 is superb as well. Jesus Christ, there isn't one Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steven Segal or Stallone-movie around who captures 1% of the brilliance of this godlike movie. Brains at zero, yes sir, but being dumb isn't always so dumb...",8,0,0,19 October 2003
Heartbreak Ridge," LOVING THE BULLET
","'Heartbreak ridge' is a bit of a dubious movie as you're getting one of the best Eastwood-performances ever but sadly enough it's done in a rather weak movie. Mind you, it's all by all a very entertaining movie which never bores but it raises so many questions that you can't escape the feeling that director Eastwood forget all sense of reality, especially knowing that this same man shoot pictures about jazzlegends and so.... The story is absolute nothing....an American Marine-officer who lives for the army must train a bunch of useless t**ts who are just caring about rapmusic and girls...and you get it, Eastwood makes it possible to train them as an elite-platoon who were of crucial sense in the Grenada-war. The film lasts 130 minutes and not once there is a sense of criticism even if the soldiers (and even Eastwood himself) are humilated in the worst way there is. The whole movie the soldiers are complaining that they have to do some sports but once the call is there for war, you see them carrying the stars and stripes. Yeah, pacifists will have no one good word for it, be sure of it. But as said just like if you are considering to throw this film in the bin you are facing the strong performance from Eastwood who must play his most coolest performance ever! The man with the iron face is full with scars from battles he fought (he was a hero in all the big wars) and he comes over as the most dangerous killing machine ever, even Dirty Harry would run for his life! The rest of the movie you will forget the day you wake up again, naaah watch it ... it's entertainment but you better not tell anyone that you picked up something interesting from it....",7,0,2,27 July 2003
In the Name of the Father," IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER (DIDIER BECU)
","I don't think there is anyone around who can dislike this movie as it's directed in such a magnificent way that there are times you wish every movie could have the same impact even if strange enough director Jim Sheridan never really would make it in the director-scene. This is the story about the Guildford Four, the story of four people who happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. Once again London is haunted by an IRA-bomb and as the justice don't want to be blamed another time they must find some 'guilty' and so it happens that some Irish outsiders are in the area of an exploded pub. The whole family of Conlon (even his father who must be so honest it reaches the laughable) are sent to prison at where they are absolutely hated and getting the hardest regime a prisoner can get. In the meantime the real terrorists are caught but the British government is too proud to convince that they made a mistake and little by little we see people torn apart as they are condemned for something they never did... Let's thank God this was a British production as never Sheridan chooses for Oscar-sentiment, it never goes over the top and it's just given as documentaryinformation, but mind you, the truth itself is shocking enough. Once again splendid performances from Daniel Day Lewis and Pete Postlewaite who plays the role of the father. Superb movie.",8,2,4,19 August 2003
54," 54 (DIDIER BECU)
","Is it my fault or what? Why if I wanna praise a movie, I have to see that it's being turned down by most of the IMDB-voters? Anyway, '54' tells the story of the legendary Studio 54-discotheque in New York that was huge in the days of disco and that was known for its orgies, extravaganzas and endless days of disco. It tells the story of a Shane who lives at the other side of NY and who is picked up by the boss, who makes him a bartender. He soon sees what has to be done to make it (gaysex included) but he forgets his poor origin and climbs up to the ladder of stardom. '54' is a perfect movie for anyone who seek decadence with a discosoundtrack and for those who are at the end of their 30's, they all know the party's definitely over and fun never sounded so good. A real masterpiece that tells a real important part of popular music's history.",8,3,6,6 April 2004
Gandhi," GANDHI (DIDIER BECU)
","Every year has its movies that mankind has to see. It seems you haven't lived if you haven't seen Schlinder's List and in 1982 you must have been some associal monster when not taking care about this movie. Anyway, the person Gandhi may not be mixed up with this movie as how great Gandhi must be as living person the movie itself comes over quite dated twenty years later. The problem is that Gandhi follows too much the strict base of any other biography and apart from Gandhi who stands up against the British colonists there is no real story. A movie that lasts about 4 hours could have explained more the killing for instance as all by all you still are left with mysteries and someone who sat down such a long time wants to know more, not? Attenborough has never been a brilliant director, he just chooses both his subjects and examples well. Is the movie overrated then? Not at all, it even is a movie that has to be seen (for the extreme good performances from Ben Kingsley alone) but I can't just escape the feeling that in 1982 I would have rated it with four stars whereas now three.",7,4,8,3 March 2004
Pearl Harbor," PEARL HARBOR (DIDIER BECU)
","Of course it was the movie everyone had to see, it was also one of the first movies that was used for the marketingtechnique that everyone should have a DVDplayer but what a waste of time, what a waste of talent, what a waste of movie in fact... The story is known, even your 12old year kid will know what the Japs did and so it couldn't have surprised at all, but still it did... The attack from the Japs belongs (just like the first 30 minutes of Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan') to the best what I ever saw in warmovies. Spectacular, frightening and with a rarely seen reality-factor. The speeches in the White House are good as well, the ones from the Japanese emperors as well but (and that's 2 hours) the lovestory sucked... It was boring, and it was a shame that they didn't opt to make a warmovie in historical style like 'The longest day' as then it could perhaps have been the best warmovie ever but indeed we must see a dreadful lovestory...and why such a warevent is pointed out to two good pilots is beyond me, it's a slap in the face for all families who lost someone there. Typical example from how Hollywood can destroy good ideas.",6,0,1,28 March 2004
Saving Private Ryan," SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (DIDIER BECU)
","I saw this movie is included in the Top 250 and to be quite honest, I just don't understand why. The most realistic warmovie ever made? Perhaps because of the special effects (those first 20 minutes are indeed horryfying) but the sole reason why that is like that is just because 'Saving private Ryan' is the kind of warmovie they don't make any longer, but believe me, if 'The longest day' or any other warepic would have been made these days it would have been exactly the same as this Spielbergmovie. Surely not a bad movie at all, even worth your time (and even more than that) but Spielberg tries a bit too hard to make it an anthem to those who lost their live in one of the biggest tragedies the world has known, but then again every war is a tragedy (I see no difference in a soldier dying in France or somewhere in Palestina). Spielberg is not afraid to show the cruelity of war and if you are softhearted you will close your eyes more than once. Good movie, even a bit more than that but just don't overrate it as well.",7,2,3,2 November 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," WO HU CANG LONG (DIDIER BECU)
","Martial arts for intelligent people, that's perhaps the movie in a nutshell. Knowing the hype (and seeing it has been ranked high) I absolutely have to see this Chinese masterpiece but there are some points though that need to be said. Of course this movie is a superb masterpiece of both costumes, landscapes, visual arts and martial arts but it has been done before, just think of Bertolucci's 'The last emperor' but people need their hypes now and then so saying this is a masterpiece is both true and false. The story itself can be reduced to a simple fairy tale but that's the attraction behind it as well as Ang Lee tried to give a sort of social view of the ancient China. A very wonderful movie but it'd be wrong to say this is the only martial arts-movie that is worth seeing as that's what critics want us to believe.",7,0,0,13 April 2004
Good Will Hunting," GOOD WILL HUNTING (DIDIER BECU)
","Normally I hate films with good messages but this one was different and there are different reasons for it. Just let me tell that I couldn't believe my eyes when I noticed this movie was ranked among the 250 best movies ever as that's certainly not the case as it's the kind of movie you have seen before...It's the story about some janitor (Matt Damon) who happens to be a math-genius but he prefers to hang out with his friends (Ben Affleck) beating up some guys. Everything changes till he met Sean, a psychiatrist (Robin Williams). Matt Damon plays his role in a perfect way and he could be one of the better actors of these days as he plays the streetguy in a pure James dean/Marlon Brando-way, tons better than Affleck who seems a bit lost here. And finally a normal Robin Williams and it's a shame noticing how great his acting is, how much he can handle and knowing he wasted so many talent in c**p like 'Toys'.'Good will hunting' is a great movie that deserves two hours of your time, but not a place in the Top 250.",7,1,4,5 April 2004
The Elephant Man," the elephant man
","David Lynch always used to be one of my favorite directors even if most of his movies leaves me puzzled. Perhaps 'The elephant man' is his most easy one as after all Lynch only tells you a heartbreaking story. The elephant man is in fact John Merrick (John Hurt), a man who has been trampled by elephants and due to this, he is totally deformed. In the Victorian London he's a freak who's been used at carnivals for people to have a look at. One day Doctor Frederick Treves sees the man and decides to take care of him. John Merrick got a room in the local hospital but soon we'll see that the doctor invites all types of persons from the high society who want to see the freak, even if they all can cover it up like some tea-parties. Anyway, it looks like John Merrick got a sort of life in where he seeks the little pleasures of life. The real tragic is that there is a sort of battle going on who owns the freak, is it the freak show-owner or the doctor? What Lynch is showing us is to see who actually the freak is : the poor creature or the crowd who are so curious that they forgot there is actually a human being behind the tragic body? One of the more accessible films by Lunch for sure that got the full support from the public who were falling for this tragic story.",10,2,3,4 June 2005
Ghostbusters," GHOST BUSTERS (DIDIER BECU)
","This is one of the classics of the eighties, I even had the (terrible) soundtrack on vinyl but the big question of course is : is it fun to watch in 2003? Pretty annoying question as I never liked it that much anyway and that was because it wasn't funny at all... I went through most of the reviews on this page and it must have something to do with the fact I never found Murray a funny guy but I can't think of one joke I particulary liked in this movie. Murray, Aykroyd and Ramis are the three immortal ghostbusters but twenty years later it all looks so crappy, it's just like a lasershow from some discotheque and damn difficult to believe this was one of the most expensive productions ever... It surely remains entertainment that you can watch for 90 minutes but all by all one of the most overrated blockbusters ever.",6,2,4,17 August 2003
Moulin Rouge!," MOULIN ROUGE (DIDIER BECU)
","Strange how one of the biggest things in Hollywood, namely the musical, has vanished the last decades as the recent years we only saw 'Dancer in the dark' and 'Chicago' making it big and of course this superb masterpiece from Baz Luhmann. Baz does something strange, he brings us back in the early 1900 namely in the decadent Paris at where we are invited to the strangest parties at Le Moulin Rouge. This is a musical that's never been done before, as even if we are hundred years back we hear modern popsongs (Bowie, Madonna, Nirvana) performed in a pure Broadwaystyle and it works splendid. It tells us the impossible story of a poor novelist who has to win a dancer Nicole Kidman who is destinated to sell her body, and for the sake of the Moulin Rouge she must marry the evil duke who put all his money in the cabaret. The cinematographic stills are amazing, so are the costumes and decors as this is indeed like you're in the middle of some decadent show. One of the most inspiring movies I recently saw and again an amazing Kidman.",8,1,2,13 April 2004
The Evil Dead," EVIL DEAD (DIDIER BECU)
","'Evil Dead' will be known for its classic merits in the horrorgenre and it might be one of the pioneermovies in the slash and splattergenre but this doesn't take away the fact that this movie is hopelessly dated. Sam Raimi worked with a very low budget and was helped by the Coen-brothers with whom he was living on a flat, the theory says that they even used motorbikes to film some shoots. Anyway, the guts are there and it is great to see a movie just like it's been made by some students but the horroreffect I read about here on these pages isn't here at all (just watch The Texas Chainsaw Massacre to see the difference) and it's not very funny (sometimes you can't help of thinking to see some creepy Muppetcreatures rather than scary zombies, especially when the zombies are completely destroyed...blood never looked as much as ketchup as here). Dreadful movie? No you can watch it, but as said just too dated to thrill us still...",6,0,2,5 November 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," KILL BILL VOL 1 (DIDIER BECU)
","Is mister Quentin Tarantino a genius? After having watched this one I know the answer is a big yes, perhaps even the best director I can think of and not because out of a sudden you must forget Hitchcock or Kubrick but just because Tarantino makes them different, his movies are things you haven't seen before, he does with violence what Lynch does with the ununderstandable, he is just God... Moneywise I also would like to see Kill Bill in one turn rather than being split up in a volume 1 and 2 but knowing that I wasted tons of money for movies that aren't even worth the time, so not to speak about the money, I am excited to run back to the theatre the day they released vol.2 All the ingredients for a Tarantinomovie are there...superb soundtrack (James Last will never be the same again!!!), great acting from actors you don't expect from (Daryl Hannah is breathtaking), unexpected takes (there is a mangacartoon included) and violence. Violence is the word that makes Tarantino the man and I really hate it if I see that a director is accused of gloryfying death and violence where as a president who sends troops to death is seen as normal. I mean it's just fun...just entertainment and there will be no one around who will take up a sword pretending he is The Bride... The Bride is Uma Thurman who takes revenge on Bill and the gang... You see the story couldn't be more simplier, a bride has been beaten to death (4 years in a coma) and everyone who was at the 'party' got killed and once Uma wakes up she must take reference and kill the gang...and Bill will be the last. At least that's what we think as I am sure that vol.2 will be full of surprises. One of the best movies ever made, point!!!",9,0,1,2 November 2003
Mission: Impossible II," MISSION IMPOSSIBLE II (DIDIER BECU)
","Ever saw someone jump from rock to rock? Ever someone riding a motorbike on one wheel while shooting (and right in the target!)? In fact you did you must have seen Mission Impossible II, and really it's 2003 and there should be a law that stop such movies!!! I absolutely am sick of seeing movies that are made like videoclips in where nothing happens! Once they said Rambo was the lowest factor a film could have, well at least I enjoyed that but this sort of cinema is just made with expensive techniques...that's it point!!! 90 useless minutes in where Tom Cruise has to search a sort of virus (Chimaera) produced by some majorcompany that wanna make money by vitalising it worldwide. Phew, I hated it really...only good point if that counts : the performance (not the acting) from Tom Cruise.",2,0,2,4 September 2003
A Bug's Life," A BUGS LIFE (DIDIER BECU)
","Little by little the Pixarstudios are taking over the kingdom of cartoonworld and even if it might be a bit 'too real' they are making fascinating movies. 'A bug's life' tells the story of a colony of ants that are terrorized by grasshoppers who demand from them that they give them every year food so they can sit on their lazy asses. Everything goes well till some ant Flik (known for being the Baron Von Munchausen in his colony) is responsible for having the collected food dissapear, he is sent to town to find some fighting bugs who can make an end to the domination of the grasshoppers. It's lovely and somewhat entertainment for the whole family (apart from the very cruel end, so be aware kids) and another hit for Pixar, just one thought though : it was a bit too similar with Chicken Run, but a lovely 90 minutes guaranteed.",7,1,1,11 April 2004
Life Is Beautiful," LA VITA E BELLA (DIDIER BECU)
","What hasn't been said about this movie that hasn't been said before? Indeed, absolutely nothing as 'La vita e bella' is just the kind of movie that has to be seen and that has to be watched over as soon as it is on the television screen. A comedy that is filmed around the dramatic adventures on some concentration camp and Roberto Begnini isn't the sort of preacher (certainly not at the end) and as viewer you simply don't know what to do : laughing or crying... You know that laughing is a very bitter thing to do in situations like these but still it works... Some scenes are heartbreaking, or may I say the lowest common factor humankind can fall into (the scene at where Begnini expects help from some 'befriended' SS-general turns out to be finding a solution for a stupid riddle). There isn't a real message and if there is one then it must be keep on smiling. 'La vitta e bella' won 3 Oscars, and for Christsake, it might have made Begnini crazy, but it's still too less...",9,2,5,1 March 2004
Where Eagles Dare," WHERE EAGLES DARE (DIDIER BECU)
","I like warmovies, especially those epics from the sixties and so I started my ride of 3 hours hoping to see some oldfashioned warscenes with American heroes and German nazibastards (cos after all that's how American warmovies are made like, not?) but 'Where Eagles Dare' is more the sort of sleeping pill you can use in case the pharmacy is closed cos  it's so slow that you easy can smoke a fag outside and having not missed one thing. The problems of this movie are clear : a) dull acting from both Eastwood and Burton. I like Eastwood a lot but in this movie you really can replace him by some statue. b) the story is far too complicated. All they have to do is to free a British soldier but for some reason (Alistair Maclean is the real reason) this has to be a wicked spy-story that no one understands...or it must be because I was standing outside smoking a fag. c) it's far too dated and too unrealistic. War is cruel you know but Eastwood and Burton are hanging on some cablelifts just like they're sitting in a chair, not that I'm a purist but let Stallone do that and at least he should have yelled something. d) The Germans here are portrayed as the most stupid soldiers ever, not that I care that much about it but for Eastwood and Burton these soldiers are just like some mosquitos they have to kill.... Mind you, this movie itself isn't that bad, you can even watch it but there are so many great warmovies being made that it just wouldn't be fair to rank this one along them.",5,5,11,2 September 2003
Reservoir Dogs," RESERVOIR DOGS (DIDIER BECU)
","Thank God the cinema has their hypes as well and Tarantino must be the last wunderkind of the celluloid dreams as out of nothing Tarantino was seen as one of the most influential directors ever, and even if the filmography isn't that stunning (unbelievable he made Four Rooms as well) he made some of the best movies ever and as you all know Reservoir Dogs is such one... Why exactly? The acting of course, the dialogues of course and whether you like it or not, the admiration of brutal violence. What directors like de Palma or Scorsese were hiding is by Tarantino exposed till you puke... just watch how many dialogues are spoken by actors who are bleeding till death. Or the famous scene in where a cop looses an ear (all on the rhythm of Steelers Wheel's 'Stuck in the middle with you'...when an ear is cut the personages usually die after two seconds, by Tarantino they are living for 15 minutes or more while he isn't ashamed to make some close up's from the wounds... And the script, Jesus Maria...after some minutes you are so fascinated that you even forget you have to pee... Was Pulp Fiction better? Perhaps, perhaps not...just a totally different movie and you are only hoping for one thing : Tarantino watch some Japanese B-movies and go back to your roots!!!",10,1,3,27 August 2003
Pulp Fiction," PULP FICTION (DIDIER BECU)
","Quentin is often accused of stealing ideas from lost B-movies but what the hell??? If only all directors would have his freshness. Better than Kill Bill or Reservoir Dogs or even Jackie Brown??? I really am not interested in the answer as after all Tarantino hasn't a huge list but they all changed the landscape of current filmography. Just like no one other Tarantino makes 'lost actors' arise...or tell us how you can explain that Tarantino makes a superb actor out of Travolta? The dialogues are genius as well and it are the kind of movies you watch over and over, some scenes like the one in where Willis is in the hand of some sadistic gay is genius. Too violent? It would have been more violent!!! I hate statements but if there is one than it's Quentin belonging to the cream of the crop!!!",9,1,2,11 November 2003
Titanic," TITANIC (DIDIER BECU)
","I used to be one of those who absolutely were not interested in seeing the movie but as it was on telly I decided to watch anyway...and look how wrong I am, I even gave it 4 stars.... Now the story itself is one without surprises as after all it's about a boat that hit an iceberg and I knew before that it's the kind of movie at where housewives are searching for handkerchiefs but the truth is that James Cameron (the Terminatorman) has used all Hollywoodcliches in the best way that can be used... The special effects are enormous and the interaction between Leonardo and Kate is one of a rare breed (and no I am not a Leonardo-fan at all...). Perhaps the whole thing was a bit too commercialised (but so was 'Gone with the wind') and it's not the best movie ever and even 11 Oscars was a bit too much but absolutely worth 4 hours of your life.",8,3,5,28 October 2003
Kingpin," KINGPIN (DIDIER BECU)
","Made by the creators of Dumb and Dumberer...so this says enough! The story is about an ex-champion from bowling Roy (Woody Harrelson) who due to the influence of a magnificent Bill Murray ripped off people by telling them he was an amateur while in fact he's the king of the bowling...but good songs never last long and as some people took revenge, the king of bowling is now a sort of Captain Hook as he lost a hand. The rest of Roy's career is just a sum up of alcohol till he meet the hilarious Ishmael (Randy Quaid). Ishmael is a complete stranger to this world as whole his life he lived in a Jewish community that even don't know the existence of a hotel.... All what follows then are ultrahilarious situations in where Woody Harrelson, Randy Quaid and Bill Murray play one of the best roles in their lives...almost every joke is superb, especially the part in where Roy (Harrelson) is offered 1 million dollar by a millionaire if he may sleep with Ishmael...of course this refers to his role in 'Indecent Proposal'. Food for the dumb? Yup but a comedy must make you laugh and Kingpin does that 90 minutes so....",7,1,3,25 August 2003
Ben-Hur," OVERRATED BUT STILL CLASSIC ONE...
","And then there was Ben Hur... Everybody must have seen the film tons of times (every Easter telly shows it) and there are some things I don't understand.... Overwhelmed with Oscars, being one of the most expensive productions ever (if it wasn't a success it would have meant the bankrupcy of MGM!) but is it so much different from all those other long big movies...? Is it so much better than Cleopatra, does it differ so much from The Ten Commandments or is it so much more original than Quo Vadis? You know it isn't... The sole thing that made this movie so outstanding is the use of a wide screen and the money that was set free to build up such an unique set. The chariots-scene is of course a classic but I am convinced that it has more to do with the developped technology rather than William Wyler's talent cos after all he was a frequent director but all of them are nothing but nice pictures. The acting isn't great either... Charlton Heston plays his role in a classic way, you can even say nothing bad about it but come on, it's not outstanding, not? The scenes with Jesus...well, we saw them all in those other Biblefilms and also the story of Ben Hur lasts 3 hours and a half but can be told in a few lines, not? But as said this movie is so classic, so important that everyone must have seen it and I even dare to give it an 8 (most of the movies I watch get a 7, mind you) but 42 years later it absolutely doesn't deserve to be titled as best movie ever as so many do.",8,2,4,5 August 2003
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," STAR WARS (DIDIER BECU)
","There have been written thousands of reviews concerning 'Star Wars' and the big problem is what can man add which hasn't been add before? Absolutely nothing, perhaps that this blockbuster from 1977 was the start of it all. When you see it more than 25 years later it might look a bit dated in some ways but you know that this movie was responsible for oner of the biggest impacts on the silver screen ever that you forget it all. This is the ultimate wet dream for anyone who like to be blown away by some fantasyadventure, hell...every second of this movie has been spoken about, theories were given just like if 'Star Wars' was the most important thing ever and in our little fantasyworld it perhaps can be... A movie to be see over and over and an epic that will arise above all, people still will watch 1000 years later, if only we live...",9,1,1,30 October 2003
Hart's War," HART'S WAR (DIDIER BECU)
","You can start by telling this is the kind of movie that take a leap with historical facts and it can be the case, but with all respect, almost all Hollywoodmovies about the Second World War are like that. I mean it can't be fun for any soldier who is daily faced with death and certainly not for those who are in a workcamp run by nazis. But good that's not my point, if you wanna have historical facts that are right then you have to read encyclopedias or so.Thing id that 'Hart's war' brings back one of my fave genres and that's warmovies! Okay movies like that might have been made with tons during the 50's and the 60's but these days they are rare and that's the biggest merit of the film plus a brilliant (as always) performance from the most underrated actor ever : Bruce Willis...",6,2,5,22 October 2003
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (DIDIER BECU)
","It's rather rare that a sequel is better than the original but with this one it's definitely the case and certainly most of all, this was the best one of all them. Why? Dunno why but the majority of the film is build around the evil of Darth Vader and his empire (more than once you will think of Third Reich-resemblances). The story itself is rather thin (in fact there is none as it feels like you're watching some episode, the movie doesn't even has an ending) but all the characters that made Star Wars such an immortal saga are back, and how... If you only watch a limit amount of movies in your life this one must be included...",9,0,1,30 October 2003
True Romance," ONE OF THE BETTER Tarantino
","Since 'Pulp Fiction' has become such a huge success, the film industry thought it was cool to pen down the name of Tarantino even if he was involved for 5 seconds or less, but this gem is one of the sweet exceptions. It's like the Tarantino-movie Quentin never made as this movie goes down the screen with a very high speed. Clarence (an incredible Christian Slater) is a kind of weirdo who lives in his own dreamworld (he even has Elvis as an imaginary friend) whose life got tumbled up when his colleagues give him a hooker as a present. Clarence first can't believe that Alabama (Patricia Arquette in her best role ever) is the girl of his dreams, she even, likes obscure kung fu-movies but when he finds out that she's a hooker, he decides to show what real love stands for and kills her pimp so they can start a whole new life. The sole thing is that instead of a bag of clothes, Clarence came home with a bag of cocaine. A real cat and mouse play starts with some incredible small roles (Dennis Hopper, James Gandolfini, Samuel L Jackson and an unrecognizable Brad Pitt).",4,5,15,13 April 2006
Donnie Darko," DONNIE DARKO (DIDIER BECU)
","A movie that starts with the best band ever (Echo and The Bunnymen) and ends with the best song ever (Mad world by Tears For Fears), can anything better? Yes of course but not a lot of movies were as good as this one and saying I have probably only understand 90% of it, the rest is up to my (and your) imagination...it's a movie that leaves you with questions, but that's how it is supposed to be like...to think about... Not creepy in the traditional horrorsense but just creepy cos our world is...the slotscene says enough. I think I am speechless...classic this one!!!",8,1,2,25 October 2003
Goodfellas," GOODFELLAS (DIDIER BECU)
","I absolutely can't remember how many times I have seen this movie but every time I discover new things I saw not before and I am sure it's one of those rare movies that are made to watch over and over just because it might perhaps be the best movie ever made, and if not it certainly is in the Top 10 of it somewhere. There are so many stars in here... Martin Scorsese who just is the ideal proof that a director can be a personality himself, someone who you can recognize from style (I am sure that you only will can come up with 20 directors of so whose style can be recognized), Robert De Niro who is just the best actor of all time, full stop, Ray Liotta who perhaps could have join De Niro if only he had some better roles to play as in here he is superb, Joe Pesci who plays the ideal gangster who is nuts, Lorraine Bracco who plays the perfect role of the woman that will always stay loyal to her gangsterhusband, the soundtrack (just remember how Sid Vicious' 'My way' or Derek and The Dominos' 'Layla' has been used). I am sure I will rewatch this movie soon, for the 20th or 30th time perhaps...and indeed better than all gangstermovies ever made.",9,0,0,8 November 2003
