The New World," It's an acquired taste, or in Malicks case, style.
","I think with Malicks' films, you either connect with it or you don't. I did just that with 'The Thin Red Line' and was curious to see if I would with 'New World'. I guess I did in a different way, although maybe after more viewings(DVD), I may be able to break it down better.Quite honestly movie studios just don't make movies like this anymore, and if they do it's not with the budget that Malick had. His primary use of letting the images speak for themselves sans dialog is huge here. And with that, his musical scores, this one by James Horner(Braveheart/Titantic), play a integral part with the lack of dialog.No special effects, no artificial lighting, and I believe shot 80% with a 'steadycam' for full 360's(no track) gives you breathtaking scenery in the most natural sense. A hard edge, realism. I thought the acting was first rate, again since most was non-speaking. The ability to convey emotion without speaking has got to be the epitome of real 'acting'. Farrell, Kilcher, and Bale played the parts respectively.I'm not sure what creative license was taken in terms of the story. My wife is a teacher and recognized many things that she believed to be true, but I'm sure certain events were altered. All in all it's a powerful film. But one that requires the viewer to 'let go', and not be swayed by the current Hollywood style of pace and flow that movies today are filmed by.",8,5,11,3 February 2006
Memento," Slick and very well done.
","I have owned this DVD for a while now and just finally watched it. I also must say I saw 'Insomnia' before I saw this so I was familiar with the director(C.Nolan). First off, the editor of this film should have gotten an Oscar. You really have to have an open mind to watch this. I viewed this with my folks(55/56 yrs of age) and they liked 'Insomnia'. They did not get this and were visibly puzzled with the sequence of last-to-present film making. I thought Guy Pearce was great, but I'm biased as I liked him in both 'L.A. Confidential' and 'Ravenous'. It's certainly a thinkin' mans movie, much like 'The Usual Suspects' and has a similar climatic ending. This movie is really made for DVD, so you can view it over and over to get additional glimpse of events missed. Also kudos to getting a major studio to finance this. I would have love to been at that Hollywood 'power-lunch' when the producers pitched this. I have found that most people who 'get-it' love it and those who don't hate it. Memento is certainly not a mainstream thriller, but it has what it takes to be a great film.",8,0,2,18 November 2002
