Blade Runner 2049," Did NOT get the hate for Blade Runner 2049. At all.
","Blade Runner 2049 was gorgeous. That much, no one can deny. As someone who was only generally understanding of the first Blade Runner film, I have to admit that I had a lot of catching up to do. However, after some research (and a genuine pledge to finally watch the original in its entirety), I can thoroughly say that this movie does not deserve the hate it has gotten. I have honestly never written a movie review.From start to finish, the movie was beautiful in its essence, using many geometric shapes, and also overlaying environments with different elemental patterns. I was entranced by just about every scene. Usually, a film can handle doing this for a few consequential scenes, but the fact that Blade Runner 2049 seems to do it so artistically and seamlessly in every scene seems nothing less than magic.For all the viewers lambasting that the only true lure is the feminine form, and that they are likely to only think of the female characters as eye-candy for their later self-gratifications... Ew. Methinks most of the fault in this area lies in the fact that you view almost all women as objects in movies. The women in the movie (while very idealistic, but hey, they are REPLICANTS) serve very important roles, and do not merely fall to being props. I was happy with the roles they served.The story, while a bit drawn out, is nonetheless full of emotion and feeling, making it easy to stay with. It may not have been a very fast-pasted, easy-to-understand sci-if story, but it was extremely fleshed-out. The questions I was left with didn't seem to be pointing toward a sequel, but rather a need to re-watch. Plot-holes that some users have pointed to in the fact that 'K' COULDN'T have denied his programming and lied to his superiors because he's a replicant is completely moot because that is what Deckard in-fact did. And also why the whole idea that created beings cannot deviate. A central theme in the original as well.I could go on and on about the complaints that I've seen, but I honestly think it would fall on deaf ears. This movie was sooo soooo well worth the cost of renting. I hadn't expected much after the dismal reviews, but I was oh, so pleasantly surprised. It's rare that I find the reviews to be oh-so completely wrong. But I'm glad I took a chance. Everyone involved (especially Ana de Armas!) should be so proud of what they created. All the creepy weirdos who subscribe to the 'if I can't see myself having sex with it, it isn't valid!' school of cinematography, no need to review this movie.",9,3,12,18 August 2018
