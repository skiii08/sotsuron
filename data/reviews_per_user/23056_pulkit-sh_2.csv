The Avengers," A Marvel from Marvel
","Absolutely Brilliant!!!!...not a single dull moment in this movie. Great to see Robert Downey Jr. after Sherlock Holmes...right on the button. He is having amazing sense of representing Tony Stark in the Iron Man franchise and now in The Avengers. Captain America, Thor were fabulous in this movie. The action was top notch. Scarlett was OK and I missed Edward Norton as Hulk although Mark has done an excellent job as Hulk especially with some of his interactions with other super heroes. I wish Hawk Eyes character would have been given better treatment. He was lost in the crowd of super heroes. All greats ensemble to form this wonderful movie. Go watch and enjoy all the super heroes of America!!!!",10,5,11,15 May 2012
Bhaag Milkha Bhaag," Brilliant Acting and Direction
",Bhaag Milkha Bhaag has got a long way to go in the history of Indian Cinema. There are not many movies made on real heroes and Milkha Singh is one of our real national hero. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is a real tribute to Flying Sikh of India. Right from the first frame till the last frame I as a viewer thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I am not a big fan of Farhan's acting but he has absolutely done wonders to this role. The kind of preparations he has done can be seen in every frame in which he was present. After Rang De Basanti Rakyesh Om Prakash Mehra has struck another gold and this time it is going to be remembered for a long long time. Sir Milkha Singh has said it correctly that Bhaag Milkha Bhaag has made him immortal. Must watch !!!!,9,4,6,13 July 2013
