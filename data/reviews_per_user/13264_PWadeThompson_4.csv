Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lives up to the Name Star Wars
","The Phantom Menace was a great film and well worth the hype.  Jar-Jar is not as bad as most people seem to think.  Natalie Portman was incredible as the Queen.  Ewan McGregor was a perfect young Obi-Wan.  I've seen it 'only' seven times, and plan on seeing it 3 more, at least.",7,0,0,27 July 1999
Fight Club," worst movie
","I wasted $6.50 tonight seeing Fight Club.  I plan on returning to the theatre tomorrow and requesting a refund from the manager because I do not want my dollars supporting such a movie.  I would call it a film, but it does not deserve such an honor.  The best way I can describe this movie is to say that I came away from it feeling visually and mentally raped.  It was thoroughly violent, but violence is not what offended me most.  The violence for violence' sake offended me.  The pointlessness of the movie offended me. The 'God hates you' dialogue offended me.  I was glad to see that 2 other people had already agreed with me and given the movie a rating of 1.  Do not waste your money on this movie.  Do not waste your time on this movie.  Brad Pitt fans - resist the urge to see this attack on your self-worth and intelligence. I could go on, but you get the picture.  Fight Club - Stay Away.",1,13,42,17 October 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Oh My!
","After waiting outside the theatre (on a gracefully dry day, thankfully) for 8 hours, I must say, I was not disappointed in the least.  I don't know that I can say much without giving any spoilers, but I will say that fans of the classic trilogy will squeal with delight at many moments throughout the film.  C-3PO is back in all his wit, or is that witlessness?  One of my few critiques would be that at a particularly somber moment, 3PO chimed in with a bit of humor that was great but mis-timed.  Many lines oozed with doom knowing what is to come.  Since this was demonstrated in the trailer, I don't think it's a spoiler, but read cautiously - at first, when I heard how Anakin whines in the trailer, I was frustrated, 'That's just like Luke,' I thought.  Then a smile came on my face and I said, 'That's just like Luke!' We totally see how sweet and innocent looking Anakin could become the penultimate definition of evil through the course of this film.  There are so many other points I could talk about, but you'll just have to see it for yourself.  I am, again, tonight!",9,0,0,16 May 2002
The Sixth Sense," Wow!
","Haley Joel Osment is an incredibly talented young actor.  He acts with his eyes.  He helped Bruce Willis pull out some of his best acting.  What a great film.  Great concept.  Great plot.  Great acting.  Great twists.  I could go on, but I don't want to give anything away.  See it.",9,0,0,10 August 1999
