Miracle," Same Story As The Last Movie, But Different
","In comparison of the last movie made on the 1980 Gold Medal USA Hockey Team, 'Miracle On Ice', the story is the same as the 1981 movie, but the story on how they got to where they did was a little different.In the 1981 version, Karl Malden played Herb Brooks.  Karl Malden's version was more standoffish, vicious mentally, played plenty of mind games with his players and used Captain Mike Eruzione as the team's 'whipping boy'.
This version, Kurt Russell was just as demanding and could be just as vicious, but compared to Karl Malden, he was a kinder, gentler Herb Brooks.That's not to say in any way, this was a bad movie.  I throughly enjoyed it. The storyline was good and the action was wonderful.  You felt like you were there and enjoyed seeing the old clips of Al Michaels and Ken Dryden calling the game.  I liked that they used the old footage and not actors playing them.  No one else could imitate Al Michael's saying, 'Do You Believe In Miracles????  YES!!!!!' when Team USA beat the Soviets.In addition, I liked how they incorporated the current events from the gas crisis, the US Embassy in Tehran, Iran taken over by the students, the Soviets invading Afghanistan and President Jimmy Carter's announcement of boycotting the Moscow Olympics, which followed the Placid Winter Olympics about 5 months later.  I remember all of those events and I liked the fact that it wasn't just a hockey movie, but a movie about the USA Hockey Team and the time it took place, since those events potentially affected the team.At the end of the movie, I really liked the 2 tributes they did for Herb Brooks.  The saying in one of the tributes was a beauty.On a personal note, I liked the players they used for the hockey scenes.  I recognized nearly all the players in the cast as almost all of them are former Western Hockey League players and seeing a couple of former WHL/National Hockey League players in Ryan Walter as the referee in the USA/USSR game and Bill Ranford as Eddie Cahill's (Jim Craig) double.I can't wait for the DVD to come out.",Null,0,0,26 February 2004
That Thing You Do!," Enjoyable Movie
","This was a very enjoyable movie that I can watch over and over again.Tom Hanks did a wonderful job writing and directing this movie.  I liked how he cast a bunch of unknown and semi-star actors at the time, with the exception of Liv Tyler and Chris Isaak.  Obviously, he made some good choices as most have moved on to bigger and better things.This was a wonderful story of a local 'garage band' go from being unknown and rise to the top.  I liked how you heard 'That Thing You Do' evolve from a slow ballad, to a raw song with lots of potential, to the smash hit rock song that it became.  Another thing I liked was, there wasn't a lot of 'name dropping' in the movie, in terms of other bands, artists, etc, with the exception of Virgil 'Gus' Grissolm and Gina Lollobrigda.  It would've been easy to do so, but it wasn't done and the writing was good in the sense that they seemed believable.A few bits of trivia from this movie:  Some things you already know and some maybe you don't.-The bass player (Ethan Embry) was never given a name.  In the movie, he's referred as 'the bass player' and in the end credits his name is T.B. Player.-Tom Hanks' wife and 2 of his kids appear in this movie.  Rita Wilson played Marguerite, the cocktail waitress in the jazz club, his son Colin was the page who escorted Liv Tyler when the Wonders appeared on the Hollywood Showcase and his daughter Elizabeth was the bored girl in the dress shop. 
-Is it a coincedence that 2 of the main characters in this movie, Lenny Haise and Jimmy Mattingly, had the same last names as Fred Haise and Ken Mattingly from Tom Hanks' previous movie 'Apollo 13'?-The record label in this movie, 'Play Tone' records and the logo is the name of Tom Hanks' production company.",8,0,0,9 September 2003
10 Things I Hate About You," Not Just Another Typical Teen Movie
","I was very impressed with this movie, as it wasn't just another typical teen movie.  The difference was, this was an entertaining and someone over 18 could watch this and enjoy it.  The cast was good;  I liked Julia Stiles as Kat and George Miller as the over-paranoid and over-protective father, Walter Stratford.  Miller was funny as Kat's and Bianca's father.  He's a very versatile comedic actor.  Any character he's played is funny and not extremely overdone.The thing I found very funny (only people living around the Seattle/Tacoma area would know this), was the high school used in this movie is in Tacoma and almost everything else was shot in the greater Seattle area, which is about a 45 minutes or so drive away.",Null,0,0,20 February 2004
Remember the Titans," One Of The Year's Best
","In a year of many bad movies (USA Today reported the year 2000 was one of the worst year for movies in 75 years), this was one of the year's best.This movie received very little hype and fanfare compared to many box office 'turkeys' of that year did. It seems as though Disney did not have very high expectations for this movie, considering the little promoting they did and release date they gave it. This was grossly underrated.Denzel Washington was excellent as Coach Herman Boone. A highly qualified coach who is tough, but fair to his players. He has faced racism and discrimination throughout his life, is given the head coaching job at T.C. Williams high in Virginia, because of his race.Will Patton as was wonderful as Coach Bill Yoast. Another highly qualified coach who will experience what Coach Boone has, as the head coaching job is taken away from him and takes a demotion as Assistant Coach to Boone, after the white players said they would sit out the season in out of loyalty to Coach Yoast, but mainly, due to their prejudice to Coach Boone.the rest of the cast was good as well. Ryan Hurst as Gerry Bertier, Ryan Gosling as Alan Bosley, had to overcome their prejudices and fears towards their African-American teammates and coach, while Wood Harrris as Julius Campbell, and Donald Faison as Petey to name a couple, will have to deal with their teammates' prejudices I mentioned and come together with their white teammates to become a team. The cast was wonderful. I could go on and on about it, but it there's more to this movie than the cast.Director Boaz Yakin seemed to capture the turbulent times of this era; The post Civil Rights Movement, integration of the public schools in the south and racism in particular. I almost felt like I was there, having to deal with this. I liked the football scenes as well. Once again, I almost felt like I was there cheering on the Titans as they were going for the perfect season and their battle for the Virginia AAA state football title.When I first saw this movie in the theater, I was taken in immediately and I said to myself I will add this DVD to my library. Needless to say, I have it.Another interesting thing is, when this movie is shown on television, I'll watch it. Normally, I won't watch it because these movies have scenes edited out, parts of the dialog is bleeped or dubbed, due to the inappropriate scene, time and/or language content. In addition, you have to deal with those annoying commercial breaks.The reason why I'll watch it is, the scenes that ended up on the editing floor for whatever reason on the theater and DVD version. On the latter. you can find it in the deleted scenes section on the bonus features of the DVD, but on the television version, those same deleted scenes, you can find them back in the movie. On a particular note, you can see Lucinda Jenney's only scene in the movie as Coach Yoast's ex-wife, Arleen Yoast, when she gave custody to their daughter Sheryl to him. Another scene is where Julius and Gerry are at a barbecue and they are discussing their futures. Julius says he wants to go to Ohio State and play for then coach Woody Hayes. This is interesting, because I don't recall seeing that scene when I saw it in the theater and you will not find it on the DVD version of the movie or in the deleted scenes section.Besides being one of the year's best films, this is also one of the best sports movies ever made.",10,1,2,22 May 2005
Liar Liar," Outrageously Funny
","Jim Carrey was outrageously funny in the role of Fletcher Reede; An overworked lawyer who tells one lie after another and on his son Max's 5th birthday, he wishes his dad can go through one day without telling a lie.I thought Jim Carrey was perfect in the role as he does his usual zany acts as he tries to tell a lie, but can only tell the truth. I've always been amazed at the things he can do with his face as well as his hyperactivity. In addition, the things he will do to himself in the bathroom scene in the courthouse as I found out no sound effects were used in that scene where he's actually slamming his head and body into walls, the radiator heater as ell as the toilet seat.If there are any drawbacks, Jim Carrey tends to overact a bit, but he's someone who can do it and get away with it.Jennifer TIlly's character, Samantha Cole, Fletcher's client was good, but this was different to me as she plays an evil person who wants to take her ex-husband to 'the cleaners' in the divorce. I best remember her as Vicki in 'Let it Ride'.At the end, when the credits are rolled, various outtakes are shown and they are worth watching, as he's up to his usual craziness and even a prank is pulled on him. After this movie was released; In some ways, this became the end of Jim Carrey as we know him (ie: Ace Ventura, Lloyd Christmas and The Cable Guy)as he started to take on different types of roles.This is a movie worth adding to your DVD library.",Null,0,0,24 July 2005
Major League," Couldn't Stop Laughing
","I saw this movie when it was released back in 1989 and I couldn't stop laughing;  This movie was hilarious.  It was very fitting, since the Cleveland Indians at the time were the laughingsock of the Major Leagues and for years, they were stuck in the realms of mediocrity or in last place year after year.The cast was great; Led by Tom Berringer, and Margaret Whitton.  She played the perfect villain in this movie.  You just wanted to hate her.  Charlie Sheen, Corbin Bersen, along with 3 unknown actors at the time, Wesley Snipes, Dennis Haysbert and Rene Russo.  Snipes was hilarious as Willie 'Mays' Hayes as well as Haysbert as Pedro Cerrano, the power hitter who practices voodoo.  The cast was well rounded off with Checie Ross as Eddie Harris, the aging religious pitcher, James Gammon, Charles Cypers and Bob Uecker as 'Harry Doyle'.There were many great one liners and hilarious scenes.  The American Express commercial was classic and here's a couple of my favorite scenes:-Jake Taylor, Willie 'Mays' Hayes and Ricky Vaughn are in a bar after a game and discussing the long ball Vaughn gave up:Taylor:  'It wasn't that bad' Vaughn: 'Oh yeah?  Name one park that ball couldn't have left' Taylor: 'Yellowstone' (All 3 laughing)That scene was in the theater version and I've seen it in the trailers for the movie, but it was deleted in the video version.  I'd like to know why, because that was one of my favorite scenes.-'Oh now you come around; But he isn't fooled'- Eddie Harris on seeing Pedro Cerrano crossing himself.Here's a few bits of trivia on the movie:-Funny thing was seeing Pete Vukovich as Klu Haywood, a first baseman. Mainly because he was a pitcher in the Major Leagues.-Catcher Jake Taylor wore #7.  This was the uniform number of longtime Los Angeles Dodger catcher Steve Yeager, who was the technical advisor to this movie and played 3rd Base Coach, 'Duke Temple' (Fitting that Taylor wore his number?).-The movie was filmed in Milwaukee and 3 people affiliated with the Brewers were featured:  Pete Vukovich, Bob Uecker (Brewers play-by -play man) and pitcher Jerry Augustine (Duke Simms).-Was it a coincedence that Miller and Lite Beer was used, since Bob Uecker at the time was spokesman for the Miller Brewing Company?
This movie is one of the best sports movies around.  Getting the dvd is worth it.",Null,37,42,6 February 2004
