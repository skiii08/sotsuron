Hereditary," Simply the worst film EVER
",A complete waste of just over 2 hours of my life. Tediously slow. Not in any way scary. Funny (as in pathetically so) when it's surely not meant to be? I felt robbed. Watch the trailer as that's as much as you need to see. The rest of the film is boring in-fill. DO NOT BOTHER.,1,6,13,18 June 2018
