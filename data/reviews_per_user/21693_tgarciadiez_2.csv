","Another home run for each of these actors and the director. The movie's plot is about two childhood friends who happen to come across each other at a funeral. Little did David Packouz (Teller), a shy penny-earning massage therapist, know that this reunion with his 'old school bro' would take to an extreme turnaround in his life. Efraim Divoreli (Hill) is presented to us as the fun, unconcerned, know-it-all and living the 'life' type of guy. Though roles do seem to flip as the flick goes on. We get a taste of how our ambition and desire of always wanting more and more can sometimes strike back. These two young men, after just hitting a few bowls and some small business affairs in Efraim's office, turn into the up-and-coming hotshots in the Arms Trade. Eventually expanding their business, AEY, and becoming a 'big deal' but run into problems as greed starts to kick in, testing how far they are really willing to go so that they can get their hands on that long-desired prize. It's not all fun and games when your in the big leagues. The film is funny, dramatic and has a Wolf of Wall Street vibe to it. The acting by these two gentlemen, especially Hill is superb. Just can't help not to laugh with this guy. Teller did an awesome job fitting the smart and sensible role, giving us the counterpart. Music throughout the movie was very good and fit in great. Give it a watch, it's worth your while.",Null,0,2,8 November 2016
Her," Overall Opinion
","This movie truly lives up to its 8.4 rating and I find myself giving it yet a better score. The film itself opens up a whole new world of thoughts and possible situations that we as humans could see happening in a not-so-far future. Everything from the soundtracks, to the way it was filmed, camera angles and actors were excellent.I think that Spike really engaged a very interesting and captive way of luring in the viewer and got Joaquin at his very best. At moments you may find yourself dazzled and confused but still extremely caught on to the film,wanting to keep watching and seeing how this awkward yet quintessential love story finishes...",9,0,1,10 February 2014
