Requiem for a Dream," You need to set aside some time for this one.
","I don't know where to begin.  This movie is very disturbing.  These four people loose everything in such a horroific end.  This movie does not glorify anything.  It didn't even make the medical industry look good.  The visual effects and cinematography were pretty good.  I look at those as a bonus, but this by far does not carry the film.  I walked away thinking of this one, in fact the movie is still left an imprint.  It was along the lines of Traffic on how it followed the different characters along.  Traffic is by far worse then this film.  I have not seen a movie of this caliber for awhile.  One thing I must saw, the ones who wrote this film have got some wierd things floating around in there brain.  The more the movie went on the more predictable it became.  The use of forshadowing was basic.  You know how it's going to happen, just not in the way it did.  I think if your looking for crazy drug/reality film then Trainspotting is the way to go.",7,0,1,30 October 2001
