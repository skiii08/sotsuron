Minority Report," Great movie, with holes
","I think this is one of Spielberg's movies where you can definitely see how he benefited from working with Kubrick. With AI the lessons had quite been assimilated by Spielberg, but here they are more integrated.  There are still some typical Spielberg moments (the first chase scene with the jetpacks) but overall he overcomes his need to pander to the audience.I do have a problem with the logic - but I will reserve that for the goofs section.",Null,0,0,17 December 2002
