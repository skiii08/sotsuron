Captain Phillips," Quickly paced; suspenseful
","Captain Phillips is the story of the hijacking of the Maersk Alabama in 2009 off the coast of Somalia. The movie is quickly paced until the final act when it seemed to lose its momentum. Don't get me wrong; there was still plenty of suspense in that final act but the pacing slowed dramatically. The small cast feel of things was also lost when the US Navy showed up. No surprise there; that happens when the US Navy shows up.Hanks and the lead Somali pirate(Barkhad Abdi)have a very interesting interaction throughout the film as Abdi sometimes menaces and sometimes protects Hanks.Captain Phillips seems to be in a head-to-head competition with Gravity. In my book, Captain Phillips wins hands down.",8,2,5,20 October 2013
Gravity," Stunning images
","It's hard to write of Gravity without introducing spoilers, but I'll give it a summarized shot.The images are stunning. The local theater is only showing 3D; that may be the only choice. I'm not a glasses fan, but the 3D is done very well. The sets are also very nicely done.There are a lot of places where it is quite difficult to suspend disbelief on some of the technical points. Gravity is not accurate in the physics sense (from what I read) and a few other places, but to discuss them is to give away things. Just accept Gravity as a suspenseful movie chock full of memorable images.",7,2,5,13 October 2013
Shutter Island," Masterfully done
","Shutter Island is visually rich and very atmospheric in its opening scenes. An approaching hurricane with non-stop rain and wind give a claustrophobic sense of foreboding to the first third of the film.The filmmakers make liberal use of flashbacks to tell the story set at the insane asylum on Shutter Island. We see interleafs of torrential rain and driving snow as the detective played by DiCaptrio switches between the present and a past experience at the Dachau death camp. The mixing of his experiences at Dachau and Shutter Island are perfected by special effects images.Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Willaims, and Max von Sydow add to DiCaprio's impressive performance.The tone of the movie changes significantly near the midpoint. Don't leave to get popcorn then or you'll be wondering what's going on. In fact, you'll wonder that even if you stay. The film keeps you guessing until the very end.",8,2,5,16 September 2013
Life of Pi," Stunning!
","Life of Pi is stunning, beautiful, and philosophical with a tantalizing lack of absolute resolution. The movie is a visual masterpiece. I gasped at many of the images contained within it. (See it on a big screen.) I know the Pi contains a mix of digital artistry and live action, but, for the life of me, I could not see the seams between them.The only problem I had with the film was that I had difficulty understanding the accented English at times. This decreased as the story progresses and I grew more accustomed to the Indian cadence. Speaking of India, Life of Pi gives a vision of an India that I had never pictured.What I believed would be the ending of a bittersweet story was turned on end by a late twist artfully introduced to remove any hint of contrivance. It was impossible to have dry eyes by the end of Life of Pi, and the last few minutes of the film will have me thinking about it for months or years or maybe the rest of my life.This movie has my vote for best picture of the year as well as a half-dozen other awards.",10,9,17,23 November 2012
Man of Steel," Mixed feelings
","I had decided from the box office that MOS was a flop and was going to wait for the DVD release. But when I had to have time away from the house after the death of my magnificent old dog, I decided to see it. It was better than I thought it would be, but it had problems.There were plot inconsistencies and contrivances that had me wondering, 'Why would they do that?' There were times when disasters came rushing at characters...and rushing...and rushing while the characters seemed content to stand and wait in order to add high drama to the scene. It was easy to overlook or discount most of the inconsistencies, contrivances, and melodrama during the movie. They started to whisper at me a bit later. The movie's plot was overall good and I didn't sweat the small stuff. It was a bit too long at around 140 minutes. The script could have benefited from another fine polishing, I think.Think back to the performances, I realized that most of them seemed very superficial. Like the actors were phoning it in. Notable exception were Cavill as Kal, Shannon as Zod, and Traue as Faora. Don't get me wrong; the other performances weren't bad, they just didn't engage me. Like I said, they seemed superficial.There are lots of special effects in MOS. Some were much better than others. The problematic ones were falling buildings that seemed to ignore the rate of acceleration and fall at their own stately pace. The tornado that appeared was massive and very s-l-o-w when such a tornado is usually unforgivingly fast.MOS is worth your time, but it probably won't top your list of favorite movies. Use the viewing as a way to get out of the heat with a friend or loved one. It fits that purpose very well.",7,0,0,20 July 2013
He Got Game," An ethical story superbly filmed and written
","He Got Game is a very enjoyable film. The cinematography is top drawer and the dialog crisply written. The movie explores the moral conflicts surrounding a prospective college basketball player. As soon as various interests decided that he is worth something to them, they pull all the stops on recruiting him to their school. Ray Allen plays the college prospect, Jesus, and Denzel Washington plays his convict father Jay. Ray and Jake are estranged after Jake accidentally kills his wife and Jesus's mother in a moment of passion. Now Jake must balance a release from prison against doing what is best for his Jay. Milla Jovavich and Rosario Dawson add to the fine cast.Many may shy away because it is a Spike Lee film, but the movie isn't a sermon about race relations. It is about a young man being treated as a commodity by family, friends, and strangers. It is worth your time.",7,0,1,22 August 2013
We're the Millers," Better than I thought; a disturbing undertone
","The trailers looked good. Early buzz about the movie said it was disappointing. I relied on the buzz because I'm not a huge Sudeikis fan and Aniston has been hit and miss in her projects.The film had its funny moments and some colorful characters. The movie shows that the world of drug dealing and smuggling is a dangerous world, but then turned that into a long gag. Yeah, it's a comedy, but the attitude that Sudeikis displayed was that yeah, bad things are happening and some people were probably killed, but I'm a hip little dealer who is cooler than everyone else. That recurring attitude just added a little stink to what was an enjoyable movie. Aniston was okay, but the character was pretty clich√©. Standouts were William Pouter(funny, funny), Matthew Willig as One-Eye, Emma Roberts, and Molly Quinn. Laura-Leigh was quite funny in a short role as a moral-less stripper.The closing shot had me wondering if the 'Millers' epiphany was vaporous. The whole ending was a bit trite.",6,0,1,22 September 2013
Django Unchained," Over-hyped; Tarantino excess
","Reservoir Dogs was a pretty conventional buddies-in-crime movie that became noteworthy for its level of violence. Tarantino got himself under control for his sophomore movie, Pulp Fiction--one of my favorites. Pulp Fiction was violent, no doubt, but it was held together by well-developed, interesting characters and dialog. With the exception of the pawn shop crew, you had some level of empathy for all the major characters.Tarantino became much admired after these two movies and seems to have become lazy and dependent on shocking viewers. He reminds me of the creature in John Carpenter's The Thing. He watches other works and stores snippets away until he can assemble them into something different yet reminiscent of the other works. The extended conversations involving DiCaprio and Waltz kept bringing to mind the plantation scene from Apocalypse Now Redux. Waltz's accent and quite a few references to the German language kept me thinking about Inglourious Basterds. Couple the accents with the lack of emotion as Waltz pursues his bounties, and I was thinking Schindler's List. Long panoramic shots with soaring swells of music brings to mind every spaghetti western. Put all these snippets together and you have a contemporary Tarantino movie. Django lacked smoothness; it seemed a choppy agglomeration of...snippets.Django is full of anachronisms. The count on this site is 22 plus three factual errors. Though many people rely on Hollywood to school them in history, I don't expect non-historical, fictional films to be 100% accurate, but it seems like Tarantino had a complete disregard for accuracy. Was this laziness by Tarantino or a deliberate disregard for accuracy in favor of being cool? The characters in Django were one-dimensional. Waltz's dentist was mysterious as to his back story and motivations, and Jackson's Stephen was interesting for his devotion and dismissive behavior toward his 'owner.' (No person can own another, but very often damn sure act like it.) In fact, Stephen's dismissive attitude was unbelievable given DiCaprio's Candies' general intolerance. I think that the attitude was allowed/incorporated to protect the Samuel L. Jackson image as an eternal bad-ass. Everyone else was explicitly good or evil. No shades of grey here. And speaking of shades of grey, there seemed to be a lot of images of women being dominated, whipped, and bound. Shades of misogyny? Rumor has it that $10 million of the $100 million budget was spent on prop blood and fire hoses from which to shoot it. More stylized Hollywood violence for the motive of revenge. Any wonder that people think that the way to right every wrong is obliterate someone? The violence level in Django compared to the general level of movie violence is the difference between pornography and erotica. Perhaps Tarantino's Thing incorporates a snippet from This is Spinal Tap by putting an 11 on his violence amp. Make that a 12. Okay, let's assume that killing three dozen people in a scene is necessary to tell the story. Do we also have to see geysers of blood with every shot? Too much of anything is desensitizing and dilutive.The cast did a good job with their shallow characters. Waltz and DiCaprio stood out from the rest. Foxx, strangely enough, seemed to blend into the background in scenes involving Waltz and DiCaprio. Washington seemed to be a prop, a token as the boys played 'no, **** you.' You probably won't hate Django, but you likely won't be very satisfied unless you drank the Tarantino Kool-Aid. I'd love to see something from him again that is the caliber of Pulp Fiction.",6,4,7,31 August 2013
Elysium," Not Sci-Fi; Political Caricature
","I read reviews that claimed Elysium was thought provoking. It did generate a lot of questions, one of which was what the Afrikaaners with their grossly thick accents were saying. Yes, Afrikaaners. I haven't seen this many villainous Apartheid goons since Lethal Weapon 2. The villains aren't explicitly identified as being from any country because countries have been replaced by classes, but the accents of Delacort and the band of murderous mercenaries sound Afrikanner to me. Elysium is presided over by an Indian, inhabited by Caucasions, protected by white supremacists who seem to be Africa's sole representation. That leave Hispanics back on Earth. The Earth-side scenes are set in a futuristic Los Angeles that looks a lot like a Mexico City slum. The only Anglos in sight are the evil industrialist and his taskmasters...and Matt Damon. With characters painted with such a broad brush, why wasn't the protagonist' part filled by a Latino? The re-emergence of Afrikaaners as villains puzzled me until I realized that the director/writer is South African. I guess everyone has his favorite group of villains. Blomkamp's villains also include the wealthy. His heavy-handed portrayals of rich Caucasions turns everyone in this film into a caricature. I'm reminded of Rand's We the Living where rich capitalists not only oppress the people, they run over someone's puppy too. The heavy-handed absence of subtlety is typical of philosophical works. I guess that makes Elysium more of a philosophical statement than science fiction. This is a criticism of Rand's seminal work Atlas Shrugged, and it holds true for more leftward leaning dogma too. Everything is good or bad. People are evil rich or sanctified poor. The rich seem to have the resources to cast crumbs to the poor, but they won't because don't want to. The film makers turned Elysium is liberal tripe, even throwing in a quick anti-gun remark just before using those guns to fight back against their tyrannical yoke.The special effects are okay. Elysium is probably the least impressive of images. The mercs airship is probably the most impressive effect but even it is nothing special.It's hard to judge the actors' performances because of their comic strip dialog, but Sharlto Copley makes a damned good villain. His only fault really was his heavy accent made it difficult to understand him at times. His character even had a bit of depth in contrast to the one-dimensional nature of the rest of the cast.Elysium makes a so-so way to spend an afternoon...if you don't mind being slapped around for having money enough to buy a ticket, popcorn, and soda.",5,20,32,19 August 2013
The Artist," A breath of fresh air
","My first 10 rating. The Artist is wonderfully refreshing. The black-and-white presentation takes you to a past time but the movie retains a vivacity that is lost with the films of the silent film era. Know what I mean? Watching a silent film from back in the day is always like watching home movies of your dead relatives. Not so with The Artist. It is very much alive, thanks to the standout work of Dujardin, Bejo, Cromwell, Goodman, and Uggie. Bejo especially adds infectious vitality to her role. Dujardin is also quite likable. Cromwell is a sentimental and loyal manservant. Goodman uses his talent at facial expressions to great effect. Uggie? Who wouldn't want a dog like him? He is a role model for canines everywhere. This film is unique. Imitators will likely fail,but The Artist is a winner.",10,3,6,30 August 2013
Jack Reacher," Tightly crafted
","Don't believe the general tone of critics toward this movie. It is a tightly crafted, suspenseful movie that will hold your interest throughout.No, Cruise isn't the six-and-a-half foot tall, hypo-pigmented Reacher of the book series, but he is a believable protagonist. To be honest, my vision of Reacher when reading Lee's books is closer to Cruise than Lee's description. Cruise is pushing the age limit for a believable Reacher, but he doesn't step over it, looking a very fit fifty. His portrayal of Reacher is actually a bit more palatable than the cocksure (and arguably obnoxious) Reacher of the books.There is rapport between Cruise and defense attorney Rosamund Pike. A sexual tension was building between the two but it disappeared about two-thirds into the movie.The set of villains in the movie is genuinely menacing. My skin crawled as they went about their dastardlyishness. Robert Duvall makes a brief but important appearance as a retired Marine.Jack Reacher is a violent film. Don't you dare take your kids to see it. There is a cringe producing sniper scene at the beginning of the film and a bevy of bone-breaking fight scenes, a car chase, and a climactic gunfight. I was struck by the use of what looked like an M-14 rifle in several scenes. I think this rifle was retired from standard issue for the military in general and especially for snipers forty years ago. This isn't a major point but struck me as odd.Jack Reacher is a good popcorn movie. It never fails to deliver action and has a pretty unpredictable mystery in the plot. I wouldn't mind seeing this as a cinematic series.",8,4,12,23 December 2012
Zero Dark Thirty," A bit long but very well done
","Maintain suspense when everyone knows what happened. That was Bigelow's job. She did this, I think, by concentrating on the intelligence chase that led to the location of Bin Laden. The actual shooting of Bin Laden (not a spoiler unless you've been living in a cave) was almost anticlimactic. Thank you, Bigelow, for not doing it in multiple angles in slow motion. Gimmicks would have detracted from the film. The real suspense was also in the chase, and more than a few people died in gathering the intelligence. The torture scenes are brutal. There is little gore but plenty of violence. Bigelow does a good job of making the raid suspenseful despite us knowing the ending. The middle of the film seemed to drag a bit though the beginning and end moved along nicely. The movie crew built stealth helicopters from scratch based on conjecture. They looked very plausible. The DVD has an extra feature called 'Geared Up' that is quite interesting.The cast was top notch. Chastain took on her role completely. She becomes a portrait of obsession, singularly dedicated to getting Bin Laden. Jason Clarke is also a stand-out as Chastain's fellow spook. Joel Edgerton ('The Thing' prequel--yay) leads the Seal Team that ended the long quest for payback.",8,1,3,2 September 2013
The Conjuring," Creepy
","The Conjuring has non-stop, genuinely creepy moments. My skin was crawling regularly during this movie. Twenty minutes into it, I was wondering if seeing the movie at night was a mistake. Yes, it was that creepy. Add to that, the fact that the movie is based on a a true story. The Conjuring was reminiscent of The Amityville Horror (the 70s version)only scarier.The movie is set in 1971. The wardrobe and autos were true to the period and elicited fond memories of the time and a chuckle or two (the plaid, double-knit tie). The adult cast all did admirable work and the five daughters were adorable.The movie has little gore but excels in low-key creepiness. Don't take the kids unless you want to be up all night with traumatized kiddos.",8,0,1,31 July 2013
The Wolverine," Mixed bag
","The Wolverine was quite good until the final act. In that final act, it took on the characteristics of a Roger Moore variety Bond film. After a very suspenseful build-up, the climax got a little silly. Despite the silliness, the movie wasn't destroyed, just diminished.Advice to people who haven't been following X Men or Wolverine, familiarize yourself through some internet searching with the Wolverine's back story. It will help you figure things out in the movie's flashback scenes.Speaking of flashes, the atomic explosion (I won't say when or where) was a little underwhelming. It looked more like a hydrocarbon explosion that a nuclear pop. Its effects seemed muted and slow motion also.There was a dandy battle on top of a bullet train. Very exciting and well done. There were a lot of fight sequences that were well choreographed.The cast was good at their jobs. The dialog seemed muffled, but that may have been the theater in which I saw it.",6,1,3,22 September 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Dark and melancholic
","This is the darkest of this trilogy. There was, to me, also a sense of melancholia and hopelessness to the movie. These emotions are the byproduct of a very high level of violence within the movie. Fifteen minutes into the movie, a group of helpless people are machine-gunned. The movie contains at least two other scenes where men armed with automatic weapons break into crowded public places and begin firing. I'm neither a pacifist nor a stranger to firearms, but these scenes were hard to take without wincing and wondering if another limit was being erased. There is a battle between Bane and Batman that was even worse than the shooting gallery scenes. I looked at my watch to see how much longer remained in the film and wondered if the violence could get worse.I found it difficult to sympathize with any of the characters in Dark Knight. All seemed superficial with the possible exception of Bale's Batman. He did generate sympathy but is a superhero suppose to rely on sympathy? There was another scene in which GCPD's finest face off against Bane's forces. I think the scene was intended to illicit a feeling of retribution, but it didn't. It just seemed like a lot of people dying without benefit. The movie didn't seem to contain much suspense. I felt like I knew what was going to happen for the big buildup/release happened. There weren't many bat gadgets either. The bat flier and bat cycle were used extensively in the movie, but there was a lack of gee whiz for both.I didn't hate the movie but didn't get as much enjoyment from it as I had hoped for. It was as fun as I would imagine nuclear winter to be.",8,1,3,23 July 2012
Signs," A wonderful combination
","The dialog is masterful with well-blended elements of introspection and humor. 'Signs' is in no way a comedy, but there are deeply humorous images and dialog in this film that contribute much to the film without any detraction at all. Laughing out loud is more than a texting tic with 'Signs.' Characters are developed quite well and so deeply that you forget the actors and become engulfed in their characters. The director and his crew create a very believable, dimensioned world. Stories and back stories entwine seamlessly.The photography, lighting,and scoring combined into an atmospheric movie that caught my attention and never let go. The director's movies have been, for me, hit and miss, but 'Signs' is definitely a hit.",9,8,12,18 July 2012
Lucy," Imperfectly Constructed; Perfectly Enjoyable
","Lucy can be picked apart if you wanted to do it. If...then...really? Why would the character do that? Does increased brain power allow someone to do that? The movie is built around the false premise that humans only utilize 10% of their brains.So, don't try to pick the movie apart. Just sit back and enjoy it. Lucy is quickly paced; you won't be bored. Scarlett Johansson is vulnerable at the beginning and engages the viewer as being almost pitiful. She turns into a complete bad-ass as the movie progressives. You end up not pitying her character, just glad that your not standing between her and her goal. Johansson reaches the status of Terminator in this movie.Morgan Freeman's voice and subject matter has you convinced that you're watching 'Through the Wormhole.' Min-Sik Choi makes a good villain, though uncharacteristically inept at times. Amr Waked plays an Interpol(?) cop who is the closest thing to a love interest this movie has for Lucy.There is a good mix of black comedy in with the action and violence. A couple of times, the director made heavy-handed assurances through awkward dialog that Lucy's violence didn't cross a line, pointing out that someone had been shot in the leg and that people were asleep instead of dead. There are more elegant, less obvious ways of pointing out things. If the director wants a violent movie (and Lucy can't be non-violent), then own it.Turn your brain knob to seven and enjoy this summer action flick. Have fun!",8,8,25,27 July 2014
Flight," Great character study
","Flight caught a lot of flak as people realized that it wasn't an action movie about a plane crash. The false impression that it was such a movie undoubtedly came from the movie's trailers. If Flight had been an action movie, it would have undoubtedly been a special effects movie with some character development filling in the gaps between the effects. Flight is really a movie about a pilot's crash that is separate and distinct from the plane's crash.Flight's anti-hero pilot, Whip Whitaker, is played by Denzel Washington. The opening scene of Flight immediately dashes any heroic conception of Whitaker and should scare the daylights out of anyone who flies as a commercial passenger. That scene has Whitaker and flight attendant Katerina Marquez, played by My Name is Earl's Nadine Velazquez, waking up from a night of presumed debauchery and returning themselves to some level of functionality through the use of beer, cocaine, and marijuana.Cut to the airport, where the airliner, piloted by the self-medicated Whitaker leaps from the earth into a severe thunderstorm. Whitaker pushes the aircraft to edge of it performance envelope as he maneuvers the plane through a rough couple of minutes before popping into blue skies. Whittaker turns the controls over to his somewhat priggish co-pilot, Ken Evans, played very well by Brian Geraghty, and treats himself to three bottles of vodka from the drink cart. This scene becomes important later in the movie.The flight progresses and the time for descent begins. Co-pilot Evans pushes the control yoke forward and all hell breaks loose as the plane becomes uncontrollable. Uncontrollable for anyone but Whip Whitaker who takes over the controls and barks a series of orders to Evans and drafts flight attendant, Margaret Thomason, played by Tamara Tunie, into service manipulating the throttles. Whitaker later claims that his actions and instructions came from instinct rather than contemplation. Most movies require that the viewer suspend disbelief to some degree; the instinctual nature of Whitaker's actions and its more or less successful execution requires that suspension. The plane crashes, albeit in a fairly controlled fashion and only six people are lost. Whitaker is hailed by the press and the public as a hero¬Öuntil the routine toxicology test performed on crew members indicates that Whitaker had an impressive blood alcohol content and cocaine in his system. This is where Flight really takes off.The dead demand an answer. So states lawyer Hugh Lang, played by the ever capable Don Cheadle. The movie describes a system where aircraft owners try to blame the aircraft manufacturer or, failing that, pilot error. The manufacturer tries to shift blame to the aircraft owner or crew. Whitaker, as pilot, points the finger at anyone but himself. He says in no uncertain terms that the plane was 'broken.' Enter Nicole, played by British actor Kelly Reilly. Nicole is a down on her luck photographer who became addicted to heroin and prostitutes herself for drug money. Even as the airliner flown by Whittaker flies inverted overhead, Nicole is being wheeled from her apartment after overdosing. The two meet in the hospital later that day. The two become lovers, and Nicole begins a transformation into Whitaker's conscience. Whitaker doesn't enjoy having a conscience, having gone so long without one, and the relationship with Nicole suffers from the strain.John Goodman plays Harling Mays, Whitaker's affable and eccentric dealer and general enabler. Mays arrives at key times in the movie to save the day¬Ö or postpone Whitaker's day of reckoning. The audience should hate what Mays is, but that is hard to do. Director Robert Zemeckis, even has The Rolling Stones' Sympathy for the Devil place each time Mays makes an entrance.The efforts of union representative and Whitaker's old friend, Charlie Anderson, played by Bruce Greenwood, and lawyer Lang give Whitaker the opportunity for denial, something he has done for many years. Will Whitaker run for his life or face the music? Flight is an intense character study that will hold you rapt. Flight is a long movie at 138 minutes, but you won't even notice that.",8,0,3,28 February 2013
Looper," Well done! A new classic.
","I saw Loopers with the expectation that it would be mediocre. It was anything but. Time travel movies are notoriously paradoxical, but Rian Johnson's screenplay was masterfully written and executed the intricate plot nearly without flaw. I say nearly because I am still genuinely puzzled by a couple of points. The confusion may clear up though with more contemplation and viewings. (I plan on seeing this movie at least a dozen times.) And that the movie is novel and fresh enough to require thought beyond the closing credits is a good thing. See with some who you like talking with; you'll love discussing this movie. The cast is superb with standout work from Blunt, Gordon-Levitt, and Willis. And Daniels carries villainy far while Dano's portrayal will make your skin crawl. While on the subject of darker character traits, even Willis and Gordon-Levitt do things that will draw no sympathy from the audience. This complexity adds to the allure of the moview. Loopers is well worth your time.",9,3,9,7 October 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," Suspenseless, tedious, tiring
","I heard good things about 'The Cabin in the Woods' and very much looked forward to watching it. I felt very let down after viewing it. The movies characters were standard slasher movie fare. So much in fact, that thought the film was going be satirical. My idea of satire has an intrinsic thread of humor, but this film had none. The attempts at humor manifested mostly as pot head jokes which have grown shop worn over the past 50 years. There was a complete lack of suspense. When the murderers appeared, my reactions were, 'Okay. Move on.' The movie was very gory. Very. Gory to excess even by slasher movie standards. The premise of the movie was a clever twist, but it fell flat in the assault of splattering gore. 'The Cabin in the Woods' was, for me, a disappointment.",4,2,5,1 October 2012
