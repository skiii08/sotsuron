Walk the Line," amazing
",this film is amazing I've watched it about five times and i cant believe how amazing it is! I'm 15 and i love 50-60s music right now I'm listening to the original Johnny cash and June carter its amazing when i watched the film i went straight out and bought Johnny cash's album and the soundtrack to it. Johnny's single Big river oh my god its amazing u've never heard anything like it! the song by Carl smith and June Carter called 'Times a wasting'' that is the best song ever its so cool! anyway thanks for listening by the way JOHNNY CASH ROCKS (he might even be beta than Elvis) from Leah JOHNNY CASH ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! xxJohnny cash rocks 4eva,10,0,0,20 February 2006
