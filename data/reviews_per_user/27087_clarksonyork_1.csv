Blade Runner 2049," A sequel shortly after 1982: possibly. A sequel in 2017: No.
","As a film made in and by 2017 standards, this was good. As far as sequels go, this film was also good. As a sequel to 1982 Blade Runner, terrible. This galactic disappointment had many flaws, from the badly ripped off Vangelis soundtrack, to the intermittent loud noises to keep the audience awake, incessant nods to the original (need I go on)... On the plus side the basic plot was half decent (however badly delivered in parts) and thankfully a 80 year old Mr R Scott didn't direct and ruin another classic from the outset. I give an extra star for the dog and clever product placements.",3,9,17,30 October 2017
