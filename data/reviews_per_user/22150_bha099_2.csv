It," A scary movie that isn't scary.
","The opening scene is good. From there on...not as much.I guess this movie will please those not familiar with the book much more than those who are. That being said, I don't think it is possible to make a satisfying adaption of 'It' without doing it the Game of Thrones way. More time is needed to dwell on each of the novel's parts to create the feel the book gave us. To tell the story as it was told on paper. So I guess I'll forgive the filmmakers for that.The kids are okay. They've managed to portray the losers and the relationship between them decently enough- considering the running time. Again: more time is needed for better development. Much of what actually happened between the kids and It has been cut, but again - running time. They had to.That they've changed the setting from the 1958 to the 80s was a bad choice, and so are the other changes. They're creating scenes that aren't in the book. They're changing things that are there. The biggest problem I have with the film is the execution of the horror. Constant jump scares, way too much CGI, and a complete lack of understanding of the fact that less is more. Waiting for a scare is the scary part of horror, and this movie just throws everything at you constantly. It just isn't terrifying. At all.I didn't find myself bored, though. Besides the poor performance when it came to being scary, it is an okay movie. It just isn't a good adaptation.",5,494,764,8 September 2017
Signs," Extraordinary suspenseful
","When humans fear darkness and death, the real fear is the unknown. Whatever hides in the shadows is very often scarier than the beast itself. Shyamalan keeps the danger from us. We feel it, but we don't see it. And that is always scarier than constant gore and jump scares.I think Gibson and Phoenix did very well in this movie, their response to this atmosphere is very believable, the execution brilliant. The little girl does well too, the boy is okay.The score may be what impressed me most, it creates dread like nothing else in the movie. Along with the cinematography and the plot, it creates a constant unsettling vibe continuing throughout the entire movie.This is, in short, a brilliant thriller. 9/10.",9,0,3,10 September 2017
