Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A film or a special effects demonstration?
","Now don't get me wrong, I enjoyed watching The Phantom Menace and thought it well worth going to see, but it was clear to me that George Lucas' focus was in the wrong direction. Was it necessary for every single scene to have some kind of CGI enhancement no matter how small? That isn't what made the first ones so good. He was too eager to be visually spectacular (the big fish, even bigger fish bit was decidedly ill-advised). Though the locations were spectacular and fantastic, they were too abundant, detracting from the characters and the story which should have been the focus of the film. Another problem was the apparent determination to fit everyone and everything else in there, the sandpeople didn't need to be there, but they were, pointlessly, just to satisfy the 'trainspotters', the Jedi Mind Trick was slightly overused (although at one point to good comic effect) and in the apparent desire to satisfy the nerdiest of all Star Wars fans, a scientific explanation for the force was given! Surely the whole point of it, why we were so taken with it, was the pure clean mystery about it.I also thought the score had too much brand new music (at least to my ears) that just wasn't good enough, the scores to the old films are absolute all-time classics and that music should have been used more.Other than that, the film is an obvious success, the actors (none of whom could be called a lead, they're all supporting roles) do their jobs well enough, Darth Maul's brief appearance (and it was too brief for my liking) gave us a sword fight Errol Flynn would have dreamed of, and the story was nicely set up for a continuation of Palpatine/Sidious' rise to ultimate power. The pod race, a brilliant rip-off of Ben-Hur's (or is it Spartacus') chariot race was also a fantastic set piece though marred distinctly by the two headed American ESPN commentators.Though I felt slightly disappointed (without particularly high hopes in the first place) I still thoroughly enjoyed the film, but don't consider it to be as good as the original which started the whole thing.",6,0,0,16 July 1999
Casablanca," There may be better films, but this is the one I love.
","Casablanca is the only film I've voted for as a 10 out of 10. I'm not even sure why particularly, as technically there isn't really anything special about it, and if it weren't for a Red Dwarf episode- 'Camille' I probably wouldn't have been interested in watching it. Nevertheless, there's something enduring about it that means no matter how many times you watch it, you're still not sure what the characters really want to do, Rick, Ilsa, and Renault are all 'real' characters, with choices that one wouldn't know how to make. The word 'classic' is ridiculously overused, but it was invented for this film.",10,0,0,22 April 1999
Predator," Arnie's pinnacle
","This is a fantastic action film. In as far as action films can be classics, this is one, because it also makes a decent stab at the suspenseful, power of suggestion, type of thing that made Jaws so great.It's far and away Arnie's best film, and I like most of his others. As far as having aliens in films goes, this is the way to do it, forget Independence Day or any of that stuff.",9,0,0,22 April 1999
Saving Private Ryan," What is the point of this film?
","Some films make you laugh, or cry, or they shock you into thinking,or whatever, this just makes you go urrgh!  Graphic violence to no particular end other than this 'freak out the audience' factor. Nevertheless, it's well made, well acted and is moving, but for some bizarre reason Spielberg is overcome by a massive need for a disgracefully cheesy ending which, quite frankly, does make you look at the rest of the film in a different light.",7,1,2,1 January 1999
