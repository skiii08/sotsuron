Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Incredible
","I just finished seeing The Phantom Menace, and i have to say that all the critics that are saying that it is a disappointment are WRONG.  It is still the great fairy tale story it always was, and if you go in looking for a fun and exciting ride, you will get it.  If you go in for some Academy Award winning movie (why would you?)..you won't be satisfied...BUT...the movie is great, the characters are fun, the effects are incredible and the podrace and lightsaber battle are by far the best Star Wars scenes EVER!  GO SEE THIS MOVIE!",Null,0,0,20 May 1999
The Matrix," One of the greatest sci fi action movies I've seen
","I just got back from seeing 'The Matrix' and I have to say that of all the sci fi action flicks I've seen in my years (including Star Wars and Blade Runner...etc) this beats them all, hands down.  It is literally a breath-taking bomb of special effects and cinematography to watch.  The direction and technical aspects of the film are great, but the movie itself cannot be told unless you have seen it.  The actors/actresses might not be the best ones, but they are great in their roles, and the storyline is almost frighteningly clever.  The Wachowski brothers do a great job of writing and direction.  Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss are really fun to watch, and the movie IS A BLAST!  Go sEE IT!THE sci fi action flick to beat this year!",Null,0,0,10 April 1999
