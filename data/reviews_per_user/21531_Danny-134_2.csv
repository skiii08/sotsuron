The Blair Witch Project," sequel = overkill
","PLEASE, DON'T DO A SEQUEL!!!!Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the first Blair Witch Project even in the midst of the endless hype and the 'scariest movie ever' crap.  I'd still easily pick it as one of the top three most creative movies of 1999 (along with Magnolia and Run Lola Run).  I'm glad that it at least scared the pants off the bloated Hollywood producer-types with their trillion-dollar budgets, BUT...A sequel here would do nothing but prove that young directors can't ever make it big on low-budget masterpieces without running it into the ground first with a souped-up Act Two.  Perhaps I'll eat my words if Blair Witch II is filmed for under 50K, and shows those two hillbilly river fishermen getting eaten alive by the ghost of Heather Donahue.  I doubt it...",7,0,1,29 January 2000
American Beauty," 'Look Closer'??? they said it, not me.
","Wow!  Another Hollywood version of a 'edgy' character drama with 'subtle' humor, 'dark' undertones, and 'artful' directing!  The same sort of Oscars that Titanic 'deserved' in 1997 are definitely going to be piled onto American Beauty in 2000.As hard as I tried to absolutely LOVE this movie (and believe me, it did have a few exceptional moments), I couldn't steer past the second-rate teenage acting and all of the Ice Storm similarities...  Then again, in my opinion Magnolia was by far the best film of the year, a statement that pretty much voids any credibility I could ever hope to establish with the majority of you A.B. fans, right?  oh well...",5,0,0,29 January 2000
