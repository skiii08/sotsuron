The Blair Witch Project," A different kind
","I think the main reason I went to see the Blair Witch Project was because of all the hype it was given. I'll admit that when I actually saw it, I was a little annoyed, because it was nothing like what it had been advertised as (at least for me.). Don't get me wrong, I liked it, and I though it was a wonderful movie. The bits that really annoyed me where when you would be left in darkness for a few minutes as one of the characters fumbled around in the tent looking for something or when the torch ran out. Being left in the dark, even for a few minutes made me get distracted. Overall, I liked it. I didn't come out very scared- I thought that it was the last 15 minutes that really stuck in my mind. And even now, months after I first saw it, I still wonder about it- what is the Blair Witch? Is she real? The shakey camera got to me a bit, but the movie wouldn't have been good without that effect. It's cast was also wonderful and I thought it was well worth seeing.",Null,0,1,7 April 2000
