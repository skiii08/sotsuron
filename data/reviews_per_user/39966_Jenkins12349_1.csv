It," A clown molested by CGI does not a good reboot make.
","Seldom do I feel the need to review a film but for IT I make the exception. After an extreme amount of hype from critics and friends alike I went in somewhat hopeful, alas it appears the bell grade is based on nostalgia in this bleak age of remakes and not merit. The film starts strongly enough ,let's poor one out for poor Georgie. Unfortunately the films somber tone doesn't carry on at least in terms of horror. While pennywise is frightening enough when kept to the shadows it's when he's truly revealed that the dread falls flat, not because of the score or the actor which are both fantastic, but because of the films need to superimpose his movements through CGI, yes the film makers went for a gamble in making his movements less than human, but instead of relying on Bill's obvious talent to do so himself, employed computer graphics instead, which made his appearance somewhat laughable. The films strength lies in its coming of age tale, and in this it truly does thrive, leaving very few of it's core cast to the side line ,though there's always one, oh Stan you whiny bastard, why couldn't you have just died. From bullying, isolation and parental abuse/neglect, the film covers all bases and it does it well. A mash of the two genres which should glue together but in this instance doesn't. It's unfortunate because the possibility for a great film was there. But the reliance of jump scares leaves little to the imagination.",5,0,5,22 September 2017
