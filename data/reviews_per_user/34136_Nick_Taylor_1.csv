Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It could've been worse.
","I just sat down and watched the movie again after viewing the original trilogy, and I have to say, it could've been worse.The story was there, the action was there (although you could still tell they used miniatures on strings) what was clearly missing was the acting, and the sense of novelty. When the original trilogy came out, it was unique. It presented a simple world, with good and evil, and an all-powerful force. And laser swords. Sure, this movie's lightsaber action was good, (especially the end sequence) But the acting was very, very shallow. And even after watching this again, I don't know why Jar-Jar was introduced. And if they had to bring him in, don't make him so dumb.Anyway, I digress. The political background was deep and intense, but the movie almost seem too politics based. One thing I didn't understand was why everyone had different accents. That was strange, and detracts from the overall experience. Anyway, it's definitely worth another watch, if only for the action, or just to watch all the Star Wars movies again.6/10 stars.",4,0,1,11 July 2006
