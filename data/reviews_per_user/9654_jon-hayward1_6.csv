Alien 3," Nice Poster...
","Sorry, I have tried hard to like this movie but I really don't! The only thing that makes me giving it 3 instead of 1 is that the Directors Cut version I have just seen is an awful lot more cohesive in structure and characterization than the one I saw in the cinema - full credit to Paul McGann. The whole behind the scenes struggle to make the film is very apparent in the final film - characters are introduced and dispatched, and do we care? No The sets are beautiful - but what are they for?! The prisoners / monk set up just isn't credible, Charles Dance is wasted (literally!) for what? There are no answers to any of the questions posed by the first two films, no development to the franchise as we knew the company were no gooders in the first one! The only scenes (apart from the restored Golic ones) that meant anything to me were the ones involving Ripley, Bishop the android and the bodies of Newt & Hicks. They were very poignant after all the trials we had been through with the characters in Aliens. The ending didn't help much at the time I first saw it either, as Ripleys big suicide moment came to the screens too close to Arnies trip to the furnice in T2 to be anything approaching original. But of all the criticism I could heap on this unfortunate film, the biggest one in my eyes is that along with killing Hicks and Newt, the writers dismissed Aliens altogether and turned Alien3 into a dismal rehash of Alien. The more I think of it, the more I am inclined to give it 1 out of 10 after all... But the poster and T shirt were great",1,496,542,23 January 2004
Alien: Resurrection," Ryder and Weaver - WOW!
","After the appalling debacle of Alien3 I REALLY wasn't looking forward to this film but in the end I was very pleasantly surprised! The introduction of the smugglers was a welcome departure, and diffusing Ripley to the role of anti-heroine was another stroke of genius. A very visual film which boded well for the future development of the franchise. Whether or not Ryder and Weaver can be enticed back to the world of Aliens is another matter of course",7,2,5,23 January 2004
The Thing," A re-make that works!
","I don't like remakes at all, but the original of this film hasn't aged well and it almost put me off seeing Mr Carpenters version. I'm glad I did as this particular re-make is an extremely taut and exciting film which far out strips the (rather boring) original. As you can expect from Mr Carpenter there is the usual measure of gore but in this instance at least it never feels gratuitus and heightens the tension. The characters work in the film too - sure we know they're going to get picked off one by one, it is a horror film after all, but they appear more than the usual slasher fodder. A good film, very intelligent and probably my favourite John Carpenter film",9,0,1,8 February 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Not impressed
","I HATE sequels that retell the originals storyline with different actors: I HATE sequels that negate their predecessors: Oh Yes, and in case you didn't realise it,  I HATED THIS FILM!There is no point in making this film, the first two were classy and were complete in themselves. I have only seen this once and I never want to see it again (or any other mindless cash ins that might follow whenever the studio gets short of money)
If you want a creepy, action packed, horror/sci-fi crossover which is genuinely unnerving, see The Terminator.If you want a good, high action, rollercosting film with lots of thrills, see T2: Judgement Day.If you want to watch this film, you will be disappointed",1,8,17,30 March 2004
Aliens," The Perfect Sequel
","I don't like sequels: Predator 2 and Highlander 2 are just about as bad as it gets - Aliens is different... Whereas Alien was a brilliantly brooding dark film, almost docu-drama in places, Aliens is a rollercoaster of action but it never looses sight of the characters it creates. You really get to care about all of them a lot - even the soldiers who are on the edge of the action like Dietrich. And Burke has to be the only character in any Aliens film where I've been routing for the extra-terrestrials! There are so many electrifying scenes - but the one that still sends a chill down my spine (on the 100th viewing!) is when the Aliens awake for the first time and catch the marines off-guard. Ripley is at her morose best in this film and the growing relationship with Hicks and Newt  - and Bishop -is another significant departure from the original and which builds the series as a whole to another level  (sad then that Aliens 3 smashed away all of the fine building blocks set up by Cameron) A definate must see film!",10,0,0,23 January 2004
Shrek," The best childrens film for adults you'll ever see!
","Taking children to the cinema can be an arduous experience - try sitting through the S Club film to see what I mean. Shrek is the ultimate exception. This film works fine for kids as young as 4-5 who can recognise the storybook characters and 'simple' storyline, but there is also a wealth of humour that Adults can appreciate on a much more subtle level. I have yet to meet anyone of any age who hasn't found this film extremely funny and I would heartily recommend it to everyone as a 'must see' movie",10,3,4,8 February 2004
