Hereditary," Top 5 of all time
","Hereditary takes a place in my top five horror films of all time. It includes scenes that will stay with me forever, and yet I will rewatch. So skillfully crafted, it builds from nothing to devastating so smoothly that one scarcely notices what is happening until one is witnessing the unthinkable. Casting and acting are absolutely faultless. My compatriot Toni Collette carries so much of the weight of the evil that is manifest in this film that I cannot fault what she brings. This is indeed a Shining, an Exorcist for the 21st century. Love it.",10,3,7,15 September 2018
