The Monuments Men," Raises Good Question - But Very Poor Movie
","Is art worth more than human life is the central question of this movie. Unfortunately, this movie adds nothing to the discussion.The movie was really a comedy and should have been advertised as so instead of as an Action/Drama. Most of the conversation in the movie were one-liners. And poor ones at that. The movie failed to make us care about any of the characters or their mission.It's really a shame. The movie had great potential with such a star studded cast.I wish the movie would have given more of a reason why art is more important than human lives aside from just pretentiousness about how art is 'important'. I think most people in the theater when they saw the art were thinking about the monetary value of the art even more than the humanitarian aspect.",2,13,24,8 February 2014
Captain Phillips," Very Good Fictional Movie
","This movie had me on the edge of my seat for most of the film. The lack of a soundtrack was surprisingly great and made the movie feel more realistic. Also the usage of moving cameras which gave a great feeling like you were there.It's a shame that after reading more about the movie it seems that most of the movie is fake - but that is to be expected in Hollywood I guess. They did a good job of making a gripping movie which felt realistic.I have to say though that up until the hijacking, the acting felt a bit forced. Even Tom Hanks wasn't convincing - especially before they get on the boat. (Maybe this was partially clouded by my knowledge of Tom Hank's other movies.)The parts with the US Navy thought are unbelievable. Message of the movie: Don't mess with Uncle Sam.I highly recommend seeing this movie.",8,0,2,14 October 2013
This Is the End," Mediocre
","There were a few pretty funny scenes - especially the Michael Cera bits - but overall this was not one of their best movies. It felt too long and a bit too ridiculous. Likely worthwhile to see anyways but not a second time.It was a weird movie in that some scenes were somewhat horror-like, the guy sitting next to me screamed at one point - while most of it was pure humor and juvenile comedy. The graphics were very good.Overall, if you like Seth Rogan and the other guys in the movie, you should probably see this movie. Just don't expect that it is going to be a Superbad.",5,26,58,13 June 2013
We're the Millers," One of the Funnier Comedies I've Seen Lately
",When you compare this to other comedies in recent history I would consider this movie very good. The problem is it doesn't really have anything original to it. All the jokes have been done a thousand times in previous movies/television shows. Thankfully most of those bits are still funny. (Most of the jokes were fairly raunchy).I can't say I was a huge fan of any of the actors of the movie from their previous stuff but I thought they were pretty good in the movie.I gave this a 7/10 as a comedy. I would recommend for people to see the this movie. It is much better than This is the end of the internship (the last two comedies I saw in theaters).,7,1,6,17 August 2013
