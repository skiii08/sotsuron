Resident Evil: Afterlife," This zombie movie is up and running
","This movie only got a 19% approval rating on some website I'd like to throw rotten tomatoes at. But of course the aforementioned website only has 'professional' critics writing their reviews. The 'professionals' are usually sitting on one thumbs while pinching their noses with the other hand when it comes to pure action movies like this.I'm not going to waste your time with a long synopsis. If you're a fan of the series or this genre, you already know the basic plot; there's zombies and humans, lots of zombies die, lots of humans die. This movie pretty much picks up where the last one left off.If you're a fan of zombie movies, this is a pretty good one and the best since the original. I'll make this easy for you and break it down into its separate components.Let's get the bad news out of the way. There's no character development, most performances are limited because of this, and the dialog is unimaginative. But, despite all that, who cares, it's a zombie movie.Actors (worth mentioning) Milla Jehovah (Alice) - She's always been very easy on the eyes, still is, and looks great in leather. I think what has kept this series alive is her personality, sex appeal, and stage presence. No, she won't win any Oscars for this performance (the Oscars are BS anyway), but she manages to project all of the previously mentioned qualities just fine. I give her an eight out of ten.Kim Coates (Bennett) - I always like Kim Coates. He's got the sleazy, wormy, bad guy thing down pat. He did well with what he was given, which wasn't much, but he turned in a pretty good performance. You'll enjoy his wormy behavior in this movie and enjoy it when his character gets what's coming to him.Ali Larter (Claire Redfield) - She was scorching hot. She did real well with the physically demanding parts of her role and even better with her performance. I think with a little more training, she could turn into a great female action star. I think she would do well with a Laura Croft role or even (if she dyed her hair) a Supergirl part. I give her an eight also.Wentworth Miller (Chris Redfield) - I never liked this guy, he sucks. Let's move on.Things I liked: 1) The 3D is totally worth the price of admission. The director (Paul W.S. Anderson), the cinematographer, and special effects people really did a nice job of delivering some very nice shots.2) Bam, Bam, Bam, the pace was excellent, it moved right along. People criticize it for little or no character development, but in an action movie, (especially one with a history), is it really necessary? I liked the way it moved along WITHOUT a bunch of meaningless chitchat, the less talking, the more action. Besides, most of the new comers don't last that long to care about anyway.3) Explosions, blood, guts, scream, and shout that's what a zombie movie is all about. What it lacked in tension, it made up with some great action. There were several really great fight scenes, a couple of great explosions, and lots of brains flying every which way.nice.Look, it's a ZOMBIE movie, you know what to expect. I don't understand why all the 'professionals' think Shakespeare should be consulted. I like zombie movies and I thought this was a darn good one. So, mister or misses snob, you don't like zombie movies, up your nose with a rubber hose.go see something else and quit ragging on Jovovich.",8,10,22,18 September 2010
