Hereditary," Cant stop thinking about it
","This movie is a puzzle that you have to put together yourself. Every shot and every sequence has meaning and there is so much to think about after seeing this movie. There are so many powerful shots near the end and just stay with you. Don't expect to just see this movie and move on... you will need to do some thinking, you will need to do some research, and I feel this movie will be talked about for a very long time. There are images that I will probably never be able to get rid of in my head, which is great because I love horror and this is exactly what I could have wanted from a horror movie. Definitely one of the greatest horror films released for some years.",10,71,142,9 June 2018
