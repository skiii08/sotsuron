The Avengers," Stunning....Ly awful
","when i was twelve, i was so excited about the avengers coming together, after seeing ed Norton in the incredible hulk, and then iron man, even captain America 1,( Chris Evans was good in it) i saw it once, and was thinking, THIS IS IT?? I saw it again and thought... WHY?????? the first half has lame jokes, extremely boring fights, and a whole twenty minutes dedicated to Tony fixing a over-sized fan. The second half is even worse, there's no depth in these characters, once you see that the 'push' by Nick Fury was fake, and col son is alive, so the avengers come together over a lie. which aggravated me so much. One of the biggest gripes I have.....WHERE IS ED NORTON???????i mean Mark Ruffalo was OK, but seeing Edward Norton was the most exciting thing about the avengers, and then he's not even in it. And the hulk looks like Arnold Schwarzanegger overdosing on steroids. I can't stress enough how much Hawkeye sucks. He was a pawn for half the movie. His character was dull and boring. And then this movie is hailed as the best Marvel movie ever. WHAT!!!????? Iron man. The incredible Hulk. THE GODDAMN SPIDERMAN MOVIES!!!!!!!!! Marvel is just disappointing left and right. And I love Marvel. the X-men and spider-man movies are the best ones. And then the second avengers was better, but still lacked a lot of the things the first one was missing. Give Marvel to talented directors. GOSH!!!!!!! Christopher Nolan is already with DC, so why not get TALENT like Brad Bird, Matthew Vaughn, DANNY BOYLE, Neil blomkamp. just UGH NO MORE JOSS WHEDDON!!!!!!!this movie just sucks",5,3,8,29 May 2015
Southpaw," Powerhouse Acting. Clich√© story, BUT amazing execution
","I'm probably not the first one to say this, nor the last. JAKE GYLLENHAAL DESERVES AN Oscar!!!!!!! more so than Leo DiCaprio. Gyllenhaal has shown such dedication and commitment to his roles. i mean, a couple months ago he was Lou Bloom. He really makes you feel the pain that he does. When something happens to him, then worse stuff happens, you just think.'It has to get better, maybe it will- NOPE. Nevermind. 'You want him to get his life together, but so many bad things happen that you don't know how he can get better. OK. so let me continue with the acting. Rachel Mcadams, Forest Whitaker, 50 cent, AND Oona Laurence all did great jobs. Everyone has their own emotional response to the crap that happens in the film. They all handle it in their character's own way. Which was great. There should be an Oscar category for Best Cast Ensemble, because everyone in this film did their jobs amazingly. The story is not anything new. You have seen this before, but the execution takes that feeling out. And you leave the theater feeling refreshed with a new take on a great story. THe film has a satisfying story with a great gut punching ending with a great cast ensemble with all around great performances. Jake Gyllenhaal gives an Oscar worthy performance that pulls no punches. Overall i loved this movie. It was a fully functional, well acted, well- executed film. I highly recommend it. Definitely my favorite movie of the summer.",9,0,1,9 September 2015
Steve Jobs," Beautiful. Danny Boyle has done it again.
","I'm going to make this review short, and spoiler free. I hope. Steve Jobs takes place during three different events over the span of I think 19 years. It's a look at the 40 minutes backstage before the unveiling of a product by Jobs. Going into this movie I had no idea what to expect. But I knew that a combination of the genius behind Slumdog Millionaire and Trainspotting with the genius behind The Social Network and A Few Good Men had to be a great match. And it's the greatest collaboration I've ever seen since Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects. It's not anything like that film, but the collaboration of Boyle and Sorkin was as beautiful as what was done with Bryan Singer and Christopher McQuarrie. The direction by Boyle was beautifully done. He is very unorthodox with his directing, and embraced that with this film, and the writing adds so much to the film. The balance of technological mumbo jumbo and emotional breakdowns and arguments brought to life through tremendous acting makes this film one of the best films of 2015. If not, the best. Oh yeah, the acting. Michael Fassbender deserved the Oscar a million times more than Dicaprio. Fassbender's performance was such a layered character, at times I forgot that I was watching an actor, I thought it was a documentary with real footage. Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, Jeff Daniels, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Katherine Waterson all give amazing performances. They all react to Steve Jobs in the most human, and believable character ways that bring a whole other reason for this film to be more deserving than Spotlight. All in all, this film is an amazing, realistic film that shows more of the personal, and emotional affairs of Steve Jobs. If you're expecting a regular biopic highlighting his finest hours, then you won't fully get that. But you'll receive a masterpiece crafted by Danny Boyle. This film was robbed at the Oscars, and is easily one of the best of 2015. Final Rating: 9.8 Rounds up to a 10 so...",10,0,1,18 April 2016
