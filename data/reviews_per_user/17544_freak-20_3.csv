The Blair Witch Project," I'm never camping again
","The Blair Witch Project has done something no other movie has before, utterly scared me.  This is not for everyone.  If you scare easily do not see this movie.  Thinking about some of the scenes sends chills down my spine, especially the final scene.  This is just pure psychological horror and now I can't walk into a room without checking every corner.  I am never going camping or even going near any kind of wooded area again.  I must give the Blair Witch Project kudos for being the most terrifying movie I have ever seen.",10,1,2,18 July 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Very Uncut
","They do mean uncut.  This is not a movie for younger crowds.  I laughed so hard while watching this.  The humor is mostly crude jokes but if you like that then you should enjoy this movie.  The musical numbers were very funny, most of the time I could only hear a few lines because everyone in the theater were laughing.  There are a few way over the top visuals that were probably put in because they could get away with it.  I really enjoyed this movie.",10,0,0,29 June 1999
Tarzan," WOW
","I haven't been this moved by a movie in years, animated or live action. The animation is amazing and the backgrounds take your breath away.  The characters were well done, especially Jane and Tarzan.  The music sets the pace and the mood very well.  The only complaint is that it was too short. I wanted more.",10,1,1,20 June 1999
