Blade Runner 2049," Better than expected
","Visually amazing movie. The story line was not too obvious though some of the characters were. Given that I haven't seen the original Blade Runner and that sci-fi is not my favorite genre, I was positively surprised.",7,2,11,19 February 2018
Call Me by Your Name," Would recommend!
","The cinematography was beautiful and made me feel that I was there: that I could feel the gentle breeze and smell the peach trees. The story proceeded slowly but it was not boring or tedious, but rather full of emotions. For me, the ending was the best and the most beutiful part. I was also astonished by the soundtrack.",9,1,7,19 February 2018
