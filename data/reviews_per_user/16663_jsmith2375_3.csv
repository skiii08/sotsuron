Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Millions of dollars for a script written by a 6 year old
","Am I the only person who watched this movie and wasn't buffaloed by the great special effects.  I am a huge Star Wars fan, but man this movie really sucked.  Sure the scenery, costumes, and special effects were all top notched and they really did give the viewer the feel of the stars wars movie's, but the acting and story are amazingly bad.  I have watched the movie several times, and I still don't understand why the trade federation (a group of chinese toad people) feel the need to invade the peaceful planet of Naboo.  Well they do attack and the princess of Naboo must esacpe with two jedi.  They meet up with some uncharismatic little kid (anakin skywalker, who is like 7 in this movie, and eventually gets Natalie Portman-the princess pregnant with luke and leia, don't pay attention to the fact Natalie Portman is 18 in this movie, they are replacing the actor of anakin in stars wars episode 2 with an older kid, why not have the foresight for this in the first place)  The movie is just plain stupid.  The robots look weak and flimsy, and they stutter.  The spaceships have lost all of the charm and individuality compared to the first three movies.  The end is so anti-climatic.  This trade federation sends in a horde of robot troops to conquer the planet.  The gungans (a native race of naboo) accidentally stumble around and blow up a lot of robots, but the ultimate slap in the face is when the seven year old Anakin, stumbles upon a spaceship, accidently turns in on, unwittingly flys into space and it just so happens that all the robots on the planet (thousands upon thousands) are controlled by one master ship, and little Anakin accidently fires a missile and coincidentally blows up the master ship.  I am actually angry at how bad this movie was because it has jaded such a great set of movies, by adding this with the other great movies, they are all somehow dirtied by it.  I am done ranting, thanks.",1,21,40,7 March 2002
Troy," Please kill me Achilles!
","If you crap into a 200 million dollar box, you still have crap inside! I love historical epics (braveheart, gladiator, and rob Roy), I love epics in general (lord of the rings trilogy), but this movie doesn't even deserve to be ranked with any of these. Its boring, poorly acted (my goodness, Brad Pitt is so bad in this movie its painful), and just bad. Oh, Helen of Troy is only average looking at best, I couldn't imagine her face sinking a thousand ships. Orlando Bloom's character is very gay, his brother Hector (Eric Bana) is a unconvincing war veteran and acted about as good as he did in Hulk (blah!) I bought this movie brand new for 12 dollars and in a year it will be in the five dollar bin at wal-mart, I am willing to bet that this is one of the biggest flops of all time...",2,11,25,21 April 2005
Scary Movie 2," A Gross, Irreverent, but Hilarious Movie
","I can't understand why this movie is getting such a bad rap.  I have a pretty good taste in movies and I thought this movie was a riot.  From the opening scenes where they spoof the excorcist to the end where they spoof hannibal this movie is pure genius. Granted, this movie is a slapstick spoof of horror and modern thrillers, so don't expect a serious movie with a clear cut plot.  But if you are looking to laugh until your liver explodes then rent this comedy!",8,0,1,20 March 2002
