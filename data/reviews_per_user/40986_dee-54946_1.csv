Hereditary," Hated it!
","Well it looks like I am the only one here who absolutely hated this film and found it incredibly boring. I am sure there are a lot of people out there who can give explanations for everything pertaining to the film but to an average joe like myself who lives going to the cinema, his film was just awful and I cannot understand the great reviews. I thought more wldve been made of the deceased grandmother, the deceased daughter, the dolls house etc etc etc and I haven't got to the ending yet which to be honest was one of the worst endings I have ever watched. This film was a real disappointment!",1,9,22,16 June 2018
