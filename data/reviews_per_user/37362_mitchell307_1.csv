Source Code," Tough to overlook the logic holes, though I really tried
","I would never say Source Code is a bad movie, but there are simply way too many gushing reviews - from critics and viewers alike - than this film warrants. That the film is a highly suspenseful thriller cannot be argued. I quite enjoyed the main character's recurring trips inside the source code scenario. The problem is that the central premise of Source Code is implausible at best and quite possibly ludicrous. It's as if the filmmakers felt that if they peel away the layers of plausibility very slowly, the audience won't notice. It does seem like many viewers either didn't notice or didn't mind the holes. I'm willing to entertain the occasional logical stretch, but when it is the film's central premise being stretched beyond recognition, that's when I begin to have a problem. As much as I wanted to go along for the ride, I just couldn't go all the way. By the end, the cumulative effect of all the liberties taken by the filmmakers became enough to bump Source Code from out of the sci-fi genre and into the fantasy world.",6,3,5,9 April 2013
