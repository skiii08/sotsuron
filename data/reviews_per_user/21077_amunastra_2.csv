Casablanca," Unforgettable
","Casablanca is one of the finest movies ever to be screened.There are some incredible performances.Ingred Bergman as Ilsa trapped between two loves.Paul Henreid as Victor Lazlo a Resistance leader fleeing from the Nazis.Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blain always on the side of the underdog and Ilsa old flame.Dooley Wilson as Sam playing some great music.Peter Lorre plays Ugarte a loser who hopes for one big win. Claude Rains as a French policeman whose only concern is himself. Michael Curtiz the Director gets inside the characters he turns them into real people. The film has more than any other film.With the backdrop of the second world war set in free French Casablanca.You have a triangle of love,Action,Intrigue,stirring music and a twist in the tale.You can see Casablanca many times and every time you want watch again.",10,1,4,24 July 2005
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Opinions vary
","Only my opinion but I couldn't get into the film.I like to be engrossed in a film that It takes me into the story.I thought it needed some brightness in the filming.I always like to get to know in depth at least one of the characters but alas I couldn't. I recognised Peter Cushing as soon as I saw him,which gave me a little more interest.Only for the fact that I was racking my brains ,trying to work out how he was resurrected after passing away many years ago.I have ticked the spoiler box for that reason but I wont tell you how it was done or the reason why.I must admit I fell asleep three quarters through the film through boredom and haven't and don't intend to watch it again.",1,4,14,16 May 2017
