Hereditary," Enjoyed it (as one can enjoy a horror movie)
","It starts with a tragedy that draws one into. But not in a hasty way such that I did not expect it.
So first part of the movie is drama, but it builds a foundation for the second part, where its starts to reach the horror-genre.
At that point, they accomplished - using a very common element of horror movies - raising many questions, turning the movie for me to total confusion. I enjoyed the hints the authors give the audience (if you watch it you'll know).
The end answered all questions with a relatively simple answer, but I wasn't disappointed.",9,2,3,27 February 2019
