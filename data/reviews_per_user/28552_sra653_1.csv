Vertigo," I am just a student...
","Of course after watching this movie I gave it a 10 out of 10, but maybe because I am just a student I has difficulties understanding some of the little details through out the whole movie. I need to write a paper on the symbolism in the movie, but it is hard when I am left with so many unanswered questions. For starters what is with the women in the painting? At first she was supposed to be possessing Madeline, but then we find in the end we find she has nothing to do with Madiline. Do I just disregard her completely and her whole story about her or is there more to her then that? Also I had difficulties understanding the symbolism in the colors, what do they mean? The same thing with the flowers, what do they mean. Someone help me...",10,5,6,19 February 2005
