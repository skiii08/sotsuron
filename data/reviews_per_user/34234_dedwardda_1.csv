United 93," United 93 is a film about real people in a real '24' situation. You are there! Even though the outcome cannot change, United 93 holds you in suspense.
","Like many, I thought United 93 was going to be another money rip-off of a 'true' event. I was wrong. It's a beautiful movie. There were no 'black hat' villains...there were no John Wayne heroes...United 93 had people...from different walks of life...with different beliefs...and died following their hearts. Perhaps, with more movies like this, we may come to an understanding why people do what they do all around the world. I was not watching a movie. I was viewing life...from both sides. We all pray to the same God...and we all eventually die. Perhaps, with love and understanding, we all may all one day live together peacefully before we do meet our Maker.",10,1,4,30 April 2006
