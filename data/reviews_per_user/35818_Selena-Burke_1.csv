Marie Antoinette," One of the most beautiful movies I've seen
","I'll be honest. This is one of those movies that you'll either hate, or absolutely love. I don't know many people who are on the fence when it comes to their love/hate for this movie (however, I've never met anyone who didn't love it). From beginning to end it appealed to me, and being a person who doesn't tend to watch a movie more than once (with rare exception) I found myself watching this one over again as soon as the credits began rolling. There is so much eye candy to take in and subtle bits that you don't catch the first time around, that if you love it the first time through, it's worth watching again, and again. I can see why some people wouldn't appreciate this film, as it's a bit eccentric, but not so much as to separate the viewers from the history upon which this film was based. It's fun, quirky, filled with delightful acting and definitely for those who color outside of the lines (I quite appreciate the departure from forcing actors to strap on fake French accents for the sake of making it 'closer to reality' because I'm often times extremely distracted by bad accents). I didn't much care for Lost in Translation, but this was a super hit for me and became an instant classic in my library. You must see this film for yourself!",10,0,1,5 July 2007
