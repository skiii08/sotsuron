The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Could Have Been Better
","While I appreciate that the movie was split in two parts (honestly there was too much information that had to included to satisfyingly put everything in one single movie) I think the movie and the acting was not done well enough. Jennifer Lawerence is a fantastic individual and honestly can't have enough praise for her; she herself is awkward, much like her character, but there is a huge difference between her awkward and that of Katniss's. And that was made painfully obvious to me. While Katniss is awkward in a social aspect, Jennifer is awkward personality wise. I don't think Jennifer did her best in this part of Mockingjay, thought that the seriousness of the situation was deducted due to Jennifer's acting.",5,0,0,11 August 2016
The Hunger Games," Personal Opinion
","Let it be known that I have read the Hunger Games Trilogy and I loved every word written by Suzanne Collins. But I absolutely HATED the movie. Sure, to a certain degree it followed the overall plot Suzanne had scaled out through out the books, but it fell short in so many different ways that, even if I had already read the books previously, left me craving for more- More information, more action and more character development.Firstly, Garry failed to include important characters that were very important to the book. Like Madge, Katniss's friend who had, in the book, originally given her the Mockingjay pin (not Greasy Sae, the Hob's most popular cook) during her visiting hours before she was shipped to the Capital. He also forgot to include Flavius, Octavia and Venia who become a very important part in the third book (which I will not get into...). Secondly, the movie failed to showcase the relationship and its development between Katniss and Haymitch, Peeta and Cinna. In the book, Katniss and Haymitch originally do not get along by any means but as the book continues you begin to see just how similar the two are to each other which ultimately helps Katniss connect with Haymitch during the games despite there being a lack of contact (hence why she understood the messages he'd send to her via gifts). Between Katniss and Cinna, their relationship was always successful, they clicked the moment they met, mostly because Cinna proved to be different than all the other Capital citizens because of his simplicity (which could be seen by his wardrobe). Ultimately, Cinna and Katniss become very close to each other. And then there was the relationship between Katniss and Peeta... Gosh, you have no idea how angry I was of seeing how little they showed of them. At first, Katniss is very awkward towards Peeta because she knows for a fact that there was a chance that she'd be forced to kill this boy, the boy that years ago saved her life without asking for anything in return. But as they begin spending time together in the training center, encouraging one another to show their true strengths and weaknesses they begin to develop a friendship which is later destroyed when Peeta requests to be trained separately from Katniss when she deems herself too powerful. But as they go into the arena and Peeta does the things he does, Katniss begins to see that Peeta has always been a friend, not a foe. So, when it's time for them to partner up, Katniss begins to treat him better, as a true friend and risks her life for him, like a true friend would do. But as they begin to spend more time together, Peeta's hidden feelings for her develop. But as a way to survive (adviced by Haymitch through one of the gifts) Katniss begins to think that Peeta is only acting and that his affection for her is false and so begins to play along, unknowingly giving Peeta false hopes of a relationship that could probably never exist. So when it's time to go home, after Peeta discovers that it was all an act, it becomes awkward once again because the feelings are no longer mutual, only one sided. Thirdly, the total lack of character development from Peeta. Throughout the movie, the only thing Peeta symbolizes is a middle class citizen that only knows how to whine and stand there to look pretty. In comparison to the book character, Josh Hutcherson playing as Peeta and the original Peeta Mellark become two completely different people. They down play Peeta's character so much that he ultimately becomes irrelevant, when in fact HE CLEARLY ISN'T! They make him into this weak little boy that knows nothing of the outside world but to look pretty in it. When really Peeta Mellark was a strong boy with a very outgoing personality that captures the audience completely, and a boy capable of maintaining a life and the life of the one he loved. In the movie they make Katniss as Peeta's meaning of life, when really, Peeta ultimately becomes Katniss's.Lastly, it was how they cut off so much action from the movie that it lessened the impact of the plot. For example, during the last fighting scene, when Katniss and Peeta are being chased down by the Capital Mutts and they reach the cornucopia and climb it to stay away from them, the director cut off a very important scene that affects the ending of the story entirely. Peeta, in the scene where the same leg that had been cut by Cato during their fight after the Gabbey's' attack was bitten by one of the mutts that ultimately causes Peeta to receive a prosthetic leg. This scene was ultimately essential given that it showcases the Captial's power and advanced technology, which ultimately affects the story later on in the books. Another scene that was completely cut off from the movie that was originally in the book was the scene after Peeta and Katniss win the Games and they are taken back into the hovercraft and Katniss completely breaks down when Peeta is taken into custody to repair his leg and save him from the immense loss of blood he suffered. This scene was essential given the fact that in this scene Suzanne Collins was able to completely explain the after effect of the games. Ultimately, I believe that the movie was basically a cheap trailer that showcases enough of the book to interest the viewer to read the books. Sure the action was minimized to keep the movie PG-13 but you can only eliminate so much blood and gore before you ultimately suck the seriousness out of the situation and turn it into a stupid game.I really think they could've done better without completely copyrighting the entire book, in my opinion.",4,3,5,29 May 2014
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," The Good and The Ugly
","Okay... Why lie? I absolutely loved it! But what I loved above everything else was Credence and his story. Dear God, did I love the roll he played. Not to mention Ezra Miller's acting (Sweet baby Jesus he took my breath away!) I loved what J.K. Rowling so boldly offered for us to witness and especially how the story of Credence played out. It was in now way clich√© and honestly had you holding your breath and always second guessing yourself. I can't praise that part of the movie enough. Or the animation! Jesus, the animation was breath taking!But there was only one thing that put a sour taste in my mouth... And that was definitely the development of romantic relationships. I mean I like romance just as much as the next girl, but I didn't think it fit the heavy atmosphere of the movie. I thought it was totally unnecessary. I didn't like it and I thought it made the plot of the movie deteriorate from its original magnificence. There was too much new information to take on, too much plot to catch up to, and too little character development for me to really appreciate it. Ultimately, I felt that by also including a romantic relationship or the implication of one the director was trying to push too much into a two hour and twelve minute long movie.If that part of the movie, and only that could be extracted, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them would have been the movie to end all fantasy movies.",9,28,54,18 November 2016

","I see most viewers critique and I do see what you all mean when it comes to the 'gaping plot holes' (as said by another viewer) and over concentration on graphics. But you've got to admit that when you see this movie, you get so immersed in this diverged universe that you can't help but completely forget about the plot and what the whole story is even about. I hear you guys when you say that there should have been more background on the characters and their motives for terrorism and I completely agree. It would've been nice to know what happened to planet earth for mere human beings to be desperate for this new world of Pandora and all it offers. But once you see this movie, you can't help but be completely transfixed on the movies graphics and awesome avatars (That kind of look like a bunch of over grown blue mice, to tell the truth.)",6,0,2,29 May 2014
