The Ring," The Ring
",I thought This movie was so awesome! It wasn't scary though but i still thought it was totally great. Like the little girl coming out of the TV was kinda freaky and some of the people who died were kinda gruesome but yeah it was so cool. It was suspenseful and I really thought that made the movie even better. Some parts I don't think made very much sense but i mean lots of horror\\thrillers are like that and I never know what going on at parts. So The Ring i thought was 10\10 because of all of the above. I don't wanna spoil it so I'm not gonna say the favorites and stuff but just for all you readers out there who are obviously reading this just so you know this movie rocks!,8,0,1,29 April 2006
