Blade Runner 2049," K-rap
","Sci-fi seems to have been appropriated and now means 'about nothing so long as the date is sometime in the future'. The original Blade Runner was a detective story not dissimilar to something Humphrey Bogart might have been in. The original Alien was a slasher horror film not dissimilar to Halloween or Friday 13th. The latest Ridley Scott facsimiles (Prometheus & BR 2049) have no underlying style and are therefore boring, slipping in some quasi-Christian rubbish to an otherwise inferior copy of the original films.To sum up, these films are cheating us by copying & pasting a few minutes from a successful film into a boring, going nowhere film and expecting it to fly.",2,24,51,18 October 2017
It," With a silent SH
","I don't like horror films myself, I don't mind the Hammer films of the 1960's and 70's for their DIY charm and how they filmed during the daytime but turned the brightness down to make it look like night.Generally though, horror films are the visual heavy metal to me: not the kind of thing you would choose to pay attention to and if you're one of those who genuinely like it as a genre, then you must have a screw loose.It (with a silent SH) is like most 21st century horror films, all jumps and bursts of noise. More of a visual ride at the theme park than anything remotely scary and awful. This version loses even more of Stephen King's dialogue by setting it in the 1980's and that is a mistake. The only intrigue to Stephen King adaptations is the snippets of dialogue that ring true. What else can I say, this film is bullsh...",1,0,4,18 October 2017
The Irishman," The silence and the regret
","You probably already know that this film is adapted from a book. The events, some effecting twentieth century American history are all faithfully retold like you'd expect from an elderly person telling their life's stories to none other than the FBI; you have to take some of it with a pinch of salt.Where the film director really takes over the storytelling is during the last half hour, where the main character is acutely aware he is alone and it is too late to change. The silence and the regret make viewing his existence very sad, but there is no sympathy.Sombre and indifferent is the emotional tone by the end, probably realistic to those closely related to people who've spent a portion of their lives hurting others.",6,2,3,10 February 2020
Nightcrawler," Taxi Driver was a one-off. Stop trying to copy it Hollywood parasites
","I started out watching this, thinking the 3am atmosphere would be interesting to show how this weirdo character gets to stake his claim in the world. As it WORE on, it more or less glorified the aforementioned weirdo as a pragmatist and the ending was a kick in the king tuts.How many times have we seen Taxi Driver pastiches where the socio/ psycho/ schizo etc has a plan that comes to fruition? The greatest thing about Taxi Driver is we realize the main character doesn't know what he's doing. Bickle is fickle. Flitting from romance, to politics, to social conscience, back to politics. This seems like a better way to describe the thinking of someone who has lost touch with reality.Nightcrawler, however is too much A to B and left me with an uneasy feeling that sick-minded people go unnoticed so long as they do well for themselves. This is untrue. Sick-minded people may well do okay for themselves, but they always leave a wake of clues that others will remember as 'worse than odd' and make it their business to then avoid them at all costs.",1,3,19,7 May 2017
The White Ribbon," I love you Michael Hanneke
","One of the great pleasures of watching a film for the first time is the bubbling of thoughts and ideas going through your mind about where this will all lead and of what meaning is being imbued. The White Ribbon is magnificent in that it keeps this constant inner dialogue alive throughout. By not over-explaining events you end up having a beautifully filmed and edited slice of life at it's most interesting. In life it often takes a period of time until you become fully aware of events and people's involvement in them and it's nourishing to know that your own instincts keep working behind the scenes to help understand things for the future. I love the way The White Ribbon doesn't tie up all loose ends, and although I have only seen it once, I have thought about watching it again many times.My only disagreement with other 10/10 reviewers is the knife and fork linkage to Nazis. I think by inferring that the children of the film will be adults by the time of WW2 is clumsy and pointless. Michael Hanneke has on a few occasions held up the mirror that young people are not all harmless, lovable creatures and that innate fear by adults of this proposition is a much scarier vision than anything WW2 can conjure. It seems the English-speaking world are sick with the idea that nothing could ever be as bad as a Nazi. Hanneke knows better and so do I.",10,1,3,12 April 2017
Yesterday," In spite of the Beatles, will anyone remember this film?
","This film failed on so many levels, yet still had me holding back tears quite a few times during. The reasons it was nowhere near a good film are:
a) the acting is terrible. The main fella is a nobhead who used to be in
EastEnders (a rubbish soap opera), it also has Ed Sheeran, patron saint of
losers playing himself.
b) It is never funny. Richard Curtis films usually have a few funny lines or
scenarios but this one didn't.
c) It looks bland. Danny Boyle usually offers some visual style but again, not
here.However, the leitmotif of reintroducing the Beatles' music to a world that never remembered them was a powerful weapon. Every time a new Beatles song was presented in the film, it was as if that was the first time anyone had heard them and of course they were overwhelmed by how great they sounded.The Beatles were the most important phenomenon in popular culture of the 20th century and by tapping into that force, this film has it's moments of magic but overall is a below average attempt, riding on the coat tails of something truly special.",5,0,0,28 July 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A film about mutual respect
","Rick and Cliff are friends. They are always nice to each other. They don't argue, patronize or resent each other. When we see them separately, they handle themselves well, dignified. When together, there is a tenderness that is best shown as being supportive.This, for me is the ingredient that gives the end of the film such an uplift. Many watchers of this film have commented how they stuck with it and were rewarded by the last quarter. That could lead you to conclude that it's the final scenes that evoke the uplifting feeling I mentioned, which would be quite reductive and perverse, wouldn't it?So it's about the beautiful friendship and how nice it is to see two people interact with each other in that unassuming, largely unspoken way.",10,17,23,10 September 2019
Get Out," Get out of the cinema and git a refund
","This film was sadly lacking in every way: the story was thin and relied on cheesy 'explanation' set ups to try and condense some sense from the slightly drunk narrative. The dialogue was spare and dull; I didn't hear a single laugh in the half full cinema I saw this turkey. Also, the acting was in keeping with the story & script: awful. Daniel Kaluuya has always appeared in good things (Psychoville, Black Mirror) but he can't save what ends up being a film as intense as 'Scary Movie' without any laughs.Get Out has been described as a genre-busting film but I found it to be a Sundance version of that. When I say Sundance, I mean a cheaply made film shot in the northern US states, usually in winter or fall, (autumn for us Anglos)with a dialogue driven narrative and therefore nothing of cinematographic interest nor musical.My idea of a genre-busting film would be Shaun Of The Dead: it uses the genre of horror to drive the narrative but still has a very good script, distinctive characters and an equal blend of audio & visual highlights.Get Out feels like a boring group of people made a film and then kidded everyone they were cool.",1,44,95,11 April 2017
Midsommar," Average Boyfriends Beware
","When this film ended and the credits rolled, I said to myself 'This is boss'. I had glanced at a few comments about Midsommar prior to watching and I heard some baloney about third act blah blah blah and they were totally wide of the mark. This film runs along very nicely and is pitched just right.If I were to wet my finger and hold it to the breeze I would say Midsommar is the feminist movie to die for (see what I did there?). The costumes are aching to be copied by fast fashion, the set designs are intriguing and add a level of strangeness, the music by Bobby Krlic, aka The Haxan Cloak is very very good, reminding me of Karlheinz Stockhausen, Bjork and other (the best ones really) composers.Isn't it funny how so many English, Irish, British actors have to put on crappy American accents to have a chance of a career in film and isn't it even funnier how they keep landing the roles over their American, Canadian counterparts. 51st state my eye.",10,2,8,24 July 2019
Joker," My bird loved it even more than me, but she is mental
","The depiction of early 1980's urban squalor is really well done and helps the story of neglect and unpleasantness come to the fore. Locations, lighting and colour palette all enhance the storytelling, along with the many close ups of the protagonist to create an intense and dizzying cinema experience.The story builds to what is not surprising but still a shocking climax and made me think of urban legends of that time; most notably a man who shot himself live on television. That and the broke culture of the 1970s/ 80s with rubbish piling up in the streets, the dead being stored in cattle sheds because gravediggers were on strike, people having to live intermittently by candlelight because electricity was being rationed and the involuntary three day working week, all, if not literally but evocatively find their way into this film as the cranks that make the pressure more plausible.",8,0,3,21 October 2019
Parasite," Nice fun hijacked by the limousine liberals
","If this film was on the BBC (no adverts) one night I would think it was good fun, well acted, slightly satirical and light as a meringue. Therefore I'd give it 8/10 if asked.
However, this film has been held aloft like Simba by all concerned within the entertainment industry as the 'thing' you need to love and that makes a rebel without a case like me peg my nose.",8,1,5,18 February 2020
Alien: Covenant," What have I become?
","Here in the UK, this film was slagged off before it even came out. Prometheus hurt a lot of us; spiritually, financially, cramp from sitting in the cinema bored stiff for 2.5 hours. So much to my surprise, when me bird suggested we go and see Alien Covenant I reluctantly accompanied her and enjoyed the film as much as was possible.Yes, some of the same devices from previous Alien films are used in this one, but it works somehow. Where Prometheus struggled to hold form, Alien Covenant uses the old set-ups to squeeze a bit of tension and propulsion out of the story, so by the end it was futile to resist that you had just been entertained.This is not an Ingmar Bergman film and will not impress you for the rest of your life but it is good, much better than the toilet media made out and worth a viddy, whether you like Alien or not.",9,4,15,3 June 2017
