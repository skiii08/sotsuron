The Blair Witch Project," Overly-hyped films are often bad. This is no exception.
","If your idea of scary is a girl screaming 'Josh' over and over again in the dark, then you will find this movie scary.  If not, be ready to be disappointed. As a college project it is certainly a very good attempt and probably deserves a B+.  Too bad it has been hyped as something more. If it's scary you are after, better to go to the video store and rent the original 'Psycho,' 'The Thing,' 'The Birds,' or any one of a dozen other classic nail-biters.",2,1,3,7 August 1999
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Worth seeing, BUT..........
","The book was engrossing. The film sticks reasonably close to the original. So - good book, good film. BUT.... The soundtrack is really, really, really annoying!A movie is a careful combination of cinematography, editing, script, acting, sets and location, costumes, score, etc. Invariably when one of these sets out to 'upstage' the rest, the entire production suffers. Too often in this film the background noise - sometime music, more often sound effects - overwhelms all other elements. Almost like a small child screaming 'LOOK AT ME! LOOK AT ME!' I found myself wanting to shout at the screen 'OK. I got it. Now go away.'",7,0,4,23 March 2012
The Sixth Sense," Don't miss this one!
","Let's keep this short and simple - This may very well be the best movie you see this year!  It is extremely well-written, carefully directed, and has some exceptional performances.  And, yes, the ending will knock your socks off!",10,0,0,8 August 1999
