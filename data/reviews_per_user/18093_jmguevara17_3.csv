3:10 to Yuma," Actually Better then the Trailer
","When I saw the trailer for this film, I thought, 'Hey, that looks like it could be good. I'm sick of all these stupid comedies and disgusting horror flicks out right now... this could be a change.' And it was.I think this film was one of the most enjoyable and riveting movies that I have seen all year. Not since last year's departed was I almost falling off the edge of my seat. The action scenes are wonderful and the character building done by Crowe and Bale are 'oscar-worthy' if you want to put it into those terms.Great job everybody! Something to be proud of in the dog-days of summer dumping ground that is September.",10,2,5,14 September 2007
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Condensed Version
","I am a great fan of the books and the movies. My favorite movies are Order of the Phoenix and Prisoner of Azkaban. The first two movies are okay, better for smaller children, but seem to be propelled too much by Chris Colombus's simplistic view of the Potter world.Order of the Phoenix is a great condensed version of the book. When I heard that the larges book was going to be the shortest movie, I was very wary. The Movie, however, eliminates a lot of the not so crucial portions of the book like SPEW. I'm not going to give away everything that the movie is lacking, but most missing portions are not missed at all. I did, however, miss Ron and his Quidich Successes.",10,4,8,23 July 2007
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Truly Awful
","I really hope that this movie is not the biggest hit of the season. The humor is lame, the fight scenes are a blur, and there is barely a plot. I really thought I was watching a different movie when about 6 people clapped afterwards.This movie stooped to some of the most racist and lamest humor I have ever seen in a film. There were many new robot characters introduced, but few were given any lines. Two 'twin' autobots made their 'debut' and were given way too much screen time. They were barely above 'step and fetch-it' cartoons. They were painful to watch with their fake gold teeth and terrible one-liners. If only their juvenile drivel was the end of the pain to the senses. The movie also includes dog humping, mom high on marijuana brownies, and robot balls.Shia is great, he's always great to watch, but Meagan Fox is awful. She just pouts and smirks her whole way through the film. When she cries, she looks like she had to pinch herself to produce crocodile tears.Even with a lack-luster plot and lame potty humor, the action cannot save this lump of a movie. Everything is a blur and you can't tell what's going on. Just take a random action scene from the first movie and transplant it to this new pile, and you wouldn't know the difference. The plot was pretty much explained in the 30 second trailer, so it really doesn't matter if you skip even an hour of this 2:30 hour+ monstrosity.",4,7,17,28 June 2009
