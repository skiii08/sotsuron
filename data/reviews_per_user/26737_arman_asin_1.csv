Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Sasha Baron (????)
","Story:The movie has raised much ado about nothing, causing people to discuss their likes and dislikes about other nationalities. Well...that theme is as old as the world itself. Interracial, inter-cultural and other ethnic conflicts have existed long before they were even registered in chronicles. There are many hot spots on the political map nowadays. I believe there is no need to create anymore: Kazakhs/Uzbeks. Kazakhs/Jews. There was no conflicts between them. However, as Sasha Baron(?) Cohen is a Jew himself...and many of my countrymen are sick and tired of him...i am not sure what 's gonna happen next. Acting: I would rate acting skills of Sasha Cohen as extremely poor - as it does not take much to act as a retard and speak with a fake polish accent. Visuals: unrealistic, fake, the first part of the movie filmed in Romania - what does it have in common with Kazakhstan?? Outcome:My friends' daughter is facing a lot of problems right now in one of the high schools in USA, she is being called a prostitute, urine drinker etc. etc. etc. only because she happened to live in the times of Boratomania and at the very climax of peoples' intolerance towards each other. Many people say Borat has put Kazakhstan on the map...I would be more happy if he did not. I don't mind if young people around the world don't know anything about Kazakhstan rather than being misinformed they develop a constant biased attitude towards kazakhs. Real comment: I am not a humourless person at all. and i can share a great deal of jokes about my country with my people. However i will never allow somebody to make jokes bout my culture and my country under my national symbols and using the name of my capital city. One of the rules of correctness in ethnical humor that the jokes are usually cultivated inside the ethnos.E.g.jokes on gabrov people in Bulgaria,Scottish people in UK, and others - all were born inside the cultural areal. one afro-American can call another '*****' , but he will not let me do it. and i will understand him. Conclusion: we all can be famous and rich by making other people look stupid, however it is not what we believe is appropriate for us. We are above all this. So why then, should we clap our hands in ecstasy and call somebody 'a genius' for doing that?",1,28,62,3 November 2006
