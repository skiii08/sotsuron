Despicable Me 2," If you liked the first, you'll like this one!
","Even more Despicable! Actually this is a sweet turn for the lovable anti-villain villain, Gru (voiced by Steve Carell), who is comfortably back as a bona fide family man, to the three adorable orphans who melted audiences hearts alike in the first film. Gru would seem like a fun father, but he takes his responsibilities overbearingly over the girls as he has trouble accepting them growing up. Not only that, but he struggles to find contentment with no longer being a villain, with his laboratory now transformed into a jam-making factory. Through expected plot development, advocated from a sequel, it is not until a love interest comes along, Lucy Wilde (voiced by Kristen Wiig), that Gru loosen his shell and the plot moves into action. She takes him to the aptly titled 'anti-villain league' who recruit Gru, with Lucy as his partner in anti-crime, to take down a new villain who has taken disguise at a local shopping mall. What better way to take down a villain than with a post-villain. However Gru is not as proficient as he used to be, he is divided and distracted between his responsibilities to his girls, his love for villainous antics and his mixed emotions to his new partner.The plot moves efficiently and effectively, moving briskly but taking special care with the characters whom audience enjoyed the first time around, while injecting a few new ones. Of course this means the minions are back, if ads didn't make it obvious. The uniformly dressed but motley shaped crew seem to have grown exponentially in number, as they are ever present in the film. Even their antics in the background over petty things, prove hilarious, but the pint size helpers also take a pivotal role in the plot. This strikes an interesting point in the films advertising. Hardly any plot was divulged, beyond set-up, meaning that there are plenty of surprises to be had in the film. In fact the minions took the foreground of marketing, being funny without substantiating into crass or being overtly annoying. Not only are they ingenious supporting characters but also act as an ingenious means of marketing the film, without spoiling much of the fun of the film, similarly like Scrat in the Ice Age films. If you only liked them in the first film, you'll love them now. The bottom line (hahaha 'bottom'- you read it in a minion voice didn't you :) is that this is a very comfortable flick. It lives up to the adage, if you liked the first you'll like this one. Colorful and cheerful animation, that is quite impressive, with more minion madness, as expected, punctuated by heart warming sentiment, in good measure.",8,27,51,25 June 2013
First Man," Not exactly a biopic, nor a comprehensive account of the moon landing; First Man feels conflicted
","For a largely uncharted territory, space has proven to be well-trodden ground in film. From Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity, which offered a uniquely visceral perspective into the sheer force of will necessary to survive above Earth, to Hidden Figures, which provided valuable insight into the overlooked behind the scenes work of female minorities at NASA, there have been no shortages of quality space films over the past few years. For his fourth feature film, acclaimed director Damien Chazelle, provides his own addition to the space race by charting the life of Neil Armstrong in the years leading up to him becoming the first man on the Moon. While ostensibly a film about Armstrong, it would be remiss to call First Man a biopic. The film splits its focus between Armstrong's family life and the intense weight his mission bore down on his loved ones, while simultaneously trying to glorify the magnitude of his achievement as a sort of hagiography. By trying to have it both ways, First Man feels conflicted and struggles to provide a fresh perspective on well-documented history.Part of the problem lies in Armstrong's inherent nature. As an introverted individual, Ryan Gosling's performance comes off as accordingly cold and distant. He embodies Armstrong as a quiet, contemplative man who mostly keeps to himself and is singularly focused on the success of the mission. The blandness of Gosling's performance may be misconstrued as shallow characterisation but he successfully communicates Armstrong's stoic determination that was necessary for the lunar mission to succeed. The issue, however, is that the film never successfully matches his low-key nature with enough dramatic heft (particularly as the outcome of the lunar landing is well-known history), leaving long stretches of the story feeling dry and uninvolving.In fact, most of Armstrong's personality traits can be gleamed from his relationship with his wife, Janet Shearon, played with powerful force by Claire Foy. Without a doubt, the most effective dramatic scenes are the ones shared between Gosling and Foy. A dutiful housewife and loving mother, Foy's Shearon is no pushover and she stands her ground against the boys club that is NASA. When Armstrong attempts to leave for the Apollo mission without saying goodbye to their sons, she confronts him emphatically and forces a family sit down. Her assertive nature clashes sharply with Armstrong's nonchalance, and she offers a stark psychoanalytical counterpoint to him. However, the film defers digging too deep into Armstrong's psychological state by keeping the lunar mission in the forefront of the narrative and his family life as ancillary, in case it would lessen the reverence surrounding his achievement. You only get glimpses of his home life and the resulting fractured sense of characterisation is likely to leave you feeling more conflicted about who Neil Armstrong was by the film's end.The other part of the problem is that, as a retelling of the trials and tribulations of the lunar lading, the film is hardly an exhaustive account. Covering the time period from 1961, when Armstrong was an X-15 pilot, to the eventual Apollo 11 mission in 1969, the constant jumps in time leave little room for detailed recreations of both the physical and mental preparations that went into putting the first man onto the moon. Moreover, certain contextual details of the time period are touched upon but quickly go by the wayside, such as one scene depicting African American musicians singing the lyrics of Gil Scott-Heron's 'Whitey on the Moon' which hints at a fascinating social-political subtext to the story that never arrives. Thus, those seeking a fact-based take are better off seeking one of the countless documentaries on the moon landing.Instead, First Man exists in a middling space (pun unintended) where it's easy to see the passion behind the film but hard to see its exact raison d'etre. It's respectfully made, but perhaps too much so, seemingly content on re-treading past achievements by fairly conventional means. Where First Man excels is in its more personal touches, in particular in its handling of grief and trauma, stemming from Armstrong's personal loss of one of his children, as both fuel and a drawback to his professional pursuit. It's a through line that is poignantly tied off in one of the film's closing scenes and it's this sort of nuance that feels like it offers something fresh to the story, despite its historical trappings.Ultimately, while it's easy to admire the craft behind the film and the respectful means by which it treats its main subject, First Man's resistance to probe too deep into Armstrong's psychology or to provide a fresh, modern perspective on well-documented history leaves it, too often, feeling lost in space.",6,13,23,13 October 2018
It," A worthy adaptation of Stephen King's classic novel
","If the recent spate of clown sightings are any indication, scary clowns are back in vogue. It's unsurprising then, and probably largely to blame, that a new adaptation of Stephen King's iconic 1986 horror novel, IT, has arrived. Ever since King introduced the world to his maniacally devious creation, Pennywise the Dancing Clown, party clowns have had it tough maintaining an innocuous image and the new film does little to help their cause.Stepping into the oversized shoes, Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd casts an intimidating figure as Pennywise. With his towering height and creepy grin, and aided by a thick coat of makeup and prosthetics, his Pennywise is effectively creepy and unsettling. Unfortunately the film's over reliance on jump scares and telegraphed gotcha moments means that he, and the film itself, never really rises above that level to become truly terrifying. Despite this, the horror serves a greater purpose than just to scare you and it's the allegorical nature of the story that makes IT a stronger coming of age fable than horror film.King, who is no stranger to great coming of age stories having written the novella behind the 1986 film Stand By Me, adeptly captured youthful woe and the tight bond of adolescent friendship under the guise of a horror in his novel. It's a focus that director Andy Muschietti rightfully doesn't stray from in his adaptation. Featuring a strong young cast, the film takes its time to explore the characters as they deal with their repressed emotions, burgeoning libidinal drives and tempestuous relationships with their parents or parental figures. It's these coming of age elements that elevate IT from just a decent horror film to a great film period. And as the end titles reveal, this is only Part 1, with an imminent return to these characters and their world an exciting prospect.",7,2,6,14 September 2017
Baby Driver," Edgar Wright's Baby Driver is a pulsating drive through the mind of a virtuoso talent
","It's been four years between drinks for fans of Edgar Wright. While remnants of his involvement remain in 2015's Ant Man, they ultimately underline the overall disappointment of what could have been. Luckily he's back and firing on all cylinders with his action/music hybrid Baby Driver, a stylish update of the old-school heist flick. It's Wright's most commercial film to date and coincidentally his first to film in the US. Using the streets of Atlanta, Georgia as his own personal racecourse, Edgar Wright's Baby Driver is a pulsating drive through the mind of a virtuoso talent, whose impeccable track record speaks for itself.In his first headlining role, Ansel Elgort is Baby Driver, the baby-faced getaway driver who times his chases to the beat of a specifically curated soundtrack. Baby suffers from Tinnitus, the result of a childhood car crash that killed both his parents. The music allows him to block out the ringing in his ears, helping him to focus and heightening his driving ability. His talent catches the interest of criminal mastermind Doc (Kevin Spacey), who organises bank robberies across the Atlanta metropolitan area. In dire financial straits, Baby agrees to work heists for him but after meeting Debora (Lily James), a waitress in a local diner, he becomes eager to get out of a life of crime and start a new life with her. However, deep in debt with Doc, Baby realises that finding a fresh start may be harder than just speeding away.Perhaps the only disappointing thing about the film is that it plays on the familiar heist trope of a 'one last job' without offering much to subvert expectations. It's a cliché that Michael Mann has worked many times over in films such Thief and Heat, and fans of those sorts of films will be able to guess the general arc of Baby Driver's story from beginning to end. The biggest deviation is that, while those films typically feature older career-criminals looking for a comfy retirement, Baby Driver features a younger, fresh-faced protagonist whose strings are being pulled from higher up. As a result, it's hard not to root for Baby as he tries to regain control over his life and put it back on track. He's a likable enough character and after losing both of his parents at a very young age, he is just trying his best to make something of his life, even if that means veering off into crime. Besides, while the narrative may play it a little safe, it's the skill and flair in which the familiar story is told that stands out. A kick-ass soundtrack and kinetic action sequences pave Baby's road to redemption, and they work symbiotically to produce a sort of action poetry that will have you hanging on to every word.From the opening scene played to the rocking rhythm of Jon Spencer Blues Explosion's 'Bellbottoms', the film lets the audience know early on that the music is an integral part of the film's diegesis. In the scene, Baby is sitting in his car waiting for his accomplices as they rob a nearby bank. However, instead of idling around, the camera follows him as he grooves and sings along to the music. With the fast cutting and sweeping camera, Wright manages to elicit more excitement from the inside of the car than from the action occurring just outside. It's impressively put together and Wright stages it similarly to his 2003 music video Mint Royale's 'Blue Song', except with over a decade more of filmmaking experience allowing him to hone his talent. This is most evident in the precision in which the scene plays out as, on cue with the music, his accomplices jump into the car and Baby puts the pedal to the metal, roaring down the highway cops in tow. The shift to full-blown action is facilitated by the beat of the music, and it's this type of pinpoint precision that puts Baby Driver a cut above standard action fare.The film is filled with these types of stylistic flourishes, and they never feel superfluous even when they are indulgent. In one scene Baby goes on a morning coffee run listening to 'Harlem Shuffle' by Bob & Earl and the lyrics become part of the mise-en-scène, appearing as graffiti on street murals. The scene is so stylishly pulled off that it feels essential despite not adding much to the overall narrative. Then, in the last 20 or so minutes of the film, Baby Driver hits high gear with a slew of exhilarating chase sequences that will make your head spin as the film races towards the checkered flag with lightning speed.There is, however, a (ever so slight) disappointing feeling that the film lacks the belly-busting humour of Wright's previous works, in particular Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. Given how effectively Wright has married action and comedy before, it would have been good to see a bit more of his trademark humour peppered throughout the film, such as the hilarious Mike Myers/ Michael Myers mask mix up scene. Although the decision to focus largely on the action may have been a purposeful one by Wright whose British comedies haven't exactly brought in box office gold stateside. Despite amassing a loyal fan base over the years, the cult filmmaker has yet to have a bona fide box office hit, but he seems determined to change that with Baby Driver. Overall, Baby Driver is a triumph of style over substance. It turns the chase film into high-art without challenging the viewers' expectations of the genre. While the story lacks surprises, the film's inventive chase sequences and perfectly tuned soundtrack make it irresistibly entertaining. After all it's not the destination but the ride that makes Baby Driver worth jumping on board for. And it's a ride worth taking over and over. Now when can we get a Baby Driver sing along version?",8,4,8,18 July 2017
Toy Story 4," A sequel that didn't need to be made...but I'm glad it was!
","As far as conclusions to beloved franchises go, Toy Story 3 is hard to beat. The film tugs at the heartstrings, as we learn that Andy's toys are no longer his, and cuts deep with the realisation that growing up means letting go.Naturally, I had a lot of trepidation heading into Toy Story 4. It wasn't so much about whether the film would be good or not, as Pixar have been pretty reliable in that regard. Rather it was about whether, despite the best efforts from everyone involved, Toy Story 4 would be able to shake off feeling unnecessary. Well, I'm happy to report that not only is Toy Story 4 a triumph, but the film's heartfelt finale feels like a proper send-off for Woody and his friends and proves that it was a story that needed to be told.The best way to summarise is that Toy Story 3 is the end of Andy's story, while Toy Story 4 is (likely) the end of the toys' story.While essentially a roadtrip film, the story focuses on the toys finding their place in the outside world for the first time and it's hard not to draw the analogy between young adults moving out of home. The film captures the feeling of uncertainty but also the new found possibility that leaving a place of comfort entails and it's a joy to see the series mature along with the kids who first watched Toy Story back in 1995.It is also, undoubtedly, the funniest Toy Story film, largely due to a bevy of hilarious new supporting characters. Forky is a definite highlight while Keanu Reeves steals his scenes as Duke Caboom and Key and Peele bring their expert comedic timing to a pair of carnival-prize plush toys who are attached together by their hands but bounce off each other like rubber balls.Thanks to a consistently funny script, the film is a blast to watch when it's not making your eyes well up, but either way the film will likely leave you crying. If you're still skeptical about the film, let me just say that, nine years may have passed between sequels, but the series' heart is beating as strong as ever.",9,824,1116,16 June 2019
The Lion King," If Anything, It's a Monumental Technical Achievement
","As nature documentaries go, the modern remake of The Lion King (2019) gives some of the best a run for their money, quite literally. With a $250 million price tag, it achieves digitally what David Attenborough has spent his life capturing on camera. The result is jaw-droppingly photorealistic, but it also makes for a strange first impression. Imagine watching a Disneynature feature but with actors reading The Lion King screenplay over the top of it and the effect would be eerily similar. It takes time to accept lifelike looking animals talking like cartoon characters, but the ground-breaking technical skill in which they are brought to life makes the bumpy journey worthwhile.Every tress of fur, crack in the arid soil and sun-swept vista is rendered in such immense detail that it's unsurprising that many people are calling this reboot live-action. It's a monumental technical achievement and the level of visual fidelity on display alone warrants seeing this film on the biggest screen possible.However, in terms of the story, the film follows the original so closely that it can't help but feel second rate. Scene-by-scene, it dutifully ticks off the story beats of the 1994 original, with little by way of surprises in-between. It also doesn't help that film's photo-realism unavoidably limits the ability of the animals to convey emotion without looking unnatural or (naturally) cartoonish, and the result is a film that often creates indifference where there should be wonder. With jaw-dropping visuals, plenty of humour and solid renditions of timeless songs, it's hard to see this modern remake failing but, as it turns out, The Lion King's (2019) biggest achievement also ends up being its biggest flaw.",7,461,756,12 July 2019
Brave," Pixar Know How To Tell A Good Story
","A more conventional fable than what we have come accustomed to from Pixar, but a solid one none the less. While it may not stand amongst their creative best, the film is still a stunningly animated delight. It is supported by a strong central character and a mother-daughter relationship that resonates with the film's central value of family. It's a tale that will appeal to both adults and children alike.It is mostly disappointing as the film plays it quite safe as compared to previous Pixar films and it becomes decidedly predictable by the end. However that's the problem when you build such a fantastic repertoire for animated films, expectations are always high for the next. This shouldn't detract from the fact that the film deserves all the success it gets and to the people who were already disappointed by Cars 2 (which i still enjoyed), Pixar is back to its roots here- prioritizing telling a good story first.",8,3,5,24 June 2012
Hotel Mumbai," At its core, Hotel Mumbai is a celebration of human resilience and courage in the face of overwhelming evil
","On the 26th November 2008, a group of young men armed with explosives and AK-47s stormed the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, the result of a terror spree sweeping across key locations in Mumbai. With instructions being fed to them through an earpiece, the amateur terrorists succeeded in laying siege to the hotel, spreading a trail of chaos and destruction across each floor, in a tragedy that remains seared in the minds of all those who survived.In capturing the intensity of the siege, director Anthony Maras effectively splits the film's focus between the staff and guests of the hotel in their fight to survive and the role of the perpetrators in co-ordinating the attacks. With the Mumbai police forces completely unprepared for an attack of this magnitude, the reign of terror lasted three days and the film is relentless in its display of gratuitous violence. Near the beginning, bullets scatter across a packed lobby as bodies drop like flies and the attackers continue their march to the upper floors where, room by room, they shoot unsuspecting guests. Thirty-one individuals lost their lives during the chaos and by not shying away from the ugliness of the act, Maras paints an unnerving picture of the callous disregard the terrorist showed their victims.However, the film's perpetual forward momentum means that the violence slowly becomes desensitising and at times teeters on the edge of exploitative Hollywood action territory. The film uses a fair amount of dramatic license to keep events thrilling and sometimes it seems to paint a real-life event in very broad action strokes. Luckily, any detour into action hero territory is quickly dispelled by a screenplay that presents heroes in all shapes and forms.Indeed, what stands apart, is the strength of the character portraits that emerge amongst the violence. Dev Patel and Anupam Ker play hotel employees who stand by their colleagues and guests at all costs, while Armie Hammer and Nazanin Boniadi play a married couple who risk it all to protect their child. While the characters may be fictional, it's not hard to imagine numerous stories just like theirs having occurred in real life. Moreover, by interspersing their stories with first hand news footage of the siege, Maras injects an extra element of realism that convincingly ties the film together.At its core, Hotel Mumbai is a celebration of human resilience and courage in the face of overwhelming evil. By focusing on the humanity amongst the carnage, Hotel Mumbai honours all those who risked, and lost, their lives in the attack.",8,151,480,4 March 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," A winning combination of infectious energy, gorgeous aesthetic and laugh out loud humour
","In 2014, Guardians of the Galaxy catapulted relatively unheard of superheroes into the hearts of millions of Marvel Cinematic Universe fans worldwide. Three years later and looking to jack up their prices as two-time galaxy savers, the Guardians make a triumph return with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Eschewing the need to outdo the first in terms of spectacle, the sequel offers a more mature and deeper look into the ragtag group of lovable miscreants. The characters once again prove to be the highlight of the show, and by putting the spotlight firmly on them and their relationship with each other, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 delivers a satisfying sequel despite the uneven storytelling.Opening with another memorable credits sequence, we reunite with the Galactic heroes on a new assignment. Hired by a gold-skinned race called the Sovereign to take down a giant inter- dimensional monster eating their planet's power, it's business as usual for the crew. That is until Rocket steals the power that they were meant to be protecting and the crew swiftly find themselves on the run from the Sovereign's fleet of drones. Old habits die-hard after all. Except the chase doesn't last long before the Guardians crash land on a nearby planet. Stranded, they are aided by a mysterious stranger who, if the trailers hadn't already spoiled the surprise, is revealed to be Peter's dad, Ego (Kurt Russell). The father-son reunion forms the crux of the story, and with the group left with few options, they split into two. Ego invites Peter to his home planet, and he follows along with Gamora and Drax, while Rocket and Groot stay to tend to the ship. As the characters break up, the story also splinters into a tangled web of subplots, and there's not much pulling them all together. Each character is given their own arc and we learn a little more about each of them, especially Peter and his relationship with his father, but there's nothing really pushing the story forward. There's no real villain, no imminent threat and only hints of something nefarious bubbling under the surface which lends a decidedly lack of urgency to the center of the film. Having said that, even when the story does slumber, there's always something to distract your senses. The film's presentation is once again stellar and it not only elevates the film but at times it feels like the film gets by solely because of it. The bright, fluorescent colour palette nails the trippy, free spirited 70's aesthetic and locations such as Ego's beautifully, CGI rendered home planet are a feast for the eyes. Much like the first, the film is a marvel (pun intended) to look at.Your ears are also in for a treat as the film's new mix tape (aptly titled Awesome Mix Vol 2.) is another killer. The soundtrack has been carefully curated as an integral part of the film and the inspired song choices reflect that. Drawing once again on classic tunes, the soundtrack is populated by the likes of Fleetwood Mac and Cat Stevens, who perfectly compliment the film's eclectic mix of drama, action and comedy. Even the bizarre addition of an original song called 'Guardians Inferno' sung by David Hasselhoff feels inspired and is likely to be stuck in your head for days after.Despite the mid-film lull, the story does recover, and a late game twist pulls it back into top-form. It's a dark revelation that threatens to pull the group apart but instead serves to bring them closer together. It highlights the strength of the film, that even amidst all the action and razzle-dazzle special effects, it's the characters which standout and endure. Their resolve to stick together as a family, through thick and thin, is what makes the characters so great to follow and the film's heartfelt coda encapsulates this perfectly.It should be noted, however, that those expecting for the film to pave the way for Avengers 3 are going to leave the theatre somewhat disappointed, as the narrative is surprisingly self-contained for this stage of Marvel's Phase 3. While it has been confirmed that the Guardians will appear in the third Avengers film, there's nothing in Vol.2, not even in one of the five (yes FIVE) end-credits sequences, which remotely hints at the Guardians involvement with the Avengers. For that matter, very little at all of what happens seems to have an impact on the overarching MCU universe. While that's not exactly a complaint, given Marvel's penchant for constantly teasing of bigger to come, there's a slight disappointing feeling to Vol 2 that it acts mostly as filler. In the end, however, it's hard to complain when the film is as enjoyable and well made as this. While not exactly the breathe of fresh air that the first one was, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2's winning combination of infectious energy, gorgeous aesthetic and laugh out loud humour more than makeup for the uneven storytelling.",7,2,5,12 June 2017
The Shape of Water," A fairy tale for our troubled times
","A classic love story with a reptilian twist, Guillermo del Toro's latest love letter to cinema, The Shape of Water, is a marvel to behold. Set against the backdrop of 1960's America and the accompanying Cold War paranoia, each frame of the film feels meticulously crafted. Marked by dark shadows and moody lighting, the film has a distinct noir feel. Yet punctuating the aesthetic gloom is a story brimming with light and indefatigable charm. It's del Toro's most sophisticated work to date, a master-class in mood setting and emotionally affecting filmmaking, even if it feels a little too self-satisfied at times.The story follows Eliza (Sally Hawkins), a mute janitor who feels 'incomplete'. She lives in a quaint apartment atop of a movie theatre and spends her days as a cleaner in a top-secret government facility. There she falls in love with an amphibious fish-like being (Doug Jones) who is imprisoned by the government and subject to cruel studies and experiments. Taken aback by the way the creature sees her for what she is, not what she isn't, she falls in love and conspires with her co-worker (Octavia Spencer) and neighbour (Richard Jenkins) to break the creature out.Once the love story takes shape, it doesn't deviate from the expected. Del Toro seems less interested in developing a complex narrative but rather providing depth through the film's mise-en-scene. While, at times, this makes the story feel a little stagnant and complacent, del Toro is nothing if not a distinct visual stylist. Set in 1962 Baltimore, the quintessential Americana setting is juxtaposed with French styled influences. The film's whimsical elements feel like del Toro channelling the work of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, with the music, quirky characters, quaint sets and surreal slant all trademarks of Jeunet's work. The film is a celebration of cinema just as much as it is about the power of imagination. It's a joy to behold and a latter half homage to Fred Astaire, by way of standout musical number, is one of the many inspired choices throughout the film.What allows the narrative to flourish, however, is Sally Hawkins' emotionally charged performance. She is able to communicate a wealth of emotion without uttering a single word. Her delicate and understated performance anchors the fanciful story and provides nuance to the central romance between Eliza and the creature. The companionship they share is one of deep humanity and, in a world too quick to judge, Hawkins' layered performance ensures their relationship never feels unbelievable. The Shape of Water is ultimately a story about the importance of communication and understanding at a time when otherness was seen as threatening and unwelcome. The parallels to the present day are not hard to draw and while the story plays it a little safe, del Toro paints it with a tenderness few artists achieve. The purity of vision on display is the work of master auteur and something seen far too rare these days. The Shape of Water is a classic love story, told with modern relevance and truly a tale for our troubled times.",9,32,58,29 January 2018
American Made," An entertaining take on an unbelievable true story
","If American Made proves one thing it's that truth is stranger than fiction. The story of American aircraft pilot Barry Seal who became a drug smuggler working for the Medellin cartel, casually rubbed shoulders with Pablo Escobar and ran a massive money laundering operation all while being employed by the CIA, would seem a stretch even by Hollywood's standards. Yet it's precisely the 'based on true events' part of Seal's story that makes American Made such a fascinating film to watch.We are first introduced to Seal as a disillusioned TWA pilot looking for something to put the thrill back in his life. When approached by the CIA to fly reconnaissance of communist factions in South America, he immediately jumps at the opportunity. Flying solo from the US on his own private two- engine plane, it's not long before Seal is intercepted by the Medellin cartel and offered large amounts of cash to smuggle drugs into the US. Ever the opportunist, Seal agrees and soon finds himself playing on both sides of the law and making more money than he knows what to do with. But as the demands from both sides grow increasingly untenable, Seal finds himself stuck between a rock and a hard place, with his luck quickly drying up.Tom Cruise brings his manic charisma to the role of Seal, and he's a good fit for the highflying, larger than life character. It's hard not to look with contempt at a man who transported illegal narcotics into the US en masse, but Cruise does a good job in humanising Seal and portraying him as more than just a criminal. At heart, Seal is a family man looking to provide for his wife and daughter but whose unrelenting pursuit of the American dream finds him working on both sides of the law. The charisma Cruise brings to the role goes a long way in making Seal an endearing protagonist, and he seems to have fun in the role. Following the underwhelming performance of The Mummy earlier this year, American Made represents a return to form for him and a welcome return to the more grounded narratives in which he fares far better with. Director Doug Liman (Edge of Tomorrow, Fair Game) complements Cruise's commanding performance with his highly energised filming style. The camera is rarely steady for more than a beat and its constant zooming, shaking and moving around lends the film an effective faux doco feel. On the flipside, however, the incessant camera movements are distracting during some of the quieter moments in the film. In one simple conversation scene in a diner, near the beginning of the film, the camera haphazardly changes angles and abruptly zooms in towards the characters as they speak. It's awkwardly staged and distracts from the dialogue. Luckily the film moves at such a fast clip that Liman's hyperactive filming works mostly well but some restraint would have gone a long way during the smaller scenes.Overall American Made is a fascinating biopic about a larger than life character. The film benefits greatly from Cruise's committed performance and Liman's lively direction to provide an entertaining take on an unbelievable true story.",8,22,39,5 September 2017
Ice Age: Continental Drift," Keeps the series going strong!
","Fantastic film! As a fan of the series, i was a bit skeptical that they were taking it too far however, if this film is any indication, the series is as strong as ever! You feel comfortable returning to the characters for another adventure and i don't see fans of the series being disappointed. The film is fast and fun and carries excellent messages of the importance of family and the importance of being yourself. A bunch of new characters freshen up the film, with a band of pirates, including a love interest for Diego and Sid is accompanied by his grandmother who is humorously oblivious to the dangerous situations the characters get into. Scrat also gets plenty of time chasing his elusive acorn, with the footage that was released as part of advertisements (Scrat's Continental Crack-Up)comprising in the film. However, there is also a hilarious scene at the end where he finally reaches the treasure island that the map on the acorn (seen in the advertisements) leads to. A great, fun, family film that boasts crisp and detailed animation that actually makes great use of 3D. Definitely recommended! *The short film that precedes the film, 'The Longest Daycare'- a Simpsons short, is a pleasant addition to the main film. It is a silent short that features Maggie Simpson and Baby Gerald, where Maggie tries to save a butterfly from the daycare from the clutches of the baby. It is clever and fun and it is great to see more films having original shorts like Pixar's fantastic ones.",8,58,95,24 June 2012
Parasite," Achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us
","As a film about a family imposing on another, and keeping dark secrets hidden beneath the surface, Parasite achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us: tell a multi-layered story in a widely entertaining manner, but without sacrificing the believability of its central narrative.That's not to say that Us is an ineffective film by any means, but when it comes to crafting weighty social commentaries under the guise of lighter fare, writer-director Bong Joon-ho is in a class of his own.The film follows a lower-class South Korean family as they slowly integrate themselves in the lives of an upper-class family and their lavish household. As their entanglement is spun out of a web of deceit, the lowly family find themselves skating on thin ice when it comes to keeping up appearances.It's a twisty satire on social-economic disparities in South Korean society that swings broadly in tone, and sometimes threatens to tip over the edge, but never feels less than meticulously calculated in its tonal shifts.However, to reveal anything more about the story would be to take away from the overall experience, as each act is marked by a major plot twist or revelation that keeps the film one step ahead of the viewer at all times. Go in blind if you can and expect an unforgettable ride.",9,274,451,2 July 2019
Mother!," A film defined by binary oppositions, for better yet for worse
","As the end credits rolled for mother!, Darren Aronofsky's latest esoteric cinematic offering, I was torn. On the one hand it takes at least an hour for the film to start getting interesting, and my patience was tested more than once over its protracted two hour running time. Yet on the other hand the film's switch into full blown, boundary pushing craziness in the last half an hour is something that has to be seen to be believed. Whether it's worth trudging through to reach depends on your tolerance for artsy, self-indulgent filmmaking that's intended to frustrate and provoke. What's even more shocking is the knowledge that mother! comes from a major studio, with Paramount staking its brand for a film that's surely going to divide audiences.Jennifer Lawrence stars as the titular mother, a dutiful housewife to her writer husband (played by Javier Bardem). Living together in their countryside mansion, their peaceful bucolic life is disrupted when a stranger enters their home, setting off a chain of events that quickly spirals out of control. To describe anymore of the plot would be difficult as the film is steeped in symbolism and metaphors that are not easily unpacked. The film becomes increasingly unhinged and abstract, and it invites a plethora of interpretations but offers no definitive answers. Is it a self-reflective indictment of the vanity of artists? A metaphor for the callousness of humans? Or just a reflection of Aronofsky's anger at the present state of the world? The oblique narrative will prove frustrating for many, with reactions likely to range from calling it pretentious trash to an artsy masterpiece, and neither would be a wrong assessment. It's a film defined by binary oppositions; it's ugly yet beautiful, frustrating yet exciting, and all undeniable singular in its vision, for better yet for worse.Some will say that the film will not appeal to mainstream tastes. I don't think that's fair because that implies there's something wrong with the audience and not the film itself. But if the intent of art is to provoke and elicit a response from it's audience then mother! succeeds unequivocally. It's an angry film, which it harnesses to stir up and provoke viewers. So take the star rating with a grain of salt, as it's reductive of the film's intent. Perhaps the most blunt thing I can say is that while I didn't particularly enjoy my time with mother!, I can't say I regret watching it either.",5,1,9,15 September 2017
