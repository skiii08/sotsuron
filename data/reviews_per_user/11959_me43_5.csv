The Devil's Advocate," 'The Firm' taken one step further
","'The Devil's Advocate' explores and expands upon themes introduced to moviegoers in 'The Firm', but with a mythical overlay. (I realize both films are based on books, but the analogy still works.) 'The Devil's Advocate' doesn't take itself too seriously, which is good, as the harsh themes could have mired it down completely.The director didn't quite trust our ability to understand some of the point plots without bludgeoning us over the head with them, but sometimes that can be forgiven.  Acting in The Devil's Advocate is uneven and at times, gloriously over the top. Keanu Reeves, I am coming to realize, is cursed with a face too placidly built to express emotions convincingly. The scene where he is crying out while holding his wife illustrates what I mean. While his anguished voice and actions are muted by the lack of plasticity in his face, his pain is evident. I think his best bit of acting comes from the scene where he has alternating bodies under his thrusting loins. In those moments his face is more expressive than I can ever recall seeing it, and he seems more 'real' than he has since 'Bill and Ted'. (The only film I ever recall him looking really happy in.)Ms Theron, as usual, told volumes with each nuanced glance, and Al Pacino is delicious as the modern era devil, one of the last roles before he started phoning it in with recycled personas. (The Insider, Simone, The Recruit) Naming his character 'John Milton' is splendid irony. I get a big kick out of the look on his face as he threatens to plunge a finger in the basin of consecrated water. The devil as mischievous school-boy, reminding us of why he 'fell' in the first place.The nudity, while a bit too much for my tastes, was curiously more sensual than sexual, and the near ending brought to mind the 'Bobby in the shower scene' from Dallas...If you believe in the devil, this film can be disturbing. If you don't, it can be an interesting romp on the darker side. Take it at the value the director assigned it and you can be entertained for a few hours.",6,0,2,26 November 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Fun on first viewing, logic dulls the fun on the second.
","'Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl' is weird and wonderful; funny and droll, but cannot stand up over repeated viewings.(Well, it can, if you check your brain at the door before taking your seat.)I mean, come on now! Six, count 'em, six writers, and hundreds of workers on the film and NO ONE pointed out that the main plot falls under the film's own rules? Should we not expect more from Disney and Bruckheimer? Oh. I forgot. Disney is adept at making lies into 'popular fact'... such as their enduring lie that lemmings commit mass suicide (they pushed the little fellers off the cliff to their doom!) and teaches moms are expendable, a subtle misogyny, and more, to little kids in their animated films. (Not so subtle is the showing of a woman being hit by men... twice! Once by a large black man, enforcing nasty stereotypes, and then by the pirate captain.) Then there is Jerry Bruckheimer, well, his career has been uneven, at best. From 'Con Air' and 'Top Gun' to 'Kangaroo Jack' and lots of television stuff, so perhaps we should expect non-thinking films from him.So, don't examine the premise closely or it will unravel like an old knit sweater.Before you holler about it being a kid movie, realize PG-13 is NOT a 'kid movie' and Capt. Sparrows obsession with eunuchs (also see deleted scenes) is certainly NOT appropriate for the minds of 13 year old males, (who are embarking on a critical stage of sexual development with its attendant castration fears) let alone younger children. With the DVD release coinciding with the Yule season, a lot of youngsters will be getting this film, which is exactly as the marketers intended. Besides, 13 year olds are bright enough to question the film's violations of its own internal logic... even little kids are adept at pointing out movie inconsistencies these days. Taking it too seriously, you say? Well, watch the extras on the DVD, the makers took this film seriously, and obviously intended we would also.**** *** ** Warning! Logic Ahead! ** *** ****If Miss Swan's corset was so tight she could not breathe, and she fainted from it, then what reserve of air was in her lungs that she could survive the plunge to the depths and back up again?Ol' funny eye screamed about being burned, but the cursed has no feeling as Captain Barbossa informs us.How is it the cursed carried such wonderful fresh food aboard a ship when for a decade they have been unable to eat? Any food aboard makes no sense. Apples in the Caribbean in the 18th century? And how is it the blade plunged into Barbossa has blood on it when withdrawn?If the cursed cannot 'die' (and we repeatedly see them walk away after mortal wounds), then why is it that 'William 'Bootstrap' Turner' - who was cursed by stealing the medallion - stayed dead upon being thrown to 'Davy Jones' Locker'? The other medallions were on the Isle so don't say it was because he sent the medallion to his son. If the cursed pirates can walk the ocean depths, then why not ol' Bootstrap?If Capn' Sparrow can immediately become a dead and cursed skeleton upon stealing the gold medallion, then why didn't Elizabeth when she stole that same medallion in the cavern? Or young Mr. Turner who also stole it. If it makes one immediately cursed, and dead, and the dead can't bleed, how came it to be that Will Turner could bleed and thereby release the curse?Why is it blood was not required of every other piece of gold retrieved?If Isle de la Muerta is only found by those already knowing its location, (and still a special compass is needed) then how did the Commodore's ship find it? There was a huge squall when Sparrow made way to the isle in the 'fastest ship in the fleet', so they could not have followed.What is it with Depp's accent? It doesn't quite belong anywhere, and he acts as though he is blitzed or something throughout the whole film... (he marred 'Chocolate', one of my favorite films, with his dreadful Irish accent!) if you look carefully, you can catch sight of some of his tattoos. I wonder how he felt making the little 'France' joke, which obviously caters to the current American distaste for the country. (More blatant and foul in the deleted scene for it, with its allusions to eunuchs, the French, and mayonnaise.) Screenwriters should be careful in period films about modern allusions as they invoke stream of consciousness thoughts, causing the mind to wander from the film, possibly never to return. If the mind does not make the connection, then there is no point to the allusion. Screen writing Russian Roulette, guys.For fun, you can even sneak a peek at Bloom's LOTR elvish tattoo on his right lower forearm. I suspect he will come to regret such obvious placement. (Elijah Wood was probably wise in getting his placed below the belt line.) Bloom is an up and coming actor and I look forward to seeing him in new roles.And so on. At this writing, Disney is just releasing its second film based on one of its rides, 'The Haunted Mansion' it seems to be getting little fanfare, so maybe the trend will stop. It is, of course, better than them ruining great old films by filming remakes.On the plus side, Rush is impressive as usual, and if you let the film just wash over you it can be fun. At least the first time around.",Null,0,2,6 December 2003
JFK," Occam's Razor and Oliver Stone
","'JFK' has been controversial from the moment of its inception. Its director, Oliver Stone, has been reviled as a revisionist and heralded as a visionary.
The film 'JFK' seeks to vindicate Jim Garrison, the former DA of New Orleans, who wholeheartedly believed a conspiracy existed to kill President Kennedy, and to shut up anyone who came too close to 'the truth'.If we could slake off all these years since 1963, or even 1991, we would see how drastically the average person's view has changed. The vast majority now believe that Kennedy's killing was the result of a conspiracy. Many think Oswald was framed, and some even think there were two or more guys answering to the name of Oswald.'JFK' has taken on an aura of 'fact' to so many that passions can be aroused if one voices a dissenting opinion in the wrong company. Not a lot of films have had the kind of impact. On the bonus side, the film JFK helped to get documents released which would have been kept from the public for 75 years after the assassination. These documents, a veritable mountain of them, are available to the public in varying degrees.In 1991 things seemed more black and white. Did I believe in a conspiracy then? It is hard to recall. Do I believe in one now? Yes. I believe that a conspiracy exists, on the Internet, in books and in the media, to present such an information overload that 'we' allow the 'experts' to feed us their Cliff Notes version of the 1963 events. They eat, digest, and we swallow.The web's minutia of everything Kennedy is mind boggling. Every point has a counterpoint. Every truth has a lie. Every ass gets to bray, and we are left to sort it out. You must make up your own mind on this movie and on the events that spawned it. For my part, the jury is still out. I tend to follow Occam's Razor, but research for this review has left me battered and reeling, and just as confused as anybody.",Null,1,11,19 November 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," MR takes itself too seriously to be fun.
","'The Matrix Reloaded' took itself entirely too seriously to be fun.When Neo did 'his superman thing', and derived no joy from it, I knew this film was going to collapse under its own weight. He should have flown up, hollered something ecstatic and then whooped on his way. Instead he acts as if flying is one more gritty chore he must endure.Then there is the attitude toward women. Link enters his abode hollering 'Where's my pussy'? and he is talking about his wife?! In most households I know of, Mr. Link would have been relegated to the doghouse until he learned some manners. Then the way that capt. says 'Niobe' as she talks to her former flame, Morpheus. It is in such a way that he is demanding she come to him... and she does! Are they telling us that in this hardscrabble future, where women risk their lives just as much as men, that the men are really only chauvinistic pigs? Well, no. White women fare better in the film, so I must conclude they are catering to prevailing stereotypes. (In this alternate universe there should be no notion of prejudice as a battery is a battery is a battery, regardless of outer casing.) Why does it always seem I'm the only reviewer who ever speaks up against violence toward women, nasty stereotypes and inappropriate behavior (in so-called children's films) that Hollywood keeps feeding us? The dialogue is ponderous; the love scene between Neo and Trinity fell surprisingly flat (no chemistry whatsoever!), and Morpheus' speech was too pompous for all the dancing that followed.The first Matrix film stood on its own two feet. This one can't because they gave it no 'mini-ending' to tide one over until the next film came along. The desire to milk more money from the viewing public (or to copy the Lord Of The Rings in its epic three picture deal, which is more believable when one realizes Hugo Weaving was in both trilogies.) is too obvious for taste.Will I see #3? I will, but not in the high dollar theatre... or even in the expensive 'one night rental' for new releases. No, I'll wait, just like I did for this one, until it goes into the bargain rental bin.",Null,0,0,12 December 2003
Tombstone," Is to Earp films what T-bone steak is to Steakums...
","'Tombstone' is a memorable film which is best viewed in the extended version. While most scenes restored in already released films are a gimmick to get you to part with more cash, the restored scenes in Tombstone should never have been cut in the first place, as they tie up loose ends which marred the original theatrical release, and kept it from true greatness.Then there is the other Wyatt Earp film of the season. (What was it with Costner? Wyatt Earp wasn't the first time he tried to beat a premised film to market. First there was the competing 'Robin Hoods' of 1991. Costner was so arrogant that he did not even attempt an English accent. Totally unwatchable rubbish.)Comparing Tombstone to Costner's 'Wyatt Earp' is like comparing fresh hens eggs to that powdered stuff the army serves up... you can roll Tombstone around in your mouth, exploring its every texture, or you can watch Costner play Costner while you gulp down the reconstituted mess, which, they tell you, 'is just as filling.' Yes, it will keep you alive, but something essential is missing. Length doth not an epic make.Tombstone has the epic feel. Tombstone has 'scope'. A finely choreographed testosterone slaughter-fest. Its dusty streets and wooden walks are brought to life in exquisite expectation, where Russell and Kilmer stride, larger than life, dueling and dwarfing worthy adversaries.There is a timeless feel to the film; a hyper-reality, which makes all other 'Earp' films pale in comparison.",Null,1,2,18 November 2003
