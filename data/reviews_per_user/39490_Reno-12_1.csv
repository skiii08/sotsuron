Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Better Every Time I Think About It!
","I told someone else that 'It was good when I was in the movie theatre, when I was walking back to my car it was really good, and when I got home I couldn't wait to see it again.' The special effects are... amazing. Naboo was so beautiful I wished I could live there, and Coruscant was an amazing image of what Earth will be in a thousand years or so (It will!) That's kind of a problem at the same time- I was so in awe at the FX that I kind of missed the MOVIE. I think that's what Lucas was going for- Now I have to go see it again. There wasn't a lot of action, but the main action scene was so amazing I wanted them to play it over again. I mean, DOUBLE SIDED LIGHTSABER. That's awesome.Ewan McGregor was an awesome Obi Wan, too, they couldn't have picked a better guy. And Natalie Portman was awesome.",9,0,0,22 May 1999
