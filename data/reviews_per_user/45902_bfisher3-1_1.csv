Walk the Line," It's no wonder Johnny had problems
","If the movie is anywhere near accurate, it's no wonder Johnny turned to drugs and alcohol. His father did nothing but torment him his entire life, and his first wife Vivian was a first class bitch. The only person who ever saw him for himself, was June Carter. I really enjoyed the actor who played Jerry Lee Lewis. You can't help but like the guy, even if he is a jerk! And my favorite scene was Johnny at Folsom Prison. I won't tell you what happens, but he sure let them know he related with his audience. I really enjoyed this movie, and with what I already knew about the 'Man In Black', this offers a personal glimpse into yet another famous person that leaves you with more respect and admiration than before. Walk The Line is worth seeing, and for me being a Cash fan, worth buying the DVD.",10,0,0,12 March 2006
