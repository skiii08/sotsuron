Skyfall," A new Bond!
","Craig is a new Bond.... And a much better Bond..... On top of course Sean... But right after him Craig.. Then Brosnan.... And then the rest.. With Moore at the bottom... At the three Bond-movies with Craig, Skyfall is the best And one thing I don't miss in the newer Bond-movies are the awful jokes... Of course the story is far-fetched. But what Bond-story isn't..... Right now I am reading Ian Flemings books, and I think that Skyfall fits very well into them.. am And I am quite sure that Cuppy Broccoli would have loved it.... Judy Dench is one of the finest castings... Is this her seventh appearance?...... Wow... It really is good for the later films that M are playing such an active part.. I have read some of the other reviews, and I cant understand how anybody could call Skyfall boring.....",9,1,6,17 May 2013
