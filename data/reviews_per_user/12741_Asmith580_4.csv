The Avengers," I think I know the problem.
","Before I review this title, I want to explain why there are so many bad reviews about this film. A lot of people don't know the back story of any of these superheroes, hydra, the tesseract (also known as the cosmic cube), Loki, or the avengers themselves. Joss did not have the time to explain all of this in pretty much expected people to already know about these things. That being said, for the people who are avid fans and know the story, you will love this movie. It is obvious that Joss is a fan of this series and loved making this movie. Everything in it screamed comic book Avengers. Even the Stan Lee inspired underlying theme of what it means to be a hero is prevalent when Iron Man learns that suits and power aren't what makes you a hero, but the willingness to act and sacrifice for others is what truly makes you a hero. I think a lot of people missed this, but this is what comic books are all about and that is why this film is magical. As for the CGI it was amazing and necessary in order to make this film. Wires would not have cut it in this case, no pun intended. This is the movie all of us geeks have been waiting for. Every character was spot on except for maybe Hawkeye and Fury, but I can overlook that. The small details were amazing, for example, the Hulk cannot lift Thor's hammer and Captain America never kills anyone with a gun (although he will use one to keep people at bay until he gets his shield back). This movie is important to comic book aficionados everywhere because we finally have one that was done right. Thanks Joss, screw the mainstream, this one is for us!",8,1,5,10 May 2012
Insidious," Wonderfully Scary, Delightful, and Fun
","Once upon a time there were scary movies. The problem was, they could not scare me. I tried everything, watching all sorts of movies, from classic horror to gory torture, but nothing worked. That is until I saw Insidious. For those of you who know horror, you will see how inspired this film really is. This is a true horror film that uses suspense and plot to lock the movie goer in. I appreciate that it was very well done and did not need to rely on gore and cheesy special effects to scare me. This movie had it all, weaving a plot that was original. You may hear some critics saying it was basically a combination of a bunch of other movies, but what movie isn't? Wan took a risk with talking about astral projection as the average person is not familiar with what this is. However, it worked perfectly for this movie and that is what sets it apart from the others. You can tell that this movie was very well thought out. This movie is suspenseful, visually stunning, terrifying, and pulls at the strings of spirituality. It is a classic masterpiece with a modern twist that will leave you begging for more. This is the first horror movie that I have enjoyed watching in a long time. Thank you Mr. Wan, my hat's off to you. And for all you skeptics out there, beware insidious.",9,7,13,3 April 2011
2012," 2012 â€“ An adult idea turned into a family movie doesn't work.
",".....Let's jump into the thick of it then. This movie was terrible. If you're going to make a movie about the end of the world, don't try and make it for families to go see. A movie like this should have blood, gore, trauma, real human emotion, painful sacrifice, love, loss, triumph, hope, and reflection of doing the right thing. You can tell that this movie attempted such things, but they went about it all wrong. All we get once again is action packed thrill ride scenes with absolutely no real and tangible emotion. I had the same problem with the new Indiana Jones. If there is no chemistry between your characters and the audience, then you have failed as a writer and as a movie maker. Thus this movie was an utter failure in my eyes. There is so much wrong with this movie, it isn't even funny. From the little things like knowing for a fact (being an ex-jet engine mechanic for the US Navy) that an engine would immediately stall if any amount of ash got inside and all your electronics would stop working if a volcano went off near you, to the big things like the directors attempt to make us care for all the evil billionaires who got to survive, but forget that the common man got screwed like usual. ***Spoiler Alert*** The ending of this movie was downright stupid. You expect me to believe the main characters got to the main land with a bunch of rich billionaire jerks and the people who let everyone die and live happily ever after. I don't think so, the writers of this movie obviously either thought about these things and didn't care, or were just a bunch of morons who didn't think about it. (I guess they could have just been lazy) This ending sums up the movie well with poorly thought out scenarios with a terrible story line masked by CGI effects all to make a crappy film for one reason only . . . to make money. I would love to remake this movie and rate it R, so I could capture what it would really be like if the world ended in 2012. So in short, if you're a mindless drone who doesn't care about cinema, plot development, or the character's on-screen chemistry; then go to this movie and enjoy, but if you are looking for more than overblown GGI effects and the mindless plot lines that we have come to expect from Hollywood these days, then by all means, go and see a good movie and scratch this one off your list.",2,4,5,3 December 2009
Rear Window," Films will come and films will go, but a classic can never be killed
","..We like to think that if a film is from a certain era, it is going to be slow and boring. I am writing to you as someone who previously owned this mindset. I really had to put my ADD aside when watching this film. It seems that I, like many of us, have grown accustomed to unpredictable plot twists with large explosions and clean special effects. If that is what you need to enjoy a film, then please look elsewhere; but if you enjoy great acting, suspense, and women who actual have curves; then this is the movie for you. I must say that Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly were magnificent. It is rare now days to find actors with such unique characteristics that made them an icon. The love between these two was very evident and I was glad to see Grace stick by her man through it all. This movie was filmed entirely on a single set which can make for a feeling of claustrophobia, but at the same time it allows you to relate to Jimmy Stewart's character as being confined inside his home with a broken leg. The beginning of this film was drawn out and took some real refocusing on my part to keep me moving along, but just as I was drifting off there would be a shot of a hot neighbor girl dancing in her 50s bikini to draw me back in. Once you get past the first 30 minutes or so, you really begin to feel for Stewart's character. You see the paranoia take hold as he begins to see the events of a possible murder unfold. You can feel his frustration when the people who are supposed trust him refuse to believe what he is saying. One scene that particularly stands out is when Grace Kelly's character enters the home of the killer to gather more evidence when she is caught and confronted by the killer. I was on the edge of my seat and felt almost as if I were the one watching helplessly as my future wife was manhandled by this brute. This movie is a roller-coaster of emotion and that is why it is a classic. Horror should give you the chills and good horror should freak you out, this does both. This is captured perfectly in the scene when the neighbor's dog is killed. The killer' room is dark and Stewart's character can see nothing, but he knows the killer is there. The suspense builds culminating in the strike of a match and the glimpse of the killer sitting alone is his room watching and waiting. There is so much this movie has to offer, it is fear on the simplest level and done very well. Hitchcock's use of shadow and cinematography is legendary and he holds nothing back in this wonderful film. Love him or hate him, this is a must see in the Hitchcock collection, granite you can get past the first 30 minutes or so.",8,0,2,4 December 2009
