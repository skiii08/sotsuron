The Rock," Best action movie of all time!!
",This movie is pure testosterone with a huge budget and non stop action. It's highly underrated in my opinion. Everything about the film is great from the awesome action sequences and stunts to the musical score. It is the perfect fun filled movie. The only flaw I can think of is that there weren't any central female characters but this movie was mainly designed for guys I guess. It wasn't designed to win any Oscars but just to provide movie fans with two exciting hours of mayhem and it did just that. Brilliant.,9,2,2,2 March 2002
American Pie," The Funniest movie of all time!!!!
","This movie had me in stitches all the way through. I went into the theater expecting just another crappy teen movie, but it turned out to be fantastic!! Too many classic scenes to mention. Just watch it and enjoy!The characters are so likeable and the situations and the outcomes are hilarious. Well written and more realistic than a lot of the trash out there. This movie is a must see. Classic!!!!!",10,0,1,27 March 2002
From Dusk Till Dawn," All out action with style
","There's something about Rodreguez that give his movies a stylish edge over other action flicks. This is no exception. Absolutely AWESOME!! I saw it on video which was a shame because it must have been even better in theatres. Still, I was blown away.",9,0,1,2 March 2002
Speed," Great!! Just what you need in an action movie!
","This is some serious 'edge of your seat' stuff. From start to finish it's all out action but not in the typical sense of the movie where you'd see shoot out after shoot out or explosion after explosion. Yet it still manages to keep your attention for the duration. Yet it was only made for about $30 million which isn't much compared to the standard action movie budget. It's all about tension and as well as that, the characters and performances are great too.",9,0,0,27 March 2002
