Requiem for a Dream," Perfect embodiment of drug use in the format of film.
","9.3Requiem For A Dream is a very powerful movie. It is powerful in more than one way. Both thematically, and artistically, the movie captures the correct atmosphere and mood of the subject matter. The pacing and editing also fit the theme well. Everything is seamed together in this movie, and nothing falls out of place.If you've ever taken drugs, especially heroine, but not limited to, you will immediately connect with Requiem For A Dream and its characters. It seems like Aronofsky and his crew tried to capture the essence of drug use into film format, while telling a story about the pitfalls and traps of drug use, whether it be for medical reasons, or for pleasure. They succeeded. What we have here is a movie that embodies the drug its tale is based upon. Like heroine, the user immediately feels pleasure once the substance is introduced to the bloodstream, the user is raised high into a state of euphoria. In the first half hour, the movie is mellow and pleasurable to watch, but not without its cringes. After a while, the effects start to dwindle. The drug drops you from your hedonistic height, and eventually the user is left feeling lower than sobriety. The climax of the movie leaves you feeling disturbed, if not disgusted, at the physical, psychological and even spiritual effects of drug use.Aronofsky and crew utilize quick cuts, multiple frames at once, and even odd camera positioning techniques to put you into the shoes of the characters, to help you feel their despair, and their euphoria as well. The pacing and the atmosphere in this film are some of the best that I've seen in film-making. I wouldn't say that the film is one of the greatest of all time, but it's definitely an achievement that solidified Aronofsky and Mansell as filmmakers in my eyes.",10,1,2,22 January 2010
Minority Report," Watching Minority Report is like having a precognition yourself; that of the future.
","9.3Leave it to the great minds to imagine the future. Leave it to the scientists to create the future. Leave it to the people to inhabit the future, and thus shape its cultures, its niches, and its memes. Minority Report is a film based on the Phillip K. Dick story by the same name. It takes place in 2054, and there is a division of police officers called Precrime who utilize special humans who have the foresight of future murders. The murders are stopped before they can occur, and thus there are no more murders being carried out. Minority Report takes place in a world very similar to ours, but much more technologically advanced.Everything from traffic that is operated without the need for human interference, advertisements that cater to your ears and use your name, and retinal recognition everywhere that we go. We also see advanced user interfaces and hologram projections. One thing that Minority Report does is that it peers into the future, but not too far. It is still grounded in our world, these are things that we can see in development right now. Google is currently working on cars that drive themselves. Microsoft, at the time of this writing, is about to release Kinect, a user interface that is similar to the one used by the Precrime officers. The vision of the movie and how it is carried out is stunning. It is a visual treat, and that of one for the imagination as well.The film itself is not amateurish in any sense, either. Steven Spielberg sits in the director's chair, but not in a lazy fashion. We see here the work of a man who knows what he's doing, and has known what he's doing for a long time now. The film has an interesting look, where everything is shiny and very, very bright. Sometimes the reflection of light on the lens is so strong, the light drowns the scene. This might turn some people off, but I think it gives the movie an interesting look. The entire thing feels like a dream sequence. Spielberg displays his mastery of translating emotion onto film and speakers, with some scenes that will have you choking as you try to swallow them. There is a scene in the movie that is of my favorite scenes in film. The protagonist stands while a female character puts her head on his shoulder. They are both conversing, and you can only see both of their heads in the shot. The lighting is perfect, and you can tell that a lot of thought was put into this shot. Thank you, God, for art. Thank you, mankind, for cinema.The performances in Minority Report are also very good. Tom Cruise is a good actor, and delivers all of these scenes with conviction. Most of the other actors keep up with him, some delivering as fine of a performance. The music is done by John Williams. Mr. Williams has worked with Spielberg many times before, and his music is pretty recognizable. However, I heard many things here that I don't think I've heard before in a John Williams score. The story is loosely based on the novel, and its twists, turns and conclusion will have you invested and entertained all throughout the film. The film does inspire emotion, even if it is shock, and you might feel yourself a bit drained of emotion by the end of it. This is, of course, the sign of a good film. But just because you can play an instrument beautifully doesn't mean that you should fill the air with constant notes, the audience will become tired of it.I've said it before: it's easy to nitpick a great piece of art. Just as easy as it is to write about bad art. Minority Report is a great film. It's not done by amateurs in any sense of the word, and the reference material (although I haven't read it myself) is very good. Some will be turned off by the sci-fi feel and the plasticky, metal, electronic look. But those who are into science fiction are in for a real treat, because besides delivering a solid and original science fiction movie, it's also a successful movie in terms of execution of assets and inspiration of emotion. Watching Minority Report is like having a precognition yourself; that of the future.",9,0,1,13 October 2010
Akira," Akira is a very beautiful flower, despite the thorny stem.
","9.4Why do we like films? Why do we like moving pictures? Is it just a form of storytelling? It surely is. In fact, it's a very good form of storytelling. But is there more to film? Are more traditional forms of art, such as drawings, paintings and sculptures storytelling? Is music more than storytelling? What about books?I believe that there is more to film than storytelling. Saying that film is about storytelling is like saying that music is about the lyrics. There is a lot of fine music out there that has poor, or even no lyrics. In fact, one might argue that opera is more than storytelling. That doesn't sound far-fetched, right? The question is, does film relate to books more than it does to music and paintings?It may be difficult to make a film without a story. It would probably end up being described as, 'abstract'. This might be because it is hard for the audience to find rapport with the film. I find it limiting to the art of film for people to see storytelling as a crutch, or necessary foundation. However, it is easy to see that storytelling is commonly seen that way in film. Whereas music is divided into genres of tone and style, film is divided into genres of content and narrative. There is an aspect to film that is what makes it the medium, platform or canvas for artistic expression that it is. It is on this ground that I personally try plant my expectations and critiques when I watch a film. Anything else is complimentary.Akira is a 1988, animated adult film. I say adult because in the West, animation is usually associated with children. Akira is definitely not for children. The story is based on a 2,182 page manga. It is a science-fiction, heavy story. Turning this into a 2 hour film should have been difficult. What is left feels like a very compressed script. There is little room for the audience to develop a relationship with the characters. I have seen this film about 4 times. The first time I saw it, I was intrigued at the plot at first, but lost interest about halfway through, and had no idea what was going on by the end of it. The fourth time I saw the film (on Blu-Ray), I payed lots of attention, and I still found it to be obscure and compressed. This makes the film drag during certain scenes. I usually don't experience this 'drag' emotion that people talk about when discussing movies, but I can definitely testify that Akira, if any film I've ever seen, drags. This is ultimately what separates those who fell in love Akira and those who absolutely hated it.But like I said earlier, I believe that storytelling in film is just a stem for what ultimately leads to a flower. (And if you think that a story can be so good that it doesn't matter if the flower is ugly, you should have written a book.) Akira is a very beautiful (in a gritty sense) flower. The animation is very impressive for its time. I don't like to compare works of art, but in 1988, Disney released Oliver & Company and in 1989, The Little Mermaid. These two films, while not mediocre in terms of animation, pale in comparison to what is found in Akira. The depiction of dynamic lighting and shadows looks very natural in Akira, and it is almost a blessing to see animators paying much attention to these things. There is a scene where you can see the trails of light that a motorcycle leaves behind, mimicking the effect that is seen when using actual film. What else is impressive is the extensive use of smoke. There are a lot of explosions in Akira, and every explosion either has a large explosion or little pockets of smoke that animate very realistically. If you don't believe me, go and compare the other works of animation that came out at the time. While this may sound like it is a purely technical aspect, its result for me when watching the film was that it elevated the animation to an almost transparent level, where it was no longer a cartoon and now a near real event. The backgrounds of Neo-Tokyo are also very nicely depicted, and drawn. Another aspect of Akira that greatly exceeded my expectations was the music. The original soundtrack uses sounds that I'm not too familiar with, call it maybe a cultural difference. Still, I would have never imagined the music to have sounded the way it did. The use of percussion and... well... screaming paints a image of Neo-Tokyo that is rivaled by the work done in Blade Runner. (Which Akira is heavily influenced by.)Akira is ultimately a very clear definition of a love/hate piece. The compressed, obscure plot and unfamiliarity with the sounds and sights, especially it's depiction of postmodern industrial Japan, may confuse, literally, audiences. Or, you may be drawn in by the animation, enchanted by the music, intrigued by the science fiction plot early on, and come out of it satisfied. Overall, whichever side of the theater you are in, it is definitely a must-see for animation buffs, and a recommendation for film lovers. Simply put, some people might not be able to hear the music (figuratively speaking) in Akira, and only hear the lyrics, which appears to be incoherent. To answer the question posed earlier, film does not relate to books, paintings and music. Although they are derived by human hands, the aesthetics that belong to them are unique. Akira is a very beautiful flower, despite the thorny stem.",9,1,4,13 May 2010
Iron Man 2," More entertainment than merit, only hindered by an unfocused script.
","7.7Sometimes I like to think that we are in a digital Renaissance. Consider the advances that we made during the Renaissance. Perspectives in paintings, improvements in architecture, and an overall advance in education. Consider now the industrial revolution. Machinery eventually led to electronics, and eventually the increase of reliance on computer systems and the jump from analog technology to digital technology as well. Computer electronics can be programmed to serve virtually limitless functions. Our world today is a proof itself that not only is it efficient, but very welcomed by almost all humans.When people advance, so do their military forces. In fact, a lot of the time, a nation's military seeks to secure technology, so as to keep the enemy, or other nations, from gaining and utilizing it as well. This is probably the most realistic aspect of Iron Man 2. The rest is, well, a superhero movie. However, there is one thing about Iron Man that differentiates him from (most) other superheroes: his powers are purely technology based. This leads me to believe that the 'Iron Man' is a possible reality, some day in the future.The film and franchise's hero is Tony Stark, a young billionaire and genius inventor. The superhero is Iron Man, who is basically Stark in a cyber-suit of sorts. However, I'd like to think that the Iron Man aspect of Tony Stark is more plausible than the Stark part of him. A 21-year old billionaire/genius inventor is a superhero. It is something that does not exist in our world. In fact, to whom can you compare Stark to? Da Vinci? Well, I'm not an expert on this, but I don't think Da Vinci was as rich as Stark was. Nor probably was he as promiscuous as Stark was. Da Vinci was said to be a generous person, who practiced humility. Stark is seen by many as, like one character in the film labeled him as, 'a prick.' Stark and Da Vinci have one major thing in common: they are both genius inventors. So in this age, that I like to call the dawn of the Digital Renaissance, Stark does not exist. He does not take place yet in our world. But neither does Iron Man. The question is, which will come first? But that's enough foreshadowing. I went into Iron Man 2 with little expectation, just as the first film. The first film really impressed me. I wasn't expecting much out of the superhero flick, especially after having seen some other very good ones. Iron Man 2, sadly, fails to deliver like the original did. However, it is by no means a failure. In fact, it is a pleasure to revisit this take on the Iron Man universe. While there is no wrong in taking a moment to breathe in the air, business needs to be done. Where does Iron Man stand? Who (or what) is the villain? There are multiple villains/threats to Iron Man in this movie. There's Whiplash (one of the greatest villains in comic book films), Hammer, the U.S. government, and palladium. While I was expecting the weakness of the film to lie in it's use of so many villains, it was the lack of focusing on the biggest threat that was its biggest flaw.Not only is Whiplash's part downplayed, but so are many other characters' as well. Black Widow, and her other identities, barely has no weighty dialogue in the film. It seems like everything she said was to add to somebody else's comments, or was simply lost in all the action going on around her. The only new character whose part wasn't toned down was Hammer. I guess that ultimately that's what happens when you focus on so many villains at once, but I really think that the film should have centered on Whiplash, given that not only was he a good villain story-wise, but Mickey Rourke's performance and portrayal of the character was excellent.Iron Man 2 is a film that seems to be comfortable being exactly what is. The first time around, it seems like they worked hard to make a good film, not just an entertaining film, and succeeded in doing so. This time, it seems like they went more for an entertainment route, rather than, 'we can make a good superhero film'. While there's nothing wrong with that, I still feel that business needs to get done, and there was a huge opportunity missed with Whiplash and Mickey Rourke in this film. Still, Iron Man 2 sports good direction, good performances, and is only hindered by an unfocused script. If it was entertainment that they sought, it is entertainment that they delivered.",Null,0,1,9 May 2010
500 Days of Summer," A larger dose of realism with your everyday 'chick flick'.
","8.5'It's these cards and the movies and the pop songs, they're to blame for all lies and the heartache, everything.' There are many love stories and so called 'chick flicks' out there. There are just as many romance novels and soap operas. One thing in common with all these works is that, the common theme, love, is discovered, lost, and then regained, usually with the same person, or 'the right person'. This is essential to story telling, given that it is all fictional work, used for self reflection. Audiences will feel some form of regret spending their time and investing their emotions into the film, or whatever it may be, if the ending falls short and the protagonist (or group of them) do not triumph in the end. In this genre, the villain is loneliness, or lack of love.(500) Days of Summer is not too different from the other works in its genre. However, it tries to be, and does succeed in doing so. The film constantly brings up, like the aforementioned quote, that these films or whatever it may be paint a pretty picture of the real experience of love and relationships. Usually, you expect for there to be a good ending, where the protagonist, like a child, is comforted. There is nothing wrong with expecting a positive conclusion in life. However, a relationship involving young people usually does not last a lifetime. And the realistic conclusion, is that one should not expect everything to return to their former ways, but one should accept the changes and gather experience from it. There is a scene in the film where the expectations of the young man and the reality of the situation is contrasted side by side. It is basically the context of the entire film. It knows its role as a film about love, and tries to offer you more realism.This is director Marc Webb's first full length film. I didn't know this, and wouldn't have guessed it while watching the film. He is definitely one to keep an eye on, as he displays some talent in (500) Days of Summer. The story is told from the perspective of the man. Though the film jumps back and forth through time very often and too quickly for my taste, it still manages to maintain the right energy between the jumps, and you can always tell a huge difference between the different time periods in the life of the relationship. Just as the graphic preceding the time jumps show the concept of seasons, with a tree blooming and its leaves shrinking and losing color, you can just as well tell the difference in the environments, faces and emotions of the actors (mainly the protagonist). Light narration is needed, as everyone does their job in telling the story. I wouldn't say that the film is near-perfect in any sense of the term in its ability to output the emotions of the characters, but it is in no way mediocre either.It's true, there are many clichés in (500) Days of Summer. Most of the plot, and the events and characters in it you've probably all ready seen before, especially if you're fond of the genre. However, chances are there's a reason why you keep coming back to the genre, and I am happy to announce that (500) Days of Summer offers a fresh enough perspective on it that you will enjoy. The movie tries to be different. It tries to offer you a larger dose of reality to go with your 'chick flick', 'love story' fix. And it manages to do so, with style, too. It's also worth mentioning, like the movie does, that this is a modern film. The characters belong in contemporary settings. Ultimately, I'd recommend this film first of all if you're looking to find new and promising directors. But to summarize the film, I will quote it itself, when it said, 'This is not a love story. It is a story about love.'",9,0,1,15 March 2010
The Town," The Town is definitely worth visiting.
","8.7Does social and economic inequity affect crime rates? It probably does. The question is, why do these men and women stay involved in this lifestyle? When your loved ones are at risk, even if they are at risk simply because you are in danger of being imprisoned, why do you continue? Is it because a regular job just isn't enough? Is it because we all, secretly inside, want to be rich celebrities? You only get one life in this world, so why waste it in poverty? That's better than wasting it in prison, but is the risk worth it?The Town is your typical crime flick. It's got a romantic anchor, and the ending isn't the most original ending I've seen in this genre. But as traditional as it might be, and for everything that it sets out to do, it does it right. It's not the best of its kind, but it's certainly one of the better films of its kind. The movie manages to keep you interested right from the get-go, all the way to the credits.The movie has a great atmosphere, and most of this is due to the performances, more than anything else. I've never been in Boston, but now I felt like I have. I'm not even sure if some of these actors have ever lived in Boston, either. Their performance allows you to level with them, even though they are criminals. This is the type of movie where you are subconsciously (or even consciously) rooting for the bad guys. The movie rarely relies on Charlestown's scenery, and goes for its denizens to paint a picture of the old settlement.The Town is a great movie, but doesn't really bring anything new to the table. Not that it has to, by the way. It's a movie that casual movie goers will enjoy, especially with its traditional ending. However, it's ability to capture your attention (and emotions) from the intro of the film all the way to the end deserves to be acknowledged. It has pretty good dialogue between the characters, but it's the bold performances that will stand out. The Town is definitely worth visiting.",9,1,5,2 October 2010
Shutter Island," Bold around the edges, Scorsese paints another fine picture.
","8.9Shutter Island is the first Scorsese film that I've seen in theaters. It may be hard to believe, but it's true. I would describe seeing a Scorsese film as a bold experience. Shutter Island is such an experience, but only around the corners. With that said, it's still a very good painting. Even though there are some objects in the painting that may not be as good, there are other objects that are great, and the overall tone of the painting is very good. The atmosphere in the film is top-notch. The music and sounds serve this purpose very well, also. The haunting, yet beautiful strings match the also haunting, yet beautiful scenery very well. The film also uses weather to set the mood. The setting had a stormy tone, a dark and violent mood, to fit the characters on the island. The final shot of the film is one of my favorite shots out of any film, ever.So far that's the overall tone, and some of the greater objects in the painting. But there are elements to the painting that are not so great. This is namely some parts of the film towards the middle that don't have much of the boldness discussed earlier. Some scenes don't come off with the same grace, and some dialogue heavy scenes don't really do a very good job of painting the whole twilight zone, psychological thriller theme. It feels a bit dry, or weak, whereas some key scenes in the film are... wet.Shutter Island is a story that needs peeling. There's more to it, there's a twist. The problem is, not only is the twist poorly veiled, but it was ruined for me and some friends during the trailer. This has nothing to do with the movie, but it's worth mentioning because it affected the movie watching experience in the end. The trailer presents the plot/problem, and hints the solution to the point where you want to experience that type of film, but when you finally do, it won't be as good, because it was all ready ruined. It's like marrying a woman who lost her virginity a long time ago. Even then, the ending is great, and left some viewers with a feeling of ambiguity. When seen from that point of view, it is a very good film. When seen from the traditional perspective, the ending still delivers.I greatly enjoyed Shutter Island. I loved being on the island, and I never wanted to leave. I never wanted Teddy to leave, either. It can be described almost as a lasagna. There's a lot of pasta, but those other components are so good that so me of them end up being amongst my favorite and most powerful scenes in cinema. Shutter Island will welcome you with open arms, make you feel at home. Then suddenly creep you out as you realize that it's maybe not as great a place as you initially thought it was. But you will be glad you payed a visit. And after all, Scorsese's paint strokes transform this film from mediocre to great.",9,1,6,21 February 2010
Tropic Thunder," Dumb gags, over-the-top violence, and a straight shot into Hollywood's heart.
","7.5When I was in my early teens, I was fond of war movies. I would watch any war film I could get my hands on. I couldn't get enough of it. It didn't matter how old they were, or in what setting the films took place in. Just as long as I could get my adrenaline fix. I enjoyed the atmosphere. Twentieth century Europe and Asia all looked vaguely familiar. Perhaps because I have seen it portrayed so many times. But it wasn't until the fireworks show started that things got interesting. As soon as the combat began, as soon as the shells started to land, the grenades started to go off, the rounds were fired, that's when I knew I was watching a war film. And they were really all the same film. Sort of like episodes of the same drama. They took place in different locations and times, and the opposing sides were often switched around, but it was the same thing every time. Men in conflict using (usually) ballistics and explosives to suppress each other. But, why was it so appealing to me at that age? I felt empathy and sympathy towards the characters, both people and groups of people, such as nations. However, I also really wanted to see them blow each other up. I knew that it was fake, and I also knew that I never really wanted to see something like that in real life. Or did I? Maybe I just didn't want to see it happen to someone I knew. The matter is, Hollywood is permeated with war movies. People of all ages (especially younger ages, I believe) are attracted to these films. After seeing so much violence, one becomes immune to it. He no longer feels any empathy, and soon loses even sympathy. He does not really lose the excitement anymore, but it is toned down. He might start to feel like the violence is fun, or even funny. And in order to gain the former level of excitement, the violence needs to be toned up. Until that reaches the extent of its power.Cue Tropic Thunder. Ben Stiller, who directed, produced, co-wrote and starred in the lead role, first found the idea for Tropic Thunder while working on Empire Of The Sun, which was released in 1987. He found it funny how actors and artists like to portray war in movies, but that they will probably never understand what true war and combat is like. Tropic Thunder is exactly that. A parody of Hollywood itself, specifically in terms of war movies. In this aspect, it excels. It is funny, yes. Is it violent? Very. Does it successfully paint a picture of Hollywood and its obsession with violent spectacles and combat? I think so. The cinematography in the film is excellent. It looks, sounds and feels like a true war film. It might even be mistaken for one.However, it's worth nothing that Tropic Thunder is good, but not great. Yeah, I know, anyone can sit here and say that about anybody's hard work. And I admire the hard work of all people involved in film-making. The camera sometimes turns around on the crew itself and films the actual crew of Tropic Thunder, who is supposed to be filming 'Tropic Thunder', the film that is being filmed in the movie. This is only mildly ridiculous compared to some things in the movie. Tropic Thunder's plot is very predictable. What you expect this movie to offer you is probably very close to what it actually does offer. It has dumb gags, over-the-top violence, and a straight shot into the heart of Hollywood. One thing that disappointed me and kept me far away from the film for two years, and also managed to get me to skip the theatrical release, was that the film takes the violent jokes too far. In my taste, probably because I have become so conditioned by my early teen years that what I should be feeling towards the portrayal of war in any medium is empathy and sympathy, it is taken too far. I saw the unrated version, where they take it just a little bit further, apparently. It was a turn off for me, and I really didn't find myself laughing until later on in the movie. This is very important if you are the type of person that is affected by the realistic (in terms of special effects) portrayal of violence and war.Tropic Thunder is a good movie. It is also a funny movie. However, it has it's shortcomings. It takes the violence a bit too far for some people's tastes. Adding in fart jokes and jokes about retarded people doesn't help either. However, it manages to retain some charm, and deliver at least a laugh or two. In my opinion, the film is at its best when Speedman's agent finds himself in a dilemma as to whether remain faithful to his actor, or sell him out for undeserved riches. That is what I had hoped Tropic Thunder would be, but I guess they just wanted to have fun with this one. But that's alright, and so is Tropic Thunder, considering my expectations of it. It's alright. (Note: The cinematography work done by John Toll is exceptional.)",8,0,1,9 April 2010
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," A movie for my generation.
","8.4The relationship between video games and movies is undeniable. Obviously, video games were originally inspired by movies. However, after video games' inception into our world, movies began to be inspired by them. You can easily find its inspiration in the films that are being developed today. There is a new generation of audiences, and thus a generational gap between film critics and today's movies.It is almost written in stone that a movie based on a video game will be terrible, and that a video game based on a movie will be mediocre at best. This might be because most of these products are just that: products. There is little to no love being poured into it. It may just be produced by people who's main incentive towards the project is financial compensation. The best video game movie ever made is Scott Pilgrim. It is a movie that is not based on a video game at all, though. It is based on a comic book that is heavily influenced by video game culture. So maybe Scott Pilgrim doesn't exactly qualify for this category. Either way, it's a movie made for those who love video games, and it's great.Edgar Wright helms the directors chair and shows us that he understands my generation. Thanks, Wright. The editing is Scott Pilgrim is superb. The movie likes to use multiple camera angles on-screen at the same time. It also likes to put words and images on screen, such as onomatopoeias and symbols like lightning and even a pixeltated version of Scott's face, representing an extra life. All this works to the film's advantage, creating a style that's not exactly unique, but is used in a unique way.The narrative in Scott Pilgrim is strongly targeted towards the 18-24 age group. Scott's experience with women, and life itself, is limited. However, he learns in the movie, and thus, the audience is presented with the opportunity to learn as well. However, if you are well above that age group, you might find Scott Pilgrim to be quite tedious. You usually get a more mature, experienced take on the situations presented in this movie. But in Scott Pilgrim, you let a goofy 22 year old take the wheel.Scott Pilgrim is a great movie, but it is obvious to see the generation gap between its target audience and older viewers. If you are Scott Pilgrim's age, you must see it. If you aren't, you will probably find it to be a mix of cute and annoying, like children usually are. Scott Pilgrim gets away with what movies based on video games wish they could pull off: using actual references to video games in the movie. I don't know how much they payed for the Zelda music, but it was well worth it. Thank you Scott Pilgrim crew, for making a movie for my generation. Well, at least the nerdy/geeky side of it, anyway.",8,3,12,24 August 2010
Kick-Ass," Not quite what I was expecting, but still an entertaining movie.
","7.5I don't like superhero movies. In fact, I don't like superheroes very much at all. I can't quite understand what it is exactly about superheroes that makes people my age so attracted to them. I think it's a juvenile fantasy, and it looks dumb. Little kids fantasize about having unique super powers, and having great strength. Spiderman even babies us, and tells us, 'yeah, you can have all that power, but you need to use it responsibly.'Here comes Kick-Ass, a superhero movie that is not about superheroes, but rather, normal people who aspire to be superheroes. In premise, it sounds interesting. However, the final product becomes an unrealistic and over the top excuse for slapstick. In fact, the interactions between the main characters in Kick-Ass are pretty juvenile, and it's pretty clear this movie is aimed for tweens. The villain is a rich mobster who takes his anger out on superheroes who seem to be dedicated to ruining his vile business. The main character, Kick-Ass, acts like a child most of the time and his interaction with Red Mist, who is actually the mobster's son, is like watching teenagers interact awkwardly. OK, maybe there's nothing wrong with a movie for youth, but if you were expecting more, this is what you're getting instead.Kick-Ass's main hook is that the so-called 'superheroes' do not actually have any super powers. Unfortunately, they either have an incredible ability for martial arts, a knack for avoiding death, or shrugging off fatal injury. If you ask me, those are pretty good super powers. The movie loses its ground to reality when the little girl is flipping around the room dismembering adults (armed ones) with her weapons. I was expecting Kick-Ass to be sort of like the original Watchmen graphic novel, and explore what human discipline and willpower can achieve. However, it's just a shallow comedy.The filmmaking in Kick-Ass isn't bad, but it also isn't anything special. The film is obviously professionally done, but then there are those typical camera angles. Sure, it's nice to be able to comfortably take in what's on the screen, but there's so much more that can be done with a camera. And there's also so much more that could have been done with the film's idea.I hate to knock on a film for being either bad or mediocre. I appreciate all films and I hope that the experience of creating one serves as an aid to the abilities of those involved. Kick-Ass will entertain young audiences, especially those who love comic books and superheroes. But for those that were hoping for something more, do not expect a lot, for fear that you will be disappointed like I was. I hate to succumb to peer hype, but unfortunately Kick-Ass is a victim of this. Or am I the victim, because I didn't enjoy Kick-Ass as much as everyone else did? Either way, if I sound like a jerk, you'll probably enjoy Kick-Ass.",7,1,4,18 August 2010
The Hurt Locker," It's like fast food restaurants asking you to be healthy. But it's good.
","9.1What kind of movies do you like, and why do you like them? Why do you like movies at all? Do they offer escape, adrenaline, humor, arousal, self-reflection, or intrigue? Is it an aesthetic pursuit? Which of these does The Hurt Locker offer? If escape, then you would escape into war, which you might expect people would want to escape from. It offers it's fair share of adrenaline. Enough to not dull the effect. It offers a little humor, enough to ease the tension. It offers self-reflection, mostly in men, but not limited to. It also appeals to women who ponder and consider the military, as well as combat-like scenarios, including violence. Now, the last, and most important one: intrigue. Does The Hurt Locker make you feel intrigue? Does it make you feel interested in the settings and scenarios depicted? If the answer is 'yes', the real question (which is the entire purpose of the film), is 'why'?This is what The Hurt Locker asks you as a film. Why are you attracted to violent spectacles? To combat? It's a very good question. And the interesting thing is, The Hurt Locker also does a very good job of delivering that adrenaline and intrigue of violence that you (may) crave. It's an almost unavoidable paradox. In order to avoid this, they would have had to have no violence, no action, no explosions in the film. It would have been a commercial failure. But hey, it was pretty indie/'limited' to begin with. If it was given a wide release in theaters, it would have been commercially successful. I am sure of it. Why? Well, because it seems like a movie where people can pay the ticket price and receive their compensation of adrenaline and action. The very thing that the movie is questioning you about. It's like when fast-food restaurants try to get you to think nutrition and eat healthy.But The Hurt Locker is not a failure. In the aesthetic sense, it delivers. Its setting and plot require no specifics. No name-dropping. You, as the contemporary audience, know where it takes place, and why. War. That's all you need to know. There is an atmosphere of hostility, with low visibility and a near monotone color scheme. The only standout colors are blue skies and red blood. The shots are paced slow when they need to be, allowing rest from the tenser scenes, but still maintaining suspense at times. The adrenaline packed scenes are much faster, with quick cuts and swinging cameras. The tension builds up like a bomb. Usually, the bomb is defused. But sometimes, it goes off.The film also does a good job of portraying its characters. The characters being, of course, the young men and women who enlist in the military and experience combat. At one point, a character, stuck in a foxhole like ditch, is drinking some juice. He appears to be sucking on it like a warm bottle of milk, as if delivered straight from mother. The character becomes aware of danger, tosses the juice aside, and grabs his weapon, or rifle, which we can assume his father handed him (metaphorically, of course). The character then beings to defend himself. But not without hesitating and experiencing fear. He did more in conquering that fear than if he would have just simply acted out of the influence of adrenaline. One thing I want to add, is that the pacing in this scene, as well as others of the better moments of the film, are excellent.The Hurt Locker is a good war film. By that I mean two things. One, it's a good film about war. And two, more importantly, it's a good war film. It makes you question why you are intrigued by war and violent spectacles (if you are). Just as the characters in the film find themselves questioning why they do the things they do, you might find yourself questioning why you wanted to see The Hurt Locker. If you didn't, then your answer is very simple: adrenaline rolled up in action. And just like the beginning quote of the film says, '...war is a drug.'",9,1,5,25 February 2010
Toy Story," If it wasn't for Toy Story coming together so well, computer animation would have taken a step backwards.
","9.4For years, Disney reigned as the superior animation studio. Although there were others creating animated feature length films, Disney has always been a household name, known for their experience and ability to create an emotional and entertaining experience out of hand-drawn images, and original, composed music. In 1995, Pixar Animation Studios released Toy Story. While it wasn't the first time that we've seen CGI, or Computer Generated Imagery, it was the first fully CGI film.What a disaster this film could have been. And thank God that it wasn't. If it was, then it would have done more damage to CGI animation than otherwise. The film was distributed by Disney, but created by Pixar. It had no musicals. No frames were hand drawn, everything was done by computer. It had a lot to live up to. Sticking the Disney name on the film meant that audiences expected not a single drop of mediocrity out of it. Thankfully, as we all know, Toy Story was a success.The animation in the film isn't the augmented reality kind. CGI effects aren't added to real life shots, everything is animated. This gives the film some room to breathe. The lighting, surfaces and other effects all look good, in their own context. It would have been a huge step backwards for computer animation if Toy Story didn't come together so well, and successfully put up that fourth wall.But besides the animation, what brings to film to life is the voice- acting, story, and presentation. It's a story about toys who are conscious and self-aware. However, they all follow a strict code, where they do not allow humans to know of their life and intelligence. It's not an epic tale. Two toys are lost and have to get back home. But what carries the film are the characters. Every toy has a distinct personality, and the voice actors are great in their roles. This is one of the strong points in Toy Story.The film's presentation is great, too. It went totally contradictory of what Disney means to people. There are no musicals, but the music, although used sparingly, has a great effect nonetheless. The direction is of the more typical Hollywood style, and different from the typical Disney movie. It is entertaining to exist in the toys' world, and when they venture off a couple of blocks, you feel like you have traveled a long distance. Toy Story could have been such a disaster. If it wasn't for everything coming together so well, especially the animation, characters and voice acting, computer animation would have taken a step backwards. Its greatest strength are the toys. They are amongst the better characters in film. Toy Story not only proved that animated films can be done in a different formula than the already great Disney one, but that computer animation was here to stay. It was a pleasure to the eyes, and a pleasure to the Andy inside all of us.",9,0,0,5 July 2010
Alice in Wonderland," The film falls flat on its stomach as soon as Alice does herself.
","6.5There's a truth in life that everyone sees things differently. Different environments, different lots, and different biologies make (although not really accounted to these factors) different people. Other things, such as sex and age make for a different perspective in a person. A child, a teenager, an adult, and an older person view the world respectively. Certain things such as love, violence, personalities, fear, and all kinds of other things in life are responded to and perceived differently by people of different ages. Some people tend to favor the abstract side of things. You may argue that children often tend to follow this trend.It may have been with this in mind that Lewis Carroll penned Alice's Adventures In Wonderland in 1865. Children, I believe (at least I can say this about my own childhood), have an interesting take on life. Certain personalities can be transformed into exaggerated characters. Certain attributes as well can be exaggerated. Something that is large can appear to be immense. Just as well as something that is tiny can appear to be the smallest thing possible. The characters in Wonderland, of which the book is focused on, rather than the setting itself, may be representatives of Alice's real word associates. In the Tim Burton film, we see at the end of it that Alice relates some persons to their Wonderland counterparts. The original work, including the Disney animated film are great. Every scene, or character, is memorable and well depicted.The same cannot be said about the 2010 film. While the characters aren't bad, they are certainly not memorable. Ask anyone who has seen the Burton film. What is the caterpillar's traits? What is he like? Who is he? If you've only seen the Burton film, chances are you're going to have some trouble in describing this character. So, such as it is, arguably the greatest strength of the Alice In Wonderland series is where the Burton film comes short. I have no ultimately negative criticisms on the director, nor the cast and crew who worked on this film. They all did their jobs (while some of the performances/jobs done were more memorable than others), but in the end the film does not deliver on the film front nor on the Alice In Wonderland front.The other major flaw of the film is the plot. While not sticking to the original, they opted to go for more of a sequel format. What results is not the greatest or even at least remotely exciting sub plot ever for the universe. But again, this isn't the problem. The problem is the execution. A final battle results in a dull environment that exhibits almost amateurish film-making. Once again, I respect Burton, the cast, and the crew, but I was very disappointed with this film.In the end, the movie has some success. It is only really half bad, but it could have been so good. As a fan of the book and original animated film, I was interested in this film. The live action take on the characters in Wonderland (especially The Queen) is great. I can't say the same about the environments. It starts off good, but soon falls flat on its stomach about as hard and as fast as Alice herself does in the beginning, and it also happens to do so at exactly that point. The 3D technology used in the film didn't bring much to the table. There is really not much to recommend here, but don't dismiss it as it is not a total failure. Just a slight disappointment when living up to the formula of combining the previous Alice In Wonderland works and the works of the cast and crew in the film.",6,1,2,3 May 2010
Zombieland," Much like scoring a Twinkie in real life.
","7.5I'm not a big fan of zombies. I went into Zombieland in want of and expecting a good movie. I heard it was a good movie. I was disappointed. But that doesn't make it a bad movie. In fact, I'd say that it is an 'above mediocre' film. There's a good premise, a good cast, and a newcomer director that didn't get to show off much with this script. The script lacks. There are some funny, witty and good lines. But there's a lot of fluff. There's a lot of filler. And filler isn't really all that good. In fact, watching Zombieland is much like eating a Twinkie.It has good characters, and a great cast. However, there isn't much room for them to move around, or you know, be characters. You never really feel like there's a connection between them. And I don't think this is because of the actors' performances, I think it's because of the script. The world as well, feels dead. And I don't mean the zombie type of dead, I mean the 'where are we, and where are we going' type of dead. The only place in the film that is interesting is... well... a certain character's mansion. The film is very short, and I think with a bit more development, showing more time on the road, more locations for them to encounter zombies and escape, would make for a better overall film. Instead of the, 'here we are, here are the characters, here are a few jokes, and we're done', setup that we get. It felt as if the movie was afraid to do more.If you're going to make a zombie movie, and all it's really about is survival, and you choose to not elaborate on the origin of the plague, you have to have a lot of style. A lot of character. And this movie has that, at first. For example, Tallahassee's Twinkie infatuation. What seems to be like a good thread in the story, one that invites all kinds of possible situations and jokes, one that can promote suspense and emotion in the audience, while being a funny concept at the same time, fails to deliver. There isn't much mention of the Twinkie infatuation. It takes a back seat to... to... well... nothing. Nothing as nearly as interesting happens in the movie, with the exception of the aforementioned mansion scene. In the end the conclusion to the Twinkie thread isn't even all that satisfying. It's much like trying to score a Twinkie in real life, trust me.Zombieland has a good start. It introduces an interesting universe for zombies in America, introduces good characters (casted well, to boot), starts good threads, but then falls asleep. If you like zombies, and/or you're looking for a fun and simple movie to watch, go no further. However, if you're looking for a good film that happens to be about zombies, do not expect much. This movie is nothing special, but it doesn't have to be, and it's not bad either. However, it's a bit disappointing because it seemed like it was going to be a really good film about zombies.",7,0,0,24 February 2010
Inception," The sights and sounds in this film must be experienced. It is a beacon to a new age of filmmaking.
","9.6Movies are changing. From Chaplin, to Welles, to Kubrick, to Christopher Nolan, movies have changed. There are tons of great directors and filmmakers making movies out there right now. Whether it be for mere profit, where production studios hire filmmakers to produce sequels for franchises and universes that will bring sales, or whether it be for pure artistic expression, filmmakers are changing the medium one step at a time.Sadly, it seems that most of the films that are made just to earn money are the ones who are financially backed up well. There are tons of great ideas out there that never leave people's heads. Some of them do, but are poorly backed up and never quite match up to the original vision. However, every now and then, a studio gives a filmmaker who has proved himself a chance to make an original work, and gives them the necessary resources that they might need. Inception is such a film. Coming from the minds of the Nolan brothers, and in the works for about a decade, Inception has finally been made. The dream has become reality. And it was well worth every penny and every second of work put into it.The film is about dreams and has a surrealistic feel to it. You are never really supposed to know whether the setting of the current scene takes place in reality, or in a dream. The movie itself is like a dream. The movie begins with the protagonist waking up on a beach, with the water hitting his face. As soon as Inception begins, so does the dream. The entire film has a dreamy, floaty feel to it. The dream sequences themselves are special, filled with uncanny lighting. In an early scene, a room is lit up by an incredible amount of lanterns on the roof.Nolan shows us once again that he is one of the better directors of our time. Nolan isn't nearly even my favorite director, either. But him and his crew's talents, including Zimmer's, have shown us that superhero movies can be good. Now, they have shown us that they know a thing or two about the art of filmmaking. Everything comes together so powerfully well that the film often gave me goosebumps and mild shivers. There is a scene in the film that involves a rotating hallway, and lack of gravity. The music cues in at the perfect moment, and sounds exactly like it needs to sound, create a visual and auditorily symphony that needs to be experienced to be understood. It is Inception's greatest moment.But it is not Inception's only glorious moment. The entire film's soundtrack is unique, and complements the narrative so well. The film has a theme of dream within dreams, and its plot and pacing still manage to flow well. When shots jump from the different levels of the dream, each shot, whether it be representing a moment that is taking 10 seconds of time, or a minute of time, or a half hour of time, works in harmony. The film itself becomes a multi-tiered crescendo moment, which ends up in a reference to my favorite film ever, and a very satisfying release, back into reality.Which leads me to my last point: the ending. A lot of people out there disliked Inception's ending. A lot of people out there look for flaws in Inception. Filmmaking is an art. There are no rules, and no way to define what it is, except for what it is itself. People always seek catharsis in movies. They need the villains, which may represent their inner villains, to be destroyed or cast away. They need closure. They need the ending to be positive and affirming, just like how we want our endeavors in real life to end up well. But the truth is, not everything is for everyone. If you create a work of art, some will like it, and some won't. It can go either way. Just like the endings to some movies can, too.Inception is a work of art and a testament to Nolan and his team's ability. Hans Zimmer creates the best work that he has done in his life, and it is a near masterpiece. Christopher Nolan also creates the best work that he has done in his life, and it is a beacon for contemporary filmmakers. The sights and sounds in this film opened my eyes and ears to what I believe is a new era of filmmaking. It is not to be missed. Inception is incredible on so many levels.",9,1,8,18 August 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," You can build brick walls around a man, impose limitations to his actions and goals, but a man is only trapped on the inside.
","9.0Living in today's time, you might find yourself to be incredibly busy. Or you might find yourself to have nothing but time. Lots of time, and nothing to do. you might feel pressured in by tasks and responsibilities. Jobs, school, family, children, or other obligations/duties. You might feel like you want to escape, even if for a little bit. Even if for just 2 hours. So you head over to the theater. You can catch a 2 hour flick and for those 2 hours, take your mind off the day's and the next day's demands. It can be quite adventurous, if you're seeking that. Or even emotionally gratifying. Truth is, films, and other entertainment, offer escapism. And the producers and creators of these films know this. So, why watch a movie about imprisonment? You might find the subject interesting, if you're keeping in mind that you will most likely never go to prison. So why not watch from the outside, from the other side of the glass mirror. You're safe there, and the film on screen cannot hurt you. The villains or dangers on screen cannot attack you, let alone even perceive you. But the opposite is true. The creators of the films know you are there. You are the reason why the film exists. And they aim to affect you. They sometimes even aim to attack you. And they definitely can. Have you ever watched a movie that 'spoke to you', made you feel something, maybe even made you cry? How could you cry over nonexistent people? How can these nonexistent people affect you? It's because films are a reflection of the world. This reflection, although often exaggerated (sometimes super exaggerated), strike a chord in you. And the music, or the movie, stays in your head. And in your heart.So, once again, why watch a movie about imprisonment? Why would you escape to a place where people want to escape from? You're going into it with the assumption that at the end, the villain is defeated (the villain being the prison), and the characters, which you've somehow come to relate to and care about in the brief hour or two that you've known them, triumph over the villain and escape danger. And admittedly, as exaggerated as that is, you need it. A person does not suffer for no reason. One does not fall to stay down. And besides, who's to say that life inside is not life at all?The Shawshank Redemption is a human tale. It is one of the most down to earth films I've ever seen. Human emotion, thought and spirit is painted onto the screen, while succeeding at using the medium of film for storytelling, resulting in a powerful and well composed movie. The human heart is exposed as a fragile, yet firm organ which endures pain, and even worse, sorrow. It is a pillar of integrity that continues to beat even when the spirit of the person is broken, and hope itself has been lost and forgotten about. However, while the story, pacing and performances will draw you in and not let you go with its stroke of humanity, the film also displays the human being at its worst. Complete disregard for the well being of others, lack of forgiveness and greed are personalities and behaviors that are exhibited in the film. The truth is, mankind is not fit for self judgment. This is exhibited by errors in trial and the need for juries and witnesses. However, it is also fact that the men serving life sentences, although some committed errors whilst in a certain drunken state of mind, are insane.Although there are many faces in The Shawshank Redemption, and some come as far as to redeem themselves a little bit from time to time, there is one character that is static throughout all the film: the prison. It is arguably the best character, giving the best performance as well. There are several shots in the film that display the prison, that are the best shots in the film. This is the core of the film. This is where the atmosphere and tone of the film shine through, albeit gloomy. I just wish that there were more shots of the prison throughout the film. But it is not the main character of the film. While it is a character that speaks to the audience, it is not a relatable character.The Shawshank Redemption is a fine, fine film. It unveils the human heart, and all the wonders and beauties that it is capable of. It also manages to show off the polarity of the human heart. How men are capable of not just ending life, but installing factors like misery, sorrow, and hopelessness in others. Why do we feel trapped at times? Who's keeping you in, and what are they keeping you from? The Shawshank Redemption is a film that will imprison you, and not let you go until it has affected you. And when it finally has affected you, it will set you free. Blue skies, green grass and white clouds are what surrounds us every day. Sometimes we spend too much time in 'the hole', and forget what life is like out there. You may even get used to it, and find yourself feeling like you can't survive on the outside. You may find yourself living in fear out there. But the truth is, you can build brick walls around a man, impose limitations to his actions and goals, but a man is only trapped on the inside. And just like our character Andy Dufresne, we had to come to prison to become a crook. So, 'get busy living, or get busy dying.' And get busy watching The Shawshank Redemption.",9,0,0,3 March 2010
Blade Runner," Its obscure plot is its greatest strength, and its greatest weakness.
","9.2I have a sort of love/hate relationship with Blade Runner. On one hand, I love the atmosphere, costumes, scenery and mood of the entire film. On the other hand, I hate it for its falling short of greatness (in my opinion), and obscure plot.This is the second time I've seen this movie. The first time, I nearly fell asleep. However, I generally enjoyed it, but didn't capture much of the plot. The first time I saw the director's cut. The second time was the final cut. This time around, I found myself thinking halfway into the movie, 'Wait... what the hell is going on here? I don't know where this movie started, and how far I'm into it. Is this a good thing?' I think the reason for my confusion is that Blade Runner is a very sophisticated film. The entire time, I had this feeling that there is much more going on in scenes than there seems to be. This is Blade Runner's greatest strength, and at the same time, it's greatest weakness.It's no wonder either, considering that the theatrical release was dumbed down, for fear that audiences wouldn't respond to it well. Narration was added, and certain scenes were taken out (which contradicts the point of the entire film). Also, a happier ending was used. I haven't seen the theatrical release, but from what I hear, it's not the original vision. If you're going to see it, you might as well see the post release versions. In terms of storytelling, the final cut is not too different from the director's cut.If you go into this film not knowing anything, and come out apathetic towards the plot, chances are you didn't like it too much. But if you go into it aware of the questions it poses (there aren't really any answers), or you come out of it with many questions, chances are you enjoyed it. The film doesn't do much to pose the questions, even the big question, regarding the main character. There is so much going on in the scenes, but like the film's choice of dark environments, it's very difficult to see.It's hard to discuss Blade Runner and avoid spoilers. There are elements like atmosphere and tone that are much easier to discuss. And this is an area where the film has no problems. The 1982 film's vision of the future is impressive, to say the least. It is easy to see that many works of fiction were inspired by Blade Runner. The neo-metropolitan cityscape, the grim street life and polluted air paint a grim picture. But it's so pretty. I wasn't particularly a fan of the type of atmosphere. I like my pictures with clear, blue skies. Or at least grey skies. But Blade Runner's biggest strength is its success in its setting going from the collective imagination of the people who created the film, to the end result that we see. This is the only area of the film that is outstanding.This is a film where audiences will be very divided. I can see a lot of people saying that it is a bore. They might say that it has no plot, or a dull execution of it. They might say that it moves too slow, or that they expected more emotional satisfaction. 'Where is the humanity in this film?', they might ask. The film is asking you, 'what is humanity?' If you care to see what is going on deeper in the scenes, you will end up with a very interesting film, whose bigger questions remain unanswered even today. Either way, however deep you choose to look into the plot and scenes, you must admit, atmospherically, visually, and in terms of tone, this film is a classic.",Null,1,2,5 February 2010
Toy Story 3," Although not as groundbreaking as the original, it is still worth watching due to its excellent characters.
","9.1The original Toy Story was a special release for many reasons. First of all, it was the first full length CGI film. Secondly, it was the first Disney movie to break the mold. In fact, it wasn't even a Disney movie, but it sure had the production values and the overall quality of one. The original Toy Story came together really well, and when you look back, it's easy to see its place in animated film history. 14 years later, Pixar is releasing Toy Story 3, making the series a trilogy. Was this needed? Or was this just a check that needs to be cashed?The answer I think, is both. 11 years is a long time to wait for another Toy Story sequel, the second one having been released in 1999. Still, I feel that this movie was released just to make another Toy Story movie. To date, Pixar has no other sequels. Sure, Toy Story is what made them famous, and it has a special place in their and our hearts, but did we really need another one?Thankfully, Toy Story 3 is actually really good. Of course, you didn't expect it to be bad, but being the third entry in the series one might have been suspecting a weaker film. The nostalgia is handled well, with the plot being that Andy is now growing up and on his way to college. Most of the people who saw the first movie in theaters are now either on their way to college or in college. A lot of the people who will see Toy Story 3 are the ones who saw the first one back when it was released.Once again, the characters (although already established) and voice acting, or digital acting, is excellent in Toy Story 3. Easily the strength of the movie, the characters drive the movie home. There is basically no other reason to watch the movie. The plot itself isn't that great, and some of the new characters aren't that great either. The bear, while a good character, is just a nuisance on-screen. Ken is a welcome addition and both him and Barbie take up a lot of screen time, but he isn't exactly original. The other toys are completely forgettable. The only one that is a pleasure to watch is the monkey.Still, Pixar's crisp humor is still intact. One of the pillars of the first film, the animation and visual quality, is not exactly this film's strongest suit. It's great, but it isn't as impressive as most other Pixar films were at the time of their release. The 3D effect is not necessary, but it was the most comfortable 3D experience I've had yet. Visually, just like Up!, it seems that Pixar has decided to put every single basic and bright color on the screen at once. Like if we were in a candy shop. Uh...Toy Story 3 was made for the fans. And by fans I mean, those of us who saw the original when it came out, and are now college age. Once again, it's a tight production with excellent (despite old) characters and great voice acting. The plot isn't great, and honestly the movie itself isn't as good as everyone else says. Once the nostalgia is over, you may be able to see it for what it truly is. Still, it's worth revisiting and definitely one of the better animated films of recent time.",9,1,1,20 July 2010
Heat," Crime film that offers so much more.
","9.6Has there ever been a moment in your life where you found yourself battling hesitation, or having to make a difficult choice? If so, and that decision was ever to see the movie Heat or not, let me take the burden off your shoulders. Watch this movie.Coming into this, I wasn't expecting much. I figured, sure, a crime movie. Great cast... Michael Mann behind the camera. It has to be pretty good. At least everyone says it is. It's better than that. This is one of those films where I have to erase everything that I knew or thought I knew about it per what everyone else told me, or according to the general opinion about it. Then I have to watch the movie myself, and let every single scene soak in. Heat is essentially a cops and robbers story. You experience the story from both points of views. You see the families of both sides. The good, and the hard times. The initiatives, incentives, and personalities behind both lifestyles. Then it melts them both together. You think, 'yeah, these men are performing horrible acts, and overall bad choices', but you start to care about them as human beings. You want the good guys to win, but at the same time you don't want to see the others fail. There's one scene in particular which brings both worlds together. It's as if the cop and the robber went out for a cup of coffee.I'm not going to say much about the acting. After all, these are men who act, and don't talk much. 'Stop talking, okay, Slick', a robber tells another in the beginning of the film. They get things done and don't really show much emotion while on the job. Al Pacino seasons the detective's role with the salt that he usually brings to the table. Mostly though, what you have here is a story with down to earth characters and down to earth performances.The directing is phenomenal. Michael Mann and crew manage to bring tension to the right scenes, adrenaline where its needed, and just about every other emotion the film brings out at just the right time. The movie slows down and speeds up exactly when it needs to. The use of ambient sound and music is great here. Sometimes I couldn't determine what was an effect, what was music and what was ambiance. There are some shots that are close ups of peoples faces and the emotions on them that are of my favorite scenes in the movie. The movie goes from low-key conversations to high speed shootouts. Tactful scrutiny to emotional outbursts. And never misses a beat.This movie, or maybe I should say film, gives you everything that you'd expect from a crime movie, yet offers so much more. It doesn't glorify crime or the background processes of it. It unveils the people behind it instead, and makes you think about what type of people do these things. They are not good people, that's for sure. But you can't help but think that their skills could have been put to better use. Maybe as detectives, the other side of the crime. Still, you're just going to have to forget about everything that I just said, as well as forget about what you've heard about this movie, and go watch it for yourself.

Gladiator," So emotionally strong and captivating that you will not take your eyes off the screen until it is over. Also, a movie for men.
","8.6It is no secret that men love Gladiator. The film's protagonist is easily relatable to. He is not a rich man, nor a noble. He has a family and a bit of land. He doesn't ask for more than that. However, he is also a soldier. A very good and respected soldier, in fact. He is a general. However, he is still under the rule of a king. That authority oppresses him and takes away what little he had. He manages to gain his respect and recognition back, but he doesn't do this by performing superheroic acts. In fact, most of the time he has his head down. Yet, he is a strong man, one that is able to survive everything that is thrown at him. It is easy to see why Gladiator appeals to men.It also helps that the film is very engaging. The filmmakers take the approach that puts you in the shoes of the protagonist. The protagonist doesn't say much, and only responds in wholehearted mutterings. The film does a very good job of engaging the audience's emotions. Throughout the narrative, it is easy to be captured by the tale and not be able to break free until satisfaction is found. The conclusion of the film comes as a surprise, but it does so in a way that summons so much emotion from the audience that it doesn't leave them with a foul taste afterward.The cinematography in Gladiator is great. From the cold forest that the intro sequence takes place in, to the hot, golden scenes in the desert, almost every scene in Gladiator does a fine job of inviting the audience. There are some very powerful scenes in the movie, such as the sequences where someone is walking through a wheat field, and passing his hand through the wheat. My favorite part of the entire film is that this was included in the beginning of the movie, and not just at the end. The moments where Maximus, the protagonist is near to death, are done very well. There are some mesmerizing moments where he seems to be floating to the afterlife.Of course, Gladiator is not without its imperfections. The film doesn't focus too much on the whole Gladiation thing. I can see this being pretty disappointing to some audiences. However, the gladiatorial chapters are handled very well. Again, the filmmakers display incredible ability to involve audiences. Some of the characters are a little hard to believe, in terms of their actions. Namely, the king and his sister. Some of the things that they do and say are a little unbelievable. Not in the sense that it wouldn't happen, but in the sense that it feels out of place in the film, and it doesn't translate well to the screen. The film is also paced a bit weird. It feels like too much time is spent in the setup, that the middle of the film ends up suffering. Clocking in at about two and a half hours, it's very surprising to see that such little time was spent in the arena.Gladiator is a very powerful film. It has good performances, and an incredible job by the crew. The only thing that holds it back is ultimately the script. Watching the final product, it feels like the pacing is odd, and the script needed to be refocused on different aspects of the film. Still, the filmmaker's ability to strike up emotion in the audiences is the strongest point of the film. Most likely, the film will capture your attention and not let go until its conclusion. It is also a film that appeals greatly to men. Some people say that film-making is all about the story. I think what is more important than the actual content of the narrative, is the execution of it. Not the story itself, but the storytelling. Apparently, Ridley Scott and crew know very well how to tell a story.",8,1,2,3 June 2010
Up in the Air," Up In The Air is a good movie, but ultimately becomes weighed down the protagonist's family.
","8.4I have always loved to be on the move. And I don't mean physically moving, like exercise. I mean changing my location, and making sure that my plans meet that requirement. I find it more interesting to be mobile like this, instead of working in just one place. I do not mind settling down for a while, but I need some novelty. I survive through novelty. I require either for me or my environment to be dynamic. And like I said, I'm not the most active person, physically. I like to sit down in a car, or even an airplane, look outside the window, and relax.Up In The Air is a story about a man that lives the extreme of what I just described. He appears to have no family, no connections, no ties. Nothing to weigh him down, for his occupation requires him to be portable. He works for a company that other companies hire out and request for agents to come and fire or lay off their employees. He travels around the United States, terminating people from their jobs. He is the bearer of bad news, and nothing more than that.Up In The Air starts off really good. Although the audience can't relate to the main character, they can find some rapport. Most everyone has been on an airplane before, possibly even for business reasons. Most everyone knows what it's like to be busy all of the time, always moving and doing. Usually, movies offer an exaggerated depiction of normal people. This is definitely true about the protagonist in Up In The Air.I found the trailer and premise for Up In The Air to be very interesting. I was sure that this movie was going to be one of my favorite movies. Unfortunately, this was not the case. While it does start off good, it soon ends up being anchored down by a side story of sorts. The main character's sister is getting married, and she has asked him to take pictures of a cardboard cut-out of her and her husband all over the country. We soon find out that this is because they can't afford a honeymoon. Not only is this weird, but it feels completely out of place with the rest of the film. And soon after, we are treated to a good chunk of the movie dealing directly with the marriage. Even though I feel that this is necessary for the story to continue, and the main character to develop, it is almost painstaking to watch. Why must we focus so much on these side characters in this side story? It is not what drove me to the film in the first place, and it ended up being what repelled me from the film in the end. It is interesting that the main character feels weighed down by his family and their lives, because it is exactly how I felt about it in regards to the film. Is this what the filmmakers were going for? Somehow, I doubt it.Even though I see the movie as being completely lop-sided by this side story, it is definitely a very nice vessel. The scenes where the main character is firing people, usually just a montage of people's faces and their accompanying reactions, are powerful. You really get to look into these people's eyes and feel the emotion in the scenes. Contrasted by the other half of the protagonist's personality, is the scenes where he is in the airports, or in the airplanes. These scenes are also very entertaining, as he usually narrates what life is like for him on the run. Again, these scenes are directed and shot very well. They match the pacing that his life asks of him.These are the scenes that make Up In The Air what it is. This is the meat of the movie, and it's sad to see that there is so much bone content here. I was really expecting that Up In The Air was going to be one of my favorite movies of all time. Sadly, it wasn't. However, I can't really judge the film for letting me down. I can be as honest as I can and say that the film is weighed down by the marriage side story, and the amount of time the filmmakers decided to spend on it. I did want the character to develop, but during the entire time I was watching these scenes I wanted him to kind of, you know... move along. Up In The Air is an entertaining movie, and there is definitely an audience for it, even though after a certain point, you might not want to settle down with it.",8,0,2,19 May 2010
The Godfather," Greater than the sum of its parts. True art.
","9.8Everybody has heard of The Godfather. You may agree that everybody has seen The Godfather. You might say that everybody loves The Godfather. However, I disagree. It's been 38 years since The Godfather was released in theaters. Although everybody has heard of it, and holds it in high regards, I think that the reason why people enjoy the film is not because of its artistic merits, but its themes and pop culture phenomenon. I also believe that this type of film-making has been lost. Every component of the film holds together well. Each individual aspect of it is finely tuned, and it is seamed together to as close to perfection as the medium allows, as far as we know it. However, it is not the sum of its parts that makes film or art, whatever medium it may be, great. It is not a group full of musicians that makes a record great. It is not great technical and artistic style that makes a painting great. It is not great dialogue, coupled with a good story that makes a novel great. I believe that when these components of an artistic medium are in harmony, it helps to allow for art to form. The Godfather has all of these components in spades and also becomes art.The post WWII atmosphere, set in the midst of Italian crime organizations is engraved into the film. The colors are brown, gold and black, perfectly matching the antique tone. The acting is exceptional, with some performances by young actors that acted as a stepping stone for their careers. The music, while used sparingly, comes in and out at just the right times, and matches the mood of the film well.The camera angles, cinematography and editing are why I used the term near- perfect. There are certain scenes in this film that are simply the best in all of film-making. One of the final scenes, interlaced with a baptism, is an amazing example of using the medium of film-making and its techniques such as editing and directing to inspire emotion and create art. Another scene, which simply just involves one person against a black background, and a single light source above them, is in my opinion one of the best shots of all time, not just in film-making, but photography as well. The Godfather's greatest feat is not that it is a cultural phenomenon. It is, by all definitions, art. You might call expression and aesthetic values by themselves art, but ultimately it is pieces like The Godfather that inspires artists. There is a reason as to why half of this review is talking about art and not The Godfather. The film deserves to be seen, regardless of what you all ready know or what you think you might know about it. Regardless of its theme and setting, the work that the men and women did during the production of this film and its final form deserve to be recognized. This style of film-making is far and few between nowadays, and if you enjoy cinema, you owe it to yourself to experience Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather.",10,1,1,22 February 2010
