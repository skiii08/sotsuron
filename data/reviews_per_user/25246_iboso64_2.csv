Sucker Punch," Cut Scene, the Movie
","It should have been called 'Cut Scene, the Movie.' Vapid and empty, I'll bet it looked great in 3-D: Dreadful, dreadful, and dreadful. A decent cast and better-than-average video game-style graphics wasted.",3,2,7,25 April 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," The Prettiest Garbage You're Likely to See All Year
","Beautiful looking. Bruce Dern steals his one scene. Leo nails it. Brad Pitt plays the kind of guy we all think Brad Pitt is. And the rest is absolute garbage. Long and meandering, spot-the-celebrity, the smart nerd who got picked on in school making smart nerd who got picked on school fantasies for other nerds who got picked on in school. QT has trivialized slavery, the Holocaust, and now, sensationalized murder. I skipped Hateful 8, so I don't know what kind of horse dung he shoveled in that, but I know the people around him likely made it look pretty. How better the world would be if only he got to write history. I wonder what he'll trivialize, next.",3,12,22,2 August 2019
