Vertigo," treatise on romantic love and obsession
","This masterpiece is an oft misunderstood treatise on the nature of romantic love and the ways in which we choose the people we wish to have relationships with. Stewart's character's obsession with a woman who does not really exist is a powerful look at the way we posture to attract and remake or mold others into what we want them to be. The fact that Madeline is married does not deter Scotty, the possibility that she is either haunted or out of her mind slows him not a step. Even when she dies, he continues to search for her, pursuing the love and even accepting a man-made ( by himself) imitation to bestow his obsession upon. It is only when he realizes that another man has concocted his paramour, that he has fallen for somone else's ideal woman, that Scotty gives up. 'It's no good Madeline, we can't bring it back.' No, but we can keep watching it over and over again, as obsessed with the film as is Scotty with the woman.",Null,2,3,8 June 1999
The Sound of Music," the movie that made me a critic
","Once upon a time, when I was a child I thought certain truths were immutable... in the passing of time I found that almost none were. One of these truths that bit the bullet rather early in life was that all movies were good movies. Especially those films that everybody simply loved. At nine years old, I was taken by my parents to see 'The Sound of Music'... I wasn't crazy about it... but I figured I probably just didn't get it. When it was rereleased a few years later and I was 12 or so... I went to see it again with school. At that point I realized that the movie was just not that good! I couldn't wait to leave the theatre, I was bored to tears. I came to the conclusion that day that I was just never meant to be one of the 'masses'... sheeple who have no real opinion of their own. So for that I am forever indebted to this film. I also must caution men not to read any women's reviews of this movie as something about it causes their brains to go completely dead. How else can one explain anyone wanting to see someone fall in love with Christopher Plummer's character? Not masculine in any way (except that he has fathered a number of children) I feel he has caused more women to enter into disfunctional relationships and lead lonely lives in search of an unattainable male (gay?)than any other character in film history. p.s. I have since, in the last few years attempted the Sound of Music again and now find it absolutely unwatchable.",Null,8,18,18 February 2003
Monster," persuasive sexist excercise...
",I must admit that I knew what I was going to get when I sat down to watch Monster.. not because anyone had told me but because I know Hollywood and the kind of films it puts out. I didn't know that the writer-director was a woman but I wasn't surprised. What was surprising was how persuasive the film was..which is unfortunate in some ways because it's attempt to portray Wurnos's story as a love story is embarrassing when you know the facts. Theron does give an excellent performance and look remarkably like Wurnos'... I just can't figure out why they couldn't make Ricci up to look more like her real life counterpart. It is this kind of intellectual dishonesty ( like leaving out that Wurnos killed most of her victims by posing as a disabled motorist in need of help) that truly mark the film. How fascinating that America's first female serial killer turns out to really be a victim herself...how could it have been any other way? How sexist... unless of course the director is thinking of making a film about the family friend who repeatedly raped Wurnos when she was 8 with the same kind of empathy.   Fat chance!!!,Null,1,3,19 July 2004
The Others," Shining Innocents
","Although I was able to figure out the 'secret' of this film rather early on, it did not diminish my appreciation of it one bit. Very stylish and subtle it reminded me most of The Innocents (1961) with a touch of The Shining to give it body. Higher praise from me it could not have hoped to garner.",Null,0,0,2 June 2002
Taxi Driver," in complete a-chord
","Revisited Taxi Driver last night after perhaps a decade away. It is still brilliant and fresh for those of us who recall the NYC it portrays. Read a lot of the reviews on the site and most people get it so there's no point repeating what has already been said. However, as it concerns the scoring of the picture, if you listen closely Bernard Herrmann has concluded the film with exact same chords as he did Psycho when he worked for Hitchcock (revealing perhaps his or the director's link to Norman Bates). Check it out! You don't have Psycho? Shame on you, go and get it then along with Taxi Driver you will have seen two of the most important American films of the last fifty years. p.s. If you like Taxi Driver you will almost assuredly like Paul Schraeder's MISHIMA...easily the greatest film no one has ever seen.",Null,1,1,27 August 2003
Forrest Gump," Gomer Pyle meets Rudy...
","It doesn't really surprise me that so many people think Forrest Gump is a great film... it only reconfirms my feelings about the average filmgoer. Simply a poor man's Zelig (that's another film for those who don't know) that's been dumbed down to reach the television audience. Anyone who really believes that 'Life's like a box of chocolates...' is too naive to even be reached...yeah, life's like a box of chocolates if some of the selections were confections and some excrement. Don't mean to sound bitter but live a half century (with your eyes open!) and see if you don't agree...by the way what type of chocolate did it taste like to you when you saw the world trade center collapse? Gump is Gomer Pyle who can't sing...and before you rush to defend...it's been 10 years and what were Zemeckis' other great films?",Null,5,11,13 July 2004
American History X," Guess Hoods Coming to bleeping Dinner?
","American History X is a great film... a great film to use as a means to distinguish between people who know what they're talking about when it comes to film, and those that only pretend. This is not a terrible film by any means. However, when a director takes on a meaty subject matter, it is maddening when he has nothing to say. I prefer to believe that Kaye and co. merely bowed to pressure in the way this film caved, but judging from the gritty jailrape and foul language I have to believe that they simply weren't up to the task. What begins as an interesting look into neo-nazism ends up to be about as enlightening experience as  a Disney film. Imagine 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?' with full frontal nudity and racist obscenity. Those who believe this to be a great film need to see more films. I'd rather see someone reach for the moon and fail than reach for a beer and succeed, but to begin that reach and fail through lack of commitment is, like this film, merely pathetic.",Null,0,0,11 June 1999
Ocean's Eleven," '...it's allright, allright, allright by me' (but just)
","Watched both the original of this and remake on consecutive nights. Rat Pack version isn't really very good...messy and overlong. New version is tighter more up tempo...but has no heart. Angie Dickinson makes Julia Roberts look like Emily Dickenson. New version was more entertaining, but I would have junked them both to hear Sinatra sing one song. Truthfully new plot has holes big enough to build a vault in, but I won't quibble since I wasn't bored. If you watch a lot of t.v. you might think this was a 'masterpiece' as one person wrote.",Null,0,1,29 June 2002
Yesterday," Not totally unique premise...
","Very disappointing effort for Danny Boyle, pretty much standard fare for Curtis. Not for serious filmgoers. Unique concept? In 'Peggy Sue Got Married' Peggy Sue gifts a slew of Beatles lyrics to her wannabe rock star boyfriend/future husband a decade before their actual release after she travels back in time. It amounted to a ten minute side story in a much better film than this one. Question: if Oasis never existed- how did Jack sing the awful 'Wonderwall' as a youth at the talent show? Love story was hard to swallow- but that's standard fare, as I have said, for Curtis- never believed it for a second. But all else pales to the colossal mistake of dropping an Ed Shering turd in the middle of this beautiful pristine pond of great music- Summer Song was better.",4,1,3,18 February 2020
Batman Begins," 'I'm Batman'...no you aren't....
","I've been interested in Batman for over forty years and every once in a while I hear something about a new BATMAN project and I get my hopes up...by now I should know better what they mean is a NEW Batman project. Okay kiddies, write this down, there has never been nor will there ever be a really faithful BATMAN film. Batman now exists in so many incarnations that there is now way to remain true to the character enough to please all the fanatics ready to dissect it. While I confess relief that there were many reviews here that didn't care for the film I had to laugh at people who disputed the character elements based on post Bob Kane creations. If someone other than Kane was allowed to change Batman's character than anyone should be allowed the same privilege provided they do it with good intention. The film itself is actually pretty good for the first half before it falls apart in the second half (a very common malady these days in film).I thought the supporting cast was pretty strong. The two leads, however, are a different story. Katie Holmes is not worth writing about (regardless of what we think she will be a big star...it's written in the Tom Cruise wedding contract). Christian Bales tries, but fails, as Batman. Shallow as it may sound, if you are going to have your lead actor don a mask among his attributes must be a good lower face and voice. Bales upturned corners of his upper mouth kept making me think he should be Catman rather than Batman. His voice is terrible and its raspish disguise reminded me of Lord Humongous from Road Warrior. I say that in order to segue into another thought...film is best at 'Superhero' type film when it creates it's own myth and character. The Road Warrior is a perfect example of this. Writer and director create their own characters and turn them into mythical beings. There is no argument from the viewers about whether Max would really have done this or had that type of car. And the end product, in MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR ,is a film far superior to any hero/fantasy film done since.",Null,2,5,15 July 2005
Meet the Fockers," Geat idea for another sequel...
","Just saw MTF and got a great idea for a sequel... the Fockers and the Ryans go on vacation to Europe where they run into all kinds of zany characters... Kenneth Branagh as a schizo prince...maybe Gary Oldman as a excessively flatulent cab driver...what a pity George C. Scott has passed on, in drag he could have been the perfect Grandma Focker. Seriously folks, the people who paired Deniro and Hoffman are to be praised...just think if they had been around long ago perhaps they could have gotten Shakespeare and Oscar Wilde to write together... perhaps they could have written dirty jokes or, even better, subway graffiti. Anyone who doesn't see this movie for the disgrace that it is has no business writing about film. To take two actors of this caliber and waste them on a souped up TV sitcom... well lets just say the producers should never be allowed to ATTEND another film much less make one. Marlon Brando left Hollywood, stopped making films, retreated to a desert island, gained 500 pounds and pretty much made a joke out of himself when his acting career essentially was over... too bad Robert Deniro couldn't have done the same. An embarrassment for everyone involved...except Ben Stiller...for him this film represents the high point of his career. See a bootleg...films like this represent a bigger danger to film-making than pirating does.",1,8,14,18 January 2005
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Fortune Cookie, Fighting Video
","Interesting, if grossly overrated, film seems as if it was concocted by a fortune cookie factory worker who fell asleep with a video game on the television. Praiseworthy only for its ambitiousness and special effects, I have to assume the critical buzz was more due to the lack of interesting work around than the realization of Ang Lee's vision. Anyone who thinks this film has something to say probably marveled at Star Wars.",Null,0,0,13 February 2001
The Hurt Locker," Pretenders from contenders....
","When I logged on to IMDb to check out some specifics about The Hurt Locker, I had no real intention of writing a review. I was shocked by how many people didn't 'get' the film. I thought the film was a slam-dunk and represented Bigelow finally fulfilling the promise of 'Near Dark'. Admittedly, I never questioned the films accuracy (though I figured it probably wasn't accurate- few films are). To me, it's more important for the film to be good- and this one is. It's the tightest film I've seen in a long time- simple and straightforward- but with enough depth to merit repeat watchings. I just didn't expect it to be a measuring stick for film knowledge- the kind of film that exposes some peoples' lack of film instincts- much in the way Hitchcock's films did when they were first released (remember that he never won the accolades in his day that he deserved). For serious cinephiles- don't miss The Hurt Locker- you won't get another one like this for a long time.",Null,1,6,27 January 2010
Moulin Rouge!," not for pretenders
",I don't feel like wasting my time talking to a lot of pretenders who believe that because they see a lot of 'movies' they have somehow become sophisticated about film. If you love film don't miss this one. Whether or not it appeals to your particular tastes you will marvel at how innovative and different it is. How great a success you believe it to be will depend on how highly you weigh these virtues (and in today's great film wasteland they are indeed virtues). As for myself I was dragged into watching this kicking and screaming and I'm thrilled to say... I was thrilled.,Null,0,1,20 March 2002

Mulholland Drive," Lynch's cube
","Mulholland Drive is a fascinating if exasperating film that operates more as a kind of chinese puzzle than a narrative. Personally, I don't find such things in the least unpleasent if they're well done (as this is). But one should know before viewing it that it will take a lot of work to decipher the film's meaning..at which point you might feel somewhat empty. David Lynch is a brilliant technical director, but unfortunately or, if you are of a mind fortunately, he has no soul. This being so, his characters have no real soul, they do not resonate. When his work succeeds it does so on a technical level, filmaking for filmmakers not for film lovers. The only mark they leave is the breaking of traditional rules of cinema, and some usually quirky characters that have idiosyncracies in place of personalities. All this said this is a must see film for any serious film follower.",Null,1,2,21 November 2002
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," ...we need the eggs...
","Interesting film that I couldn't help comparing to the 70's relationship defining film Annie Hall. You see, I find it right on that this relationship film is defined by its era... peoples brains are treated like computers. Certainly a film worth watching although neither lead character is very likable and Annie Hall seemed a whole lot more like real life. Didn't get too many laughs out of this one either, must mean Jim Carrey did some good acting. Totally illogical and seriously flawed (the relationship was obviously tailored to fit the sci-fi premise...children or a decade together would have really have mucked up the process) -7 out of 10.",7,0,2,1 January 2005
The Fountain," worth the wade...
","Just when I had begun to think that maybe I really DON'T like film all that much- after sitting through dozens and dozens of so-called award winning fare that I found mediocre and a waste of time - or watched gimmicky 'art' films recommended here and by friends only to find no substance once the secret of the film was deciphered- after having to be satisfied with films that I considered 'very good' despite (usually) one major flaw- I happened upon The Fountain. It's worth wading through all the drek that's out there if once in a great while you find a film like this.The Fountain is amazing. Ambitious and truly felt it has a cathartic feel to it. Full marks to all involved. I can't say I'm surprised that Aronfsky was capable of this- it's just that I'm surprised anyone is this good. Not a film for everyone- it demands that you give yourself over to it. And you will probably find you either get it- or you don't...(you know, kind of like life).",Null,1,2,2 April 2008
The Departed," separating the pretenders from the contenders...
","I kind of love films like The Departed. With its big name talent, long running time, and compelling (if somewhat hard to swallow) story it sends many wannabe film critics off to their pc to rave about using words like 'classic', 'brilliant', and even (gulp) 'masterpiece'. Let's start with the positive...the story, basically adapted from Infernal Affairs (which I purposely have not seen yet)is interesting and draws you into the film. Matt Damon and Mark Wohlberg were very good. Damon is so good he throws the film out of balance, since he is supposed to be the 'mirror' of DeCaprios character. DeCaprio, alas, is not up to the task of holding up his end. He seems to be growing up (applause) but he has really grown little as an actor. Some of his scenes here were painful to watch: the 'rat' scene with Nicholson (in which he was 'acting' all over the place) and one scene where he pistol-whipped someone was only slightly better than Donald Trump vs. WWF. But don't blame Leo- the blame must fall directly on Scorcese for letting him get away with such an amateurish performance that even the academy (which is rarely too embarrassed for anything) was too embarrassed to nominate. And you can't say Scorcese doesn't know good acting from bad. It's too bad that he seems to have lost some of his passion for film-making, he was one of our very best edgy directors. This film looked like it could have been directed by just anyone. On the plus side I did remain interested until the end, unlike Gangs of New York and the Aviator,but on the minus side the last fifteen minutes of this film are so bad it makes you leave thinking the film is worse than it really is. It isn't a bad film, it's an over-hyped mediocre film done by big names. Just the kind of film that trips up...the pretenders.",Null,2,4,11 April 2007
The Witch," Worth watching but not a masterpiece...
","I rarely ever write reviews anymore- refuse to rate films on a 1-10 scale- and NEVER watch trailers (you guys who watch them- do you also answer phone calls telling you you've been selected to go on a cruise for free?). I, however, felt the urge to write a little concerning Eggers' The Witch- since I watched (and enjoyed) it and, after reading such disparate reviews I felt like chiming in with my own take. 
I'll let you in on a little secret, if I hear about a film and want to decide if it's worth seeing, I come to IMDB and read the user reviews. If the film has many high AND low ratings from users-it's worth a try. The Witch was just such a film- horror films that are criticized for being 'slow' and having 'like no plot' in the low ratings are a slam dunk to be good. 
This is really a very nice little film- but it could have been so much better. I felt that the director was probably made to compromise his vision of the psychological breakup of a Puritan family due to various issues (religious fervor, isolation, jealousy, insecurity, and most importantly the onset of puberty). I find it hard to believe that Eggers ever really intended for the satanic forces to be made visible to the audience (at least not in the sensational way they are)- the viewing of the witch and the baby early in the film destroys the possibility that what is going on here isn't really supernatural at all- and that is the lens through which this film presents its best face. I'd like to think he merely caved to pressure from 'money guys' to 'sex up his movie' to please the lower level viewers (and, indeed, he didn't even sex it up enough for those Philistines- who wouldn't know a great film if the screen fell forward onto their laps)- sadly this really hurts the film. I will say, however, that i will be anxiously waiting for his next film with the hope that as he achieves enough success he will be able to present his true vision.

There Will Be Blood," Powerful...
","Was amazed at Paul Anderson's 'There Will Be Blood'. It was a quantum leap for a director who has always had the audacity, if not the material, to be great. It really pains me to see so many negative reviews- anyone truly serious about film that doesn't 'get' this film needs to go back and watch it again. Sadly, some people probably still won't get it...oh well that's what makes good taste good...not everyone has it. I found it riveting from the first frame and I don't care if it doesn't follow the Sinclair book exactly- read The Shining sometime- none of what makes the film brilliant is in the book. A great director has the right to read the book and throw it away- Anderson has shown himself worthy to do so here.",Null,1,3,12 September 2008
Vanilla Sky," Close your eyes...
","Since I loved Open Your Eyes and I dislike both Tom Cruise and Cameron Crowe I waited a long time between viewing the two films. It didn't help. This a sorry look at just what's wrong with American filmaking in general: lack of originality, lack of subtlety, no respect for the audience (though you can't completely blame them). 'Open Your Eyes' was a tone poem, Vanilla Sky like the directions and information you get with a new prescription. Got to believe Alex sold them the rights to remake so Cruise would front the money for his next film (The Others). Under those circumstances you would expect the film to be a bomb...so much for karma.Is there a way we could all chip in to keep these two from ever making another film again. I pity anyone who sees this version first...they have been robbed .",Null,0,0,9 July 2002
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Not one word...
","I have the utmost respect for Woody Allen as a filmmaker ( I probably own more than a dozen of his films) and was very excited to hear that VCB was so well received by critics. Wow, what an incredible disappointment it turned out to be. I did not believe ONE WORD of this script- not one situation- not one character. Without going into great detail I'll just say I agreed with many of the negative reviews on this site concerning where the film failed: the narration ( jaw droppingly awful, the acting ( perhaps with the exception of Cruz) and the writing ( how badly did this script need a rewrite). If the film could have been saved it would have been by the last scene- but alas, by then the ship had sunk. I'm not giving up on Woody, he's too good a writer (maybe he could write about something he knows- like getting old- it might not be marketable but it could be great). Once Woody's film persona complained about TV audiences taste level 'having been systematically lowered'- unfortunately that's where his good reviews are now coming from. Oh , and Penelope Cruz being nominated for this instead of 'Elegy' is an act that borders on the criminal.",Null,4,11,20 September 2009
Cube," what if a writer woke up one day....
","What if a writer woke up one day with a premise for a scifi project and then became trapped hopelessly by the idea with no way to bring it to completion? Such is the dilemma in 'Cube'. Although perhaps I'm underestimating this film: maybe the idea that the people spend all this time and effort to end up in the cube they started in (and, indeed,should simply have stayed there all along) is an analogy for the audience having just wasted the last 90 odd minutes and, indeed, should have not bothered with the trip at all. Terrifyingly like something I wrote and later threw away when I was in high school. Two points for retro creativity in set design.",2,2,5,2 August 2008
Donnie Darko," The Last Temptation of Harvey...
","Saw this film at the request of my teenage daughter. Very interesting, if somewhat flawed, story of a shizo high schooler and the end of his life. There are so many comments on the site that I couldn't read them all but I was distressed by the fact that none of the ones I perused grabbed the gigantic clue the director left for them as to what's really going on. On the marquee at the movie theatre where Donnie goes with his girlfriend there are two films listed. See BOTH films... most of you have probably already seen Evil Dead ( but see it if you haven't it's a good scare) the other film is the key to this film. Watch it in its entirety! You will learn two things: 1) how to understand this film and 2) that before you go off writing film reviews you really need to have a greater frame of reference.",Null,0,1,1 November 2004
