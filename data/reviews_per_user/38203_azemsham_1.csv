Mission: Impossible III," Non stop action??? NOT
","Are you kidding me? 'The action really is non-stop, and there aren't any cheesy love scenes slowing anything down.' What movie were you watching? This movie DOES have 'cheesy love' scenes and all kinds of other touchy-feely crap that just droned on. 20 minutes could have been knocked off if they removed all the 'sap' from this flick. Tom-Tom (Ethan Hunt) even cried like a little girl on a number of occasions. While there were quite a few action scenes, they were unrealistic and totally unbelievable. This is just like all the rest of the standard sequels; the first great, the second not so great, the third horrible. If you have a couple of hours to kill, that you'd never want back, then have at it.My final opinion: wouldn't even pay the $3.00 to rent this dog. Unless someone you know has bought/rented it, wait for it to come out on one of the movie channels.",4,0,1,5 November 2006
