Miracle," Another movie to tell how someone utilises others to please himself
","It is always like this. The rival team is portrayed as ruthless demons and our own team is like just league. The final scene makes me sick. The trainer just walk away to a corridor and cry which makes me feel he never realises that he and the team is together, he walks away because his own dream is fulfilled. And the team are happy on the ground, no one asks where the trainer is. So it is like the team is happy because they win a hard game and the trainer is happy because his dream come true and nothing more than that. It is not about the sportsmanship on the ground at all.",1,1,15,22 November 2019
Joker," Metacritics is getting shitter
","After viewing why the prestigiously gorgeous Metacritics gives such a score, I believe these 'critics' are just trying to reject the hype of the movie, so that they tell the other audience that they are special, professional, unlike normal ones. The worst comment comes from the New Yorker. It uses the majority of that article to tell that the director whitewashes some cases that the critic believes by which the scenes in the film are inspired, criticising that it makes the film empty. Well, vaffanculo!!!",10,1,3,15 October 2019
