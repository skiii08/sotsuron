Iron Man 3," Good Movie!
","Went to see it at the BFI Imax Cinema in Waterloo, London. Very good because it was a big screen and made it more enjoyable. I tend to not like Marvel films however I did think Iron Man 3 was a spectacular film in many ways. People may not like it but it was action- packed and a good film to see. The story-line to the film was very good and the story 'inter-linked' in a good way. Robert Downey. Jr. was probably the best person to play Iron Man / Tony Stark as it fitted in with his role of Acting. The story was, however, a modern day, 'Man saves the world kind-of story'. On the other hand-it was not that good because we see this kind of story in 'Spider-Man', 'Captain America' and other films.",6,0,1,11 May 2013
Fast & Furious 6," Can't Wait for #7
","I am a huge fan of The Fast and The Furious Series. The movie was very good because 'Epic' bits to parts of the film where it seemed unrealistic.I feel that Fast Five seemed a bit better because it seemed more realistic. In the ending moments there was a runway scene which went on for ages another was that Dom acted like Superman about 5/7th of the way through the film. It was a very good film and no wonder it is the 2nd Highest Grossing Film of 2013. The story line of the film was very good as we knew towards the start that they had to take down as 'Bad Person'. Music by Lucas Vidal was very good, especially 'We Own It' and 'Bandoleros'. Justin Lin has been a very good Director for the main part of the Series except for Tokyo Drift which has been the worst in the series and will be sad that James Wan takes over to direct the 7th one, however we can only hope that he takes the series to even greater heights for the Big Finale. Being the 14th Highest Grossing Movie Franchise of all time the Studio, Universal needed to make sure it met the criteria and I feel this film checked all the boxes...",9,0,2,23 June 2013
