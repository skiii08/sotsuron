Walk the Line," Last year...
","this movie was called Ray. Walk the line is your standard biopic about a deceased rock star, complete with all of the expected story lines. In case you haven't seen Ray, here you go: small child loses brother in tragic accident. Boy grows up, gets discovered, has a problem with drugs and alcohol, cheats on his wife, gets arrested for drug possession, gets his life straightened out. The end.There really isn't anything new to add in Walk the Line, which is truly unfortunate. The performances by Witherspoon and Phoenix are top notch and they both sing their parts extremely well (side note - don't hold it against Jaime Foxx for not singing in Ray because no one sounds like Ray Charles except Ray Charles. Any bass can sing Johnny Cash - his voice isn't that distinctive.) The characters, unfortunately, really don't have that much to say. In the end, Cash appears to be a really moronic spoiled brat - not exactly a glowing tribute to a music star. The movie seemed more like a vehicle to sell Johnny Cash albums to a new generation without having to pay royalties since both he and his wife are now deceased.I don't know why these same formulaic biopics are still being made. I wouldn't keep watching them if my wife didn't like them. No one's life is so boring that you can fit its entire essence into two hours.",5,4,14,28 November 2005
Brokeback Mountain," Not a good script, which is a damn shame.
","My viewing of Brokeback Mountain admittedly suffered from the hype surrounding the movie. Throw the Golden Globe for Best Drama on top of the other critical acclaim and you have the makings for a tremendous movie, right? Brokeback Mountain, as everyone knows by now, surrounds the relationship of two cowboys from the time they meet forward for twenty years. Ennis Del Mar (Ledger) and Jack Twist (Gyllenhall) meet when they take a ranching job in the mountains of Wyoming. Their relationship develops slowly with neither character saying much to the other. At one point, Del Mar says about three lines of dialog and that is followed by a comment from Twist 'that's more than you've said in the past two weeks' to which Del Mar responds 'friend, that's more than I've said in a year.' Therein lies the problem with Brokeback Mountain. There really isn't anything thrown to the viewer to give you a reason to believe the relationship between the two cowboys. There isn't a shared past or a deep, meaningful conversation about anything or even loneliness. It is really difficult to believe that any of the characters really care about each other. By the time Del Mar and Twist separate after their initial encounter, it is downright impossible to sense any sort of chemistry or feelings between the two. The next time they meet, its as though they were war buddies reunited after 25 years. It just doesn't work. The main problem with the film is that this is one of the worst scripts in recent memory. The movie jumped in time after short scenes with little dialog or development, sometimes as much as ten years. It is a shame that this was so poorly written because the acting is outstanding, the direction was good and the scenery fantastic. All of that can't save a terribly written and developed story. I don't believe that this movie would have received all of its accolades if this script was about a straight couple - the relationships between all of the characters wasn't good enough to make the movie meaningful. I rarely agree with the Top 1000 voters, but do in this case.",5,4,34,23 January 2006
Million Dollar Baby," I was never bored...
","If you are a fan of the movies, and you probably are since you have come to IMDb and are reading movie reviews, then you will probably not be bored during Million Dollar Baby. The story and the characters are interesting enough to keep your attention and I didn't have any issues with the pace of the movie, but this was a fairly average movie. What was well done? The performances by Clint Eastwood, Hillary Swank and Morgan Freeman were superior and easily the best part of the film. I'm not entirely sure why Morgan Freeman decided to rasp his already deep voice for the film as it was unnecessary. Lighting was used very effectively throughout enhancing the dark nature of the film. Other than those facets, I had a few problems with the movie.Perhaps I would not be so disappointed had this film not won the award for best picture. I don't understand the fascination with Clint Eastwood in Hollywood. He is an excellent actor, but his directorial skills are pretty average. He doesn't do anything particularly unique to enhance a movie or tell the story in a different way.It seems to me that he also missed an opportunity in the movie. Since the story centers on loneliness and love and opportunity, he could have used silence effectively. That being said, the entire narration of the movie could be eliminated in favor of silence and the movie may have been a little more powerful. There were also several unrealistic points in the movie, such as certain occurrences in the boxing matches and in his conversations with the priest that just wouldn't happen in normal situations.This movie was okay. It wasn't great and it wasn't horrible - definitely not best picture worthy.",6,1,3,8 August 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Not much improvement seen
","When I first heard that they were going to remake Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, I thought that it was an odd movie to remake. Sure, the movie in the 70s was a little campy, but could also be considered a classic children's movie that succeeds very well on its own. I didn't feel that it had the same potential to improve as a movie like Oceans 11 would.The remake of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory actually starts out quite strong. There is more background behind the motivation of Wonka to open up his factory and the personalities of the children have been given a face-lift as well. Americans really are pretty annoying. Up until the time where the children reach the Wonka factory, I felt that the movie actually had improved upon the old.And then comes Johnny Depp as Willie Wonka. Let me preface my next comment by saying that I enjoy Johnny Depp in most everything and dislike Gene Wilder in most everything. The Willie Wonka character came off as someone you wouldn't let your child within ten miles of, much less go into a factory with. The performance of Willie Wonka was one of the worst that I have seen in recent memory. Perhaps some of that feeling was also due to the fact that the chocolate factory had lost much of its charm from the original film. The oompa loompas were forgettable, as was the music, and it seemed like much of the happiness of the original movie was sapped.The end of the film was also changed from the original version in a way that I didn't care for either. Without being too specific, in the original, Charlie drinks the fizzy soda which was against Mr. Wonka's rules and loses his prize. In the end, though, Charlie realizes that what he did was wrong and decides not to seek vindication against Wonka. In the current movie, Charlie is never posed with any question of vindication, nor does he do anything wrong that would exclude his eligibility from winning a prize.The film is decent with a nice update on the pre-factory portion of the movie, but much of the magic of the factory is missing from the current film and Wonka's character has a very unsavory feel. This film does not significantly improve upon its predecessor and therefore deserves no more than an average grade.",5,0,1,14 November 2005
Pulp Fiction," Half of the movie is great
","Pulp Fiction is definitely a movie that can be watched over and over so that you can pick up more of the giant metaphor that Tarrantino puts on the screen. I can't give this a perfect score, however, because the more I watch this movie, the longer and longer the Thurman-Travolta story seems to take. The portions of the movie with Samuel L., John Travolta and Bruce Willis are by far the most interesting portions of the story - there is better dialogue and what lies behind the curtain is more substantial. The hour or so with Uma Thurman is simply not very interesting. It bogs the story down, bringing the movie almost to a halt. I like the way Tarrantino directs the film and the screen play is excellent, though there is so much swearing that it is almost difficult to overcome. I don't know anyone that swears nearly as much as these characters do (typical of anything QT has written) - newsflash Quentin, outswearing a Marine doesn't add to a story.Much better than average, but not exceptional. *** of ****",7,1,2,8 December 2004
Ray," Best Picture candidate?
","This movie is essentially about a music superstar's heroine problem. He is mistreated by others and he mistreats them. He is a womanizer who doesn't really seem to care about anything except his music. These traits are not unique in the music industry. I was tremendously disappointed that very little of the movie focused on what made Ray Charles, Ray Charles. This movie could have been about anyone, not just Ray. Both Jamie Foxx's performance and the soundtrack were phenomenal, but the rest of the movie was uninspired. Only the acting gives this flick a 7. Not a good movie.There is a fair amount of time spent in flashbacks between Ray and his mother, adequately showing the development of this relationship, but doesn't have resounding thunder in developing who he was as a person. It is nice to know that we get second chances in life, but we don't see Ray getting his in the movie other than a couple of lines at the end. Maybe I didn't care for the movie because it is a biopic and, personally, I find real life far less interesting than a good imagination. How can you tell someone's life story in 2.5 hours? Is life really that boring?",7,3,5,27 June 2005
Sin City," Good, but overrated
","The lighting, direction and effects in this movie were all tremendous. Simply put, there is no way that this movie could have been made 15 years ago because the special effects would not likely have been capable or affordable to manipulate the shots in every single scene. I do not believe that you can hold that against a film, however, unless there is no plot to go along with the mass of effects (i.e. War of the Worlds).So it has come to this, though. Sin City certainly lives up to its name in telling a story with no real redeeming morality. Duh, it is called SIN city. For about half of the movie, I kept laughing at all of the violence because it was fairly comical. After the initial hour, though, I kept wondering if this is what our society has come to. Does it really require this much violence to keep us entertained? Even if it is not required, why do people keep asking for so much violence? I am not an advocate for any sort of censorship, but I am an advocate for personal responsibility for each individual. It is possible that I started thinking about this because the Clive Owen portion of the story wasn't really all that interesting to me.Sin City was entertaining, but I didn't fell that it was as interesting as its comic counterpart, Dick Tracy. There is a much more modern feeling to SC than there is in DT, but I don't know if that is a good thing. I found the characters and art direction in DT more interesting, perhaps BECAUSE it didn't rely on special effects. I really don't understand why there is such a mismatch between the two in ratings. Sin City was good, but I wouldn't consider it a great film. It seems to me that a lot of people like this one because it makes them seem sophisticated. Its just one man's opinion.",7,1,2,6 September 2005
