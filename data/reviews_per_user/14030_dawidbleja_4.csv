Requiem for a Dream," YOU MAY NOT WANT TO READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM YET
","This film is about as cheap a play on emotions as you can get. A lot of people found this film offensive because it was graphic and brutal, I found it offensive because it treated me like an idiot. It's like, OK, I want to make a film that people will walk out and say 'Wow, that really affected me, what an intense and touching film!' So, I'll get four characters, and I'll just screw 'em up real bad. That's all it's gonna be, I'm just gonna try and think of the worst way I can possibly screw each of them up, and then I'll screw 'em up - and people will come out bawling, thinking that, 'well, I'm bawling, so it MUST have been a good film!'
Without being too harsh, the film did have a few (but only a few) good things about it, mainly visual things. However, the predominant feature of Requiem for a Dream is it forcefully trying to squeeze emotion out of you. I'm sorry, but there's more to a good film than just something which crudely forces you to feel shaken and sick in the stomach. A good kick below the belt will achieve a similar effect, and any idiot can do that. Sure, make a film that will make us feel shaken and hurt, but do it creatively! Don't just go for the easiest, bluntest, most transparent and hollow option! 'Cause the only emotion I felt when the credits came up in Requiem for a Dream was a slight anger for paying to see it and then laughter when I saw tears in the eyes of the person next to me. Because since the 'emotion-squeezing' didn't work on me, I was pretty bored throughout the film as there was little else to it.4/10. See PI instead.",4,13,28,7 March 2002
Barry Lyndon," As with many Kubrick films, the use of light and music are fantastic.
","I never thought that I'd be the sort of person to come out of a film raving about the use of light. But, to my surprise, after seeing Barry Lyndon, I am. As in most Kubrick films, the use of light is unbelievable. Almost every scene is so expertly and beautifully lit. Lighting is something you can usually ignore in a film, but after only a little examination of it in Barry Lyndon, you realise what a profound influence on the film it can have.
Kubrick wanted this film to be as faithful to the era as possible, so he ordered that all of the costumes be meticulously designed in complete accordance with not only the techniques of the period, but the fabrics. As a result, they no longer look like costumes, but like clothes - it's a big difference.Also to make the film seem realistic, Kubrick used only natural/candle light. It makes sense if you think about it. There was no electric light at the time, yet in all other period films, that's how everything is lit up (as opposed to how it actually looked). The difference is phenomenal (just think how different the light is in a lit room compared to outside in the daylight). As a result, the actors aren't mercislessly covered in light, but bask in it.In one scene, set in a large hall, the set is lit up exclusively by candles - from chandeliers, from along the walls, from on the tables). In such indoor scenes, you've probably never seen actors' faces lit by anything other than overhead electric lights. Here, they are lit from the side with a much softer, orange light, and the effect is surprisingly refreshing. Due to the lack of intense brightness that candles produce in such a large room, Kubrick had to specially modify his camera. He took a camera that had not been manufactured anymore for years, broke it apart, and got NASA (!!!) to modify it for him. The result was a camera that had an f-stop (I think it was f-stop) that was higher than any cameras being used even today! And this was all just for one few-minute-long scene! And this insane perfectionism had serious results! The use of music in this film is about as breathtaking as I've ever seen/heard in any film - And I'm not usually a big fan of classical music! One scene (a crescendo-ing sequence of scenes actually) is, because of the way it is fit with music, one of the most profound and beautiful scenes I've ever seen. Fans of Martin Scorsese might be interested to see Barry Lyndon, because - if I'm not mistaken - this is Scorsese's favourite film.",9,1,2,6 March 2002
Schindler's List," This goes beyond being just a bad film.
","As possibly the world's most influential film-maker, Spielberg has a responsibility. And that responsibility entails NOT using his cheesy, shallow sensibilities to turn one of the most profoundly horrible parts of human history into a soap opera-style piece of fluff. This film is more than just a bad film, it is a downright dangerously bad film that will be watched by millions of impressionable people who might have had few other sources to base their knowledge of the Holocaust on. Most of us agree that the worst thing to do about something like the Holocaust is to forget it, lest it happen again. The next worst thing is to trivialise it to the point where it resembles so many other Hollywood pieces of trash.What possesses a man who has become rich and powerful in the film industry solely through the making of shallow, transparent films for children to think that he is talented and wise enough to present to the masses a subject which should only be touched by the most careful and socially responsible hands? A Mid-life crisis, and an over-inflated ego, most likely, not that it matters though.Only someone with many years of study may be a doctor; only an experienced engineer may build a bridge, and even the guy who fixes your toilet must be a qualified plumber. Yet this fool, whose only previous qualifications have been cheap, shallow, movies made strictly for entertainment, thinks he is in a rightful position to educate our children. Because, unfortunately, many people have a frighteningly limited amount of knowledge about the second world war, and Schindler's List will be for many of them their main source of information. Showing it to them in as cheesy and hollow a fashion as almost only Spielberg can, is simply a crime.",1,455,948,7 March 2002
Mulholland Drive," Treat it like a dream...
","The first, and biggest, mistake to make while watching Mulholland Drive is undoubtedly the one that most viewers will make: To try and understand it. We've been force-fed linear, narrative, films with simple cause-and-effect plots so much that we find it almost inconceivable that a film could be made any other way. So when we see one that isn't, we think that the film-maker is confused, pretentious, or slack.   Most films are made predominantly for the intellect (this doesn't mean, of course, that most films are intelligent): to appreciate these films you have to use your mind. We are so used to mentally understanding films that many of us forget that there are other ways to understand things. For example, through intuition. Mulholland drive is a film that should be received with intuition. Treat it something like you would a dream.  Imagine that you've just had a strange, wondrous (or scary) dream that was full of bizarre things. There were some people in it that you know, but they weren't quite the same as they are in real life. Perhaps they were the same, but they looked like someone else. Other things in the dream were just plain unexplainable. One second you're in one place, then, without any reason, the next you're somewhere else. I won't go on, I'm sure you can remember many weird dreams you've had that were somewhat similar to this, and that left a deep impression on you. Well, when you wake up from one of these dreams, you don't say 'My God, what a stupid dream that was! It didn't make any bloody sense! Man, am I an idiot for having these dumb unrealistic dreams - why can't my dreams by like my everyday life, and not weird, illogical rubbish like that!!' I doubt many people say that after a truly strange and affecting, dream. I'm assuming that most people have a similar reaction to mine: they contemplate it in silence for a while, because it affected them. They can still FEEL the imprint of the dream in them. They can still remember, or even still feel, the various emotions that they were feeling. They go over it in their head and try and better comprehend it - but it belongs more in a sort of a netherworld than in the reality they are in when they wake up, so they'll never understand it fully. But they appreciate it nevertheless, glad that they had such a strange, interesting, and wondrous experience to start the day off with (if it was an unpleasant dream, then they're probably less glad, but not necessarily). And try explaining such a dream to someone else! You know it was such a fantastic dream, because you lived it, but anyone else just nods politely and says, 'yeah, well that does sound weird'. Because what you experienced wasn't just a bunch of ideas that you can simply put into words and tell someone else, it was more - you also experienced it through your emotions and your intuition.   Mulholland Drive, as Lost Highway was, is in many ways similar to a dream. The viewer who walks away saying that it was confused, pointless gibberish is the fool who has entirely missed the point - the fool who would wake up from a dream and complain that it was illogical.
  Similarly, the viewer who ponders it endlessly desperately trying to figure out exactly what every part of the film meant, trying to neatly package everything in a rational, ordered manner, is like the child trying to force the square-shaped block into the star-shaped hole.
  So, when you see this film, don't limit your experience by trying to understand it intellectually. Remember that there's more than one way to experience a film, and that some should be felt more than understood. By all means, think about the film and discuss it afterwards with friends, but don't listen to anyone that thinks they've got it all worked out, because they haven't (David Lynch himself says that he doesn't understand all of the mysteries in it  so how could anyone else?) . And if they spent so much time mentally battling with the film, trying to cognitively understand it, then they probably spent much less time feeling it and letting it simply overwhelm them. And their experience will be all the poorer for it. So don't you make that mistake, because you'll be passing up the opportunity of a pretty great, unique film experience.   ;)",9,1,2,6 March 2002
