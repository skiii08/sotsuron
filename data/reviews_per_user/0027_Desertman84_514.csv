The Devil's Advocate," John Grisham Mixed With Exorcist Stuff
","Supernatural forces hover over the courtroom in this devilish drama adapted from the novel by Andrew Neiderman entitled,The Devil's Advocate.It features Keanu Reeves,Al Pacino and Charlize Theron together with Jeffrey Jones,Judith Ivey,Connie Nielsen and Craig T. Nelson.It is directed by Taylor Hackford.Attorney Kevin Lomax doesn't heed the Bible-based warnings of his mother ,who views New York City as 'the dwelling place of demons.' Instead, he leaves Gainesville, Florida, with his wife Mary Ann to put his legalistic skills to the test at a leading Manhattan law firm run by John Milton. It all goes smoothly with Milton urging them to stay, putting Kevin on a $400-per-hour salary, and moving the couple into a luxurious apartment in his own building on Fifth Avenue where Mary Ann falls under the influence of neighbor Jackie. After Kevin defends a weird animal sacrificer, he moves up to an important case with an apparent murderer, real-estate tycoon Alexander Cullen. Ignored by Kevin, the troubled Mary Ann has some disturbing experiences, verging on the occult, while Kevin, at work, becomes attracted to redhead Christabella. Dazzled by his entrance into paradise, Kevin doesn't grasp who handed him this Big-Apple success.This is a highly enjoyable motion picture that's part character study, part supernatural thriller, and part morality play.Or it could be classified as film that is a John Grisham stuff clashed with the Exorcist stuff.The picture's most superlative turn comes from Charlize Theron, who's a revelation in the first role to really show off her talents.But nevertheless,it well-acted by Al Pacino and Keanu Reeves.Its greatest strength is that it becomes more complex and rewarding as it goes along.",9,7,7,15 October 2012
The King's Speech," The King's Speech Works In All Levels
","The King's Speech is a historical drama film.Colin Firth plays King George VI who, to cope with a stammer, sees Lionel Logue, an Australian speech therapist played by Geoffrey Rush. The men become friends as they work together, and after his brother abdicates the throne, the new King relies on Logue to help him make a radio broadcast on Britain's declaration of war on Germany during World War II.The Academy Award winner for Best Picture in 2010 was written by David Seidler directed by Tom Hooper.The King's Speech is based on the true story of King George VI.After the death of his father King George V and the scandalous abdication of King Edward VIII, Bertie who has suffered from a debilitating speech impediment all his life, is suddenly crowned King George VI of England. With his country on the brink of war and in desperate need of a leader, his wife, Elizabeth, the future Queen Mother, arranges for her husband to see an eccentric speech therapist, Lionel Logue. After a rough start, the two delve into an unorthodox course of treatment and eventually form an unbreakable bond. With the support of Logue, his family, his government and Winston Churchill, the King will overcome his stammer and deliver a radio-address that inspires his people and unites them in battle. The King's Speech is a humorous look at an ignored part of British history.Also,it features a great combination and chemistry between the odd partnership between delightful badinage between the recently-crowned King George VI and Lionel Logue,who happens to be his not-so-humble servant or suffice it to say a charming rogue.It allows the viewer to feel empathy towards the characters involved in the film.Credit that to the quality performances of the cast.Specially mention should be given to Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush,who portrayed King George VI and Logue respectively which allowed the movie to be absorbing and interesting.Also,the great screenplay and superb direction as well as the cinematography are excellent and outstanding.Given all the things mentioned such as the script,performances,acting,direction and cinematography,the movie works in all levels that makes this period drama truly a masterpiece.",10,1,2,4 November 2011
The Mask," A Perfect Vehicle For Jim Carrey
","The Mask is a fantasy comedy that is based on a series of comic books published by Dark Horse Comics. The film stars Jim Carrey as Stanley Ipkiss, a man who finds the Mask of Loki that turns him into The Mask, a trickster uninhibited by anything, including physical reality. The supporting cast includes Peter Greene as mafia officer Dorian Tyrell, Amy Yasbeck as a newspaper reporter, Peter Riegert and Jim Doughan as two police detectives, Richard Jeni as Stanley's friend, Orestes Matacena as nightclub owner and mafia boss Niko, Ben Stein as a psychologist, and Cameron Diaz in her feature film debut as Stanley's love interest Tina Carlyle.Hyperactive mayhem results when a mild-manned banker discovers an ancient mask that transforms him into a zany prankster with superhuman powers in this special-effects-intensive comedy.Stanley Ipkiss is a decent-hearted but socially awkward guy who one night finds a strange mask. Stanley puts on the mask and the banker transforms into The Mask, a green-skinned, zoot-suited fireball. The rubber-faced Mask possesses the courage to do the wild, fun things that Stanley fears, including romancing Tina Carlyle. The larger narrative, involving the efforts of Tina's gangster boyfriend to destroy Stanley and use the mask's powers for evil, prove less interesting than the anarchic comic set pieces.The film delivered enough laughs as it is a perfect vehicle for the talents of Jim Carrey wherein he seems to have found a story and character that work together with manic energy.In addition to his physical talents, the film makes effective use of digital visual effects that bestow the Mask with superhuman speed, insane flexibility, and popping eyes out of a Tex Avery cartoon.The design is bright as a button and the transformation scenes real eye-poppers, but the film's best special effect is putty-faced Carrey with his razzle-dazzle star turn as the affable Stanley and his manic alter ego.This makes it a marvelously energetic and highly enjoyable.",9,1,1,16 October 2012
Saturday Night Fever," A Dated Disco Movie
","Saturday Night Fever is a dance film directed by John Badham.It features John Travolta as Tony Manero, an immature young man whose weekends are spent visiting a local Brooklyn discothèque; Karen Lynn Gorney as his dance partner and eventual friend; and Donna Pescow as Tony's former dance partner and would-be girlfriend. Barry Miller,Paul Pape,Bruce Ornstein,Martin Shakar,Julie Bovasso and Fran Drescher play supporting roles.The story is conventional.Tony Manero is a Brooklyn paint-store clerk who'd give anything to break out of his dead-end existence. In life, Tony is a peasant; on the disco dance floor, he's a king. As the soundtrack plays one Bee Gees hit after another, we watch white-suited Tony strut his stuff amidst flashing lights and sweaty, undulating bodies. Tony's class aspirations are mirrored in his relationship with his dance partner, Stephanie, a secretary eager to move into the glamorous world of Manhattan. Saturday Night Fever's huge success grew meteorically thanks to the towering popularity of its soundtrack; during the first half of 1978, when the movie's disco songs saturated the singles charts up to four at a time, it was no longer clear whether the hit movie was feeding the hit songs or the hit songs were feeding the hit movie. This crossover between music and movies set the pace for many movies to come, as it also marked the rise and fall of 1970's disco culture.There's a lot in the movie that's sad and painful, but after a few years what you remember is John Travolta on the dance floor in that classic white disco suit, and the Bee Gees on the soundtrack.Obviously,one cannot dismiss its cultural significance, which today may be part of its campy appeal.Obviously,this is dated disco movie by today's standards.",7,1,3,1 October 2012
Moneyball," Moneyball Surprisingly Has Intelligence And Depth
","Moneyball is a sports drama film based on Michael Lewis's book of the same name which gives an account of the Oakland Athletics baseball team's 2002 season and their general manager's attempts to assemble a competitive team.It stars Brad Pitt,Jonah Hill and Philip Seymour Hoffman.Based on a true story,it is a movie for anybody who has ever dreamed of taking on the system. Brad Pitt plays Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland A's and the guy who assembles the team, who has an epiphany: all of baseball's conventional wisdom is wrong. Forced to reinvent his team on a tight budget, Beane will have to outsmart the richer clubs. The onetime jock teams with Ivy League grad Peter Brand in an unlikely partnership, recruiting bargain players that the scouts call flawed, but all of whom have an ability to get on base, score runs, and win games. The team's scouts are first dismissive of and then hostile towards Brand's non-traditional sabermetric approach to scouting players, most notably Grady Fuson – who is fired by Beane after insulting their approach, and takes to the radio airwaves and doubts the team's future. Rather than relying on the scouts' experience and intuition, Brand selects players based almost exclusively on their on base percentage (OBP). By finding players with a high OBP but with characteristics that lead scouts to dismiss them,Brand assembles a team of undervalued players with far more potential than the A's hamstrung finances would otherwise allow. Despite vehement objections from the scouts, Beane supports Brand's theory and hires the players he selected, such as unorthodox submarine pitcher Chad Bradford. Following the free agent signings, Beane finds that he also faces opposition from Art Howe, the Athletics' manager. With tensions already high between them because of a contract dispute, Howe disregards Beane and Brand's strategy and plays the team in a traditional style despite their unsuitability. Beane eventually trades away the lone traditional first baseman, Carlos Peña, to force Howe to use the new recruits.Early in the season, the Athletics fare poorly, leading critics within and outside the team to dismiss the new method as a dismal failure. Beane convinces the owner to stay the course, and eventually the team's record begins to improve. Ultimately, the Athletics win 20 consecutive games, setting the American League record. Their streak is capped with a victory over the Kansas City Royals. The movie is not a traditional sports movie, and indeed should be just as gripping for non-sports fans. It's not a series of Big Games. When it goes to the field, it's for well-chosen crucial moments. Its essence is in terse, brainy dialogue by the two accomplished screenwriters Aaron Sorkin and Steven Zaillian. As in 'The Social Network,' abstract discussions reflect deep emotional conflicts. There are a lot of laughs, but only one or two are inspired by lines intended to be funny. Instead, our laughter comes from recognition, an awareness of irony, an appreciation of perfect zingers — and, best of all, insights into human nature.This is really a movie about business. None of the individual players have major roles. The drama all happens in the mind of a general manager and his numbers guy. They bet against tradition and in favor of numerical analysis. That goes against a century of baseball history, although for all of those years, fans have thumbed through their baseball almanacs and issued mind-numbing statistical theories on talk shows. What the numbers crunchers demonstrated is that a computer can assemble a team better than human instinct.Finally,what is surprising about this movie is that it has intelligence and depth as it presents a man who is about to redeem himself from his past failures and overcome the present challenges and obstacles that he is currently facing in the achievement of his goals.",10,1,2,1 September 2012

Angels & Demons," Poor Adaptation Of The Novel
","Angels & Demons is a mystery-thriller film that was based on Dan Brown's novel by the same title. It is the Interquel or second film, although the book was published first in series chronology of Robert Langdon.The movie stars Tom Hanks,who reprises the lead role of Langdon,together with Ewan McGregor,Ayelet Zurer,Stellan Skarsgård,Pierfrancesco Favino,Nikolaj Lie Kaas and Armin Mueller-Stahl.Producer Brian Grazer, composer Hans Zimmer and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman and director Ron Howard also return after working in The Da Vinci Code.Angels & Demons,although was written before the novel The Da Vinci Code, the story transpires after the events of the latter movie.Robert Langdon, the most respected symbologist in the United States, who uses his knowledge in order to decode a symbol on the skin of a murder victim. The clues put him on the trail of an international conspiracy involving the Catholic Church.Inspite of the many issues involving about the Catholic Church,the movie was far from entertaining and interesting as compared to the novel itself.The film was more of an exercise instead of a story being told on screen. It was talky and a violent conspiracy thriller will bore not only kids and teens but adult viewers as well.It lacks tension,suspense and drama as everything in the movie becomes clichéd and predictable.Also,the story is far from realistic as it becomes ridiculous and implausible at some points of the screenplay.Acting-wise,it is noticeable that there is limited chemistry between Tom Hanks and Ayelet Zurer.I felt that even Hanks himself is on a rush delivering his lines as we see his character constantly chasing not only the enemy but as well as the exercise required by the plot of the movie.Too bad that it was a poor adaptation of a good novel.Maybe it is better to read the book instead of watching the movie adaptation.",8,1,2,30 November 2011

Budd calls Elle, offering to sell her The Bride's Hanzō sword, before sealing The Bride inside a coffin and burying her alive.In a flashback, Bill takes The Bride to the temple of Pai Mei,a legendary martial arts master. Pai Mei has mastered a technique wherein pressure points on the victim's chest are struck, leaving them with only a few footsteps before their death. Bill informs The Bride that Pai Mei teaches no one the technique.

To attract customers, she proposed a high-stakes match between the two most famous golfers of the day, Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen.Local businessmen sponsoring the match insist that a local golfer be added to the card, and Junuh is drafted for the position, but it soon becomes obvious that his game is just a shadow of its former glory. When things seem hopeless, a mysterious gentleman named Bagger Vance volunteers to serve as Junuh's caddy and coach, using a mixture of ancient wisdom and past- life knowledge to help Junah 'remember' the swing he's lost. Jack Lemmon,in his final film,provides narration in the movie.Although a lot of the critics hated the film due to the performances are hindered by an inadequate screenplay full of flat characters and bad dialogue as well as how it glosses over issues of racism,it manages to be a good view.Will Smith shows skill and subtlety in his ludicrous role as Bagger Vance. With regards to the production design,the visuals were superior as well.Although it may turn off some viewers,this is still an above average film as the talent involved makes this material worth the viewer's time for entertainment and satisfaction.",9,1,2,31 December 2011

Elster's wife, Madeleine, has been possessed by a spirit, and Elster wants Scottie to follow her. He hesitantly agrees, and thus begins the film's wordless montage as Scottie follows the beautiful yet enigmatic Madeleine through 1950s San Francisco. After saving her from suicide, Scottie begins to fall in love with her, and she appears to feel the same way. Here tragedy strikes, and each twist in the movie's second half changes our preconceptions about the characters and events. The movie is definitely a masterpiece.It involves the viewer deeply into it especially with themes of erotic obsession.Also,Alfred Hitchcock's twisty,suspenseful and tension-filled tale is far involving and engaging that one may get absorbed into the story and the characters involved.This only proves he is genius in his craft and film making.And most of all,it has one unpredictable story that one can't see far before the final credits roll. The performances of the talented cast are definitely excellent and outstanding.Added to that,the musical score was written by Bernard Herrmann provides a haunting theme that elevates the drama way above the level of an already great masterpiece.Overall,Vertigo creates a cinema landmark of excellence that only the likes of The Godfather can probably match or surpass.",10,2,4,31 October 2011

But Nina has competition: a new dancer played by Mila Kunis,Lily impresses Leroy as well. Swan Lake requires a dancer who can play both the White Swan with innocence and grace, and the Black Swan, who represents guile and sensuality. Nina fits the White Swan role perfectly but Lily is the personification of the Black Swan. When the two compete for the parts, Nina finds a dark side to herself.As the two young dancers expand their rivalry into a twisted friendship, Nina begins to get more in touch with her dark side - a recklessness that threatens to destroy her.Black Swan's theme picks at our deepest anxieties as it relates to the emotions felt by Nina like injury, disfigurement, loss of a coveted job, loss of identity and even loss of sanity.It shows how she tries to cope up with them and how it even threatens her very own life as if danger lurks in her shadows.Aside from that,it also shows how a person is severely affected by a fear of failure.The film could be maddening to viewers but nevertheless it would be both enriching on how people deal with severe pressure as well as fears and anxieties in life especially when one is tested to the fullest in terms of strength and character.Aside from that,it is a movie that is entertaining as well as we see Portman portrays Nina with passion and confusion of a repressed woman who feels the very emotions of delirium that continually haunts her as well as her strange hallucinations and visions pushes her to the limit.Overall,the film is one of the best not only due to Afronsky's direction and Portman's performance but also to the dark themes that are presented in this film that are not often seen in many movies.",10,2,3,26 October 2011

When she forces him aboard the 'Queen Anne's Revenge,' the ship of the legendary pirate Blackbeard, Jack finds himself on an unexpected adventure in which he doesn't know whom to fear more: Blackbeard or Angelica, with whom he shares a mysterious past. The film is shorter and leaner than the previous film of the series,Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End; but it runs aground on a disjointed plot and a non-stop barrage of noisy action sequences.There is fun to be had and it's exciting to see Captain Jack Sparrow on the big screen again but the overall production suffers from franchise burnout despite the presence of Penelope Cruz and the fine performance of Ian McShane.",8,1,3,21 October 2012
Scarface," A Classic Gangster Film
","Scarface is a crime film that features that tells the story of a Cuban refugee who comes to Miami who becomes a drug cartel kingpin during the cocaine boom of the said decade.Al Pacino stars as Tony Montana together with Steven Bauer,Michelle Pfeiffer,Robert Loggia and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. Oliver Stone wrote the screenplay and Brian De Palma directed the movie which was an update of the 1932 classic of the same title that was written by Ben Hecht and directed by Howard Hawks.Tony Camonte, the Italian-American Chicago gangster in the 1932 classic, is now called Tony Montana.He is a small-time Cuban punk, one of supposedly hundreds among the 125,000 or so legitimate refugees that the Castro Government allowed to immigrate to Florida in the spring of 1980. Quick- witted, hollow-eyed Tony Montana hasn't one redeeming feature, but his greed and ambition are so all-consuming that they are heroic in size if not in quality.He has absolutely no compunction about murdering for profit, which quickly endears him to a Batista Cuban refugee who is the chief of the Bolivia-to-Florida cocaine traffic,later works his way up and succeeds his former mentor.He,too marries the now-dead man's mistress, Elvira.This is one of the best gangster films ever made.It's cool, it's violent, it's scary and it's unforgettable.It's a whole new spin on the immigrant story and the American Dream as an underworld nightmare as it tells the rise and fall of an immigrant who has chosen to engage in criminal activities. The façade of family loyalty, underworld authority and the mob code is trampled in the feral battle to get to the top of the cocaine mountain as the Tony Montana character robs and murders his way to riches and power, and then numbs himself into a fantasy of invulnerability with his own product.The performances in this film was excellent in this film.Al Pacino does not make Montana into a sympathetic character, but he does make him into somebody we can identify with, in a horrified way.Also,it has a wonderful gallery of excellent supporting cast: Steven Bauer as a sidekick, Michelle Pfeiffer as a woman whose need for drugs leads her from one wrong lover to another, Robert Loggia as a mob boss who isn't quite vicious enough, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, as Pacino's kid sister who wants the right to self-destruct in the manner of her own choosing.And most of all,it is a movie that understands crime personality for it portrays laziness and ruthlessness, grandiosity and low self-esteem, pipe dreams and a chronic inability to be happy inspite of being abundantly wealthy.",10,1,3,19 August 2013

It is a historical drama film dramatizes the Frost/Nixon interviews of 1977.It stars Michael Sheen Frost and Frank Langella as former President Nixon.At the time Nixon sat down with Frost to discuss the sordid details that ultimately derailed his presidency, it had been three years since the former commander in chief had been forced out of office in '77. The Watergate scandal was still fresh in everyone's minds, and he had remained notoriously tight-lipped until he agreed to sit down with Frost. Nixon was certain that he could hold his own opposite the up-and- coming British broadcaster, and even Frost's own people weren't quite sure their boss was ready for such a high-profile interview. When the interview ultimately got under way and each man eschewed the typical posturing in favor of the simple truth, fans and critics on both sides were stunned by what they witnessed. Instead of Nixon stonewalling the interviewer as expected, or Frost lobbing softballs as the truth-seekers feared, what emerged was an unguardedly honest exchange between a man who had lost everything and another with everything to gain.At the time Nixon sat down with Frost to discuss the sordid details that ultimately derailed his presidency, it had been three years since the former commander in chief had been forced out of office.

Nixon was certain that he could hold his own opposite the up-and-coming British broadcaster, and even Frost's own people weren't quite sure their boss was ready for such a high-profile interview. When the interview ultimately got under way and each man eschewed the typical posturing in favor of the simple truth, fans and critics on both sides were stunned by what they witnessed. Instead of Nixon stonewalling the interviewer as expected, or Frost lobbing softballs as the truth-seekers feared, what emerged was an unguardedly honest exchange between a man who had lost everything and another with everything to gain. The film excels in recreating that landmark interview and the behind- the-scenes look at the power struggles between the two people.Also,it tells us how the former president was able to come up with memorable quotes such as 'When the President does it,that means it's not illegal' through the British broadcaster's interviewing skills.Also,Ron Howard succeeds in providing interest to the viewer in a rather mundane,ordinary and not-so-interesting interview that makes the movie engaging,absorbing and worth watching. With respect to the performances of the actors,Langella excels in not mimicking the former president but rather in trying to bring the his natural personality and demeanor. In summary,Frost/Nixon succeeds in providing an unlikely tension and suspense in an unforgettable event.",10,3,4,31 October 2011
Howl's Moving Castle," A Great Japanese Anime
","Hayao Miyazaki, the Japanese animation director who wowed audiences worldwide with his award-winning film Spirited Away, brings another visually spectacular tale of imagination to the screen in this animated fantasy film entitled,Howl's Moving Castle.It was released in its original Japanese and in a dubbed English version with the voice cast that includes Christian Bale, Emily Mortimer, Jean Simmons, Lauren Bacall, and Billy Crystal.It was written and directed by Miyazaki of Studio Ghibli and based on the novel of the same title by Diana Wynne Jones.Sophie is an 18-year-old girl who toils in the hat shop opened years ago by her late father.

Walk the Line," Joaquin Phoenix And Reese Witherspoon Makes This A Great Movie
","Walk the Line is a biographical musical drama that is based on the early life and career of country music artist Johnny Cash. The story focuses on his early life,his first family with Vivian Cash,his romance with June Carter and his rise to stardom as a country singer.It was based on numerous autobiographies.It features Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon in the leading roles as Johnny Cash and June Carter respectively.James Mangold co-wrote the screenplay and directed the film.The story includes Johnny Cash's childhood wherein he experienced his battering from his abusive father and tragedy after his brother's accidental death.Then we also witness his troubled first marriage with his first wife due to his financial and emotional instability.As a country singer,we get to see his ascent into stardom in the music scene. As his fame grew,he struggled with amphetamines,barbiturates and alcoholism.But upon meeting June Carter,it helped him overcome those struggles and her support provided him more success later in his career.This was definitely a great film due to the performances of both Phoenix and Witherspoon as they give us first rate work.Although the screenplay may be a boring and slow at times,we are definitely treated to an acting extravaganza.Both performers were able to capture what Johnny Cash and June Carter are all about and their devotion to each other definitely provided lots of intrigue to the movie in spite of their supposed personal weaknesses and life struggles.Also worth mentioning is the music played in the story as it allows us to hear the popular songs and remind us of the performances of both country music legends.These are two reasons why Walk The Line deserves the highest rating.",10,1,1,16 July 2014
The Incredible Hulk," Edward Norton Is Wonderful As The Hulk

The Monuments Men," The Monuments Men Could Have Been Better
","The Monuments Men is a war film that is loosely based on the non-fiction book entitled The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History which was written by Robert M. Edsel. It stars George Clooney and Matt Damon together with Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Bob Balaban, Hugh Bonneville, and Cate Blanchett. The story is about the Monuments Men,an Allied group of soldiers that is assigned of finding and gathering the pieces of art and other culturally important items that were stolen by the Nazis.They are running against time as Adolph Hitler intends its destruction during World War II.It was produced,written and directed by Clooney.The Monuments Men is unlikely Allied group platoon.They were tasked by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to rescue missing art masterpieces from Nazi thieves at Germany to be able to return them to their rightful owners.It was deemed to be an impossible mission as they are trapped behind enemy lines and were ordered to be destroyed by Hitler.Added to that,the men are only made up of seven museum directors, curators, and art historians.Will they succeed in doing it at the end?The movie has an interesting premise as we get to see another Allied group with an unlikely mission.Also,we have a talented cast starring in it.Unfortunately,the screenplay needs a lot of improvement as it was both sluggish and uneven.The viewer would find it confusing too on what its tone whether it is a drama,comedy,action,a war film or a character- driven film as well as it became somewhat more about the men in the group rather than their mission.With this tonal confusion,one may find it boring too as there seems to be a lack of urgency among the group to recover the missing art masterpieces as soon as possible. The only thing that I like is the commitment of the characters and the theme of the movie of providing importance to the arts the defined man's thousand of years of of culture and the preservation of their greatest achievements.Finally,it also provided the viewer some lessons in art history. It was just too bad that the movie cold have been better if the screenplay was written better.",8,1,2,8 June 2014
Miracle," Do you believe in miracles? Yes!
","Miracle is an inspiring story of the team that transcended its sport and united a nation with a new feeling of hope. Gavin O'Connor directs this sports drama, based on the true story of the U.S. Hockey Team at the 1980 Winter Olympics at Lake Placid. Kurt Russell stars as hockey coach the late Herb Brooks,who assembles a U.S. team of underdogs.Also starring Eddie Cahill,Noah Emmerich and Patricia Clarkson.Based on the true story of one of the greatest moments in sports history, the tale captures a time and place where differences could be settled by games and a cold war could be put on ice. In 1980, the United States Ice Hockey team's coach, Herb Brooks, took a ragtag squad of college kids up against the legendary juggernaut from the Soviet Union at the Olympic Games.Nobody thinks the US Team can make it,as they are up against the previously undefeated Soviet Union hockey team. Despite the odds, Brooks leads the U.S. team to victory. As the 1980 Winter Olympics happen to coincide with the Cold War,the event is interpreted as patriotic. Despite the long odds, Team USA carried the pride of a nation yearning from a distraction from world events. While everyone knows the expected outcome of this movie especially to those who knew about what happened at Lake Placid in 1980,the film was still effective primarily due to Kurt Russell's performance as Brooks.Aside from that,the movie did well on dwelling on the team's preparations and its character development instead of the games they played in the Olympics.Aside from Russell,special mention in the performances also goes to Eddie Cahill as Jim Craig. Overall,the movie's story is an inspirational one especially to those viewers who feel down in their lives. This film will definitely echo the feeling of what ABC broadcaster Al Michael said when the US beat the Soviets,'Do you believe in miracles? Yes!'",10,1,1,22 October 2011
Mission: Impossible III," Mission Impossible III:Falls Short Compared To The First Two Movies
","Mission: Impossible III is the third installment of the spy-themed movie series Mission:Impossible starring Tom Cruise,who once again reprises his role of spy agent Ethan Hunt.The film was directed by J. J. Abrams,his first film as a director. The plot has Ethan Hunt retired as a team leader at the IMF.He has settled into training new recruits while settling down with his fiancée Julia (Michelle Monaghan),who is unaware of Ethan's past. At a party, he is approached by his fellow IMF agent John Musgrave (Billy Crudup),who secretly relays a mission to him: to rescue one of Ethan's protégés, Lindsey Farris (Keri Russell).She was captured while on a mission to investigate the infamous black market dealer Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Musgrave has already prepared a team for him, consisting of Declan Gormley (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), Zhen Lei (Maggie Q), and his old partner Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), ready to meet him in Berlin. It soon becomes evident that Davian is well-protected, well-connected, and downright malicious as his wife got kidnapped in the process. This forces Hunt to extend his journey back into the field in order to rescue his wife, Julia, and uncover IMF double agents in the process. I personally felt that the third Mission Impossible has fallen short as compared to the first two.I have to take into consideration for one that this happens to be J.J. Abram's first film.Aside from that,there are less quality acting in this film even with the presence of Philip Seymour Hoffman,who seems more like playing in his role as a villain. Finally,there is nothing spectacular in this third installment of Mission Impossible except for Cruise reprising his character as the world-famous IMF agent.",1,2,4,10 October 2011
Requiem for a Dream," An American Masterpiece
","No question that Requiem For A Dream,which stars Ellen Burstyn,Jared Leto,Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans, is an American cinema masterpiece.It is the ultimate film about drugs and its effects in a human being's body and soul. The film is based on the novel of the same name by Hubert Selby, Jr.The film depicts different forms of addiction, leading to the characters' imprisonment in a world of delusion and reckless desperation that is subsequently overtaken and devastated by reality.The film charts three seasons in the lives of Sara Goldfarb,her son Harry,Harry's girlfriend Marion Silver, and Harry's friend Tyrone C. Love.The story begins in summer; Sara Goldfarb, an elderly widow living alone in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, spends her time watching infomercials hosted by Tappy Tibbons. After a phone call announces that she will be invited to be a participant on a game show, she becomes obsessed with regaining the youthful appearance she possesses in a photograph from Harry's graduation, her proudest moment. In order to fit into her old red dress, the favorite of her deceased husband Seymour, she begins taking a regimen of prescription weight-loss amphetamine pills throughout the day and a sedative at night. Despite Harry's warnings about amphetamine addiction, she passionately insists that the chance to be on television has given her a reason to live. When her invitation does not arrive over the fall, she increases her dosage but begins suffering from amphetamine psychosis and having delusions of reference, hallucinating that she is the principal subject of the game show and that her refrigerator is a menacing, living monster.Harry is a heroin addict; together with fellow addicts Tyrone and Marion, he enters the illegal drug trade around Coney Island in an attempt to realize their dreams. With the money they make over the summer, Harry and Marion hope to open a fashion store for Marion's designs, while Tyrone dreams of making his mother proud by escaping the street. However, at the beginning of fall, Tyrone is caught in the middle of a drug gang assassination, and Harry must use most of their money to post bail. Increasing drug-related violence and arrests begin making it hard to obtain drugs, throwing Harry, Tyrone, and Marion into a state of deprivation. Growing more desperate, Harry convinces Marion to have sex with her psychiatrist in exchange for money, causing a rift in the relationship. Meanwhile, Harry's arm is becoming infected from unsanitary injection techniques.As Sara's sanity unravels, she takes the subway to visit the television studio in Manhattan. The secretary at the studio calls a hospital and Sara is involuntarily committed to a psychiatric ward where she undergoes unsuccessful medicative treatment, followed by electro convulsive therapy. Harry and Tyrone set out for Florida to obtain drugs, but Harry's increasingly infected arm forces them to visit a hospital in South Carolina, where they are arrested for skipping bail. Tyrone must deal with hard labor, racist prison guards and drug withdrawal, as Harry is taken to a prison hospital to have his arm amputated. Harry has a recurring dream of Marion waiting for him at a pier at Coney Island, but awakens and realizes that he is alone in jail with just one arm. Back in New York, Marion meets with a pimp 'Little John', who gives her drugs in exchange for sex and puts her in sex shows at his apartment suite to provide for her drug habit.Lost in misery, each character curls into a fetal position. In Sara's dream, she wins the game show's grand prize and meets Harry there. In her fantasy, Harry is a successful businessman and engaged to Marion. Sara and Harry hug and say how much they love one another through the cheers of the crowd and the glowing stage lights.No doubt,this is one of the best films ever made in Hollywood.It examines how drugs affects the very being of the each person as explored in the main characters of the film.Although this is far from a traditional film that intends to entertain the viewer,it nevertheless presents its theme in its most powerful way possible.Aside from that,the performances of the actors/actresses are powerful especially Burstyn,who no less deserves her Oscar nomination.",10,2,3,16 October 2011
Captain Phillips," Tom Hanks Delivers A Great Performance As Captain Phillips
","Captain Phillips is based on the true story of the hijack of the Maersk Alabama by Somali pirates.This incident led to merchant mariner,Captain Richard Phillips,being taken hostage in the Indian Ocean by Abduwali Muse and his crew.It stars Tom Hanks as Phillips together with Abduwali Muse,Catherine Keener,Faysal Ahmed,Michael Chernus and David Warshofsky. The account was taken from the book,A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALs, and Dangerous Days at Sea,written by by Phillips himself together with Stephan Talty.Paul Greengrass was the director at the helm in it. The film focuses on the relationship between the Alabama's commanding officer, Captain Phillips and the Somali pirate captain, Muse during the hostage incident.Both are set on an unstoppable collision course when Muse and his crew target Phillips' unarmed ship.In the ensuing standoff as well as that of the US Navy and the Somali pirates,all find themselves at the mercy of each other.It ends when the three SEAL marksmen finally get three clear shots and simultaneously kill the pirates as Phillips was about to be executed by his hostage takers.The final scenes reveal Muse is taken into custody and arrested for piracy while Phillips is rescued and treated.While critics and many reviewers found this film to be a masterpiece,I myself saw many flaws in it.The scenes between the US Navy and the Somalian pirates particularly when it comes to negotiations with Captain Phillips somewhats undermine the Navy's skill in handling the situation considering that the Somalian pirates are not that knowledgeable and could be deemed as inferior opponents.The amount of time they needed and the excessive manpower used against 4 Somalian pirates before managing to save Phillips could be described somewhat more of an embarrassment and viewers may find themselves asking the Navy's capability in rescue operations.Aside from that,the constant shaking of the camera is found to be a distraction while watching it.Added to that,the tension of the film decreases and the viewer may become impatient as the film ends especially at the point when Phillips tried to escape his captors and too much Navy manpower are rendered clueless in dealing with the Somalians and the empathy for Phillips decreases at a certain point of the film.But despite of the negative things I have said,I felt that Tom Hanks delivered a wonderful performance and was able to overcome the things that I have mentioned in watching this film.He definitely provided one great performance and he exhibited range which he has never shown in his previous movies.Also,we get to see great acting by Barkhad Abdi.Overall,I would consider it one good movie but far from a masterpiece that garnered many Academy Award nominations with possible exceptions to the performances Hanks and Abdi.",9,1,2,23 May 2014
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Phantom Menace: Lacks The Heart Of The Original
","In 1977, George Lucas released Star Wars, the ultimate sci-fi popcorn flick-turned-pop-culture myth machine. It quickly became the biggest money-making film of all time and changed the shape of the film industry. After two successful sequels that extended the story of the first film, Lucas took some time off to produce movies for others, with mixed success. In 1999, Lucas returned to the Star Wars saga with a new approach -- instead of picking up where Return of the Jedi left off, Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace would be the first of a trilogy of stories to trace what happened in the intergalactic saga before the first film began.Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace is a space film written and directed by George Lucas. It is the fourth film to be released in the Star Wars saga, as the first of a three-part prequel to the original Star Wars trilogy, as well as the first film in the saga in terms of story chronology. The Phantom Menace was also Lucas' first product as a film director after 22 years, and only his fourth overall with the Star Wars films.Here, Obi-Wan Kenobi is a young apprentice Jedi knight under the tutelage of Qui-Gon Jinn; Anakin Skywalker, who will later father Luke Skywalker and become known as Darth Vader, is just a nine-year-old boy. When the Trade Federation cuts off all routes to the planet Naboo, Qui- Gon and Obi-Wan are assigned to settle the matter, but when they arrive on Naboo they are brought to Amidala, the Naboo queen, by a friendly but opportunistic Gungan named Jar Jar. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan plan to escort Amidala to a meeting of Republic leaders in Coruscant, but trouble with their spacecraft strands them on the planet Tatooine, where Qui-Gon meets Anakin, the slave of a scrap dealer. Qui-Gon is soon convinced that the boy could be the leader the Jedis have been searching for, and he begins bargaining for his freedom and teaching the boy the lessons of the Force. Despite a shaky start and the presence of questionable elements throughout, by the time it arrives at its finale The Phantom Menace has won its place alongside the original Star Wars trilogy.The special effects are some of the most dazzling and amazing ever seen on the big screen. In addition, the acting is excellent.Although the visuals are indeed eye-popping, the viewer may find no vested emotional tie to either story or characters which makes it fall short from the other Star Wars film.It simply lacks a lot of the heart the original series embraced.But despite of its setbacks,this movie still is a great view since it will provide great entertainment and satisfaction.",9,2,5,14 January 2012
3:10 to Yuma," Remake Improved By Great Performances By Crowe And Bale
","3:10 to Yuma is a remake of the 1957 western film that stars Russell Crowe and Christian Bale together with Peter Fonda and Gretchen Mol.It was the second adaptation of Elmore Leonard's short story of the title that tells a story about a desperado whose accomplices stage an ambush after he is taken into custody by a determined local sheriff.James Mangold directed the remake.After watching the original film that stars Glenn Ford and Van Heflin,one will definitely notice that there is nothing new added to this remake as it stays true to the conventions and to the story.But what makes it great is the fact that the improvement of the characters and the performances of the cast made it worth watching.An extremely cocky desperado Ben Wade,portrayed excellently by Crowe and a nervous but gritty rancher Dan Evans,played magnificently by Bale made it worth watching.Despite the fact that western films aren't no longer the 'thing' unlike in the 50's,the added complexities of the two main characters and the entertainment it provides made it worth watching.Credit also should be given to Mangold for his excellent direction as it had an interesting story and the themes on moral complexity was tackled upon effectively.It definitely was an update of Western film just like Unforgiven.",10,2,2,2 July 2014

Ali," A Good Film About The Greatest
","Ali is a biographical film that film tells the story of the boxer Muhammad Ali, played by Will Smith, from 1964 to 1974. Michael Mann directs.The story features the following events:his capture of the heavyweight title from Sonny Liston;his conversion to Islam; criticism of the Vietnam War; banishment from boxing; his return to the ring against Joe Frazier in 1971;and when he won once again the heavyweight title by taking it by upsetting George Foreman in 1974.When a filmmaker decides to make a film on Ali,who considers himself The Greatest,one must also expect the greatest film to be made about him.Unfortunately,it does not meet those standards.Despite the fact that Will Smith was able to capture the persona of The Greatest and willed himself to be Muhammad Ali,the script is far from being engaging.It is more concerned about details of the events of his life that it serves like a documentary rather than an entertaining film about the champ.Added to that,the viewer does not get to know the man more while watching it as the viewer is treated to a very long film more about the events that happened rather than the giving us the glimpse of the most charismatic boxer who had fun with his fame when he was the most known athlete of the world.",9,1,4,6 August 2013

Catch Me If You Can," A Teen-age Con Man
","A gifted forger and confidence man attempts to stay one step ahead of the lawman determined to bring him to justice in this comedy-drama from Steven Spielberg, based on a true story in this film entitled,Catch Me If You Can.It is a biographical comedy-drama film based on the life of Frank Abagnale, Jr., who, before his 19th birthday, successfully performed cons worth millions of dollars by posing as a Pan American World Airways pilot, a Georgia doctor, and a Louisiana parish prosecutor. His primary crime was check fraud; he became so skillful that the FBI eventually turned to him for help in catching other check forgers.It stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Abagnale and Tom Hanks along with Christopher Walken, Amy Adams, Martin Sheen, and Nathalie Baye.Frank W. Abagnale Jr. is a 16-year-old high school student who finds himself emotionally cut adrift when his mother, Paula, leaves his father, Frank Abagnale Sr., after Frank Sr. falls into arrears with the Internal Revenue Service. One day at school, Frank Jr. attempts to pass himself off as a substitute teacher, and easily makes the subterfuge work. His small-scale success gives Frank some ideas, and he soon discovers bigger and more profitable ways of hoaxing others, passing himself off as an airline pilot, a doctor, and an attorney. Along the way, Frank learns how to become a master forger, and uses his talent and charm to pass over 2.5 million dollars in phony checks. Frank's increasingly audacious work soon attracts the attention of Carl Hanratty , an FBI agent who is determined to put Frank behind bars. Frank seems to enjoy being pursued by Carl, and even goes so far as to call Carl on the phone to chat every once in a while. While posing as a doctor, Frank falls in love with Brenda Strong, a sweet girl working as a candy striper. When Frank asks Brenda to marry him, he decides to assume a new identity to impress her father, Roger -- who happens to be the District Attorney of New Orleans, LA.The scene then flashes forward to a plane returning Frank home from prison, where Carl informs him that his father has died. Consumed with grief, Frank escapes from the plane and goes back to his old house, where he finds his mother with the man she left his father for, as well as a girl that Frank realizes is his half- sister. Frank gives himself up and is sentenced to 12 years in prison, getting visits from time to time from Carl. When Frank points out how one of the checks Carl is carrying as evidence is fake, Carl convinces the FBI to offer Frank a deal by which he can live out the remainder of his sentence working for the bank fraud department of the FBI, to which Frank accepts. While working at the FBI, Frank misses the thrill of the chase and even attempts to fly as an airline pilot again. He is cornered by Carl, who insists that Frank will return to the FBI job since no one is chasing him.On the following Monday, Carl is nervous that Frank has not yet appeared at work. However, Frank finally shows up and they discuss their next case.The ending credits reveal that Frank has been happily married for 26 years, has three sons, lives in the Midwest, is still good friends with Carl, has caught some of the world's most elusive money forgers, and earns millions of dollars each year because of his work creating unforgeable checks.Steven Spielberg turns in another hit, with help from a strong performance by Leonardo DiCaprio, in this stylish, breezily entertaining, and surprisingly sweet story of real-life wunderkind con artist Frank Abagnale.It was a gently funny, sweetly adventurous film that makes you feel genuinely good, that is to say, entirely unconned by false sentiment or sharp, overmanipulative Hollywood practices.Also,it was an excellent account of FBI's youngest Most Wanted.In summary,the movie works at all levels.",10,2,4,9 January 2012

Ghost," Ghost Is A Timeless Romantic Crowd Pleaser
","Ghost is a commercially successfully movie that features Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore and Whoopi Goldberg together with Tony Goldwyn,Rick Aviles, Stephen Root, and Vincent Schiavelli.Blending comedy, romance, action, and horror, Ghost was a box-office smash and managed to garner five Academy Award nominations, including 'Best Picture,' 'Best Supporting Actress' (Goldberg), 'Best Original Screenplay,' 'Best Editing,' and 'Best Score'; Goldberg won her first Oscar. It was written by Bruce Joel Rubin and directed by Jerry Zucker.The plot involves an interesting hybrid of popular film genres as it showcases the talents of its entire cast. While out on the town one evening, New York couple Sam and Molly are confronted by a mugger. After submitting to his demands, Sam is murdered anyway. He then finds himself a disembodied spirit, invisible to the living world, wandering without hope until he finds a spiteful spirit aboard the subway who gives him some helpful pointers on how to co-exist. Soon Sam comes back into contact with those he knew in life, and he begins to learn piece-by- piece of his close friend and co-worker Carl's embezzling plot which caused his death; the apparent mugging was, in fact, a premeditated murder. In the meantime, Carl has designs on Molly, and Sam is determined to extract revenge. He contacts a psychic, and together, the two set out to serve justice and stop the maniacal Carl from getting to Molly.This is a timeless romantic film that also relies on the supernatural aside from its many genres to entertain that viewers particularly the lovers and hopeless romantics.It maybe corny and superficial but nevertheless,it contains some nice ideas and nice whole moments at a time, succeeds in evoking the mysteries that the the screenplay deals with.The cast succeeds quite nicely in unifying the movie's multiple personalities especially the leads - Swayze,Moore and Goldberg - that generates a lot of interest from beginning to end.But despite of its somewhat predictable and formulaic plot,the movie succeeds due to the sincerity rarely evoked by the movie and the way it manages to please the viewer.",9,1,2,14 December 2011
The Ring," Scary With A Great Story
","The Ring is a psychological horror film that stars Naomi Watts and Martin Henderson together with David Dorfman,Daveigh Chase,Brian Cox, Jane Alexander,Lindsay Frost,Amber Tamblyn,Rachael Bella and Shannon Cochran.The movie was a remake of the Japanese horror film Ring. It is based on Koji Suzuki's novel Ring and focuses on a mysterious cursed videotape which contains a seemingly random series of disturbing images. After watching the tape, the viewer receives a phone call in which a girl's voice announces that the viewer will die in seven days.

A handful of teenagers who watched the tape while spending a weekend at a cabin in the mountains scoff at the threat, but as predicted, they all die suddenly on the same night. Rachel Keller, the aunt of one of the ill-fated teens, is a journalist who has decided to investigate the matter and travels West with her young son, Aidan, a troubled child who has been drawing pictures of strange and ominous visions. Rachel managed to find the cabin in the woods and watches the video herself; afterward, she receives the same phone call, and realizes she must solve the puzzle of the video and the person or persons behind it within a week. Rachel turns to her ex, Noah, an expert in video technology, who at first is convinced the story is a hoax until he digs deeper into the mystery.The Ring is a horror movie made not only to scare the viewer in front of their TV screen but it also has a story to tell.The creepy exploration of the unknown and unexplained is far more frightening than the violent killings that typify most horror films.Also,brilliant acting was prominent in the movie as the characters involved have depth.The visuals were also effective as it will definitely put somebody at the edge of one's seat.Overall,The Ring is one scary movie with a great story.",10,1,1,10 November 2011
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Raiders of the Lost Ark:One Of The Most Entertaining Adventure Film Ever Made
","Raiders of the Lost Ark is an action-adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg, produced by George Lucas, and starring Harrison Ford. It is the first film in the Indiana Jones franchise. It pits Indiana Jones against a group of Nazis who search for the Ark of the Covenant because Adolf Hitler believes it will make their army invincible. The film co- stars Karen Allen as Indiana's former lover, Marion Ravenwood; Paul Freeman as Indiana's nemesis, French archaeologist René Belloq; John Rhys-Davies as Indiana's sidekick, Sallah; and Denholm Elliott as Indiana's colleague, Marcus Brody.Indiana Jones is no ordinary archaeologist. When we first see him, he is somewhere in the Peruvian jungle in 1936, running a booby-trapped gauntlet to fetch a solid-gold idol. He loses this artifact to his chief rival, a French archaeologist named Belloq, who then prepares to kill our hero. In the first of many serial-like escapes, Indy eludes Belloq by hopping into a convenient plane. So, then: is Indiana Jones afraid of anything? Yes, snakes. The next time we see Jones, he's a soft-spoken, bespectacled professor. He is then summoned from his ivy-covered environs by Marcus Brody to find the long-lost Ark of the Covenant. The Nazis, it seems, are already searching for the Ark, which the mystical- minded Hitler hopes to use to make his stormtroopers invincible. But to find the Ark, Indy must first secure a medallion kept under the protection of Indy's old friend Abner Ravenwood, whose daughter, Marion (Karen Allen), evidently has a 'history' with Jones. Whatever their personal differences, Indy and Marion become partners in one action- packed adventure after another, ranging from wandering the snake pits of the Well of Souls to surviving the pyrotechnic unearthing of the sacred Ark.A joint project of Hollywood prodigies George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, with a script co-written by Lawrence Kasdan and Philip Kaufman, among others, Raiders of the Lost Ark is not so much a movie as a 115-minute thrill ride.But this is the kind of movie that, even today, audiences immediately fall in love with. It has all the right ingredients: a smart script, a likable hero, a dash of romance, more than a touch of comedy, and a lot of fast-paced action.Also,it is one of the most deliriously funny, ingenious and stylish American adventure movies ever made.Added to that,the commercially successful film holds up as a spectacle film, spooky fun house ride and rollicking adventure yarn. Steven Spielberg was, then and now, the finest director of grand-scale Hollywood blockbusters.Obviously,it is one of the most indelible adventure films in cinematic history.",10,1,2,14 January 2012
Deja Vu," A Fun Ride
","Déjà Vu is an action thriller film with elements of crime and science fiction.It stars Denzel Washington together with Val Kilmer, Bruce Greenwood, Matt Craven, Jim Caviezel, Adam Goldberg, and Paula Patton. The screenplay involves ATF agent Douglas Carlin, who travels back in time in attempts to prevent a domestic terrorist attack that takes place in New Orleans and to save Claire Kuchever, with whom he falls in love.It was written by Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio.And,it was directed by Tony Scott.New Orleans-based maverick ATF agent named Doug Carlin is brought in on a top-secret government program to catch the terrorist that is responsible for a ferry bombing that kills hundreds. Able to do what most law enforcement officers only dream of, Carlin is now able to look back in time at the perpetrator's movements, and at the life of the innocent woman whose death would set the events into motion. Carlin's instincts tell him that something is amiss, however, and while the government agent who tapped him for the job and the team of ultra-cool scientists who run the project tell him one story about the quantum physics behind this marvel of technology, the hotshot agent suspects that there is a greater power at their fingertips wherein one that might not just solve the crime at hand, but prevent it. This is a a gimmick picture, pure and simple. It tries hard to graft an emotional story of lost chances onto the gimmick, but ultimately the gimmick wins out as Tony Scott tries to combine action, science fiction, romance, and explosions into one movie, but the time travel conceit might be too preposterous and the action falls apart under scrutiny.But nevertheless,the ride of the first two-thirds is well worth the journey.So enjoy the ride while you can.",9,2,3,25 September 2012
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," E.T. Is Definitely A Film Classic
","Both a classic movie for kids and a remarkable portrait of childhood, E.T. is a sci-fi adventure that captures that strange moment in youth when the world is a place of mysterious possibilities, and the universe seems somehow separate from the one inhabited by grown-ups.It features Henry Thomas, Dee Wallace, Robert MacNaughton, Drew Barrymore, and Peter Coyote. It tells the story of Elliott, a lonely boy who befriends an extraterrestrial, dubbed 'E.T.', who is stranded on Earth.It is co- produced and directed by Steven Spielberg; and it was written by Melissa Mathison.Elliott, a young boy living with his single mother, his older brother Michael, and his younger sister Gertie. He often seems lonely and out of sorts, lost in his own world. One day, while looking for something in the back yard, he senses something mysterious in the woods watching him. And he's right: an alien spacecraft on a scientific mission mistakenly left behind an aging botanist who isn't sure how to get home. Eventually Elliott puts his fears aside and makes contact with the 'little squashy guy,' perhaps the least threatening alien invader ever to hit a movie screen. As Elliott tries to keep the alien under wraps and help him figure out a way to get home, he discovers that the creature can communicate with him telepathically. Soon they begin to learn from each other, and Elliott becomes braver and less threatened by life. E.T. rigs up a communication device from junk he finds around the house, but no one knows if he'll be rescued before a group of government scientists gets hold of him.Steven Spielberg's hit about a stranded alien and his loving relationship with a fatherless boy struck a chord with audiences everywhere, and it furthered his reputation as a director of equally strong commercial sensibilities and classical leanings. Henry Thomas gives a strong, emotional performance as E.T.'s young friend, Robert MacNaughton and Drew Barrymore make a solid impression as his siblings, and Dee Wallace is lively as the kids' mother.It is an appealing film this new one is, with some charm, some glee in the children's' triumphs, some share in their friendship with E.T.And playing as both an exciting sci-fi adventure and a remarkable portrait of childhood, this touching tale of a homesick alien remains a piece of movie magic for young and old.It remains a classic to this day after many decades of release.",10,2,4,2 October 2012
Casablanca," One Of The Most Beloved Film
","One of the most beloved American films, this captivating wartime adventure of romance and intrigue from director Michael Curtiz defies standard categorization. Simply put, it is the story of Rick Blaine, a world-weary ex-freedom fighter who runs a nightclub in Casablanca during the early part of World War II.Casablanca is a romantic drama film directed by Curtiz that features Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid, and featuring Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and Dooley Wilson. Set during Second World War, it focuses on a man torn between, in the words of one character, love and virtue. He must choose between his love for a woman and helping her and her Czech Resistance leader husband escape from the Vichy-controlled Moroccan city of Casablanca to continue his fight against the Nazis.Despite pressure from the local authorities, notably the crafty Capt. Renault, Rick's cafe has become a haven for refugees looking to purchase illicit letters of transit which will allow them to escape to America. One day, to Rick's great surprise, he is approached by the famed rebel Victor Laszlo and his wife, Ilsa, Rick's true love who deserted him when the Nazis invaded Paris. She still wants Victor to escape to America, but now that she's renewed her love for Rick, she wants to stay behind in Casablanca. 'You must do the thinking for both of us,' she says to Rick. He does, and his plan brings the story to its satisfyingly logical, if not entirely happy, conclusion. Despite a changing assortment of screenwriters frantically adapting an unstaged play and barely keeping ahead of production, and Bogart attempting his first romantic lead role, Casablanca won three Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Its characters, dialogue, and music have become iconic, and the film has grown in popularity to the point that it now consistently ranks near the top of lists of the greatest films of all time.An undisputed masterpiece and perhaps Hollywood's quintessential statement on love and romance, it has only improved with age, boasting career-defining performances from Bogart and Bergman. It has a peculiar magic to it, and it's in the richness of its details that mostly go unnoticed because of the film's pace.Despite of being released in 1942,the appeal of Casablanca shows no sign of diminishing as time goes by.",10,4,5,17 January 2012
Minority Report," An Excellent Cruise-Spielberg Collaboration
","Minority Report is an excellent science fiction film that is a collaboration of Hollywood superstar Tom Cruise and talented director Steven Spielberg.It was based The Minority Report,written by Philip K. Dick. It also stars Colin Farrell,Samantha Morton and Max von Sydow.It is a combination of a mystery,thriller and science fiction.It is 2054. Captain John Anderton,played by Tom Cruise, is the chief of the PreCrime police force,which uses future visions generated by three mutated humans with precognition abilities that predicts future events to prevent murders.The city has never had any murder for six years.He is addicted to an illegal psychoactive drug.It started following the disappearance of his son.His addiction caused his wife to leave him. With the PreCrime force poised to go nationwide, the system is audited by a member of the Department of Justice,Danny Witwer,played superbly by Colin Farrell. In the audit, the three mutated humans with precognition abilities,also known as precogs, predict that John Anderton will murder a man named Leo Crow in 36 hours. Believing the incident to be a setup, Anderton attempts to hide the case and quickly leaves the area.He seeks the advice of Dr. Iris Hineman,played by Lois Smith,the lead researcher of the PreCrime technology. She explains to him that the three precogs may see different visions of the future, and that the system only provides data on the two reports which agree. The minority report,which reflects the potential future where a predicted killer would have done something different, is discarded. According to her, the female precog Agatha,Samantha Morton in an excellent role, is likely the one who witnessed the minority report.The story is a combination action,mystery,suspense and thriller.It was excellent from beginning to end.Aside from that,the digital production design was simply outstanding. I consider one of the best films done by both Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg.Special mention should also be given to both Colin Farrell and Samantha Morton. It is a must-see for people that loves intelligent mystery thrillers.",10,1,2,8 October 2011
Finding Neverland," A Film About Peter Pan Creator J.M. Barrie
","Finding Neverland is a semi-biographical film about the story focuses on Scottish writer J. M. Barrie, his platonic relationship with Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, and his close friendship with her sons, who inspire the classic play Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up.It stars Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet together with Radha Mitchell,Julie Christie and Dustin Hoffman.The screenplay by David Magee is based on the play The Man Who Was Peter Pan by Allan Knee.It was directed by Marc Forster.Following the dismal reception of his latest play, Little Mary, Barrie meets the widowed Sylvia and her four young sons in Kensington Gardens, and a strong friendship develops between them. He proves to be a great playmate and surrogate father figure for the boys, and their imaginative antics give him ideas which he incorporates into a play about boys who do not want to grow up, especially one named after troubled young Peter Llewelyn Davies. His wife Mary, who eventually divorces him, and Sylvia's mother Emma du Maurier, object to the amount of time Barrie spends with the Llewelyn Davies family. Emma also seeks to control her daughter and grandsons, especially as Sylvia becomes increasingly weak from an unidentified illness.Producer Charles Frohman skeptically agrees to mount Peter Pan despite his belief it holds no appeal for upper-class theatergoers. Barrie peppers the opening night audience with children from a nearby orphanage, and the adults present react to their infectious delight with an appreciation of their own. The play proves to be a huge success.Because Sylvia is too ill to attend the production, Barrie arranges to have an abridged production of it performed in her home. She dies shortly afterward, and Barrie finds that her will is to have him and her mother to look after the boys; an arrangement agreeable to both.Finding Neverland is not exactly the way it happened, but this is a movie with a higher truth, one we need to believe in. And you will believe. You will.Like Big Fish and The Neverending Story, this is a film that reminds us that life, colored by our perceptions, is what we make it; all we have to do is believe.It won't pass muster for those looking for historical and Johnny Depp gives a graceful performance as Peter Pan creator J.M. Barrie.",10,2,2,11 October 2012
If I Stay," Music And Melodrama Dominates This Young Adult Romance Film
","If I Stay features movie star on the rise,Chloe Grace Moretz and gives her all in this young adult romantic film that tells the story of Mia,who is faced with the decision whether to live or to join her family,who all died in a car accident.In addition to that,there is a storyline involving her with regards to making a decision as to whether to pursue a musical career at Julliard or be with her love of her life,Adam portrayed by Jamie Blackley. This film directed by R.J. Cutler that has a supporting cast the includes Mireille Enos,Joshua Leonard,Aisha Hinds and veteran actor Stacy Keach is based on Gayle Foreman's novel of the same title is dominated by music and melodrama together with some elements of the supernatural wherein we see Mia in a spiritual existence as she sees the people who visits her while in coma fighting for her existence at the ICU.It was evident that the movie is directed at a particular audience namely young adults.Too bad that people not within that age group would find the movie lacking authenticity,emotionally manipulative and a tearjerker that modern movies at present move away from.Somehow even mature young adults belonging in that particular group would somehow find it clichéd and predictable as well and would lack appreciation for it.Aside from that,the love story involving Mia and Adam is far from believable as well considering that both barely have similar traits and characteristics.Even the type of music that they play are different from each other with one being classical music and the other being rock music.It just manages to put the familiar young adult romantic relationship that people of different characteristics can pull through a successful relationship.But overall,it just provides the viewer some confusion on their attraction to one another despite their lack of similarities character-wise.The performances in the film is satisfactory overall.But Chloe Grace Moretz was definitely far from satisfactory.It was outstanding as she was able to make the viewer empathize with her character as Mia with the many events of her life from falling in love with Adam;the pressure she felt during her audition at Julliard;the life-changing decisions she was about to make from either joining her parents and young brother who all failed to survive the car accident or joining her boyfriend by continuing her existence; and her maturity from being a young girl into a young adult the moment she entered into a relationship with Adam.Despite the emotional manipulation and melodramatic elements of the storyline involving her character, Moretz somehow minimized them through her performance as Mia including her indecision in either staying in existence or dying at deathbed to join her family who just passed away that somehow slowed the story down somehow and provided it some seemingly boring moments. In the end, one could see the potential she has and a great future that she possess as an actress in the years to come.In summary, Moretz's portrayal of Annie alone was able to lift this young adult romance film higher than just an average rating.",8,1,1,10 March 2015
G.I. Jane," Demi's Surprising Turn In A Movie Falters
","Ridley Scott directed this flawed but involving study of Lt. Jordan O'Neil, a Navy topographic analyst who is chosen as a test case for the presence of women in combat. G.I. Jane is an action film tells the fictional story of the first woman to undergo training in U.S. Navy Special Warfare Group.The movie stars Demi Moore together with Viggo Mortensen and Anne Bancroft.The SEAL/CRT (Combined Reconnaissance Team) course depicted in the film is offered at Coronado Naval Amphibious Base in California.O'Neil is hand-picked by U.S. Senator Lillian DeHaven to go through the rigorous training right along with the men. Also,she faces sexism and physical challenges as well as the horse-trading by the Senator who selected her for the experimental program.In the story,aware that she is making history and knowing that 60% of all male trainees will fail the rigorous training, Lt. O'Neil struggles to prove herself physically and mentally worthy of becoming a Navy SEAL. What she doesn't know is that she is being sold out by hard-bitten Texas senator Lillian DeHaven, who is being blackmailed by the Defense Department with politically fatal base closings unless O'Neil fails the program. The complicated political subplot, however, only distracts from the film's real virtues -- the wonderfully staged scenes of CRT selection training -- and fizzles at its climactic moment. The training scenes are wonderful, however, as the central recruits are pushed to their physical limits by a grueling weeding-out process.Master Chief John James Urgayle, a steely-eyed, tough-as-nails instructor who somehow finds time to quote D.H. Lawrence when he isn't making people eat garbage and beating O'Neil senseless as part of a training exercise. Mortensen and the believably-buffed Moore are terrific, and their scenes of confrontation are the film's high points. Unfortunately, the screenplay by David Twohy and Danielle Alexandra falls down every time it attempts to sidestep a cliché, and the climactic mission positively wallows in a predictable Top Gun muddle. Still, the characters are engaging and those looking for an enjoyable variant on the basic- training sub-genre of high-octane modern action films should be pleased.Demi Moore tries a surprising turn to play Lt. Jordan O'Neil,who unfortunately turns more into an action figure instead of a character that is a human being the possesses both strength and weaknesses. Added to that,the it was an unrealistic execution of an intriguing premise and does not make it a point to make it realistic and plausible.Also,Scott's direction turn into making the film commercially viable by presenting Demi's scenes by overselling them. Too bad that it could have been a good movie considering the talent of the cast involved if the filmmakers prioritized telling a good story rather than prioritizing Demi's appeal into an interesting role.",6,1,2,14 December 2011
Chinatown," It's Chinatown
","Chinatown is a neo-noir film, directed by Roman Polanski from a screenplay by Robert Towne and starring Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway and John Huston. The film features many elements of the film noir genre, particularly a multi-layered story that is part mystery and part psychological drama. It was released by Paramount Pictures. The story, set in Los Angeles in 1937, was inspired by the California Water Wars, the historical disputes over land and water rights that had raged in southern California during the 1910s and 1920s, in which William Mulholland acted on behalf of Los Angeles interests to secure water rights in the Owens Valley.'You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't,' warns water baron Noah Cross, when smooth cop-turned-private eye J.J. 'Jake' Gittes starts nosing around Cross's water diversion scheme. That proves to be the ominous lesson of Chinatown, Roman Polanski's critically lauded 1974 revision of 1940s film noir detective movies. In 1930s Los Angeles, 'matrimonial work' specialist Gittes is hired by Evelyn Mulwray to tail her husband, Water Department engineer Hollis Mulwray. Gittes photographs him in the company of a young blonde and figures the case is closed, only to discover that the real Mrs. Mulwray had nothing to do with hiring Gittes in the first place. When Hollis turns up dead, Gittes decides to investigate further, encountering a shady old-age home, corrupt bureaucrats, angry orange farmers, and a nostril-slicing thug along the way. By the time he confronts Cross, Evelyn's father and Mulwray's former business partner, Jake thinks he knows everything, but an even more sordid truth awaits him. When circumstances force Jake to return to his old beat in Chinatown, he realizes just how impotent he is against the wealthy, depraved Cross. 'Forget it, Jake,' his old partner tells him. 'It's Chinatown.' Chinatown's period sheen renders this dilemma at once contemporary and timeless, pointing to larger implications about the effects of corporate rapaciousness on individuals.Reworking the somber underpinnings of detective noir along more pessimistic lines, Polanski and screenwriter Robert Towne convey a '70s-inflected critique of capitalist and bureaucratic malevolence in a carefully detailed period piece hearkening back to the genre's roots in the 1930s and '40s. Gittes always has a smart comeback like Humphrey Bogart's Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe, but the corruption Gittes finds is too deep for one man to stop. As bruised and cynical as the decade that produced it, this noir classic benefits from Robert Towne's brilliant screenplay, director Roman Polanski's steady hand, and wonderful performances from Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway.",10,1,2,4 March 2012
Monty Python's Life of Brian," A Classic Religious Satire Comedy
","Life of Brian, is a British comedy film written, directed and largely performed by the Monty Python comedy team that includes Graham Chapman,John Cleese,Terry Gilliam,Eric Idle,Terry Jones and Michael Palin. It tells the story of Brian Cohen,played by Graham Chapman, a young Jewish man who is born on the same day as, and next door to, Jesus Christ, and is subsequently mistaken for the Messiah.The film contains themes of religious satire that were controversial at the time of its release.On a midnight clear 2,000 years ago, three wise men enter a manger where a babe is wrapped in swaddling clothes. It is an infant called Brian...and the three wise men are in the wrong manger. For the rest of his life, Brian finds himself regarded as something of a messiah and yet he's always in the shadow of this other guy from Galilee. Brian is witness to the Sermon of the Mount, but his seat is in such a bad location that he can't hear any of it. Ultimately, he is brought before Pontius Pilate and sentenced to crucifixion, which takes place at that crowded, nonexclusive execution site a few blocks shy of Calvary. Rather than utter the Last Six Words, Brian leads his fellow crucifixees in a spirited rendition of a British music-hall cheer-up song 'Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.'The movie looked back 2000 years for its comic content, but was a decade ahead in provoking Christian controversy during its time of release.The historical lampoon of religious fanaticism may not be quite as hilarious as The Holy Grail but it's even more ambitious as it is far ahead of its time for it is a religious satire that does not target specific religions or religious leaders like, say, Jesus of Nazareth. Instead, it pokes fun at the mindless and fanatical among their followers which is an attack on religious zealotry and hypocrisy,which are things that that fellow from Nazareth didn't particularly care for either.Overall,it is one of the more cutting edge films of the 1970's for this religious farce from the classic comedy troupe is as poignant as it is funny and satirical.",10,2,7,25 October 2012

","Director David Fincher's dark, stylish thriller,Se7en ranks as one of the decade's most influential box-office successes and one of the best films he has ever made in his career.This thriller, which also contains horror and neo-noir elements, directed by David Fincher and written by Andrew Kevin Walker,stars Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman together with Gwyneth Paltrow, R. Lee Ermey and Kevin Spacey.Set in a hellish vision of a New York-like city, where it is always raining and the air crackles with impending death, the film concerns Det. William Somerset, a homicide specialist just one week from a well- deserved retirement. Every minute of his 32 years on the job is evident in Somerset's worn, exhausted face, and his soul aches with the pain that can only come from having seen and felt far too much. But Somerset's retirement must wait for one last case, for which he is teamed with young hotshot David Mills, the fiery detective set to replace him at the end of the week. Mills has talked his reluctant wife, Tracy, into moving to the big city so that he can tackle important cases, but his first and Somerset's last are more than either man has bargained for.Then,David Mills and William Somerset are deeply involved in a case involving a series of sadistic murders. Each murder corresponds to one of the seven deadly sins of Christianity: gluttony, envy, lust, pride, sloth, greed and wrath. A diabolical serial killer is staging grisly murders, choosing victims representing the seven deadly sins. First, an obese man is forced to eat until his stomach ruptures to represent gluttony, then a wealthy defense lawyer is made to cut off a pound of his own flesh as penance for greed. Somerset initially refuses to take the case, realizing that there will be five more murders, ghastly sermons about lust, sloth, pride, wrath, and envy presented by a madman to a sinful world. Somerset is correct, and something within him cannot let the case go, forcing the weary detective to team with Mills and see the case to its almost unspeakably horrible conclusion. This is definitely a classic thriller that presents a brutal, relentlessly grimy shocker with taut performances, slick gore effects, and a haunting finale.David Fincher is at the top of his form with Seven, one of the darkest, creepiest, and most brilliant serial killer pictures in American film history.Although the story can be considered formulaic,Fincher contrives a stylish, intentionally ugly look that transcends the pulp narrative that would leave the viewer breathless and horrified.Although it is a violent film,the director handles the violence with sensitivity, announcing its obscenity in spoken analysis and briefly glimpsed post mortem shots, but never showing the violent acts themselves for which he should be credited for the superb direction of this film.As for the performances,both Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman give excellent portrayal of the cops trying to solve the murder and catching Kevin Spacey,whose portrayal of the diabolical is one for the books and clearly has shown his acting talent and capabilities.Definitely,Seven is the most disquieting,memorable and powerful thriller in years.Truly a masterpiece.",10,1,3,29 December 2011
The Big Lebowski," Enormously Entertaining
","The Big Lebowski is a comedy written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen. Jeff Bridges stars as Jeff Lebowski, an unemployed Los Angeles slacker and avid bowler, who is referred to as 'The Dude'. After a case of mistaken identity, The Dude is introduced to a millionaire also named Jeffrey Lebowski. When the millionaire Lebowski's trophy wife is later kidnapped, he commissions The Dude to deliver the ransom to secure her release. The plan goes awry when The Dude's friend Walter Sobchak schemes to keep the full ransom.John Goodman,Steve Buscemi, Philip Seymour Hoffman, David Huddleston, Julianne Moore, Tara Reid, and John Turturro co-star to play key supporting roles.It is loosely based on Raymond Chandler's novel, The Big Sleep.Typically stunning visuals and sharp dialogue from the Coen Brothers, brought to life with strong performances from Goodman and Bridges. After the tight plotting and quirky intensity of Fargo, this casually amusing follow-up from the prolifically inventive Coen brothers seems like a bit of a lark. The plot--which finds Lebowski involved in a kidnapping scheme after he's mistaken for a rich guy with the same name- -is almost beside the point. What counts here is a steady cascade of hilarious dialogue, great work from Coen regulars John Goodman and Steve Buscemi, and the kind of cinematic ingenuity that puts the Coens in a class all their own. The result is a lot of laughs and a feeling of awe toward the craftsmanship involved.It was enormously entertaining.",10,1,5,23 October 2012

Fury," Pitt Is Great In This War Film
","Brad Pitt stars in this war movie entitled Fury which tells the story of a group of American soldiers that were stationed at Nazi Germany during the final days of World War II. Logan Lerman,Shia LaBeouf,Michael Peña,Jon Bernthal,Jason Isaacs and Scott Eastwood joins Pitt in this film written and directed by David Ayers.The setting of the screenplay was April of 1945.The Allies are going to make their final push in the European Theater. Don 'Wardaddy' Collier and his crew of soldiers that includes gunner Boyd 'Bible' Swan; loader Grady 'Coon-Ass' Travis; and driver Trini 'Gordo' Garcia are sent on a deadly mission behind enemy lines.Joining them is Norman Ellison, a raw recruit trained as a typist, who find himself encased in the tank as an assistant driver.Facing overwhelming odds such as being outnumbered and outgunned,Wardaddy and his men make an effort to strike against the Nazis.We get to see a great performance from Brad Pitt.No question about that.His character with a mixture of a passion for killing Nazi soldiers and showing lots of humanity is fun and to watch.As for the story,there is definitely a lot of tension and violence especially with Wardaddy and his men pursuit of their mission facing a lot of odds.But it somehow fell short of becoming a great movie as there is nothing really new in the story and the facts presented in it are already known to many who have taken History in High School.It would have been better if we have learned something new about World War II from it.",9,2,4,6 November 2016

Afterward, Project Mayhem members bring a kidnapped Marla to him, believing him to be Tyler, and leave them alone. The explosives detonate, collapsing the buildings, and the narrator and Marla watch the scene, holding hands.The story of the film involves the audience for intelligence and provocation of thoughts about the story's themes on manhood.Also,the nature of this film is something that is far from traditional but it still makes it a great film and arguably one of the best films released in history. Aside from that,the performances of Pitt and Norton were simply outstanding.It truly deserves its place in the top 20 of IMDb.",10,1,5,14 October 2011
As Good as It Gets," One Of The Best Romcoms Ever Released On Screen
","James L. Brooks directed this $50 million-plus romantic comedy entitled,As Good As It Gets,that features Jack Nicholson as a misanthropic, obsessive-compulsive novelist; Helen Hunt as a single mother with an asthmatic son; and Greg Kinnear as a gay artist. The screenplay was written by Mark Andrus and by Brooks as well.Dysfunctional, acid-tongued romance novelist Melvin Udall suffers from an obsessive-compulsive disorder and takes pride in his ability to offend. At a nearby cafe, the only waitress willing to stand up to his sarcastic tirades is Carol Connelly, a single mother struggling to raise her chronically asthmatic son. In Melvin's West Village apartment building, talented contemporary artist Simon Nye lives across the hall from Melvin. Simon is the current darling of the New York art world, reason enough to draw Melvin's verbal fire, but Simon's gay lifestyle is further grist for the novelist's malicious mill. These three New Yorkers, none of whom appears to have a chance in hell at finding true happiness, discover their fates intertwined because of the fourth complicated character in the piece, Verdell, a tiny Brussels Griffon dog . Melvin seems to have no friends or family, and he lives alone, working on his 62nd book. When Simon goes into the hospital after a brutal mugging, Melvin has to take care of Verdell, and the dog actually warms Melvin's cold heart to the degree that he sets up unsolicited medical care for Carol's son. Eventually, Melvin is cornered into driving Simon and Carol to Baltimore, and during a hotel stopover, Melvin confesses to Carol, 'You make me want to be a better man.' The trip becomes an odyssey of self-realization for all three. It's a mark of how magically written, directed and acted,it is that the viewer will end up loving this film despite knowing how haphazard, scatter shot and almost indefinable its charm is.Both James L. Brooks and Jack Nicholson, doing what they do best, combine smart dialogue and flawless acting to squeeze fresh entertainment value out of the romantic-comedy genre.Added to that,it is both funny and sad, the comedy was in the vein of Brooks' Terms of Endearment, except it was more eccentric and nuttier and in moments genuinely touching due to strong chemistry between Nicholson and Helen Hunt.It succeeds at many moments even while pursuing its doomed grand design.Overall,it is one of the best romantic comedies ever released on screen.",10,2,2,15 October 2012
Citizen Kane," A Landmark Achievement In Film
","Citizen Kane is a 1941 film, directed by and starring Orson Welles. It was released by RKO Pictures, and was Welles's first feature film. The film was nominated for Academy Awards in nine categories; it won an Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay) by Herman Mankiewicz and Welles. Citizen Kane has been voted the greatest film of all time in each of the last five Sight & Sound's polls of critics,and is particularly praised for its innovative cinematography, music and narrative structure.Orson Welles first feature film -- which he directed, produced, and co- wrote, as well as playing the title role -- proved to be his most important and influential work, a ground-breaking drama loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst which is frequently cited as the finest American film ever made.Aging newspaper magnate Charles Foster Kane dies in his sprawling Florida estate after uttering a single, enigmatic final word -- 'Rosebud' -- and newsreel producer Rawlston sends reporter Jerry Thompson out with the assignment of uncovering the meaning behind the great man's dying thought. As Thompson interviews Kane's friends, family, and associates, we learn the facts of Kane's eventful and ultimately tragic life: his abandonment by his parents after he becomes the heir to a silver mine; his angry conflicts with his guardian, master financier Walter Parks Thatcher ; his impulsive decision that 'it would be fun to run a newspaper' with the help of school chum Jedediah Leland and loyal assistant Mr. Bernstein; his rise from scandal sheet publisher to the owner of America's largest and most influential newspaper chain; his marriage to socially prominent Emily Norton, whose uncle is the President of the United States; Kane's ambitious bid for public office, which is dashed along with his marriage when his opponent, corrupt political boss Jim Gettys, reveals that Kane is having an affair with aspiring vocalist Susan Alexander; Kane's vain attempts to promote second wife Alexander as an opera star; and his final, self-imposed exile to a massive and never-completed pleasure palace called Xanadu. Welles's epic tale of a publishing tycoon's rise and fall is entertaining, poignant, and inventive in its storytelling, earning its reputation as a landmark achievement in film.",10,1,4,25 February 2012
Monster," Charlize Theron Excels In Monster
","Model-turned-actress Charlize Theron leaves her glamorous image behind for this gritty drama,Monster wherein which she plays a disturbed prostitute who becomes a serial killer.This crime drama is about serial killer Aileen Wuornos, a former prostitute who was executed in Florida in 2002 for killing six men in the late 1980s and early 1990's. She was played by Theron, and her fictionalized lover, Selby Wall which was based on Wuornos' real-life companion Tyria Moore, was played by Christina Ricci.Bruce Dern,Lee Tergesen and Annie Corley co-star to play key supporting roles. The film was written and directed by Patty Jenkins and it was inspired by the true story of Wuornos, whose life and death was chronicled in two documentaries by filmmaker Nick Broomfield, Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial Killer, and Aileen: The Life and Death of a Serial Killer.Aileen Wuornos was a woman who survived a brutal and abusive childhood in Michigan to become a thick-skinned but emotionally damaged adult. Homeless most of her life, Wuornos subsisted by working as a street prostitute; later, when she was in Florida, down to her last five dollars and pondering suicide, she stopped into a bar for a beer. There, Aileen met Selby Wall, a woman in her early twenties who had been sent to live with relatives after her Christian parents became aware of her lesbian lifestyle. Selby is immediately attracted to Aileen, and while Aileen tells Selby she's never been in a lesbian relationship, she soon finds herself equally infatuated with her. Selby runs away from her family and moves into a cheap hotel with Aileen, who initially pays the bills by hooking. However, as their money runs low and Aileen finds herself unable to land a regular job, tensions mount between the two. One night, after a john attacks her, Aileen pulls a gun and kills the man. Although her first murder can be categorized as self-defense, Aileen's loathing for the men who pay her for sex becomes so extreme that she begins killing her customers regardless of their behavior. Meanwhile, Selby slowly becomes aware of the full extent of her lover's instability and the bloody consequences of her actions.Charlize Theron gives a searing, deglamorized performance as real life serial killer Aileen Wuornos, an intense, disquieting portrait of a profoundly damaged soul.This remarkable movie finds compassion for Wuornos but unflinchingly faces her brutal crimes; Theron expresses this woman's horrific life history without softening her terrifying, dead- eyed stare. This is a gripping, devastating performance, a physical and psychological transformation comparable to Robert DeNiro's in Raging Bull. The movie's moral and emotional complexity wouldn't succeed without this great performance but succeed it does, and it will stick with you for some time afterward.That is why it deserves the highest rating based on that reasons stated.",10,1,2,27 October 2012

It is apparent that the film has a target audience - young adults - about not giving up on their dreams and about reaching the impossible goals that seems to be far fetched.Despite the fact that there is evidence of sign-posted plots and that the events that follow seem to be predictable to the viewer,it manages to become compelling and interesting due to Dennis Quaid's honest portrayal of Jim Morris.His performance allows us to see through the man who has a not-so-good relationship with his father and someone who felt unfulfilled in his favorite sport after he failed to play in the Majors due to many arm injuries that he has suffered.In addition to that,we also get to see someone who is concerned with his students and his perpetually losing baseball team to achieve greater heights.Finally,we get to see him as a caring father to his kids and a loving husband.These qualities made the viewer cheer for him all throughout the movie.What's also great about this sports family drama is it features two inspiring stories: Big Lake's winning the district championship and Morris' success on becoming the oldest rookie in the Majors.These stories teach the viewer never to give up; and that working hard and having heart in pursuing one's dream provides a better chance into coming into fruition.These lessons will definitely provide inspiration to the viewer in whatever goals and ambition that he has in mind.In summary,The Rookie is definitely one of the best sports film for the young audience out there.",10,1,1,20 March 2015
Memento," Memento Is A One Of A Kind Movie Experience
","Christopher Nolan is one of the most creative directors in Hollywood.His movie,Memento proves it.It is a great movie that is presented in non- traditional way that would make the viewer appreciate it even more as compared to other great films.Memento is a psychological thriller film written and directed by Nolan,who adapted from his younger brother Jonathan's short story entitled,Memento Mori. It stars Guy Pearce as Leonard Shelby, a man with anterograde amnesia,which impairs his ability to store new explicit memories. During the opening credits, which portray the end of the story, it is shown that Leonard kills Teddy,played by Joe Pantoliano. The film suggests that this killing is vengeance for the rape and murder of his wife based on information provided by Natalie,played by Carrie- Anne Moss.This film is often used to show the distinction between plot and story. Its events unfold in two separate, alternating narratives — one in color, and the other in black-and-white. The black-and-white sections are told in chronological order, showing Leonard conversing with an anonymous phone caller in a motel room. Leonard's investigation is depicted in color sequences that are in reverse chronological order. As each sequence begins, the audience is unaware of the preceding events, just like Leonard, thereby giving the viewer a sense of his confusion. By the film's end when the two narratives converge we understand the investigation and the events that lead up to Teddy's death.Memento is not only a film that would give the audience great entertainment but it is also provides them a one of a kind movie experience.Aside from having the plot and the story told in a non- traditional manner whether it is colored/black and white or chronological/reverse-chronological,it involves the viewer into solving the puzzles and mysteries of a crime thriller. Although some may not appreciate the way the story was told as people may not get right way the fashion on how the plot and the story is being told,it nevertheless puts the viewer into the inner workings of the mind as well as the character of Leonard as well as emotions depicted in the movie.That is why it definitely provides the viewer an absorbing experience although it may create confusion to some.",10,1,2,18 October 2011
Inglourious Basterds," A Fictional Film That Could Replace Actual History
","A group of hardened Nazi killers stalk their prey in Nazi-occupied France as a Jewish cinema owner plots to take down top-ranking SS officers during the official premiere of a high-profile German propaganda film entitled,Inglourious Basterds.It is a war film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino and it features Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz and Mélanie Laurent. It tells the fictional story of two plots to assassinate the Nazi Germany political leadership, one planned by a young French Jewish cinema proprietor, and the other by a team of Jewish Allied soldiers led by First Lieutenant Aldo Raine.As far as Lt. Aldo Raine is concerned, the only good Nazi is a dead Nazi. Raine's mission is to strike fear into the heart of Adolf Hitler by brutally murdering as many goose-steppers as possible, or die trying. In order to accomplish that goal, Lt. Raine recruits a ruthless team of cold-blooded killers known as 'The Basterds' which includes baseball- bat-wielding Bostonian Sgt. Donnie Donowitz and steely psychopath Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz, among others. When the Basterds' secret rendezvous with turncoat German actress Bridget von Hammersmark goes awry, they learn that the Nazis will be staging the French premiere of 'The Nation's Pride,' a rousing propaganda film based on the exploits of German hero Fredrick Zoller, at a modest theater owned by Jewish cinephile Shoshanna Dreyfus, posing as a Gentile after the brutal murder of her family by the ruthless Col. Hans Landa. As the Basterds hatch an explosive plan to take out as many Nazis as possible at the premiere, they remain completely oblivious to the fact that Shoshanna, too, longs to bring the Third Reich to its knees, and that she's willing to sacrifice her beloved theater in the process.This is a classic Tarantino genre-blending thrill ride of a great movie.It is violent, unrestrained, and thoroughly entertaining.This was a World War II revamped Tarantino style movie that succeeds as the ultimate fantasy revenge story as a Kill Hitler which stands as one the best works in the career of its influential filmmaker.It shows how they Shows how most of us turn to film for both fantasy escape and an avenue to make the abstract past tangible, enough to even possibly, and powerfully, replace actual history.Attribute that to the cast brilliant and excellent performance and Tarantino's direction. The only negative thing about it is the film was overlong and draggy in some scenes. But despite some of the scenes dragging on too long, Inglourious Basterds is still a lot of fun, altering history for the better as the Nazis feel the force of redemption.",10,4,10,5 January 2012
Amistad," All About African Slavery
","Amistad is a historical film directed by Steven Spielberg.The movie stars a talented cast that includes Morgan Freeman,Anthony Hopkins,Djimon Hounsou,Matthew McConaughey,Nigel Hawthorne,Stellan Skarsgård,Harry Blackmun and Anna Paquin.It was based on the true story of an uprising in 1839 by newly captured African slaves that took place aboard the ship La Amistad off the coast of Cuba, the subsequent voyage to the Northeastern United States, and the legal battle that followed their capture by a United States revenue cutter. It shows how, even though the case was won at the federal district court level, it was appealed by President Martin Van Buren to the Supreme Court, and how former President John Quincy Adams took part in the proceedings.The movie opens showing Cinque and the other Africans in a violent takeover of the Amistad. Captured, they are imprisoned in New England where former slave Theodore Joadson, viewing the rebels as 'freedom fighters,' approaches property lawyer Baldwin, who attempts to prove the Africans were 'stolen goods' because they were kidnapped. Running for re-election, President Martin Van Buren overturns the lower court's decision in favor of the Africans. Former President John Quincy Adams is reluctant to become involved, but when the case moves on to the Supreme Court, Adams stirs emotions with a powerful defense. The story line occasionally cuts away to Spain where the young Queen Isabella plays with dolls; she later debated the Amistad case with seven U.S. presidents.Amistad is worth seeing just for people to know about this important story, this moment in history.This is the most straightforward, understated, and powerful big-screen representation of the slavery in recent movie history. And for that, it should be recommended to everyone.",9,1,5,18 September 2012
Shakespeare in Love," A Masterpiece Romantic Comedy
","Shakespeare in Love is a romantic comedy drama that depicts a love affair involving playwright William Shakespeare at the time that he was writing the play Romeo and Juliet.It features Joseph Fiennes as Shakespeare together with Gwyneth Paltrow,Geoffrey Rush,Colin Firth,Ben Affleck and Judi Dench. The story is fiction, though several of the characters are based on real people. In addition, many of the characters, lines, and plot devices are references to Shakespeare's plays.It is written by Marc Norman and playwright Tom Stoppard; and it directed by John MaddenWilliam Shakespeare is on a cold streak. Not only is he writing for Philip Henslow, owner of 'The Rose,' a theater whose doors are about to be closed by sadistic creditors, but he's got a nasty case of writer's block. Shakespeare hasn't written a hit in years. In fact, he hasn't written much of anything recently. Thus, the Bard finds himself in quite a bind when Henslowe, desperate to stave off another round of hot-coals- to-feet application, stakes The Rose's solvency on Shakespeare's new comedy, 'Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter.' The problem is, 'Romeo' is safely 'locked away' in Shakespeare's head, which is to say that not a word of it is written. Meanwhile, the lovely Lady Viola is an ardent theater-goer which is scandalous for a woman of her breeding that especially admires Shakespeare's plays and, not incidentally, Bill himself. Alas, she's about to be sold as property into a loveless marriage by her mercenary father and shipped off to a Virginia tobacco plantation. But not before dressing up as a young man and winning the part of Romeo in the embryonic play. Shakespeare soon discovers the deception and goes along with it, using the blossoming love affair to ignite his muse. As William and Viola's romance grows in intensity and spirals towards its inevitable culmination, so, too, does the farcical comedy about Romeo and pirates transform into the timeless tragedy that is Romeo and Juliet.One of the most winning and intelligent romantic comedies of the 1990's, Shakespeare in Love is filled with such good will, sunny romance, snappy one-liners, and devilish cleverness that it's absolutely irresistible.Like Shakespeare's work itself, the film is instantly accessible to everyone, from the raucous groundings looking for low comedy to the aesthetes hankering for some intellectual bite behind their entertainment. It is exquisitely acted, tightly directed and impressively assembled, this lively period piece is the kind of arty gem with potentially broad appeal to everyone who would watch this movie. Added to that,it is endlessly witty, visually rapturous, and sweetly romantic,it is a delightful romantic comedy that succeeds on nearly every level as it moves fast and may deserve multiple viewings.A masterpiece indeed.",10,1,1,15 October 2012
World War Z," Brad Pitt Battles The Zombies
","World War Z is an apocalyptic was based on the novel of the same title by Max Brooks. It stars Brad Pitt as Gerry Lane,a former United Nations investigator that must travel the world to find a way to stop a zombie- like pandemic. Marc Forster directs.Happily living in Philadelphia and taking on the role of house husband with his wife and two daughters, Lane's domestic tranquility is shattered in the center of a traffic jam that turns into a run-for-your- life showdown with some zippy zombies whose bite turns you into a killing machine in a few seconds. Lane and his family are rescued by the UN forces dispatched to bring them to a mobile military base on an aircraft carrier. Gerry doesn't want to leave his family but it is made clear that if he doesn't join the global search for a cure, his family will be kicked off the ship. The search takes Gerry and a brilliant scientist to South Korea in search of patient zero. Using his knack for observation, Gerry is forming a plan to fight back and hopes to continue the search in Wales at a World Health Organization lab. However, the plane has a zombie stowaway. The movie's ultimate strength is its ability to consistently create tension-filled situations for its characters after laying out very specific parameters.Although it has an investigative aspect to it,World War Z gets most of its mileage out of danger that is experienced by the characters. Despite the fact that it has a couple of loose ends from a story standpoint, the film's visual spectacle makes up for its implausibility.Overall,World War Z a very tense and action-filled film that wrings maximum tension out of its life-or-death situations using the future of humanity at stake as a plot.",9,2,8,13 August 2013

","Based on the book written by Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer that chronicles his experiences in Tibet between 1944 and 1951 during the Second World War;the interim period;and the Chinese People's Liberation Army's invasion of Tibet in 1950,Seven Years In Tibet tells the story of a man who undergoes character change that was prompted with one's relationship to the Dalai Lama.Brad Pitt stars as the arrogant Heinrich Harrer,a famed Austrian mountain climber who leaves behind his wife and infant son to head a Himalayan expedition in 1939, only to fall into the hands of Allied forces as a prisoner of war. He and a fellow escapee, Peter Aufschnaiter,played by David Thewlis, make their way to the Forbidden City in Tibet, where Peter finds a wife and Heinrich befriends the Western culture-obsessed teenage Dalai Lama,portrayed by Jamyang Jamtsho Wangchuk, the spiritual leader of his Buddhist nation. As Heinrich waits out the war, his friendship with the Dalai Lama begins to transform him from haughty to humble, but a crisis with China looms.The film ends with a series of title cards that list figures that quantify the death and destruction as a result of Chinese occupation. Harrer kept a good relationship with Dalai Lama after his flee from Tibet to India.The story was characterized as a road picture,epic and spiritual journey of Harrer.It is a beautiful film with a story so typical-yet-unusual coming-of-age of a man who becomes a better person.Although the relationship between Harrer and Dalai Lama was lacking,it manages to become interesting due to the extra-ordinary performance of Brad Pitt.Because of it,the film does not fall short in both satisfaction and entertainment despite this shortcoming.",9,1,1,29 December 2011

Returning to the year 1990, six years before the start of the plague, Cole is soon imprisoned in a psychiatric facility because his warnings sound like mad ravings. There he meets a scientist named Dr. Kathryn Railly and Jeffrey Goines, the mad son of an eminent virologist. Cole is returned by the authorities to the year 2035, and finally ends up at his intended destination in 1996. He kidnaps Dr. Railly in order to enlist her help in his quest. Cole discovers graffiti by an apparent animal rights group called the Army of the Twelve Monkeys, but as he delves into the mystery, he hears voices, loses his bearings, and doubts his own sanity. He must figure out if Goines, who seems to be a raving lunatic, holds the key to the puzzle.Dark and somber, this sci-fi is a spectacular mess, a convoluted film with too many ideas for its own good like blending the virus thriller with the post-apocalyptic genre.The film is definitely mystifying, intriguing, even infuriating,as it shows what happens when an unconventional talent meets straightforward material.Aside from that,it is also rich in visual detail and it offers an involving and occasionally baffling storyline that builds the tension to positively unbearable levels until the final reel.As for the performances of the cast,Bruce Willis gives an eruptive performance of startling emotional intensity as Cole.This is a must-see for people who loves sci-fiction for it is both satisfying and entertaining due to the excellent performances and mind-blowing plot twists.",10,1,1,29 December 2011
42," 42 Is An Inspirational Film
","42 is a biographical sports film about the life of baseball player Jackie Robinson, who wore jersey number 42. The film stars Chadwick Boseman as Robinson together with Harrison Ford,Christopher Meloni,John C. McGinley, T. R. Knight,Lucas Black and Nicole Beharie.It was written and directed by Brian Helgeland.It tells the story of two men - the great Jackie Robinson and legendary Brooklyn Dodgers GM Branch Rickey,whose brave stand against prejudice forever changed the world by changing the game of baseball. In 1946, Branch Rickey put himself at the forefront of history when he signed Jackie Robinson,who became the first African-American player to break the baseball color barrier to the team and also breaking Major League Baseball's infamous color line. But the deal also put both Robinson and Rickey in the firing line of the public, the press and even other players. Facing unabashed racism from every side, Robinson was forced to demonstrate tremendous courage and restraint by not reacting in kind, knowing that any incident could destroy his and Rickey's hopes. Instead, Robinson let his talent on the field do the talking-ultimately winning over fans and his teammates, silencing his critics, and paving the way for others to follow.This story inspires and entertains with a vital chapter in this nation's history.It is a compelling, uplifting story about two men who deserve to be remembered.In addition to that,it is a compelling, uplifting story about two men who deserve to be remembered. This isn't a film filled with lights-shattering home runs like The Natural and the awkward dramatic devices are kept to a minimum.There's plenty of period action for the baseball fan, from a recreation of Ebbets Field to John C. McGinley's sterling Red Barber impersonation. Jackie is seen on the diamond, tormenting pitchers by dangling off the bases, forever threatening to steal the next bag.Also,it is really about the sport. This is a movie about a man who put on his uniform each day, stepped up to the plate and did his job at significant physical risk, in the face of hateful taunts, vicious threats and profound isolation. It's the stuff that history is made of.Definitely,an inspirational film that everyone should see.",10,9,12,16 April 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Full Of Humor And Top-Notch Action
","Captain Jack Sparrow returns to the screen for another round of supernatural adventures on the high seas in this spirited sequel to the 2003 Disney hit, which re-teams original director Gore Verbinski with original screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is an adventure fantasy comedy film that stars Johnny Depp,Orlando Bloom,Keira Knightley,Stellan Skarsgård together with Bill Nighy,Jack Davenport,Kevin R. McNally and Jonathan Pryce.It is the second of the Pirates of the Caribbean series following Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. In the film, the marriage of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann is interrupted by Lord Cutler Beckett, who wants Turner to acquire Sparrow's compass, and Captain Jack Sparrow discovers his debt to Davy Jones is due.As Will and Elizabeth prepare to exchange vows at the altar, their wedding plans hit rough waters with the arrival of sea-bound scallywag Jack Sparrow. It seems that Sparrow owes a substantial blood debt to half-octopus sea captain Davy Jones, and that the only way for the flamboyant sea rover to elude the wrath of his otherworldly pursuer is to seek the aid of mysterious and powerful voodoo priestess Tia Dalma, whose ability to resurrect the dead and gaze into the future may provide just the advantage needed to avoid a waterlogged fate in the locker of his legendary nemesis.The second Pirates of the Caribbean movie is a sweet umbrella drink leaving no hangover, two hours and 20 minutes of escapism that once again makes the movies safe for guilt-free fun.Despite the fact that it's not as strong as the first installment,it still is entertaining as it still full of humor and top-notch action.",9,1,2,21 October 2012
Rocky V," Good Thing There Was Rocky Balboa
","It was touted upon its release to be the final installment of the Rocky movie franchise.It reunites star Sylvester Stallone with John G. Avildsen, director of the Oscar-winning Rocky. Rocky V is the fifth film in the series.It stars Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire,Burt Young,Burgess Meredith,Tony Burton, Stallone's real life son Sage Stallone, and real life boxer Tommy Morrison as boxer Tommy Gunn, a talented yet raw boxer.The movie explores the relationship between Rocky and his son,Rocky Jr. The story has Rocky Balboa, suffering from career-ending brain damage as a result of his punishing bout with Ivan Drago at the finale of the Rocky IV,the previous film. Upon their return to Philadelphia, Rocky and his wife, Adrian,discover they are broke, their fortune squandered by an incompetent accountant. Forced to move back to their working-class neighborhood, Rocky finds that his only asset is the run-down gym willed to him by Mickey. Resisting big money offered to him by Don King-like boxing promoter George Washington Duke, Rocky becomes a trainer and finds a talented comer in Tommy Gunn. Rocky's son feels neglected by his father, who lavishes attention on his protégé, but Tommy ultimately turns his back on his mentor to sign a more lucrative deal with Duke, leading to a street-fight showdown - which was a bad way to end the franchise.A lot of Rocky fans just hated this film.Even Sylvester Stallone rated it a zero.The star practically disowns this film.Well,the film just lost the underdog theme.The fact that the Balboas return to their old Philadelphia neighborhood is the only thing new in this film.Although it tries to recapture the original Rocky spirit with this,it failed in its purpose miserably.One reason I have said is that the underdog theme which has kept the franchise afloat and is definitely missing in it.The Rocky-Tommy Gunn relationship fails as well considering that fans would rather see Rocky fighting inside the ring as an underdog rather than the development of the protégé just as he is portraying the role of Mick,his trainer.Finally,the last street-fight boxing match just looked out of place.The performances were okay in this film.Nothing worth mentioning and nothing worth criticizing either.The film just looked completely lost from the series.The flashbacks and the return to Balboa's roots were the only ones linking it to the Rocky franchise.Nothing more.Overall,just like Rocky die-hards,I think that this is the worst installment of the series behind Rocky,Rocky Balboa,Rocky II,Rocky III and Rocky IV.Good thing that Rocky Balboa or Rocky VI was made to make up for Rocky V - which I believe is the great conclusion and proper way to end the series.",6,1,1,23 October 2011
Argo," Argo Makes Ben Affleck This Generation's Best Director
","Argo is a thriller film that chronicles the life-or-death covert operation to rescue six Americans, which unfolded behind the scenes of the Iran hostage crisis-the truth of which was unknown by the public for decades. As the Iranian revolution reaches its boiling point, militants storm the U.S. embassy in Tehran, taking 52 Americans hostage. But, in the midst of the chaos, six Americans manage to slip away and find refuge in the home of the Canadian ambassador. Knowing it is only a matter of time before the six are found out and likely killed, a CIA 'exfiltration' specialist named Tony Mendez, portrayed by Ben Affleck, comes up with a risky plan to get them safely out of the country. The film stars also Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin, and John Goodman in supporting roles.Militants storm the United States embassy in Tehran on November 4, 1979, in retaliation for CIA involvements in Iran. More than 50 of the embassy staff are taken as hostages, but six escape and hide in the home of the Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor. With the escapees' situation kept secret, the US State Department begins to explore options for ex-filtrating them from Iran.Mendez was brought in for consultation, criticizes the proposals, but is at a loss for an alternative. While on the phone with his son, he is inspired by watching Battle for the Planet of the Apes and begins plans for creating a cover story for the escapees being Canadian filmmakers scouting for exotic locations in Iran for a similar science-fiction film.Mendez and his supervisor Jack O'Donnell contact John Chambers, a Hollywood make-up artist who has previously crafted disguises for the CIA. Chambers puts them in touch with film producer Lester Siegel. Together they set up a phony film studio, publicize their plans, and successfully establish the pretense of developing Argo, a 'science fantasy' in the style of Star Wars, to lend credibility to the cover story. Posing as a producer for Argo, Mendez enters Iran and links up with the six escapees. He provides them with Canadian passports and fake identities to prepare them to get through security at the airport. Although afraid to trust Mendez's scheme, they reluctantly go along with it, knowing that he is risking his own life too. A scouting visit to the bazaar to maintain their cover story takes a bad turn, but their Iranian culture contact gets them away from the hostile crowd.Mendez is told that the operation has been canceled to avoid conflicting with a planned military rescue of the hostages. He pushes ahead, forcing O'Donnell to hastily re-obtain authorization for the mission to get tickets on a Swissair flight. Tension rises at the airport, where the escapees' flight reservations are confirmed at the last minute, and a guard's call to the supposed studio in Hollywood is answered at the last second. The group boards the plane just as the Revolutionary Guards at the airport uncover the ruse and try to stop their plane from getting off the runway, but they are too late, as Mendez and the six successfully leave Iran.Argo has that solid, kick-the-tires feel of those studio films from the 70s that were about something but also entertained. Only it's as laugh outright amusing, as it is sobering. The top-notch packaging reveals for what it really is: less a nail-biting chamber-piece character drama and more a coolly realized, wildly reckless, action film. As for Ben Affleck effort as a director, it is easily the most cohesive and technically accomplished of his three films so far after The Town and Gone Baby Gone. His Oscar snub undeserved for this truly presents him as generation's best director. As for the acting, Goodwin and Arkin are simply amazing that makes the story wildly entertaining thriller that proves of the old Hollywood adage that fiction is stranger than truth after all. As for Affleck, he gives an average portrayal of Mendez - a kind of anti-Bourne, comfortable with his anonymity, living off his wits, not his fists. It is definitely one of the best movies of the year – a close second to Zero Dark Thirty.",10,1,5,26 March 2013

12 Angry Men," A Legal Cinema Masterpiece
","A Puerto Rican youth is on trial for murder, accused of knifing his father to death.Directed by Sidney Lumet, 12 Angry Men tells the story of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt. In the United States, the verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous one way or the other. The film is notable for its almost exclusive use of one set: with the exception of the film's opening, which begins outside on the steps of the courthouse and ends with the jury's final instructions before retiring, a brief final scene on the courthouse steps and two short scenes in an adjoining washroom, the entire movie takes place in the jury room. The twelve jurors retire to the jury room, having been admonished that the defendant is innocent until proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Eleven of the jurors vote for conviction, each for reasons of his own. The sole holdout is Juror #8, played by Henry Fonda. As Fonda persuades the weary jurors to re-examine the evidence, we learn the backstory of each man. Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb), a bullying self-made man, has estranged himself from his own son. Juror #7 (Jack Warden) has an ingrained mistrust of foreigners; so, to a lesser extent, does Juror #6 (Edward Binns). Jurors #10 (Ed Begley) and #11 (George Voskovec), so certain of the infallibility of the Law, assume that if the boy was arrested, he must be guilty. Juror #4 (E.G. Marshall) is an advocate of dispassionate deductive reasoning. Juror #5 (Jack Klugman), like the defendant a product of 'the streets,' hopes that his guilty vote will distance himself from his past. Juror #12 (Robert Webber), an advertising man, doesn't understand anything that he can't package and market. And Jurors #1 (Martin Balsam), #2 (John Fiedler) and #9 (Joseph Sweeney), anxious not to make waves, 'go with the flow.' The excruciatingly hot day drags into an even hotter night; still, Fonda character,Juror #8 chips away at the guilty verdict, insisting that his fellow jurors bear in mind those words 'reasonable doubt.'This is a classic film wherein where tension comes from personality conflict, dialogue and body language.Although it may sound ungallant, these 12 Angry Men, are all right without distaff glamour. Their dramas are powerful and provocative enough to keep a viewer spellbound.Sidney Lumet,who is in his directorial debut,effectively modulates the drama without ever taking the camera out of the jury room until the verdict is in and the jury is out.As for the story,it was mechanically written, but within its own middlebrow limitations, it delivers the goods as it presents a powerful impact to the viewer.",10,1,1,9 January 2012
Beauty and the Beast," Probably The Best Disney Movie
","Beauty And The Beast is one of my personal favorite Disney animated films.Its timeless theme about love and kindness appeals not only to children but to adults likewise.The story centers around a prince who is transformed into a Beast and a young woman named Belle whom he imprisons in his castle. Belle is a girl who is dissatisfied with life in a small provincial French town, constantly trying to fend off the misplaced 'affections' of conceited Gaston. A wrong turn taken by Maurice, Belle's father, causes the two to meet.To become a prince again, the Beast must love Belle and win her love in return, or he will remain a Beast forever. A wrong turn taken by Maurice, Belle's father, causes the two to meet.Narrated by Mia Farrow, who also supplies all the character voices, this half-hour animated version of Beauty and the Beast was originally a component of 'Stories to Remember', an internationally syndicated package of children's story adaptations.Aside from that,it features great music such as the 'Beauty and the Beast' theme performed by Céline Dion and Peabo Bryson,'Be Our Guest','Beauty and The Beast (tale as old as time)','Belle' and 'Something There'.Overall,this isn't merely the best of the fairy tale features but it's very close to being the best Disney movie of them all.",10,4,6,26 October 2011
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," A Romcom That Is A Class Of Its Own
","Crazy, Stupid, Love is a romantic comedy with a big heart.That is it is a refreshing change and almost a throwback to a golden era of romance. It relies on the sharp writing by Dan Fogelman and the sparkly chemistry of its cast, led by Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Julianne Moore, and the emerging superstar Emma Stone. John Carroll Lynch,Analeigh Tipton,Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon play key supporting roles.It's not that the plot is ground-breaking but it is maybe the fact, the appeal of it is that it's all too easy to relate to the characters and the story.At forty-something,straight-laced Cal Weaver is living a perfect life with the dream-good job, nice house, great kids and marriage to his high school sweetheart. But when Cal learns that his wife, Emily has cheated on him and wants a divorce, his life quickly unravels. Worse, in today's single world, Cal, who hasn't dated in decades, stands out as the epitome of being uncomfortable as a single person. Now spending his free evenings sulking alone at a local bar, the hapless Cal is taken on as wing man and protégée to handsome, thirty-something player Jacob Palmer.This is not the ultimate romantic comedy.It is one that makes you fall as hard for the characters as they do for one another while savoring their every interaction.Also,it seems fresher and less recycled than much of the movies released out there.It gets better and funnier after a labored and lumbering start, which is entirely the opposite of most Hollywood comedies.It's the interplay between the characters, the true humanity of their emotions that is long missing from many contemporary romcoms that set this film in a class of its own.",10,3,6,15 October 2012
The Notebook," Good Enough To Rise Above Melodrama
","The Notebook is a romantic drama film directed by Nick Cassavetes, based on the romance novel of the same title by Nicholas Sparks. It stars Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams as a young couple who fall in love during the early 1940's. Their story is narrated from the present day by an elderly man played by James Garner, telling the tale to a fellow nursing home resident, played by Gena Rowlands.The film's story revolves around Noah Calhoun's regular visits to a female patron of an area nursing home. Rather than bore her with the inanities of everyday life, Calhoun reads from an old, faded notebook containing the sweeping account of a young couple whose love affair was tragically put to a halt after their separation in the midst of World War II. Seven years later, the couple was reunited, and, despite having taken radically different paths, they found themselves unable to resist the call of a second chance.Bland and sentimental, the movie is old-fashioned filmmaking aimed at an old-fashioned viewers.But nevertheless,It's hard not to admire its unabashed sentimentality.It is definitely too clumsily manipulative put tears into the viewer and good enough to rise above its melodramatic clichés.",10,1,2,28 September 2012
Public Enemies," A Must-See John Dillinger Movie
","Based on author Bryan Burrough's ambitious tome Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933-43, director Michael Mann's sprawling historical crime drama,Public Enemies follows the efforts of top FBI agent Melvin Purvis in capturing notorious bank robber John Dillinger.It stars Johnny Depp and Christian Bale together Marion Cotillard, Billy Crudup, Stephen Dorff, Stephen Lang, Jason Clarke, Stephen Graham, Rory Cochrane, Branka Katic, Channing Tatum, Giovanni Ribisi and Shawn Hatosy. Set during the Great Depression, the film chronicles the final years of the notorious bank robber John Dillinger as he is pursued by Federal Bureau of Investigation agent Melvin Purvis, and his relationship with Billie Frechette, as well as Purvis' pursuit of Dillinger associates and fellow criminals Homer Van Meter and Baby Face Nelson Also,it was written by Mann, Ronan Bennett and Ann Biderman.A folk hero to the American public thanks to his penchant for robbing the banks that many people believed responsible for the Great Depression, charming bandit Dillinger was virtually unstoppable at the height of his criminal career; no jail could hold him, and his exploits endeared him to the common people while making headlines across the country. J. Edgar Hoover's FBI was just coming into formation, and what better way for the ambitious lawman to transform his fledgling Bureau of Investigation into a national police force than to capture the gang that always gets away? Determined to bust Dillinger and his crew, which also included sociopath Baby Face Nelson and Alvin Karpis, Hoover christened Dillinger the country's very first Public Enemy Number One, and unleashed Purvis to take them down by whatever means necessary. But Purvis underestimated Dillinger's ingenuity as a master criminal, and after embarking on a frantic series of chases and shoot-outs, the dashing agent humbly surmised that he was in over his head. Outwitted and outgunned, Purvis knew that his only hope for busting Dillinger's gang was to baptize a crew of Western ex-lawmen as official agents, and orchestrate a series of betrayals so cunning that even America's criminal mastermind wouldn't know what hit him.This is a film worth seeing as it adheres to the historical facts of Dillinger's well-documented tapestry of brazen daylight heists, gritty shootouts and improbable jailbreaks.It was a thoroughly detailed and engaging crime epic, which traces the criminal exploits and pursuit of infamous gangster.It is a competent and technically impressive gangster flick with charismatic lead performances especially from Johnny Depp and Christian Bale.Although Mann wasn't able to recapture the greatness of Heat,this remains a must-see.",10,1,4,3 October 2012
The Other Boleyn Girl," A Tale Of Two Sisters
","The Other Boleyn Girl is a drama film is a romanticized account of the lives of 16th-century aristocrats Mary Boleyn, one-time mistress of King Henry VIII, and her sister, Queen Anne, who became the monarch's ill- fated second wife, though much history is distorted.It features Natalie Portman,Scarlett Johansson,Eric Bana,Jim Sturgess and Kristin Scott Thomas.Mark Rylance,Ana Torrent,David Morrissey,Eddie Redmayne,Benedict Cumberbatch and Andrew Garfield co-stars.The screenplay by Peter Morgan was adapted from the novel of the same title by Philippa Gregory and it was directed by Justin Chadwick. This period drama follows the fierce competition between sisters Mary and Anne Boleyn to win the affections of Tudor king Henry VIII. Both are under pressure from their father and uncle to help maintain the family's rich legacy and ensure their further prosperity by winning the affections of none other than the king of England. But life in the royal court is far different than it was in the countryside where these two sisters were raised, and before long their bid to earn the love of the king has transformed two once-happy sisters into bitter rivals. At first, it appears that Mary has triumphed in winning the king's favor by becoming his mistress and bearing him an illegitimate child. Despite her early success, however, Mary has underestimated just how clever and cunning her sibling can truly be. Not only does the relentless Anne manage to edge aside her sister in the eyes of King Henry, but she also succeeds in averting his gaze from his wife, Queen Catherine of Aragon, as well. Mary is driven by genuine affection for King Henry, while her sister Anne has only kept up the charade in a desperate bid to become the queen of England. Now, the growing chasm between two sisters is mirrored on a larger scale as England becomes divided more than ever before. As the consequences of their actions threaten to alter the course of an entire nation, these two sisters will ultimately discover that the only place they will find true strength and loyalty is in family.A tale of two sisters competing for the same king, the film uses historical facts as window dressing for this work of fiction that is entertaining, if not wholly believable. Though it features some extravagant and entertaining moments, it feels more like a soap opera than historical drama.But nevertheless,it features an attractive cast and a familiar plot with some icky twists. Kieran McGuigan's cinematography is breathtaking and is as crucial to setting the film's tone as the dialogue.Also,the performances are really good.",9,1,1,27 September 2012
The Danish Girl," Unfortunately,The Danish Girl Refers More To Gerda Rather Than Lili
","Based on the fictional novel written by David Ebershoff and loosely inspired on the lives of Danish painters Einar and Gerda Wegener,The Danish Girl tells a story of their marriage as well as the groundbreaking journey of Gerda's husband Einar Wegener into becoming a transgender Lili Elbe during the 1920's in Denmark.It all started when Gerda asked her husband Einar to pose for her as a female model to do her portraits.What started as a game when Einar started wearing female clothing started to reawaken sudden change of feelings and transformation of sexuality from being male to female.It stars Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander as Einar/Lili and Gerda respectively in a film directed by Tom Hooper.Amanda Beard co- stars as the couple's close female friend.No question that Alicia Vikander deserved winning the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in last year's Academy Awards.Her willingness to take chances in her role as Gerda has somehow made it a great film.Unfortunately,her performance has somewhat took the film into another direction.Instead of the viewers getting to know more of what made Einar become a transgender,they are treated instead of Gerda's undying love for her husband amidst the changes that have gone through him and her full acceptance for it.The viewers saw more in her character's joy and suffering being the husband of Einar/Lili.Well,that is not to take away anything from Eddie Redmayne at all.After watching him from Theory Of Everything wherein he won the Oscar for his role as Stephen Hawking,he definitely did extremely well once again in the dual roles of Einar and the complex Lili where he was definitely credible transgender.He was excellent in terms of its role's complexity.It was just too bad that there was simply a lack of explanation in his role as Lili. I myself would not be fully satisfied that simply wearing female clothing and being dressed up as a woman would make Einar feel extremely comfortable with it and would not want to dress as man once again.Besides,I felt that Einar and Gerda' marriage was picture perfect from their relationship together and so was their sex life.Too bad the viewers were simply asked to accept that this sudden change with little explanation in Einar's psychological make- up as well as his personality too.Even his childhood fantasies related by Hans Axgil wasn't enough.It was evident that his character isn't fully developed.In the end,The Danish Girl became Gerda's film about unrequited love for a husband instead of Einar/Lili to become a landmark transgender film.I somewhat blame the writers for it and Vikander's excellent performance.",9,1,2,26 November 2016
Oldboy," A Korean Masterpiece
","Oldboy is one hell of a movie. It is a film that is characterized by surrealism, gritty violence and raw emotion. The theme is about revenge and how it destroys one person. After viewing it, it left me silent for more than five minutes to contemplate on what I have seen. It was simply a masterpiece. It has proved that Koreans are one of the most creative when it comes to cinema. But mind you, this film is not for everyone. Especially for the weak at heart. Aside from revenge, it touches subject on incest as well. Nevertheless, it is a MASTERPIECE.The acting is world-class in this film. Choi Min-sik and Yu Ji-tae were simply amazing as Oh Daesu and Lee Woo-jin respectively. Credit should also be given to Gang Hye-jung as Mido. The characters are given emotional depth that one could sympathize for. They were not simply categorized as either good or evil but they were allowed to feel raw emotion. The direction was also spectacular from Park Chan-wook. And the soundtrack was mesmerizing. This is definitely a must-see especially for people who love another kind of entertainment. I could have given this a 11 out of 10 rating if only I am allowed to.",10,47,65,26 November 2010

","Filmmaker Paul Verhoeven returned to the Netherlands after more than twenty years of success in Hollywood.This time,he directed this epic- scale war drama based on a true story entitled,Black Book.It is a World War II film about a young Jewish woman in the Netherlands who becomes a spy for the resistance after tragedy befalls her in an encounter with the Nazis.It stars Carice van Houten, Sebastian Koch, Thom Hoffman and Halina Reijn. Apparently,the movie was co-written by Gerard Soeteman together with Verhoeven.The plot revolves around Rachel Steinn.She is a beautiful Jewish woman living in German-occupied Holland during late 1944. Her family members - who have been falsely promised safe passage to Belgium are instead robbed and slaughtered by the Germans on a premeditated basis as Rachel herself manages to escape by diving into the water and swimming away. She narrowly avoids capture, then joins the local resistance movement. With her hair dyed blonde, she can easily pass for Aryan, and when the leader of the Dutch resistance movement learns his son has been captured by Axis forces, Rachel is asked to use her feminine charms to persuade a German commander to arrange for the boy's release. She soon finds herself caught up in a dangerous double life as she becomes a sexual plaything for the Nazis while attempting to bring down their evil empire as a spy. Blackbook is one film that is hard-core with raw violence, intense action, graphic sexuality and a twisting plot that offers a series of surprises.Despite of that,it remains one entertaining melodrama.Verhoeven's film is out of character considering it is tasteful and artistic as based from his previous work.But nevertheless,he manages to pull through as he was able to provide intriguing characters that are morally complex and ambiguous like Stein,who are ordinary people were forced to do extraordinary and even awful for the sake of good of the world and change in the course of history.It also presents a tale of courage and determination in a espionage thriller.Aside from Verhoeven,credit also should be given to Carice van Houten for her excellent performance as Rachel Stein.She was able to provide an intriguing character that was a human being who has her own moral strengths and weaknesses that the viewer could empathize and relate to for she is far from being a heroine figure-types that are expected in these genres of films.It was stated that this Black Book was considered the greatest Dutch film ever made.There is no doubt in my mind that it not pure hype and it truly deserves this credit.",10,4,6,7 December 2011
127 Hours," Appreciation Of Life And Survival
","127 Hours is a film that is based on the life of Aron Ralston,a real-life canyoneer that was trapped by a boulder in an isolated slot canyon located at Blue John Canyon in Utah back in 2003.It stars James Franco as Ralston together with Amber Tamblyn and Kate Mara.It was adapted from the personal memoir of the canyoneer entitled Between A Rock And A Hard Place; and it was co-written,co- produced and directed by Danny Boyle.This is an inspiring story of Aron Ralston's adventure when he becomes trapped in a fallen boulder that crashes on his arm and traps him in isolation.As he tries to escape from his predicament in the next five days,he also discovers virtues that he did not know that he possess such as courage to survive and the ability to escape himself by any means necessary by managing an escape from a trapped 65 foot wall and to ability to hike over 8 miles before he is finally rescued.During the course of his journey,he also realized the value of the people around him like friends,lovers,family and the last two people he had the chance to meet.The movie was definitely touching and truly remarkable as the viewer will definitely appreciate what life is all about.Added to that,we also manage to learn from it that the trials,sufferings and difficulties aren't experienced to put us down but to makes us stronger and better as a human being.Added to that,we also realize that they also provide us opportunities to discover virtues that we once never had as experienced by Ralston who was trapped and experiencing manic desperation. James Franco truly captured what it is to be in that situation and the film made it possible to transform the conditions that he is into realistically. This is definitely one of the best films ever released during its theatrical release and it will remain to be one for many years to come.",10,1,2,5 November 2014
Batman Returns," More Focus On The Villains Than Batman
","Batman Returns is a film directed by Tim Burton. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, it is a sequel to 1989's Batman. Michael Keaton reprises the title role of Bruce Wayne/Batman, Pat Hingle returns as Commissioner Gordon, and Michael Gough returns as Wayne's butler Alfred Pennyworth. The film introduces the characters of Max Shreck,portrayed by Christopher Walken, a megalomaniac business tycoon who teams up with the deformed and deranged Penguin,played by Danny DeVito, to take over Gotham City, as well as the character of Catwoman,played by Michelle Pfeiffer, a wronged secretary named Selina Kyle with mixed motives regarding the Dark Knight.In this film, the Caped Crusader is up against the Penguin, the hideously deformed scion of a wealthy Gotham City family. The Penguin plots with evil businessman Max Schreck to become mayor and then turn Gotham into a cathedral of crime. Upon overhearing these plans, Schreck's mousy secretary Selena Kyle is tossed from a high-rise window by her boss. Rescued by a covey of kittens, Selena transforms into the leather-clad Catwoman. In this guise, she teams with the Penguin and Schreck to divvy up their ill-gotten gains and help discredit Batman-but she also has her own scores to settle.This is less of a sequel than reworking of the first film's themes, with greater attention paid to the villains and more visually inventive set pieces, albeit contained in a less coherent work.Also,the villains' stories put Batman out of the picture and the focus of the movie.But nevertheless,this is an indirect reason why the movie worth watching. Also,the flawless casting of Danny DeVito as The Penguin and Christopher Walken as Max Schreck make the sequel better than the first.",10,6,13,15 September 2012

Creed," A Modern Re-telling Of The Story Of Rocky I
","Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone together with Tessa Thompson star in this film which could be categorized as both a film update and sequel of the Rocky franchise entitled Creed.It tells the story of Adonis 'Donnie' Johnson,who happens to be an illegitimate child of Rocky's opponent in the first two films Apollo Creed from an extra-marital affair.It provides us the details of his life from walking away from his high-paying securities job and rich life and seeks Rocky Balboa in Philadelphia in order to follow the footsteps of his father to pursue a career in boxing.Director Ryan Coogler co-wrote the screenplay which was based from the characters of Stallone's original story in the 1976 classic Rocky. No question that Rocky fans will recognize that story of Adonis has similarities from the first film.That includes the story of an underdog who isn't expected to do well inside the ring, the whole- hearted training given by Adonis in boxing, and his attitude towards life as to never give up no matter what circumstances they encounter.It was also nice to see the seventy year old Rocky himself learn from it after learning that he has cancer.He was ready to die to join the people that are close to him who already passed away such as Mickey,Paulie and his wife Adrian.But in the end,he had to re-learn values that made him a famous and endearing character to movie fans.Finally,we also get to see the events happen in Philadelphia and revisit memorable places when Rocky was to face Apollo decades ago such as Philadelphia Museum of Art and many others.Familiar themes were tackled and places were revisited.Also,the events that took place including the final bout wherein Adonis lost the fight via split decision was definitely far from surprising as viewers probably have expected the same ending of the first film when Rocky did lose the same way to Apollo.In the end,Creed was effective in a modern update of the classic first film.It is also worthy to mention that Stallone finally got an Oscar nomination just like in the first film instead of another Razzie which he normally gets every year for a surprising great performance of an old Rocky. I felt that the film was basically a modern re-telling of the story of Rocky I.If that was Creed's objective,then it has truly succeeded.",9,8,13,17 April 2016
The Great Dictator," Film That Satirize Nazism And Hitler
","The Great Dictator is a comedy film by Charlie Chaplin.Like most Chaplin films, he wrote, produced, and directed, in addition to starring as the lead. Having been the only Hollywood film maker to continue to make silent films well into the period of sound films, this was Chaplin's first true talking picture as well as his most commercially successful film.More importantly, it was the first major feature film to bitterly satirize Nazism and Adolf Hitler.With this pithy opening title, Chaplin begins his first all-talking feature film, The Great Dictator. During World War I, a Jewish barber in the army of Tomania saves the life of high-ranking officer Schultz. While Schultz survives the conflict unscathed, the barber is stricken with amnesia and bundled off to a hospital. Twenty years pass: Tomania has been taken over by dictator Adenoid Hynkel and his stooges Garbitsch and Herring. Hynkel despises all Jews and regularly wreaks havoc on the Tomanian Jewish ghetto, where feisty Hannah lives. Meanwhile, the little barber escapes from the hospital and instinctively heads back to his cobweb-laden ghetto barber shop. Unaware of Hynkel's policy towards Jews (in fact, he's unaware of Hynkel), the barber gets into a slapstick confrontation with a gang of Aryan storm troopers. He is rescued by his old friend Schultz, now one of Hynkel's most loyal officers. Thanks to Schultz's protection, the ghetto receives a brief respite from Hynkel's persecution. The barber sets up shop again, developing a warm platonic relationship with the lovely Hannah. But things take a sorry turn when Hynkel, angered that a Jewish banker has refused to finance his impending war with Austerlitz, begins bearing down again on the Ghetto. Near the end of the film, when the dictator is expected to make another one of his hate-filled, war-mongering speeches, the barber steps up to the microphones...and Charles Chaplin drops character and becomes 'himself,' delivering an impassioned plea for peace, tolerance, and humanity.Like all major Chaplin works, The Great Dictator was a cheaply, but methodically, made film, a cardboard act of humanist defiance, and, thanks to its purity of purpose, the cheesier the jokes get, the harder they land.Aside from that,The first full-blown talkie from the biggest star of the silent era, complete with a message that he couldn't have sent more loudly or clearly.Finally,the film hasn't aged well, but in 1940 it was perceived to be original, bold and controversial due to its combination of slapstick satire of the German dictator.It is one of the best films ever made in cinema history.",10,3,5,27 February 2012
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," How To Lose A Movie In 100 Minutes
","How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days is a romantic comedy film that stars Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey. It is loosely based on the self-help book of the same name (subtitled The Universal Don't of Dating) written by Michele Alexander and Jeannie Long.The movie was directed by Donald Petrie.Andie (Hudson) is a young journalist who longs to cover political stories, but in the meantime she finds herself writing for a women's magazine called Composure, where her editor Lana Jong has her writing a fluffy advice column. After hearing of the latest dating laments of her relationship-challenged friend Michelle, Andie sells Lana on the idea of writing a piece on the things women do to alienate the men they love, which she'll demonstrate by winning and then driving away a man in a mere ten days. Meanwhile, Ben (McConaughey) is an advertising man who wants to land a prestige diamond account at his firm. Ben is competing with his pals, Spears and Green, for the assignment, so Ben tells his boss Phillip Warren that he's the man for the job because he understands the fair sex so well he can make any woman fall for him in less than two weeks. As fate would have it, Andie and Ben end up choosing one another for their mutual assignments, with neither knowing about each other's secret agenda as Ben strives to hold on to Andie while she does everything in her power to annoy him.The bad thing about this movie is that it is far from realistic.Both Ben and Andie tried to be awful with one another and yet they fall for each other.Why?What's the reason for them to fall for each other when they were certainly creeps with one another for most part - 100 minutes - of the film? The only reason I could think of is the requirements of the plot especially for a chick flick and a romantic comedy at that.Also,the premise looks good on the screenplay but it was poorly executed in the movie as it looks absolutely implausible.Also,there was an apparent lack of chemistry between the lead stars - Hudson and McConaughey.The only good thing about them is that they are pleasing to the eye and good to look at in the entire movie.And most of all,it relied heavily on clichés and contrivances that are preeminent on romantic comedies.It should have relied on jokes and laughs for it to be more effective instead of the reason stated in the previous sentence.Finally,the game of 'Bullsh*t' was played towards the end of the movie.Instead of that crude humor being used for them to get together,the writers should have been a little more creative than that.The conclusion just looked empty and fabricated in the end.",6,1,2,14 September 2012
Alexander," Never Lived Up To Its Potential
","Alexander is an epic film based on the life of Alexander the Great. It was directed by Oliver Stone, with Colin Farrell in the title role together with Angelina Jolie,Val Kilmer,Jared Leto,Rosario Dawson and Anthony Hopkins. The film was an original screenplay based in part on the book Alexander the Great, written by historian Robin Lane Fox.The film is based on the life of Alexander the Great, King of Macedon, who conquered Asia Minor, Egypt, Persia and part of Ancient India. Shown are some of the key moments of Alexander's youth, his invasion of the mighty Persian Empire and his death. It also outlines his early life, including his difficult relationship with his father Philip II of Macedon, his strained feeling towards his mother Olympias, the unification of the Greek city-states and the two Greek Kingdoms - Macedon and Epirus - under the Hellenic League,and the conquest of the Persian Empire in 331 BC. It also details his plans to reform his empire and the attempts he made to reach the end of the then known world.The movie gives us some truly stirring visuals and music that soars but performances that not so believable and credible.At a reported cost of $155 million, it qualifies as a super-spectacle in every respect except for Colin Farrell is woefully miscast in the lead.We barely get any substance on who Alexander is all about.Also,the film is a disaster on an epic scale for it is sprawling, messy and incoherent.In the end,it simply never lived up to its potential.",7,1,2,10 September 2012
Constantine," Cheesy Popcorn Entertainment
","Constantine is an action horror film directed by Francis Lawrence as his directorial debut.It stars Keanu Reeves as John Constantine,together with with Rachel Weisz, Shia LaBeouf, Tilda Swinton, and Djimon Hounsou. The film is based on Vertigo Comics' Hellblazer comic book.Constantine portrays the lead character,John Constantine as a cynic with the ability to perceive and communicate with half-angels and half-demons in their true form. He seeks salvation from eternal damnation in Hell for a suicide attempt in his youth. Constantine exorcises demons back to Hell in a bid to earn favor with Heaven but has become weary over time. With death looming, he helps a troubled police detective learn the truth about her sister's death while simultaneously unraveling a much larger and darker plot.Constantine solid production values and an intriguing premise but it lacks focus to be interesting,absorbing and engaging.It has a messy script that even talented cast involved like Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz can't save this movie from boredom.Overall,Constantine turns out to be a cheesy popcorn entertainment despite having supernaturals and spirituals involved in the story.",7,1,2,8 November 2011

It is inspired partly by the novella The Turn of the Screw.The music as well as the screenplay and direction was by Alejandro Amenábar.It tells the story of Grace, a devoutly religious mother of two ailing children who has moved with her family to a mansion on the English coast while awaiting her husband's return from World War II, though he has been declared missing. Their children, Anne and Nicholas, both suffer from a rare photosensitive disease that renders them extremely vulnerable to sunlight, prompting Grace's rule of having only one door open in the house at a time. When Anne begins claiming to see ghosts, Grace at first believes her newly arrived family of eccentric servants to be responsible, but chilling events and visions soon lead her to believe that something supernatural is indeed going on.The Others is another type of horror film with an unbelievable twist.It was engaging and absorbing from beginning to end.Also,it is definitely far from being clichéd and formulaic as the viewer may find oneself completely astounded and fascinated at the last scenes of the film.Aside from its unbelievable twist,one cannot help about the music,screenplay and direction by Amenábar as well as the brilliant performances of the cast especially by Kidman.Overall,it is one-of-a-kind horror film that clearly exhibits Amenábar's genius in film-making.",10,2,4,12 November 2011
Troy," Troy Is An Epic War Film
","Troy is an epic war film that was loosely based on Homer's Iliad. It features an ensemble cast that includes Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom and Diane Kruger together with Sean Bean, Brian Cox, Brendan Gleeson, Rose Byrne, Garrett Hedlund, Tyler Mane, and Peter O'Toole. It was written by David Benioff and directed by Wolfgang Petersen.In 1193 B.C., Paris, Prince of Troy, has fallen in love; however, the beautiful woman who has beguiled him is Helen, Queen of Sparta,who is wed to King Menelaus. While Helen is hardly immune to Paris' charms, this doesn't blunt Menelaus' fury when Paris steals her away from him. Menelaus' brother Agamemnon,the power-hungry king of the Mycenaeans, is eager to expand his empire through Troy to the lands of the Aegean Sea, and he uses Paris' romantic slight against Menelaus as an excuse to wage an all-out war against the great walled city. Priam, King of Troy, summons his armies, led by Prince Hector, to meet the onslaught of Agamemnon's forces, but while the great city has yet to yield in a battle, Agamemnon has a formidable ally in Achilles,a mighty and seemingly unstoppable warrior whose presence could tip the scales in Agamemnon's favor. The movie is visually stunning regardless of the its overblown and historically inaccurate depiction as a gigantic city of massive columns and statuary. Character dynamics are intense.The epic-scale narrative is now easy to follow, with greater emphasis on the inner turmoil of Achilles,which was well played by Brad Pitt; and his rivalry with Hector.Also,viewers will feel a more satisfying escalation of tension and suspense from battle to battle. The good parts are better, and the not-so-good parts are more easily forgiven. And no matter how you cut it,the film is a lavish feast for the eyes.",9,1,1,27 September 2012

It stars Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal, Anne Hathaway and Michelle Williams.It was directed by Ang Lee.Jack and Ennis met at a job tending sheep at Brokeback Mountain one summer and felt one day that they are very much in love with one another.Unfortunately,the year was 1963 and society was less open to acceptance of gay relationships.So after the experience they had,Jack and Ennis moved on to continuing their SECRET relationship despite of getting married and having children in the years to come.Brokeback Mountain explores a relationship that is not meant to be considering its implications to society and the complexities brought about by their relationship to their families.It moved me in the sense that their is a forbidden love whose passion maybe comparable only to that of William Shakespeare's characters - Romeo and Juliet.There is sadness and anxiety to it.Also,there is a feeling of involvement considering how limited it can be.The movie has won four well-deserved Golden Globes including Best Picture.Ang Lee definitely has superb direction as the movie's story unfolds that we feel sympathy to the characters involved especially Ennis and Jack.Also,Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are great as Ennis and Jack respectively .Heath Ledger definitely was the star of this film as he was able to bring complexity to Ennis' character.His Golden Globe nomination is well deserved.This is the best movie of the year and I hope that it wins the Best Picture award at the Oscars.",10,4,4,13 October 2011
Ed Wood," A Classic Comedic Biopic
","Hollywood visionary Tim Burton pays homage to another Hollywood visionary, albeit a less successful one, in this unusual fictionalized biography entitled Ed Wood.This comedy-drama biopic directed and produced by Tim Burton.It features Johnny Depp as cult filmmaker in the title role. The film's story concerns the period in Wood's life when he made his best-known films as well as his relationship with actor Bela Lugosi, played by Martin Landau. Sarah Jessica Parker, Patricia Arquette, Jeffrey Jones, Lisa Marie, and Bill Murray co-star who play key supporting roles.It was conceived by writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski.The film follows Ed Wood in his quest for film greatness as he writes and directs turkey after turkey, cross-dresses, and surrounds himself with a motley crew of Hollywood misfits, outcasts, has-beens, and never- weres. The real story, however, is his friendship with aging, morphine- addicted Bela Lugosi, whom he tries to help stage a comeback. Tim Burton and Johnny Depp team up to fete the life and work of cult hero Ed Wood, with typically strange and wonderful results.Martin Landau's unforgettable Oscar-winning performance must be seen to be believed, as must Rick Baker's Oscar-winning makeup. While it would have been easy to make a film simply ridiculing the bumbling director, Burton instead focuses on his driving passion for film making and his unwavering persistence in the face of ridicule and failure. Possibly the most surprising aspect of the film is the genuine sentiment with which Burton treats the relationship between Wood and Lugosi; his devotion to Lugosi is touching, as is Lugosi's final soliloquy which is an inane bit of dialogue from the hilariously bad Bride of the Monster that grows into a poignant metaphor for the actor's life and ultimate triumph of his spirit. Even the look of the film is right; it manages to preserve the air of one of Wood's own films while retaining a sense of artistry in much of the composition on screen.And added to that,it's black and white photography convincingly recaptures the look and feel of 1950's sleaze, including some of the least convincing special effects in movie history.It is a classic indeed.",10,1,1,19 October 2012

Spotlight," Spotlight Delivers
","No question that this Academy Award winning film Spotlight is one of the best films not only during the year it was released but for many years to come. This Oscar winner which features the Boston Globe's 'Spotlight' team tells us us how the oldest continuously operating newspaper's group of investigative journalist unit in the United States came up with its investigation of the cases of pederasty that committed by numerous Roman Catholic priests at Boston,Massachusetts.It stars a talented ensemble of actors and actresses in Mark Ruffalo,Michael Keaton,Rachel McAdams,Liev Schreiber,John Slattery,Brian d'Arcy James and Stanley Tucci. It was based on a series of stories by the said team that enabled the newspaper to win the Pulitzer Prize back in 2003.What makes the film is great is numerous.First,we get to see great performances from its ensemble cast.They portrayed the real-life characters sincerely and accurately.The film did not fall into the trap of trying to maximize the good qualities nor magnify their achievements as well as the hard work they put forth into the newspaper unit.Second,the subject of investigation wasn't really an abomination of the Catholic Church as other films with similar themes do portray.It only reflected the priests who were assigned at Boston.Third,it provides the viewer of what a newspaper should be all about in reporting news and doing investigation like the 'Spotlight' team.It was obviously not created to sensationalize topics they are investigating for better profit reports but rather for moral urgency and their responsibility to report the truth to the reading public.It also tried to stay away from what most newspapers have become these days and how the team remained true to their identity.In summary,this would make us appreciate them better and it gives investigative journalists a good name.",10,1,2,30 May 2016

It had an interesting premise and had visual effects that provides entertainment especially for its film franchise hardcore fans.There was increase in graphic violence. Too bad that it lacks the heart of the original Terminator and the other sequels. Added to that,the film was obviously lacking in terms of the storyline. Overall,it just focused on the effects and to give the viewer a fun ride but it ultimately forgot the heart of the film franchise.",7,1,1,14 December 2019

As Finch plays a dangerous game of extortion with Dormer, the detective's mental health deteriorates rapidly from guilt over his complicity in a crime and sleep deprivation compounded by the lack of darkness in the land of the midnight sun. Meanwhile, the bright and dogged Ellie continues putting the pieces of a complex puzzle together despite Dormer's skillful attempts to lead the investigation toward the right suspect, but away from his own malfeasance.Insomnia proves once again why Christopher Nolan is one of the best directors we have today.It was well-made,well-written,stylish and truly enigmatic that does not lack tension,drama and suspense.It was a thriller whose style, structure and rhythms are so integrated with the story, you cannot separate them.It was interesting from beginning to end especially with Pacino,who delivers one of the best performances,as the insomniac police detective who makes the picture interesting.He was outstanding that we are able to sympathize with the moral complexities of his character.Aside from him,special mention also goes to Williams as the child murders who was excellent with his scenes with Pacino and Hillary Swank,who was never left behind with the great acting abilities of his co-stars.This is an great excellent film that one should never miss.",10,1,1,30 November 2011

Like most films released by Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli, this family- oriented feature has a powerful ecological theme. The English-language version of this film wasn't dubbed until many years later, explaining the presence of actors such as Dakota Fanning in the cast.This is one of the best animated films ever made for families: it celebrates feminine sensitivity, the importance of the spirit world, respect for nature, and the pre-eminence of the spiritual practice of kindness.

Juno," Juno Excels On Its Theme About Teen-Age Pregnancy
","When she becomes unexpectedly pregnant by a guy pal, a 16-year-old girl in small-town Minnesota decides to give her baby to the 'perfect' couple she locates from the classified ads, only to discover that the impending adoption is pushing them towards divorce and causing her to fall in love with the biological father of the child in this movie,Juno. Ellen Page stars as the title character, an independent-minded teenager confronting an unplanned pregnancy and the subsequent events that put pressures of adult life onto her. Michael Cera, Olivia Thirlby, J. K. Simmons, Allison Janney, Jennifer Garner, and Jason Bateman also star.It was written by Diablo Cody and directed by Jason Reitman.

With a little help from Leah, Juno soon comes into contact with Mark and Vanessa,who happens to be an affluent suburban couple who have been unable to conceive a child of their own.

L.A. Confidential," An Enjoyable Treat For Lovers Of Good Movies
","L.A. Confidential is a neo-noir film based on James Ellroy's novel of the same title, the third book in his L.A. Quartet. Both the book and the film tell the story of a group of LAPD officers in the year 1953, and the intersection of police corruption and Hollywood celebrity. The film adaptation was produced and directed by Curtis Hanson and co- written by Hanson and Brian Helgeland.At the time, actors Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe were relatively unknown in North America, and one of the film's backers, Peter Dennett, was worried about the lack of established stars in the lead roles. However, he supported Hanson's casting decisions and this gave the director the confidence to approach Kevin Spacey, Kim Basinger, and Danny DeVito.This award-winning crime drama explores both the dark side of the Los Angeles police force and Southern California's criminal underbelly in the early '50s, when Hollywood was still seen as America's capital of sophistication, glitter, and glamour. Dudley Smith is the head of the LAPD and is loyal to his officers and eager to turn a blind eye to violence or corruption within his department, as long as it's the 'bad guys' who are getting hurt. Bud White is a police detective whose violent and cynical nature is often at war with his basic sense of decency and justice. Ed Exley is a beat cop-turned-detective whose strict by-the-book philosophy and willingness to blow the whistle on other officers is balanced by a shrewd and opportunistic understanding of the internal politics of the department. And Jack Vincennes is a flashy 'Hollywood' detective who serves as technical adviser for the TV series Badge of Honor. He is also in cahoots with Sid Hudgeons, publisher of the scandal sheet Hush Hush, who throws kickbacks to Vincennes in exchange for being brought along when showbiz figures get busted. White, Exley, and Vincennes find themselves drawn into a tangled and sticky web of violence and betrayal following a multiple murder at a coffee shop that is believed to be part of an effort by Mickey Cohen to consolidate his hold on organized crime in L.A. This lead appears to be connected to the discovery of a bizarre pornography and call-girl ring operated by Pierce Patchett, whose women are given plastic surgery so that they more closely resemble well-known movie stars. White's role in the investigation is complicated when he falls for Lynn Bracken, one of Patchett's prostitutes, who is the spitting image of Veronica Lake.You have to pay close attention to follow the double-crossing intricacies of the plot, but the reward for your work is dark and dirty fun.With its plot that zigs and zags like knife slashes, its cynicism stoked to the melting point, the movie brings the thrill of corruption crackingly to life.Also,it is an irresistible treat with enough narrative twists and memorable characters for a half-dozen films.In summary,this film has taut pacing, brilliantly dense writing and Oscar- worthy acting combine to produce a smart, popcorn-friendly thrill ride.",10,1,2,25 February 2012
Concussion," Concussion Could Have Been A Better Film
","No question about it.Concussion could have been a better film. Will Smith was obviously disappointed that he never was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal as Dr. Bennett Omalu.While I may say that he did a wonderful performance as the leading character,too bad that the film decided to make safe approaches which unfortunately weakened the film. The film directed by Peter Landesman was set back in 2002.At this time,a Nigerian forensic pathologist in Dr. Omalu discovered a brain injury known as Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) which occurs to National Football League players after he did an autopsy on former Pittsburgh Steelers center Mike Webster,who was found dead in his pickup truck.After releasing a report on the said findings on the degeneration of the brain that is highly possible for football players,he fights a battle against the league to suppress his research on it.Too bad that instead of focusing on the topic CTE or the football players who are prone to the said disease,it took safe approaches by dealing more on the life of Dr.Omalu.Unfortunately,viewers are more interested in both the brain injury as well as the most popular sport in the United States.Dealing more on the doctor makes it less interesting.It could have been a better film had it not done that.Also,it would also be more revealing on how the sport could be indeed very dangerous to the brain and one's mental health just like when cigarettes were first discovered as dangerous to one's health decades ago.",9,2,4,30 May 2016
The Day After Tomorrow," Global Warming Disaster Flick
","The Day After Tomorrow is a science fiction disaster flick depicting catastrophic effects of global warming in a series of extreme weather events that usher in global cooling and leads to a new ice age.Directed by Roland Emmerich, this mega-budget, special-effects-laden epic revolves around the onset of an international series of crises brought on by the long-term results of the greenhouse effect.It stars Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal together with Emmy Rossum,Ian Holm and Sela Ward.It was co-written by Jeffrey Nachmanoff and Emmerich himself.At the eye of the storm is paleoclimatologist,Jack Hall voluntarily takes on the preservation of the world in the dawn of the next ice age and all the disaster that comes along with it such as violent hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, tidal waves, massive floods and the likes. Hall must also contact his son Sam, who was in the middle of an academic competition in New York City when the chaos begun. In addition to facing the largest-scale onslaught of natural catastrophes in the history of humankind, Jack, in his journey north, must contend with the masses fleeing south in an attempt to resettle in a warmer climate.Supreme silliness doesn't stop The Day After Tomorrow from being lots of fun for connoisseurs of epic-scale disaster commercial film.Obviously,this is a ludicrous but an entertaining flick filled with clunky dialogues, but spectacular visuals save it from being a total disaster. Director Roland Emmerich uses global warming as a politically correct excuse for destroying most of the northern hemisphere. Like most of his films, this one emphasizes special effects over such lesser priorities as well-drawn characters and plausible plotting, and his dialogue is so laughably trite that it could be entirely eliminated without harming the movie. It's the spectacle that's important here, not the lame, recycled plot about father and son that endure an end-of-the-world scenario caused by the effects of global warming. Enjoy the awesome visions of tornado-ravaged Los Angeles, blizzards in New Delhi, Japan pummeled by grapefruit-sized hailstones, and Manhattan flooded by swelling oceans and then frozen by the onset of a modern ice age in this disaster film that practically offers nothing new.",8,1,2,27 September 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," A Franchise In The Verge Of Collapse
","Director Gore Verbinski and the crew set sail once again for this, the third chapter in the swashbuckling Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy in this movie entitled,Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End.It features Johnny Depp,Orlando Bloom,Keira Knightley,Geoffrey Rush,Bill Nighy,Stellan Skarsgård together with Chow Yun-fat,Jack Davenport,Kevin R. McNally,Naomie Harris,Tom Hollander and Jonathan Pryce.The plot follows Will Turner, Elizabeth Swann, and the crew of the Black Pearl rescuing Captain Jack Sparrow, from Davy Jones's Locker, and then preparing to fight the East India Trading Company,led by Cutler Beckett and Davy Jones, who plan to extinguish piracy. Captain Jack Sparrow is hopelessly trapped in Davy Jones' locker after a harrowing encounter with the dreaded Kracken, and now Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann must align themselves with the nefarious Captain Barbossa if they hold out any hope of saving their old friend from a fate worse than death. The East India Trading Company and its fearsome leader, Lord Cutler Beckett, have taken control of the ghostly Flying Dutchman and its captain, Davy Jones, and now the baleful Admiral Norrington has taken the helm in a relentless bid to destroy every pirate ship in his path and bring the Age of Piracy to a violent close. Meanwhile, Will, Elizabeth, and Captain Barbossa navigate treacherous waters and face bitter betrayal as they set sail to gather the only army that can stand up to Beckett which is The Nine Lords of the Brethren Court. But Captain Jack Sparrow is one of the lords, and as long as he's stuck in Davy Jones' locker, Beckett and his nefarious armada are sure to emerge victorious. There's still hope, however, if the heroic team that includes Tia Dalma, Pintel, and Ragetti can reach exotic Singapore and convince vulpine pirate Sao Feng to provide them with charts and a ship. But even the powerful Brethren Court may need a bit of help from volatile sea goddess Calypso in order to weather the coming storm. With the entire future of the pirate way at stake, everyone will be forced to choose sides while drifting precariously to the edge of the earth for one final, spectacular battle.The film provides the thrilling action scenes, but mixes in too many characters with too many incomprehensible plot threads.In addition to that,it is a hearty, bumpy sea marathon.For some viewers, it will be a fun ride.But for others, it will be an ordeal.The plot is not only hard to follow, there seems to be nothing real at stake. Half the characters are already dead, and half the movie seems to involve sword fights with dead people who can't be killed with swords.The entire franchise seems on the verge of collapse, propelled to construct ever more grandiose flights of fancy. Without those sequences, there would be nothing in here.",8,1,2,21 October 2012
Spider-Man 3," A Great Addition To The Spiderman Movie Franchise
","Your friendly neighborhood web-slinger is back, only this time his sunny outlook has become partially overcast in the third chapter of director Sam Raimi's Spiderman saga in this movie entitled,Spiderman 3. Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco return to reprise their roles from the previous two installments, with Thomas Haden Church, Topher Grace, and Bryce Dallas Howard making their first appearances in the series as Flint Marko,Eddie Brock and Gwen Stacy respectively.James Cromwell,Rosemary Harris and J. K. Simmons co-star to play supporting roles.Peter Parker has finally leaned to walk the middle ground between being the superhero that his city needs and the man that Mary Jane loves. All is well in New York City until one night, as Peter and M.J. sit gazing at the stars, a falling comet streams across the sky and crashes into the ground close by. But this isn't any ordinary shooting star, and upon impact the mysterious space rock is split open to reveal a shape- shifting symbiotic with the power to overtake anything that it comes into contact with. Later, as Harry Osborn acquires his late father's flying board, engineers a powerful new Goblin outfit, and takes to the sky to avenge dad's death, the mysterious space sludge infects both Peter's Spider-Man suit and ambitious street photographer Eddie Brock. Peter's strange new suit gives him a new found sense of power as it gradually overpowers his personality, and he discovers that escaped convict Flint Marko was in fact the man responsible for the death of Uncle Ben.Unfortunately for Peter, Marko has recently acquired the power to morph at will and quickly completes his transformation into the dreaded Sandman. As the Sandman gives in to his darkest criminal instincts and the slithering space symbiotic transforms Eddie Brock into the nightmarish fanged villain known as Venom, the citizens of New York City must once again call on Spider-Man to fend off destructive forces that are far too powerful for the likes of mortal man.How does Spider-Man 3 follow on the heels of its predecessor, which was widely considered the best superhero movie ever? For starters, you pick up the loose threads from that movie, then add some key elements of the Spidey comic-book myths, the black costume, and the characters of Gwen Stacy and her police-captain father. In the beginning, things have never looked better for Peter Parker: He's doing well in school; his alter ego, Spiderman, is loved and respected around New York City. And his girlfriend, Mary Jane Watson, has just taken a starring role in a Broadway musical. But nothing good can last for Spidey. Mary Jane's career quickly goes downhill; she's bothered by Peter's attractive new classmate, Gwen Stacy; and the new Daily Bugle photographer, Eddie Brock, is trying to steal his thunder. Enter a new villain, the Sandman, who can transform his body into various forms and shapes of sand and who may be connected to Peter's past in an unexpected way. There's also the son of an old villain, Harry Osborne,who unmasked Spidey in the previous movie and still has revenge on his mind. And a new black costume seems to boost Spidey's powers, but transforms mild-mannered Peter into a mean and obnoxious boor.If that sounds like a lot to pack into one 140-minute movie, it is.This is seriously overextended, with four distinct subplots and way too much hand-wringing over things like the heroine's singing career. While director Sam Raimi keeps things flowing, assisted on the screenplay by his brother Ivan and Alvin Sargent, there's a little too much going on, and it's inevitable that one of the four villains gets significantly short-changed. Still, the cast is excellent.Also,the effects are fantastic. And the action is fast and furious. Even if Spiderman 3 isn't the match from its predecessors as isn't quite as refined as the first two, it's a worthy addition to the mega-million dollar Spiderman franchise.",9,6,8,15 October 2012
Match Point," Woody Allen's Best Film In Many Years
","A clandestine love affair sends one man's charmed life into a tailspin in this dark, disturbing drama written and directed by Woody Allen entitled Match Point.It stars Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Scarlett Johansson, Emily Mortimer, Matthew Goode, Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton.Chris Wilton is an Irish tennis player with an impoverished background. Just accomplished enough to make his way onto the professional circuit, but not skilled enough to be a consistent winner, he now works as an instructor at a London tennis club. The wealthy Tom Hewett, who is as impressed by Chris's charm and good looks as he is by his game, takes a tennis lesson from the young man. Chris's intelligence and wit also make a strong impression on Tom's pretty sister, Chloe, who soon falls for him. It isn't long before Chris and Chloe are engaged to be married, a match that pleases both Tom and his father, Alec, a successful businessman who believes Chris has a bright future in his firm. However, Chris also feels an overwhelming attraction to Nola Rice, a sexy blonde from the United States who is dating Tom. Though Nola initially puts up some resistance, Chris gently nudges her in the direction of an affair. Passion soon ignites between the two, and they have a one-time sexual encounter, even as Chris and Chloe plan their wedding. Nola resists, however, when Chris makes additional attempts to wheedle her into bed. Nola drops out of Chris's life shortly before his wedding, but a chance meeting a few months later resurrects the relationship as Chris and Chloe try to start a family.This lean, mean, surprisingly sultry thriller about fate, luck, greed and guilt is Woody Allen's best since Mighty Aphrodite.It has a winning combination of sex, mystery, brilliant writing and first-rate acting that all adds up to one of the most erotic and exhilarating movies Allen has done.It is one of his sharpest films in many years.",10,2,3,1 October 2012
Yes Man," Message About Change Remains Timeless
","Yes Man is a romantic comedy directed by Peyton Reed and it was written by Nicholas Stoller, Jarrad Paul, and Andrew Mogel.It stars Jim Carrey, Zooey Deschanel, Bradley Cooper, John Michael Higgins, Rhys Darby, Maile Flanagan, Danny Masterson, and Terence Stamp. It is based loosely on the book of the same title by British humorist Danny Wallace.Carrey stars as Los Angeles bank loan officer Carl Allen has become withdrawn since his divorce from ex-wife Stephanie. Routinely ignoring his friends Pete and Rooney,he has an increasingly negative outlook on his life. One day, an old colleague suggests that he goes to a 'Yes!' seminar with him, which encourages its attendants to seize the opportunity to say 'Yes!'. Carl considers the option, but subsequently misses Pete's engagement party. An irate Pete turns up at his house and berates him, telling him that he will end up completely lonely if he does not change his life. Carl decides to attend the seminar and meets inspirational guru Terrence Bundley, who publicly browbeats him into making a covenant with himself. Carl reluctantly promises to stop being a 'No Man' and vows to answer 'Yes!' to every opportunity, request or invitation that presents itself thereafter.There are flat performances in the film.The only exception is that of Jim Carrey's comic convulsions which are the only bright spots in this otherwise dim and predictable comedy.Also,it has false situations and bad lines, but the laughs are there and the message about change and personal transformation are timeless.",10,1,2,6 September 2012
Zodiac," It Is A Great Film
","Zodiac is a mystery film directed by David Fincher and based on Robert Graysmith's non-fiction book of the same name. It stars Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, and Robert Downey, Jr.Zodiac tells the story of the hunt for a notorious serial killer known as 'Zodiac' who killed in and around the San Francisco Bay Area during the late 1960s and early 1970s, leaving several victims in his wake and taunting police with letters and ciphers mailed to newspapers.A relentless serial killer is stalking the streets of the San Francisco Bay Area, leaving citizens locked into a constant state of panic, and baffled authorities scrambling for clues. Though the killer sadistically mocks the detectives by leaving a series of perplexing ciphers and menacing letters at the crime scenes, the investigation quickly flatlines when none of the evidence yields any solid leads. As two detectives remain steadfast in their devotion to bringing the elusive killer to justice, they soon find that the madman has control not only over their careers, but their very lives as well. The case remains one of San Francisco's most infamous unsolved crimes.The true story behind the murders that many crime scholars believe to be the most perplexing series of unsolved crimes in modern history comes to the screen in chilling detail.A quiet, dialogue-driven thriller that delivers with scene after scene of gut-wrenching anxiety. David Fincher also spends more time illustrating nuances of his characters and recreating the mood of the 70s than he does on gory details of murder.Also,what makes Zodiac authentic is the way it avoids chases, shootouts, grandstanding and false climaxes, and just follows the methodical progress of police work. In summary,this is one great film.",10,2,3,3 September 2012
Milk," A Look At A Man Who Defined An Era
","Academy Award winner Sean Penn takes the title role in this biopic tracing the last eight years in the life of Harvey Milk, the ill-fated politician and gay activist whose life changed history, and whose courage still inspires people.Directed by Gus Van Sant and written by Dustin Lance Black, Milk stars Sean Penn in the title role.Emile Hirsch,Josh Brolin,Diego Luna and James Franco co-star to play key supporting roles. Attempts to put Milk's life to film followed a 1984 documentary of his life and the aftermath of his assassination, titled The Times of Harvey Milk, which was loosely based upon Randy Shilts's biography, The Mayor of Castro Street.When Harvey Milk was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977, he made history for being the first openly gay man in American history to be voted into public office. But the rights of homosexuals weren't Milk's primary concern, as tellingly evidenced by the wide array of political coalitions he formed over the course of his tragically brief career. He fought for everyone from union workers to senior citizens, a true hero of human rights who possessed nothing but compassion for his fellow man. The story begins in New York City, where a 40-year-old Milk ponders what steps he can take to make his life more meaningful. Eventually, Milk makes the decision to relocate to the West Coast, where he and his lover, Scott Smith found a small business in the heart of a working-class neighborhood. Empowered by his love for the Castro neighborhood and the success of his business, Castro Camera, Milk somewhat unexpectedly begins to emerge as an outspoken agent for change. With a growing support system that includes both Scott and a like-minded young activist named Cleve Jones, the charismatic Milk decides to take a fateful leap into politics, eventually developing a reputation as a leader who isn't afraid to follow up his words with actions. In short order, he is elected supervisor for the newly zoned District 5, though this seeming triumph is in fact the catalyst for a tragedy that starts to unfold as Milk does his best to forge a political partnership with Dan White, another newly elected supervisor. Over time it becomes apparent that Milk and White's political agendas are directly at odds, a revelation that puts their personal destinies on a catastrophic collision course. When a famous person, like the nation's first openly gay male city supervisor, inspires an acclaimed book and Oscar-winning documentary, a biopic can seem superfluous at best. Taking over from Oliver Stone and Bryan Singer,Van Sant directs with such grace and he renders the concern moot.Added to that, Milk is an agitprop fantasy about the selflessness of sainthood. If anybody but Penn was playing the saint, we'd probably feel as if we were being sold a bill of goods. Instead, he just about pulls it off. Such is the treachery of talent.Also,a poignant lesson about the ripples of impact one impassioned individual can have, regardless of sexual orientation, and regardless of the cause.And finally,it provides the the inspiration Milk gave to hundreds, then thousands, then, posthumously, millions which basically imparts a poignant lesson about the ripples of impact one impassioned individual can have, regardless of sexual orientation, and regardless of the cause.Truly,this is a masterpiece that provides passionate look back at the man who helped define a specific era.",10,1,3,16 October 2012
The Prestige," Rival Stage Magicians
","The Prestige is a British-American mystery thriller film written, directed and co-produced by Christopher Nolan, with a screenplay adapted from Christopher Priest's novel of the same name. The story follows Robert Angier and Alfred Borden, rival stage magicians in London at the end of the 19th century. Obsessed with creating the best stage illusion, they engage in competitive one-upmanship with tragic results.The film features Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier, Christian Bale as Alfred Borden, and David Bowie as Nikola Tesla. It also stars Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, Piper Perabo, Rebecca Hall, and Andy Serkis. Priest's epistolary novel was adapted to the screen by Nolan and his brother, Jonathan Nolan, using nonlinear narrative structure. Obsession, jealousy, and deceit define the tense relationship shared between two turn-of-the-century magicians in Memento and Batman Begins director Christopher Nolan's dizzying tale of sleight of hand. Rupert Angier and Alfred Borden are London-based magicians of the highest order, both blessed with spectacular powers of deception and both cursed with unrelenting envy for one another's skills. When Alfred performs an awe-inspiring trick for which there seems no logical explanation, the friendly competition shared between the pair turns to deadly rivalry as the enraged Rupert determines to uncover his rival's deepest secrets. In the world of illusion, however, nothing is ever quite as it seems, and the rules of the physical world simply don't apply. Now, as bitter competition quickly begins to consume the souls of both performers, the firestorm birthed by their anger threatens to consume all who surround them. It's quite a movie -- atmospheric, obsessive, almost satanic.It is never less than engaging, though considering that the title The Prestige refers to the moment in a magic act that gives it its 'wow' factor, it's kind of a shame that the ultimate 'reveal' in the movie is a little too tricky for its own good.Jackman and Bale give standout performances as rivals whose mutual obsession destroys all sense of perspective and ruins lives.Overall,full of twists and turns, it is a dazzling period piece that never stops challenging the audience.",10,1,2,25 February 2012
The Terminator," A Major Influence In Future Sci-Fi And Action Films
","The Terminator is a science fiction action film directed by James Cameron, co-written by Cameron, Gale Anne Hurd and William Wisher Jr. and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Michael Biehn, and Linda Hamilton. Schwarzenegger plays the Terminator, a cyborg assassin sent back in time from the year 2029 to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor, played by Hamilton. Biehn plays Kyle Reese, a soldier from the future sent back in time to protect Sarah.Endlessly imitated, The Terminator made the reputation of co-writer/director James Cameron and solidified the stardom of Arnold Schwarzenegger.Kyle Reese is a member of the human resistance movement, is teleported back to 1984. His purpose: to rescue Sarah Connor, the mother of the man who will lead the 21st-century rebels against the tyrannical machines, from being assassinated before she can give birth. Likewise thrust back to 1984 is The Terminator, a grim, well-armed, virtually indestructible cyborg who has been programmed to eliminate Sarah Connor. After killing two 'Sarah Connors' who turn out to be the wrong women, he finally aims his gunsights at the genuine article.It is a blazing, cinematic comic book, full of virtuoso movie-making, terrific momentum, solid performances and a compelling story.This is the film that cemented Schwarzenegger's spot in the action-brawn firmament, and it was well deserved. James Cameron's story and direction are pared to the bone and all the more creepy. But don't overlook the contributions of Linda Hamilton, who more than holds her own as the Terminator's would-be victim, Sarah Connor that helps create a new generation of rugged, clear-thinking female action stars. It's surprising how well this film holds up, and how its minimalist, malevolent violence is actually way scarier than that of its far more expensive, more effects-laden sequel.Added to that,with its impressive action sequences, taut economic direction, and relentlessly fast pace, it's clear why it continues to be an influence on sci-fi and action flicks.",10,1,1,21 October 2012
Hotel Rwanda," The Accidental Hero At Rwanda
","Hotel Rwanda is a that was based on real life events in Rwanda during the spring of 1994.The film stars Don Cheadle as hotelier Paul Rusesabagina, who attempts to rescue his fellow citizens from the ravages of the Rwandan Genocide. Actors Sophie Okonedo, Joaquin Phoenix, Nick Nolte and Jean Reno also appear in principal roles. The film documents Rusesabagina's acts to save the lives of his family and more than a thousand other refugees, by granting them shelter in the besieged Hôtel des Mille Collines. Also,it explores genocide, political corruption, and the repercussions of violence.The movie was directed by Terry George,who co-wrote the script with Keir Pearson.Paul Rusesabagina is the hotel manager at the fancy Les Milles Collines hotel in Kigali. He is a Hutu, and a very successful businessman who smoothly greases the wheels, making powerful connections in all strata of Rwandan life. His wife, Tatiana is a Tutsi. She urges Paul to use his influence to help local Tutsis, who are being harassed and beaten with increasing frequency, but Paul will only use the political capital he's built up to help his own family, if and when they need it. Soon enough, the violence escalates, and the Hutus begin their genocide of the Tutsis. European guests and staff at the hotel are flown out of the country, and Paul is left in charge. He finds that his conscience won't allow him to watch as the innocent are slaughtered, and before long, the hotel has become a well-appointed refugee camp. Paul is seen as a traitor by some, putting his life in danger, and the predicament of his 'guests' grows more precarious every day, but despite good intentions on the part of a journalist and a UN peacekeeping colonel, the rest of the world is not eager to intervene and stop the massacre.This is a sobering and heartfelt tale about massacre that took place in Rwanda while most of the world looked away.The almost forgotten but all too real African genocide documented in Hotel Rwanda hits us as suddenly and as hard as it does Paul Rusesabagina, the accidental hero played so masterfully by Don Cheadle. Obviously,this is a solid film, but it is the truth that holds the power, not the direction.Also,it imparts the message about the cost of doing nothing.",10,1,1,1 October 2012
We Were Soldiers," A Movie About Soldiers
","We Were Soldiers is a war film that dramatizes the Battle of Ia Drang on November 14, 1965. It is based on the book,'We Were Soldiers Once And Young' by Retired Lieutenant General Hal Moore and reporter Joseph L. Galloway, both of whom were at the battle.The movie stars Mel Gibson together with Madeleine Stowe,Taylor Momsen,Luke Benward,Devon Werkheiser,Sam Elliott,Greg Kinnear,Chris Klein,Keri Russell and Barry Pepper.It was written and directed by Randall Wallace. Lt. Col. Hal Moore is the commander of the First Battalion, Seventh Cavalry and the same regiment fatefully led by George Armstrong Custer. As part of the Pleiku Campaign of late 1965, Moore is assigned to an action at Landing Zone X-Ray in the Drang Valley, an area that would come to be known as the 'The Valley of Death.' He soon finds himself and his men contained to an area about the size of a football field, surrounded by more than 2,000 enemy troops and engaged in the first major battle of the war. Heroism becomes the order of the day as men like Moore, chopper pilot Bruce Crandall, and Lt. Henry Herrick refuse to yield, in spite of heavy losses of life. We Were Soldiers is a fitting tribute to all the men and women who have fought and died for their country and for each other.The war genre does that by taking several steps backward with this old-fashioned moralistic saga and by doing a much better job of establishing the characters before they plunge into battle.Also,despite of the violence it portrays on screen,it has a good story and an important message that it wants to impart to the viewer.",10,2,4,21 September 2012

Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," The Benchmark For Buddy Action-Comedies
","Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a Western film based loosely on fact as the film tells the story of Wild West outlaws Robert LeRoy Parker, known to history as Butch Cassidy and his partner Harry Longabaugh, the 'Sundance Kid' as they migrate to Bolivia while on the run from the law in search of a more successful criminal career.It stars Paul Newman and Robert Redford as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid respectively,together with Katharine Ross.It was written by William Goldman and directed by George Roy Hill.Witty pals Butch and Sundance join the Gang in successfully robbing yet another train with their trademark non-lethal style. After the pair rests at the home of Sundance's schoolmarm girlfriend, Etta, the Gang robs the same train, but this time, the railroad boss has hired the best trackers in the business to foil the crime. After being tailed over rocks and a river gorge by guys that they can barely identify save for a white hat, they decide that maybe it's time to try their luck in Bolivia. Taking Etta with them, they live high on ill-gotten Bolivian gains, but she leaves after their white-hatted nemesis portentously arrives. Their luck running out,they are soon holed up in a barn surrounded by scores of Bolivian soldiers who are waiting for the pair to make one last run for it.The film has gone down as among the defining moments in American cinema due to the iconic pairing of Paul Newman and Robert Redford, jaunty screenplay, Burt Bacharach score and the entertainment it gives the viewer.Aside from that,it has set the benchmark for buddy action- comedies for many years to come and the charm that both lead stars - Newman and Redford - deliver in their roles has become the standard in terms of performance.Watching this is a great experience and anyone who appreciates great film will truly understand that.",10,1,2,23 September 2012
Ocean's Twelve," Poor And Lazy Sequel
","After pulling off the heist of their lives, Danny Ocean and his pals unexpectedly find themselves back in harness in this sequel to 2001's blockbuster hit Ocean's Eleven in this movie entitled,Ocean's Twelve. It is a crime comedy film, the sequel to 2001's Ocean's Eleven. Like its predecessor,the film used a celebrity ensemble cast that features George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Andy García, Julia Roberts, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac,Julia Roberts,Casey Affleck,Scott Caan, Vincent Cassel,Eddie Jemison,Shaobo Qin,Carl Reiner and Elliott Gould.It was written by George Nolfi and directed by Steven Soderbergh.After robbing a cool $160 million from the Bellaggio Hotel Casino and winning back his former wife, Tess, from Bellagio owner Terry Benedict, Danny Ocean is living quietly on the lam in Connecticut when he's unexpectedly approached by Benedict. It seems Benedict has tracked down Danny and the ten men who helped him pull off the seemingly impossible robbery, and Benedict offers them a proposal -- if they can repay the $160 million in two weeks, he won't have them killed. As it turns out, both Danny and his best friend, Rusty Ryan, haven't been doing so well in terms of money management and could use some cash, so they set out to plan a robbery to recover the loot, with the same crew helping out -- Linus Caldwell, Frank Catton, Basher Tarr, Saul Bloom, Reuben Tishkoff, Livingston Dell, Yen, Virgil Malloy, and his brother Turk. Danny and Rusty discover that an incredibly rare Fabergé egg is being displayed at a museum in Rome which would fetch the price they need, but they soon discover a notorious cat burglar, François Toulour, is also after the egg, and it turns into a race to see who can claim it first. Adding to the intrigue is Isabel Lahiri, a woman Rusty used to be involved with who is now a top agent with Interpol and is after both Toulour and Ocean's crew.Shot on location in both the United States and Europe,it had excellent production design and visuals. But the positives end there.The latest star-studded heist flick is lazy, self-satisfied and illogical.It has a thin plot and tries to capitalize basically on the success of the previous movie,Ocean's Eleven. Even with the addition of Catherine Zeta- Jones makes no difference in the movie.While it has its hysterical moments,it basically falls flat as a poor sequel and an interesting heist film.",7,1,4,1 January 2012
Crash," A Morality Tale
","Crash is a drama co-written, produced, and directed by Paul Haggis. The film is about racial and social tensions in Los Angeles, California wherein several characters' stories interweave.The ensemble cast includes Sandra Bullock,Don Cheadle,Matt Dillon,Jennifer Esposito,Brendan Fraser,Terrence Howard,Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges,Thandie Newton,Ryan Phillippe,Larenz Tate and Michael Peña It was inspired by a real life incident in which his Porsche was carjacked outside a video store on Wilshire Boulevard back in 1991.Graham is a police detective whose brother is a street criminal, and it hurts him to know his mother cares more about his never-do-well brother than him. Graham's partner is Ria, who is also his girlfriend, though she has begun to bristle at his emotional distance, as well as his occasional insensitivity over the fact he's African-American and she's Hispanic. Rick is an L.A. district attorney whose wife, Jean, makes little secret of her fear and hatred of people unlike herself. Jean's worst imaginings about people of color are confirmed when her SUV is carjacked by two African-American men in Anthony, who dislikes white people as much as Jean hates blacks, and Peter, who is more open minded. Cameron is a well-to-do African-American television producer with a beautiful wife, Christine. While coming home from a party, Cameron and Christine are pulled over by Officer Ryan, who subjects them to a humiliating interrogation while his new partner, Officer Hansen (Ryan Phillippe), looks on. Daniel is a hard-working locksmith and dedicated father who discovers that his looks don't lead many of his customers to trust him. And Farhad is a Middle Eastern shopkeeper who is so constantly threatened in the wake of the 9/11 attacks that he decided he needs a gun to defend his family. Movie studios, by and large, avoid controversial subjects like race the way you might avoid a hive of angry bees. So it's remarkable that Crash even got made; that it's a rich, intelligent, and moving exploration of the interlocking lives of a dozen Los Angeles residents--black, white, Latino, Asian, and Persian--is downright amazing.This is the rare American film really about something, and almost all the performances are riveting. It asks tough questions, and lets its audience struggle with the answers.",10,1,4,28 September 2012
Snatch," Snatch: Excellent Movie
","Guy Ritchie's sophomore follow-up to his 1998 sleeper hit Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch revisits the previous film's territory of London's crime-ridden underbelly, and does so with the same brand of humor and stylish direction that made his first effort a surprise success.A crime film written and directed by British filmmaker,Snatch features an ensemble cast namely: Jason Statham,Stephen Graham,Alan Ford,Dennis Farina,Brad Pitt,Vinnie Jones,Robbie Gee,Lennie James,Ade,Rade erbedija and Benicio del Toro.Set in the London criminal underworld, it contains two intertwined plots: one dealing with the search for a stolen diamond, the other with a small-time boxing promoter named Turkish who finds himself under the thumb of a ruthless gangster known as Brick Top.Also,it it features an assortment of colourful characters, including gypsy Mickey O'Neil, arms-dealer Boris 'the Blade' Yurinov, professional thief and gambling addict Frankie 'Four-Fingers', American gangster-jeweler 'Cousin Avi', and bounty hunter Bullet-Tooth Tony. With a labyrinthine plot that is ostensibly oriented around a missing diamond, Snatch introduces viewers to three groups of characters intent on retrieving the elusive stone, which has been stolen from an Antwerp jeweler. In the first group are friends and business partners Turkish and Tommy, who join up with Mickey, an Irish gypsy and boxer. Turkish and Tommy make arrangements with Mickey to take a fall in a match engineered by lunatic gang leader Brick Top. In another corner resides equally loony Russian gangster Boris the Blade, who has asked Jewish gangster Franky Four Fingers to place a bet on the match for him. Boris is also scheming to have Sol, the owner of a pawn shop, rob the place with a couple of dim associates. Meanwhile, Avi, freshly arrived in London from New York, hires Bullet Tooth Tony to find Franky when he goes missing; it seems that it was none other than Franky who was supposed to be transporting the purloined diamond to New York.It is distinguished by a kinetic direction and editing style, a circular plot featuring numerous ironic twists of chance and causality, and a fast pace.Through this style,Rictchie makes the film totally satisfying and entertaining. Also,it holds the audience interest from beginning to end. This also make the film original which makes it not formulaic and predictable.The movie is also characterized by brilliant performances as they enhance their interesting characters through their great portrayal.As a result,Snatch is a must-see for it is one excellent movie.",10,1,3,30 December 2011
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," A Timeless Cold War Movie
","Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, commonly known as Dr. Strangelove, is a black comedy film which satirizes the nuclear scare. It was directed, produced, and co-written by Stanley Kubrick, starring Peter Sellers and George C. Scott, and featuring Sterling Hayden, Keenan Wynn, and Slim Pickens. The film is loosely based on Peter George's Cold War thriller novel Red Alert, also known as Two Hours to Doom.The story concerns an unhinged United States Air Force general who orders a first strike nuclear attack on the Soviet Union. It follows the President of the United States, his advisers, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and a Royal Air Force (RAF) officer as they try to recall the bombers to prevent a nuclear apocalypse. It separately follows the crew of one B-52 as they try to deliver their payload.In 1964, with the Cuban Missile Crisis fresh in viewers' minds, the Cold War at its frostiest, and the hydrogen bomb relatively new and frightening, Stanley Kubrick dared to make a film about what could happen if the wrong person pushed the wrong button -- and played the situation for laughs. Loaded with thermonuclear weapons, a U.S. bomber piloted by Maj. T.J. 'King' Kong is on a routine flight pattern near the Soviet Union when they receive orders to commence Wing Attack Plan R, best summarized by Maj. Kong as 'Nuclear combat! Toe to toe with the Russkies!' On the ground at Burpleson Air Force Base, Group Capt. Lionel Mandrake notices nothing on the news about America being at war. Gen. Jack D. Ripper calmly informs him that he gave the command to attack the Soviet Union because it was high time someone did something about fluoridation, which is sapping Americans' bodily fluids (and apparently has something to do with Ripper's sexual dysfunction). Meanwhile, President Merkin Muffley meets with his top Pentagon advisers, including super-hawk Gen. Buck Turgidson, who sees this as an opportunity to do something about Communism in general and Russians in particular. However, the ante is upped considerably when Soviet ambassador de Sadesky (Peter Bull) informs Muffley and his staff of the latest innovation in Soviet weapons technology: a 'Doomsday Machine' that will destroy the entire world if the Russians are attacked.Dr. Strangelove's jet-black satire and a host of superb comic performances have kept the film fresh and entertaining, even as its issues have become less timely.This landmark movie's madcap humor and terrifying suspense remain undiminished by time.Stanley Kubrick's brilliant Cold War satire remains as funny and razor-sharp today as it was in 1964 - its year of release.",10,2,4,27 February 2012
The Bodyguard," A Melodramatic Love Story
","The Bodyguard is a romantic thriller film starring Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston. Costner stars as a former Secret Service Agent-turned- bodyguard who is hired to protect Houston's character, a music star, from an unknown stalker. Lawrence Kasdan wrote the film in the 1970's, originally as a vehicle for Steve McQueen and Diana Ross.It was directed by Mick Jackson. When imperious musical superstar Rachel Marron begins receiving death threats, she is compelled to hire a bodyguard. An ex-Secret Service agent, Frank still hasn't purged himself of his guilt feelings over his inability to protect from an assassination of the President of the United States.He is now a highly successful private and professional bodyguard who protects corporate VIPs. He is hired by Rachel's manager, Bill Devaney to protect her after she receives a number of threats against her life and a small bomb detonates in her dressing room.Gradually,Rachel and Frank fall in love. This 1992 crowd pleaser made almost as much money for Whitney Houston as its chart-busting soundtrack. A high-wattage star vehicle as only Hollywood can make as she is baring her tonsils with a rousing rendition of the Dolly Parton chestnut 'I Will Always Love You'.Overall,it is a cheesy, melodramatic potboiler with occasional moments of electricity.But nevertheless,it does contain a love story, but it's the kind of guarded passion that grows between two people who spend a lot of time keeping their priorities straight.",8,1,4,18 October 2012
The Beach," Leo's First Post-Titanic Film
","For his first major project after the overwhelming success of Titanic, Leonardo Di Caprio took a risky path in this adaptation of Alex Garland's acclaimed novel and film directed by Danny Boyle in the movie called,The Beach.The film stars DiCaprio together with Tilda Swinton, Robert Carlyle, Virginie Ledoyen and Guillaume Canet. It was filmed on the Thai island Koh Phi Phi.Richard is an American backpacking through Asia with a handful of friends from Europe. While in Bangkok, he meets a mad Scotsman who calls himself Daffy Duck. Shortly before Mr. Duck kills himself, he gives Richard a crude map to a place in Thailand that he claims is paradise on earth: beautiful, unspoiled, and uninhabited. For lack of anything better to do, Richard and his companions try to locate the spot, which, after a dangerous and taxing journey, takes them to a beach as beautiful as Duck said it would be. Richard and his friends settle in, but before long they discover that they are not alone; a large group of fellow travelers has already dug themselves in, and they have established a community with the same social evils that Richard was hoping to leave behind. Just as important, there is an army of natives who grow marijuana in the nearby hills and do not appreciate the presence of these visitors.The Beach is unfocused and muddled.It was also a shallow adaptation of the novel it is based on. Only the gorgeous cinematography provides it great view. It simply gained commercial success due Leonardo Di Caprio's presence in his first post-Titanic film in a starring role.",8,1,2,9 January 2012
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Return of the Jedi: Fitting End To A Classic Star Wars Series
","The film is set approximately one year after Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back.Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi is an epic space opera film directed by Richard Marquand and written by George Lucas and Lawrence Kasdan. It is the third film released in the Star Wars saga, and the sixth in terms of the series' internal chronology.In the final episode of the Star Wars saga,Han Solo emerges intact from the carbonated casing in which he'd been sealed in The Empire Strikes Back. The bad news is that Solo, together with Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia, is prisoner to the grotesque Jabba the Hutt. But with the help of the charismatic Lando Calrissian, our heroes and our heroine manage to escape.The evil Galactic Empire, with the help of the villainous Darth Vader, is building a second Death Star in order to crush the Rebel Alliance. Since Emperor Palpatine plans to personally oversee the final stages of its construction, the Rebel Fleet launches a full-scale attack on the Death Star in order to prevent its completion and kill Palpatine, effectively bringing an end to the Empire. The next task is to rid the galaxy of Darth Vader and the Emperor,now in command of a new, under-construction Death Star. On the forest moon Endor, the good guys enlist the help of a feisty bunch of bear-like creatures called the Ewoks in their battle against the Empire.Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker, a Rebel leader and Jedi Knight, struggles to bring Vader, who is his father and himself a fallen Jedi, back from the Dark Side of the Force.This installment is considered by many to be the best of the first three Star Wars in terms of technical accomplishment and narrative involvement but it is the most Disney-esque in its emotional outline, yet that outline is buried beneath an obnoxiously hyped-up pace that reduces the emotions to rubble.It is not as exciting as Star Wars itself, which had the advantage of novelty. But it is better and more satisfying than The Empire Strikes Back only in terms of entertainment.But nevertheless,The acting in Return of the Jedi is stronger than in the previous films and it still had its moments. Though failing to reach the cinematic heights of its predecessors, Return of the Jedi remains an great sci-fi adventure and a fitting end to the classic trilogy.",10,1,4,14 January 2012

A shadowy 'Mr Church' approach them to overthrow the tyrannical South American dictator General Gaza and restore order to the troubled island country of Vilena.It isn't long before it was known the real target happens to be a former CIA officer,James Monroe.This makes the mission substantially more difficult than expected.The film was advertised as a throwback to action movies of the 80's and 90's.The actions scenes were definitely huge and excessively violent.No question that action film lovers will definitely enjoy and will be enormously entertained watching this movie.Too bad that despite the talent involved,the film came out to be just ordinary for there is nothing really new or groundbreaking.Besides,the only achievement it managed to get is to have great action stars get assembled in one big film.",8,1,1,26 December 2014
Pan's Labyrinth," Alice in Wonderland For Grown-ups
","Pan's Labyrinth is a Mexican Spanish-language dark-fantasy film,written and directed by Mexican film-maker Guillermo del Toro. It was produced and distributed by the Mexican film company Esperanto Films. Pan's Labyrinth takes place in Spain in May–June 1944, five years after the Spanish Civil War, during the early Francoist period. The narrative of the film interweaves this real world with a fantasy world centered around an overgrown abandoned labyrinth and a mysterious faun creature, with which the main character, Ofelia, interacts. Ofelia's stepfather, the Falangist Captain Vidal, hunts the Spanish Maquis who fight against the Fascist reign in the region, while Ofelia's pregnant mother grows increasingly ill. Ofelia meets several strange and magical creatures who become central to her story, leading her through the trials of the old labyrinth garden. Pan's Labyrinth suggests that fairy-tale violence helps the vulnerable process and overcome real-life conflicts and that real-life violence permanently smashes the soul and the heart.This magical film from Guillermo del Toro manages that intellectual high-mindedness, even as it resonates on a primal, mythic level.It is Alice in Wonderland for grown- ups, with the horrors of both reality and fantasy blended together into an extraordinary, spellbinding fable. Told through the eyes of a little girl whose imaginary world is inhabited by nightmarish creatures,it also is a visually imaginative and allegorical take on the fears she faced in Spain during World War II.",10,2,5,7 March 2012
Knocked Up," A Comedy Cult Classic
","Knocked Up is a romantic comedy drama film that stars Seth Rogen, Katherine Heigl, Paul Rudd, and Leslie Mann.It follows the repercussions of a drunken one-night stand between a slacker character and a just- promoted media personality that results in an unintended pregnancy.It was co-produced, written, and directed by Judd Apatow.When a one-night stand that should have stayed that way has unexpected consequences, the reluctant odd couple attempts to transform their tentative relationship into a lasting love in this conception comedy. Twenty-four-year-old entertainment journalist Alison Scott (Heigl) is on the fast track to the big time, but an alcohol-fueled hookup with responsibility-shirking slacker Ben Stone (Rogen) finds her professional priorities taking a back seat to having a baby. Now, as overgrown kid Ben attempts to assume the responsibilities of fatherhood, he makes the brave decision to stand by Alison. In order to make things work between the pair, however, there's going to have to be some compromise, and when Alison and Ben decide to take a shot at love, they quickly find that building a relationship from scratch isn't nearly as easy as making a baby.It is one of the best comedy I have ever seen just like The 40 Year Old Virgin,who also was directed by the film's director Judd Apatow for it was funny,goofy,smart and dirty.Aside from the laughs,it also explores the world of relationships with the next logical step -- pregnancy and how people change with this development.Also,the performances of the cast also makes the movie works as Heigl and Rogen presents character - Allison and Ben - as likable people that a viewer would really care for them with respect to what they are undergoing and what's in store for them in the future with a baby coming.This is a highly recommended film especially for people in relationship and pregnant women.",10,1,5,14 September 2012
Alien," In Space, No One Can Hear You Scream
","Alien is a science fiction horror film directed by Ridley Scott and starring Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, Ian Holm and Yaphet Kotto. The film's title refers to its primary antagonist: a highly aggressive extraterrestrial creature that stalks and kills the crew of a spaceship. Dan O'Bannon wrote the screenplay from a story by him and Ronald Shusett, drawing influence from previous works of science fiction and horror. The film was produced through Brandywine Productions and distributed by 20th Century Fox, with producers David Giler and Walter Hill making significant revisions and additions to the script. The titular Alien and its accompanying elements were designed by Swiss surrealist artist H. R. Giger, while concept artists Ron Cobb and Chris Foss designed the human aspects of the film.A close encounter of the third kind becomes a Jaws-style nightmare when an alien invades a spacecraft in Ridley Scott's sci-fi horror classic. On the way home from a mission for the Company, the Nostromo's crew is woken up from hibernation by the ship's Mother computer to answer a distress signal from a nearby planet. Capt. Dallas's rescue team discovers a bizarre pod field, but things get even stranger when a face- hugging creature bursts out of a pod and attaches itself to Kane. Over the objections of Ripley, science officer Ash lets Kane back on the ship. The acid-blooded incubus detaches itself from an apparently recovered Kane, but an alien erupts from Kane's stomach and escapes. The alien starts stalking the humans, pitting Dallas and his crew as well as the cat against a malevolent killing machine that also has a protector in the nefarious Company. The movie remains a benchmark of extra-terrestrial horror, and gave us a bona fide A-list star in the shape of Sigourney Weaver.Also,it is nothing short of a masterpiece. Technically brilliant, tense, horrifying and visually breathtaking, there's not a moment in this B-monster movie that doesn't excel well beyond the usual genre trappings.Aside from that,it proved that material derided as B-movie fodder could be handled with finesse and glossy production values, without diminishing the thrills or polishing over the hard-edged horror.Although there's nothing terribly complex or original about the movie, but it is distinguished by its clever and innovative use of B-movie staples in a hi-tech setting.In summary,it is a landmark of sci-fi horror cinema excellence.",10,3,6,28 February 2012
The Polar Express," Great Technical Achievement But Characters Aren't Life-like
","The Polar Express is a motion capture computer-animated film based on the children's book of the same title by Chris Van Allsburg. It was written, produced, and directed by Robert Zemeckis. The film stars Daryl Sabara, Nona Gaye, Jimmy Bennett, and Eddie Deezen, with Tom Hanks in six distinct roles.The human characters in the film were animated using live action performance capture technique, with the exception of the waiters who dispense hot chocolate on the train, because their feats were impossible for live actors to achieve. Performance capture technology incorporates the movements of live actors into animated characters. The Polar Express revolves around Billy, who longs to believe in Santa Claus but finds it quite difficult to do so, what with his family's dogged insistence that all of it, from the North Pole, to the elves, to the man himself, is all just a myth. This all changes, however, on Christmas Eve, when a mysterious train visits Billy in the middle of the night, promising to take him and a group of other lucky children to the North Pole for a visit with Santa. The train's conductor along with the other passengers help turn Billy's crisis in faith into a journey of self-discovery.The Polar Express is obviously visually stunning overall but the animation for the human characters isn't lifelike enough and the story is not engaging from at all.The viewer may find it not to care with the characters at all as the movie lacks energy and vitality.Overall,The Polar Express is a great technical achievement in cinema but the story as well as the characters are empty and far from absorbing.",8,1,3,10 November 2011
Malcolm X," Malcolm X:One Of The Best Biopics Ever Released
","Malcolm X is a biographical film about the African-American figure Malcolm X,who is also known as Malcolm Little,was co-written, co- produced, and directed by Spike Lee. It stars Denzel Washington in the title role together with Angela Bassett, Albert Hall, Al Freeman, Jr., and Delroy Lindo. Black Panther Party co-founder Bobby Seale, the Rev. Al Sharpton, and future South Africa president Nelson Mandela have cameo appearances.Malcolm X's screenplay, co-credited to Lee and Arnold Perl, is based largely on Alex Haley's 1965 book, The Autobiography of Malcolm X. Haley collaborated with Malcolm X on the book beginning in 1963 and completed it after Malcolm X's death.The film dramatizes key events in Malcolm X's life: his criminal career, his incarceration, his conversion to Islam, his ministry as a member of the Nation of Islam and his later falling out with the organization, his marriage to Betty X, his pilgrimage to Mecca and reevaluation of his views concerning whites, and his assassination on February 21, 1965. Defining childhood incidents, including his father's death, his mother's mental illness, and his experiences with racism are dramatized in flashbacks.Spike Lee called Malcolm X 'the picture I was born to make,' and star Denzel Washington referred to the titular civil-rights leader as 'the role of a lifetime.' They're both right.Visually and dramatically, Lee pulls out all the stops, but it's Washington's performance that really energizes the film, and he's an exhilarating presence throughout.Added to that,a viewer would realize that it is an ambitious, tough, seriously considered biographical film that, with honor, eludes easy characterization.Overall,anchored by a powerful performance from Denzel Washington, Spike Lee's biopic of the legendary civil rights leader brings his autobiography to life with an epic sweep and a nuanced message.One of the best biopics ever released on screen.",10,6,13,24 October 2012

The Town," The Town Is A Must-See
","The Town is a crime drama starring, co-written(together with Peter Craig and Aaron Stockard), and directed by Ben Affleck.Jon Hamm,Rebecca Hall,Blake Lively,Jeremy Renner,Pete Postlethwaite and Chris Cooper play key supporting roles.The film was adapted from Chuck Hogan's novel Prince of Thieves and it was one of a number set in Boston, Massachusetts over the past decade that have formed a 'sub-genre' of crime films like The Departed and Gone Baby Gone.Boston bank robber Doug MacRay falls for a woman his gang had previously taken hostage after feigning a chance meeting with her to ensure that she can't identify them. The son of a tough Charlestown, MA thief, Doug passed on his chance to walk the straight and narrow in favor of becoming a career bank robber. Not only is Doug's crew one of the most ruthless in Boston, but they're also one of the best; they never leave a trace of evidence, and always make a clean break. Over the years, Doug's fearless partners in crime have become something of a surrogate family to him. Jem,who is the most dangerous of the bunch is the closest thing Doug has ever had to a brother. But a divide begins to open between the two career criminals when Jem takes bank manager Claire Keesey hostage during a particularly tense heist, and the group subsequently discovers that she hails from their own tight-knit suburb. When Jem proposes that the gang make an effort to find out just how much Claire recalls about the crime, Doug fears that his volatile partner may do more harm than good and volunteers himself for the job. Later, Doug turns on the charm while pretending to bump into Claire by chance, and becomes convinced that she doesn't suspect him of being the same man who just robbed her bank. As the feds turn up the heat on the gang, Doug finds himself falling for Claire, and searching desperately for a means of cutting his ties to his criminal past. But with each passing day, Jem grows increasingly suspicious of Doug's true motivations. Now caught between two worlds with no chance of turning back, Doug realizes that his only hope for finding a happy future is to betray the only family he's ever known.This is a solid crime drama.No question about it.It is tense, smartly written, and wonderfully cast.It may not be original in any sense of the word as it is a deliberately old-fashioned melodrama that echoes the pulpy mix of violence and romanticism of gangster films.But the director,Ben Affleck does a marvelous job executing all of the pieces and is easily one of the best films during its year of release.Also,it happens to be one of the most entertaining films ever released.Watch it and see it for your self.Definitely,it is highly recommended.",10,3,5,29 September 2012

It's only until you're more than halfway through the movie that you'll have to ask yourself exactly why you are watching such a beautifully tragic tale, as it is basically the ickiest, grossest, most dysfunctional parts of all your past relationships strung together into one movie. Ultimately, it falls to the four actors to draw you deeper into the story; all succeed relatively, but it's Law and Owen whose characters will cut you to the quick. Law proves that yet again he's most adept at playing charming, amoral bastards with manipulative streaks, and Owen is nothing short of brilliant as the character most turned on by the energy inherent in destructive relationships.",9,1,2,28 September 2012
Taxi Driver," Truly A Must-See Classic
","Taxi Driver is a 1976 American psychological thriller film directed by Martin Scorsese and written by Paul Schrader. The film is set in New York City, soon after the Vietnam War. The film stars Robert De Niro and features Jodie Foster, Harvey Keitel, and Cybill Shepherd. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture.In Martin Scorsese's classic 1970s drama, insomniac ex-Marine Travis Bickle works the nightshift, driving his cab throughout decaying mid- '70s New York City, wishing for a 'real rain' to wash the 'scum' off the neon-lit streets. Chronically alone, Travis cannot connect with anyone, not even with such other cabbies as blowhard Wizard. He becomes infatuated with vapid blonde presidential campaign worker Betsy, who agrees to a date and then spurns Travis when he cluelessly takes her to a porno movie. After an encounter with a malevolent fare (played by Scorsese), the increasingly paranoid Travis begins to condition (and arm) himself for his imagined destiny, a mission that mutates from assassinating Betsy's candidate, Charles Palatine, to violently 'saving' teen hooker Iris from her pimp, Sport. Travis' bloodbath turns him into a media hero; but has it truly calmed his mind? Written by Paul Schrader, Taxi Driver is an homage to and reworking of cinematic influences, a study of individual psychosis, and an acute diagnosis of the latently violent, media-fixated Vietnam era. Scorsese and Schrader structure Travis' mission to save Iris as a film noir version of John Ford's late Western The Searchers (1956), aligning Travis with a mythology of American heroism while exposing that myth's obsessively violent underpinnings. Yet Travis' military record and assassination attempt, as well as Palatine's political platitudes, also ground Taxi Driver in its historical moment of American in the 1970s. Employing such techniques as Godardian jump cuts and ellipses, expressive camera moves and angles, and garish colors, all punctuated by Bernard Herrmann's eerie final score (finished the day he died), Scorsese presents a Manhattan skewed through Travis' point-of-view, where De Niro's now-famous 'You talking' to me' improv becomes one more sign of Travis' madness. Shot during a New York summer heat wave and garbage strike, Taxi Driver got into trouble with the MPAA for its violence. Scorsese desaturated the color in the final shoot-out and got an R, and Taxi Driver surprised its unenthusiastic studio by becoming a box-office hit. Released in the Bicentennial year, after Vietnam, Watergate, and attention-getting attempts on President Ford's life, Taxi Driver's intense portrait of a man and a society unhinged spoke resonantly to the mid-'70s audience -- too resonantly in the case of attempted Reagan assassin and Foster fan John W. Hinckley. Taxi Driver went on to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, but it lost the Best Picture Oscar to the more comforting Rocky. Anchored by De Niro's disturbing embodiment of 'God's lonely man,' Taxi Driver remains a striking milestone of both Scorsese's career and 1970s Hollywood. In summary,Taxi Driver must-see film for movie lovers, this Martin Scorsese masterpiece is as hard-hitting as it is compelling, with Robert De Niro at his best.",10,4,7,25 February 2012
Shutter Island," Shutter Island Makes Many Surprising Twists And Turns
","Shutter Island is a best-selling novel by Dennis Lehane.A film adaptation was made by director Martin Scorsese that stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Teddy Daniels, Mark Ruffalo as Chuck Aule, Ben Kingsley as Dr. Cawley, and Max von Sydow as Dr. Naehringwas.The film opens in 1954 as World War II veteran and current federal marshal Teddy Daniels and his new partner, Chuck, ferry to Shutter Island, a water-bound mental hospital housing the criminally insane. They have been asked to investigate the disappearance of Rachel Solando ,a patient admitted to the asylum after she murdered her three children. As Teddy quizzes Dr. Cawley, the head of the institution, he begins to suspect that the authorities in charge might not be giving him the whole truth, and that a terrible fate may befall all the patients in the spooky Ward C -- a unit devoted to the most heinous of the hospital's inmates. Complicating matters further, Teddy has a secret of his own -- the arsonist who murdered his wife is incarcerated on Shutter Island. Driven to confront his wife's killer, and stranded on the island because of a hurricane, Teddy must unravel the secrets of the eerie place before succumbing to his own madness.The movie is a brilliant and intelligent one.It keeps the viewer guessing to the end and then it miraculously makes the guessing somewhat pay off.It tries to make a fool out of you but in the end it should be categorized as a flashy thriller and a smart one as well that maybe far comparable from any magic trick about what is real or what is delusion and what is monstrous or what is decent.Overall,it is one engaging and highly entertaining movie.",10,1,2,29 October 2011
Capote," Capote Is A Must-See
","Capote is a biographical film about Truman Capote, following the events during the writing of Capote's non-fiction book In Cold Blood.It stars Philip Seymour Hoffman in the title role together with Catherine Keener, Clifton Collins Jr.,Bruce Greenwood,Mark Pellegrino,Amy Ryan and Chris Cooper.It was based on Gerald Clarke's biography Capote.In 1959, Truman Capote was a critically acclaimed novelist who had earned a small degree of celebrity for his work when he read a short newspaper item about a multiple murder in a small Kansas town. For some reason, the story fascinated Capote, and he asked William Shawn, his editor at The New Yorker, to let him write a piece about the case. Capote had long believed that in the right hands, a true story could be molded into a tale as compelling as any fiction, and he believed this event, in which the brutal and unimaginable was visited upon a community where it was least expected, could be just the right material. Capote traveled to Kansas with his close friend Harper Lee, herself becoming a major literary figure with the success of To Kill a Mockingbird, and while Capote's effete and mannered personal style stuck out like a sore thumb in Kansas, in time he gained the trust of Alvin Dewey, the Kansas Bureau of Investigation agent investigating the murder of the Clutter family, and with his help Capote's magazine piece grew into a full- length book. Capote also became familiar with the petty criminals who killed the Clutter family, Dick Hickock and Perry Smith, and in Smith he found a troubling kindred spirit more like himself than he wanted to admit. After attaining a sort of friendship with Smith under the assumption that the man would be executed before the book was ever published, Capote finds himself forced to directly confront the moral implications of his actions with regards to both his role in the man's death, and the way that he would be remembered.The almost perfectly realized Capote -- stumbling only in the lack of shading it gives Keener's and Greenwood's characters -- offers a sobering glimpse at what the author had to give up of his soul to achieve his success.Philip Seymour Hoffman's riveting central performance guides a well-constructed retelling of the most sensational and significant period in author Truman Capote's life.This is definitely a must-see movie.",10,2,2,12 October 2012
Life of Pi," Better On The Technical Level Than Storytelling Just Like Avatar
","Life of Pi is a 3D adventure drama film adaptation of Yann Martel's novel of the same title that revolves around an Indian man named Piscine Molitor 'Pi' Patel.It was directed by Ang Lee and it features cast that includes Suraj Sharma, Irrfan Khan, Rafe Spall, Gérard Depardieu, Tabu, and Adil Hussain.Pi happens to be a novelist who lives in Canada.He tells the story of how he survived a shipwreck at age 16 wherein his family dies and his experience of being stranded in lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific Ocean together with a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.This leads his to adventure and a journey to self-discovery. Just like Avatar,this movie is critical and commercial success.And just like the said movie,it is also better on the technical level rather than the storytelling as the 3D special effects unfortunately somehow supersedes the emotional and insightful story of Pi.Too bad that the magnificent visual splendor of the film could take away the viewers attention to what the main character - Pi - is all about especially in times of the most difficult moments of his life particularly in his struggle to survive and overcome the most painful ones when his family dies.Nevertheless,one cannot deny that this remains a great film as it is a visual masterpiece from Ang Lee despite of the reasons mentioned above.",10,1,4,8 November 2014
Over the Top," The Signature Film For Arm Wrestling
","Over The Top is a sports drama about arm-wrestling that features Sylvester Stallone together with Robert Loggia,Susan Blakely and David Mendenhall.Late Israeli director Menahem Golan directed it.Lincoln Hawk is a truck driver who left his estranged wife and son ten years ago.His ex-wife Christina is very ill and has requested him to visit his son Michael from school so that two of them can form a relationship.Unfortunately,his controlling grandfather Jason Cutler,a wealthy businessman, is hates his him and disapproves of it.In the end,Hawk joins an arm wrestling competition to win in order to earn the respect of his son and try to rebuild his life from the earnings he would receive.Just like many other films that Stallone has starred on,this is another action film that presents him to be the underdog.No doubt that he got used to this after achieving stardom from the boxing classic Rocky.While it offers really nothing new and refreshing as it is a clichéd ridden film,the sport of arm wrestling makes it somehow new and refreshing.The arm wrestling scenes definitely were the best moments of the film that provided the viewers a lot of tension,excitement and entertainment.Probably many arm wrestlers would say,'There must be one film about arm wrestling!!!' and for that reason alone Over The Top delivers.That is why this is definitely the signature film for the sport.",8,1,2,24 October 2014
Ocean's Thirteen," Better Than Ocean's Twelve But Not As Good As Ocean's Eleven
","Al Pacino joins a powerhouse cast headed by of George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, and series newcomer Ellen Barkin for this, the third installment of director Steven Soderbergh's popular series of glitzy crime comedies movie,Ocean's Thirteen. It is the third and final film in the Soderbergh series following the 2004 sequel Ocean's Twelve and the 2001 film Ocean's Eleven, which itself was a remake of the 1960 Rat Pack film Ocean's 11. All of the cast members reprised their roles from the previous installments except for Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones. The only hotelier in Las Vegas who can claim that each and every one of his establishments has earned the Royal Review Board's Five Diamond Award, Willy Bank has made more than his share of enemies during his impressive ascent. While most of Bank's adversaries amount to little more than the occasional nuisance, however, this powerful player is about to find out that picking your enemies in Las Vegas can be a true gamble. In betraying Reuben Tishkoff, Bank has finally crossed the one man who could bring his entire empire crumbling to the ground -- Danny Ocean. Now Reuben is in critical condition, and Ocean is determined to strike back at the man who nearly murdered his mentor. Bank may have taken down one of the original Ocean's Eleven, but his efforts only managed to unite the remaining ten closer than ever before. As the opening of Bank's newest casino draws near, Danny and the crew set into motion a bold plan to humiliate the cocksure casino owner and forever tarnish his spotless reputation. It won't be easy, but if Ocean and his team can get their elaborate plan together in time for the opening of The Bank, they just might be able to deliver some serious Las Vegas justice.Ocean's Thirteen reverts to the formula of the first installment specifically the heist in Last Vegas and the result is another slick and entertaining heist film.Although it may not be as good as Ocean's Eleven it terms of satisfaction,it was definitely a lot better that the lazy Ocean's Twelve.Although the story isn't that interesting as it was predictable,it manages to pull off an entertaining heist film.",8,1,1,1 January 2012
Lost in Translation," One Of The Best Films Ever Made
","Lost in Translation is a film written and directed by Sofia Coppola. Her second feature film, after The Virgin Suicides, it stars Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson. The film revolves around an aging actor named Bob Harris (Murray) and a recent college graduate named Charlotte (Johansson) who develop a rapport after a chance meeting in a Tokyo hotel. The movie explores themes of loneliness, alienation, insomnia, existential ennui and culture shock against the backdrop of a modern Japanese city.Bob Harris is a well-known American actor whose career has gone into a tailspin; needing work, he takes a very large fee to appear in a commercial for Japanese whiskey to be shot in Tokyo. Feeling no small degree of culture shock in Japan, Bob spends most of his non-working hours at his hotel, where he meets Charlotte at the bar. Twentysomething Charlotte is married to John, a successful photographer who is in Tokyo on an assignment, leaving her to while away her time while he works. Beyond their shared bemusement and confusion with the sights and sounds of contemporary Tokyo, Bob and Charlotte share a similar dissatisfaction with their lives; the spark has gone out of Bob's marriage, and he's become disillusioned with his career. Meanwhile, Charlotte is puzzled with how much John has changed in their two years of marriage, while she's been unable to launch a creative career of her own. Bob and Charlotte become fast friends, and as they explore Tokyo, they begin to wonder if their sudden friendship might be growing into something more.A relationship picture with elegant connective tissue; it's brittle and real, focused on the nuances of body language and unspoken desire, while indulging in a cheeky bit of knowing absurdity when the mood strikes.This exhibit Coppola's talent as a director.This picture in itself is so good that it compensated whatever mess she created when she made The Godfather Part III.Anyway,the film effectively balances humor and subtle pathos as it had a moving, melancholy story that is also highlighted by the great showcase of talent for both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.In summary,Lost In Translation is one of the best films ever made.",10,7,11,16 September 2012
Barry Lyndon," Kubrick's Greatest Film
","With ornate imagery reminiscent of paintings from the story's 18th century period, Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of William Makepeace Thackeray's novel depicts the rise and fall of a sensitive rogue in the British aristocracy. Barry Lyndon is a period film starring Ryan O'Neal, Marisa Berenson, Patrick Magee and Hardy Krüger. It was written, produced, and directed by Kubrick. It is based on the novel The Luck of Barry Lyndon by William Makepeace Thackeray which recounts the exploits of a fictional 18th century Irish adventurer.Young Irishman Redmond Barry leaves home to seek his fortune after apparently killing an English officer in a duel. Through a series of mishaps and accidents, Barry winds up fighting with the Prussian army in the Seven Years' War under the command of Capt. Potzdorf; at war's end, Potzdorf enlists Barry to spy on a shady Chevalier. Instead, Barry joins up with the Irish Chevalier to flee Prussia and live as gamblers among Europe's elite. Wishing to climb even higher, Barry soon meets the beautiful Lady Lyndon, marrying her for her fortune after her older titled husband dies. Her son Lord Bullingdon, however, despises the upstart Barry, and, regardless of how his mother may feel, sees to it that the re-named Barry Lyndon will never be able to stake his claim to the entrenched aristocracy.In 1975 the world was at Stanley Kubrick's feet. His films Dr. Strangelove, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and A Clockwork Orange, released in the previous dozen years, had provoked rapture and consternation--not merely in the film community, but in the culture at large. On the basis of that smashing hat trick, Kubrick was almost certainly the most famous film director of his generation, and absolutely the one most likely to rewire the collective mind of the movie audience. And what did this radical, at-least-20-years-ahead-of-his-time filmmaker give the world in 1975? A stately, three-hour costume drama that now stands as one of his greatest and most savagely ironic films, not to mention one of the few period pieces on celluloid so transporting that it seems to predate the invention of cameras.In addition to that,Ryan O'Neal's excellent performance captures the shallow opportunism endemic to the title character who is brought down as much by his own flaws as by the mores of the ordered social structure of 18th-century England.All of Kubrick's features look better now than when they were first released, but Barry Lyndon, which fared poorly at the box office in 1975, remains his most underrated. It may also be his greatest.",10,7,10,24 October 2012
Interstellar," A Tale Of Love And Sacrifice
","Interstellar is a science fiction film that tells the story of space travelers that are in search of a new habitable planet in the outer space.The cast includes Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine. It was written by the Nolan brothers: Jonathan and Christopher,who also the director of the film.The time on Planet Earth is nearly up.Cooper,who happens to be a frustrated farmer as it has fallen victim into famine caused by overpopulation; a blight is killing crops and creating massive dust storms; and the rise of nitrogen that is going to cause asphyxiation that will cause the end of humanity.He also happens to be a former NASA Engineer and trained test pilot that lives with his children,Murp and Tom, together with his father-in-law,Donald.One night,Cooper and Murph reach into a secret underground location that was left by NASA wherein a project headed by Professor Brand that intends to find a habitable planet before the clock on earth runs out.Cooper is found to be qualified in this space exploration wherein the destination happens to be a wormhole near Saturn. He later learns that the wormhole happens to be inhabited by aliens of great intelligence that could help human beings survive the current situation and survive the conditions it is currently experiencing.Ten years back,astronauts were sent to scout a dozen possible habitable planets.But now,the human beings final destination is being determined.Mindful of his children's future,Cooper agrees to pilot the craft together with Brand's daughter, Amelia; scientists Doyle and Romilly and the sardonic robot TARS.Later,Murph grows up into adulthood forming anger towards her father.She becomes an astronaut and Brand's second-in-charge working for the same entity that took her father away from her. The film depicts life on earth for the first 45 minutes.It establishes how humanity is suffering and the close father-and- daughter relationship between Cooper and Murph.The theme of sacrifice is fully explored especially after the father decided to leave his daughter for an space exploration for the sake of billions of people on the planet.It eventually disappoints Murph as she finds out that he may not be able to comeback.When the story shifts into space,the journey of the space exploration becomes the focus of the film.It was good to see Christopher Nolan limit the use of CGI effects so as not to overwhelm the viewer and let them go through the narrative which happens to be far from being clichéd and predictable.The conclusion is where it takes its chances as it tries to resolve the conflicts of the story with some questions left unanswered.Despite being 3 hours long,it was far from being boring for it does not drag and the story is told in a breakneck pace.This is a big-budgeted science fiction movie that is worth more than $160 million that has a very simple tale of love and sacrifice which later becomes breathtaking,hopeful and heartbreaking.It is another visual masterpiece from Nolan especially with the great special effects that is far from overwhelming but truly amazing.The operatic music from Hans Zimmer is also worth mentioning.The complex dialogue about the outer space can also be easily understood by the viewer regardless of one's educational background.Finally,it's an amazing achievement that deserves to be seen on the biggest screen with the best sound system possible. Watching it at home, no matter how good the sound system is, won't match. This one should definitely be seen inside a movie house for it is an awesome and incomparable theater experience.",10,7,14,10 November 2014

Lee Ermey, Arliss Howard and Adam Baldwin. The film follows a platoon of U.S. Marines through their training and the experiences of two of the platoon in the Tet Offensive during the Vietnam War. The film title refers to the full metal jacket bullet used by infantry riflemen.This film crystallizes the experience of the Vietnam War by concentrating on a group of raw Marine volunteers. The first half details the volunteers' harrowing boot-camp training under the profane, power-saw guidance of drill instructor Sgt. Hartman.While the second half takes place in Nam, as seen through the eyes of the now thoroughly indoctrinated marines.Full Metal Jacket is not a realistic film -- it is horror-comic surrealism, from a God's-eye view -- but it should fully engage the ordinary movie grunt.This is the most tightly crafted Kubrick film since Dr. Strangelove, as well as the most horrific; the first section alone accomplishes most of what The Shining failed to do.Aside from that,it was the harrowing, beautiful and characteristically eccentric new film about Vietnam, is going to puzzle, anger and fascinate audiences as much as any film he has made to date.Finally,it was an extremely graphic, violent Vietnam War film.",10,1,2,6 March 2012
The Grapes of Wrath," The Greatest Film Ever Made Until Citizen Kane Was Released
","The Grapes of Wrath is a drama directed by John Ford. It was based on John Steinbeck's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name. It features Henry Fonda,Jane Darwell,John Carradine,Shirley Mills,John Qualen and Eddie Quillan.The screenplay was written by Nunnally Johnson.The film tells the story of the Joads, an Oklahoma family, who, after losing their farm during the Great Depression in the 1930's, become migrant workers and end up in California. The motion picture details their arduous journey across the United States as they travel to California in search of work and opportunities for the family members.Tom Joad returns to his Oklahoma home after serving jail time for manslaughter. En route, Tom meets family friend Casey, a former preacher who warns Tom that dust storms, crop failures, and new agricultural methods have financially decimated the once prosperous Oklahoma farmland. Upon returning to his family farm, Tom is greeted by his mother, who tells him that the family is packing up for the 'promised land' of California. Warned that they shouldn't expect a warm welcome in California--they've already seen the caravan of dispirited farmers, heading back home after striking out at finding work--the Joads push on all the same. Their first stop is a wretched migrant camp, full of starving children and surrounded by armed guards. Further down the road, the Joads drive into an idyllic government camp, with clean lodging, indoor plumbing, and a self-governing clientele. When Tom ultimately bids goodbye to his mother, who asks him where he'll go, he delivers the film's most famous speech: 'I'll be all around...Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat...Whenever there's a cop beating a guy, I'll be there and when the people are eatin' the stuff they raise and livin' in the houses they build. I'll be there too.'Movies will probably go on improving and broadening themselves; but in any event, The Grapes of Wrath is the most mature picture story that has ever been made, in feeling, in purpose, and in the use of the medium.A potent drama that is as socially important today as when it was made, it is affecting, moving, and deservedly considered an American classic and a great adaptation of the novel.A documentary-styled production for which Ford and cinematographer Gregg Toland demanded painstaking authenticity, it is much more than a classy, old-fashioned history lesson. With dialogue and scenes that rank among the most moving and memorable ever filmed, it's a classic among classics or simply put, one of the finest films ever made.It was often named the greatest American film, until it was dethroned by Citizen Kane.",10,1,2,27 October 2012

It tells the story of Jamie 'Jim' Graham, a young boy who goes from living in a wealthy British family in Shanghai, to becoming a prisoner of war in Lunghua Civilian Assembly Center, a Japanese internment camp, during World War II.During the Japanese invasion, Jamie 'Jim' Graham is separated from his parents. With the help of soldier-of-fortune Basie,he learns to survive without a retinue of servants at his beck and call. By the time they are tossed into a Japanese prison camp, Jim has picked up enough street- smarts and developed enough intestinal fortitude to regard his imprisonment as an exciting adventure. The story ends during the 1945 liberation: on the verge of manhood, the 13-year-old Jim will never again be the pampered and privileged brat. The movie is always interesting from a narrative point of view. Spielberg is a good storyteller with a good tale to tell. But it never really adds up to anything as it barely emphasize that remarkable testament to the human spirit.It was beautiful but unfortunately,it was lacking World War II saga about the coming-of-age of Jim Graham.",8,1,4,25 September 2012

She struggles to hold on to the job and her sanity, knowing that a recommendation from Miranda can open nearly any door at any magazine, but can she handle the pressure without losing her mind along the way?The Devil Wears Prada is two films in one: a caustic, energetic satire of the fashion world and a cautionary melodrama.Also,the viewer gets an opportunity to witness Meryl Streep as a grand comedienne.Any other actress would have turned Miranda into a scenery-chewing Cruella, but Streep's underplayed, brilliant comic timing make her a fascinating, unapologetic character.This clever, funny big-screen adaptation of Weisberger's best-seller since it is a rare film that surpasses the quality of its source novel and it is a witty expose of New York's fashion scene.",10,1,2,27 September 2012
Rocky II," More Of A Love Story Than A Sports Film
","The sequel to Rocky happens to have two things that Rocky Balboa embrace in this movie: family life and a Hollywood ending. It focuses more on the love story and relationship between Rocky and his girlfriend,Adrian instead of him as an underdog and struggling pugilist.Rocky II is the sequel to Rocky, a motion picture in which an unknown boxer had been given a chance to go the distance with Apollo Creed,the World Heavyweight Champion. Sylvester Stallone, Carl Weathers, Tony Burton, Burgess Meredith, Burt Young and Talia Shire reprise their original roles. The story has Rocky Balboa,a Philadelphia prize fighter enjoying his brief fame after nearly defeating world heavyweight champion Apollo Creed. When Rocky is offered lucrative product endorsement opportunities, his limited education and lack of sophistication quickly become an impediment to his future success, causing him embarrassment and his pregnant wife, Adrian,a great deal of financial concern. Meanwhile, Creed is brooding over his near loss to a fighter he considers an amateur far beneath him and decides to goad a reluctant Rocky into a high-profile rematch. With the family resources dwindling and his pride wounded, Rocky decides that fighting is all he knows and makes the fateful decision to climb back into the ring once more with Creed to vie for the championship belt, despite assurances from all concerned that he will blind himself irreparably.In the end,we all know that Rocky wins this time against Apollo Creed and becomes the new World Heavyweight Champion.Just as I have stated,the movie has become more about the character of Rocky Balboa particularly his relationship with Adrian,his becoming a father and the financial conflicts they encounter after getting married.This is where the movie deviates from becoming a sports picture and becoming a love story instead.Nevertheless,it remains a good sequel but it deviates from more from Rocky the underdog boxer which made it more popular.Also,I do believe that the movie tried to go through a Hollywood ending this time with Rocky winning it all at the end. Although the cast did good in their performances,the second film did not hold a candle to the first Rocky,which I believe happens to be a cinema masterpiece and one of the greatest films ever made.Overall,it was still an enjoyable movie to watch.Personally,I rank Rocky II as the third best among the movie franchise behind Rocky and Rocky Balboa.",9,2,2,23 October 2011
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Attack of the Clones:An Improvement Over The Phantom Menace
","The second prequel to the original Star Wars trilogy takes place ten years after the events depicted in Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace.Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is an epic space opera film directed by George Lucas and written by Lucas and Jonathan Hales. It is the fifth film to be released in the Star Wars saga and the second in terms of the series' internal chronology.Now 20, young Anakin Skywalker is an apprentice to respected Jedi knight Obi-Wan Kenobi. Unusually powerful in the Force, Anakin is also impatient, arrogant, and headstrong -- causing his mentor a great deal of concern. The pair are ordered to protect Padme Amidala, the former queen of the planet Naboo, now representing her world in the Galactic Senate. Someone is trying to assassinate her on the eve of a vote enabling Supreme Chancellor Palpatine to build a military force that will safeguard against a growing separatist movement led by mysterious former Jedi Count Dooku. After another attempt on Padme's life, Obi-Wan and Anakin separate. The young Jedi and Padme fall in love as he escorts her first to the security of Naboo and then to his home world of Tatooine, where the fate of his mother leads him to commit an ominous atrocity. Meanwhile, Obi-Wan travels to the secretive planet Kamino and the asteroid-ringed world of Geonosis, following bounty hunter Jango Fett and his son, Boba, who are involved in an operation to create a massive army of clones. A vicious battle ensues between the clones and Jedi on one side and Dooku's droids on the other, but who is really pulling the strings in this galactic conflict? Clones is far from perfect, but when it clicks, it revives the old spirit that made a generation become so obsessed with all things Star Wars in the first place.While it lacks the quality of Empire's script and performances, it is the most visually enthralling of the series so far.It is certainly better than the childish Phantom Menace and the magic has definitely been recaptured.The acting was good as Christensen is a winning mix of sultry and sulky as the now older Anakin, while McGregor is finally beginning to relax as the mentor who understandably refuses to treat his moody pupil like a grown-up.But they all end up being upstaged by the jaw-dropping skills of a CGI creation: Yoda. Lucas has never been able to conjure another Han Solo, a character who could, with simply a wink, remind us that this was just an overgrown Saturday afternoon serial and worse a sort of movie we once loved and then outgrew. Although the scale of it is thrilling,it's too bad the movie is so muddled on so many different levels.But nevertheless,it was an improvement over The Phantom Menace.",9,10,15,14 January 2012

Lord and Lady Montague and Lord and Lady Capulet were given first names as opposed to the Shakespeare original where their first names are never mentioned, Friar Lawrence became Father Lawrence, and Prince Escalus was renamed Captain Prince.Additionally, a few plot details unimportant to the grand story arc were shifted; most notably, Juliet awakens just as Romeo poisons himself and the two see each other before he dies and she commits suicide.The movie was able to keep the integrity of Shakespeare's text.Credit goes mostly thanks to the actors speaking the very same lines of iambic pentameter as written four centuries ago.Despite a flawed start, Romeo & Juliet proves the story deserves an adjective often attached to it: timeless.The only thing about it is when the filmmakers decide to jazz it up with crazy camera angles and rapid cutting for great visual and when it updates the story for modern times with screaming and shooting, it just gets lost somehow.But still,it remains good for viewing.",9,1,1,8 January 2012
Forrest Gump," Forrest Gump: Implausible But A Masterpiece
","Forrest Gump is an epic comedy-drama romance film based on the 1986 novel of the same name by Winston Groom. It was directed by Robert Zemeckis and it stars Tom Hanks on the title role together Robin Wright and Gary Sinise.The supporting cast also include Sally Field as Mrs Gump,Mykelti Williamson and Haley Joel Osment.The screenplay by Eric Roth depicts several decades in the life of Forrest Gump, a native of Alabama who experiences firsthand, and contributes to, some of the defining events of the latter half of the 20th century while being largely unaware of their significance due to his below-average intelligence.'Stupid is as stupid does,' says Forrest Gump as he discusses his relative level of intelligence with a stranger while waiting for a bus. Despite his sub-normal IQ, Gump leads a truly charmed life, with a ringside seat for many of the most memorable events of the second half of the 20th century. Entirely without trying, Forrest teaches Elvis Presley to dance, becomes a football star, meets John F. Kennedy, serves with honor in Vietnam, meets Lyndon Johnson, speaks at an anti-war rally at the Washington Monument, hangs out with the Yippies, defeats the Chinese national team in table tennis, meets Richard Nixon, discovers the break-in at the Watergate, opens a profitable shrimping business, becomes an original investor in Apple Computers, and decides to run back and forth across the country for several years. Meanwhile, as the remarkable parade of his life goes by, Forrest never forgets Jenny, the girl he loved as a boy, who makes her own journey through the turbulence of the 1960s and 1970s that is far more troubled than the path Forrest happens upon.This is a sentimental film with sweetness and charm are occasionally enough to approximate true depth and grace.Although Roth's screenplay may somewhat look implausible as it is a chronicle of the long journey taken by a slow-witted boy through American history and politics,it definitely would provide sympathy to any viewer watching this film.Tom Hanks rose to the occasion with his unforgettable performance as Forrest Gump by providing high-caliber performance. This film simply belongs in company of such sweet classics as Rain Man and Harvey for it is moving,compelling and simply wonderful.And most of all,it is truly a masterpiece.",10,1,2,28 December 2011

"Monsters, Inc."," Charming Cartoon Classic
","After exploring the worlds of toys and bugs in the two Toy Story films and A Bug's Life, the award-winning computer animation company Pixar delves into the realm of monsters with its fourth feature entitled,Monster Inc.This computer-animated comedy-adventure film is directed by Pete Docter, released by Walt Disney Pictures, and the fourth film produced by Pixar Animation Studios. Co-directed by Lee Unkrich and David Silverman, it stars two monsters who work for a company named Monsters, Inc.: top scarer James P. Sullivan or Sulle,voiced by John Goodman and his one-eyed assistant, Mike Wazowski,voiced by Billy Crystal.Other voice overs is provided by Mary Gibbs,Steve Buscemi,James Coburn,Jennifer Tilly and Frank Oz.Monsters generate their city's power by scaring children, but they are terribly afraid themselves of being contaminated by children, so when one enters Monstropolis, Sulley finds his world disrupted.Hulking, blue-furred behemoth Sully and his one-eyed assistant Mike Wazowski are employed by Monsters, Inc., a scream processing factory. It seems that the denizens of their realm thrive on the screams of kids spooked by monsters lurking under their beds and in their closets. It's the job of Sully, Mike, and their co-workers, including sarcastic Randall Boggs, crab-like CEO Henry J. Waternoose, and lovely snake- headed receptionist Celia to keep the frights flowing. When Sully and Mike are followed back into the monster world by a very unafraid little human girl named Boo, they are exiled to her universe, where they discover that such a modern-day mythological specimen as the Abominable Snowman is a fellow refugee.Even though Monsters, Inc lacks the sophistication of the Toy Story series, it is a still delight for children of all ages due to the fact that John Lasseter and the Pixar crew know how to turn shared human feelings and experiences into strange and delightful animated features.No doubt that this is one of their most solid efforts.Aside from that,it is a charming cartoon classic.",10,1,2,21 October 2012

","American Hustle is a comedy-drama of a crime genre that is loosely based on the FBI ABSCAM operation of the 1970's and 1980's.It features two interesting actor/actress pair - Amy Adams and Christian Bale - together with another pair - Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper - that worked together in previously in Academy Award nominated films The Fighter and Silver Lining Playback respectively.The story is about two con artists that were forced to work with an FBI agent to capture a sting operation. David O. Russell directs.During the 70's and the 80's,a ring of crooked deals were captured on video by the FBI at the backdrop of New Jersey.That led to almost a dozen arrests of U.S. senators, members of the U.S. House of Representatives and other politicians.Ambitious FBI agent Richie DiMaso forces the aid of the a con artists pair:Irving Rosenfeld, a small-time criminal who deals in stolen and faked art as well as fake loan scams; and his seductive British partner Sydney Prosser,who is also known as Lady Edith Greensly. The pair are forced to assist the FBI in nabbing other con artists and crooks in the area after being caught in one of his cons by DiMaso. When a chain of evidence mounts that leads towards corruption in the office of Mayor Carmine Polito, DiMaso concocts a scam that will ultimately bring down many politicians that includes Polito himself.Disgusted by their forced employment with DiMaso after he discovers mob ties that may ultimately lead to his own death,Irving and his partner make a ploy to begin a scheme of their own to get out from it.What makes matters worse is the fact that Irving's wife,Rosalyn tries desperately to retain Irving's affection and attention by constantly interfering with him.This is definitely one of the best films during its year of release.The performances of Bale,Adams,Cooper and most especially Lawrence are definitely great and memorable.They played their characters interestingly and passionately as they were able to switch from comedy to drama with ease.Also,they obviously researched their characters very well.No wonder that all of them were nominated for an Oscar.Added to that,the movie has lots of fun and energy as it was engaging from beginning to end.Added to that,the killer 70's soundtrack definitely made it enjoyable as well.Despite lacking intelligence and the unevenness of the story,the viewer will definitely get their money's worth with the heartwarming performances of the lead stars alone.",10,1,4,16 April 2014
The Godfather: Part II," The Godfather Part II: The Greatest Sequel Ever Made
","If The Godfather is the greatest film ever made,then The Godfather Part II is the greatest sequel ever made. It is Francis Ford Coppola's continuation of Mario Puzo's Mafia saga set new standards for sequels that have yet to be matched or broken until present. The Godfather Part II chronicles the story of the Corleone family following the events of the first film while also depicting the rise to power of the young Vito Corleone,played by excellently Robert De Niro in his Academy Award winning performance.The film stars Al Pacino, Robert Duvall,Diane Keaton,Robert De Niro,Talia Shire, John Cazale, Michael V. Gazzo and Lee Strasberg.The movie is a depiction of the dark side of the American dream. In the early 1900s, the child Vito flees his Sicilian village for America after the local Mafia kills his family. Vito struggles to make a living, legally or illegally, for his wife and growing brood in Little Italy, killing the local Black Hand Fanucci after he demands his customary cut of the tyro's business. With Fanucci gone, Vito's communal stature grows, but it is his family (past and present) who matters most to him - - a familial legacy then upended by Michael's business expansion in the 1950s. Now based in Lake Tahoe, Michael conspires to make inroads in Las Vegas and Havana pleasure industries by any means necessary. As he realizes that allies like Hyman Roth are trying to kill him, the increasingly paranoid Michael also discovers that his ambition has crippled his marriage to Kay and turned his brother, Fredo, against him. Barely escaping a federal indictment, Michael turns his attention to dealing with his enemies, completing his own corruption.The film still has a strong performance from the cast despite not having Marlon Brando in it.Aside from De Niro,Al Pacino, Robert Duvall,Diane Keaton,John Cazale and Lee Strasberg provide honest performances. Still present in the film is the haunting score of Nino Rota;the superb screenplay of both Puzo and Coppola; and the excellent direction of Copolla.But it has darker themes as compared to the first film as the characters are violent and amoral in their values.Also,the story presents the deterioration of the characters as the viewers feel for them in their pain and vulnerability. It may not be the ultimate family picture but nevertheless,it remains as the greatest sequel ever made and definitely one of the best films ever made.",10,4,6,18 October 2011

The Aviator," All About Howard Hughes
","Martin Scorsese directed this fast-moving, epic-scale biopic documenting the life and loves one of the most colorful Americans of the 20th century, Howard Hughes.The Aviator is a biographical drama film directed by Scorsese, written by John Logan, and starring Leonardo DiCaprio together with together with Cate Blanchett,Alan Alda,Alec Baldwin,Kate Beckinsale,John C. Reilly,Gwen Stefani and Jude Law. It is the story of aviation pioneer Howard Hughes, drawn largely upon numerous sources including a biography by Charles Higham.The film centers on Hughes' life from the late 1920s to 1947, during which time he became a successful film producer and an aviation magnate while simultaneously growing more unstable due to severe obsessive-compulsive disorder. The Aviator follows Hughes as the twenty-something millionaire, having already made a fortune improving the design of oil-drilling bits, comes to Hollywood with an interest in getting into the picture business. It doesn't take long for Hughes, with his passion for airplanes, to jump from producer to director of his first major film project, a World War I air epic called Hell's Angels, which took three years to complete thanks to the shift from silent to sound filming and Hughes' relentless perfectionism. However, the film was a massive hit, and the eccentric inventor became a mogul in Hollywood, making Jean Harlow a star and enjoying a romance with Katharine Hepburn. But Hollywood's old-boy network never fully accepted Hughes, and in time his passion for flying began to reclaim his attentions as he began designing new planes, setting air speed records, flying around the world, and risking his life testing aircraft. Hughes also found time to romance Ava Gardner and founded his own airline, Trans-World Airlines, though as his ideas became bolder, his approach became more eccentric, and he gained many powerful enemies, including the head of Pan-American Airlines, Juan Trippe, and Senator Ralph Owen Brewster, who attempted to prove that Hughes' radical design ideas were actually part of an effort to bilk taxpayers for millions of dollars through government contracts. The movie is all rather sprawling and a bit disjointed, but Scorsese's vigorous pacing and eye for detail hold it all together and provide a vivid setting for DiCaprio's masterful performance.Scorsese gives us a lot more than the Charles Foster Kane of the clouds. He keeps focus on Hughes, the dreamer, who continually reached out, grabbed the future and pulled it toward him.But still,the story almost predictable in the way it delivers the cinematic goods, yet there's no denying that it is a compelling and entertaining look at a larger-than-life individual.This biopic of Howard Hughes is being hailed as another excellent film.",9,1,2,10 January 2012
Léon: The Professional," Great Breakout By Natalie Portman
","Léon: The Professional is a French thriller film written and directed by Luc Besson. It stars Jean Reno as the titular mob hit-man, Gary Oldman as corrupt DEA agent Stansfield, a young Natalie Portman, in her feature film debut, as Mathilda, a 12-year-old girl who is taken in by the hit-man after her family is murdered, and Danny Aiello as Tony, the mobster who gives the hit-man his assignments.As visually stylish as it is graphically violent, this thriller directed by Luc Besson concerns Mathilda, a 12-year-old girl living in New York City who has been exposed to the sordid side of life from an early age: her family lives in a slum and her abusive father works for drug dealers, cutting and storing dope. Mathilda doesn't much care for her parents, but she has a close bond with her four-year-old brother. One day, she returns from running an errand to discover that most of her family, including her brother, have been killed in a raid by corrupt DEA agents, led by the psychotic Stansfield. Mathilda takes refuge in the apartment of her secretive neighbor, Leon, who takes her in with a certain reluctance. She discovers that Leon is a professional assassin, working for Tony, a mob kingpin based in Little Italy. Wanting to avenge the death of her brother, Mathilda makes a deal with Leon to become his protégée in exchange for work as a domestic servant, hoping to learn the hit-man's trade and take out the men who took her brother's life. However, an affection develops between Leon and Mathilda that changes his outlook on his life and career. Besson's first American film boasted a strong performance from Jean Reno, a striking debut by Natalie Portman, and a love-it-or-hate-it, over-the-top turn by Gary Oldman. Aside from that,pivoting on the unusual relationship between seasoned hit-man and his 12-year-old apprentice -- a breakout turn by young Natalie Portman -- Luc Besson's Léon is a stylish and oddly affecting thriller.It was one pretty awesome action movie.",10,2,3,27 February 2012

","Oblivion is a science fiction film that stars Tom Cruise, Olga Kurylenko, Andrea Riseborough, Morgan Freeman, Melissa Leo, Zoë Bell, and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau.It is about one of the last mechanics remaining on earth that on a spectacular future Earth that has evolved beyond recognition and his confrontation with the past will lead him on a journey of redemption and discovery as he battles to save mankind.It is based on his unpublished graphic novel of the same title of the movie edited by Radical Comics.It is co-written, produced and directed by Joseph Kosinski.Following an alien invasion 60 years earlier which nearly destroyed the planet, former Marine commander Jack Harper is one of the last few drone mechanics stationed on Earth. Jacks lives in an airborne tower floating thousands of feet above the Earth which he and his colleague are part of the operation to clean up the remaining forces of the invasion and extract the planet's remaining resources. Nearing the end of his mission, Jack rescues a female stranger from a crashed spaceship. Following her arrival, he is captured by an insurgency led by the mysterious Malcolm Beech and following a series of events he is forced to question everything he knows about the invasion and its aftermath. Inside the insurgent camp, it is demanded that he repair a recently captured drone to not fire on them. His colleague back at the tower then sends a drone to scout the area for Jack, but it is soon disarmed by members of the resistance. Jack successfully manages to plea for his release, being that more Drones would be sent for him if he were to stay. He manages to return with the female stranger, who is actually revealed to be his long lost wife, Julia. The ship he found her in was actually a NASA shuttle that had been orbiting around Earth for 60 years. This also shows that Jack is actually one of the many clones taken from the actual Jack Harper, that helps repair drones and scout for alien presence.With a reality that is shattered as he discovers shocking truths that connect him to Earth of the past, Jack will be pushed to a heroism he didn't know he contained within. The fate of humanity now rests solely in the hands of a man who believed our world was soon to be lost foreverOblivion is a visual feast with strong performances and an intriguing central mystery, but it's slightly let down by a nakedly derivative script and a general lack of warmth.The script's philosophical musings about humanity and self-sacrifice are almost as flimsy as the central love triangle that fails to ignite the emotional afterburners for a slam-bang finale.It's a shame the lack of originality becomes a distraction forty minutes in and the spectacle isn't enough to stem the overriding sense of déjà vu that does its best to dazzle by its myriad of special effects but confuses itself.Overall,it tries hard to resurrect the spirit of '60s and '70s sci-fi may impress with its scale.It can be enjoyed by a Tom Cruise fan and someone who loves these types of movie but it is far from being a masterpiece and an unforgettable film.",9,11,28,10 April 2013
Burn After Reading," Coen Brothers Delivers In Burn After Reading
","Burn After Reading is a black comedy film written, produced, and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen. The film stars George Clooney, John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, and Brad Pitt.The movie begins with CIA agent Osborne Cox losing his job. This prompts his long-suffering, unfaithful wife to consult a lawyer about divorcing him. Osborne decides to write a book about his exploits, but an early draft of his work ends up lost at a gym where it's found by the dim- witted Chad, and the plastic-surgery obsessed Linda. They decide to blackmail Osborne in order to help Linda pay for the numerous procedures she wants to undergo. Things grow even more complicated when Linda starts an affair with Harry, who also happens to be sleeping with Cox's wife.Two days later at the CIA headquarters, an official named Palmer and his director learn that information from Osbourne has been given to the Russian Embassy. They are perplexed and decide to maintain observation until the situation 'makes sense.'Harry, increasingly anxious after killing a man he believes was a government spy, gets into an argument with Katie and decides to leave the house. On his way out, he spots a man who has been trailing him for the past several days. After tackling him to the ground, Harry finds out that the man is a process server tasked with giving him divorce papers from his wife Sandy (Elizabeth Marvel), who is having an extramarital liaison of her own. Harry is devastated and goes to see an agitated Linda, who confides in Harry that her friend Chad is missing; he agrees to try to help find him.The next morning, Harry and Linda meet in a park, and she provides him with more information about Chad's disappearance. When Harry realizes that Chad is the man he killed, he flees in terror, assuming Linda is also a spy. Linda then turns to Ted Treffon, the kindhearted manager of Hardbodies, who has unrequited feelings for her. Believing the Russians have kidnapped Chad, he agrees to go to the Cox home to search Osbourne's computer. Unemployed and having spent the past several days living on a small boat, Osbourne becomes unhinged when he finds out that his wife has emptied his bank accounts, and, no longer having keys, decides to break into the house to get some of his personal belongings. Finding Ted in the basement, Osbourne initially takes him to be Katie's lover and fires a gunshot at him. Ted manages to get out of the house, only to be fatally attacked by a hatchet-wielding Osbourne. At CIA headquarters a few days later, Palmer and his director try to understand what exactly happened. It is revealed that while trying to board a flight to Venezuela, Harry was detained because his name was on a hot list, Chad's body has been disposed of and the CIA are holding Linda who is promising to keep quiet about everything if they will pay for her cosmetic surgery. A CIA agent shot Osbourne during his hatchet assault on Ted and the bullet has put Osbourne in a coma. The director instructs Palmer to let Harry fly to Venezuela, mistakenly saying that the US has no extradition treaty with Venezuela, decides the CIA will pay for Linda's surgery and postpones considering Osbourne's situation until he regains consciousness, which is not likely. The director tells Palmer that they did not really learn anything.This is a quirky tale of lust, greed, vanity, idiocy and ineptitude that spreads its giggly ripples through the bureaucratic buildings and leafy suburbs of Washington, D.C. But nevertheless,the Coen Brothers have crafted another clever comedy/thriller with an outlandish plot and memorable characters.The acting was excellent. Frances McDormand,who got a Golden Globe nomination,should have been nominated for an Academy Award for she was great and outstanding. Obviously,the movie was disjointed, fragmented and frustrated but that what makes it great and a must-see.",10,2,4,5 January 2012

In order to cinch the deal, he even enlists John's reluctant safecracking-prodigy daughter, Stella, for an elaborate, incognito Los Angeles heist. But the paranoid Steve proves himself to be one step ahead of them at just about every turn, and Charlie finds that he'll have to make some daring last-minute changes to their plan if the team is to succeed.F. Gary Gray has crafted a fun summer film packed with action, comedy, and a talented ensemble cast.Also,it offers some agreeably mindless fun in which the villains are truly villainous, the payback is satisfying in a purely infantile way, and the familiarity of everything is oddly comforting.Overall,it was an entertaining film thanks mainly to the charismatic cast.",9,1,2,26 September 2012
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Fellowship Manages To Thrill
","New Zealand filmmaker Peter Jackson fulfills his lifelong dream of transforming author J.R.R. Tolkien's best-selling fantasy epic into a three-part motion picture that begins with this holiday 2001 release.This fantasy film based on the first volume of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings.Set in Middle-earth, the story tells of the Dark Lord Sauron, who is seeking the One Ring. The Ring has found its way to the young hobbit Frodo Baggins. The fate of Middle-earth hangs in the balance as Frodo and eight companions who form the Fellowship of the Ring begin their journey to Mount Doom in the land of Mordor, the only place where the Ring can be destroyed.Frodo Baggins, a Hobbit resident of the medieval 'Middle-earth' who discovers that a ring bequeathed to him by beloved relative and benefactor Bilbo is in fact the 'One Ring,' a device that will allow its master to manipulate dark powers and enslave the world. Frodo is charged by the wizard Gandalf to return the ring to Mount Doom, the evil site where it was forged millennia ago and the only place where it can be destroyed. Accompanying Frodo is a fellowship of eight others: his Hobbit friends Sam, Merry, and Pippin; plus Gandalf; the human warriors Aragorn and Boromir; Elf archer Legolas; and Dwarf soldier Gimli. The band's odyssey to the dreaded land of Mordor, where Mount Doom lies, takes them through the Elfish domain of Rivendell and the forest of Lothlorien, where they receive aid and comfort from the Elf princess Arwen, her father, Elrond, and Queen Galadriel. In pursuit of the travelers and their ring are Saruman -- a traitorous wizard and kin, of sorts, to Gandalf -- and the Dark Riders, under the control of the evil, mysterious Sauron. The Fellowship must also do battle with a troll, flying spies, Orcs, and other deadly obstacles both natural and otherwise as they draw closer to Mordor.Peter Jackson has not only attempted the most ambitious film project in modern cinema history, he's pulled it off with a breathtaking mixture of nerve and verve, too.Visually striking, thematically poignant, and morally weighty, the first film of Lord of the Rings is superb for it manages to thrill and enthrall despite its length and repetition.The production design is a marvel, and the special effects are dazzling but nevertheless,it manages to stay attuned to the story and the character.",10,1,1,12 January 2012
The Matrix Revolutions," The Weakest Film Among The Matrix Trilogy
","Shot back-to-back with The Matrix Reloaded, the third and final installment by Andy Wachowski and Larry Wachowski's sci-fi action saga picks up where the second film left off.This science fiction action film and the third installment of The Matrix trilogy features Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss together with Hugo Weaving,Jada Pinkett Smith,Harry J. Lennix and Harold Perrineau.Once more Neo, Morpheus, Trinity and the evil Agent Smith returns, and the epic battle for control of Zion and the human race concludes in this explosive finale of the Matrix Trilogy.Neo remains unconscious in the real world, caught in a mysterious subway station that lies between the machine world and the Matrix, and Bane is still a conduit for Agent Smith, who continues to grow out of control, threatening to destroy both worlds. Meanwhile, as the sentinels get closer and closer to Zion, the citizens of the earth's last inhabited city prepare for the inevitable onslaught. By bargaining with The Merovingian, Trinity and Morpheus are able to free Neo who, after meeting with The Oracle, decides that he must leave Zion and head for the machine mainframe. As Neo and Trinity venture into the dangerous machine world, with hopes of stopping both the machines and Agent Smith, their comrades in Zion attempt to fight off the attacking sentinels with the odds stacked greatly against them. The last film of the Matrix Trilogy is disappointing conclusion due to the fact that the characters and ideas take a back seat to the special effects.This final installment is both too much of a good thing and too little.The Wachowski brothers have rendered their chronicles into banality, as if trying to imitate the qualitative tailspin of the Star Wars series.As an action movie, it's talky and consists of heavy violence but has a weaker script compared to its predecessors.But what really makes this film ordinary is that there's nothing even resembling a surprise.Too bad that one of the most original concepts in recent fantasy movie history has devolved into something weak in the conclusion of the trilogy.In the end,this final film does not elevate the franchise but only becomes a weak addition to it.",8,1,2,28 October 2012
Man of Steel," Man Of Steel Is A Visual Spectacle
","Based on the DC Comics character Superman, Man Of Steel is a reboot of the the film series.It features the character's origin story when he was sent from an exploding Planet Krypton to Earth by his father,Jor-El; and how he stops General Zod from creating imminent destruction when he grows up to be Superman. It stars Henry Cavill in the title role together with Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, Diane Lane,Kevin Costner,Laurence Fishburne and Russell Crowe.Zack Snyder directs the film.The movie starts with the introductory Krypton sequence. It's some of the best material the movie has to offer as the special effects on the dying planet is visually impressive and the acting by Russell Crowe as Jor-El is simply outstanding as he is simply heroic and charismatic. With Krypton nearing its end, he places his little boy into a spacecraft and sends him to Earth. Meanwhile, General Zod attempts a coup, fails, and is sentenced to spend some time in The Phantom Zone for his troubles.Then we meet Clark Kent.After saving some men on a doomed oil rig, Clark floats around in the water experiencing convenient flashbacks to his childhood living in Kansas with his parents. Once these are done, he heads north and reaches the Fortress of Solitude, which is actually a spaceship buried under arctic ice. In the spaceship, Clark meets an avatar of his dad and gets his costume. It's around this time that Zod and his followers, freed from The Phantom Zone, reach Earth.Then a Clark comes to a decision:Must Superman live anonymously or taking a front seat as the planet's defender? The choice of Henry Cavill is good enough but it will never hold a candle to what Christopher Reeve brought to the screen many years ago. But nevertheless,he plays the part very well.As a supervillain, Michael Shannon does a good job overacting as Zod. Unfortunately,Amy Adams is somewhat miscast as Lois Lane.She simply does not feel right for the role due to her lack of chemistry with Cavill.Their relationship looks fake and unreal. The others are great like Laurence Fishburne as Perry White, although he has very little screen time. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are great as Clark's parents - Jonathan and Martha Kent. Man of Steel is a great spectacle. The special effects are first rate and the action sequences are delivered very well. It's a style over substance thing.Snyder never ceases to amaze visually.Unfortunately,it was spectacle over heart.As far as story telling and direction is concerned,there is nothing original in it except the fact that there is endless violence and destruction in the film.And it definitely lacks romance and humor.In summary,the reboot of Superman will not be as great as the when it was first released back in the 1970's and it will never be at par with Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight series.",7,3,8,31 July 2013
Footloose," Very Little Dancing
","In this lively adolescent-oriented musical, a city kid attempts to adapt to life in an ultra-conservative backwater Midwestern town. Once there, he ends up leading the repressed teenagers into a rebellion against the town fathers, who have outlawed rock & roll and dancing in Footloose.It stars Kevin Bacon,Lori Singer,Dianne Wiest and John Lithgow. It tells the story of Ren McCormack, an upbeat Chicago teen who moves to a small town in which, as a result of the efforts of a local minister, dancing and rock music have been banned.It is loosely based on events that took place in the small, rural, and religious community of Elmore City, Oklahoma.It was directed by Herbert Ross.Ren McCormack, a teenager raised in Chicago, moves with his mother to the small Rocky Mountain town of Bomont to live with his aunt and uncle after his father leaves them. Soon after arriving, Ren makes a friend named Willard, and learns the city council banned dancing and rock music after several teens were killed in an accident six years earlier. He soon begins to fall for a rebellious girl named Ariel, who has a boyfriend, Chuck Cranston, and an overprotective father, Rev. Shaw Moore ,a powerful member of the town council. Rev. Moore's son--and Ariel's older brother--died in the crash.After trading insults with Ariel's boyfriend, Ren is challenged to a game of chicken involving tractors. Despite not knowing how to drive a tractor, he wins. Rev. Moore mistrusts Ren, forbidding Ariel to see him and using his influence to have Ren kicked off the gymnastics team. Ren and his classmates want to do away with the ban on dancing and have a senior prom. He presses on despite gaining a reputation as a 'troublemaker'; his efforts cause his mother to get fired on the pretense that she isn't being a good mother, and also cost his uncle business. Moore's wife is supportive of the movement, and explains to Moore he cannot be everyone's father, and that he is hardly being a father to Ariel. She also says that dancing and music are not the problem.Ren goes before the city council and reads several Bible verses provided to him by Ariel in order to cite scriptural support for the worth of dancing to rejoice, exercise, or celebrate. Although Rev. Moore is moved, he and the other council members vote to keep the ban. Ren initially gives up, but his boss at a flour mill tells him that the mill is located just outside the town limits, and offers to let the kids use it for their prom. Meanwhile, Moore has a change of heart after seeing some of the townsfolk burning books that they think are dangerous to the youth. Realizing the situation has gotten out of hand, Moore stops the burning.On Sunday, Rev. Moore asks his congregation to pray for the high school students putting on the prom. Moore and his wife are seen outside, dancing for the first time in years. Cranston and several of his friends show up and challenge Ren and Willard to a fight, but Ren and Willard easily fend them off and go back inside. Ren triumphantly yells, 'Let's dance!'What is surprising about the movie is that it has very little dancing.Also,it was cheesy to that point that rock and roll music is a devil's music.What's worse,the ending was simply contrived and manipulated as the Reverend accepted rock and roll without any convincing reason whatsoever. The only good thing about it the great acting of Kevin Bacon and Kenny Loggins' music,Footloose.",7,1,4,3 January 2012

Cast Away," Cast Away Is A Fascinating Film
","Academy Award-winning director Robert Zemeckis and two-time Oscar winner Tom Hanks reunite to explore the blessings and heartache of fate and the survival of the human spirit in this moving drama entitled Cast Away.Hanks stars as Chuck Noland, a FedEx systems engineer whose ruled- by-the-clock existence abruptly ends when a harrowing plane crash leaves him isolated on a remote island.Helen Hunt,Nick Searcy, Jenifer Lewis,Chris Noth,Lari White,Vince Martin and Geoffrey Blake co-star to play key supporting roles.This is an exploration of human survival and the ability of fate to alter even the tidiest of lives with one major event.Cast Away tells the story of Noland, a Fedex engineer who devotes most of his life to his troubleshooting job.

Finding solace only in a volleyball that he befriends, Chuck must now learn to endure the emotional and physical stress of his new life, unsure of when he may return to the civilization he knew before.This film isn't the first to recognize our modern need for primal tales, but it is among the most accomplished. It plugs straight into our unplugged fantasies.And definitely,it is more than just a similarity with Robinson Crusoe.Tom Hanks gives one of the towering screen performances of all time as his scenes of complete isolation on the island, where barely a sound is heard for minutes at a time, are the best thing about it.Overall,it offers an intelligent script, some of Robert Zemeckis' most mature directing, and a showcase performance from talented Tom Hanks in this fascinating film.",9,1,1,6 October 2012
The Thing," The Thing Is A Masterpiece
","John Carpenter's The Thing is both a remake of Howard Hawks' 1951 film of the same name and a re-adaptation of the John W. Campbell Jr. story 'Who Goes There?' on which it was based. This science fiction horror film is directed by John Carpenter and written by Bill Lancaster.It features Kurt Russell together with Wilford Brimley,Keith David,Donald Moffat and Charles Hallahan. The title refers to its primary antagonist: a parasitic extraterrestrial lifeforms that assimilates other organisms and in turn imitates them.It infiltrates an Antarctic research station, taking the appearance of the researchers that it absorbs, and paranoia occurs within the group.Carpenter's film is more faithful to Campbell's story than Hawks' version and also substantially more reliant on special effects, provided in abundance by a team of over 40 technicians, including veteran creature-effects artists Rob Bottin and Stan Winston.The screenplay opens enigmatically with a Siberian Husky running through the Antarctic tundra, chased by two men in a helicopter firing at it from above. Even after the dog finds shelter at an American research outpost, the men in the helicopter land and keep shooting. One of the Norwegians drops a grenade and blows himself and the helicopter to pieces; the other is shot dead in the snow by Garry, the American outpost captain. American helicopter pilot MacReady and camp doctor Copper fly off to find the Norwegian base and discover some pretty strange goings-on. The base is in ruins, and the only occupants are a man frozen to a chair and the burned remains of what could be one man or several men. In a side room, Copper and MacReady find a coffin-like block of ice from which something has been recently cut. That night at the American base, the Husky changes into the Thing, and the Americans learn first-hand that the creature has the ability to mutate into anything it kills. For the rest of the film the men fight a losing battle against it, never knowing if one of their own dwindling number is the Thing in disguise.The Thing is a peerless masterpiece of relentless suspense, retina- wrecking visual excess and outright, nihilistic terror.This is one of Carpenter's greatest moments, creating a terrifying atmosphere of claustrophobia, suspense and paranoia. And Kurt Russell is as good as he's ever been, wearing one of the best beards in movie history.Added to that,the special effects can't hope to be as creepy to our seen-it-all eyes as they were to the film's first viewers, but we can still enjoy the monster's unique weirdness, and the story is a rock-solid yarn.And most of all,it is not just an excellent remake, it's an excellent movie, and an almost perfect horror movie as it shows more originality, wit and invention than possibly any other film in its category.Also,it is as influential as Alien for its blend of action, sci-fi and chilling horror.Finally,it is a masterpiece.",10,1,3,24 October 2012

He Got Game," Spike Lee And Denzel Washington Shines
","Denzel Washington and writer-director Spike Lee team for the third time with this contemporary basketball drama focusing on a promising athlete, the son of a convict-father entitled,He Got Game.It is sports-drama film written and directed Lee. It stars Washington as Jake Shuttlesworth, a prison inmate convicted for killing his wife. The father of the top- ranked basketball prospect in the country, Jesus Shuttlesworth,played by NBA star Ray Allen, Jake is released on parole for a week by the state's governor in order to persuade his son to play for the governor's alma mater in exchange for a heavily-reduced prison sentence.The film also features Milla Jovovich,John Turturro,Rosario Dawson and Jim Brown with Ned Beatty and John Turturro.Jake Shuttlesworth has been in prison for six years when tough prison- warden Wyatt tells him that he's getting a temporary parole with the promise of a commuted sentence. However, there's a trade-off -- Jake must talk his son, Jesus Shuttlesworth, the top-ranked high-school basketball player in the country, into signing with the governor's alma mater, Big State. A flashback makes it clear that Jesus' mother was accidentally killed by Jake during a violent family fight. After Jake went to prison, the resentful Jesus was left alone to raise his sister Mary. Now several colleges are offering Jesus scholarships, and montages satirize the manner in which young athletes are wooed by educators and coaches across the country. However, Jake will soon be back behind bars if he can't get Jesus to sign with Big State within the week. Meanwhile, the greed of other family members begins to surface.The movie presents a realistic view on how athletes particularly basketball players are recruited by universities in their rosters.Aside from that,it also presents a vibrantly colorful father-son melodrama that would touch the viewers.Lee provides an artsy color film feature that was aided by great music from Aaron Copeland and Public Enemy.The story is moving especially when it becomes personal on both Jake and Jesus' part.The performances of Denzel Washington and Ray Allen,in his film debut,are also worthy to be mentioned. Overall,it may not be a great film but it is still worth your time especially for people who loves basketball.",10,1,3,23 December 2011

Trouble with the Curve," Eastwood's Final Acting Role Turns Out A Surprise
","Trouble with the Curve is a sports drama film starring Clint Eastwood in his supposed final acting role together with Amy Adams, Justin Timberlake, Matthew Lillard, and John Goodman. The film revolves around an aging baseball scout whose daughter joins him on a scouting trip. Robert Lorenz directed it.Gus Lobel has been one of the best scouts in baseball for decades, but, despite his efforts to hide it, age is starting to catch up with him. Nevertheless, Gus, who can tell a pitch just by the crack of the bat, refuses to be benched for what may be the final innings of his career. He may not have a choice. The front office of the Atlanta Braves is starting to question his judgment, especially with the country's hottest batting phenom on deck for the draft. He is given one last assignment to prove his worth to the organization, which sees him as unable to adapt to changes in the business. His boss and friend Pete, who does not want to see him let go, asks Gus's daughter Mickey to join him on the trip to make sure he's okay, against Gus's wishes. Together they scout a top new prospect in North Carolina, where Mickey begins to take an active role in her father's work to make up for his failing vision, which he has hidden from his bosses. Along the way Gus reconnects with Johnny, a rival team's scout who has a friendly history with Gus, as Gus was the man who scouted him when he was a baseball player, and who also takes an interest in Mickey. Though predictable and somewhat dramatically underwhelming, it benefits from Eastwood's grizzled charisma as he looks a in his 80's and lot trimmer compared to some of the performers in this film half his age. He may be the only octogenarian actor who has to play older than his age to be convincing. Added to that, his easy chemistry with a charming Adams benefits the film so much. Both do the best they can with the cornball sentimentality and cheesy dialogue which turns out great as this film is a stunning, beautiful surprise. Like the baseball diamond that features so prominently, we all know which base will be dutifully tapped next and that a home run for the characters is inevitable. It is a sports movie, a romance without sentimentality, and the emotional trauma of a family secret.",9,3,4,28 March 2013
Bridge of Spies," Hanks And Spielberg Collaboration In A Cold War Film
","Actor Tom Hanks and Director Steven Spielberg once again teams up to make a historical Cold War drama thriller about an American lawyer who was asked to negotiate the release of an American spy whose U-S plane was shot down in the Soviet Union.The result of the tandem's 6th partnership is Bridge Of Spies.James B. Donovan is an insurance lawyer who was asked to defend an accused spy Rudolf Abel,who was caught in some illegal activities in the United States.The prosecutors were thinking that he will not take the case seriously amidst the Cold War.But apparently he did.Despite of being proved guilty,he avoided the death penalty for his client.Also,Donovan tried his best to defend Abel up to appealing his case in the Supreme Court.Years after,Donovan was asked to negotiate for the release of Francis Gary Powers,an American spy was caught in the USSR after the U2 pilot plane was shot down.They did this through an exchange of spies with the United States releasing Abel and the Soviets releasing Powers.Aside from that,Donovan also worked for the release of Frederic Pryor,an American economics graduate student,who was visiting his German girlfriend in East Berlin. The film was interesting.No question about it.While the film had an understated impact,the unpredictability of the characters kept the movie interesting from beginning to end.It was nice to see a something wherein friendship is developed among people who wouldn't trust each other.As for the performances,Tom Hanks could be considered superb.But Mark Rylance definitely deserves an Academy Award nomination for being great as the Soviet spy Abel.As for Spielberg,he still remains the best director when it comes using visual images in telling the story.This deserves the highest rating.",10,2,4,22 February 2016

If the trio is unable to locate and destroy them all, Voldemort will remain immortal. Despite their long friendship, a combination of dark forces, romantic tensions, and long- held secrets threaten to sabotage the mission.Deliberate, nervy sequel that wisely matures with the fan base. The deliberation and general caution of the picture is a perfect way to say good-bye to this amazing run of feature films.Also, the good outweighs the mediocre, so in the end this is one of the better installments in the series.Deathly Hallows: Part I is obviously a beautifully filmed, emotionally satisfying penultimate installment for the Harry Potter series.",10,1,2,20 October 2012
American Psycho," An Underrated Masterpiece
","American Psycho is a cult psychological thriller and satirical film directed by Mary Harron based on Bret Easton Ellis's novel of the title. It stars Christian Bale, Willem Dafoe, Jared Leto, Josh Lucas, Justin Theroux, Bill Sage, Chloë Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon, and Samantha Mathis. The film focuses on Wall Street yuppie Patrick Bateman, whose mental instability and blood lust lead him to serial killing.Patrick Bateman, the son of a wealthy Wall Street financier, is pursuing his own lucrative career with his father's firm. Bateman is the prototypical yuppie, obsessed with success, fashion, and style. He is also a serial killer who murders, rapes, and mutilates both strangers and acquaintances without provocation or reason. Donald Kimble, a police detective, questions Bateman about the disappearance of Paul Allen, whom Patrick murdered several days earlier. As Kimble stays on Bateman's trail, Bateman's mask of studied, distant cool begins to fall apart. This satire cleverly equates materialism, narcissism, misogyny, and classicism with homicide, but you may laugh at the protagonist that you won't be able to hear yourself laughing with him.But nevertheless,Bale nails Bateman with a sublimely dead-eyed and deadpan performance.Also,it captures the 80's era when the events of this film happened.Overall,it is an underrated masterpiece.",9,1,1,18 September 2012

North by Northwest," Laid The Groundwork For Countless Action Thrillers
","North by Northwest is a thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, starring Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint and James Mason. The screenplay was written by Ernest Lehman, who wanted to write 'the Hitchcock picture to end all Hitchcock pictures'.North by Northwest is a tale of mistaken identity, with an innocent man pursued across the United States by agents of a mysterious organization who want to stop his interference in their plans to smuggle out microfilm containing government secrets.Author and journalist Nick Clooney praised Lehman's original story and sophisticated dialogue, calling the film 'certainly Alfred Hitchcock's most stylish thriller, if not his best'.This is one of several Hitchcock movies with a music score by Bernard Herrmann and features a memorable opening title sequence by graphic designer Saul Bass. This film is generally cited as the first to feature extended use of kinetic typography in its opening credits.While having lunch at the Plaza Hotel in New York, advertising executive Roger O. Thornhill has the bad luck to call for a messenger just as a page goes out for a 'George Kaplan.' From that moment, Thornhill finds that he has stepped into a nightmare -- he is quietly abducted by a pair of armed men out of the hotel's famous Oak Room and transported to a Long Island estate; there, he is interrogated by a mysterious man who, believing that Roger is George Kaplan, demands to know what he knows about his business and how he has come to acquire this knowledge. Roger, who knows nothing about who any of these people are, can do nothing but deny that he is Kaplan or that he knows what they're talking about. Finally, his captors force a bottle of bourbon into Roger and put him behind the wheel of a car on a dangerous downhill stretch. Through sheer luck and the intervention of a police patrol car and its driver (John Beradino), Roger survives the ride and evades his captors, and is booked for drunk driving. He's unable to persuade the court, the county detectives, or even his own mother of the truth of his story, however -- Thornhill returns with them to the mansion where he was held, only to find any incriminating evidence cleaned up and to learn that the owner of the house is a diplomat, Lester Townsend, assigned to the United Nations. He backtracks to the hotel to find the room of the real George Kaplan, only to discover that no one at the hotel has ever actually seen the man. With his kidnappers once again pursuing him, Thornhill decides to confront Townsend at the United Nations, only to discover that he knows nothing of the events on Long Island, or his house being occupied -- but before he can learn more, Townsend gets a knife in his back in full view of 50 witnesses who believe that Roger did it. Now on the run from a murder charge, complete with a photograph of him holding the weapon plastered on the front page of every newspaper in the country, Thornhill tries to escape via train -- there he meets the coolly beautiful Eve Kendall, who twice hides him from the police, once spontaneously and a second time in a more calculated rendezvous in her compartment that gets the two of them together romantically, at least for the night. By the next day, he's off following a clue to a remote rural highway, where he is attacked by an armed crop-dusting plane, one of the most famous scenes in Hitchcock's entire film output. Thornhill barely survives, but he does manage to learn that his mysterious tormentor/interrogator is named Phillip Vandamm, and that he goes under the cover of being an art dealer and importer/exporter, and that Eve is in bed with him in every sense of the phrase -- or is she?This is a great film, and certainly one of the most entertaining movies ever made, directed by Alfred Hitchcock at his peak.It has all the classic elements of a Hitchcock film - well timed suspense, an overall mystery, a compelling cast and some brilliantly conceived scenes.Finally,it has stood the test of time as a gripping, suspenseful, and visually iconic, this late-period Hitchcock classic laid the groundwork for countless action thrillers to follow for many years to come.",10,1,3,27 February 2012
Coriolanus," Fiennes Excels In His Directorial Debut
","Coriolanus is a British film adaptation of Shakespeare's tragedy Coriolanus that star Ralph Fiennes and Gerard Butler together with Vanessa Redgrave, Brian Cox, Jessica Chastain and Paul Jesson. This movie serves as the directorial debut of Fiennes. Caius Martius 'Coriolanus', a revered and feared Roman General is at odds with the city of Rome and his fellow citizens. Pushed by his controlling and ambitious mother Volumnia to seek the exalted and powerful position of Consul, he is loath to ingratiate himself with the masses whose votes he needs in order to secure the office. When the public refuses to support him, Coriolanus's anger prompts a riot that culminates in his expulsion from Rome. The banished hero then allies himself with his sworn enemy Tullus Aufidius to take his revenge on the city. This film is Shakespeare done right. Ralph Fiennes takes a play about Roman war and hubris and turns it into a violently charismatic picture. There something like poetry in this film, some truth that cannot be apprehended by staring hard at the screen, but drifts softly as a dandelion spore through the burned- out ruins of some sacked and dusty 'Rome.' it's a challenging, and even exciting, piece of cinema that's sure to inspire much love from Shakespeare enthusiasts.",10,1,5,1 April 2013

It is the second sequel to The Terminator.Set ten years after the events of 1991's Terminator 2: Judgement Day, the screenplay finds Connor living on the streets as a common laborer.

Doctor Zhivago," An Epic Romance And Historical Drama
","Doctor Zhivago is an epic romance and historical drama that stars Omar Sharif and Julie Christie together with Geraldine Chaplin,Rod Steiger,Alec Guinness and Tom Courtenay. It is loosely based on the famous novel of the same name by Boris Pasternak and it has remained popular for decades. It was directed by David Lean.Doctor Zhivago covers the years prior to, during, and after the Russian Revolution, as seen through the eyes of poet/physician Yuri Zhivago. In the tradition of Russian novels, a multitude of characters and subplots intertwine within the film's length of more than 3 hours. Zhivago is married to Tonya, but carries on an affair with Lara, who has been raped by ruthless politician Komarovsky. Meanwhile, Zhivago's half-brother Yevgraf and the mysterious, revenge-seeking Strelnikoff represent the 'good' and 'bad' elements of the Bolshevik revolution. This epic, sweeping romance, told in flashback, captures the lushness of Moscow before the war and the violent social upheaval that followed. David Lean focused all his talent as an epic-maker on Boris Pasternak's sweeping novel about a doctor-poet in revolutionary Russia. The results may sometimes veer toward soap opera, especially with the screen frequently filled with adoring close-ups of the leads - Omar Sharif and Julie Christie - but Lean's gift for cramming the screen with spectacle is not to be denied. The streets of Moscow, the snowy steppes of Russia, the house in the country taken over by ice - these are re-created with his unerring sense of grandness.It is so lush and so long that it becomes an irresistible wallow, even when logic suffers.Overall,this may not be the best of his epics, but it is still brilliantly photographed and sweepingly romantic.",10,2,2,25 September 2012
The Shining," The Greatest American Horror Film Ever Made
","The Shining is a psychological horror film produced and directed by Stanley Kubrick.It stars Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, and Danny Lloyd. The movie involves a writer, Jack Torrance,who takes a job as an off-season caretaker at an isolated hotel called Overlook Hotel.His young son,Danny possesses psychic abilities and is able to see things from the past and future,such as the ghosts who inhabit the hotel. Soon after settling in,the family is trapped in the hotel by a snowstorm, and Jack gradually becomes influenced by a supernatural presence as he descends into madness and attempts to murder his wife and son.The film was also written by Kubrick together with Diane Johnson and it was based on the novel of the same title written by Stephen King.Kubrick's eerie adaptation of King's horror novel starts when frustrated writer, Jack Torrance takes a job as the winter caretaker at the opulently ominous, mountain-locked Overlook Hotel so that he can write in peace with wife Wendy and son Danny in tow. Before the Overlook is vacated for the Torrances, the manager informs Jack that a previous caretaker went crazy and slaughtered his family. Jack thinks it's no problem, but Danny's 'shining' hints otherwise. Settling into their routine, Danny cruises through the empty corridors on his Big Wheel and plays in the topiary maze with Wendy, while Jack sets up shop in a cavernous lounge with strict orders not to be disturbed. Danny's alter ego, 'Tony,' however, starts warning of 'redrum' or murder spelled backwards as Danny is plagued by more blood-soaked visions of the past, and a blocked Jack starts visiting the hotel bar for a few visions of his own. Frightened by her husband's behavior and Danny's visit to the forbidding Room 237, Wendy soon discovers what Jack has really been doing in his study all day, and what the hotel has done to Jack.Kubrick's film is considered a horror film but it is more about madness especially when taking into consideration the character of Jack Torrance.Aside from madness,it also tackles psychic abilities that a person may have just like Jack's son,Danny.Also,it is definitely one of the best films ever made and DEFINITELY the GREATEST American HORROR FILM ever produced.Kubrick does put into the screen an engaging story and interesting adaptation that will put the viewer in the edge of their seats as the events transpire on screen.It was nominated for two Razzie back on the year it was released only later on to realize that the movie was simply ahead of its time. The performances of the cast are simply outstanding.Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Jack Torrance is definitely over-the-top to a point that it elevates the movie to higher levels.While Shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyd provide great talent to match Nicholson's performance.Added to that,the soundtrack of the film especially those composed by BÃ©la BartÃ³k even raises the film into greater heights.Overall,The Shining ranks among the classics and the great films ever made of all-time.",10,2,5,8 November 2011

Her problems aren't helped by her best friend Angela, an aspiring model who is quite beautiful and believes that that alone makes her a worthwhile person.

Judgment at Nuremberg," A Landmark Achievement On Holocaust Films
","Judgment at Nuremberg is a drama film dealing with the Holocaust and the Post-World War II Nuremberg Trials. It was written by Abby Mann, directed by Stanley Kramer, and starred Spencer Tracy, Burt Lancaster, Richard Widmark, Maximilian Schell, Werner Klemperer, Marlene Dietrich, Judy Garland, William Shatner and Montgomery Clift. It was among the first films to be made about the Holocaust.After the end of World War II, the world gradually became aware of the full extent of the war crimes perpetrated by the Third Reich. In 1948, a series of trials were held in Nuremberg, Germany, by an international tribunal, headed by American legal and military officials, with the intent of bringing to justice those guilty of crimes against humanity. However, by that time most of the major figures of the Nazi regime were either dead or long missing, and in the resulting legal proceedings American judges often found themselves confronting the question of how much responsibility someone held who had 'just followed orders.' Judgment at Nuremberg is a dramatized version of the proceedings at one of these trials, in which Judge Dan Haywood (Spencer Tracy) is overseeing the trials of four German judges -- most notably Dr. Ernst Janning and Emil Hahn -- accused of knowingly sentencing innocent men to death in collusion with the Nazis. Representing the defense is attorney Hans Rolfe (Maximilian Schell), while prosecuting the accused is U.S. Col. Tad Lawson. As the trial goes on, both the visiting Americans and their reluctant German hosts often find themselves facing the legacy of the war, and how both of their nations have been irrevocably changed by it. A typical Stanley Kramer's film: Serious (even pompous) and humanist, but essentially middlebrow, courtroom drama that while well-acted is too verbose and fearful of taking sides in the controversy over who's to blame for the Nazi atrocities.Aside from that,it could also be considered a rare cinematic exploration of the messy, difficult aftermath of evaluating culpability, not only for the Nazi masterminds, but also for innumerable officials and functionaries.It is definitely absorbing from beginning to end with great acting from Tracy,who delivers a performance of great intelligence and intuition.Although there are there are no surprises in the direction, and Abby Mann's screenplay plays the expected tunes, there's enough conviction on display to reward a patient spectator.A must-see for people who love great films.",10,1,2,29 February 2012

The T-1000, however, has the ability to morph itself into any shape it desires, allowing it chameleon-like powers and near indestructibility. The T-800 saves John's life and helps break Sarah out of the institution.

There, they attempt to convince inventor Miles Dyson to help them stop the future from ever occurring by destroying his work. Dyson sacrifices himself in an explosion to save the world, leading to a final showdown between the two Terminators at a steel foundry.A sequel to the sci-fi action thriller that made him and star Arnold Schwarzenegger A-list Hollywood names, writer/director James Cameron upped the ante with this follow-up by employing a more sweeping storyline and cutting-edge special effects.The film excelled in many technical categories for its groundbreaking effects for which it won four Oscars.It is the ultimate is a state-of-the-art action movie, all right: It gets you thinking that the most reasonable thing might just have been to blow everyone away.",10,3,4,27 February 2012

Along the way Willard encounters different personalities such as napalm and Wagner fan Col. Kilgore, draftees who prefer to surf and do drugs, a USO Playboy Bunny show turned into a riot by the raucous soldiers, and a jumpy photographer telling wild, reverent tales about Kurtz. By the time Willard sees the heads mounted on stakes near Kurtz's compound, he knows Kurtz has gone over the deep end, but it is uncertain whether Willard himself now agrees with Kurtz's insane dictum to 'Drop the Bomb. Exterminate them all.'This film is the greatest Vietnam War film ever made especially when it presented the concept that war is hell and madness.Also,it only tells the viewer that nobody is right and only dead bodies are the ones left.Aside from dead bodies,it also portrays how men are physically and psychologically decapitated by it.Apart from the theme and the message presented,the film also has a great cast that delivers a powerful performance and it rises to the occasion of elevating the movie to one of the best films ever made.Marlon Brando as usual delivers in his role that as always proves that he is the best actor that ever lived in the world.While Martin Sheen proves credible as the lead protagonist.The actors involved makes it compelling that it shocks the audience to the fullest about the realism brought about by destruction of war and Coppola's direction does that through audio and visual means.And most of all,this is a must-see film not for everyone to fully realize that nothing good is brought about by war.In summary,Apocalypse Now is truly a masterpiece.",10,3,4,3 November 2011

When the kindly inventor dies, however, Edward is left lonely and cursed with some very heavy metal for hands. He is eventually taken in by Peg Boggs, an Avon lady who takes pity on him after seeing his bleak existence. Edward, in spite of his inherent ability to slay anyone he comes across, is a gentle soul whose only wish is to be loved. His impromptu family has, at best, a limited understanding of Edward, but he finds himself drawn to Peg's weary but sympathetic daughter, Kim, who is dating Jim, the neighborhood bully. Meanwhile, Edward finds himself a local celebrity after the town realizes that his talents include creative hedge trimming and an unrivaled ability to cut hair.

Rocky IV," Cold War,Patriotism And Revenge
","The fourth installment of Rocky provides unusual themes from the first three films such as the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union,American patriotism and revenge towards the death of a friend.This time around,star/writer/director Sylvester Stallone puts them all together in Rocky IV.The movie stars Stallone together with Talia Shire,Burt Young,Carl Weathers,Tony Burton - all whom have reprise their roles,together with Dolph Lundgren as Rocky's new opponent,Ivan Drago and Brigette Nielsen as Drago's wife.Rocky IV has the story this time with Rocky Balboa,the heavyweight champion of the world.Also,he is now a good friend of his one-time nemesis, Apollo Creed.Rocky Balboa plans to retire from boxing after regaining his title from Clubber Lang.Motivated by patriotism and an innate desire to prove himself,Creed challenges Ivan Drago,an unknown amateur boxer from the Soviet Union who wants to make a bid to enter professional boxing to an exhibition bout. During the ensuing press conference, Apollo is accused of being a 'has been' by Drago's manager. Livid, Apollo loses his temper, and a mêlée ensues. It is broken up and Apollo leaves the press conference abruptly vowing to 'finish this in the ring'.Unfortunately,Apollo Creed is brutally slaughtered in the boxing ring during a lop-sided exhibition match against the Russian,an event that Rocky takes personally. Vowing revenge against Drago in the name of Creed and the United States, Rocky is invited to the Soviet Union for a match-up and hires Creed's former manager to get him in shape. While Drago trains using the latest technology,Rocky's ascetic preparations are a low-key affair of carrying logs up hills through knee-deep Russian snow.As everyone knew,the end of the movie has Rocky winning the match.I consider Rocky IV definitely is considered has the most action-packed as compared to the first three films.Aside from that,it is enjoyable and entertaining in the sense the American patriotism was brought into the picture as one of its themes.Unfortunately,it has become shallow just and has leveled itself with Rambo,the other movie franchise of Stallone.It was also in this movie wherein Rocky has lost its punch and character development were set aside especially when a robot-like opponent was presented and revenge for a death of a friend was brought into the story.Despite of its commercial success at the box office,I consider it the second worst Rocky installments behind Rocky,Rocky Balboa,Rocky II and Rocky III in that order.",7,1,1,23 October 2011

A petty thief in strife- torn '70s Belfast, Gerry's main interests are getting drunk and partying, much to the dismay of his quiet, frail father Giuseppe. When Gerry angers the IRA, his father sends him to England, where his antics land him in the wrong place at the wrong time. Innocent, but forced to confess to a savage terrorist bombing, he is sentenced to life imprisonment as one of the 'Guildford Four.' An innocent Giuseppe is also arrested and jailed, and while behind bars, Gerry slowly learns that his father's seeming weakness masks an unmatched inner strength and wisdom. Working with a fiercely dedicated lawyer, Gerry determines to prove his innocence, clear his father's name and expose the truth behind one of the most shameful legal events in recent history.Miscarried justice often provides the vehicle for emotionally wrenching drama and histrionic fireworks, and such is the case in spades with In the Name of the Father.The brilliance of Jim Sheridan's motion picture is that we come to view every event from the perspective of how it impacts on the relationship between Gerry and his father, in whose name the final struggle is fought.In addition to that,Letter-perfect performances from Day-Lewis and Postlethwaite that the acting's so good it frequently transcends the simplicity of the script and do a lot more than a dozen editorials to make an unforgettable point about the miscarriage of justice.",10,1,2,23 October 2012

The film was written and directed by Judd Apatow and co-written by its lead star, Steve Carell, though the film itself features a great deal of improvised dialogue.It also stars Paul Rudd,Seth Rogen,Catherine Keener and Romany Malco.Andy Stitzer (Carell) is a cheerfully geeky guy who is settling into middle age with his large collection of comic books, action figures, and collectible models. Andy works in an electronics store, and seems reasonably happy with his life. However, one day his friends and co- workers David (Rudd), Jay (Malco), and Cal (Rogen) discover that Andy has a secret -- due to his rather severe jitters around women, Andy is still a virgin. Andy's pals are appalled at this state of affairs, and set out to find a woman who'd be willing to get horizontal with him. After a number of disastrous dates, everyone thinks Andy has finally struck gold when he meets Trish (Keener), an attractive single mother who takes an immediate liking to him. What the other guys don't know is that Trish has just gotten out of a bad relationship, and has informed Andy she isn't ready to be intimate with him just yet.Although The 40 Year Old Virgin could be categorized as a sex comedy,it is a romantic drama film as well that the audience could empathize with the main character,Andy.The movie is insightful in the sense that we get to know what's keeping him from losing his virginity and at the same time realize what development and maturity he needs to undergo in order to overcome that.And also,there is his romantic interest in Trish,who the viewer expects to help Andy lose his virginity.But instead of turning into dirty and crude humor,the movie instead focuses on love and middle-age romantic relationship between the two of them.What's also great about the movie is that it is far from offensive.That is one big achievement that the writers have achieved in this film.The performances of the film are spectacular especially Steve Carrell and Catherine Keener.Both have an undeniable chemistry on screen.Also,they make us care for their characters.Carrell is also on top of his game as a comedic actor.Overall,here is one sex comedy that could probably be classified as one of the ever best released.Or better yet,a classic that adult audience will surely enjoy.",10,1,3,13 September 2012
Face_Off," Face/Off Is Must-See
","Face/Off is an action thriller film directed by John Woo.It features Nicolas Cage and John Travolta together with Joan Allen,Alessandro Nivola,Gina Gershon,Dominique Swain,Nick Cassavetes,Harve Presnell,Colm Feore and C. C. H. Pounder. The two both play an FBI agent and a terrorist, sworn enemies who assume the physical appearance of one another.It exemplifies Woo's signature gun fu and heroic bloodshed action sequences, and has Travolta and Cage each playing two personalities. Sean Archer, an FBI agent obsessed with capturing Castor Troy, a criminal genius who years before killed Archer's son while trying to assassinate the agent. Archer's single-minded pursuit of Troy has caused serious harm to his marriage, but Archer thinks the light may have appeared at the end of the tunnel when a seriously wounded Troy is captured in a bloody shootout. However, it turns out that Troy has planted a time bomb, with a biological payload that could destroy the entire city of Los Angeles and Troy isn't about to say where it is. The only other person who knows the bomb's location is Troy's brother, Pollux, who is no more helpful than Castor. FBI scientists hatch a plan: they have developed an experimental surgery which would allow them to graft Troy's face temporarily on Archer's head and allow him to question Pollux as if he were his brother. But after Archer has taken Troy's face, Troy regains consciousness and forces the doctors to give him Archer's face. Now the criminal mastermind has the FBI at his disposal, and the lawman is underground with few places to turn. Travolta vamps Cage's tics and flamboyant excess with the grace of a dancer after his transformation from cop to criminal, while Cage plays the sullen, bottled-up agent excruciatingly trapped behind the face of the man who killed his son. His attempts to live up to the terrorist's reputation become cathartic explosions of violence that both thrill and terrify him. This is merely icing on the cake for action fans, the dramatic backbone for some of the most visceral action thrills ever. Woo fills the screen with one show-stopping set piece after another, bringing a poetic grace to the action freak out with sweeping camera-work and sophisticated editing. This marriage of melodrama and mayhem ups the ante from cops-and-robbers clichés to a conflict of near-mythic levels.This brutal, stunningly choreographed spectacle weaves together lyrical beauty, blasphemy, sadistic cruelty and grotesque sentimentality with breathtakingly smooth assurance.",10,1,1,11 October 2012

Spider-Man," One Of The Best Superhero Movie
","Spiderman is a superhero film that is based on the fictional Marvel Comics character Spiderman. The film stars Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker, a high-school student who turns to crime fighting after developing spider-like powers. Spider-Man also stars Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn, Kirsten Dunst as Peter's love interest Mary-Jane Watson, and James Franco as his best friend Harry Osborn.After incorporating elements of comic book style and design into many of his films, director Sam Raimi helms this straight-ahead, big-budget comic book adaptation, which also marks acclaimed young actor Tobey Maguire's first dip into live-action blockbuster film-making. Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris co-star to play key supporting roles.Spiderman follows the template of the original Stan Lee/Steve Ditko source material, with hero Peter Parker an orphaned, intellectual teen loner living in Queens with his aunt and uncle, and dreaming of the girl next door, Mary Jane. On a field trip to a Columbia University lab, Peter is bitten by a genetically altered spider and overnight he gains superhuman strength, agility, and perception. At first, Peter uses his powers for material gain, winning a wrestling match with a purportedly lucrative prize. But when Peter apathetically fails to stop a burglar from robbing the wrestling arena, a tragedy follows that compels him to devote his powers to fighting crime as the superhero Spiderman. When he's not busy fighting crime in a spider suit, Peter moves into an apartment with his best friend, Harry, and begins work as a photographer at the Daily Bugle. Meanwhile, his do-gooder alter ego finds a nemesis in the form of the Green Goblin, a super-powered, megalomaniacal villain who happens to be the alter ego of Harry's father, weapons-manufacturing mogul Norman Osborn. Spiderman provide a good dose of web-swinging fun.Also,it also has a heart.Credit that to the combined charms of director Sam Raimi and star Tobey Maguire. Added to that,it captures the high-energy, pulpy effervescence of Marvel when it was young and feisty. Whatever imperfections the film picks up along the way, they practically demand to be hand-waved aside as it effectively takes time between exhilarating digital effects to develop character and motivation. Colorful, energetic and well-cast,it is a good-quality, highly-entertaining action movie.",10,2,3,15 October 2012

The Machinist," It Does Not Follow Hollywood Conventions
","The Machinist is a psychological thriller film that stars Christian Bale together with Jennifer Jason Leigh, John Sharian, Aitana Sánchez-Gijón and Michael Ironside.It was written by Scott Kosar and directed by Brad Anderson.Trevor Reznik is a factory lathe operator who has developed a serious case of insomnia. Lack of sleep has already started to wear down on his brain and his body. When he's involved in an accident at work, his co- workers turn against him. He starts to find strange notes in his apartment and see people that apparently aren't there.Then he struggles to assemble the clues of his psychological conundrum. With a friendly hooker and airport waitress as his only stable links to sanity,he reaches critical mass and seems ready to implode just as secrets are revealed as the film progresses.This is worth watching due to the performance of Christian Bale,who literally threw himself into the title role with such devotion that he shed an alarming 63 pounds and gave life into playing Trevor Reznik.Also,it isn't your typical Hollywood film as the viewer has to watch this psychological thriller with full attention, follow along, and decipher for themselves events that happen in the plot.And finally,it is both interesting and entertaining despite being not really a 'likable' picture.",8,1,1,28 September 2012
The Intouchables," An Odd Friendship
","The Intouchables is a French film that is about an irreverent, uplifting comedy about friendship, trust and human possibility.A rich quadriplegic, living in a mansion in Paris, requires a live-in carer. A young offender turns up for an interview, but he is not really looking to get the job. However, to his surprise, he is hired. The two men then develop a close friendship.It features François Cluzet and Omar Sy; and it was directed by Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano. There are countless magical moments worth recounting - many with humor and involving the clash of the classes - it is not surprising that the film has been a runaway hit in France and elsewhere in Europe.Capturing the unspoken shorthand, the adventurousness and the humor essential to enduring friendships makes the The Intouchables must see as it handles its potentially prickly subject matter with kid gloves.Added to that, it gets by thanks to its strong cast and some remarkably sensitive direction.",10,3,6,20 October 2012
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," A Harry Potter Classic
","In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry, Ron and Hermione, now teenagers, return for their third year at Hogwarts, where they are forced to face escaped prisoner, Sirius Black, who poses a great threat to Harry. This movie features Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, alongside Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Harry's best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. This fantasy film directed by Alfonso Cuarón is based on the novel of the same title by J. K. Rowling. It is the third installment in the Harry Potter film series, written by Steve Kloves and produced by Chris Columbus, David Heyman and Mark Radcliffe. The story follows Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts as he is informed that a prisoner named Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban and wants to murder him. It is somewhat of a departure from its predecessors, and particularly beloved among fans for its surprise ending. Prisoner of Azkaban also marks the introduction of Sirius Black,portrayed by Gary Oldman who has escaped from the title prison after 12 years of incarceration.Believed to have been the right-hand-man of the dark wizard Voldemort, whom Harry mysteriously rendered powerless during his infancy, some of those closest to Harry suspect Black has returned to exact revenge on the boy who defeated his master. Upon his return to school, however, Harry is relatively unconcerned with Black. Run by Albus Dumbledore who is widely regarded as the most powerful wizard of the age as Hogwarts is renowned for its safety. Harry's nonchalance eventually turns to blind rage after accidentally learning the first of Black's many secrets during a field trip to a neighboring village. Of course, a loose serial killer is only one of the problems plaguing the bespectacled wizard's third year back at school such as the soul-sucking guards of Azkaban prison have been employed at Hogwarts to protect the students, but their mere presence sends Harry into crippling fainting spells. With the help of his friends Ron and Hermione, and Defense Against the Dark Arts professor Remus Lupin, Harry struggles to thwart the Dementors, find Sirius Black, and uncover the mysteries of the night that left him orphaned.Some movie-loving wizards must have cast a magic spell on Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, because it's another grand slam for the Harry Potter franchise.Under the assured direction of Alfonso Cuaron, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban triumphantly strikes a delicate balance between technical wizardry and complex storytelling. Demonstrating remarkable versatility after the art-house success of Y Tu Mamá También, Cuarón proves a perfect choice to guide Harry and his friends into treacherous puberty as the now 13-year-old students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry face a new and daunting challenge: Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban prison, and for reasons yet unknown, he's after Harry in a bid for revenge. This dark and dangerous mystery drives the action.The familiar Hogwarts staff returns in fine form and even Julie Christie joins this prestigious production for a brief but welcome cameo. Technically dazzling, fast-paced, and chock-full of Rowling's boundless imagination, The Prisoner of Azkaban is a Harry Potter-movie classic that deserves the highest rating.",10,1,2,22 October 2012
Ratatouille," Another Excellent Pixar Animated Film
","Ratatouille is a computer-animated comedy produced by Pixar Animation Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. It is the eighth film produced by Pixar, and was directed by Brad Bird. The title refers to a French dish which is served in the film, and is also a play on words about the species of the main character. The film stars the voices of Patton Oswalt as Remy, an anthropomorphic rat who is interested in cooking; Lou Romano as Linguini, a young garbage boy who befriends Remy; Ian Holm as Skinner, the head chef of Auguste Gusteau's restaurant; Janeane Garofalo as Colette, a rôtisseur at Gusteau's restaurant; Peter O'Toole as Anton Ego, a restaurant critic; Brian Dennehy as Django, Remy's father and leader of his clan; Peter Sohn as Emile, Remy's brother; Brad Garrett as Auguste Gusteau, a recently deceased chef; and Will Arnett as Horst, the sous-chef at Gusteau's restaurant. The plot follows Remy, who dreams of becoming a chef and tries to achieve his goal by forming an alliance with a Parisian restaurant's garbage boy.A said scrawny rat named Remy finds his dreams of culinary superstardom stirring up sizable controversy in the kitchen of a fine French restaurant in director Brad Bird's madcap computer-animated comedy. It's hard being a rat with culinary aspirations, but Remy is convinced he has what it takes to break the stereotypes and follow in the footsteps of star chef Auguste Gusteau. As fate would have it, Remy is currently situated in the sewers directly beneath Gusteau's elegant restaurant. Soon Remy teams up with a young chef with little talent named Linguini. Together they are able to create some fabulous dishes, but they live in fear that someone will discover their secret and object strenuously to a rat being in a kitchen. When Remy's passion for cooking turns the haughty world of French cuisine upside down, the rat who would be king of the kitchen learns important lessons about life, friends, and family while questioning whether he should pursue his culinary calling or simply go back underground and return to his life as a sewer rat. One key point: if you can get over the natural gag reflex of seeing hundreds of rodents swarming over a restaurant kitchen, you will be free to enjoy the glory of Ratatouille. Our hero is Remy, a rat who rises from his humble beginnings to become head chef at a Paris restaurant. How this happens is the stuff of Pixar magic, that ineffable blend of headlong comedy, seamless technology, and wonder.As classically as 'Babe',it turns animal-kingdom expectations on their ear for a unique, generous and gleeful gastronomic masterpiece that knows it's not much fun to look out, or cook, only for yourself.Director Brad Bird doesn't quite keep all his spinning plates in the air, but the gags are great and the animation amazingly expressive.Added to that,it's hard to complain about a movie that cooks up such bountiful pleasure.It is surely a must-see.",10,1,3,21 October 2012
Aliens," Bigger, Faster And Scarier
","Aliens is a science fiction action film directed by James Cameron and starring Sigourney Weaver, Carrie Henn, Michael Biehn, Lance Henriksen, William Hope, and Bill Paxton. A sequel to the 1979 film Alien, Aliens follows Weaver's character Ellen Ripley as she returns to the planet where her crew encountered the hostile Alien creature, this time accompanied by a unit of Colonial Marines.Big-budget special effects, swiftly paced action, and a distinct feminist subtext from writer/director James Cameron turned what should have been a by-the- numbers sci-fi sequel into both a blockbuster and a seven-time Oscar nominee.Weaver returns as Ellen Ripley, the last surviving crew member of a corporate spaceship destroyed after an attack by a vicious, virtually unbeatable alien life form. Adrift in space for half a century, Ripley grapples with depression until she's informed by her company's representative, Carter Burke that the planet where her crew discovered the alien has since been settled by colonists. Contact with the colony has suddenly been lost, and a detachment of colonial marines is being sent to investigate. Invited along as an adviser, Ripley predicts disaster, and sure enough, the aliens have infested the colony, leaving a sole survivor, the young girl Newt. With the soldiers picked off one by one, a final all-female showdown brews between the alien queen and Ripley, who's become a surrogate mother to Newt. It's interesting that the film, a sequel to Ridley Scott's atmospheric horror-film-in-space, is generally regarded as an action movie. Go through it, and you'll realize the character and dialogue scenes far outweigh the kablooey stuff.Also,the sequel is sequel is bigger, faster, scarier.And most of all,while Alien was a marvel of slow-building, atmospheric tension, Aliens packs a much more visceral punch, and features a typically strong performance from Sigourney Weaver.",10,2,5,2 March 2012
Dallas Buyers Club," Matthew McConaughey's Career Best Performance
","I have witness many Matthew McConaughey films such as A Time To Kill,How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days,Failure to Launch and Fool's Gold.Never have I been convinced that he has great acting ability and that he relied mainly on his good looks to make a name in Hollywood until I have seen Dallas Buyers Club.In it,McConaughey has to lose 47 pounds and has to keep away with his great looks as well as his charisma as he needs to look skinny and gaunt when he portrays a person who contracted HIV and would soon be dying of AIDS in Ron Woodroof.Basically,there is nothing left for him except to show the viewer that he indeed can carry a movie using his acting ability alone rather than his charismatic and muscular looks.And he indeed succeeded.The story written by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack involves about Ron Woodroof,who tried to treat himself with unapproved pharmaceutical drugs without F.D.A. approval and distributed them to his fellow people who contracted H.I.V. virus and who are soon dying of A.I.D.S. during the 1980's when knowledge about the disease and how to combat it are lacking. Together,they formed the 'Dallas Buyers Club'. As mentioned,McConaughey provided a great character performance which could probably be considered his career best.This alone could be a reason to merit an excellent rating and great reason to watch the film.In addition to that,it is also a relevant film about the A.I.D.S. epidemic as well as the A.I.D.S. and H.I.V. virus that does not involve queers and gays alone.Finally,it provides the viewer lots of knowledge about the subject matter both in the past and the present about it.",10,1,1,4 July 2015
The Exorcist," One Of The Scariest Films Of All Time
","The Exorcist is a horror film directed by William Friedkin and that is adapted by William Peter Blatty from his novel of the same title which is inspired by the 1949 exorcism case of Roland Doe that deals with the demonic possession of a young girl and her mother's desperate attempts to win back her daughter through an exorcism conducted by two priests.This happens to be the last known Catholic-sanctioned exorcism in the United States. The film features Ellen Burstyn, Max von Sydow, Jason Miller, Lee J. Cobb, Linda Blair, and Mercedes McCambridge.The screenplay is about a little girl named Regan. Suddenly prone to fits and bizarre behavior, Regan proves quite a handful for her actress- mother, Chris MacNeil. When Regan gets completely out of hand, Chris calls in young priest Father Karras, who becomes convinced that the girl is possessed by the Devil and that they must call in an exorcist: namely, Father Merrin. His foe proves to be no run-of-the-mill demon, and both the priest and the girl suffer numerous horrors during their struggles. The film rides its supernatural theme to magical effect, with remarkable special effects and an eerie atmosphere, resulting in one of the scariest films of all time and also if are, among other things, opportunities for escapism, then it is one of the most powerful ever made.This notorious battle between good and evil is both a hysteric scream and an intentional as well as unintentional hoot.",10,2,4,20 October 2012
Gandhi," A Great Experience
","Gandhi is a biographical film based on the life of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who led the nonviolent resistance movement against British colonial rule in India during the first half of the 20th century. The film was directed and produced by Sir Richard Attenborough and stars Ben Kingsley in the title role together with Candice Bergen,Edward Fox,John Gielgud,Trevor Howard and John Mills.It was Attenborough's lifelong dream to bring the life story of the Indian political and spiritual leader to the screen. When it finally reached fruition, the 188-minute, Oscar-winning film was one of the most exhaustively thorough biopics ever made.The film begins in the early part of the 20th century, when Mohandas K. Gandhi, a British-trained lawyer, forsakes all worldly possessions to take up the cause of Indian independence. Faced with armed resistance from the British government, he adopts a policy of 'passive resistance,' endeavoring to win freedom for his people without resorting to bloodshed. In playing Gandhi, an actor must be less concerned with physical verisimilitude than with spiritual presence.But Kingsley is nothing short of astonishing.His performance is amazing, particularly in the way he ages across the five decades which the film depicts.But inspite of his great performance,it is too conventional in illuminating the person and it can be exhausting to the viewer.But nevertheless,it is a remarkable experience that will definitely entertain the viewer.",10,1,3,16 September 2012
American History X," Provocative Film On Racism
","Tony Kaye made his feature directorial debut with this dramatic exploration into the roots of race hatred in America in this film entitled American History X.It tells the story of two brothers, Derek Vinyard and Daniel 'Danny' Vinyard of Venice Beach in Los Angeles, California. Both are intelligent and charismatic students. Their father, a firefighter, is murdered by a black drug dealer while trying to extinguish a fire in a South Central neighborhood of Los Angeles, and Derek is drawn into the neo-Nazi movement. Derek brutally kills two black gang members whom he catches in the act of breaking into the truck left to him by his father, and is sentenced to three years in prison for voluntary manslaughter. The story shows how Danny is influenced by his older brother's actions and ideology and how Derek, now radically changed by his experience in incarceration, which includes violent rape by white inmates, tries to prevent his brother from going down the same path as he did. The film is told in the style of nonlinear narrative. David McKenna scripted the film and shooting took place in Los Angeles, California.A well-made, well-acted and often violent film that offers a compelling portrait of redemption and the destructive nature of racism.It is a violent film on a weighty topic.It is brutally honest with its characters, actions, and ideas compelling the viewer to look further and become involved.This jolting film will draw serious-minded upscale viewers interested in cutting-edge fare and the latest outstanding performance by Edward Norton,an amazing actor and a hot-dog whose delight in transformation is infectious.This is a must-see not only for Norton's performance but on how it is interesting and sometimes compelling that it contains more actual provocative thought than any American film on race.",10,1,2,14 January 2012

The film tells the story of Chihiro Ogino, a sullen ten-year-old girl who, while moving to a new neighborhood, becomes trapped in an alternate reality that is inhabited by spirits and monsters.After her parents are transformed into pigs by the witch Yubaba, Chihiro takes a job working in Yubaba's bathhouse to find a way to free herself and her parents and escape back to the human world.Master animation director Hayao Miyazaki follows up on his record-breaking 1997 opus Princess Mononoke with this surreal Alice in Wonderland-like tale about a lost little girl.

After her mother and father help themselves to some tasty purloined morsels, they turn into giant pigs. Chihiro understandably freaks out and flees. She learns that this very weird place, where all sorts of bizarre gods and monsters reside, is a holiday resort for the supernatural after their exhausting tour of duty in the human world.

If she forgets her real name, Haku tells her, then she will never be permitted to leave.Miyazaki's nonstop images are so stunning, and his imagination so vivid, that the only possible complaint you could have about Spirited Away is that there is no rest period, no timeout.Also,it was the most deeply and mysteriously satisfying animated feature to come along in ages for it was is a dazzling, enchanting, and gorgeously drawn fairy tale that will leave viewers a little more curious and fascinated by our world.",10,2,4,29 February 2012
Pearl Harbor," Great Special Effects But Weak Storytelling
","Pearl Harbor is a war film that mixes action and romantic drama elements.It features a large ensemble cast, including Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, Alec Baldwin, Jon Voight, Kate Beckinsale, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Dan Aykroyd, Colm Feore, Mako, Tom Sizemore, Jaime King and Jennifer Garner.It is a dramatic re-imagining of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.The film was written by Randall Wallace and directed by Michael Bay.When the Japanese military launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on that fateful day in December of 1941, the United States was caught completely off guard by the formidable force of 350 heavily armed aircraft and leading to one of the most tragic events in U.S. military history. How could the military base not have known about such a massive attack? Was it due to the amazing strategy of the Japanese pilots, or did their fighters just hit the right place at the most unexpected and vulnerable time.Pearl Harbor tries to be the Titanic of war movies, but it's just a tedious romance filled with laughably bad dialogue. For the first 90 minutes of the movie, Affleck and Beckinsale find a nice, appealing chemistry that plays on his strengths as a movie star and hers as a serious actress as he gives her glamour, she gives him smarts. Their truncated romance - the beginning of which is told in flashback so we can get right to the point where he has to leave her to go to England - works, thanks to their charm. They're no Kate and Leo from Titanic but they're pretty darn adorable in their own right. Hartnett, as the not entirely unwelcome third wheel, squints bravely but makes only a slight dent in the film. Everyone else in Pearl Harbor - from Cuba Gooding Jr.'s brave navy seaman to Jon Voight's able impersonation of FDR - is pretty much a glorified walk-on, taking a backseat to the pyrotechnics and action sequences that keep the three-hour film in fairly constant motion. But when that action does take hold, Pearl Harbor is quite a thrilling ride.The 40 minute action sequence is spectacular though.It's just a bit unfortunate that such an incredible, noble story, one which turned a nation around and galvanized a generation into action, should be told by such weak storytellers.",8,2,3,11 October 2012

White of the former first lady,Jacqueline Kennedy after the assassination of President John F.Kennedy.It stars Natalie Portman who portrays the role of Jackie Kennedy together with Peter Sarsgaard, Greta Gerwig, Billy Crudup and John Hurt.The film starts when Jackie was interviewed by a journalist who happens to be Theodore White and takes us to the many events that have transpired during her and her husband's stay in the White House that ended in JFK's assassination. It presents us a peek on the private life of Jackie particularly the sorrow and misery that she has experienced and undergone when her husband was shot in Dallas,Texas and how different people around her tried to comfort her from her brother-in-law Robert Kennedy,President Lyndon Johnson and many others.Too bad that the film does really nothing to tell her full story realistically as possible as it only tries to recaptures the events that took place and it does not explain what Jackie is all about as a person.Watching this film will not allow the viewers to learn more about her as her character is presented as we know her in documentaries about her for all it does is to recreate the persona and stays away to explore who the person really is. As she would say during the interview,'I maintain the right as to what comes out to the press',I felt that the movie makers felt the pressure of these words too while shooting this film as we practically know nothing new about her as it does not fully explore her humanity.What saved it from being a bad movie is Natalie Portman's portrayal.She acted excellently in it.Too bad that she is conformed with a tight script that is too scared to fully tell her character's story and humanity to the viewers.Apparently,a lawsuit from the Kennedy family was probably not a good motivation at all.That is why the viewer is treated to an underwhelming and lifeless film.",7,1,2,28 August 2017
No Strings Attached," The Film Does Not Follow Through
","No Strings Attached is a romantic comedy film starring Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher together with Cary Elwes and Kevin Kline.Elizabeth Meriwether's screenplay is about two friends that decide to make a pact to have sex with 'no strings attached'.The film is directed by Ivan Reitman.In this romantic comedy,Emma and Adam are life-long friends who almost ruin everything by having sex one morning. In order to protect their friendship, they make a pact to keep their relationship strictly casual or 'no strings attached.' that means no jealousy, no expectations, no fighting, no flowers, no baby voices. It means they can do whatever they want, whenever they want, in whatever public place they want, as long as they don't fall in love. Can you have sex without love getting in the way? And can their friendship survive?Your guess is as good as mine in the end.The movie disappoints in a way that it presents an original idea but does not follow through in the end as it concludes in a clichéd and predictable way just like most romcoms. It benefits from the presence of the talented Natalie Portman despite her lack of chemistry with Ashton Kutcher due to not being on level with the former in terms of acting capabilities.Worse,the theme presented isn't really that modern as people already were into casual sex back in the 1970's.Too bad that the film decided to end to everyone's expectations.But nevertheless,it remains entertaining due to Portman's presence alone.",8,1,3,30 October 2011
Tropic Thunder," An Action Comedy Satire About Hollywood
","Tropic Thunder is an action comedy that features Ben Stiller,Jack Black and Robert Downey,Jr. The story is about a group of actors with prima donna attitudes who were making a fictional Vietnam War movie that were taken in the middle of the jungle.Tom Cruise,Matthew McConaughey and Nick Nolte were among the other stars that appeared in the star- studded cast.It was directed by Stiller,who co-wrote the screenplay together with Justin Theroux and Etan Coen.The film takes a satirical look at Hollywood.A Vietnam War film is having difficulties being completed due to the problems encountered by the director among its stars - Tugg Speedman,Jeff Portnoy and Kirk Lazarus - that have attitude problems.The director of the film,Damien Cockburn is under very hot water with producer Les Grossman as he is unable to complete the film in time.In order to gain control of the set,Cockburn follows the advice of a Vietnam War vet - Leaf Tayback - and took his cast into the jungle and plans to film the movie with hidden camera unaware that they are in real danger.This is a film that is easy to enjoy.While many of jokes I did not find really funny considering that they are over the top and grossly offensive,it still manages to be appealing and entertaining.It did well on picking on Hollywood with regards to the issues in it with the characters of the film particularly the actors who themselves have issues with their acting careers from Tugg Speedman,an action star trying to move away from action films;Kirk Lazarus,a multi- awarded actor who wants to totally immerse into the character that he portrays; and Jack Portnoy,a comedian who has a drug problem.Added to that,the fictional war manages to effectively allude to popular war film like Rambo,The Bridge Of The River Kwai,and Platoon.Overall,it still was a manageable film despite is flaws.",9,1,2,21 September 2014
Enchanted," A Modern-Day Fairy Tale
","Enchanted is one movie that presented a fairy tale in a realistic manner at present in modern-day New York.It stars Amy Adams, Patrick Dempsey, James Marsden, Timothy Spall, Idina Menzel, Rachel Covey, and Susan Sarandon. The film was produced by Disney,written by Bill Kelly and directed by Kevin Lima.The movie revolves around a story of Giselle, an archetypal Disney Princess, who is forced from her traditional animated world of Andalasia into the live-action world of New York City.Giselle (Amy Adams) lives in Andalasia, an animated fairy tale world with talking animals, characters breaking into song and 'happily ever after' a foregone conclusion. Prince Edward (James Marsden), her designated true love, saves her from a troll and they plan to get married the next day. Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon), Edward's evil stepmother, schemes to protect her throne, which she will lose once Prince Edward is married. She throws Giselle into a portal that transports her to a world where there are no 'happy ever afters', also known as New York City.Giselle emerges in the middle of Times Square. After a number of misadventures, including causing a minor car accident, accidentally being caught in a crowd and getting on the subway, and having her tiara stolen by a homeless man in the Bowery, she meets Robert Philip (Patrick Dempsey), a hardened, yet friendly divorce lawyer. At his daughter Morgan's (Rachel Covey) insistence, Robert lets Giselle stay at their apartment. Following the ways of her fairy-tale world, Giselle recruits urban animals (of the breeds generally believed to be household pests) – pigeons, cockroaches and rats – to clean his apartment while she fashions a dress out of his curtains. Robert's girlfriend whom he was going to propose to, a fashion designer named Nancy (Idina Menzel), misunderstands the situation and runs off after arguing with Robert. At Robert's law firm, his secretary Sam (Jodi Benson) tries to find Giselle transportation home, but cannot locate Andalasia. Deciding he must part with Giselle in Central Park, Robert offers her some money. However, Giselle almost immediately gives it to an old woman who remembers Edward stabbing an MTA bus in Times Square (while under the delusion that the bus was a giant steel beast). Deciding that Giselle needs his protection, Robert rejoins her. While walking through the park, Giselle questions Robert on how he displays his affection for Nancy, before launching into a big song-and-dance number that gets the whole city singing and dancing. Giselle eventually helps Robert reconcile with Nancy by sending flowers to her, along with tickets to the King's and Queen's Ball.The story ends when Edward finds Giselle's discarded shoe and places it on Nancy's foot àla Cinderella. They happily leave for Andalasia to be married. Giselle uses her magical dress-making talents to run a successful boutique shop, assisted by both humans and animals. Both Nathaniel (in New York) and Pip (in Andalasia) become successful authors, writing self-help books based on their experiences. The last scene shows Giselle, Robert,and Morgan playing and living together happily ever after.The movie is one original and refreshing movie that still in the Disney tradition that both kids and adults will appreciate alike.It contains witty lines and great animation.Aside from that,the character of Giselle and her story will make people from all ages appreciate and relate to her.For adults it will bring out the memories of their youth into them.I attribute that to Amy Adams' excellent portrayal of Giselle.She is one hell of an actress as she is realistic as a live- action fairy.In terms of the other performances,special mention also goes to Patrick Dempsey as the lawyer and James Mardsen as the prince.Also,the music,the direction and the story also makes this film highly-recommended for everyone.In summary,everything works in all level for this movie.",10,2,2,15 October 2011
The Usual Suspects," Invites Multiple Viewings
","Near the end of The Usual Suspects, Kevin Spacey, in his Oscar-winning performance as crippled con man Roger 'Verbal' Kint, says, 'The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.' This may be the key line in this story; the farther along the movie goes, the more one realizes that not everything is quite what it seems, and what began as a conventional whodunit turns into something quite different.The Usual Suspects is a neo-noir film written by Christopher McQuarrie and directed by Bryan Singer. It stars Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio del Toro, Chazz Palminteri, Kevin Pollak, Kevin Spacey and Pete Postlethwaite.The film follows the interrogation of Roger 'Verbal' Kint, a small-time con man who is one of only two survivors of a massacre and fire on a ship docked at the Port of Los Angeles. He tells an interrogator a convoluted story about events that led him and four other criminals to the boat, and of a mysterious mob boss known as Keyser Söze who commissioned their work. Using flashback and narration, Kint's story becomes increasingly complex.Expertly shot and edited, The Usual Suspects gives the audience a simple plot and then piles on layers of deceit, twists, and violence before pulling out the rug from underneath.A terrific cast of exciting actors socks over this absorbingly complicated yarn that's been spun in seductively slick fashion by director Bryan Singer.Screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie's tough-guy dialogue gives the ensemble cast every opportunity to shine, and they do in this freshest, funniest and scariest crime thriller to come along since Pulp Fiction.This will definitely tempt the viewer to appreciate it for it stands up under and would definitely invite multiple viewings.",10,1,2,17 January 2012
Flashdance," Flashdance Is The Ultimate Guilty Pleasure Classic
","Flashdance probably launched the guilty pleasure classics of the 1980's for which future dance movies such as Footloose and Dirty Dancing followed suit.It was smashed by the critics at the time of its release due to many formulaic movies themes applied to it but it managed to gross more than $100 million at the box office.The movie was the first collaboration between Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer,the producers of Tom Cruise movies,Top Gun and Days Of Thunder.It stars Jennifer Beals as Alex,a Pittsburgh woman with two jobs as a welder and an exotic dancer wants to get into ballet school.The other stars in the film includes Michael Nouri and Lilia Skala.The film was directed by Adrian Lyne. The story involves teen-age Alexandra 'Alex' Owens works as a welder at a steel mill in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania during the day, and as a dancer at Mawby's bar in the evenings. She lives alone in a converted warehouse with her pet dog, Grunt. Despite a lack of formal dance training, she aspires to be accepted by a prestigious dance school, the fictional Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance and Repertory. During one of her performances at Mawby's, she attracts the interest of Nick Hurley (Michael Nouri), her boss at the steel mill, and he learns that Alex is one of his employees.Alex goes to the Conservatory to ask for an application form for an audition, but runs out of the building when she realizes that since she lacks formal training and professional experience, she would have to leave much of the form blank. Alex's dance teacher and mentor is a retired ballet dancer named Hanna Long (Lilia Skala), who encourages Alex to pursue her dream of becoming a professional ballet dancer. After Jeanie falls twice while auditioning for an ice show, she loses confidence in herself and becomes a dancer at The Zanzibar, where she performs in the nude, and Alex goes to the strip club to rescue Jeanie. Alex and Nick become lovers, but he has an ex-wife named Katie (Belinda Bauer), and they have a hostile encounter in a local restaurant. Nick uses his contacts at the Conservatory to secure an audition. Just before the audition, Alex goes to Hanna's house and learns that she has died. At the audition, Alex falls at the beginning of her routine, but starts over and completes the routine successfully. In the final scene, Alex runs out of the Conservatory building with a smile on her face and is hugged by Nick, who gives her a bouquet of red roses. She gives a rose to him, and the film ends with a freeze frame. The ending of the film does not say directly whether Alex wins a place at the Conservatory as a result of her audition.The movie is characterized,just like what I've said in the first paragraph by numerous elements of guilty pleasures that a viewers seeks in an entertaining movie such as romance,teen-age memories,formulaic themes,predictability,interesting characters, great choreographed dance scenes, and sequences in the style of music videos.Aside from that,it has many memorable original 80's songs classics such as 'Maniac' by Michael Sembello;'Lady, Lady, Lady', by Joe Esposito; 'Gloria' and 'Imagination' by Laura Branigan; 'I'll Be Here Where The Heart Is' by Kim Carnes and the Academy Award-winning 'Flashdance... What a Feeling' by Irene Cara.Of course,the final dance scene at the audition is also worth the mention.In terms of acting,Jennifer Beals shines in her film debut as Alex.She gives an electrifying performance despite the lack of depth given to her character.Also,she is very engaging as we do care for her character to succeed in her aspirations as a dancer.Overall,Flashdance can be considered as the ultimate guilty pleasure classic.It was made not to please the critics but to please the audience who wants to relax and would prefer not to go into deep thinking but rather seek pure entertainment when watching a movie.With this objective,the movie delivers.",7,4,6,13 October 2011
Resident Evil," More Of A Live Video Game Than A Movie
","Resident Evil is a horror film written and directed by Paul W.S. Anderson. The film stars Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez, Eric Mabius, and James Purefoy. It is the first installment in the Resident Evil film series, which is based on the Capcom survival horror series Resident Evil that borrowed elements from the video games Resident Evil and Resident Evil 2.The story follows amnesiac heroine Alice and a band of Umbrella Corporation commandos as they attempt to contain the outbreak of the T-Virus at a secret underground facility.Resident Evil presents Alice and Rain,two members of a commando team assigned to infiltrate the Hive, an underground research laboratory owned by the faceless conglomerate known as the Umbrella Corporation. A bio-engineered virus has been released into the maze-like Hive, turning the facility's employees into mindless, flesh-eating zombies. A single scratch or bite from one of these rampaging ghouls dooms its victim, so the commandos have their work cut out for them as they attempt to reach the Red Queen, the lab's supercomputer -- and their sole hope of halting the spread of the contagion. Before they can complete their mission, however, the soldiers must overcome a variety of deadly obstacles, including mutant dogs, lasers, and a genetically altered beast known as The Licker, whose strength increases with every victim it slays. Alice and Rain also discover that the release of the virus may not have been an accident, and that a cure may exist somewhere in the deadly Hive.Resident Evil is more a live video game than a movie.Despite of its outstanding visuals and production values,it loud,cheesy and formulaic.Also,its primary purpose is to entertain and astound the viewer with its special effects rather than tell a story.",6,1,3,8 November 2011
Dirty Dancing," All The Elements Of A Guilty Pleasure
","What movie has all the elements of a guilty pleasure? I think that Dirty Dancing has all of it.The movie stars Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey in the lead roles as Johnny and Baby respectively.The cast also includes Cynthia Rhodes and Jerry Orbach. The story is a coming of age drama that documents a teenage girl's rebellion against her father by starting a relationship with a dance instructor during the family's summer vacation.The film was set in thee summer of 1963.A 17-year-old New Yorker Frances 'Baby' Houseman is vacationing with her affluent family at Kellerman's,a resort in the Catskill Mountains. She is planning to attend Mount Holyoke College to study economics of underdeveloped countries and then enter the Peace Corps. Her father, Jake, is the personal physician of Max Kellerman, the owner of the resort.Baby develops a crush on the resort's dance instructor Johnny Castle, part of the working class entertainment staff. When she, while carrying a watermelon, is invited to one of their secret after-hour parties, she observes the 'dirty dancing' for the first time. She is intrigued by the sexy dancing, and receives a brief, impromptu lesson from Johnny. Later, she discovers that his dance partner Penny Johnson (Cynthia Rhodes) is distraught over being pregnant by Robbie Gould,the womanizing waiter who is dating and cheating on Baby's sister Lisa. In her efforts to help, Baby also becomes Penny's substitute dancer for a performance at the Sheldrake, a nearby resort where Johnny and Penny perform annually. The upcoming show requires Johnny to train Baby to become a better dancer and learn the required routine.As Baby becomes Johnny's pupil in dancing, tempers flare and a romance begins to develop in the process. Their performance at the Sheldrake goes reasonably well, though she is too nervous to accomplish the dance's climactic lift. When they return to Kellerman's, they learn that Penny's backstreet abortion was botched, leaving her in agonizing pain. Baby brings her father to help, but he assumes that the pregnancy was caused by Johnny, and he therefore forbids Baby to have anything to do with Johnny or his friends. Jake is furious at Baby for lying to him and betraying his trust. Baby, however, defies him and sneaks out to visit Johnny in his room that same night, where they consummate their blossoming romance.Johnny's and Baby's relationship is eventually revealed after Johnny is accused of stealing a wallet from one of the resort guests and is unable to provide a verifiable alibi. To save Johnny from being fired, Baby confesses that Johnny could not have been responsible as she was with him in his cabin that night. He is eventually cleared of the theft charge, but is still fired for having an affair with a guest. However, Baby's selfless act inspires Johnny to realize that 'there are people willing to stand up for other people no matter what it costs them.' Even after being fired, Johnny returns to the resort to perform the final dance of the season with Baby. The film ends with an iconic dance finale.Just like what I said in the first paragraph,I think that the 1987 movie,Dirty Dancing has ALL THE ELEMENTS OF GUILTY PLEASURE.It has drama,comedy,romance between two people of different backgrounds - rich and poor,cheese,predictability,teen-age lust,trying to find oneself and of course,dancing.The DANCE FINALE between Johnny and Baby remains ICONIC up to present.There is a lot more I can tell you that.That is why this movie has become a favorite of many people all throughout the years despite of its predictability and many plot holes.Of course,what makes is memorable is the Oscar Best Original Song winner,'(I've Had) The Time Of My Life' by Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes.Added to that,the title of the movie,'Dirty Dancing' was not about dirty dancing at all BUT to catch the audience attention into watching the movie.Although a lot of people do enjoy this movie not due to the intelligence of the story BUT due to the pleasure,numerous formula found in other movies and entertainment it provides to the viewer.Honestly,I believe that this is a classic movie in the 1980's but not a timeless one due to just like what I said,'Dirty Dancing contains all the elements of guilty pleasure'. A 7/10 rating is fair for this movie.",7,1,1,13 October 2011
Independence Day," A Spectacle Of A Movie
","Independence Day is a military science fiction disaster film about an alien invasion of Earth.It stars Will Smith,Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman together with Margaret Colin,Vivica A. Fox,Mary McDonnell,Judd Hirsch,Robert Loggia,Randy Quaid and James Rebhorn. The narrative focuses on a disparate group of people who converge in the Nevada desert and, along with the rest of the human population, participate in a last- chance counterattack on July 4,which is the same date as the Independence Day holiday in the United States.It was directed by German director Roland Emmerich, who co-wrote the script with producer Dean Devlin.The film begins with the approach of a series of massive spaceships, which many on Earth greet with open arms, looking forward to the first contact with alien life. Unfortunately, these extraterrestrials have not come in peace, and they unleash powerful weapons that destroy most of the world's major cities. Thrown into chaos, the survivors struggle to band together and put up a last-ditch resistance in order to save the human race. As this is a Hollywood film, this effort is led by a group of scrappy Americans, including a computer genius who had foreseen the alien's evil intent, a hot-shot jet pilot, and the President of the United States.It's the first futuristic disaster movie that's as cute as a button. Which, when all the special effects blow over, is what the viewer like in a monster hit.And they are willing to overlook any flaws that this movie has like thin plot and poor character development.But nevertheless,it has proved to be a a thrilling, spectacle- filled,entertaining and visually stunning movie.",8,1,2,3 October 2012
Gone with the Wind," Dated But A Benchmark For Historical Epic Movies
","Gone with the Wind is a historical epic picture adapted from Margaret Mitchell's Pulitzer-winning 1936 novel of the same title. It was directed by Victor Fleming from a screenplay by Sidney Howard. The film stars Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, Leslie Howard, Olivia de Havilland, and Hattie McDaniel.It was set in the nineteenth century and tells a story of the American Civil War and Reconstruction era from a Southern point of view.It boils down to a story about a spoiled Southern girl's hopeless love for a married man. Producer David O. Selznick managed to expand this concept, and Margaret Mitchell's best-selling novel, into nearly four hours' worth of screen time, on a then-astronomical 3.7- million-dollar budget, creating what would become one of the most beloved movies of all time. Gone With the Wind opens in April of 1861, at the palatial Southern estate of Tara, where Scarlett O'Hara hears that her casual beau Ashley Wilkes plans to marry 'mealy mouthed' Melanie Hamilton. Despite warnings from her father and her faithful servant Mammy, Scarlett intends to throw herself at Ashley at an upcoming barbecue at Twelve Oaks. Alone with Ashley, she goes into a fit of histrionics, all of which is witnessed by roguish Rhett Butler, the black sheep of a wealthy Charleston family, who is instantly fascinated by the feisty, thoroughly self-centered Scarlett.Gone with the Wind's famous action continues from the burning of Atlanta through the now-classic closing line, 'Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.' The movie is definitely one of the greatest movies ever made.It won 10 Academy Awards, a record that stood for 20 years with Ben-Hur surpassing it in 1960.It was an engaging movie from beginning to end.The performances of cast like Clark Gable and most especially,Vivien Leigh were definitely excellent and outstanding.It maybe dated but it serves as a benchmark for historical epic movies.",10,1,2,11 November 2011
The Butterfly Effect," Interesting Premise But Gets Sidetracked
","The Butterfly Effect is a science-fiction psychological thriller film features Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart. Chaos theory teaches us that small events can have enormous consequences.It informs us that butterfly flapping its wings in Asia could result in a hurricane halfway around the world.Its title refers to the butterfly effect.Also,this hypothetical effect illustrates how small initial differences may lead to large unforeseen consequences over time.The film was written and directed by Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber.Evan Treborn has been experiencing blackouts at moments of high emotional stress, such as when a friend of the family molested him, or when he and some friends became involved in a prank-gone-bad,since he age 7. Later,he learns that, by concentrating on the words in a journal he composed while growing up,he finds that he has the ability to travel back in time to inhabit his former self - that is, his adult mind inhabits his younger body and to change the present by changing his past behaviors.Sometimes, he can make changes; sometimes he can't. When a childhood friend, Kayleigh Miller, commits suicide because of something Evan does, he becomes obsessed with reworking her life. And, when he does, he learns that he might have been better off not meddling with the complex formula of cause-and-effect for there are unintended consequences for all. Ashton Kutcher has this opportunity to prove his haters that he can act and probably shed 'Punk'd' and 'That '70s Show' as well as the 'go-to guy' for romantic comedies.I think that he did a decent job in this film but it has yet to satisfy his harshest critics that he can really act. Many of his fans pointed out that this film is one evidence that he can deliver in the portrayal of Steve Jobs in his latest movie,Jobs.Too bad,that film only allowed the critics to held on to their beliefs about his lack of capability as a dramatic actor as he lacked the conviction of playing Evan that the viewer was barely absorbed in his character.With regards to the film,I think that it is a serviceable thriller and science fiction.Although it has an interesting premise,the story fails considering that there were plot holes in it and it is basically flawed. Also,it was sort of sloppily conceived and unevenly paced.Added to that,it gets sidetracked to sex and violence as it resorts to gratuitous piece of sadism, sexuality or sleaze.",9,1,3,13 August 2013
Legends of the Fall," Not A Classic But Above Average
","The sweeping, melodramatic saga of three brothers, their powerful father, and a beautiful woman, the popular period drama Legends of the Fall presents a romanticized view of rugged masculinity against lush Montana scenery. Based on a novel by Jim Harrison, the film covers decades in the lives of Alfred, Tristan, and Samuel Ludlow, the sons of retired military man William Ludlow. Legends of the Fall is an epic film based on the 1979 novella of the same title by Jim Harrison.It stars Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins and Aidan Quinn together with Julia Ormond,Henry Thomas,and Karina Lombard.The movie was directed by Edward Zwick.Raised by the unorthodox Ludlow after the departure of their mother, the boys grow up close, sharing an appreciation of the land and a pioneering spirit. The family becomes divided, however, when young Sam enlists in World War I over his father's objections, and his brothers follow suit to protect him. Despite these efforts, Sam dies in battle, leaving Alfred and Tristan to return home and deal with the lingering torment. Further complicating matters is the presence of Sam's beautiful fiancÃ©e, Susannah. After Sam's death, she attracts the romantic attention of both the responsible Alfred and the brooding Tristan, a conflict that threatens to drive the brothers apart. Aspiring to epic status, the film utilizes period detail and attractive landscapes as a backdrop for tragic, doomed romance.This is a magnificent melodrama that has a combination of emotion and grand historical scale similar to the James Dean 1956 classic,The Giant.Aside from that,it has brilliant performances from its cast especially Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins.Although it lacks an emotional punch to become a compelling and absorbing film,it is far from being a classic but it still is an above average film.",10,1,4,29 December 2011

","When a Vietnam veteran discovers two million dollars while wandering through the aftermath of a Texas drug deal gone horribly awry, his decision to abscond with the cash sets off a violent chain reaction in a stripped-down crime drama from Joel and Ethan Coen entitled,No Country for Old Men.The film was based on the Cormac McCarthy novel of the same title.It features Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin. Themes of fate, conscience and circumstance re-emerge that the Coen brothers have previously explored in Blood Simple and Fargo.Llewelyn Moss has just stumbled into the find of a lifetime.

Not that there aren't moments of intense violence, but it is their quietest, most existential film yet.Finally,what makes the movie a masterpiece, however, is not the Coens' supreme command of their craft in these scenes, but their willingness to embrace the resigned world view of McCarthy's novel.Truly,a masterpiece!!!",10,3,3,22 October 2012
District 9," A Science Fiction Classic
","Director Neill Blomkamp teams with producer Peter Jackson for this tale of extraterrestrial refugees stuck in contemporary South Africa.District 9 is a science fiction thriller that was written by Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell that features Sharlto Copley, Jason Cope, and David James. The story of the film pivots on the themes of humanity, xenophobia and social segregation.It's been 28 years since the aliens made first contact, but there was never any attack from the skies, nor any profound technological revelation capable of advancing our society. Instead, the aliens were treated as refugees. They were the last of their kind, and in order to accommodate them, the government of South Africa set up a makeshift home in District 9 as politicians and world leaders debated how to handle the situation. As the humans begin to grow wary of the unwelcome intruders, a private company called Multi-National United is assigned the task of controlling the aliens. But the organization is less interested in the aliens' welfare than attempting to understand how their weaponry works. Should they manage to make that breakthrough, they will receive tremendous profits to fund their research. Unfortunately, the highly advanced weaponry requires alien DNA in order to be activated. When MNU field operative Wikus van der Merwe is exposed to biotechnology that causes his DNA to mutate, the tensions between the aliens and the humans intensifies. Wikus is the key to unlocking the alien's technology, and he quickly becomes the most wanted man on the planet. Ostracized and isolated, Wikus retreats to District 9 in a desperate bid to shake his dogged pursuers.Technically brilliant and emotionally wrenching, the film has action, imagination, and all the elements of a thoroughly entertaining science- fiction classic.That is one reason why it is a must-see film.",10,1,3,19 October 2012
Mamma Mia!," Lots Of Fun
","Mamma Mia! is a musical/romantic comedy film adapted from the 1999 West End/2001 Broadway musical of the same name, based on the songs of successful pop group ABBA, with additional music composed by ABBA member Benny Andersson.The title originates from ABBA's 1975 chart-topper 'Mamma Mia'. Meryl Streep heads the cast, playing the role of single mother Donna Sheridan together with Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, and Stellan Skarsgård,who play the three possible fathers to Donna's daughter, Sophie,played by Amanda Seyfried.The other cast includes Julie Walters,Dominic Cooper,Christine Baranski and Juan Pablo Di Pace. The film was directed by Phyllida Lloyd.Independent-minded single mother Donna has always done her best to raise her spirited daughter, Sophie, while simultaneously running a successful hotel on a small Greek island, but now the time has come for this hardworking mom to finally let go. In just a few days, Sophie will be married, and Donna will stand by bittersweetly as her little girl takes flight. Of course, Donna's lifelong friends Rosie and Tanya will both be present at the wedding, but unbeknownst to the mother, Sophie has furtively invited three very special guests of her own. When Sophie walks down the aisle on that fateful day, she wants her father to hand her off. The only problem is that Donna has never revealed the true identity of Sophie's father, leaving the resourceful future bride to narrow the list down to three potential candidates. Now, as three key figures from Donna's past return to the picturesque Mediterranean shores they all walked 20 years prior, one beautiful bride will discover the secret of her past while one.It wasn't a perfect adaptation, but it definitely captured the flavor, spirit and fun of the original material despite the fact that this jukebox musical is full of fun. Unfortunately,rough singing voices and a campy tone might not make you feel like dancing.But nevertheless,there's a neat free spirit versus family values message here, about a dad being no big deal when you can have three. Not to mention that family is more about who loves you, than whatever does or doesn't dangle between their legs.",8,1,1,16 April 2013

Later Jesse weeps and rides away. Dick decides to apologize to the Fords by traveling back to Martha's farm. Wood returns from Kentucky to the Bolton farmhouse during Dick's visit and rushes up the staircase to the closed bedroom door, and Bob and Dick prepare themselves for the imminent gunfight. After a short gun battle, Bob shoots Wood in the back of his head. Fords dumps his body in the woods and hatch a plan to conceal this event from Jesse. Jesse re-emerges one night to pay a visit to the Fords. During dinner, Jesse notices Bob's anxiety and forces Bob to tell a story. Bob then reluctantly recites a long list of similarities he has with Jesse. At his home in St. Joseph, Jesse learns of Wood's disappearance.Bob loses respect for Jesse as he realizes the nickel books he had read little resemble the man. Bob talks with Kansas City police commissioner Henry Craig, saying that he has information regarding Jesse James's whereabouts. To prove his allegiance with the James gang, Bob urges Craig to arrest Dick Liddil, who has been staying at the Bolton farm.Days after Dick's arrest, Bob attends a party held by the Governor of Missouri, Thomas T. Crittenden, celebrating Henry Craig's efforts to finally rid Jackson County of the James Gang. To Bob's surprise, Dick Liddil has been released from jail and is now meeting with the governor. It is revealed that authorities aren't particularly interested in prosecuting Liddil; they're really after Jesse James. To save himself, Liddil has disclosed information about the James gang's robberies in his confession. Bob is brought into a meeting with the governor, and subsequently strikes up a deal with him. Bob is given 10 days to capture or assassinate Jesse James for a bounty of $10,000, and is given further instructions by Craig's partner, Sheriff James Timberlake. Meanwhile, on the way back from St. Joseph, Jesse talks to Charley about suicide. Charley then convinces Jesse to take Bob under his wing. The brothers move in with Jesse to his home in St. Joseph, where they stay with Jesse's wife Zee and their two children. One night in the living room, Jesse invites the Fords to take part in the robbery of the Platte City bank. He enacts the way he'll cut the cashier's throat, and demonstrates this by holding a knife to Bob's neck. Convinced that Jesse will eventually kill them, Bob decides to kill him first. As a way to apologize for his actions, Jesse gives Bob a brand new pistol on April Fools' Day, and tells him that he fears for his own sanity. On a day soon thereafter, Jesse goes out to retrieve the latest newspaper. As it contains a story about Liddil's arrest and confession,a terrified Bob had slipped the front section of the newspaper under a shawl, then strapped on his gun holster before sitting down in the kitchen for breakfast.Jesse walks back to the sitting-room and discovers the hidden section of the newspaper, learning of Dick's confession. Jesse glares at Bob, and asks why this matter hadn't been reported to him. Panicked, Bob excuses himself and retreats to the sitting-room rocking chair, and Charley soon follows him to put on his holster. Jesse walks in to see if the two are ready for the trip to Platte City. After some silent contemplation, Jesse takes off his gun belt and lays it on the couch. Jesse sets up a chair under a dusty portrait and climbs on top of it with a feather duster in one hand. The Fords draw their guns, and Bob shoots Jesse in the back of the head, killing him instantly. When Zee tearfully questions Bob, he denies doing or knowing anything before Charley pulls him out of the house, declaring it an 'accident'. The Fords run to the telegraph office to wire the governor with the news. A brief montage then follows, describing what is to happen to the body of Jesse James.On the strength of its two lead performances of Pitt and Affleck,Assassination is an expertly crafted period piece, and and insightful look at one of the enduring figures of American lore.Writer- director Andrew Dominik takes his time with the story, but his languorous pacing allows tension to build -- and permits the actors, Affleck in particular, to add nuance and depth to characters who'll seem familiar only at first glance.What's worse,it's a view of the West beyond the myth that's worth enduring, if not relishing.That is why did not become a commercial success.",8,1,1,5 January 2012

Cole has difficulty adjusting to the larger NASCAR stock cars and communicating with his crew while being intimidated on the track by NASCAR Winston Cup Champion Rowdy Burns,played by Michael Rooker,that results in Cole not finishing the races,mostly due to crashes or engine blowouts. After discovering that Cole does not understand the common terminology used by NASCAR teams,Harry puts him in a series of rigorous training. This pays off in future races.Aside from that,Cole develops a romantic relationship with Dr.Claire Lewicki,played by the gorgeous Nicole Kidman.The story has all the elements of Top Gun.It is predictable and clichéd from beginning to end.Aside from that,this wasn't exciting as compared to Top Gun despite of having Scott and Cruise involved in it.Days Of Thunders simply felt like a formulaic movie from start to finish with nothing original in it.The same with the characters as well as they were based from Top Gun as well.In the end,if you want to see how elements of Top Gun on wheels,then this movie is it.",7,4,4,8 October 2011

After his mother and father are murdered by a mugger, however, Wayne grows into an impudent young man, full of rage and bent on retribution until encouraged by his childhood sweetheart, Rachel Dawes, to search for answers beyond his own personal vendettas. Wayne eventually finds discipline in the Far East under the tutelage of Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), a member of the mysterious League of Shadows who guides him in the study of martial arts -- and the ways in which an ordinary man can hone his senses to an almost superhuman acuity. After seven years away from Gotham, Wayne returns, determined to bring peace and safety back to the city. With the help of his faithful manservant, Alfred Pennyworth, and Lucius Fox, a scientist at his late father's corporation, Wayne develops a secret identity as Batman, a masked fighter for justice. But when a shady psychiatrist joins forces with the criminal underworld, Wayne realizes that putting an end to their nefarious plans will be very difficult indeed.Brooding and dark, but also exciting and smart, Batman Begins is a film that understands the essence of one of the definitive superheroes.It's not just the birth of Batman we're seeing in this triumphant interpretation, it's also the dawning of Gotham City's age of greed.A moody and visually stimulating superhero film, Batman Begins sees the Dark Knight finally giving the treatment and respect he deserves, in what can only be described as one of the greatest re-vamps given to an enduring character.It gives a blast of energy that reinvents the Dark Knight with so much ingenuity for a new generation of film-goers.Nolan succeeds in making this new Batman franchise simply an unforgettable reboot of the caped-crusader.",10,1,2,14 January 2012

To Rome With Love," Minor Compared To Other Woody Allen Films
","To Rome With Love is a film of Woody Allen that tells a story of four separate vignettes such as: a clerk who wakes up to himself a celebrity; an architect who takes a trip back to the street wherein he lived as a student;a young couple on their honeymoon; and an Italian funeral director who possesses a singing ability that captures his soon to be in-law who happens to be an American opera director.The ensemble cast of the movie includes Woody Allen himself together with Alec Baldwin,Roberto Benigni,Penélope Cruz,Judy Davis and Jesse Eisenberg.Compared to other Woody Allen films like for example Annie Hall,this is definitely will be considered a minor one due to underdeveloped characters and plot lines.Added to that,many unrealistic events happen that is way beyond belief and it won't be enough to generate the interest of the viewers even though the stories happen in the streets of Rome and it had a strong cast in it.Finally,the plot lines also fail to become one coherent story telling that a viewer may find it somewhat boring and uninteresting at some parts of the movie.",7,1,1,14 September 2014

All legends bring forth great enthusiasm and provides great comedy that will elicit lots of laughter from the viewers.Despite of seemingly repeated gags and jokes from the first film,the great talent involved raised the level of the film to make it funny as they make their roles to be likable characters.Overall,it was still worth watching especially for those who enjoyed the first film immensely.",9,1,1,20 September 2014
Non-Stop," Great But Fails At The Conclusion
","Non-Stop is a mystery action thriller that has its events occurs 40,000 feet above inside an airplane. It stars Liam Neeson as Bill Marks,a U.S. Federal Air Marshall who was set up to do an impossible task of inside an airplane,together with a brilliant supporting cast led by recent Oscar winner Julianne Moore as well as Michelle Dockery, Lupita Nyong'o and Scoot McNairy. Bill Marks is an alcoholic Federal Marshal that was enrolled in the Air Marshall after he was discharged from the New York City Police Department.On a Boeing 767 non-stop flight from New York to London, he receives text messages on his secure phone stating that someone on the plane will die every 20 minutes unless $150 million is transferred into a specific bank account.Just like its title,Non-Stop provided non-stop suspense in the first 80 minutes.No question that Liam Neeson is solid as Bill Marks,a man who intends to redeem himself in the current situation that he is in.The action was also intense as Marks try to solve the mystery of the man who assigns him of doing the impossible tasks and tries to locate his identity among the passengers.Too bad that the conclusion somewhat becomes implausible and unrealistic as the action sequence was simply cheesy especially when Marks killed the killer with the help of the co-pilot. If the conclusion was handled better by the writers,it could have been one of the best action thrillers of the year.",8,1,1,11 March 2015
Man on the Moon," The Best Performance Of Carrey's Career
","Man on the Moon is a biographical comedy-drama film about the American entertainer Andy Kaufman, starring Jim Carrey. The film was directed by Milo Forman and also features Courtney Love, Paul Giamatti and Danny DeVito. Other members of that show's cast, including Marilu Henner, Judd Hirsch, Christopher Lloyd and Jeff Conaway, make cameo appearances in the film, playing themselves.The story traces Kaufman's steps from childhood through the comedy clubs, and television appearances that made him famous, including his memorable appearances on Saturday Night Live, Late Night with David Letterman, Fridays, and his role as 'Latka Gravas' on the Taxi sitcom, which was popular for viewers but disruptive for Kaufman's co-stars. The film pays particular attention to the various inside jokes, scams, put- ons, and happenings for which Kaufman was famous, most significantly his long-running 'feud' with wrestler Jerry 'The King' Lawler and his portrayal of the bawdy lounge singer Tony Clifton.Carrey received critical acclaim for his chameleon performance and won a Golden Globe—his second win in a row.With this recognition,it was obvious that he played Kaufman wonderfully which was simply brilliant and with an almost terrifying impersonation that leaves the viewer mesmerized and entertained.Watching this movie,the audience would leave the theater talking about the character he portrayed.Aside from that, the film remains true to Kaufman's stubborn vision.Finally,this is absolutely the best performance of Carrey's career.",10,2,4,3 September 2012

It was directed by Rob Reiner from a screenplay by Goldman. The story is presented in the film as a book being read by a grandfather to his sick grandson, thus effectively preserving the novel's narrative style.The screenplay offers a tongue-in-cheek fairy tale depicting stable boy- turned-pirate Westley's journey to rescue Buttercup, his true love, away from the evil prince, whom she had agreed to marry five years after learning of what she had believed to be news of Westley's death. With help from Prince Humperdinck's disgruntled former employee Miracle Max, swordsman Inigo Montoya, and a very large man named Fezzik, the star- crossed lovers are reunited. This is a delightfully postmodern fairy tale.It is a deft, intelligent mix of swashbuckling, romance, and comedy that takes an age-old damsel- in-distress story and makes it fresh.The Princess Bride has often been copied, but never equaled.Thus,it has proved to be the benchmark for fairy tale movies.",10,4,6,27 September 2012
Saving Private Ryan," Saving Private Ryan: Truly A Masterpiece
","Steven Spielberg directed this powerful, realistic re-creation of WWII's D-day invasion and the immediate aftermath in this movie,Saving Private Ryan.The story,written by Robert Rodat,is loosely based on the real-life case of the Niland brothers.It features Tom Hanks as U.S. Army Captain John H. Miller,together with Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg,Jeremy Davies and Matt Damon as Private First Class James Francis Ryan,a paratrooper who is the last surviving brother of four servicemen.The story opens with a prologue in which a veteran brings his family to the American cemetery at Normandy, and a flashback then joins Capt. John Miller and GIs in a landing craft making the June 6, 1944, approach to Omaha Beach to face devastating German artillery fire. Miller's men slowly move forward to finally take a concrete pillbox. On the beach littered with bodies is one with the name 'Ryan' stenciled on his backpack. Army Chief of Staff Gen. George C. Marshall, learning that three Ryan brothers from the same family have all been killed in a single week, requests that the surviving brother, Pvt. James Ryan, be located and brought back to the United States. Capt. Miller gets the assignment, and he chooses a translator, Cpl. Upham, skilled in language but not in combat, to join his squad of right-hand man Sgt. Horvath, plus privates Mellish, Medic Wade, cynical Reiben from Brooklyn, Italian-American Caparzo, and religious Southerner Jackson, an ace sharpshooter who calls on the Lord while taking aim. Having previously experienced action in Italy and North Africa, the close-knit squad sets out through areas still thick with Nazis. After they lose one man in a skirmish at a bombed village, some in the group begin to question the logic of losing more lives to save a single soldier.Saving Private Ryan develops into a powerful and potent portrayal of men at war.It sets a new benchmark for realism in World War II films, and defined war movies for a generation. A film of scope and vision rarely experienced, its award-winning cinematography and sound editing helped convey the blood-chilling images that presents war as violent,harrowing, and horrific.Aside from that,it also presents a soul especially with the characters involved.The cast provided brilliant and excellent performances especially from its lead star,Tom Hanks.And definitely,Spielberg was masterful in his direction of the film as he sends an anti-war message but not to the point of condemning patriotism and love for one's country and countrymen.Truly a masterpiece.",10,2,3,28 December 2011
The Pianist," Polanski's Best Work In Years
","The Pianist is a 2002 biographical war film directed by Roman Polanski, starring Adrien Brody. It is an adaptation of the autobiography of the same name by Jewish-Polish musician Władysław Szpilman. This downbeat drama based on the true story of a privileged musician who spent five years struggling against the Nazi occupation of Warsaw. Wladyslaw Szpilman is a gifted classical pianist born to a wealthy Jewish family in Poland. The Szpilmans have a large and comfortable flat in Warsaw which Wladyslaw shares with his mother and father, his sisters Halina and Regina, and his brother, Henryk. While Wladyslaw and his family are aware of the looming presence of German forces and Hitler's designs on Poland, they're convinced that the Nazis are a menace which will pass, and that England and France will step forward to aid Poland in the event of a real crisis. Wladyslaw's naïveté is shattered when a German bomb rips through a radio studio while he performs a recital for broadcast. During the early stages of the Nazi occupation, as a respected artist, he still imagines himself above the danger, using his pull to obtain employment papers for his father and landing a supposedly safe job playing piano in a restaurant. But as the German grip tightens upon Poland, Wladyslaw and his family are selected for deportation to a Nazi concentration camp. Refusing to face a certain death, Wladyslaw goes into hiding in a comfortable apartment provided by a friend. However, when his benefactor goes missing, Wladyslaw is left to fend for himself and he spends the next several years dashing from one abandoned home to another, desperate to avoid capture by German occupation troops. It's Roman Polanski's strongest and most personally felt movie.It is the director's finest achievement, and elevates Adrien Brody (Oscar win for Best Actor 2002) to eminence in his representation of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jew who survived the Nazi occupation of Warsaw.Well- acted and dramatically moving, The Pianist is Polanski's best work in years.",10,1,1,25 February 2012

He will deliver anything anywhere, but he has three iron-clad rules - once the plan is in motion it cannot be changed, neither he nor his customers are to ever use their real names, and under no circumstances will he open the package. Martin is hired to make a delivery to a wealthy but unscrupulous American known as Wall Street, but after taking possession of the package he realizes that whatever is inside happens to be alive. Breaking his own rule, Martin opens the bag to discover a beautiful Asian woman, Lai, who is bound and gagged.

Martin's conscience gets the better of him, and he sets out to rescue Lai and put Wall Street and Mr. Kwai out of business; however, as if this wasn't enough of a challenge, Martin discovers a French detective, Tarconi has gotten wind of his illegal business. The Transporter is one hell of an action film.It presents actions scenes that are merely to entertain regardless whether they are realistic or not.It spends of its time between car chases and martial-arts bouts with random scuba-diving footage.Also,it has a lot more fights, explosions, and more fights, but with a flair.Overall,the actions scenes are simply excellent and outstanding as a means to entertain in lieu of a good story and character development.",6,1,1,8 November 2011
Seabiscuit," An Epic Sports Figure Story
","For his sophomore effort, director Gary Ross re-teams with Tobey Maguire and William H. Macy, stars of his directorial debut Pleasantville, for this sports drama about the legendary racehorse, Seabiscuit. Unlike 1949's fictionalized The Story of Seabiscuit starring Shirley Temple, this version attempts to present a factual account of the story, which centers around the three men who saw the famed horse to victory.This biographical sports drama film based on the best-selling non-fiction book Seabiscuit: An American Legend by Laura Hillenbrand. The film is loosely based on the life and racing career of Seabiscuit, an undersized and overlooked thoroughbred race horse, whose unexpected successes made him a hugely popular media sensation in the United States during the Great Depression.Jeff Bridges,Chris Cooper and Elizabeth Banks co-star to play key supporting roles.Charles Howard is an entrepreneur who owns the unlikely racehorse. Howard teams with partially blind boxer-turned-jockey Red Pollard and horse trainer Tom Smith. Together, the three work to help the famed horse to several symbolic victories that helped to inspire a downtrodden 1930s America.It's inspiring despite a sobering thesis: The future is intoxicating, but progress is a kind way of rendering someone's livelihood obsolete. Gary Ross probed the underdog principle's heart: Success outside the comfort zone is the sweetest of all.It may not be a work of great art but it tells its solid story with grace and dignity.And most of all,this is a great story of American entrepreneurship, optimism, and resilience.It definitely is an epic treatment of a spirit-lifting figure in sports history.",10,2,4,14 October 2012

The IMF is shut down when it's implicated in a global terrorist bombing plot. Ghost Protocol is initiated and Ethan Hunt and his rogue new team must go undercover to clear their organization's name. No help, no contact, off the grid. You have never seen a mission grittier and more intense than this Mission Impossible film franchise,better known as 'The Ethan Hunt Show' of Cruise.Stylish, fast-paced, and loaded with gripping set pieces, this big- budget popcorn entertainment really works for Tom Cruise fans.Brad Bird passes his audition for a career as a live-action director. Aside from that, this also more than makes its bones as an argument for why Tom Cruise should continue in this role as long as his knees, and his nerves, hold up especially for very young fans of the new generation of Mission Impossible who unfortunately never had the chance to witness the classic series back in the 1960's and the excellent remake TV series during the 80's.But if young people get a chance to see the 60's TV series and the 80's remake,I think that they would find those better despite being outdated in technology for it promotes team work unlike to Tom Cruise Mission Impossible franchise that only promotes Ethan Hunt.",3,1,3,28 August 2015

Lawrence of Arabia," Epic Of All Epics
","Lawrence of Arabia is a British film based on the life of T. E. Lawrence. It was directed by David Lean and produced by Sam Spiegel through his British company, Horizon Pictures, with the screenplay by Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson. The film stars Peter O'Toole in the title role. It is widely considered one of the greatest and most influential films in the history of cinema.The film depicts Lawrence's experiences in Arabia during World War I, in particular his attacks on Aqaba and Damascus and his involvement in the Arab National Council. Its themes include Lawrence's emotional struggles with the personal violence inherent in war, his personal identity, and his divided allegiance between his native Britain and its army and his newfound comrades within the Arabian desert tribes.This sweeping, highly literate historical epic covers the Allies' mid-eastern campaign during World War I as seen through the eyes of the enigmatic T. E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole, in the role that made him a star). After a prologue showing us Lawrence's ultimate fate, we flash back to Cairo in 1917. A bored general staffer, Lawrence talks his way into a transfer to Arabia. Once in the desert, he befriends Sheriff Ali Ben El Kharish and draws up plans to aid the Arabs in their rebellion against the Turks. No one is ever able to discern Lawrence's motives in this matter: Prince Feisal dismisses him as yet another 'desert-loving Englishman,' and his British superiors assume that he's either arrogant or mad. Using a combination of diplomacy and bribery, Lawrence unites the rival Arab factions of Feisal and Auda Abu Tayi.After successfully completing his mission, Lawrence becomes an unwitting pawn of the Allies, as represented by Gen. Allenby (Jack Hawkins) and Dryden, who decide to keep using Lawrence to secure Arab cooperation against the Imperial Powers. While on a spying mission to Deraa, Lawrence is captured and tortured by a sadistic Turkish Bey. In the heat of the next battle, a wild-eyed Lawrence screams 'No prisoners!' and fights more ruthlessly than ever.The epic of all epics, Lawrence of Arabia cements director David Lean's status in the filmmaking pantheon with nearly four hours of grand scope, brilliant performances, and beautiful cinematography. Two years in the making, the movie, lensed in Spain and Jordan, ended up costing a then- staggering $13 million and won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director.",10,3,5,2 March 2012
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Far From Compelling Compared To Jurassic Park
","After the success of the film Jurassic Park,the late Michael Crichton was asked to write a sequel novel by both fans and director Steven Spielberg.This resulted in the book entitled The Lost World and a film adaptation by Spielberg entitled The Lost World: Jurassic Park,which was loosely based on the said novel.It stars Jeff Goldblum,Julianne Moore,Pete Postlethwaite,Arliss Howard,Vince Vaughn and Vanessa Lee Chester.The story of the film was set four years later after the events of Jurassic Park at a fictional deserted island called Isla Sorna that hovers around Central America particularly Costa Rica.In it are cloned dinosaurs that were produced by InGen.The company's owner John Hammond's nephew took control of the said ecosystem and he is planning to take the dinosaurs to the mainland. Learning about it,Hammond sends Dr. Ian Malcolm and his group to not allow it to happen before his nephew arrives.The story focuses on how both groups - Malcolm's group and Hammond's nephew's group - try to confront each other to pursue their objectives but ultimately team up to survive against the cloned dinosaurs amidst the extreme danger facing them.With regards to the visuals and special effects,this definitely is better as compared to the first film due to the use of Computer- generated Imagery or CGI.Too bad that it focused more on the action scenes and violence that the cloned dinosaurs caused rather than the characters involved.It also hurt that only Jeff Goldblum is the only one returning from the previous cast.Added to that,it suffered from being a sequel wherein viewers were expecting at least the same compelling entertainment it got from the first film.Too bad that The Lost Park did not deliver in that area.But it was good enough to please many viewers if expectations aren't higher compared to the first film.",8,3,20,6 November 2016

","Fernando Meirelles' City of God is a sweeping tale of how crime affects the poor population of Rio de Janeiro.City of God,also knows as Cidade de Deus,is a Brazilian crime drama film directed by Meirelles and co- directed by Kátia Lund.It was released in Brazil in 2002 and worldwide in 2003. The story was adapted by Bráulio Mantovani from the 1997 novel of the same name written by Paulo Lins, but the characters are not fictitious and the plot is based upon real events. It depicts the growth of organized crime in the Cidade de Deus suburb of Rio de Janeiro, between the end of the '60s and the beginning of the '80s, with the closure of the film depicting the war between the drug dealer Li'l Zé and criminal Knockout Ned.The cast includes Alexandre Rodrigues, Leandro Firmino da Hora, Jonathan Haagensen, Douglas Silva, Alice Braga and Seu Jorge. Most of the actors were, in fact, residents of favelas such as Vidigal and the Cidade de Deus itself.Though the narrative skips around in time, the main focus is on Cabeleira who formed a gang called the Tender Trio. He and his best friend, Bené, become crime lords over the course of a decade. When Bené is killed before he can retire, Lil' Zé attempts to take out his arch enemy, Sandro Cenoura. But Sandro and a young gangster named Mane form an alliance and begin a gang war with Lil' Zé. Amateur photographer Buscape takes pictures of the brutal crime war, making their story famous.Meirelles' Brazilian slum epic is a profound, stylistically expansive depiction of three decades of child gang warfare on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro with non-actors playing their poverty-ridden lives for the camera.The living conditions it projects are as horrendous as I had feared, but the movie is surprisingly easy to take as a rollicking homicidal entertainment as Meirelles takes us to a real-life deathtrap and then proceeds to make us feel twice as alive for the time we spend there.Each chapter is endowed with powerful, uncompromising, beguiling and, sometimes, deceptive momentum which makes it great film.Added to that,the acting from the cast was brilliant.Overall,it is a shocking and disturbing film but it give the viewer compelling look at life in the slums particularly in Brazil.",10,1,3,17 January 2012
JFK," A Cinema Masterpiece And Honest Search For Truth
","JFK is a three hour film that examines the events leading to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and alleged subsequent cover- up, through the eyes of the late former New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison - who filed charges against New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw for his alleged participation in a conspiracy to assassinate the President, for which Lee Harvey Oswald was found responsible by two Government investigations: the Warren Commission, and the House Select Committee on Assassinations that concluded that there was another assassin shooting with Oswald.JFK was adapted by Stone and Zachary Sklar from the books On the Trail of the Assassins by Jim Garrison and Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy by Jim Marrs.It stars Kevin Costner,Gary Oldman,Kevin Bacon,Tommy Lee Jones together with Laurie Metcalf,Michael Rooker,Joe Pesci,Jay O. Sanders,Donald Sutherland,John Candy and Sissy Spacek with Martin Sheen acting as the narrator of the movie. It was directed by Oliver Stone.The docudrama accounts the mystery behind the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy.The brisk investigation of that murder conducted under the guidance of Supreme Court Justice Earl Warren distressed many observers, even though subsequent careful investigations have been unable to find much fault with the conclusions his commission drew, the central one of which was that the assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, acted alone. Instead of satisfying the public, one result of the Warren Commission Report was that an unimaginable number of plausible conspiracy theories were bruited about, and these have supported a sizable publishing mini-industry ever since. But New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison is convinced that there are some big flaws in the investigation of Oswald, and he sets out to recreate the events leading up to the assassination. Along the way, he stumbles across evidence that a great many people had reason to want to see the president killed, and he is convinced that some of them worked in concert to frame Oswald as the killer. Among the suspects are Lyndon Baines Johnson,the next president of the United States, the CIA, J. Edgar Hoover, and the Mafia. Over the course of gathering what he believes to be evidence of a conspiracy, Garrison unveils some of the grittier aspects of New Orleans society,focusing on the shady activities of Clay Shaw.Garrison's investigations culminate in his conducting a show trial that he knows he will lose and which he is sure will ruin his career in order to get his evidence into the public record where it can't be buried again.In making this movie, Stone presented another theory that it was the conspiracy that involves the CIA who committed the crime of the assassination of the late President John Kennedy and what came out was one of the most compelling and controversial films ever to emerge from American cinema. The final film came out like a cinema masterpiece and an honest search for truth.The performances by Kevin Costner and Tommy Lee Jones were phenomenal.Costner had a low-key but forceful portrayal of Garrison and nicely conveys the requisite grit,curiosity and fearlessness.While Jones exhibited a great complexity and emotion to the man behind Shaw.The direction was also superb as the movie was a great ride of both information and propaganda for three hours seemed quite short in this docudrama.In the end,JFK is a must-see!!!!",10,11,21,30 October 2011
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino Does Not Hit His Mark In Creating A New 'Genre'
","Quentin Tarantino writes and directs his 9th film starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt in 'Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood'.The movie tells the story of an aging Western actor Rick Dalton,who plans to re-invent himself after his career roles are running out of fashion.Together with him is his stuntman,Cliff Booth.The year is 1969 and both go to Hollywood as Dalton intends to acquire new roles. The screenplay has a meandering plot as it takes the viewer to the 1960's with the familiar costumes,stars like Bruce Lee, and music.Added to the story is Sharon Tate together with Charlie Manson as well as the 'Manson Family'. Apparently,Tarantino's screenplay tries to present his vision and opinion of what the 60's was all about particularly in Hollywood which was the advent of the counterculture era as well as the sexual revolution.No question that Tarantino once again tries to revise history in this movie just like in his previous films such as 'Inglorious Basterds' and 'Django Unchained' - both of which he did pretty well that why I gave a 10 rating on them on my reviews.Too bad that he tries to apply it in the Charlie Manson murders and it obviously does not work unlike his previous movies. Added to that,the meandering plot sort of like confuses the viewer rather than building the tension of what was suppose to happen in the story. What is worse,viewers who do not belong to the 60's generation or who are not familiar with it will only get frustrated. Finally,anyone who isn't familiar with Charlie Manson will only be more confused and more frustrated.What made it worse is that the story does not revolve around Sharon Tate despite the fact that she is the most important figure particularly in the conclusion of the film as it revolves around Dalton and Booth together in their journey.That does not contribute to a great storytelling that other Tarantino films are characterized with such 'Pulp Fiction' which also deserved a 10 in my review.This was obviously a missed opportunity. Too bad that having Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt together with Tarantino could have produced a cinema classic rather than just another film that is trying to create a new 'genre'. Nevertheless,they managed to provide great performances particularly DiCaprio as an aging actor and Pitt being great in a secondary role.",3,34,57,3 August 2019
Gone Girl," One Of The Best Films Ever Made About Media Culture
","If many movie goers considered Left Behind that starred Nicholas Cage up for the race the worst movie of the year in 2014,then Gone Girl definitely one up for best movie during that same year.Based on Gillian Flynn's novel of the same title and the same screenwriter of the film,David Finch provides us another seemingly effortless directorial effort in this complex and complicated crime thriller which seemingly is disguised as a dark comedy despite the fact that the comedic scenes are far from being overt and obvious. Gone Girl features Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike together with Neil Patrick Harris,Carrie Coon,Kim Dickens, Missi Pyle and Tyler Perry.Set in Missouri,it tells the story of a Nicholas Dunne and the events that goes on after her wife has gone missing on their 5th wedding anniversary.It was a critically acclaimed film and a commercially successful movie that made $368 million at the box office.Pike got an Oscar nomination playing the wife,Amy Dunne.Also,it comprises thematic elements such as unreliable narratives from different characters like Nick and Amy;our media culture especially when it defines what it means to be 'popular' and 'guilty'; and the detective storyline that provides surprising twists and turns that maybe classified as similar to films made by Alfred Hitchcock.Added to that,it also provides a theme of manipulation wherein different characters manipulate each other and how the media manipulate the public by providing a public broadcast on how people should view public personalities involved in the news.The main story as I have stated earlier is about the disappearance of Amy and the events that happen.There are two segments initially told in parallel in the first half of the film.One segment provides a narrative wherein Nick becomes worried after learning that her wife is missing and the events that ensues.The other segment is the narrative provided by Amy in the entries of her diary which updates us from the time she and Nick first meet together until the problems of their marriage arise when they transferred from New York to Missouri when they both lost their job.Then things become exciting and unsettling on the third narrative wherein the truth is revealed wherein Amy is apparently not killed and has decided to frame her husband for the unhappiness and unfaithfulness he brought her into their marriage. We get to see different media personalities.We get to see some resolution to the some of the events that happen.Finally,we get to see both Amy and Nick brought back together under one roof.Many viewers felt disappointed that it never offered a clear resolution and conclusion at the end.But it only made it what it was supposed to be: unsettling.Just like most of the events that happened in the story.The performances were definitely good.That includes Ben Affleck.Although he will always be an average actor to me in my opinion,he definitely did not good work as the average and weak husband,Nick.Rosamund Pike was obviously outstanding as Amy as she convincingly played the smart wife,Amy.Special mention should also be given to Carrie Coon and Kim Dickens as Nick's sister,Margo and Detective Rhonda Boney respectively.As a crime thriller,this definitely does not follow the same trend of many movies of the same genre of that being predictable and by- the-numbers.It may have delivered what is supposed to be expected somewhat early that probably affected the progression of the story.But nevertheless,it still managed to provide joy and entertainment as it was creative,imaginative and inventive in its latter parts especially with the surprisingly unrealistic actions of the characters involved and the unexpected decisions that they later make towards the end.To conclude my review,watching this movie will definitely provide tons of satisfaction to the viewer.",10,1,5,7 March 2015
Django Unchained," The Horrors Of Slavery
","Django Unchained a Western film that takes place in America's pre-Civil War South when slavery still existed.It stars Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio together with Kerry Washington,Christoph Waltz and Samuel L. Jackson.It was written and directed by Quentin Tarantino.The story is about a partnership between an African-American slave named Django and a German-born bounty hunter,Dr. Schultz,who is on disguise as a dentist.They are on the trail of the murderous Brittle brothers and finding Django's long lost wife,Broomhilda from her cruel plantation owner named Calvin Candie.Initially,Schultz bought his partner as a slave from outlaws.But he promised him freedom and split the bounties with him if he assists him in hunting down other outlaws throughout the winter.Django agreed as long on the condition that they must also find Broomhilda.Added to story is Django's training as a bounty hunter.All ends well when Django takes Broomhilda from her cell,bids farewell to his fallen mentor and ignites the dynamite he has planted throughout the mansion at the end.This is a 165-minute long film.But in spite of its length,it is definitely not a waste of time as the viewer gets to witness the horrors of slavery in the past in addition to getting another great Spaghetti Western movie in the tradition of The Good,The Bad And The Ugly.It was definitely wildly extravagant,violent,funny and outrageously entertaining yet it also dealt well with the themes of racism and slavery.We are also treated to a exciting performances by the cast especially from DiCaprio who definitely nailed the portrayal of a plantation owner.Finally,we are treated to a clever screenplay and amazing direction from Tarantino that there is no doubt that this adds to his list of great films.",10,2,7,27 May 2014
The Theory of Everything," A Brilliant Film About Stephen Hawking's Personal Life
","This film is a biopic about brilliant physicist Stephen B. Hawking.Events of his life includes his personal struggle with the motor neuron disease throughout his life;the achievement that he made in theoretical physics; and his relationship and family life with his ex-wife Jane Wilde Hawking.The Theory Of Everything was directed by James Marsh and adapted by screenwriter Anthony McCarten from the memoir Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen written by Jane herself.It stars Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones as Stephen and Jane respectively.The movie starts with Stephen as a healthy active young man and a doctorate student at Cambridge wherein he meets fellow student Jane.Then he later was discovered to have a disease that will provide him limitations in terms of voluntary movement,control and breathing.Despite of it,he and Jane gets married to start a family life and he continues his work on physics with the study of time and universe.It focuses primarily on their relationship as well as the ups and downs that Stephen's condition had as he constantly deteriorate as the movie progresses but nevertheless continues to show the world that he is indeed one of the most brilliant minds in science despite of it.While Science fanatics will definitely be somewhat left empty as the movie does not focus on Stephen's work,it still will be considered one interesting and brilliant film as we get to see the determination of one mind who never gave up on his mission in life despite the many challenges he faced brought about by the limitations of physical ability that was caused by his disease.Also,one will definitely empathize with the solid relationship between Stephen and Jane particularly the commitment of the latter to their marriage especially with the sacrifices she made for the former's sake.Finally,it is one film that was surely well written despite the fact that the theme on Stephen's professional life as a physicists is somewhat lacking given the attention of the film to his personal life particularly his relationship with Jane.",10,1,4,5 July 2015

","2012 is a science fiction disaster film directed by Roland Emmerich. It stars John Cusack, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Amanda Peet, Oliver Platt, Thandie Newton, Danny Glover, and Woody Harrelson, among others.Disaster movie maven Emmerich crafts this apocalyptic sci-fi thriller following the prophecy stated by the ancient Mayan calendar, which says that the world will come to an end on December 21, 2012.

The Number 23," Clumsy And Confusing
","The Number 23 is a psychological thriller film written by Fernley Phillips and directed by Joel Schumacher. The film features Jim Carrey, Virginia Madsen, Danny Huston, and Logan Lerman. The plot involves an obsession with the 23 enigma, an esoteric belief that all incidents and events are directly connected to the number 23, some permutation of the number 23, or a number related to 23. It is Carrey's first leading role in a suspense thriller.Walter Sparrow is a middle-aged dogcatcher whose wife Agatha has bestowed him with an obscure mystery novel detailing the investigation launched by a tough-talking gumshoe named Fingerling whose every move seems to be overshadowed by the enigmatic eponymous number. After noting a series of alarming parallels shared between the fictional detective and himself, Walter is quickly drawn in to the story as the hard-boiled private investigator murders raven-wigged moll Fabrizia and pins the crime on her unsuspecting lover. Back in the real world, fiction seems to merge with reality as Walter and Agatha's close friend Isaac begins to ingratiate himself ever deeper into the couple's relationship and Walter begins experiencing a gruesome series of visions in which he violently murders an unfaithful Agatha. His mind fast descending into a dark and violent whirlwind of madness, Walter enlists the aid of Agatha and the pair's adolescent son Robin in seeking out the author of the mysterious tome and uncovering the sinister truth behind the so-called '23 enigma.'Jim Carrey as a schizophrenic murderer isn't convincing in this melodramatic film.Also,the story is half-baked. What makes it funny though is that Carrey's portrayal of a mentally disturbed person is what makes it comedic. Long, contemplative stares, and over-dramatized acting makes him a clichéd and uninteresting character rather than one odd enough to engage viewers.In addition to that,it is clumsy and mostly confusing.",8,2,2,26 September 2012
The Lives of Others," Unforgettable Movie About East Germany
","The Lives of Others,Das Leben der Anderen in German,is a dramatic feature that marks the directorial debut Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck.It is about the monitoring of the cultural scene of East Berlin by agents of the Stasi,the East Germany's secret police.The movie stars Ulrich Mühe as Stasi Captain Gerd Wiesler;Ulrich Tukur as his boss Anton Grubitz; Sebastian Koch as the playwright Georg Dreyman; and Martina Gedeck as Dreyman's lover as well as a prominent East German actress,Christa-Maria Sieland.It is an Academy Award winner for Best Foreign Language Film in 2006.The Lives of Others has its time setting in 1984.Capt. Gerd Wiesler is an agent of the Stasi,the East German Secret Police. Weisler carefully and dispassionately investigates people who might be deemed some sort of threat to the state. Shortly after Weisler's former classmate, Lt. Col. Grubitz, invites him to a theatrical piece by celebrated East German playwright Georg Dreyman, Minister Bruno Hempf informs Weisler that he suspects Dreyman of political dissidence, and wonders if this renowned patriot is all that he seems to be. As it turns out, Hempf has something of an ulterior motive for trying to pin something on Dreyman: a deep- seated infatuation with Christa-Maria Sieland, Dreyman's girlfriend. Nevertheless, Grubitz, who is anxious to further his career, appoints Weisler to spy on the gentleman with his help. Weisler plants listening devices in Dreyman's apartment and begins shadowing the writer. As Weisler monitors Dreyman's daily life, however, he discovers the writer is one of the few East Germans who genuinely believes in his leaders. This changes over time, however, as Dreyman discovers that Christa-Maria is being blackmailed into a sexual relationship with Hempf, and one of Dreyman's friends, stage director Albert Jerska, is driven to suicide after himself being blackballed by the government. Dreyman's loyalty thus shifts away from the East German government, and he anonymously posts an anti-establishment piece in a major newspaper which rouses the fury of government officials. Meanwhile, Weisler becomes deeply emotionally drawn into the lives of Dreyman and Sieland, and becomes something of an anti-establishment figure himself, embracing freedom of thought and expression. The Lives of Others is the best German movie I have ever seen.It is a spy film like no other since it does not cater to car chases and action scenes but rather it focuses on character of the people in the story and character development.It is a a powerful but quiet film, constructed of hidden thoughts and secret desires but nevertheless,it is not short on suspense and tension that makes it truly one engaging and absorbing film.Inspite of its political themes and implications,I still find the movie more about humanity rather than the ideologies and anti- establishment beliefs presented in it.Added to the great qualities of the film,the cast delivers in their great performance.Overall,The Lives of Others is one unforgettable movie about the past history when Germany was divided into two nations with the East German people in particular.",10,3,3,5 November 2011

","Hellboy is a supernatural superhero movie.It stars Ron Perlman, John Hurt and Selma Blair together with Jeffrey Tambor,Rupert Evans and Brian Steele.The film is based on the Dark Horse Comics work Hellboy: Seed of Destruction by Mike Mignola. It is about a demonic beast known as Hellboy who secretly works to keep the world safe from paranormal threats.It was written and directed by Guillermo del Toro.Hellboy starts during World War II.The Third Reich has joined forces with the evil Grigori Rasputin,who has used his occult powers to summon up a young demon from the depth of Hell to be used as the ultimate Axis weapon. However, the demonic creature is captured by American forces, and put in the care of Professor Broom, the founder of a top-secret organization called the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense. Under Broom's tutelage, the creature develops empathy and a desire to do good while his physical powers and paranormal talents are honed to a fine point. Sixty years later, the demon, now known as Hellboy, is part of an elite secret defense team alongside Liz Sherman, a beautiful young woman who can create fire with her mind, and Abe Sapian,an aquatic humanoid with the power of telepathy. Despite his many years of fighting for right, Hellboy finds himself facing his greatest challenge when the powerful Rasputin returns, determined to bring the demon back to the forces of darkness so that evil may finally rule the world. Hellboy has wit, humor and fantastic visuals that makes it the entertaining.The viewer will be delighted by the surprisingly smart, graphically faithful live-action adaptation of the comic book series.But nevertheless,del Toro's screenplay provides somewhat a humanistic story into it that makes the movie not an exercise of special effects.Ron Perlman plays Hellboy with grit, humor, and a depth of feeling that makes the movie worth watching.Overall,Hellboy transcends its genre through del Toro's creative imagination.",8,1,1,5 November 2011
P.S. I Love You," Hillary Swank Is Miscast In This Romcom
","P.S. I Love You is a film directed by Richard LaGravenese. It stars Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler together with Lisa Kudrow,Gina Gershon,Jeffrey Dean Morgan,Kathy Bates,Harry Connick Jr. and Nellie McKay.It is about a A young widow who discovers that her late husband has left her 10 messages intended to help ease her pain and start a new life.The screenplay by LaGravenese and Steven Rogers is based on the novel of the same title by Cecelia Ahern. A grieving widow finds her husband's warmth radiating from the afterlife when she discovers that he left her a series of tasks to be revealed in ten monthly messages and designed to help her overcome her sorrow while gradually making the transition into a new life. Holly Kennedy is a New York real estate broker whose good-humored husband, Irishman Gerry, always stood by her side. Suddenly, and seemingly out of nowhere, Gerry succumbs to a brain tumor and Holly is left to face an uncertain future. No one in the world knows Holly better than Gerry, not even her mother or her best friends, Sharon and Denise. But while Holly remains unsure if she can go on without the love of her life to help guide her, Gerry has planned ahead. On Holly's 30th birthday, she receives a cake and a special tape recording from Gerry that implores her to get out and celebrate instead of staying in and mourning. Later, as the months wear on, a series of additional messages arrive from Gerry which is always delivered in the most remarkable and surprising of ways. With each new message comes a new adventure, and each letter signs off in the same familiar way: 'P.S. I love you.' Despite the fact that Holly's mother and friends think these humorous, posthumous messages are keeping Holly bound to the past, the truth is that they are lovingly guiding her into the future while proving that sometimes death isn't just the end, but a new beginning as well.Hilary Swank may have two Oscars, but P.S. I Love You proves she has plenty to learn about romantic comedies.Too bad that she was miscast in this film.Aside from that,it also happens to be just a standard romantic comedy that is clichéd,formulaic and average.It adds nothing to its genre and the screenplay has already been told many times in other movies.",8,1,2,1 October 2012
Good Will Hunting," Good Will Hunting Is Both Emotionally Rich And Entertaining
","Good Will Hunting is a film directed by Gus Van Sant that stars Matt Damon, Robin Williams, Ben Affleck, Minnie Driver, and Stellan Skarsgård.The story of the movie follows a 20-year-old South Boston laborer Will Hunting, a genius who is forced to see a therapist and study advanced mathematics with a renowned professor in order to avoid jail time.The story and screenplay were written by both by Affleck and Damon,who won the Oscar Best Original Screenplay for the film.The story was set in Boston and Cambridge, about rebellious 20-year-old MIT janitor Will Hunting,who is gifted with a photographic memory that hangs out with his South Boston bar buddies, his best friend Chuckie and his affluent British girlfriend Skylar.After MIT professor Lambeau stumps students with a challenging math formula on a hallway blackboard, Will anonymously leaves the correct solution, prompting Lambeau to track the elusive young genius. As Will's problems with the police escalate, Lambeau offers an out, but with two conditions namely: visits to a therapist and weekly math sessions. Will agrees to the latter but refuses to cooperate with a succession of therapists. Lambeau then contacts his former classmate, therapist Sean McGuire, an instructor at Bunker Hill Community College. Both are equally stubborn, but Will is finally forced to deal with both his past and his future.This is one of the best films in the 1990's that is both sincere and heartwarming especially when it presents the moving story of brilliant but troubled youth like Will Hunting.Also,the viewer gets to realize that beneath his arrogance and crass behavior, you'll find a lot of hurt and many defense mechanisms raised against a non-compassionate and manipulative society.Overall,it allows us to understand about Will Hunting's humanity rather than his gifts.The film was acted and directed extremely well.Damon and Williams were superb in their performance as Will Hunting and the psychiatrist respectively.Aside from that,the movie also gives the viewer a positive and inspirational experience especially if we get to understand what is beneath the character's persona.Overall,this is one excellent film that is emotionally rich and entertaining.",10,2,6,29 October 2011
Room," The Emotional Journey Of Joy And Jack
","The Academy Award gave the Best Actress Oscar to Brie Larson in this film about a young woman Joy who was imprisoned in a certain shed together with her five-year-old son Jack who was born in captivity by an old man entitled 'Room'.No question that many critics and viewers alike found it to be a wonderful film.Director Lenny Abrahamson provides an emotional journey of Joy as well as Jack and how she managed to use her intelligence,imagination and creativity to relieve herself of their situation especially in bringing up her son Jack inside the shed and how they cope and adapt to the outside world after being in captivity for many years.Jacob Tremblay,Joan Allen,Sean Bridgers and William H. Macy also stars in it. No question that it was touching movie during the first part of the film.We get to see how Joy to remedy their situation with the use of their imagination especially when Joy teaches many things about the world to Jack.Things become extremely difficult especially as Jack gets old and shows above average intelligence.At the beginning of the movie,we see the pain and suffering she has to go through as well as her determination to survive despite their situation.Being an overprotective mother,she also tries to satisfy sexually her captor Old Nick in exchange for their various items for her son. Luckily,they were able to remedy their situation and found a way to escape.While the movie was compelling the first part, the second part somehow fell short as it wasn't as interesting unlike when Joy and Jack were kept in the shed.When Joy reunited with her parents, I felt that the screenplay focused too on the emotional mother-and-daughter relationship between Joy and Jack and losing sight somewhat on the progress of the story as many issues were left for the audience to think about and discuss among themselves.That includes difficulties they are about to face upon adapting to the outside world after many years of captivity;how Joy's father is going to accept Jack knowing that it was fathered by Old Nick;how Joy is going to go on with her new life as woman in her 20's;and the difficulties Jack as a child is trying face to adapt to his 'new world' outside the shed.It would have been a masterpiece if not too many questions were left for the audience to answer and some issues were explored further for the continuation of the story.They could have at least shown a character development in both Joy and Jack from inside to outside the shed.Overall,Room was worth the price of admission despite the progress of the story was lacking in the second part after the escape.Both Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay captured the mother-and-daughter relationship perfectly.No question that Brie Larson deserved to win the Best Actress Oscar as the viewer will definitely empathize with her character Joy.Jacob Tremblay developed a wonderful chemistry with Larson although he could be annoying at times.He also showed strength emotionally to her mom especially in times of emotional pain and difficulties outside the shed.Their performances for me was so great that it somehow made me gave it the highest rating despite the second part.Finally,the viewers will definitely be touched with this movie experience especially for women around the world as the theme of motherhood was fully explored especially even in the most difficult and adverse circumstances.",10,1,4,19 January 2017
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," A Thrilling Film Epic
","The second film in Peter Jackson's series of screen adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien's internationally popular Lord of The Rings trilogy, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers literally begins where The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring ended, with the Fellowship splitting into three groups as they seek to return the Ring to Mordor, the forbidding land where the powerful talisman must be taken to be destroyed. This fantasy film directed by Jackson is based on the second volume of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. It is the second film in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, preceded by The Fellowship of the Ring and concluding with The Return of the King.Frodo,who carries the Ring, and his fellow Hobbit Sam are lost in the hills of Emyn Muil when they encounter Gollum, a strange creature who once carried the Ring and was twisted by its power. Gollum volunteers to guide the pair to Mordor; Frodo agrees, but Sam does not trust their new acquaintance. Elsewhere, Merry and Pippin are attempting to navigate Fangorn Forrest where they discover a most unusual nemesis -- Treebeard, a walking and talking tree-shepherd who doesn't much care for Hobbits. Finally, Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas arrive in Rohan to discover that the evil powers of Saruman have robbed King Theoden of his rule. The King's niece Éowyn believes Aragorn and his men have the strength to defeat Saruman, his henchman Wormtongue, and their minions. Éowyn soon becomes infatuated with Aragorn, while he struggles to stay faithful to the pledge of love he made to Arwen. Gandalf offers his help and encouragement as the Rohans, under Aragorn's leadership, attempt to face down Saruman's armies, but they soon discover how great the task before them truly is when they learn that his troops consist of 10,000 bloodthirsty creatures specially bred to fight to the death.The second chapter of Peter Jackson's seminal epic differs from the first in narrative and tone, there are more battle scenes and the mood is darker.But nevertheless,it was a wonderfully entertaining piece of filmmaking, filled with as much spectacle and wonder as any motion picture as compared to the first movie.It was outstanding but has very violent battle scenes.But still,what's remarkable is how immediately, after a full year, The Two Towers seizes your attention, and how urgently it holds you through three seamless, action-packed hours with a conclusion that makes you excited for the next film in the series.",10,1,3,12 January 2012
Schindler's List," Schindler's List Is The Greatest Film About The Holocaust
","Schindler's List is a film about Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who saved the lives of more than a thousand mostly Polish-Jewish refugees during the Holocaust by employing them in his factories.It stars Liam Neeson as Schindler,Ralph Fiennes as German officer Amon Göth,and Ben Kingsley as Schindler's Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern.The film was directed by Steven Spielberg which was based on the novel, Schindler's Ark by Thomas Keneally. In the movie,Schindler is a greedy German businessman.Then he becomes unlikely humanitarian amid his exposure of the barbaric Nazi reign when he feels compelled to turn his factory into a refuge for Jews. Based on the true story,he managed to save about 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp.Steven Spielberg rose to the occasion of directing the material by making sure that people do realize the horrors that the Jews have gone through during the Holocaust.It was simply a masterpiece.The use of black and white simply with simply touches of color like the girl in dress and the light of the candle provided what powerful emotions to the viewer.Evidently,the screenplay was sharply written for the movie was authentic and sincere in its presentation.The story was simply moving and uplifting when the goodness of men were shown just as it was disturbing and horrifying when graphic violence and cruelties of men towards others were displayed. The performances of the actors/actresses were simply fantastic.Neeson was excellent as Schindler,Kingsley was fantastic as Stern and most of all,Fiennes was real and horrifying like Goethe.The cast weren't over- the-top nor were they created like movie characters,but they were treated in the film like human beings with both positive and negative traits.

","Across the Universe is a musical romantic drama film directed by Julie Taymor, produced by Revolution Studios, and distributed by Columbia Pictures.It stars Evan Rachel Wood, Jim Sturgess, Joe Anderson and T. V. Carpio, and introduces Dana Fuchs and Martin Luther McCoy as actors. Cameo appearances are made by Bono, Eddie Izzard, Joe Cocker, Salma Hayek amongst others.The film's plot is centered around songs by The Beatles. The script is based on an original story credited to Taymor, Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais. It incorporates 34 compositions originally written by members of The Beatles.Set against the anti-war protests, rock & roll revolution, and mind- expanding psychedelia of the 1960s,the hallucinogenic musical follows the arduous journey of star-crossed lovers Jude (Sturgess) and Lucy (Wood) as they and a small group of musicians are swept up in the raging waters of the volatile counterculture movement. Guided through their journey by a pair known only as Dr. Robert and Mr. Kite, Jude and Lucy are eventually forced to find their way back to one another after being split apart by powerful forces beyond their control.The film tries to tell a story of young love and 1960s war protest accompanied by the Lennon-McCartney catalog.Although the movie does great justice in the Beatles music,it fails miserably in telling the audience a great story and setting its point across due to excessive visuals.But nevertheless,anyone who isn't even a Beatles fan would great enjoy this movie and appreciate their music.",9,1,2,8 September 2012
The Elephant Man," A David Lynch Masterpiece And Must-See
","The Elephant Man is a drama based on the true story of Joseph Merrick,who is called John Merrick in the film and a severely deformed man in 19th century London. The film was directed by David Lynch and the screenplay was adapted by Lynch, Christopher De Vore, and Eric Bergren from the books namely: The Elephant Man and Other Reminiscences by Sir Frederick Treves and The Elephant Man: A Study in Human Dignity by Ashley Montagu. It was shot in black-and-white and it stars John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins. Anne Bancroft, John Gielgud, Wendy Hiller, Michael Elphick, Hannah Gordon, and Freddie Jones co-star to play key supporting roles.It was shot in black-and-white.Treated as a sideshow freak, Merrick is assumed to be retarded as well as misshapen because of his inability to speak coherently. In fact, he is highly intelligent and sensitive, a fact made public when one Dr. Frederick Treves rescues Merrick from a carnival and brings him to a hospital for analysis. Alas, even after being recognized as a man of advanced intellect, Merrick is still treated like a freak; no matter his station in life, he will forever be a prisoner of his own malformed body.You could only see his eyes behind the layers of makeup, but those expressive orbs earned John Hurt a well-deserved Oscar nomination for his moving portrayal of John Merrick.Lynch's relatively straight second feature finds an admirable synthesis of compassion and restraint in treating its subject, and features outstanding performances by the cast.Added to that,it exposes undercurrents of anguish along with an emotionally accessible tale of Merrick's nobility which is characterized by a Victorian morality play disguised as an elegy to freakishness.Also,it includes includes several benchmarks from Lynch such hissing noises, nightmare sequences, and moments of deadly quiet which makes it is a masterpiece and a must-see.",10,2,4,24 October 2012
The Bourne Legacy," A Good Addition To The Bourne Movie Franchise
","The Bourne Legacy is an action thriller film directed that are based on Robert Ludlum's Jason Bourne novels. It is the fourth installment in the series. The film stars Jeremy Renner, Rachel Weisz, and Edward Norton together with franchise veterans Albert Finney, Joan Allen, David Strathairn and Scott Glenn. Tony Gilroy, co-screenwriter of the first three films, sought to continue the story of the film series without changing its events and directed the movie. Aaron Cross is a member of Operation Outcome,a US Defense Department black ops program which employs pills referred to as chems that enhance the physical and mental abilities of field operatives. Cross is assigned to Alaska for a training exercise, where he must survive certain activities and traverse rugged terrain in order to arrive at a remote cabin. The cabin is operated by an exiled Outcome operative, Number Three, who informs Cross that he broke the mission record by two days. Meanwhile, a British reporter who was writing on operations Treadstone and Blackbriar is assassinated. The Blackbriar and Treadstone programs are publicly exposed, leading the FBI and the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to investigate CIA Director Ezra Kramer, Deputy Director Pamela Landy, Blackbriar supervisor Noah Vosen, and Treadstone clinical researcher Dr Albert Hirsch. Kramer requests help from Eric Byer, a retired US Air Force colonel responsible for overseeing the CIA's clandestine operations. Byer discovers a potentially damaging video on the internet in which the lead researchers for Treadstone and Outcome appear together at professional functions in public. To prevent the Treadstone investigation from finding out about Outcome, Byer decides to shut Outcome down and kill its agents. He sees the sacrifice as acceptable because the government has separately initiated next-generation beta programs, including the supersoldier program LARX.Byer deploys a UAV to eliminate Number Three and Cross.Cross hears the drone's approach and leaves moments before a missile destroys the cabin with Number Three inside.The Bourne Legacy is by no means a bad film. Unfortunately, it just has trouble living up to the real world Jason Bourne 'legacy.'It couldn't ever hope to match the Paul Greengrass/Matt Damon movies for sheer punch and propulsion, but it's as close to replicating them as you could expect, and marks another excellent entry into the Bourne movie franchise.It may not be the thriller the first three films managed to be but it's well written and very entertaining.",9,3,6,6 April 2013
22 Jump Street," Funnier And Better Than 21 Jump Street
","22 Jump Street is an action comedy that is a sequel to film 21 Jump Street,based on the television series of the same name.It stars Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum together with the beauteous Amber Stevens,Jillian Bell and Ice Cube.After their success in the 21 Jump Street program,Schmidt and Jenko are back on the streets once again in pursuit of drug dealers led by Ghost.However,they fail once again in their mission that Deputy Chief Hardy puts them back into the program now known as 22 Jump Street headed by Captain Dickson.Their new assignment to go undercover as college students and locate the supplier of a drug known as 'WHYPHY'.This sequel is written by Michael Bacall, Oren Uziel, and Rodney Rothman; and directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller.Jenko and Schmidt go deep undercover at a local college to locate the supplier of 'WHYPHY'.Jenko meets a kindred spirit on the football team while Schmidt infiltrates the bohemian art major scene.As they try to solve the case,their partnership becomes an issue as maturity and their transformation from young looking men into real men as undercover college students.Also coming into the picture is Jenko's relationship with Maya,who unknowingly happens to be Captain Dickinson's daughter.Just like the predecessor,Hill and Tatum manage to make their characters appealing and entertaining.Their odd partnership - one being a nerd and the other being idiot/athletic - still provides a lot of fun as it remains refreshing and entertaining.They were able to provide added new vibe to their relationship that the viewer will find compelling.In addition to that,it is a funnier comedy as the sequel did not fall into the trap of relying on the previous elements of the predecessor that made it successful.What made it better is that it managed to made fun of its lack of creativity and despite the fact that its humor is mostly slapstick,crude and sexual, it does not suffer from lack of intelligence.Overall,it is even funnier and better than its predecessor. No wonder 23 Jump Street is in development while this review is being written.",10,1,4,21 March 2015
Dog Day Afternoon," A Bank Robbery Turned Media Circus
","Al Pacino starred in four films prior to this film namely: The Panic In The Needle Park,The Godfather,Serpico and The Godfather Part II. Apparently,it was in his fourth starring picture,Dog Day Afternoon is where he got his real confidence on-screen.It was in this picture that cemented his place in Hollywood for the next forty years as one of the greatest actors not only in his generation but of the industry by playing the role of Sonny Wortzik,a complex bisexual bank robber in this film.Dog Day Afternoon is a film inspired by P.F. Kluge's article that tells a story of the robbery of a Brooklyn bank by John Wojtowicz and Salvatore Naturile in 1972.It stars Al Pacino together with John Cazale, Charles Durning, Chris Sarandon and Carol Kane.The movie was directed by Sidney Lumet,who this around time allowed Al Pacino release his acting abilities and potential to the fullest after working together initially in a film before entitled,Serpico.Dog Day Afternoon chronicles a unique bank robbery on a hot summer afternoon in New York City. Shortly before closing time, scheming loser Sonny and his slow-witted buddy, Sal,played by excellently John Cazale,burst into a Brooklyn bank for what should be a run-of-the-mill robbery, but everything goes wrong, beginning with the fact that there is almost no money in the bank. The situation swiftly escalates, as Sonny and Sal take hostages; enough cops to police the tristate area surround the bank; a large Sonny-sympathetic crowd gathers to watch; the media arrive to complete the circus; and police captain Moretti,portrayed by Charles Durning,tries to negotiate with Sonny while keeping the volatile spectacle under control. When Sonny's lover, Leon that was portrayed by Chris Sarandon, tries to talk Sonny out of the bank, we learn the robbery's motive: to finance Leon's sex-change operation. Sonny demands a plane to escape, but the end is near once menacingly cool FBI agent Sheldon arrives to take over the negotiations.The movie had great performances.That is true especially from Pacino,who showed intense acting and complex emotions as Sonny.He showed varied emotions as a bumbling first time bank robber,a loving bisexual who showed concerned to both his wife and his lover,an intelligent strategist and most of all,a hysterical human being.He definitely portrayed his role as realistically as possible that an Oscar nomination was only deserving. The same is true with Sarandon,who garnered also an Academy Award nomination for their portrayal in the film.Aside from that,Lumet's excellent and outstanding direction was just worth of the mention.Aside from the performances,the themes touched by the movie was also in cohesion and were never out of place inspite of its variety such as homosexuality,a bank robbery media circus,people wanting to be shown live on TV,family and sex transplant.The screenplay by Frank Pierson was able to put everything together in one marvelous story that he truly deserves of an Oscar for that movie.Dog Day Afternoon just deserves its place as one of the best films not only in the decade it was released but of all-time just as Pacino cemented his place as one of the best actors in history.",10,4,6,22 October 2011
Amadeus," A Great Film About Mozart
","Amadeus is a period drama film directed by Milo Forman and written by Peter Shaffer. Adapted from Shaffer's stage play Amadeus, the story is a variation of Alexandr Pushkin's play Mozart i Salieri, in which the composer Antonio Salieri recognizes the genius of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart but thwarts him out of envy. The story is set in Vienna, Austria, during the latter half of the 18th century.Amadeus is an expansion of a Viennese 'urban legend' concerning the death of 18th century musical genius Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. From the vantage point of an insane asylum, aging royal composer Salieri recalls the events of three decades earlier, when the young Mozart first gained favor in the court of Austrian emperor Joseph II. Salieri was incensed that God would bless so vulgar and obnoxious a young snipe as Mozart with divine genius. Why was Salieri -- so disciplined, so devoted to his art, and so willing to toady to his superiors -- not touched by God? Unable to match Mozart's talent, Salieri uses his influence in court to sabotage the young upstart's career. Disguising himself as a mysterious benefactor, Salieri commissions the backbreaking Requiem, which eventually costs Mozart his health, wealth, and life. Among the film's many pearls of dialogue, the best line goes to the emperor, who rejects a Mozart composition on the grounds that it has 'too many notes.'It is arguably the best motion picture ever made about the process of creation and the creator.On a production level and as an evocation of a time and place, Amadeus is loaded with pleasures for Reminds us that movies can be lyrical as well as vulgar, ambitious as well as playful, brilliant as well as down and dirty. As Mozart, Tom Hulce, though extremely American in looks and voice, gets better and better as the drama progresses.Overall,it was a lavish, entertaining, powerful film about the life and influence, both positive and negative, of one of Western culture's great artists.",10,1,2,6 March 2012
Kick-Ass," A Good Superhero Film
","Kick-Ass is a superhero comedy based on the comic book of the same title by Mark Millar and John Romita, Jr. It tells the story of an ordinary teenager, Dave Lizewski, who sets out to become a real-life superhero. It was directed by Matthew Vaughn. The main character is geeky high-school student Dave Lizewski, who finds himself wondering why no-one has ever tried to be a real-life superhero. After turning himself into a ridiculously skinny streak of green and yellow named Kick-Ass - all he needed was a wetsuit ordered online - Dave takes to the streets to take on some bad guys. And subsequently takes a beating that almost kills him.Unbelievably, after a lengthy period of recuperation, Dave brings back Kick-Ass for another assignment. This time around, he is more successful, if not exactly effective.After someone posts a YouTube clip of a disguised Dave clumsily overpowering some muggers, the cult of Kick-Ass goes viral.Among those watching with extreme interest are two other amateur costumed crazies : the dynamically deranged father-daughter duo of Big Daddy and Hit-Girl. So mob boss Frank D'Amico had better watch out. He too is distracted by the sudden emergence of Kick-Ass, mistakenly thinking the mystery do-gooder poses a serious threat to his operations. While Frank dispatches his wimpy son to become Red Mist, a possible sidekick for Kick-Ass, Big Daddy and Hit-Girl move closer to executing the ultimate act of revenge. For the most part Kick-Ass is witty, knowing and hugely fun.With its electrifying action sequences, a killer storyline and a maverick comic sensibility, the brilliance of the film will surely astound the viewer. The performances are excellent.In addition to that, the breakneck pacing does not diminish the intense impact achieved by some spectacularly splatter-some combat scenes.Also,the screenplay is incredibly well- written, simultaneously sending-up and shredding the superhero genre, while never under-playing the mere mortality of its own characters. This is certainly worth the price of admission.",10,2,2,22 August 2013
Ghostbusters," Bringing Me Back To It After The All-Female Version Was Released
","Hollywood made a 2016 version of the 'Ghostbusters' with an all-female cast that were SNL performers. This led me back to the original version in 1984 and apparently,I was surprised to know that I haven't reviewed it yet despite having seen it many times since the year it was released. Before the review,this is a little information about the movie.Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson lead the cast as a quartet of 'paranormal investigators'. This led them to these career as three of them ran out of government grants and hired the fourth member of the group. They were tasked New York to run out the ghoulies, ghosts,ghosties, and long-legged beasties. Later,they were hired to run out an army of unfriendly spirits as well as a long-dead Babylonian demon.At the conclusion,we get to see a glorious army of monsters battling against the so-called ghostbusters.No question that this was a great comedy involving ghosts instead of horror films.Added to that,we also see a great performance from Bill Murray. His one-liners were definitely a delight to hear. Despite the fact that the special effects are obsolete by the present standards as it was released more than three decades ago, the movie still holds up for present audience to enjoy. In fact,it is even better than the all-female version released three years ago.",10,4,4,9 December 2019
Coyote Ugly," A Feel Good Dramedy
","Coyote Ugly stars Piper Perabo and Adam Garcia together with Maria Bello,Izabella Miko,Bridget Moynahan,Tyra Banks and John Goodman.It is romantic dramedy about an aspiring musician from New Jersey who tries her luck in New York becomes a bartender.Violet Sanford dreams of making a name for herself as a singer and songwriter.She move to New York to make a name for herself but she found out that it won't be an easy journey towards it as her music is constantly rejected by music producers.This temporarily led her to becoming a one of the attractive female bartenders at Coyote Ugly that flaunt their skin while dancing and serving drinks to the male customers.She also finds a new boyfriend in Kevin O'Donnell.As the story goes on,we see Violet get into many problems and conflicts with bar owner Lil,Kevin,her father,her fellow barmaids and having stage fright when performing.But in the end,she manages to overcome these obstacles and her dreams ultimately come true.As always,there is nothing refreshing and groundbreaking in it as we have seen the plot elements in it in previous movies.The story was definitely clichéd and predictable as the viewer can see how everything will come out for Violet in the end.The only thing I could say is that it definitely will provide enjoyment to the male viewers especially when the attractive barmaids show parts of their skin while dancing and it also would be a form of a stress reliever for people looking to relax while watching it.Added to that,it can also be form of an escapism as well as feeling good which it does effectively.But viewers looking for an intelligent film should stay away from it for they will feel disappointed.",6,1,2,14 September 2014
Gran Torino," Gran Torino Is Another Clint Eastwood Masterpiece
","Gran Torino is a film that is that stars Clint Eastwood. The film marks Eastwood's return to a lead acting role after four years, his previous leading role having been in Million Dollar Baby, and Eastwood has stated that this is his final film as an actor although there are rumors that he is set to appear in Trouble With A Curve with Amy Adams,which is scheduled to be released in 2013.The film features a large Hmong American cast such as Bee Vang,Ahney Her,Doua Moua and Sonny Vue together with Christopher Carley,Brian Haley,Brian Howe and Geraldine Hughes.It was written by Nick Schenk and produced as well as directed by Eastwood himself.Clint Eastwood's allegedly final film centers on a racist Korean War veteran named Walt Kowalski,who living in a crime-ridden Detroit neighborhood,is forced to confront his own lingering prejudice when a troubled Hmong teen from his neighborhood attempts to steal his prized Gran Torino.Decades after the Korean War has ended, aging veteran Walt is still haunted by the horrors he witnessed on the battlefield. The two objects that matter most to Kowalski in life are the classic Gran Torino that represents his happier days working in a Ford assembly plant, and the M- 1 rifle that saved his life countless times during combat. When Kowalski's teenage neighbor attempts to steal his Gran Torino as part of a gang initiation rite, the old man manages to catch the aspiring thief at the business end of his well-maintained semi-automatic rifle. Later, due to the pride of the Asian group, the boy is forced to return to Kowalski's house and perform an act of penance. Despite the fact that Kowalski wants nothing to do with the young troublemaker, he realizes that the quickest way out of the situation is to simply cooperate. In an effort to set the teen on the right path in life and toughen him up, the reluctant vet sets him up with an old crony who now works in construction. In the process, Kowalski discovers that the only way to lay his many painful memories to rest is to finally face his own blinding prejudice head-on.In this film,Clint Eastwood finally provides not another revenge fantasies which his characters portray in the earlier parts of his character.It presents a different theme about the futility of revenge,the non-promotion of act of violence and the healing power of forgiveness.Aside from that,it also tells a story of an aging person who tries to become a better father by teaching a young Hmong teen-ager named Thao about the ways of life.It also tells a story of a man how he overcomes both his racist attitude towards others and the war experiences that have both wounded and affected him emotionally during the war.In short,the film was a humorous, touching, and intriguing old- school parable about an old man.Aside from its great story,the performance of Eastwood is definitely worth mentioning as he has proved at age 78,he still can command a great screen presence and can look credible as a movie hero.It was definitely a wonderful film that could be another classified as a cinema masterpiece that would be a fitting finale for long and illustrious career of a legendary movie actor.",10,2,5,2 December 2011
K-19: The Widowmaker," Another Good Submarine Film
","A real-life historical incident becomes the basis for this military thriller from director Kathryn Bigelow that's reminiscent of such submarine dramas as Das Boot, The Hunt for Red October, Crimson Tide, and U-571 in this film,K-19: The Widowmaker.It stars Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson together with Peter Sarsgaard,,Joss Ackland and John Shrapnel. The screenplay was adapted by Christopher Kyle, based on a story written by Louis Nowra.Captain Alexi Vostrikov is a Russian naval officer who's being given command of the Soviet Union's first nuclear submarine, K-19, at the height of the Cold War in 1961. The vessel's previous commander, Captain Mikhail Polenin has been demoted to executive officer following a botched test and his outspoken assertions that the flagship is not yet ready for deployment, but he curbs his resentment and resolves to serve his new superior well. The former commander has concerns that are well founded: parts are not yet installed, equipment is missing, and the ship's doctor is killed in an auto mishap. Political pressure forces Vostrikov to sail his crew into the North Atlantic anyway, for a missile fire test that serves as a warning to the U.S. that its enemy is now its technological equal. The test is a success, but a disastrous leak in the K-19's reactor cooling system soon threatens to create enough heat to detonate the craft's nuclear payload wherein would certainly be mistaken for the first salvo in a worldwide atomic exchange and spark the beginning of World War III. With no other option, Vostrikov orders his men to repair the damage in ten-minute shifts, irradiating them hopelessly. The conflict between the seemingly bureaucratic Communist Vostrikov and the more humane Polenin escalates, until a surprising twist reveals where both officers' loyalties truly lie.This is a gripping drama even though the filmmakers have taken liberties with the real facts.Also,it can be considered a brutally effective and brilliantly constructed dramatic thriller wherein intense wartime submarine movie celebrates heroism.This is also a taut, skillfully- executed film anchored by two rock-solid leading men in Ford and Neeson as well as talented director in Bigelow.Overall,it makes the audience care for Soviets who are trapped between a rock and a hard place deep beneath the sea.",9,2,3,25 September 2012

","'Moulin Rouge!' is a romantic Jukebox musical that tells the story of a young, English poet/writer, Christian, who falls in love with the terminally-ill star of the Moulin Rouge, cabaret actress and courtesan Satine. It stars Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgregor together with Jim Broadbent,Richard Roxburgh,John Leguizamo,Jacek Koman and Caroline O'Connor.The film was loosely based on the opera Orpheus in the Underworld It was directed, produced, and co-written by Baz Luhrmann.Christian leaves behind his bourgeois father during the French belle époque of the late 1890's to seek his fortunes in the bohemian underworld of Montmartre, Paris. Christian meets the absinthe- and alcohol-addicted artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, who introduces him to a world of sex, drugs, music, theater, and the scandalous dance known as the cancan, all at the Moulin Rouge, a decadent dance hall, brothel, and theater that's the brainchild of Harold Zidler. Christian also meets and falls into a tragically doomed romance with the courtesan Satine, who becomes the star of the play he's writing, which parallels the couple's romance and utilizes rock music from a century later.This film is a tour de force of artifice, a dazzling pastiche of musical and visual elements at the service of a blatantly artificial story.It is all style, all giddy, over-the-top spectacle but nevertheless, it's also daring in its vision and wildly original.It is overall a 'love-it-or- hate-it experience' for the viewer.",9,1,2,3 October 2012

Slap Shot," Slap Shot Is One Great Sports Comedy And Social Commentary
","Slap Shot is a film that depicts the Charlestown Chiefs,a minor league hockey team that resorts to violent play to gain popularity in a declining factory town.It stars Paul Newman in a wonderful comic performance together with Strother Martin,Michael Ontkean,Lindsay Crouse and the famously known 'Hanson Brothers' namely David Hanson,Steve Carlson and Jeff Carlson.The plot has Newman play Reggie Dunlop, the coach of a pathetic minor- league American hockey team,Charlestown Chiefs. His career at a standstill and his marriage in tatters, Dunlop has nothing to lose by taking on a new group of players who are one evolutionary step above Neanderthals - the Hanson Brothers namely Jack,Steve and Jeff.Only when the team begins winning does he decide to get behind these players, and to encourage the rest of the team to play as down-and-dirty as the newcomers. Straight-arrow team member Ned Braden,played by Michael Ontkean,resents this influx of gonzo talent, preferring to play clean. As the film's multitude of subplots play themselves out, Dunlop does his best to keep the outraged Braden on the team. To keep them motivated, Dunlop plants a story with sportswriter Dickie Dunn that the Chiefs are being sold to a prospective buyer in Florida. The owner turns out to be a rich widow who couldn't care less about hockey. She intends to fold the Chiefs and take a tax write-off. Disgusted with her, he storms out, and realizes that his lies blew up in his face. One last playoff game remains, and Dunlop reveals to the players that there is no buyer and he made the whole story up. After apologizing to his team, he decides that this is to be his last game, so Reggie wants to go out with dignity and not like a goon. Despite being conned, the team follows Dunlop's lead and vows to play clean.Unfortunately,the fight ensues later in the game.Braden, sulking on the bench after refusing to goon it up, finally snaps. He skates out to center ice and strips off his uniform. Both teams stop fighting and stare in amazement at Braden's striptease, hypocritically more offended by Braden's antics than the violence they have been engaging in.Slap Shot has become a cult classic especially among Hockey fans.Its nonstop barrage of profanity and its raunchy action sequences are of such intensity is probably what the movie will be remembered for.But it is more than just a comedic film for it is about a man, a town, a team, a league and a sport that are all dying, and Hill has created characters who are desperate, selfish, lonely, deceitful and violent.As for the themes or should I say 'dark' themes of the film,it was basically a social commentary about the attitude of 'winning at all cost';the power of the media;the Americans'love for sports and their fascination for violence as professed for the sport of hockey; and a view to the world of capitalism.Aside from that,it also touches on broken marriages, selfishness, manipulation and deceit, sports-fan blood lust, battle between players and team owners and the effects of an economic downturn to a blue- collar town. George Hill created an absorbing flick that is frank,violent and extremely hilarious and the same time that states something about our society.It was one of the greatest sports comedy I have seen in my life.It was raunchy,violent and very funny.Slap Shot will rank among the best sports comedies and social commentaries ever made in cinema.",10,2,3,25 October 2011
Back to the Future Part III," Provides Utter Joy At Present Just Like When It Was Initially Released
","The final installment in the Back to the Future trilogy picks up where the second film left off, but it casts off the dizzying time travel of the first two films for mostly routine comedy set in the Old West.This science fiction comedy was directed by Robert Zemeckis and starred Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Mary Steenburgen, Thomas F. Wilson, and Lea Thompson. It takes place immediately after the events of Back to the Future Part II. While stranded in 1955, Marty McFly discovers that his friend Dr. Emmett 'Doc' Brown was killed by Biff Tannen's great- grandfather Buford. Marty decides to travel to 1885 to rescue Doc and return to his own time line.In the movie,Marty McFly receives a 70-year-old letter from his inventor friend, Doc Brown, who tells Marty that he has retreated a century in time to live out a relatively quiet life in the Old West. Doc Brown reveals that he hid his DeLorean car/time machine in an abandoned mine outside town, and when Marty does some research and discovers that the Doc died shortly after writing the letter, he decides to find the car, travel back in time, and warn the Doc about his demise. Meanwhile, the Doc, who has fallen in love with a local woman, realizes he can't hide in the past from the problems he has caused to the time flow in the previous two adventures. He reluctantly decides to return to the present with Marty, but first, they have to find a way to get the DeLorean up to time-travel velocity with a broken fuel line and no gasoline. The simplicity of plot, and the wide expansiveness of its use of space, are a refreshing change from the convoluted, visually cramped and cluttered second part.Also,this is a good deal more likable because the product plugs have been held back, and Zemeckis is clearly having fun alluding to his favorite westerns; there's also a certain sweetness and charm in the Lloyd-Steenburgen romance.In addition to that,it avoids many of the previous sequel's narrative and logical pitfalls and reengages more successfully with the simple, direct pleasures that made the first film such a hit. It was an utter joy in 1990 when it was released and again when the viewer watches it at present.",9,4,4,24 October 2012
The Illusionist," A Fantastic Film
","The Illusionist is a period drama that features Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti, and Jessica Biel. It is based loosely on Steven Millhauser's short story, 'Eisenheim the Illusionist'. The film tells the story of Eisenheim, a magician in fin de siècle Vienna, who uses his abilities to secure the love of a woman far above his social standing.It was written and directed by Neil Burger.A supernaturally talented magician attempts to undermine the rigid social structure of turn-of-the-century Vienna by using his powers to win the love of his upper-class, childhood sweetheart. Though the ill- fated childhood romance between cabinetmaker's son Eisenheim and upper- class Sophie von Teschen eventually resulted in the heartbroken young man leaving Austria to explore the world, his dreams of one day reuniting with the beautiful duchess never faded. Upon returning to Vienna 15 years later as a talented and renowned illusionist, Eisenheim's hopes of a reunion seem dashed when he learns that Sophie is currently engaged to the Crown Prince Leopold. As the tensions between the Eisenheim and Leopold elevate, urbane Chief Inspector Uhl finds his sympathy toward Eisenheim growing, despite his formal obligations to the powerful prince.First screened in Europe and scheduled for limited release in the U.S., The movie offers welcome proof that 'arthouse' quality needn't be limited to the art houses. Set in turn-of-the-century Vienna, this stately, elegant period film benefited from a crossover release in mainstream cinemas, and showed considerable box-office staying power and the allure of Jessica Biel, who rises to the occasion with a fine performance. But there's equal appeal in the casting of Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti, who bring their formidable talents to bear on the intriguing tale of a celebrated magician.Overall,it was a engrossing, well-crafted story of mystery, magic and intrigue that is certain to enchant and entertain the viewer.",9,2,4,28 September 2012

Kevin Hart,Alan Arkin and Kim Basinger co-stars and Peter Segal directed it.Pittsburgh pugilists Henry 'Razor' Sharp and Billy 'The Kid' McDonnen become boxing rivals after two fights.In their first fight,Kid beats Razor.But in their rematch,it was Razor's turn to beat Kid. Unfortunately,the third fight did not happen when Razor announces his retirement putting a sudden end to their rivalry.Years later, Razor is working in a shipyard when he's visited by promoter Dante Slate Jr., who wants to capture him on a performance for a video game. Razor accepts the money to pay his bills,help for the expenses of his ailing former- trainer and renovate his home. At the recording studio, he is surprised by Kid, who was also invited by Slate. But on their first meeting after three decades,their hatred for each other erupts into an unintentionally hilarious melee that instantly goes viral. This transforms renews their rivalry and becomes a must-see boxing match and an HBO event. Their training,the friction between them,their involvement in a love triangle,and the reunion of Sharp and Sally Rose becomes central to the story.Unlike Rocky and Raging Bull,this comedic film is definitely far from an Oscar winner.It was definitely made for a few laughs.Also,we get to see a mediocre and cliché ridden story with a few corny scenes and lifeless drama.Performances were okay.But I have to mention that Stallone manages to be effective with the underdog role as Sharp the same way he did as Rocky.Despite getting nominated for a Razzie,I felt that viewers will definitely cheer for him in the concluding boxing match.Added to that,it also provides older generation with the nostalgic moments when references from lead stars' iconic roles were made in the film.Sharp's training provided references for Rocky like drinking a glass of egg yolks,jogging in the streets and almost punches meat in an abattoir.The Kid's stand comedy lounge act,sarcastic attitude and being a smart ass provides a nod to LaMotta.In summary,it is definitely fun and entertaining if one isn't oblivious to the fact that both lead stars never made this film to honor their previous iconic roles that many fans of the world revere but to have fun with them.",8,2,3,9 May 2014
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," A Great Anime With An Eco-Message
","Hayao Miyazaki gained widespread attention in Japan for his complex ecological manga series, Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind in 1982, which he adapted for the screen two years later in 1984. This animated post-apocalyptic fantasy adventure is written and directed by Miyazaki and it is based on his manga of the same name. The film features the voices of Sumi Shimamoto, Goro Naya, Yoji Matsuda, Yoshiko Sakakibara and Iemasa Kayumi.It tells the story of Nausicaä, a young princess of the Valley of the Wind who gets involved in a struggle with Tolmekia, a kingdom that tries to use an ancient weapon to eradicate a jungle of mutant giant insects. Nausicaä must stop the Tolmekians from enraging these creatures.Centuries after war has devastated the earth, Princess Nausicaa leads the people of the Valley of the Wind. Feuding clans fight with planes and tanks as well as swords in a world that is both primitive and futuristic. In addition to her people's conflicts with other factions, Nausicaa must also contend with the insects of the jungle including the Ohmu, a race of giant, intelligent bugs that poisons the surrounding atmosphere and is spreading rapidly. Nausicaa is more concerned with harmony and communication than with conquest and revenge. Sympathetic to the Ohmu, she learns she must approach them with understanding to achieve peace and restore the dying world.This film is beautifully animated and written, and the moral to this ecological fable is difficult to miss. It is in some ways a grim and serious but it mixes a sweet optimism into its horror-filled lessons.Aside from that,it enjoys a visual richness and narrative ambition virtually unheard of in animation prior to its release on screen.Overall,it is a must-see anime.",10,1,3,24 October 2012
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," An Epic Fantasy Drama Film
","The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a fantasy-drama film directed by David Fincher. The screenplay by Eric Roth and Robin Swicord is loosely based on the 1922 short story of the same name by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The film stars Brad Pitt as a man who ages in reverse and Cate Blanchett as the love interest throughout his life.What makes Button such a curious case is that when he is born in New Orleans just after World War I, he is already in his eighties, and proceeds to live his life aging in reverse. This sweeping film follows the character's unusual life into the 21st century as he experiences joy and sadness, loves lost and found, and the meaning of timelessness.Tilda Swinton, Elias Koteas, and Julia Ormond co-stars.In 2005, Daisy, an elderly woman, is on her deathbed in a New Orleans hospital. Daisy asks her daughter, Caroline, to read aloud from the diary of Benjamin Button.In 1918, Mr. Gateau, a blind New Orleans clockmaker, loses his son on the battlefields of France in World War I. As a way to deal with the grief, Gateau builds a large clock for the New Orleans train station, but fixes it so that the time goes in reverse. When asked why, Gateau states that maybe time will reverse and the men lost in the war— including his son—might come home again.On the evening of November 11, 1918, a boy is born with the appearance and physical maladies of a very elderly man. The baby's mother dies shortly after giving birth, and the father, Thomas Button, abandons the infant on the porch of a nursing home. Queenie and Mr. 'Tizzy' Weathers, who work at the nursing home, find the baby, and Queenie decides to care for him as her own.In 1930, 12-year-old Benjamin, having exchanged a wheelchair for crutches, befriends six-year-old Daisy, whose grandmother lives in the nursing home. As Benjamin's body grows younger, he accepts work on a tugboat. Benjamin also meets Thomas Button, who does not reveal that he is Benjamin's father. In 1936, Benjamin leaves New Orleans with the tugboat crew for a long-term work engagement. He eventually finds himself in Murmansk, where he starts an affair with Elizabeth Abbott, wife of the British Trade Minister.In 1941, while the tugboat crew is still in Russia, Japan attacks the U.S. at Pearl Harbor thrusting America into World War II. Mike, the captain, volunteers the boat to be a ship in the U.S. Navy and the crew is assigned to scrap collection duty. During a patrol, the tugboat stumbles upon a sunken U.S. transport and the bodies of hundreds of American troops. While surveying the carnage, a German submarine surfaces. Knowing his duty Mike steers the tugboat full speed towards the sub while a German gunner fires on the tugboat killing most of the crew including Mike. The tugboat rams the submarine causing it to explode sinking both vessels. The next day Benjamin and one other crew member are picked up by ships of the U.S. Navy.In 1945, Benjamin returns to New Orleans, and learns that 21-year-old Daisy has become a successful ballet dancer. Benjamin again crosses paths with Thomas Button, who, terminally ill, reveals that he is Benjamin's father. Thomas wills Benjamin his possessions before he dies. Daisy's dance career is ended in Paris in 1957, when she is hit by a taxi cab and breaks her leg. When Benjamin goes to see her, Daisy is amazed at his youthful appearance, but frustrated at her own injuries; she tells him to stay out of her life. In 1962, Daisy returns to New Orleans and reunites with Benjamin. Now of comparable physical age, they fall in love and move in together.Daisy gives birth to a girl, Caroline in 1968. Benjamin, believing he cannot be a father figure to his daughter due to his reverse aging, sells his belongings and leaves the proceeds to Daisy and Caroline. He travels the world alone during the 1970s.Benjamin, appearing to be in his early twenties, returns to Daisy in 1980. Now re-married, Daisy introduces Benjamin to her husband and daughter as a family friend. Daisy then visits Benjamin at his hotel, where they share their passion for each other. Daisy admits that Benjamin was right to leave; she could not have coped otherwise. Benjamin departs again.In 1991, widowed Daisy receives a phone call from social workers. They have found Benjamin — now apparently about 12 years old — living in a condemned building, and have contacted her because they found her name in his diary. The bewildered social workers say that his condition resembles dementia. Daisy moves into the nursing home where Benjamin grew up and takes care of him as he becomes increasingly younger until, physically, he becomes an infant once more. In 2003, he dies in Daisy's arms remembering who she was. Benjamin's story now told, Daisy dies in her New Orleans hospital bed, as Hurricane Katrina approaches.It was a critically acclaimed film that went on to receive thirteen Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor for Pitt, and Best Supporting Actress for Taraji P. Henson. It won three Oscars, for Art Direction, Makeup, and Visual Effects.It was an epic fantasy tale with rich storytelling backed by fantastic performances led by Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett.David Fincher's epic doesn't wallow in nihilistic obsessions, but preached no comforting homily about life's rich pageant either. Life is feel-good in spurts - a series of oddly interconnected, occasionally elating moments that accumulate before death.The only thing about it is it was a bit long at almost 3 hours.Nevertheless,it does not fail to entertain and satisfy any viewer.",10,1,2,5 January 2012
Pawn Sacrifice," A Watchable Movie About Bobby Fisher
","Pawn Sacrifice is a biographical film based on the true story of US Chess Grand Master(GM) Bobby Fischer particularly his experiences leading to his match with Russian GM Boris Spassky during the 1972 World Chess Championships. It stars Tobey Maguire as Bobby Fischer and Liev Schreiber as Boris Spassky together with Lily Rabe and Peter Sarsgaard. The story starts when Bobby Fischer was a young child at age 6 who feels that he is being watched by Russian spies.Then,we get to see him develop into becoming a great player of chess after he immerses himself into the sport.This leads him to becoming the youngest Grandmaster in the world.Cold War is ongoing and Russians apparently have dominated the sport.This leads Fischer have more determination to become better in the sport and to win against the Russian grandmasters for the sake of his country.His efforts leads him to meet GM Boris Spassky in the 1972 World Chess Championship in the championship match and become fortunate enough to beat him. Well,it was nice to see this film. Tobey Maguire did well in his portrayal of Fischer.He definitely remains one of the better actors we have in Hollywood today.Too bad that it does not really dig deep into the subject particularly Fischer's life and the Russian dominance in chess.A better research on the topic could have made it a better film.In the end,it just became a watchable movie that a viewer will surely enjoy.",9,1,1,27 October 2016
Wimbledon," Bettany And Dunst Saves Wimbledon From Being A Disaster
","Wimbledon is a romantic comedy that centers on a the romance between a washed-up tennis professional,Peter Colt and an up-and-coming tennis star,Lizzie Bradbury that occurred during the Wimbledon Championships.It features Paul Bettany and Kirsten Dunst.The story of the film follows plight of Peter Colt,who is on wildcard participant at Wimbledon considering.At age 31,he intends to retire after the tournament and has decided to play a decent tennis match in it.Then he accidentally meets the up-and-coming Lizzie Bradbury after a mistake in the room given to him by a receptionist on the hotel he is staying.After they get to know each other after a series of events,they find each other attractive and fell for each other.This led to Peter improving his self-confidence and getting inspired playing at Wimbledon as he managed to win many matches and was able to finish at the tournament beyond many to fans' expectations.I found the film overall bland and boring. Added to that,both Bettany and Dunst aren't really believable as a couple despite the fact that both had good performances.What's even worse is the fact that the tennis action is far from authentic especially when one is familiar with the sport.Everyone watching this pretty much knew what is going to happen at the end of the film and how Peter is going to perform in his last tournament which made it contrived and predictable.Overall,the presence of the lead stars and their acting skills save this film especially when it lacks strong features and make it functional for people who love films of these genre.",7,1,1,15 July 2014
Lincoln," Spielberg's Best Since Schindler's List
","Lincoln is a historical drama film that features Daniel Day-Lewis as United States President Abraham Lincoln and Sally Field as Mary Todd Lincoln.The cast includes David Strathairn,Joseph Gordon-Levitt,James Spader,Hal Holbrook and Tommy Lee Jones.It is based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's biography Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln.The film covers the final four months of Lincoln's life, focusing on the President's efforts in January 1865 to have the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution passed by the United States House of Representatives.It was directed by Steven Spielberg.In a nation divided by war and the strong winds of change, President Abraham Lincoln pursues a course of action designed to end the war, unite the country and abolish slavery. Expecting the Civil War to end within a month but concerned that his 1863 Emancipation Proclamation may be discarded by the courts once the war has concluded and the 13th Amendment defeated by the returning slave states, Lincoln feels it is imperative to pass the amendment by the end of January, thus removing any possibility that slaves who have already been freed may be re- enslaved. The Radical Republicans fear the amendment will merely be defeated by some who wish to delay its passage; the support of the amendment by Republicans in the border states is not yet assured either, since they prioritize the issue of ending the war. Even if all of them are ultimately brought on board, the amendment will still require the support of several Democratic congressmen if it is to pass. With dozens of Democrats having just become lame ducks after losing their re- election campaigns in the fall of 1864, some of Lincoln's advisers believe that he should wait until the new Republican-heavy Congress is seated, presumably giving the amendment an easier road to passage. Lincoln, however, remains adamant about having the amendment in place and the issue of slavery settled before the war is concluded and the southern states readmitted into the Union.Lincoln's hopes for passage of the amendment rely upon the support of the Republican Party founder Francis Preston Blair, the only one whose influence can ensure that all members of the western and border state conservative Republican faction will back the amendment. With Union victory in the Civil War seeming highly likely and greatly anticipated, but not yet a fully accomplished fact, Blair is keen to end the hostilities as soon as possible. Therefore, in return for his support, Blair insists that Lincoln allow him to immediately engage the Confederate government in peace negotiations.With the moral courage and fierce determination to succeed, his choices during this critical moment will change the fate of generations to come.Lincoln paints a powerful and compelling portrait of the man who has become an icon. We don't need to see more of his life to understand how rare a figure he was as this film is more than sufficient as it masterfully captures the dual dilemmas facing the president in the final months of his life: how to bring the war between the states to an end, and how to eradicate slavery, once and for all.Daniel Day-Lewis portraying President Lincoln characteristically delivers in this witty, dignified portrait that immerses the audience in its world and entertains even as it informs.No wonder that this is easily Spielberg's best picture since Schindler's List.",10,1,3,6 April 2013
Children of Men," A Great Cautionary Futuristic Tale
","Children of Men is a science fiction feature that was loosely adapted from P. D. James's 1992 novel of the same title.It stars Clive Owen,Julianne Moore,Michael Caine,Claire-Hope Ashitey,Chiwetel Ejiofor,Pam Ferris and Danny Huston.The story is about a cautionary futuristic tale in which society is without hope since humankind lost its ability to procreate.The movie was directed by Alfonso Cuarón.The story was set in 2027.Women can no longer give birth. The youngest inhabitant of the planet has just died at the age of 18, and all hope for humanity has been lost. As civilization descends into chaos, a dying world finds one last chance for survival in the form of a woman who has become inexplicably pregnant. Now, as warring nationalistic sects clash and British leaders try to maintain their totalitarian stronghold on the country, a disillusioned bureaucrat is brought back into the fold of activism by his guerrilla ex-wife. Reluctantly, he takes on the daunting task of escorting Kee, the refugee who represents humankind's last hope for survival, out of harm's way and into the care of a mysterious organization known as The Human Project.The film is a great modern science fiction as it tells a cautionary tale of what could happen in the future.Although it may seem laughable or impossible now,who knows what could be at stake in the future? Nobody knows.The screenplay was an all-encompassing embrace of humanity, community and perseverance.Also,it provides an optimistic ending that doesn't feel at all like a clichéd or a predictable ending.Also,the performances of the cast are commendable in this film that has an end of the world theme.",10,2,9,30 October 2011
Million Dollar Baby," A Sportsdrama Masterpiece From Clint Eastwood
","Million Dollar Baby is a sports drama film directed, co-produced, and scored by Clint Eastwood.It features Eastwood together with Hilary Swank, and Morgan Freeman. It is the story of an under-appreciated boxing trainer, his elusive past, and his quest for atonement by helping an underdog amateur female boxer achieve her dream of becoming a professional.The screenplay was written by Paul Haggis, based on short stories by F.X. Toole.Frankie Dunnis a veteran boxing trainer who has devoted his life to the ring and has precious little to show for it; his daughter never answers his letters, and a fighter he's groomed into contender status has paid him back by signing with another manager, leaving Frankie high and dry. His best friend and faithful employee Eddie Dupris is a former fighter who Frankie trained. In his last fight, Eddie suffered a severe injury, a fact that brings Frankie great guilt. One day, Maggie Fitzgerald enters Frankie's life, as well as his gym, and announces she needs a trainer. Frankie regards her as a dubious prospect, and isn't afraid to tell her why: he doesn't think much of women boxing, she's too old at 31, she lacks experience, and has no technique. However, Maggie sees boxing as the one part of her life that gives her meaning and won't give up easily. Finally won over by her determination, Frankie takes on Maggie, and as she slowly grows into a viable fighter, an emotional bond develops between them. When a tragedy befalls one of the three characters, each comes to a decision that shows how the relationships in the film have changed them. The film has won four Academy Awards that includes Best Picture,Best Actress for Hillary Swank,Best Supporting Actor for Morgan Freeman and Best Director for Clint Eastwood.Obviously,Million Dollar Baby is a masterpiece.It was one of the best movies that Eastwood has made since Unforgiven.The story of a tragedy about an innately paternal man's desperate need to overcome his own emotional traps and the loyal girl who facilitates his growth by her steely will and stubborn drive will definitely catch the viewers emotion just like the character development of the three main characters involved.No question that the direction and acting particularly from Swank and Freeman were excellent,brilliant and outstanding.But overall,it is one motion picture that should never be missed nor put aside when selecting movies to be seen on a weekend.",10,4,5,30 November 2011
Donnie Brasco," A First-Class Mafia Thriller
","Donnie Brasco is a crime drama starring Al Pacino and Johnny Depp together Michael Madsen, Bruno Kirby, James Russo, and Anne Heche.It is based on the true story of Joseph D. Pistone, an FBI undercover agent who infiltrated the Bonanno crime family in New York City during the 1970s, under the alias Donnie Brasco, aka, 'The Jewel Man'.It was directed by Mike Newell.Joe Pistone is an FBI agent who is given an assignment to infiltrate the Mafia; calling himself Donnie Brasco, he befriends Lefty Ruggiero , a low-level mob hit man whose personal life is in tatters. Lefty's marriage is falling apart, his son is a junkie, and his health is failing, which only adds to his growing disillusionment about having spent 30 years with the Mafia with little to show for it. But in Donnie, Lefty sees someone who can succeed where he failed; he takes the young man under his wing, and under Lefty's tutelage Donnie quickly rises through the ranks of organized crime.However,as Donnie moves deeper into the Mafia, he realizes that not only is he crossing the line between federal agent and criminal, but also leading his friend Lefty to an almost certain death.It also drives a wedge between himself and his wife and children, and he realizes that a break in character among the hoodlums he's come to know could mean a death sentence for himself and his family. Just as importantly, Joe has come to regard Lefty as a close and trusted friend, and Joe realizes that when the day comes where he has to turn in his Mob associates, he'll be ending Lefty's life as surely as if he put a slug in his head himself.This is a first-class Mafia thriller.No question about it.First of all,the performances were nothing but spectacular.Pacino and Depp are a match made in acting heaven, riffing off each other with astonishing subtlety and wit.Also, is like a de-romanticized, de-mythologized version of The Godfather as it offers an uncommonly detailed, privileged glimpse inside the world of organized crime from the perspective of the little guys at the bottom of Mafia hierarchy rather than from the kingpins at the top. This not only one of the great modern-day gangster movies to put in the company of The Godfather films and GoodFellas, but it is also one of the great undercover police movies probably even surpassing Serpico and Prince of the City with respect to richness of character, detail, and moral complexity.In summary,it is a gangster movie that succeeds on all levels.Highly recommended indeed.",10,2,6,25 September 2012
The Nightmare Before Christmas," A Tim Burton Film
","For those who never thought Disney would release a film in which Santa Claus is kidnapped and tortured, well, here it is. The title is Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas, which should give you an idea of the tone of this stop-action animated musical/fantasy/horror/comedy. It is based on characters created by Burton himself.It tells the story of Jack Skellington, a being from 'Halloween Town' who opens a portal to 'Christmas Town' and decides to celebrate the holiday. Danny Elfman wrote the film score and provided the singing voice of Jack, as well as other minor characters. The remaining principal voice cast includes Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara, William Hickey, Ken Page and Glenn Shadix.Jack's obsession with Christmas leads him to usurp the role of Santa Claus. Every resident is assigned a task, while Sally, a rag doll woman who is created by the town's mad scientist, begins to feel a romantic attraction towards Jack. However, she alone fears that his plans will become disastrous. Jack assigns Lock, Shock and Barrel, a trio of mischievous children, to abduct Santa and bring him back to Halloween Town. Against Jack's wishes and largely for their amusement, the trio deliver Santa to Oogie Boogie, a gambling-addict bogeyman who plots to play a game with Santa's life at stake.Christmas Eve arrives and Sally attempts to stop Jack with fog, but he embarks into the sky on a coffin-like sleigh pulled by skeletal reindeer, guided by the glowing nose of his ghost dog Zero. He begins to deliver presents to children around the world, but the gifts only terrify the recipients. Jack is believed to be an impostor attempting to imitate Santa, and the military goes on alert to blast him out of the sky. The sleigh is shot down and he is presumed dead by Halloween Town's citizens, but in fact he has survived the crash, landing in a cemetery. Although he is depressed by the failure of his plan, he quickly regains his old spirit, having come up with new ideas for next Halloween. He then rushes back home to rescue Santa and put things right.Meanwhile, Sally attempts to free Santa, but is captured by Oogie. Jack slips into the lair and frees them, then confronts Oogie and unravels his outer covering to spill out all the bugs that live inside him. With Oogie gone, Santa reprimands Jack before setting off to deliver the right presents to the world's children. He makes snow fall over Halloween Town to show that there are no hard feelings between himself and Jack; the townspeople are confused by the snow at first, but soon begin to play happily in it. Jack reveals that he is attracted to Sally just as she is to him, and they kiss under the full moon in the cemetery.A stunningly original and visually delightful work of stop-motion animation.This cautionary fable may be a little too twisted for little kids but anyone 8 or older will spot the friendly glint behind jack's empty eye sockets.But nevertheless,it is a work of grand visual wit, clever songs, funny gags and genuine pathos, it is perhaps the greatest stop-motion animated film ever, a painstaking style of model animation that computers have all but completely done away with.The dazzling techniques employed here create a striking look that's never been seen in such sustained form, making this a unique curio that will appeal to kids and film enthusiasts alike.Finally,Tim Burton magic with just a touch of scariness that it makes it a must-see.",10,1,1,23 October 2012
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," A Showdown Between Murrow & McCarthy
","Good Night, and Good Luck. is a drama that portrays the conflict between veteran radio and television journalist Edward R. Murrow and U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, especially relating to the anti- Communist Senator's actions with the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.It stars David Strathairn and George Clooney together with Robert Downey, Jr.,Patricia Clarkson,Frank Langella,Jeff Daniels, Tate Donovan and Alex Borstein.The movie, although released in black and white, was filmed on color film stock but on a gray-scale set, and was color corrected to black and white during post-production. It focuses on the theme of media responsibility, and also addresses what occurs when the media offers a voice of dissent against the government.It was also directed by its lead star,George Clooney and the screenplay was written also by Clooney and Grant Heslov.In 1953, Edward R. Murrow was one of the best-known newsmen on television as host of both the talk show Person to Person and the pioneering investigate series See It Now. Joseph McCarthy, a U.S. senator from Wisconsin, was generating no small amount of controversy in the public and private sectors with his allegations that Communists had risen to positions of power and influence in America, and an Air Force pilot, Milo Radulovich, had been drummed out of the service due to McCarthy's charges that he was a Communist agent. However, Radulovich had been dismissed without a formal hearing of the charges, and he protested that he was innocent of any wrongdoing. Murrow decided to do a story on Radulovich's case questioning the legitimacy of his dismissal, which was seen by McCarthy and his supporters as an open challenge to his campaign. McCarthy responded by accusing Murrow of being a Communist, leading to a legendary installment of See It Now in which both Murrow and McCarthy presented their sides of the story, which was seen by many as the first step toward McCarthy's downfall. Meanwhile, Murrow had to deal with CBS head William Paley, who was supportive of Murrow but extremely wary of his controversial positions, while Murrow was also trying to support fellow newsman Don Hollenbeck, battling charges against his own political views, and working alongside Fred Friendly, the daring head of CBS News.This is a film that will live on for years, because it bears a message about dissension, and the power of the press.Also,it still proves that it is still possible in the cinema, if not in television, to inform without being boring and entertain without condescending for it is an excellent film that uses the past to make today's media and their audiences address their responsibilities.Aside from that,it is a passionate and concise civics lesson from the past, arriving with much political and cultural relevance to today.Finally,the film imparts a cautionary tale: Don't let anyone else do your thinking for you.",10,1,1,28 September 2012

Dumb and Dumber," A Movie That Lives Up To Its Name
","Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels play the title roles in this genially low- brow comedy which can also be classified as a celebration of stupidity in this film entitled,Dumb And Dumber.The story is about the not-so- dynamic duo of Lloyd and Harry, dunderheads who come into the possession of a briefcase containing ransom money that is intended for Mob- connected kidnappers. Lauren Holly costars as the woman who lost the briefcase, and with whom Carrey falls in love with.It was written and directed by the Farrelly brothers.Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne are two intellectually-challenged best friends who share an apartment so messy that gangsters aren't sure how to trash the place.The guys also have a certain problem holding on to jobs. Lloyd is working as a limo driver in Rhode Island when he picks up a beautiful and wealthy woman named Mary Swanson,who is being taken to the airport. Lloyd immediately falls head over heels in love with Mary, and when she leaves a briefcase at the airport, he's determined to return it in hopes of impressing her. Lloyd isn't able to get aboard Mary's flight. Harry has a van decorated to look like a dog, and the pair hop in the Poochmobile to find Mary in Aspen. What Lloyd and Harry don't know is that the briefcase is full of money, which Mary deliberately left at the airport as a ransom payment to save the life of her kidnapped husband. This is a relentlessly stupid comedy elevated by its main actors. Jim Carrey goes bonkers and Jeff Daniels carries himself admirably in an against-type performance.The wholeheartedness of this descent into crude and rude humor is so good-natured and precise that it's hard not to partake in the guilty pleasures of the exercise.Finally,it is definitely a movie that fully lives up to its name, right down to an opening credit sequence rife with intentional misspellings and grammatical errors.",10,1,2,2 October 2012
Grave of the Fireflies," A Great Japanese Anime Masterpiece
","It is a Japanese animated anti-war tragedy film written and directed by Isao Takahata. This is the first film produced by Shinchosha, who hired Studio Ghibli to do the animation production work. It is a film adaptation of the semi-autobiographical novel of the same name by Akiyuki Nosaka, intended as a personal apology to the author's own sister who died from malnutrition during the Second World War that features Tsutomu Tatsumi, Ayano Shiraishi, Yoshiko Shinohara and Akemi Yamaguchi.The film opens on an evening in 1945, after Japan's surrender at the end of World War II; and in a train station, the young Seita dies alone. The rest of the movie tells us, in flashback, how things have come to this. Seita and Setsuko are two young Japanese children growing up in the waning days of World War II. Much to Seita's pride, their father is in the Japanese navy, and they live fairly content lives in Kobe despite rationing and the other privations of war. When their mother dies from burns suffered during an American fire-bombing raid, a distant aunt takes them in and conflict eventually forces the children to try to survive on their own. At first,Seita and his little sister enjoy their idyllic lives in the country, but harsh reality eventually settles in as Seita begins to understand the difficulties of taking care of a young child when both food and compassion are scarce. Isao Takahata's powerful antiwar film has been praised by critics wherever it has been screened around the world. The writer-director who happens to be a frequent collaborator of Miyazaki's at Studio Ghibli, adapted a partly autobiographical novel by Akiyuki Nosaka, and his handling of the tragic story is masterfully understated.Added to that,it is an achingly sad anti-war film that is one of Studio Ghibli's most profoundly beautiful, haunting works that it gives the viewer an emotional experience so powerful that it forces a rethinking of animation.Overall,it is a wonderful example of the beauty of anime film making.",10,1,2,24 October 2012

Miraculously, The Bride survives a bullet to the head and, four years later, she sets out for revenge against her four assassins and their employer.Kill Bill Volume 1 is a great film due to its stylish direction as it pays homages to film genres such as Hong Kong martial arts films, Japanese chanbara films, Italian spaghetti westerns, girls with guns, and rape and revenge.Although the movie is somewhat strange,it gets better particularly the action scenes as it moves along.It is a very violent movie but it was done excellently by Tarantino.Overall,Kill Bill Volume 1 provides us an action movie with striking beauty and violence like no other.",10,2,6,10 November 2011
Ip Man," A Bona Fide Martial Arts Classic
","Ip Man is a Hong Kong semi-biographical martial arts film very loosely based on the life of Yip Man, a grand master of the martial art Wing Chun and master of Bruce Lee. It focuses on events in Ip's life that supposedly took place in the city of Foshan during the Sino-Japanese War. It stars Donnie Yen in the title role together with Simon Yam, Lynn Hung, Lam Ka-tung, Xing Yu and Hiroyuki Ikeuchi to play key supporting roles.was directed by Wilson Yip.Behind every great man there lies a teacher, and this was certainly true of Bruce Lee, who claimed as his mentor a martial arts expert named Ip Man. A genius of Wushu, Ip Man grew up in a China nearly ripped to pieces by racial hatred, nationalistic strife, and warfare. He rose like a phoenix above these ashes, however, courtesy of his participation in matches against various Wushu masters and kung fu warriors and ultimately training martial arts icons such as Lee.Wilson Yip has crafted a gripping, rousing, beautifully structured yarn, built around a calm but charismatic star performance by Donnie Yen and magnificent action sequences choreographed by the legendary Sammo Hung.At once beholden to the established conventions of the genre and delightfully subversive of them, it is one of the most exciting and refreshingly character-driven martial arts films in years.It is not only is it one of the most entertaining and exciting movies out of Hong Kong for many years but it is a bona fide martial arts classic.",10,3,4,19 October 2012
The Last Emperor," A Biopic About Puyi
","The Last Emperor is a biopic about the life of Puyi, the last Emperor of China, whose autobiography was the basis for the screenplay written by Mark Peploe and Bernardo Bertolucci,the film's director.The film stars John Lone as Pu Yi, with Joan Chen, Peter O'Toole, Ruocheng Ying, Victor Wong, Dennis Dun, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Maggie Han, Ric Young, Vivian Wu, and Chen Kaige.Puyi's life is depicted from his ascent to the throne as a small boy to his imprisonment and political rehabilitation by the Chinese Communist authorities.Told in flashback, the film covers the years 1908 to 1967. We first see the three-year-old Pu Yi being installed in the Forbidden City by ruthless, dying dowager Empress Tzu-Hsui. Though he'd prefer to lark about like other boys, the infant emperor is cossetted and cajoled into accepting the responsibilities and privileges of his office. In 1912, the young emperor forced to abdicate when China is declared a republic, is a prisoner in his own palace, 'protected' from the outside world. Fascinated by the worldliness of his Scottish tutor, Pu Yi plots an escape from his cocoon by means of marriage. He selects Manchu descendant Wan Jung, who likewise is anxious to experience the 20th century rather than be locked into the past by tradition. Played as an adult by John Lone, Pu Yi puts into effect several social reforms, and also clears the palace of the corrupt eunuchs who've been shielding him from life. In 1924, an invading warlord expels the denizens of the Forbidden City, allowing Pu Yi to 'westernize' himself by embracing popular music and the latest dances as a guest of the Japanese Concession in Tientsin. Six years later, his power all but gone, Pu Yi escapes to Manchuria, where he unwittingly becomes a political pawn for the now-militant Japanese government. Humiliating his faithful wife, Pu Yi falls into bad romantic company, carrying on affairs with a variety of parasitic females. During World War II, the Japanese force Pu Yi to sign a series of documents which endorse their despotic military activities. At war's end, the emperor is taken prisoner by the Russians; while incarcerated, he is forced to fend for himself without servants at his beck and call for the first time. He is finally released in 1959 and displayed publicly as proof of the efficacy of Communist re-education. We last see him in 1967, the year of his death; now employed by the State as a gardener, Pu Yi makes one last visit to the Forbidden City as a tourist. Bernardo Bertolucci's cinematic biography of Emperor Pu Yi is an astonishing, ravishing and smashing film.It allows the viewer with greater reason to feel compassion for the emperor, with his often wordless sense-adventure in the mysteries that could only be known to one little boy plunged into indecipherable alien decorum, robbed of self-determination and common sense by his infinite privilege. This is definitely one of cinema's greatest cinematographic performances combines with a director's epic vision and superb craftsmanship to create a visual masterpiece.",10,1,1,24 October 2012

Jurassic World," Danger At The Theme Park
","Steven Spielberg,the director of Jurassic Park and The Lost World:The Jurassic Park, returns as the new executive producer of the Jurassic Park film series in this new film known as Jurassic World.This is the fourth installment of the series that presents a cast that includes Chris Pratt,Bryce Dallas Howard,Vincent D'Onofrio,Ty Simpkins,Nick Robinson,Omar Sy and B. D. Wong with Colin Trevorrow taking over the movie's director.Twenty-two years after the events of the Jurassic Park,a theme park that has cloned dinosaurs was made at a fictional island called Isla Nublar,which is located off the Pacific coast of Central America.The park has successfully operated for the last ten years.But things go wrong when a genetically created dinosaur known as Indominus rex escapes and breaks lose causing extreme danger into the park.All breaks lose as the people try to manage to survive the event.The fourth Jurassic Park film was definitely nostalgic in the sense that it tries to provide more scares and violence coming from the newly cloned dinosaurs.It was a good idea to have an operational theme park as a setting since this was probably the main purpose of having this cloned dinosaur in the first three films.At least,they finally found a way to have an operational theme park and have achieved that objective.Since the sequels The Lost World:The Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III,the viewers are once again treated to a darker film that focuses on the danger presented by the cloned dinosaurs as compared to the characters involved despite having Claire's transformation from a corporate woman who hates dinosaurs into becoming a warrior-like woman who is more appreciative of animals in the end.Terror film lovers will surely appreciate this film for it will definitely brought the entertainment they require from a movie.No wonder it earned more than a billion dollars when it was released world- wide.",9,1,2,6 November 2016
Mission: Impossible II," A Secret Agent's Impossible Mission To Australia
","Tom Cruise reprises his role as Ethan Hunt,a secret agent of the IMF,whose new impossible mission sends him this time to Australia. This is the second installment of the new Mission Impossible series.This time it is directed by John Woo and it also stars Dougray Scott,Thandie Newton,Rade Serbedzija and an uncredited Anthony Hopkins.In this new Mission Impossible movie,Ethan Hunt has been sent on a mission to retrieve and destroy the supply of Chimera,a genetically disease that was created to inflict disease to people around the world. One obstacle to his mission is that international terrorists headed by a former agent,Ambrose,portrayed excellently by Dougray Scott. He has successfully stolen Bellerophon,the cure for the said disease and now needs Chimera to complete their evil plan of killing millions of people around the world.In this mission, IMF assigns Hunt to include Nyah Nordoff-Hall,played by Thandie Newton, a professional thief, for she is the only possible means to get close to Ambrose due to the fact that both are former lovers.A love triangle also ensues as both Hunt and Nyah gets close to one another.The movie is clichéd but it is entertaining in the sense that the action scenes were directed average enough for a typical action film by John Woo.Lots of thrills,fun and excitement were definitely there for action fans as well as Tom Cruise fans.Not too many thinking is needed in the story.A viewer who loves films of this kind will never be disappointed. Everyone knows that the eventually,Ethan Hunt is going to be successful in his mission and he ends up with Nyah when the end credits rolls.Overall,the the second film just like the first film is not at the level of the original classic TV series nor the revival classic TV series shown in the 80's.",2,1,2,8 October 2011
The Adjustment Bureau," Excellent Character Work From The Lead Stars
","The Adjustment Bureau is a romantic action thriller film loosely based on the Philip K. Dick short story,Adjustment Team.It stars Matt Damon and Emily Blunt with a cast that includes Anthony Mackie, John Slattery, Michael Kelly, and Terence Stamp.It was written and directed by George Nolfi.In 2006, Brooklyn Congressman David Norris unsuccessfully runs for the United States Senate. While rehearsing his concession speech, David meets Elise Sellas. Inspired by her, David delivers an unusually candid speech that is well-received, making him a favorite for the 2010 Senate race.On the brink of winning a seat in the U.S. Senate, ambitious politician David Norris meets beautiful contemporary ballet dancer Elise Sellas. She is a woman like none he's ever known. But just as he realizes he's falling for her, mysterious men conspire to keep the two apart. David learns he is up against the agents of Fate itself also known as the men of The Adjustment Bureau,who will do everything in their considerable power to prevent David and Elise from being together. In the face of overwhelming odds, he must either let her go and accept a predetermined path or risk everything to defy the Adjustment Bureau to be with her.It's rare when a film is able to blend together two different genres so well, especially when they are two genres that you don't normally see together, in this case, science-fiction and romance.The on-screen pairing of Matt Damon and Emily Blunt is so believable and entertaining due to their great on-screen chemistry.Unfortunately,first-time writer/director George Nolfi struggles to maintain a consistent tone that one may find a bit muddled through the middle third and a finishes with a Hollywood-like ending as the story sadly descend into science- fiction nonsense after a bold start.Only the excellent character work from leads will keep you watching.",9,1,1,5 April 2013
World Trade Center," A Reminder Of Humanity During 9/11/2001
","Nicolas Cage stars in the unforgettable true story of the courageous rescue and survival of two Port Authority policemen who were trapped in the rubble on September 11, 2001 after they volunteered to go in and help in this drama,World Trade Center.It also features Maria Bello, Michael Peña, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Michael Shannon.Director Oliver Stone once again is at helm in a film that offers a powerful and provocative story based on the real events that involves John McLoughlin and William J. Jimeno, both of whom cooperated with producers. Sergeant John McLoughlin and William J. Jimeno were two officers assigned to New York City's Port Authority who were working their beats on a quiet day in early fall when they received an emergency call. The day was September 11, 2001, and they were among the policemen who attempted to evacuate the World Trade Center towers after they were struck by airliners piloted by terrorists. Both were inside the fifth building of the World Trade Center when the towers fell, and were two of the last people found alive amidst the wreckage. As they struggled to hold on to their lives as rescuers sifted through the rubble, their spouses -- Donna McLoughlin and Allison Jimeno clung to the desperate hope that their husbands would survive and be found. As the both their families waited for word on the fate of the two men, they watched as a city and a nation came together with strength and compassion in the face of a tragedy.As a visually stunning tribute to lives lost in tragedy, World Trade Center succeeds unequivocally, and it is more politically muted than many of Stone's other works as the director concentrated on one of the catastrophe's stories and has fashioned it well with almost palpable physical detail, and with performances that never sink to exploitation. Granted, it's only the film's historical context that distinguishes it from any other dramatic rescue story, but in focusing on the goodness of humanity in response to the evil of terrorists who remain unnamed and off-screen, the film creates an emotional context as powerful as anything Stone has done since Platoon. Even as he resorts to some questionable tactics typically lacking in subtlety, Stone refrains from much of the blunt-force film-making that has made him a critical punching bag, rising to this challenging occasion with a heartfelt and deeply American portrait of unity whether personal, familial, and national. Flaws and all, World Trade Center serves an honorable purpose, reminding us all that for those fleeting days in September 2001, America showed its best face to a sympathetic world.",9,3,6,8 October 2012

Despite the fact that it has a talented cast,it does not deliver enough laughter and humor to hold a candle to the first Hangover film.",8,1,1,27 December 2014
Rudy," Truly An Inspiring Film
","A young man learns to let nothing stop him from realizing his ambitions in this sports drama entitled,Rudy.This is a film that gives an account of the life of Daniel 'Rudy' Ruettiger, who harbored dreams of playing football at the University of Notre Dame despite significant obstacles. It stars Sean Astin on the title role as Rudy together with Jon Favreau, Ned Beatty,Charles S. Dutton,Greta Lind,Scott Benjaminson and Lili Taylor.The screenplay was written by Angelo Pizzo and it was directed by David Anspaugh.Rudy Ruettiger grows up in Joliet, Illinois; dreaming of playing college football at the University of Notre Dame. While achieving some success with his local high school team, he lacks the grades and money to attend Notre Dame, not to mention talent and physical size. Ruettiger was much smaller than an average football player, standing just 5'6' and weighing 165 lb.Ruettiger takes a job at a local steel mill like his father Daniel, Sr.; he prepares to settle down. But when his best friend Pete is killed in an explosion there, Rudy decides to follow his dream of attending Notre Dame and playing for the Fighting Irish.He leaves for the campus, but fails to get admitted to Notre Dame. With the help of a local priest, Rudy starts at a small junior college nearby named Holy Cross, hoping to qualify for a transfer. He also manages to get a part- time job on Notre Dame's grounds keeping staff and befriends D-Bob, a graduate student at Notre Dame and a teaching assistant at his junior college. The socially-awkward D-Bob offers to tutor Rudy if he helps him meet girls. Suspecting an underlying cause to Ruettiger's previous academic problems, D-Bob has Rudy tested, and Rudy learns that he has dyslexia. Rudy learns how to overcome his disability and becomes a better student. At Christmas vacation, Rudy returns home to his family's appreciation of his report card, but is still mocked for his attempts at playing football and also dumped by his girlfriend, who starts seeing one of his brothers.During his final semester of transfer eligibility, Rudy is admitted to Notre Dame. He rushes home to tell his family. At the steel mill, his father announces it over the loudspeaker, 'Hey, you guys, my son's going to Notre Dame!' After 'walking on' as a non- scholarship player for the football team, Ruettiger convinces coach Ara Parseghian to give him a spot on the practice (or 'scout') squad. An assistant coach warns the players that 35 scholarship players won't make the roster. But, Ruettiger exhibits more drive than some of his scholarship teammates.Parseghian agrees to the young man's request to suit up for one home game in his senior year so his family and friends can see him as a member of the team. However, Parseghian steps down as coach following the 1974 season. Dan Devine succeeds him in 1975 and decides against giving Ruettiger a chance to appear at a home game. Led by team captain and All-American Roland Steele, the other seniors rise to his defense and lay their jerseys on Devine's desk, each requesting that Rudy be allowed to dress in their place. Devine relents and lets Ruettiger suit up for the final home game, against Georgia Tech. At the final home game, Steele invites Ruettiger to lead the team out of the tunnel onto the playing field. As the game comes to an end, and Notre Dame is ahead, Devine sends all the seniors to the field, but refuses to let Rudy play, despite the pleas from Steele and the assistant coaches. Then, the Notre Dame bench starts a 'Rudy!' chant that soon goes stadium wide, and the offensive team, led by tailback Jamie O'Hare, overrules Devine's call for victory formation and they score another touchdown instead. Devine finally lets Rudy enter the field with the defensive team on the final kickoff. He stays in for the final play of the game and sacks the opposing quarterback, and is carried off on the shoulders of his teammates.The film,Rudy is undeniably sentimental.Sean Astin's performance as Rudy is so self-effacing,focused and low-key that we lose sight of the underdog formula and begin to focus on this dogged kid who won't quit. Although it was predictable,the last big scene is an emotional powerhouse that would probably provide a tear in the viewer's eyes.It was truly an inspiring sports film about a real life underdog and a person with a endless determination that transcends sports for it is relevant to many who want to find inspiration in life.",10,1,2,24 December 2011
Silence," Scorsese's Exploration Of Faith And Spirituality Fell Short
","Martin Scorsese does another film in the tradition of his former films like 'The Last Temptation Of Christ' which explores religious themes such as faith in the face of oppression,spirituality and the conflict of divine nature and human nature in this film entitled 'Silence'.It was based on the 1966 novel written by Shūsaku Endō of the same title as well as the 1971 Japanese film adaptation of the said novel entitled 'Chinmoku' (English translation:Silence).It stars Andrew Garfield,Adam Driver,Tadanobu Asano,Ciarán Hinds and Liam Neeson. Director Martin Scorsese and Jay Cocks wrote the screenplay together.The story starts when Portuguese Jesuit priest Fr.Alessandro Valignano receives the news that Father Cristóvão Ferreira,who went to Japan has already renounced his Roman Catholic faith.Despite knowing the on- going Christian oppression and the danger they are facing,Fathers Francisco Garupe and Sebastião Rodrigues decided to embark a journey in the country with the help of an alcoholic fisherman Kichijiro. All of them land in a village that consist of many Japanese Christians.As the story progresses, we get to see both Rodrigues and Garupe witness the on-going violence that has been happening in the country due to Christian oppression.In the end,we get to see themselves also get arrested by the Japanese soldiers with aid of Kichijiro. We also get to see the meeting between Father Rodrigues and Ferreira,who apparently has already apostatized being a Catholic and has become already a Buddhist and have immersed into becoming a Buddhist and into the Japanese culture as well.We get to see their exchange of words with Ferreira trying to convince Rodrigues to renounce his faith for the sake of living a longer life as well and to end the suffering,torture and oppression that he is undergoing as well as those that he is witnessing which included the death of many Christian Japanese villagers as well as that of Garupe,who was stabbed in the middle of the ocean.When Rodrigues could no longer bear his suffering emotionally, psychologically and physically,he decided to apostatize in the end and renounce his Catholic faith just like Ferreira as well. But when he passed away and he given a Buddhist burial, interestingly Rodrigues held a small cross in his hand.After watching this film two days before this review was being written,it led me to the original 1971 Japanese film 'Chimoku'.Personally,I felt that this was basically more of a remake of 'Chimoku' rather than having an American version of the Endō's novel. The interesting exchange of words between Ferreira and Rodrigues from apostasy, God's divine nature particularly being silent especially when man needs His response the most after prayer, and the renunciation of faith could only be a formality to live longer were all explored.Too bad that I just felt the lack of intensity in it and the exploration of these themes was somewhat lacking. Don't get me wrong. Andrew Garfield and Liam Neeson as Rodrigues and Ferreira respectively could have given a better performance for they are both talented actors. I just felt the screenplay fell short.I blame both screenwriters -Jay Cocks and director Martin Scorsese - for it. Rodrigues just gave up his faith and I felt that he never experienced so much pain physically,psychologically and emotionally from it when he lived as a Japanese pagan and got immersed into their country's culture. Also,the suffering that he had to go through felt lacking as well as the desire want to live longer.I felt that wanting less Christian Japanese villagers killed wasn't enough considering he was a priest - who loves Christ the most.Besides,aren't the Christian Japanese villagers willing to die for Christ? They didn't even stepped on and spat on the Christian carvings and were undergoing a lot of sufferings for very a long time and yet never abandoned their faith. What's even worse is that the issue of martyrdom among the Japanese villagers wasn't fully explored as well. The film showed that these Christian converts died due to lack of education.Nothing more.Even the complexity of the character of Kichijiro was left at that reason as well together with the on-going Christian persecution that was occurring in Japan during the 17th century. That is why it somehow felt short due to lack of full exploration of the themes about faith and spirituality.It also never took into consideration their pride as a Japanese people and why their love for Jesus is greater unlike the Japanese soldiers,whose love for country resisted Western influence that all pointed to Christianity was definitely mentioned.If you want to see a better film,check out the Japanese film 'Chinmoku' for is a lot better than Scorsese's version.",6,11,21,15 January 2017
For Love of the Game," Worth The View For Love Of The Game
","For Love of the Game is a sports drama movie that was based on the novel of the same title by Michael Shaara.The film stars Kevin Costner and Kelly Preston.The story follows the a perfect game performance of an aging star baseball pitcher as he reminisces about his career and his relationship with his on-and-off girlfriend, while pitching his final game.The screenplay was written by Dana Stevens and it was directed by Sam Raimi.The story centers on Billy Chapel,who is the star pitcher with the Detroit Tigers, standing on the mound at Yankee Stadium in his last game and throwing what is shaping up to be a perfect game with the help of his best friend and catcher, Gus Osinski. However, Billy is having a hard time keeping his mind on the game; he's come to a crossroads in both his personal and professional lives, and he isn't sure what to do or where to go. He's learned that the Tigers are about to be sold, and the new owners intend to trade him at the end of the season, and that his girlfriend Jane is planning to leave him.But guess what,something else happens.After finishing the perfect game, Billy sits alone in his hotel room as the realization sinks in that everything he has been and done for the past 19 years is over. Despite his amazing accomplishment, he weeps not only for the loss of baseball, but for the other love of his life, Jane. The next morning, Billy goes to the airport to inquire about a flight for London. Jane has missed her flight so she could watch the end of his perfect game. Finding her there waiting for her plane, they embrace and reconcile.The movie is clichéd,contrived and predictable just like most sports movies and apparently most romantic comedies.As one well-known critic was quoted in his review of the film,'Thinking back through the movie, I cannot recall a single thing either character said that was worth hearing in its own right, apart from the requirements of the plot.' I totally agree with the said movie reviewer.But what made the movie work is Costner and Preston's convincing professionalism and chemistry together that kept the audience involved and engaged all through out the movie.In the end,it is still worth the view 'for love of the game'.",8,1,2,30 October 2011
Big Fish," A Great Film From Tim Burton
","Big Fish is a fantasy adventure film based on the novel of the same title by Daniel Wallace. The film was directed by Tim Burton and stars Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Billy Crudup, Jessica Lange, and Marion Cotillard. Other roles are performed by Helena Bonham Carter, Matthew McGrory, and Danny DeVito among others. Finney plays Edward Bloom, a former traveling salesman from the Southern United States with a gift for storytelling, now confined to his deathbed. Bloom's estranged son, a journalist played by Crudup, attempts to mend their relationship as his dying father relates tall tales of his eventful life as a young adult, played by Ewan McGregor.The film's theme of reconciliation between a dying father and his son had special significance for Burton, as his father had died in 2000 and his mother in 2002, a month before he signed on to direct.William Bloom is a young man who never really knew his dying father, Edward outside of the tall tales he told about growing up, making his way, and meeting his mother. During Edward's last days, William and his wife Josephine hold bedside vigil as the old man recollects elaborate memories of his youth. Still doubting the the legends and folklore, William makes a journey to meet a mysterious woman from whom Edward had bought property.After a string of mediocre movies, director Tim Burton regains his footing as he shifts from macabre fairy tales to Southern tall tales.This is a compelling look at the relationships between fathers and sons, and the child coming to terms with the parent's mortality.Reliant more on powerful familial emotions than wacky splendor, this film treads as close to our real world - a melancholy dissection of paternal distance and never truly knowing how many lives those we love can truly affect. The result is sweet but thanks to the director's dark and clever sensibility and never saccharine.",10,1,2,21 October 2012
The Insider," An Excellent Corporate Thriller
","The Insider is a corporate thriller based on the true story of a 60 Minutes television series segment, as seen through the eyes of a real tobacco executive, Jeffrey Wigand.The 60 Minutes story originally aired in November 1995 in an altered form because of objections by CBS' then- owner, Laurence Tisch, who also controlled Lorillard Tobacco.The story was later aired on February 4, 1996.It stars Al Pacino as Lowell Bergman,Russell Crowe as Jeffrey Wigand, Christopher Plummer as Mike Wallace,Bruce McGill as Attorney Ron Motley, Philip Baker Hall as Don Hewitt together with Diane Venora, Michael Gambon, Lindsay Crouse, Gina Gershon, Debi Mazar, and Colm Feore. It was adapted by Eric Roth and Michael Mann from the Vanity Fair magazine article 'The Man Who Knew Too Much' by Marie Brenner. The film was also directed by Mann.The Insider tells the true story of a man who decided to tell the world what the seven major tobacco companies knew and concealed about the dangers of their product - the cigarette. Jeffrey Wigand was a scientist employed in research for a tobacco firm, Brown and Williamson. Not long after he was fired by Brown and Williamson,Wigand came into contact with Lowell Bergman, a producer for 60 Minutes who worked closely with journalist Mike Wallace. Bergman arranged for Wigand to be interviewed by Wallace for a 60 Minutes expose on the cigarette industry, though Wigand was still bound by a confidentiality agreement not to discuss his employment with the company. Despite Wigand's willingness to talk, CBS pulled his interview from at the last minute after Brown and Williamson threatened a multi-billion dollar lawsuit. The staff of 60 Minutes and CBS News were soon embroiled in an internal struggle over the killing of the story,and Wigand found himself the subject of lawsuits and a smear campaign,without his full story reaching the public. This is one great film expose about the truth behind the cigarette,the dangers of smoking in terms of the chemicals behind in the production of the dangerous product and the reason behind why people continue to get addicted to smoking despite the fact of the health hazards behind it.It was more than just a fascinating whistle blower about the ingredients of tobacco.The film also consists of great performance from Pacino,Crowe and Plummer as well as Mann's brilliant direction,despite having no action scenes for which he is known for,that truly makes it a truly great film. Also,the screenplay also made the not-so-interesting story full of suspense and tension.Overall,The Insider is one hell of an excellent film.",10,5,6,30 October 2011

The Dark Knight," The Dark Knight: The Greatest Superhero Film Ever Made
","Christopher Nolan steps back into the director's chair for this sequel to Batman Begins, which finds the titular superhero coming face to face with his greatest nemesis -- Joker in this movie entitled,The Dark Knight. Christian Bale returns to the role of Batman, Maggie Gyllenhaal takes over the role of Rachel Dawes, and Brokeback Mountain star Heath Ledger dons the ghoulishly gleeful Joker makeup previously worn by Jack Nicholson and Cesar Romero. Just as it begins to appear as if Batman, Lt. James Gordon,played by Gary Oldman, and District Attorney Harvey Dent,portrayed by Aaron Eckhart, are making headway in their tireless battle against the criminal element, a maniacal, wisecracking fiend plunges the streets of Gotham City into complete chaos.Nolan's inspiration for the film was the Joker's comic book debut in 1940, and the 1996 series The Long Halloween, which retold Two-Face's origin. In addition elements of Steve Englehart and Marshall Rogers' Dark Detective miniseries as well as the unpublished follow-up were reportedly cannibalized along with other elements of Batman mythology for the story.In Gotham City, the Joker and accomplices rob a mob-owned bank, the Joker killing off the others and escaping alone. Batman and Lieutenant Jim Gordon decide to include the district attorney Harvey Dent in on their plan to bring down Gotham's mob, currently led by Sal Maroni. Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne meets Dent and Rachel Dawes, deciding to host a fund raiser to show his support for Dent. The Joker approaches the mob, offering them his services should they need it. Corrupt accountant Lau, working for the mob, flees to Hong Kong but is dragged back to Gotham by Batman, agreeing to testify against the mob.Maroni and the Chechen turn to the Joker who begins murdering people on a daily basis unless Batman unmasks himself.

In the closing scenes, Gordon destroys the Bat Signal, and Lucius watches the locator machine self-destruct, and Batman flees the police, Gordon considering Batman the city's real hero.Dark, complex and unforgettable, The Dark Knight succeeds not just as an entertaining comic book film, but as a richly thrilling crime saga.It becomes more than just a superhero film unlike the others released like Superman,Spiderman,Green Latern and many others as it was more than a comic-book adventure but a sprawling crime epic.Allusions to our current struggles with surveillance, public perception and terrorism are thrown into the mix, adding political immediacy to Nolan's psycho noir.The acting of the cast was simply superb and outstanding particularly the late Heath Ledger,whose last role the Joker would still go down in cinema history as one of the most creepily unhinged big-screen bad guys of all time.Finally,this also proves that Christopher Nolan is much, much smarter than your average filmmaker.It was simply one of the best films ever made and the best superhero film ever made.",10,4,9,9 January 2012

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," A Great Harry Potter Movie
","Young wizard-in-training Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts for his fifth year of studies, only to find that the magical community seems to be in a curious state of denial about his recent encounter with the sinister Lord Voldemort in the fifth installment of the popular fantasy film series based on the best-selling books by author J.K. Rowling.This movie is directed by David Yates and it is the fifth installment in the Harry Potter film series, written by Michael Goldenberg and produced by David Heyman and David Barron. The film stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, alongside Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Harry's best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger respectively.The story follows Harry Potter's fifth year at Hogwarts as the Ministry of Magic refuses to believe the return of the evil Lord Voldemort. Rumor has it that the dreaded Lord Voldemort has returned, but Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge isn't so sure what to make of all the hearsay currently floating around the campus of Hogwarts. Suspecting that Headmaster Albus Dumbledore may be fueling the rumors regarding Voldemort's return in order to undermine his authority and lay claim to his job, Fudge entrusts newly arrived Defense Against the Dark Arts professor Dolores Umbridge with the task of tracking Dumbledore and keeping a protective watch over the nervous student body. The young wizards of Hogwarts will need something much more effective than Umbridge's Ministry-approved course in defensive magic if they are to truly succeed in the extraordinary battle that lies ahead, however, and when the administration fails to provide the students with the tools that they will need to defend Hogwarts against the fearsome powers of the Dark Arts, Hermione, Ron, and Harry take it upon themselves to recruit a small group of students to form 'Dumbledore's Army' in preparation for the ultimate supernatural showdown.The fifth Harry Potter film has arrived. The time is long past that this can be considered a simple 'children's' series and children and adults alike will enjoy it immensely. Starting off from the dark and tragic ending of the fourth film, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix begins in a somber and angst-filled tone that carries through the entire 138 minutes. It's not easy to take the longest Harry Potter book and streamline it into the shortest Harry Potter franchise movie, but director David Yates does a bang up job of it, creating an Order of the Phoenix that's entertaining and action-packed.The director, especially given the sinister subject matter on hand, does a rather workmanlike job of traffic-managing the action. But some of the magic effects are indeed magical. Although, the loyal fans of J.K. Rowling's books will suffer huge cuts from the original plot and character developments, but make no mistake: this is a great movie.",10,1,2,22 October 2012
Into the Wild," Sean Penn's Powerful Movie About A Character Study of McCandless
","Jon Krakauer's novel,'Into The Wild' was a book assigned during my English courses when I was still in college.I found the book interesting since I have always been intrigued by the travel stories of Christopher McCandless.When it was turned into a movie,I expected a little less compared to the non-fiction novel I read.The talented actor,Sean Penn did not disappoint me in terms of his screenplay and his directorial effort for the book's adaptation into the big screen.It became an epic movie no less.The story starts in April 1992.It was during that time that Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) arrives in a remote area of the Denali National Park and Preserve in Alaska and sets up a campsite in an abandoned bus. At first, McCandless is content with the isolation, the beauty of nature around, and the thrill of living off the land. He hunts wild animals with a .22 caliber rifle, reads books, and keeps a diary of his thoughts as he prepares for himself a new life in the wild.Two years earlier in May 1990, McCandless graduates with high honors from Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. Shortly afterwards, McCandless rejects his conventional life by destroying all of his credit cards and identification documents. He donates nearly his entire savings of $24,000 to Oxfam and sets out on a cross-country drive in his well- used, but reliable Datsun to experience life in the wilderness. However, McCandless does not tell his parents Walt (William Hurt) and Billie McCandless (Marcia Gay Harden) nor his sister Carine (Jena Malone) what he is doing or where he is going, and refuses to keep in touch with them after his departure, leaving them to become increasingly anxious and eventually desperate.Years later at the abandoned bus, life for McCandless becomes harder and he becomes less discerning. As his supplies begin to run out, McCandless realizes that nature is also harsh and uncaring. In the pain of realization, McCandless concludes that true happiness can only be found when shared with others and seeks to return from the wild to his friends and family. However, he finds that the stream he had crossed during the winter has become wide, deep, and violent due to the thaw, and thus he is unable to cross. Saddened, McCandless returns to the bus, now as a prisoner who is no longer in control of his fate and can only hope for help from the outside. In a desperate act, McCandless is forced to gather and eat roots and plants, but he confuses similar plants and becomes ill as a result. Slowly dying, McCandless continues to document his process of self-realization and accepts his fate, as he imagines his family for one last time. He writes a farewell to the world and crawls into his sleeping bag to die. Two weeks later, his body is found by moose hunters. Shortly afterwards, Carine returns her brother's ashes by airplane from Alaska to Virginia in her backpack.This film is has a powerful message about the effects of our uncompromising choices in life;a person's search for identity and place in this world; and most of all,that people need to connect with one another in this journey called life especially with one's family.Those are the things that McCandless realized at the time of his death.Too bad,that he never knew them until he had gone to the wilderness.Aside from that,this movie is a character study of Christopher Johnson McCandless.When one sees the film,you either love him or hate him. It never presented him a hero or a martyr for his philosophical ideas nor idealism.It also presented him as a selfish person who wanted to inflict pain in his family as he was probably on conscious 'suicide journey' into the wilderness.The confusion it brings is what makes the movie a great one.A viewer can relate to him one way or another.It was truly one of the best films I have seen in myself.Sean Penn has simply created one of the best films that a person could relate to especially in his search for the meaning of life.",10,1,2,14 October 2011
Annie Hall," A Great Classic About Relationships
","Annie Hall is a romantic comedy that stars Woody Allen and Diane Keaton.It was co-written by both Marshall Brickman and Allen as well about the up and down relationship of two mismatched pairs in New York. The film is also directed by Allen that makes Annie Hall the great 'Woody Allen classic'.The story is about a Jewish comedy writer Alvy Singer,portrayed by Allen ,ponders the modern quest for love and his past romance with tightly- wound singer Annie Hall,played by Diane Keaton. The twice-divorced Alvy knows that it's not easy to find a mate when the options include pretentious New York intellectuals and lifestyle-obsessed Rolling Stone writers, but Annie seems different. Along the rocky road of their coupling, Allen and Alvy romance weigh in on such topics as endless therapy, movies versus TV, the absurdity of dating rituals, anti- Semitism, drugs, and, in one of the best set pieces, repressed Midwestern WASP insanity versus crazy Brooklyn Jewish boisterousness. Annie wants to move to Los Angeles to find that fame that finally does in the relationship but not before Alvy gets in a few digs at vacuous, mantra-fixated California.In the end,Alvy and Annie end up with different lovers.This is of the best movies I have ever seen.It is a film that is characterized by great humor and great performance by both Allen and Diane Keaton in her Oscar-winning performance.Also,the movie takes a look at relationships at both male and female perspectives as well as the differences from each other and the problems and obstacles to make it work.Aside from that,the story consists of many arguments and reconciliations that both Alvy and Annie has had only to find out how two different people can never be together and sacrifices have to be made to make one relationship work. Definitely,the movie was full of smarts and wits together with humor that makes the picture a great classic and the four Academy Awards it won for Best Actress for Keaton,Best Picture,Best Original Screenplay and Best Director not only proves that but cements its place in modern cinema.",10,1,2,29 October 2011
2001: A Space Odyssey," An Epic Sci-Fi Film
","2001: A Space Odyssey is a science fiction film produced and directed by Stanley Kubrick. It was co-written by Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, partially inspired by Clarke's short story 'The Sentinel'. The story deals with a series of encounters between humans and mysterious black monoliths that are apparently affecting human evolution, and a space voyage to Jupiter tracing a signal emitted by one such monolith found on the moon. Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood star as the two astronauts on this voyage, with Douglas Rain as the voice of the sentient computer HAL 9000 who has full control over their spaceship.At the 'Dawn of Man,' a group of hominids encounters a mysterious black monolith alien to their surroundings. To the strains of Strauss's 1896 Also sprach Zarathustra, a hominid invents the first weapon, using a bone to kill prey. As the hominid tosses the bone in the air, Kubrick cuts to a 21st century spacecraft hovering over the Earth, skipping ahead millions of years in technological development. U.S. scientist Dr. Heywood Floyd travels to the moon to check out the discovery of a strange object on the moon's surface: a black monolith. As the sun's rays strike the stone, however, it emits a piercing, deafening sound that fills the investigators' headphones and stops them in their path. Cutting ahead 18 months, impassive astronauts David Bowman and Frank Poole head toward Jupiter on the spaceship Discovery, their only company three hibernating astronauts and the vocal, man-made HAL 9000 computer running the entire ship. When the all-too-human HAL malfunctions, however, he tries to murder the astronauts to cover his error, forcing Bowman to defend himself the only way he can. Free of HAL, and finally informed of the voyage's purpose by a recording from Floyd, Bowman journeys to 'Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite,' through the psychedelic slit-scan star-gate to an 18th century room, and the completion of the monolith's evolutionary mission.The film is frequently described as an 'epic film', both for its length and scope, and for its affinity with classical epics.With assistance from special-effects expert Douglas Trumbull, Kubrick spent over two years meticulously creating the most 'realistic' depictions of outer space ever seen, greatly advancing cinematic technology for a story expressing grave doubts about technology itself. Despite some initial critical reservations that it was too long and too dull, 2001 became one of the most popular films of 1968, underlining the generation gap between young moviegoers who wanted to see something new and challenging and oldsters who 'didn't get it.' Provocatively billed as 'the ultimate trip,' 2001 quickly caught on with a counterculture youth audience open to a contemplative (i.e. chemically enhanced) viewing experience of a film suggesting that the way to enlightenment was to free one's mind of the U.S. military-industrial-technological complex.The film's projections of the cold war and antiquated product placements may look quaint now, but the poetry is as hard-edged and full of wonder as ever.But nevertheless,it is an extraordinary, obsessive, beautiful work of art.One of the most influential of all sci-fi films -- and one of the most controversial -- Stanley Kubrick's 2001 is a delicate, poetic meditation on the ingenuity -- and folly -- of mankind.",10,1,3,7 March 2012
Toy Story," Toy Story Reinvigorates Movie Animation
","Toy Story is a computer animated comedy produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures.It was the first feature length computer animated film and the first film produced by Pixar. Toy Story follows a group of anthropomorphic toys who pretend to be lifeless whenever humans are present, and focuses on Woody, a pullstring cowboy doll, and Buzz Lightyear, an astronaut action figure . Woody feels profoundly threatened and jealous when Buzz supplants him as the top toy in the room. The film was written and directed by John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen, Alec Sokolow, and Joss Whedon, and featured music by Randy Newman. The star of the proceedings is Woody, a pull-string cowboy toy belonging to a wide-eyed youngster named Andy. Whenever Andy's out of the room, Woody revels in his status as the boy's number one toy. His supremacy is challenged by a high-tech, space-ranger action figure named Buzz Lightyear, who, unlike Woody and his pals, believes that he is real and not merely a plaything. The rivalry between Woody and Buzz hilariously intensifies during the first half of the film, but when the well-being of Andy's toys is threatened by a nasty next-door neighbor kid named Sid whose idea of fun is feeding stuffed dolls to his snarling dog and reconstructing his own toys into hideous mutants such as Woody and Buzz join forces to save the day. There is greatness in film that can be discussed, dissected, and talked about late into the night. Then there is genius that is right in front of our faces--we smile at the spell it puts us into and are refreshed, and nary a word needs to be spoken. This kind of entertainment is what they used to call 'movie magic,' and there is loads of it in this irresistible computer animation feature. Just a picture of these bright toys reawaken the kid in us. Filmmaker John Lasseter thinks of himself as a storyteller first and an animator second, much like another film innovator, Walt Disney.Lasseter's story is universal and magical: what do toys do when they're not played with? He further scores with perfect voice casting that includes Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz,Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head and Wallace Shawn as a meek dinosaur. As entertaining as it is innovative, it kicked off Pixar's unprecedented run of quality pictures, reinvigorating animated film in the process.",10,1,1,19 October 2012
Blood Diamond," Oscar-worthy Performances Saves The Movie
","A South African mercenary and a Mende fisherman find their fates forever intertwined as they embark on a quest to obtain a rare and highly coveted pink diamond in director Edward Zwick's frantic adventure drama entitled Blood Diamond.It is a political thriller film co-produced and directed by Zwick that features Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Connelly and Djimon Hounsou. The title refers to blood diamonds, which are diamonds mined in African war zones and sold to finance conflicts, and thereby profit warlords and diamond companies across the world.Set during the Sierra Leone Civil War in 1992-2002, the film shows a country torn apart by the struggle between government soldiers and rebel forces.It also portrays many of the atrocities of that war, including the rebels' amputation of people's hands to discourage them from voting in upcoming elections.Ripped from his family farm and forced to toil away in the sweltering South African diamond fields, Solomon Vandy discovered an extraordinary rough stone of immeasurable value. Danny Archer is a hired gun who specializes in the sale of so-called 'blood diamonds' that are used to finance rebellions and terrorist organizations, and is currently serving time for smuggling. As a bloody civil war rages in Sierra Leone and Archer learns that Vandy has safely hidden the diamond in a place where no one would ever suspect, the pair enlist the aid of disillusioned American journalist Maddy Bowen in recovering the treasure that has the power to save Vandy's family and provide the desperate Archer with a much-needed chance for redemption.The film's ending, in which a conference is held concerning blood diamonds, is in reference to an actual meeting that took place in Kimberley, South Africa in 2000 and led to the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, which seeks to certify the origin of diamonds in order to curb the trade in conflict diamonds.The film is redeemed by its solid and Oscar-worthy performances as it overcomes poor storytelling with its biting commentary and fine performances.It was excitingly well made but formulaic.It was unfortunate disappointment due to heavy handed direction by Zwick which dilutes its message.Thanks to Mr. DiCaprio's raffishly dashing soldier of fortune, the movie is worth watching despite of its many negative qualities.Overall,it is still a good view but one should not expect a masterpiece out of it.",9,2,2,11 January 2012
The Graduate," The Graduate Is A Classic
","The Graduate is a comedy-drama film directed by Mike Nichols.It is based on the novel,The Graduate by Charles Webb. The screenplay was by Buck Henry and Calder Willingham. The film tells the story of Benjamin Braddock,played by Dustin Hoffman, a recent university graduate with no well-defined aim in life, who is seduced by an older woman, Mrs. Robinson,portrayed by Anne Bancroft, and then proceeds to fall in love with her daughter Elaine,played by Katharine Ross.Mentally adrift the summer after graduating from college, suburbanite Benjamin Braddock would rather float in his parents' pool than follow adult advice about his future. But the exhortation of family friend Mr. Robinson to seize every possible opportunity inspires Ben to accept an offer of sex from icily feline Mrs. Robinson. The affair and the pool are all well and good until Ben is pushed to go out with the Robinsons' daughter Elaine and he falls in love with her. Mrs. Robinson sabotages the relationship and an understandably disgusted Elaine runs back to college. Determined not to let Elaine get away, Ben follows her to school and then disrupts her family-sanctioned wedding. None too happy about her pre-determined destiny, Elaine flees with Ben -- but to what?This film at once reflected the generation gap and also widened it, giving youths a clear voice, indigenous music, all adults portrayed as villains, and a sympathetic anti-hero, played to perfection by Dustin Hoffman in a career-making turn. Also,it remains relevant at present especially with new graduates who experience post-college burnout feeling as exposed in this film.Also,it provides a comedy of tragedy in which a man's youthful idealism is dealt its inevitable deathblow.That is why it is a classic.",10,1,1,9 September 2012
Pride & Prejudice," A Gorgeous And Well-Acted Adaptation
","Jane Austen's perennially popular story of the game of love among the British upper classes returns to the screen in this polished film adaptation entitled,Pride And Prejudice.It depicts five sisters from an English family of landed gentry as they deal with issues of marriage, morality and misconceptions. Keira Knightley stars in the lead role of Elizabeth Bennet, while Matthew Macfadyen plays her romantic interest Mr. Darcy. Brenda Blethyn,Donald Sutherland,Tom Hollander,Rosamund Pike,Jena Malone and Judi Dench play key supporting roles. The Bennets are the parents of five daughters near the close of the 18th century. Comfortable within their means but well short of rich, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are looking for suitable husbands for their girls, and they are encouraged to learn that an eligible young bachelor from a wealthy family, Charles Bingley, has moved into a nearby estate. Eager to see if a match can be made, the Bennets bring their daughters Elizabeth and Jane to a ball thrown by their new neighbor to see if sparks will fly. Jane seems to like Charles, and he appears to feel the same, but Elizabeth takes an immediate dislike to Darcy, Charles' egocentric best friend. While Elizabeth is infatuated with military man Lt. Wickham and finds herself courted by William Collins, a well-meaning but drab man of the cloth, fate causes Elizabeth and Darcy to frequently cross paths, and while they don't care for one another, they can't stop thinking about each other, either.As historically authentic-looking as Pride & Prejudice is, it has far more invested in emotional authenticity as you feel engaged every moment.It is a boisterous, loud, dance-mad kind of place, full of ruddy- faced peasants, dirt and hay. The whole thing feels like it was art- directed by Bruegel on holiday.Also,it's a great adaptation of cinema's fave Jane Austen novel, but key performances and a modern film- making sensibility make this familiar period piece fresh and enjoyable.Finally,it is a gorgeous and well-acted adaptation.",10,1,4,13 October 2012
Singin' in the Rain," From Silent Films To Talkies
","Singin' in the Rain is a comedy musical film starring Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds and directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, with Kelly also providing the choreography. It offers a comic depiction of Hollywood, and its transition from silent films to 'talkies.'Hollywood, 1927: the silent-film romantic team of Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont is the toast of Tinseltown. While Lockwood and Lamont personify smoldering passions on screen, in real life the down-to-earth Lockwood can't stand the egotistical, brainless Lina. He prefers the company of aspiring actress Kathy Selden, whom he met while escaping his screaming fans. Watching these intrigues from the sidelines is Cosmo Brown, Don's best pal and on-set pianist. Cosmo is promoted to musical director of Monumental Pictures by studio head R.F. Simpson when the talking-picture revolution commences. That's all right for Cosmo, but how will talkies affect the upcoming Lockwood-Lamont vehicle 'The Dueling Cavalier'? Don, an accomplished song-and-dance man, should have no trouble adapting to the microphone. Lina, however, is another matter; put as charitably as possible, she has a voice that sounds like fingernails on a blackboard. The disastrous preview of the team's first talkie has the audience howling with derisive laughter. Watching Singin' in the Rain is an exuberant, magical experience -- a journey deep into the heart of feel-good territory.On the strength of the plot alone, concocted by the matchless writing team of Betty Comden and Adolph Green, Singin' in the Rain is a delight. But with the addition of MGM's catalog of Arthur Freed-Nacio Herb Brown songs -- 'You Were Meant for Me,' 'You Are My Lucky Star,' 'The Broadway Melody,' and of course the title song -- the film becomes one of the greatest Hollywood musicals ever made.Clever, incisive, and funny, Singin' in the Rain is a masterpiece of the classical Hollywood musical.",10,1,3,6 March 2012
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Another Take On Love
","Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a romantic science fiction film about an estranged couple who have each other erased from their memories, scripted by Charlie Kaufman and directed by the French director, Michel Gondry. The film uses elements of science fiction, psychological thriller, and nonlinear narration to explore the nature of memory and romantic love.Kaufman and Gondry worked on the story with Pierre Bismuth, a French performance artist. The film stars an ensemble cast starring Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Tom Wilkinson, Elijah Wood, Jane Adams, and David Cross.The second feature from Gondry finds the filmmaker re-teaming with screenwriter Charlie Kaufman for this off-the-wall romantic comedy. Emotionally withdrawn Joel Barish and unhinged free spirit Clementine Kruczynski strike up a relationship on a Long Island Rail Road train from Montauk, New York. They are drawn to each other on account of their radically different personalities.Although they apparently do not realize it at the time, Joel and Clementine are in fact former lovers, now separated after having spent two years together. After a nasty fight, Clementine hired the New York City firm Lacuna, Inc. to erase all her memories of their relationship. Upon discovering this, Joel is devastated and decides to undergo the procedure himself, a process that takes place while he sleeps.Much of the film takes place in Joel's mind. As his memories are erased, Joel finds himself revisiting them in reverse. Upon seeing happier times of his relationship with Clementine from earlier in their relationship, he struggles to preserve at least some memory of her and his love for her. Despite his efforts, the memories are slowly erased, with the last memory of Clementine telling him: 'Meet me in Montauk'.In separate but related story arcs occurring during Joel's memory erasure, the employees of Lacuna are revealed to be more than peripheral characters. Patrick, one of the Lacuna technicians performing the erasure, is dating Clementine while viewing Joel's memories, and copying Joel's moves to seduce her. Mary, the Lacuna receptionist, turns out to have had an affair with Dr. Howard Mierzwiak, the married doctor who heads the company—a relationship which she agreed to have erased from her memory when it was discovered by his wife. Once Mary learns this, she quits her job and steals the company's records, then sends them out to all clients of the company.Joel and Clementine come upon their Lacuna records shortly after re- encountering each other on the train. They react with shock and bewilderment, given that they have no clear memory of having known each other, let alone having had a relationship and having had their memories erased. Joel tries to convince Clementine that they can start over, but Clementine states that it could end the same way. Joel accepts this, and they decide to attempt a relationship anyway, starting their life together anew.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a wonderful, often beautiful, and melancholy character study of romance, humanity, and the mind with wonderful acting, incredible surrealism and a funny and heart-wrenching story.It's the kind of film that could mean more to people after they've left the theater and thought about it awhile for it is the perfect movie about love's inevitable imperfections. Aside from that,it entertains for the most part and gives us a set of marvelous performances from this outstanding cast, even if it doesn't quite reach the near-genius of Kaufman's other writings.Indeed,it provides another take on love that would definitely bring out all the weirdness of the premise, sometimes eliciting disbelieving laughter, sometimes taking us to odd, chilly places.",10,1,2,25 February 2012
Elysium," A Parable Of the Have Vs. Have Nots
","Elysium is science fiction that takes place on both a ravaged Earth and a luxurious space habitat called Elysium. It explores political and sociological themes such as immigration, health care and class issues. It stars Matt Damon and Jodie Foster; and it was written, co-produced and directed by Neill Blomkamp.The story takes place in the mid-22nd century particularly in 2154. An overpopulated, polluted Earth has been abandoned by its wealthiest citizens for Elysium, a Stanford torus space station paradise. Those who remain on the planet are manual laborers, criminals, and those struggling to make a living while looking up in the sky with envy where advanced medical care is available for all, the lawns are immaculately groomed, and there's no crime whatsoever. Its opening moments dramatize this with a series of captivating visuals contrasting the cramped, grimy environment of Los Angeles which does not compared the beauty of Elysium. Max DeCosta is an ex-car thief who has gone straight. On parole, he has left behind his old life and gotten a regular job. After a workplace accident, Max finds himself having a terminal illness. He has five days to live unless he discovers a way to get to Elysium and gain access to its advanced medical facilities. Under normal circumstances, this would doable but Secretary of Defense Delacourt is organizing a coup with the help of billionaire John Carlyle.It potentially destabilizes the political system and putting Elysium in a state of high alert. Plus, Max doesn't have the money necessary to buy passage on an illegal shuttle so he is forced to agree to go on a dangerous mission which it to kidnap the billionaire. The task is made more challenging by the arrival of Delacourt's unbalanced 'operative,' Kruger.Elysium is a parable between the Haves vs. Have Nots. Also,it is a visual spectacle which is a testament to Blomkamp's extraordinary skill as a visual filmmaker. Inspite of its opening interesting premise,the story becomes somewhat clichéd and predictable as it comes into the conclusion.Also,it goes overboard with loud, jerky, repetitive action sequences.Also,the inevitable climactic square off between Max and Kruger as slips into the Hollywood generic.This film had a great potential to become a great film but unfortunately with the stated reasons above it just manages to be entertaining and satisfying. But nevertheless,this summer movie sci-fi is easily the best thing out there right now for it is thrilling and exciting.",9,2,9,12 August 2013
Once Upon a Time in America," A Great Cinematic Experience And Masterpiece
","Once Upon a Time in America is an Italian epic crime film co-written and directed by Sergio Leone.It stars Robert De Niro and James Woods together with Elizabeth McGovern,William Forsythe,James Hayden,Tuesday Weld,Treat Williams,Joe Pesci,Burt Young and Brian Bloom. The film chronicles the story of the lives of Jewish ghetto youths who rise to prominence in New York City's world of organized crime. It explores themes of childhood friendships, love, lust, greed, betrayal, loss, broken relationships, and the rise of mobsters in American society.Leone adapted the story from the novel The Hoods, written by Harry Grey, while filming Once Upon a Time in the West. From there, Leone began production of Once Upon a Time in America. Once Upon a Time in America is done in non-linear order. While this plot states the film from the 20's to the 60's the film is largely told through flashbacks from the 60's.Spanning four decades, the film tells the story of David 'Noodles' Aaronson and his Jewish pals, chronicling their childhoods on New York's Lower East Side in the 1920s, through their gangster careers in the 1930s, and culminating in Noodles' 1968 return to New York from self-imposed exile, at which time he learns the truth about the fate of his friends and again confronts the nightmare of his past. The acting, the re-creation of the time period, the cinematography, and the music are all superb. However, even more important is Leone's ability to make the film work on so many different levels: it's both a criticism of gangster-film mythology and a continuation of the director's exploration of the issues of time and history. Strange as it may seem, the violence and gore in the first half of the film turn into a sad elegy about wasted lives and lost love. Once Upon a Time in America is visually stunning, stylistically bold, and emotionally haunting.Also,it is filled with great performances from its cast especially Robert De Niro,Tuesday Weld and James Woods.Obviously,Sergio Leone created a cinema masterpiece that is a self-reflexive crime-gangster epic that glorifies its lifestyle.Also,it has many wonderful, memorable moments in the movie that it conveys a lifetime of experience as it unfolds.Overall,Once Upon a Time in America is a cinema experience that one should have when viewing this undisputed masterpiece.",10,2,5,10 November 2011

Avatar," More Impressive On Technical Level Than Storytelling
","Avatar is an epic science fiction film written and directed by James Cameron, and starring Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez, Joel David Moore, Giovanni Ribisi and Sigourney Weaver. The film is set in the mid-22nd century, when humans are mining a precious mineral called unobtanium on Pandora, a lush habitable moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system.The expansion of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of a local tribe of Na'vi—a humanoid species indigenous to Pandora. The film's title refers to the genetically engineered Na'vi-human hybrid bodies used by a team of researchers to interact with the natives of Pandora.The film was shot on the proprietary FUSION digital 3D cameras developed by Cameron in collaboration with Vince Pace, and offers a groundbreaking mix of live-action dramatic performances and computer-generated effects. The revolutionary motion-capture system created for the film allows the facial expressions of actors to be captured as a virtual camera system enables them to see what their computer-generated counterparts will be seeing in the film, and Peter Jackson's Oscar-winning Weta Digital visual-effects house supervises Avatar's complex special effects.A paraplegic ex-marine finds a new life on the distant planet of Pandora, only to find himself battling humankind alongside the planet's indigenous Na'vi race in this ambitious digital 3D sci-fi epic from Academy Award-winning Titanic director James Cameron. The film, which marks Cameron's first dramatic feature since Titanic, follows Jake Sully, a war veteran who gets called to the depths of space to pick up the job of his slain twin brother for the scientific arm of a megacorporation looking to mine the planet of Pandora for a valued ore. Unfortunately the biggest deposit of the prized substance lies underneath the home of the Na'vi, a ten-foot-tall, blue-skinned native tribe who have been at war with the security arm of the company, lead by Col. Miles Quaritch. Because of the planet's hostile atmosphere, humans have genetically grown half-alien/half-human bodies which they can jack their consciousnesses into and explore the world in. Since Jake's brother already had an incredibly expensive Avatar grown for him, he's able to connect with it using the same DNA code and experience first- hand the joys of Pandora while giving the scientific team, led by Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) and Norm Spellman, some well-needed protection against the planet's more hostile forces.On a chance meeting after getting separated from his team, Jake's Avatar is rescued by Neytiri, a Na'vi princess, who brings him into her tribe in order to give the humans a second chance at relating to this new environment. When word gets out of his increasing time with the alien species, Quaritch enlists Jake to do some reconnaissance for the company, as they'd like to persuade the tribe to move their home before taking more drastic measures to harness the treasure hidden below. Yet as Jake becomes one with the tribe and begins to understand the secrets of Pandora, his conscience is torn between his new adopted world and the wheelchair-bound one awaiting him when the psychic connection to his Avatar is broken. Soon battle lines are drawn and Jake needs to decide which side he will fight on when the time comes. Spiritually moving, visually daring and emotionally stirring, Avatar is classic storytelling at its very best.As a fantasy epic, Avatar is an undeniable victory but outside of the narrow confines of immersion he's managed, it's also quite limited.The narrative would be ho-hum without the spectacle. But what spectacle! Avatar is dizzying, enveloping, vertiginous to that point that I ran out of adjectives an hour into its end credits.It might be more impressive on a technical level than as a piece of storytelling, but Avatar reaffirms James Cameron's singular gift for imaginative, absorbing filmmaking.",10,3,6,2 March 2012

","Chariots of Fire is a historical drama film.It stars Ben Cross and Ian Charleson together with Nigel Havers,Cheryl Campbell,Alice Krige and Ian Holm.It tells the fact-based story of two athletes in the 1924 Olympics: Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams.The film was written by Colin Welland and directed by Hugh Hudson.Eric Liddell, a serious Christian Scotsman, believes that he has to succeed as a testament to his undying religious faith. Harold Abrahams, is a Jewish Englishman who wants desperately to be accepted and prove to the world that Jews are not inferior. The film crosscuts between each man's life as he trains for the competition, fueled by these very different desires. As compelling as the racing scenes are, it's really the depth of the two main characters that touches the viewer, as they forcefully drive home the theme that victory attained through devotion, commitment, integrity, and sacrifice is the most admirable feat that one can achieve.The film manages to make effectively stirring use of its spiritual and patriotic themes.Like every element in this picture, the actors look right and they excel in their great performances.And to fully appreciate it,one does not have to a deep appreciation of sports but merely an understanding of human nature.And although this it has been released more than 30 years ago,it has proved time and again that this is a timeless story.",10,4,5,20 September 2012
Victory," One Of The Most Memorable Sports Picture Released
","The film,Victory is a story about Allied prisoners football players. A team of Allied prisoners of war (POWs), coached and represented by Englishman Captain John Colby agree to play an exhibition match against a German team, only to find themselves involved in a German propaganda stunt.He is the captain and essentially the manager of the team and thus chooses his squad of players.American POW Hatch is not initially chosen, but eventually nags the reluctant Colby into letting him on the team.The superior officers repeatedly try to convince Colby to use the match as an opportunity for an escape attempt,but he refuses,fearing that such an attempt will only result in getting his players killed. Meanwhile, Hatch has been planning an unrelated escape attempt,and Colby's superiors agree to help him, if he in return agrees to journey to Paris, make contact with the French Resistance, and try to convince them to help the soccer team escape.He succeeds in escaping the prison camp, traveling to Paris, and finding the Resistance, but the Resistance decides that the plan to help the soccer team escape is too risky; they not only refuse to help, but also convince Hatch to get re-captured, so he can pass information along back to the leading British officers at the prison camp.Fearing another escape attempt, the Germans initially refuse to allow Hatch to participate in the match, but Colby breaks the existing goalkeeper's arm as an excuse to get Hatch back onto the team.The match officials being heavily biased towards the Germans, and the German team causing several deliberate injuries to the Allied players, a draw is achieved.Hatch plays goalkeeper, and makes excellent saves including one last save from a penalty kick as time expires to deny the Germans the win, drawing the game 4–4. Before the penalty kick the POWs had scored a goal which was disallowed by the referee for a dubious offside decision, making the score 5–4, prompting the crowd to shout 'VICTORY!!!'They manage to escape at the end of the game, amidst the confusion caused by the crowd storming the field after it ends in a draw.Victory maybe a have all the elements of an underdog sports picture especially with a final match in the end,but it became a memorable one.One reason is that football happens to be arguably the most popular sport in the world.Also,the actors in the movie were well-known like Sylvester Stallone,who played Hatch;Michael Caine,who played Colby; and Max von Sydow.Finally,the film also has the participation of well-known football players like Bobby Moore, Osvaldo Ardiles, Kazimierz Deyna, Paul Van Himst, Mike Summerbee, Hallvar Thoresen and Pelé.John Huston's direction was also worth the mention.This is one excellent sports.A must-see for football fans and people who love the underdog.Also,it was one hell of an enjoyable and entertaining film.",9,7,7,12 October 2011

","The Artist is a romantic comedy drama in the style of a black-and-white silent film.It was written and directed by Michel Hazanavicius.It stars Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo together with John Goodman,James Cromwell,Missi Pyle,Penelope Ann Miller and Malcolm McDowell.The story takes place in Hollywood, between 1927 and 1932, and focuses on the relationship of an older silent film star and a rising young actress as silent cinema falls out of fashion and is replaced by the 'talkies'.In 1927, silent film star George Valentin is posing for pictures outside the premiere of his latest hit film, A Russian Affair, when a young woman, Peppy Miller, accidentally bumps into him. Valentin reacts with humor to the accident and shows off Peppy for the cameras. The next day, Peppy finds herself on the front page of Variety with the headline 'Who's That Girl?' Later, Peppy auditions as a dancer and is spotted by Valentin, who insists that she have a part in Kinograph Studios' next production, despite objections from the studio boss, Al Zimmer. While performing a scene together, Valentin and Peppy show great chemistry, despite her being merely an extra. With a little guidance from Valentin ,Peppy slowly rises through the industry, earning more prominent starring roles.Two years later, Zimmer announces the end of production of silent films at Kinograph Studios, but Valentin is dismissive, insisting that sound is just a fad. In a dream, Valentin begins hearing sounds from his environment, but cannot speak himself, then wakes up in a sweat. He decides to produce and direct his own silent film, financing it himself. The film opens on the same day as Peppy's new sound film as well as the 1929 Stock Market Crash. Now Valentin's only chance of avoiding bankruptcy is for his film to be a hit. Unfortunately audiences flock to Peppy's film instead and Valentin is ruined. His wife, Doris, kicks him out, and he moves into an apartment with his valet/chauffeur, Clifton, and his dog. Peppy goes on to become a major Hollywood star.One could spend hours talking about how fantastic The Artist is; how sublime Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo are; how natural their movements and expressions are; how perfect the score is so expressive and lively and jovial and magical.This is the definitive example of great that, it's essentially a tribute to black and white silent films.",10,2,4,21 October 2012
There's Something About Mary," An Unforgettable Comedy Made In The 90's
","There's Something About Mary is a comedic film that features Cameron Diaz in a star-making title role together with Matt Dillon and Ben Stiller.It is a film by the Farrelly brothers that combines romantic comedy and gross humor.The film starts when an awkward and shy 16-year-old high-school student named Ted Stroehmann lands a prom date with his dream girl Mary Jensen.Unfortunately,it was cut short by a painful and embarrassing zipper accident. After he suffers from the ordeal of pain and embarrassment, Ted end up in the hospital after the incident and loses touch with Mary.Thirteen years later, Ted is still in love.He hires a private investigator to find her and tries to win her once more now that it would be more challenging considering that he finds her a successful orthopedic surgeon residing in Miami. This was definitely an unforgettable film.One main reason is the fact that we here see a great looking,sexy and charming Cameron Diaz who is on her way to stardom before she changed into becoming the premiere actresses for bitches in movies such as The Counselor,Vanilla Sky and Charlie's Angels.Probably,it was also a time wherein she still signs autographs from fans.Anyway,she definitely portrayed the charm and appeal of Mary extremely well.As for the story,it was also able to handle romantic comedy and gross out humor together magnificently.While it maybe offensive and raunchy in many scenes,it also was able to become insightful when it comes to romance.Viewers will definitely feel the love that a romantic comedy rarely provides.Ben Stiller was definitely in top form during the production of the film.And most of all,give credit to the Farrelly brothers for arguably making their best film ever.In it,the movie makes fun of manners,political correctness,moral values and being polite but nevertheless they only made the viewer aware that we are capable of great sense of humor only known to us - human beings.The three reasons stated above makes it deserving of all the accolades and commercial success that it received during it theatrical release.",10,1,2,6 December 2014
Invictus," Nelson Mandela And Rugby
","Morgan Freeman portrays anti-apartheid activist and former South African president Nelson Mandela in this Clint Eastwood-helmed political drama adapted from author John Carlin's book The Human Factor: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Changed the World. Set just after the fall of apartheid and during Mandela's first term in office, The Human Factor explores how the political prisoner-turned-president used the 1995 Rugby World Cup -- which was hosted by South Africa -- as a means of bringing blacks and whites together after decades of violence and mistrust.This biographical sports drama is directed by Clint Eastwood and it co-stars Matt Damon.After 27 years in jail, Nelson Mandela is released in 1990 and subsequently elected President of South Africa. His immediate challenge is 'balancing black aspirations with white fears', as racial tensions from the apartheid era have not completely disappeared. While Mandela attempts to tackle the country's largest problems—crime and unemployment, among many others—he attends a game of the Springboks, the country's rugby union team. Mandela recognizes that the blacks in the stadium cheer against their home squad, as the Springboks represent prejudice and apartheid in their minds. Mandela remarks that he did the same while imprisoned on Robben Island. Knowing that South Africa is set to host the 1995 Rugby World Cup in one year's time, Mandela convinces a meeting of the newly-black-dominated South African Sports Committee to support the Springboks. He then meets with the captain of the Springboks rugby team, François Pienaar, and implies that a Springboks victory in the World Cup will unite and inspire the nation. Mandela also shares with Pienaar a poem, 'Invictus', that had inspired him during his time in prison.Pienaar and his teammates train. Many South Africans, both white and black, doubt that rugby will unite a nation torn apart by some 50 years of racial tensions. For many non-whites, especially the radicals, the Springboks symbolized white supremacy. However, both Mandela and Pienaar stand firmly behind their theory that the game can successfully unite the country.Things begin to change, however, as the players interact with the locals. This Clint Eastwood film provides a great theme and it is sentimental with inter-racial relations themes particularly in South Africa with the use of rugby - the country's primary sports.It provides inspiration as well together with a tribute to the country's great man in Nelson Mandela.Although it gathers Eastwood,top Hollywood actors and top South African actors,one thing about the movie is its lack of vitality and energy that would hold the viewer in watching it.Nevertheless,both Matt Damon as the captain of the Springboks rugby team, François Pienaar and Morgan Freeman as former South African president Nelson Mandela inhabit their real-life characters with admirable conviction.",10,1,2,31 December 2011

Mama," A Well-Shot Horror Film
","Mama is a horror film co-written and directed by Andrés Muschietti that stars Jessica Chastain and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau.

For five long years, their Uncle Lucas and his girlfriend, Annabel, have been madly searching for them. But when, incredibly, the kids are found alive in a decrepit cabin, the couple wonders if the girls are the only guests they have welcomed into their home. It delivers good old fashioned scares without cheap gross-out and even moves us by its surprising and effectively executed lengthy climactic sequence.Also,it is very European in its direction, aesthetic and narrative that it possesses a strong, emotional core that will surprise those jaded by some of the lazier horror titles of late.There are lots of shocks but no real surprises in it.But inspite of the clichés and overly repetitive plot structure,it is a well-played, well-shot horror flick as it doesn't treat audiences as naïve fools.It may not be a masterpiece and it is still worth your time because of it and Chastain's presence in the film.",9,1,3,4 April 2013

Bagley approaches him with an offer on behalf of a Japanese businessman, Mr. Omura (Masato Harada), to help train the new Western-style Imperial Japanese Army. Assisting them are Algren's old army colleague Sergeant Zebulon Gant (Billy Connolly) and Simon Graham (Timothy Spall).Under the command of Bagley, Algren and his companions travel to Japan. The newly-formed Japanese Army is a poorly-trained and equipped conscripted army of peasants totally lacking in combat experience. He does his best to remedy this, but before the men are trained to his satisfaction Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) attacks a railroad outside his province. Then,Bagley orders him to lead the inexperienced conscripts to engage Katsumoto. He then points out the army's inexperience and inadequate training. But Bagley dismisses his concerns and then orders a regiment to track down and engage Katsumoto. Yet when his ill-prepared superior force sets out too soon, their panic allows the sword-wielding samurai to crush them. Badly wounded Algren's courageous stand makes the samurai leader spare his life.Once nursed to health he learns to know and respect the old Japanese way, and participates as adviser.The acting in the movie is outstanding especially with Ken Watanabe as the samurai leader Katsumoto.He truly deserves the numerous nominations that he got from this movie.Aside from that,the movie is written very well as the history of the samurai is presented in way far from what normally people perceive them.Aside from that,the production values and battle scenes are worth mentioning.Overall,this movie presents the history of Japan in the 1800's with the ways of the samurai in particular.Highly recommended for people who loves movies about history and Japan.",9,1,1,9 October 2011

Life Is Beautiful," An Excellent And Outstanding Italian Tragicomedy
","Life Is Beautiful is an Italian film which tells the story of a Jewish Italian, Guido Orefice, who must employ his fertile imagination to help his family during their internment in a Nazi concentration camp.Guido was played by Roberto Benigni, who also directed and co-wrote the film.It also stars Nicoletta Braschi,Giorgio Cantarini,Giustino Durano and Sergio Bini Bustric.Life Is Beautiful is a tragicomedy that presents Guido, who moves during the 1930's from the country to a Tuscan town, where he is entranced by schoolteacher Dora. Dora likes Guido, but she remains faithful to her pompous fiancé, so Guido has an uphill struggle. Meanwhile, anti-Semitic attitudes lead to attacks against Guido's Jewish uncle. Leaping ahead to five years later, during WW II, Guido and Dora are married and have a son Giosue. After they are imprisoned in a concentration camp, Guido goes to elaborate lengths to keep his son from understanding the truth of their situation. He tells the boy that they are competing with others to win an armored tank -- so everything from food shortages to tattoos is explained as necessary for participation in the contest.Life Is Beautiful is a truly one unforgettable film.Although I find some of Benigni's slapstick a little bit over-the-top and forced,it still overcomes the message presented by the film as to the sacrifices a parent would do for their children.In this case,it was a child's innocence is worth protecting.It was also both poignant and sincere as well.Even though some viewers may consider it implausible or some form of manipulation,it nevertheless proves to be some sort of sensitive and touching especially when one tries to protect one from experiencing childhood trauma during the World War II Holocaust.It was definitely touching and a heartwarming story that would truly be unforgettable.",10,1,3,26 November 2011

That's okay; you'll want to see it a second time anyway.It was obviously another masterful work of art from Pixar, it is an exciting, hilarious, and heartfelt adventure impeccably crafted and told with wit and depth.",10,1,3,19 October 2012
The Hurricane," Denzel Washington Shines In The Hurricane
","The film,Hurricane,tells the story of boxer Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter, whose conviction for a Paterson, New Jersey triple murder was set aside after he had spent almost 20 years in prison.It stars Denzel Washington in the title role together with Vicellous Reon Shannon,Deborah Kara Unger,Liev Schreiber,John Hannah,Dan Hedaya,and Debbi Morgan.The script was adapted by Armyan Bernstein and Dan Gordon from the books Lazarus and the Hurricane by Sam Chaiton and Terry Swinton and The Sixteenth Round by Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter, and it was directed by Norman Jewison.Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter was a top-ranked middleweight boxer whom many fight fans expected to become world champion. When three people were shot to death in a bar in Paterson, New Jersey, Carter and his friend John Artis, driving home from another club in Paterson, were stopped and questioned by police. Although the police asserted that Carter and Artis 'were never suspects,' a man named Alfred Bello, himself a suspect in the killings, claimed that Carter and Artis were present at the time of the murders. On the basis of Bello's testimony, Carter and Artis were convicted of murder, and Carter was given three consecutive life sentences. Throughout the trial, Carter proclaimed his innocence, saying that his African-American race and work as a civil rights activist were the real reasons for his conviction. In 1974, Bello and Arthur Bradley, who also claimed that Carter was present at the scene of the crimes, recanted their testimony, but Carter and Artis were re-convicted. In the early 1980s, Brooklyn teenager Lesra Martin worked with a trio of Canadian activists to push the State of New Jersey to re-investigate Carter's case; in 1985, a Federal District Court ruled that the prosecution in Carter's second trial committed 'grave constitutional violations' and that his conviction was based on racism rather than facts. Carter was finally freed, and he summed up his story by saying, 'Hate got me into this place, love got me out.' This is a truly inspiring movie of a man who has suffered severely and managed to rise above the conditions that he has been through.Although the movie was criticized for misrepresenting many of the facts of Carter's life and the case itself, as documented in both his criminal and military records, and police reports and court documentation,it was a good movie that could serve inspiration to many people who have been against many odds and who have been barely managing to make ends meet in life. Denzel Washington gives an amazing performance as Rubin Carter as he captured the viewer's sympathy from the moment he appeared on screen until the end when he was freed.His performance was a powerful and compelling film. It was truly an expertly crafted, deeply moving biopic of an imprisoned boxer.",10,5,8,23 December 2011

He leads a small gang of thugs (Pete, Georgie, and Dim), whom he calls his droogs (from the Russian 'friend', 'buddy'). The film chronicles the horrific crime spree of his gang, his capture, and attempted rehabilitation via controversial psychological conditioning. Alex narrates most of the film in Nadsat, a fractured adolescent slang comprising Slavic (especially Russian), English, and Cockney rhyming slang.Stanley Kubrick dissects the nature of violence in this darkly ironic, near-future satire,complete with 'Nadsat' slang. Classical music-loving proto-punk Alex (Malcolm McDowell) and his 'Droogs' spend their nights getting high at the Korova Milkbar before embarking on 'a little of the old ultraviolence,' such as terrorizing a writer, Mr. Alexander (Patrick Magee), and gang raping his wife (who later dies as a result). After Alex is jailed for bludgeoning the Cat Lady (Miriam Karlin) to death with one of her phallic sculptures, Alex submits to the Ludovico behavior modification technique to earn his freedom; he's conditioned to abhor violence through watching gory movies, and even his adored Beethoven is turned against him. Returned to the world defenseless, Alex becomes the victim of his prior victims, with Mr. Alexander using Beethoven's Ninth to inflict the greatest pain of all. When society sees what the state has done to Alex, however, the politically expedient move is made. Casting a coldly pessimistic view on the then-future of the late '70s- early '80s, Kubrick and production designer John Barry created a world of high-tech cultural decay, mixing old details like bowler hats with bizarrely alienating 'new' environments like the Milkbar. Alex's violence is horrific, yet it is an aesthetically calculated fact of his existence; his charisma makes the icily clinical Ludovico treatment seem more negatively abusive than positively therapeutic. Alex may be a sadist, but the state's autocratic control is another violent act, rather than a solution. Stanley Kubrick's latest film takes the heavy realities of the 'do-your- thing' and 'law-and-order' syndromes, runs them through a cinematic centrifuge, and spews forth the commingled comic horrors of a regulated society.Disturbing and thought-provoking, A Clockwork Orange is a cold, dystopian nightmare with a very dark sense of humor.",10,1,4,2 March 2012
Woman in Gold," A Thought Provoking And Emotional Film About Art Restitution
","Woman In Gold is a remarkable true story about an Austrian woman and her lawyer's journey towards reclaiming her family's painting.This thought provoking true story of art restitution stars Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds together with Tatiana Maslany,Daniel Brühl and Katie HolmesThe screenplay written by Alexi Kaye Campbell and film directed by Simon Curtis was based on the story of the Maria Altmann,the late elderly Jewish refugee living in Los Angeles.She together with her young lawyer,Randy Schoenberg spent many years in battling the Austrian government to reclaim renowned Gustav Klimt's painting of her aunt,Adele Block-Bauer I,which was stolen by the Nazis at their home during World War II.This happens to be the Austria's version of Leonardo Da Vinci's Mona Lisa ans was considered a national treasure.Her legal journey ultimately reached the Supreme Court Of The United States which decided in her favor to pursue the case against Austria.It concluded when Restitution Board in Austria favored Altmann to get her painting back. In addition to her legal journey,it also presents the viewer Altmann's personal journey from being a part of a rich family in Austria until she and her husband escaped to the United States to avoid persecution by the Nazis during World War II.Despite the film's lack of energy,tension and surprises in telling a woman's fascinating legal and personal journey,the film somehow became a good one for many reasons.First,the performance of the cast especially of Mirren,Reynolds and Maslany were exemplary.Then,the legal journey that Altmann and Schoenberg took was definitely thought provoking especially when we get to see the intricacies they have to go through in order to move forward with every legal challenges they have to face.Evidently,the Austrian government exhausted all efforts to deny her getting her painting back and her young lawyer has to basically exhaust all efforts legally in order to help her.Finally,we also get to see a touching emotional battle that Maria has to go through in order to find resolution to the events of her life as flashback scenes unfold. Tatiana Maslany gave a credible performance as the young Maria Altman which overcame the confusion and haphazardness of the flashback scenes.These reasons are enough to make it entertaining and fine movie despite its drawbacks .",9,2,3,9 July 2015
Groundhog Day," An Entertaining Bill Murray Feature
","Groundhog Day is a comedy directed by Harold Ramis, starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell. It was written by Ramis and Danny Rubin, based on a story by Rubin.Bill Murray plays Phil, a TV weatherman working for a local station in Pennsylvania but convinced that national news stardom is in his grasp. Phil displays a charm and wit on camera that evaporates the moment the red light goes off; he is bitter, appallingly self- centered, and treats his co-workers with contempt, especially his producer Rita,played by Andie MacDowell; and cameraman Larry,portrayed by Chris Elliot.On February 2, 1992, Phil, Rita, and Larry are sent on an assignment that Phil especially loathes: the annual Groundhog Day festivities in Punxsutawney, PA, where the citizens await the appearance of Punxsutawney Phil, the groundhog who will supposedly determine the length of winter by his ability to see his own shadow. Phil is eager to beat a hasty retreat, but when a freak snowstorm strands him in Punxsutawney, he wakes up the next morning with the strangest sense of déjà vu: he seems to be living the same day over again. The next morning it happens again, and then again. Soon, no matter what he does, he's stuck in February 2, 1992; not imprisonment nor attempted suicide nor kidnapping the groundhog gets him out of the loop. But the more Phil relives the same day, the more he's forced to look at other people's lives, and something unusual happens: he begins to care about others. He starts to respect people, he tries to save the life of a homeless man, and he discovers that he's falling in love with Rita and therefore wants to be someone that she could love in return.Considering that none of the characters is fresh or interesting, it's a commendable achievement that the quality of the storytelling alone keeps the movie watchable and likable.Aside from that,Ramis' direction is often too cool and restrained as he wisely avoids playing into the tale's underlying sentimentality.Overall,it is an entertaining film, but it's also one that can subtly, obliquely inspire you to get out of your rut, do the right things, and move on with your life.",10,1,4,19 October 2012
National Treasure," A Fun Ride Indeed
","A man sets out to steal a lost fortune in order to save it in this adventure drama entitled,National Treasure.It is adventure heist film was written by Jim Kouf, Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, Cormac Wibberley, and Marianne Wibberley, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, and directed by Jon Turteltaub. It stars Nicolas Cage,who plays Benjamin Franklin Gates, a historian and amateur cryptologist searching for a lost treasure of precious metals, jewelry, artwork and other artifacts that was accumulated into a single massive stockpile by looters and warriors over many millennium starting in Ancient Egypt, later rediscovered by warriors who form themselves into the Knights Templar to protect the treasure, eventually hidden by American Freemasons during the American Revolutionary War.Diane Kruger,Jon Voight,Harvey Keitel,Sean Bean,Justin Bartha and Christopher Plummer co- star to play key supporting roles.Benjamin Franklin Gates is an archaeologist who is from the eighth generation of a family who has shared an unusual quest. As Gates-family legend has it, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin hid a massive cache of gold during the waning days of the Revolutionary War and left clues as to its whereabouts in the original drafts of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. With no firm proof that it actually exists, Gates sets out to crack the code that will lead him to the fortune, which, as a member of the Gates clan, he is sworn to protect from wrongdoers. National Treasure is no treasure, but it's a fun ride for those who can forgive its highly improbable plot.But nevertheless,it gets more entertaining as the more preposterous it gets and as its implausibility rises.Overall,it is more like a triple-cross between The DaVinci Code, CSI, and The Amazing Race than Raiders of the Lost Ark.",8,1,1,15 October 2012
Reservoir Dogs," Reservoir Dogs Makes Tarantino The Most Influential New Filmmaker In The 1990's
","Reservoir Dogs is a crime film marking debut of director and writer Quentin Tarantino. It depicts the events before and after a botched diamond heist, but not the heist itself. Reservoir Dogs stars an ensemble cast: Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, and Lawrence Tierney. Tarantino has a minor role, as does criminal-turned-author Eddie Bunker. It incorporates many themes that have become Tarantino's hallmarks: violent crime, pop culture references, profuse profanity, and a nonlinear storyline.The film has become a classic of independent film and a cult hit.The story looks at what happens before and after but not during a botched jewelry store robbery organized by Joe Cabot. Mr. White is a career criminal who takes a liking to newcomer Mr. Orange and enjoys showing him the ropes. Mr. Pink is a weaselly loner obsessed with professionalism. Mr. Blonde has just gotten out of jail after taking the rap on a job for Cabot; he's grateful for the work but isn't the same person he used to be. While Mr. Blonde goes nuts during the heist, the thieves are surprised by the sudden arrival of the police, and Mr. Pink is convinced one of their team is a cop. So who's the rat? What do they do about Mr. Blonde? And what do they do with Mr. Orange, who took a bullet in the gut and is slowly bleeding to death? Reservoir Dogs jumps back and forth between pre- and post-robbery events, occasionally putting the narrative on pause to let the characters discuss such topics as the relative importance of tipping, who starred in Get Christie Love!, and what to do when you enter a men's room full of cops carrying a briefcase full of marijuana. Reservoir Dogs transformed Quentin Tarantino practically overnight from an obscure screenwriter and part-time actor to the most influential new filmmaker of the 1990s for he has made a nihilist comedy about how human nature will always undercut the best-laid plans.Also,this undeniably impressive picture grabs the viewer by the lapels and shakes hard, but it also is about nothing other than a bunch of macho guys and how big their guns are.Aside from that,it has remained undoubtedly one of the best films of the 1990s, and probably one of the best directorial debuts of all time, Reservoir Dogs announced the arrival of one of contemporary cinema's hottest talents -- and he came out shooting.",10,1,1,3 March 2012
How to Train Your Dragon," An Animation Classic
","How to Train Your Dragon is a 3D computer-animated comedy-drama fantasy by DreamWorks Animation that was loosely based on the English book of the same title. It was directed by Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois, the duo who directed Disney's Lilo & Stitch. It features the voices of Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, Craig Ferguson, America Ferrera, Jonah Hill, T.J. Miller, Kristen Wiig, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and David Tennant.The story takes place in a mythical Viking world where a young Viking teenager named Hiccup aspires to follow his tribe's tradition of becoming a dragon slayer. After finally capturing his first dragon, and with his chance at finally gaining the tribe's acceptance, he finds that he no longer has the desire to kill it and instead befriends it.Hiccup is a failure as a Viking: skinny, inquisitive, and inventive, he asks questions and tries out unsuccessful contraptions when he's supposed to be fighting the dragons that attack his village. His father, chief Stoick the Vast, has pretty much given up on his teenage son and apprenticed him to blacksmith Gobber. Worse, Hiccup knows the village loser hasn't a chance of impressing Astrid, the girl of his dreams and a formidable dragon fighter in her own right. When one of Hiccup's inventions actually works, he hasn't the heart to kill the young dragon he's brought down. He names it Toothless and befriends it, although he's been taught to fear and loathe dragons. Codirectors and co-writers Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois, who made Disney's delightful Lilo and Stitch, provide plenty of action, including vertiginous flying sequences, but they balance the pyrotechnics with moments of genuine warmth that make the viewer root for Hiccup's success. Many DreamWorks films get laughs from sitcom one-liners and topical pop culture references; as the humor in Dragon comes from the characters' personalities, it feels less timely and more timeless. Toothless chases the spot of sunlight reflected off Hiccup's hammer like a giant cat with a laser pointer; Hiccup uses his newly found knowledge to defeat two small dragons and impress the other kids. How to Train Your Dragon will be just as enjoyable 10 or 20 years from now as it is today. Boasting dazzling animation, a script with surprising dramatic depth, and thrilling 3-D sequences,it soars!!!!!!",10,1,1,21 October 2012
The Great Raid," A Tribute To Americans And Filipinos During World War II
","The Great Raid is a World War II film about the Raid at Cabanatuan that located in the Philippines.It was adapted from William Breuer's book of the same name.It stars Benjamin Bratt, Joseph Fiennes, James Franco, Connie Nielsen, Motoki Kobayashi and Filipino actor,Cesar Montano. It tells the story of the liberation of the Cabanatuan Prison Camp by the US Military with the help of Filipino guerrillas.It is directed by John Dahl.During the waning days of World War II,General Douglas MacArthur chose to make good on a pledge that he made in 1942 that he would return to the Philippines after he and his troops were forced to retreat. However, MacArthur's determination was more than a matter of pride. Over 500 American soldiers were being held in Cabanatuan, a notoriously brutal prisoner of war camp in the Philippines operated by the Japanese army, and MacArthur wanted to see to it that they made it home. MacArthur chose Lt. Col. Henry Mucci to lead the Sixth Ranger Battalion on a mission 30 miles behind enemy lines to infiltrate Cabanatuan and liberate the American prisoners. With the help of Capt. Prince, Mucci leads his men on a life-or-death raid against forces known for their savagery with the help of Filipino guerrillas.The conclusion of the movie,which was the raid of the prison camp,was well-done by the filmmakers.Unfortunately,the film ran too long due to many subplots such as a love story before the raid.Had the film just focused on what it was suppose to be,it could have been shorter and probably would have become a brilliant film.The performances of the cast were worthy of merit especially Filipino actor,Cesar Montano in his first Hollywood film.In summary,The Great Raid would have become a great film had it focused on the raid itself.",8,2,3,31 October 2011
Limitless," A Cautionary Tale For Drug Addiction
","Bradley Cooper,Abbie Cornish and Robert DeNiro star in this American thriller entitled,Limitless. The film is about an aspiring author in Eddie Morra,who is suffering from writer's block.Leslie Dixon wrote the screenplay and Neil Burger directed it.Eddie Morra is consistently experiencing a writer's block which does not help him get a break as an aspiring author.But it became helpful when the estranged brother of his ex-wife,Melissa introduced him to a drug called NZT which enabled him to tap into his fullest potential.This motivated him to go into Wall Street and succeeds in the process as he turned a small amount of money into millions.This catches the attention of Carl Van Loon,who asked his help to broker the largest merger in corporate history.Unfortunately,the brutal side effects of the drug takes place and there is the dilemma that there are people after his stash of NZT.With his dwindling supply of the drug,he tries to escape from his enemies who are hunting him down.While the premise could be interesting before watching it,the film actually is full of implausibilities and impossibilities.Added to that,it was also uneven and one may even accuse the plot of being convoluted.But in spite of it,it was definitely entertaining as well as appealing.Credit Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro for a fantastic performance.Added to that,it has a lot of great special effects that lovers of CGI movies will surely enjoy.As far as the theme of the movie is concerned,it also serves as a great cautionary tale for drug addiction and how not to overuse drugs especially those that claim to help self-enhancement of certain abilities which the movie did probably just right in its attempt to be original in terms of story and screenplay.",9,1,1,30 September 2014
Rocky," The Greatest Underdog Movie Of All-Time
","When people think of movies about underdogs,the first thing that definitely would come to their minds is Rocky. It is a movie that tells the rags to riches American Dream story of Rocky Balboa, an uneducated but kind-hearted debt collector for a loan shark in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Rocky starts out as a club fighter who then suddenly gets a shot at the world heavyweight championship fight with Apollo Creed.The film stars Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa together with Talia Shire as Adrian, Burt Young as Adrian's brother Paulie, Burgess Meredith as Rocky's trainer Mickey Goldmill, and Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed. It was also written by Stallone,who became a major star after this film and directed by John Avildsen.The movie has become a big hit on the day it was released.Although the film was pure Hollywood as it was formulaic and predictable especially with the fight against Apollo Creed and Rocky Balboa,the movie was sincere and subtle in the telling of the story.Also,it was released at a time when the United States were facing economic difficulties. They needed a movie like this to provide them inspiration and hope in their daily lives.What unfortunately lacks subtlety is the execution of the performances of the cast especially by Sylvester Stallone inspite of his Oscar nomination for Best Actor.Many critics and fans have considered him the next Marlon Brando but unfortunately that is far from the truth at present.He definitely was a movie star for so many year due to the many films he made that made millions and not because of his acting abilities.But nevertheless,after watching this movie,I could fairly say that this was the best performance of this career.The other stars in the movie were decent.As for the legacy of this movie,it was not only well-known to be the greatest movie about underdogs.The music of Bill Conti especially the classic Rocky theme,'Gonna Fly Now' has not only been identified to Rocky but also to the sport of boxing.Arguably the it has maintained the popularity of boxing for so many years especially when Conti's music is played in boxing matches.Aside from that,Rocky gave way to many movie sequels such as Rocky's II,III,IV,V and Rocky Balboa - all that never came close to this movie. Definitely,it gave way to a successful movie franchise in the years to come.",10,1,2,23 October 2011

After watching his last film,he will surely be missed by the fans and movie industry.",9,5,7,9 October 2011
Pretty Woman," An Entertaining RomCom Introducing Julia Roberts
","This movie responsible for introducing to us Julia Roberts and into it is the reason that catapulted her into becoming a Hollywood icon.Aside from its famous song with the same title of the movie,I think that is the biggest reason why one should see this film.Aside from discovering Roberts' ability to act,another reason to watch this movie is to get entertained.That's it.Pretty Woman is a romantic comedy written by J.F. Lawton and directed by Garry Marshall.It features Richard Gere and Julia Roberts, and also Hector Elizondo, Ralph Bellamy, and Jason Alexander in supporting roles. Roberts played the only important female character as the prostitute Vivian Ward. The story of Pretty Woman centers on the down-on-her-luck Hollywood prostitute Vivian Ward who is hired by a wealthy businessman, Edward Lewis,played by Gere, to be his escort for several business and social functions, and their developing relationship over the course of Vivian's week-long stay with him.Self-involved corporate raider Edward Lewis has recently split up with his girlfriend. Seeking directions to the Beverly Hills Hotel, he makes the acquaintance of free-spirited hooker Vivian Ward and decides to put her on a 3,000-dollar retainer as his 'date.' He Cinderellarizes her by bankrolling a full wardrobe and cosmetic makeover. Of course, the setup will be strictly platonic but later on only to fall in love with one another.This film had a great performance from Julia Roberts.As charming as she is in her 'giggling' sequences, Roberts' best scene is her triumphant return to a posh Rodeo Drive shop where she'd been previously snubbed. She earned in this movie an Academy Award and a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress.Her presence definitely raised the level of this movie from other romantic comedies.Keeping Pretty Woman afloat throughout is the buoyant direction of Garry Marshall.It was widely successful at the box office, and it became one of the highest moneymakers of 1990. Today it is one of the most financially successful entries in the romantic comedy genre and an entertaining one at that as well.",9,1,2,22 October 2011
Some Like It Hot," Marilyn Monroe's Best Performance
","Some Like It Hot is a comedy film that was directed by Billy Wilder and it starred Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon and George Raft. The supporting cast includes Joe E. Brown, Pat O'Brien and Nehemiah Persoff. The film is a remake by Wilder and I. A. L. Diamond of a 1935 French movie, Fanfare d'Amour, from the story by Robert Thoeren and Michael Logan, which was itself remade in 1951 by German director Kurt Hoffmann as Fanfaren der Liebe. However, both the French and German films were without the gangsters that are an integral part of the plot of Some Like It Hot. Wilder's working title for his film was Fanfares of Love, then Not Tonight, Josephine before he decided on Some Like It Hot as its release title.The launching pad for Billy Wilder's comedy classic was a rusty old German farce, Fanfares of Love, whose two main characters were male musicians so desperate to get a job that they disguise themselves as women and play with an all-girl band in gangster-dominated 1929 Chicago. In this version, musicians Joe and Jerry lose their jobs when a speakeasy owned by mob boss Spats Columbo is raided by prohibition agent Mulligan. Several weeks later, on February 14th, Joe and Jerry get a job performing in Urbana and end up witnessing a gangland massacre in a parking garage. Fearing that they will be next on the mobsters' hit lists, Joe devises an ingenious plan for disguising their identities. Soon they are all dolled up and performing as Josephine and Daphne in Sweet Sue's all-girl orchestra. En route to Florida by train with Sweet Sue's band, the boys (or girls?) make the acquaintance of Sue's lead singer Sugar Kane. Joe and Jerry immediately fall in love, though of course their new feminine identities prevent them from acting on their desires. Still, they are determined to woo her, and they enact an elaborate series of gender-bending ruses complicated by the fact that flirtatious millionaire Osgood Fielding has fallen in love with 'Daphne.' The plot gets even thicker when Spats Columbo and his boys show up in Florida. Nominated for several Oscars, Some Like It Hot ended up the biggest moneymaking comedy up to 1959. Full of hilarious set pieces and movie in-jokes, it has not tarnished with time and in fact seems to get better with each passing year, as its cross-dressing humor keeps it only more and more up-to-date.This was also Marilyn Monroe's best performance in her legendary acting career.Overall,this comedy is one of the enduring treasures of the movies, a film of inspiration and meticulous craft for movies like this, with a sense of humor that is as broad as it can be sophisticated, come along only infrequently.",10,3,4,27 February 2012

This come from acclaimed director Spike Lee. Willem Dafoe,Chiwetel Ejiofor and Christopher Plummer co-star to play key supporting roles.Dalton Russell is a bank robber with a difference. In his quest to execute the perfect heist, Dalton has taken every possible factor into consideration. Dalton's uncanny ability of staying one step ahead of the law thwarts even-tempered Detective Keith Frazier's best efforts. But there's another factor at play. The bank president has requested the services of high-profile negotiator Madeline White. Despite her commendable track record, Madeline is something of a wild card, and before the day is over, this bank robbery will go down in history as one of the most elaborate heists ever executed. This energetic and clever bank-heist thriller touches on questions of race and class without taking away from the tension and fun of the cat- and-mouse games between a hostage negotiator, a bank robber, and a high- powered fixer. The film puts a spin on the Dog Day Afternoon scenario, with a group of sharp bank robbers who stay one step ahead of the police; it's a smart genre film that is not only rewarding on its own terms, but manages to subvert its pulpy trappings and it convoluted plot with wit and skill.",8,2,3,1 October 2012
Pulp Fiction," Pulp Fiction: A Great Movie
","Outrageously violent, time-twisting, and in love with language, Pulp Fiction was widely considered the most influential American movie of the 1990s. Director and co-screenwriter Quentin Tarantino synthesized such seemingly disparate traditions as the syncopated language of David Mamet; the serious violence of American gangster movies, crime movies, and films noirs mixed up with the wacky violence of cartoons, video games, and Japanese animation; and the fragmented story-telling structures of such experimental classics as Citizen Kane, Rashomon, and La jetÃ©e. This movie is a crime film directed by Quentin Tarantino, who co-wrote its screenplay with Roger Avary. The film is known for its rich, eclectic dialogue, ironic mix of humor and violence, nonlinear storyline, and host of cinematic allusions and pop culture references.It stars the following namely: John Travolta,Samuel L. Jackson,Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel,Tim Roth,Amanda Plummer,Maria de Medeiros,Ving Rhames,Eric Stoltz,Rosanna Arquette,Christopher Walken and Bruce Willis. The Oscar-winning script by Tarantino and Roger Avary intertwines three stories, featuring Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta, in the role that single-handedly reignited his career, as hit men who have philosophical interchanges on such topics as the French names for American fast food products; Bruce Willis as a boxer out of a 1940s B-movie; and such other stalwarts as Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman, whose dance sequence with Travolta proved an instant classic.This film is a spectacularly entertaining piece of pop culture.It could be considered the best film of the year it was released - 1994 - and of this decade in the 1990's.Also,it is a triumphant, cleverly disorienting journey through a demimonde that springs entirely from Mr. Tarantino's ripe imagination, a landscape of danger, shock, hilarity and vibrant local color.Obviously,this film is violent, profane and filled with addicts, racists and killers. At the same time, it may be one of the most moral stories the big screen has seen in years.Also,it was brilliantly written and unfathomably cool, this would make a good case for most quotable crime movie of all time.In summary,this is one great movie that is gives great entertainment as well as a stylish and foxy comedy of errors.",10,5,10,8 January 2012
Jack Reacher," A New Action Movie Franchise For Cruise
","Jack Reacher is a thriller that is an adaptation of Lee Child's novel One Shot. Written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, the film stars Tom Cruise as the title character together with Rosamund Pike,Richard Jenkins, Werner Herzog,David Oyelowo and Robert Duvall.One heartland city thrown into a state of terror. But within hours the cops have it solved: a slam-dunk case. Except for one thing. The accused man says: You got the wrong guy. Then he says: Get Reacher for me. And sure enough, ex-military investigator Jack Reacher is coming. He knows this shooter-a trained military sniper who never should have missed a shot. He is certain something is not right-and soon the slam-dunk case explodes. Now he is teamed with a beautiful young defense lawyer, moving closer to the unseen enemy who is pulling the strings. He knows that no two opponents are created equal. This one has come to the heartland from his own kind of hell. And he knows that the only way to take him down is to match his ruthlessness and cunning- and then beat him shot for shot.Jack Reacher is an above-average crime thriller.Obviously,Tom Cruise is starting a new action series after probably moving away from his Ethan Hunt character in the Mission Impossible franchise.This is solid, enjoyable, formula- driven stuff designed to self-replicate into a film series and nothing more.Reacher is a fascinating character, to be sure, both a virtuous crusader for justice and a cold-blooded killer.But having the character a darker edge in the future would make the film more interesting and enjoyable.",8,3,8,4 April 2013

"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," A Perfect Blend Of Intelligence,Humor And Suspense
","British writer Guy Ritchie made his feature directorial debut with this crime-caper comedy-drama set in London's East End and heavy on the Cockney dialogue in this movie entitled,Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. The story is a heist film involving a self-confident young card sharp who loses £500,000 to a powerful crime lord in a rigged game of three card brag. In order to pay off his debts, he and his friends decide to rob a small-time gang who happen to be operating out of the flat next door. The film brought Guy Ritchie international acclaim and introduced actors Vinnie Jones, a former Welsh international footballer, and Jason Statham, a former street merchant, to worldwide audiences.Jason Flemyng,Dexter Fletcher,Nick Moran,Steven Mackintosh and Sting co-star to play key supporting roles.A big-bucks scheme goes awry: Cardsharp Eddy and pals Bacon,Tom, and Soap scuffle to pile up enough money to put Eddy at the card table opposite gangland porn lord Hatchet Harry. Unfortunately, the whole plan backfires, leaving Eddy owing Harry a huge sum, payable within the week. In truth, Harry hopes to acquire the bar run by his rival, J.D., who is Eddy's father. To raise the cash, Eddy sets out to steal from a marijuana business run by Winston,but the inevitable gun play doesn't make for an easy heist. This is one of those movies that was destined to become an instant cult classic.Although some comparisons were drawn between Ritchie and Quentin Tarantino, it would be unfair to discount the brilliant wit of the story and the innovative camera-work that the director brings to his debut feature.Indicative of the social stratosphere in London, Ritchie's movie is a hilarious and at times touching account of friendships and loyalty. The director and his mates clearly are enjoying themselves here. This comes across in some shining performances, in particular from ex- footballer Vinnie Jones (Big Chris) and an over-the-top Vas Blackwood, who very nearly steals the show. Full of quirky vernacular and clever tension-packed action sequences,this movie is a triumph which is a perfect blend of intelligence, humor, and suspense.",10,1,4,22 October 2012

The plot spans 17 years and is set against a backdrop of political turmoil, which in the film culminates in the June Rebellion of France. This is a big story, with big themes about love, law and revolution in 19th-century France.Hugh Jackman is sensational as zero to hero Valjean. Few can sing, dance and act like him. Here, he combines all three to glorious effect.Despite its multiple Oscar nominations and wins like Anne Hathaway's win for Best Supporting Actress as well as its numerous accolades that it has garnered, it is bombastic, overblown, overlong, needlessly convoluted and full of simplistic characters. No question about it.But it runs too long that - and a half hours - and most of the dialogues are sung that one's big expectations may not be enough to get fully satisfied in it considering it should have been the movie event of the year. Inspite of its imperfections,it still manages to entertain especially loyal fans of the musical.",10,1,4,1 August 2013
The Da Vinci Code," The Novel Better Than Movie
","The Da Vinci Code is a movie that is an adaptation of Dan Brown's bestseller of the same title.It is a story of Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) who was called late at night at the Louvre museum where a curator has been found murdered.Together with French police cryptologist Sophie Neveu ( French actress Audrey Tautou),they solve a series of secrets hidden in the works of Leonardo Da Vinci which may unravel a religious secret that may shatter the foundations of Christian beliefs that has been held by man for more than 2000 years.It basically tells the viewer that Jesus fathered a child with Mary Magdalene and held a family line in France that was kept in secret by the Vatican and the Catholic group known as Opus Dei.The film softens its religious issues that was described in the book.It never discussed so much about the origins of the bible nor Jesus' divinity.Nobody who watched this film will definitely undergo any religious crisis.Also,the novel is a lot better than the film.I have to keep myself awake in its 2 hour and 46 minute run.But the visuals were great.It was shot in Paris,London and in Scotland.Great acting too.Tom Hanks was excellent as usual.Audrey Tatou is promising.Despite of its slow pacing brought about by too many talking among the characters,Ron Howard did a wonderful job of directing the film which basically based its most of its plot from the novel.Unfortunately,the film's script never lived up to the greatness of the book's story in terms of suspense.Anybody who read the book should not expect the same from the film.Highly recommended to anyone who loves good thrillers and who admires Tom Hanks as an actor.",8,2,3,13 October 2011
Titanic," There Is Nothing To Dislike In Titanic
","If there is one film that has the complete package and that could probably be appreciated by people from all walks of life,the 1997 movie,Titanic is it.No wonder it remains the highest-grossing film of all-time.Titanic is an epic film written and directed as well as co-produced, and co-edited by James Cameron.It stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson, Kate Winslet as Rose DeWitt Bukater and Billy Zane as Rose's fiancé,Cal Hockley.It also features Frances Fisher,Bill Paxton,Kathy Bates,Danny Nucci,Bernard Hill,Victor Garber and Gloria Stuart as the 100 year-old Rose.It is a fictionalized account of the sinking of the RMS Titanic wherein its passengers,Jack and Rose are members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage.Writer-director James Cameron employed state-of-the-art digital special effects for this production and realized it on a monumental scale that made the movie the most expensive to produce and the most successful box office hit to date.The story of Titanic involves American treasure-seeker Brock Lovett retrieving artifacts from the submerged ship. Lovett looks for diamonds but finds a drawing of a young woman, nude except for a necklace. When 100-year-old Rose reveals she's the person in the portrait, she is summoned to the wreckage site to tell her story of the 56-carat diamond necklace and her experiences of many years earlier. The scene then shifts to 1912 Southampton where passengers boarding the Titanic include penniless Jack Dawson and society girl Rose DeWitt Bukater, returning to Philadelphia with her wealthy fiancé Cal Hockley. After the April 10th launch, Rose develops a passionate interest in Jack, and Cal's reaction is vengeful. At midpoint in the film, the Titanic slides against the iceberg and water rushes into the front compartments. Even engulfed, Cal continues to pursue Jack and Rose as the massive liner begins its descent. After her story is complete,Rose goes alone to the stern of Lovett's ship and drops her jewelry known as Heart Of The Ocean into the sea.The movie remains the greatest and most spectacular demonstration of what modern technology can contribute to dramatic storytelling.Aside from that,it is an extraordinary achievement in film making wherein technology astounds but better yet the human story shines even brighter.Credit the performances of the talented cast especially DiCaprio,Winslet and Stuart.The story also touches all themes that possesses a winning combination of a tale that both modern and old- fashioned. Added to that,credit also goes to James Horner for the film for it was full of beauty and magical.'My Heart Will Go On',the movie's love theme that was composed by Horner and sung by Celine Dion,will always be memorable and treasured by viewers for many years to come. Overall,there is nothing to dislike in Titanic for it is a winner not only in every aspect of film making attested by the 11 Academy Awards it has won but for the taste of viewers all over the world alike.",10,2,4,29 October 2011
Rocky III," The Successful Comeback Of Rocky
","The third Rocky film now this time goes back to becoming the ultimate sports picture of the movie franchise.After it touched on the theme as the greatest underdog movie in the first and the love story between Rocky and Adrian in the second,Rocky III touches the most about Rocky becoming a sports figure - his rise,fall and successful comeback as boxer.Rocky III is the third installment in the Rocky film series.It is written and directed by Sylvester Stallone.He again stars as title character,Rocky Balboa together with Carl Weathers as former boxing rival Apollo Creed, Burgess Meredith as Rocky's trainer Mickey, and Talia Shire as Rocky's wife, Adrian.It also stars Mr.T, who plays Rocky's opponent is James 'Clubber' Lang,a younger and more aggressive boxer.The movie starts with the Italian Stallion so famous that his likeness is everywhere, including pinball machines. Fame and complacency soon cause Balboa to lose his title to young thug Clubber Lang,who inadvertently causes the death of Rocky's beloved trainer,Mickey before their first championship bout. After sinking into a depression,Balboa must regain the love and support of his family, as well as the elusive 'eye of the tiger,' the hungry need to beat the opponent which former foe Apollo Creed teaches him to regain his hunger and fighting spirit in the ring.In the end, Balboa faces off against Lang for a second time. Just as I have said,Rocky III is the ultimate sports picture of the Rocky movie franchise as it centers on his being an athlete.It definitely inspires viewers especially the young people to rise from defeat and downfalls as evidenced by Balboa in this picture.Aside from refreshing themes untouched in the first two,the movie also introduces a new single 'Eye of the Tiger,' the theme song Stallone commissioned from the band Survivor.It became a huge hit single and has also been attached to boxing matches for so many years now just like the original Rocky theme,'Gonna Fly Now'.Aside from the themes and hit single,the performances of the cast were commendable as well.Overall,the movie provides great entertainment but it falls short from being a masterpiece like the the first movie.Personally,I consider Rocky III the fourth-best in the franchise behind Rocky,Rocky Balboa and Rocky II in that order.",8,3,3,23 October 2011
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Harry Potter's A Complete Triumph
","Here's an event movie that holds up to being an event. This filmed version of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, adapted from the wildly popular book by J.K. Rowling, stunningly brings to life Harry Potter's world of Hogwarts, the school for young witches and wizards. The film is the first installment in the Harry Potter film series, written by Steve Kloves and produced by David Heyman. It features Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, with Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Harry's best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, John Cleese, and Fiona Shaw co-star to play key supporting roles.It was directed by Chris Columbus. The story follows Harry Potter's first year at Hogwarts as he discovers that he is a famous wizard and begins his magical education. Upon his 11th birthday, Harry Potter, who lives in misery with an aunt and uncle that don't want him, learns from a giant named Hagrid that he is the orphaned son of powerful wizards. Harry is offered a place at prestigious Hogwarts, a boarding school for wizards that exists in a realm of magic and fantasy outside the dreary existence of normal humans or 'Muggles.' At Hogwarts, Harry quickly makes new friends and begins piecing together the mystery of his parents' deaths, which appear not to have been accidental after all. Being so faithful to the book is both the movie's strength and weakness. The movie unfolds exactly as written in the book, so there is little room for surprises or discoveries.The greatest strength of the film comes from its faithfulness to the novel, and this new cinematic world is filled with all the details of Rowling's imagination, thanks to exuberant sets, elaborate costumes, clever makeup and visual effects, and a crème de la crème cast.A combination of computer graphics, detailed sets, and real-life locations gives the film the authenticity its fans expect.The second-half adventure doesn't translate perfectly from page to screen, ultimately because of the film's fidelity to the novel.This is a case of making a movie for the book's fans, as opposed to a transcending film. Writer Steve Kloves and director Chris Columbus keep the spooks in check, making this a true family film, and with its resourceful hero wide-eyed and ready, one can't wait for Harry's return.But nevertheless,it still manages to be a complete triumph for it is a near-perfect commercial and cultural commodity.",10,1,2,22 October 2012
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Harry Potter Series Continues To Improve
","Directed by Mike Newell, the fourth installment to the Harry Potter series finds Harry wondering why his legendary scar which happens to be the famous result of a death curse gone wrong is aching in pain, and perhaps even causing mysterious visions. It is the fourth installment in the Harry Potter film series, written by Steve Kloves and produced by David Heyman. The film stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, alongside Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Harry's best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger respectively. The story follows Harry Potter's fourth year at Hogwarts as he is chosen by the Goblet of Fire to compete in the Triwizard Tournament, a highly dangerous competition. Before he can think too much about it, however, Harry boards the train to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he will attend his fourth year of magical education. Shortly after his reunion with his best friends, Ron and Hermione, Harry is introduced to yet another Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher: the grizzled Mad-Eye Moody, a former dark wizard catcher who agreed to take on the infamous 'DADA' professorship as a personal favor to Headmaster Dumbledore. Of course, Harry's wishes for an uneventful school year are almost immediately shattered when he is unexpectedly chosen, along with fellow student Cedric Diggory, as Hogwarts' representative in the Tri-Wizard Tournament, which awards whoever completes three magical tasks the most skillfully with a thousand-galleon purse and the admiration of the international wizard community. As difficult as it is to deal with his schoolwork, friendships, and the tournament at the same time,Harry doesn't realize that the most feared wizard in the world, Lord Voldemort, is anticipating the tournament, as well.The main characters are maturing, and the filmmakers are likewise improving on their craft; vibrant special effects and assured performances add up to what is the most complex yet of the Harry Potter films.Mike Newell handily takes the directing reins and eases his young cast through awkward growth spurts into true young actors.Added to that,the special effects are first rate but I think it's always going to be about the characters. And there are a lot of great characters in this movie as it is a more mature story and its young stars prove they have the acting skills to grow with their characters.Like a fine wine, Harry Potter continues to improve with age as each succeeding film version of Rowling's books seemingly surpasses the last.",10,1,2,22 October 2012
Castle in the Sky," Miyazaki's Greatest Film
","Inspired by 'Gulliver's Travels,' the fantasy-adventure Castle in the Sky was Hayao Miyazaki's third feature, and helped to establish his reputation as a visionary in both Japan and the United States.The film is about a young boy and a girl with a magic crystal must race against pirates and foreign agents in a search for a legendary floating castle.As for the elements of the film,it echoes in Myazaki's earlier Nausicaä, and anticipates imagery in his later films, from My Neighbor Totoro to Spirited Away. The English dub, which features Anna Paquin, James Van Der Beek and Cloris Leachman,is lively and close in tone to the original Japanese, if a bit talkier.Aside from that,the exciting flying sequences, appealing characters, and fantastic vision of a steam- powered future Jules Verne might have imagined make Castle in the Sky a must-have for fans of Japanese and Western animation.The viewer will obviously have an uplifting experience as it's the perfect place to view where Miyazaki has been and where he intends to go.Overall,it is the greatest film he has ever made.",10,2,2,24 October 2012

The Godfather: Part III," The Godfather Part III: The Greatest Underrated Film Ever Made
","Many have trashed the third part of The Godfather.Many fans of the first two movies have called it that the movie should have not been made.Some have said that this movie does not hold a candle to the first two movies as Parts I and II are considered American masterpieces as both have established a standard for cinema excellence.While others have coldly stated,'This movie is simply an offer you can refuse'.LOL Anyway,The Godfather Part III stars Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, and Andy García, and it features Eli Wallach, Joe Mantegna, George Hamilton, Bridget Fonda, and Sofia Coppola.It is about an aging Don Michael Corleone,who seeks to legitimize his crime family's interests and remove himself from the violent underworld. Unfortunately,he is kept back by the ambitions of the young namely Joey Zaza and hungrier gangsters. While he attempts to link the Corleone's finances with the Vatican, Michael must deal with the machinations of a hungrier gangster in both Don Licio Lucchesi and Don Altobello,who are seeking to upset the existing mob order.Aside from that,it also involves Vincent Mancini,a young protégé of Michael who gets involved with a love affair with his daughter,Mary.The movie also weaves into its plot a fictionalized account of real-life events—the 1978 death of Pope John Paul I and the Papal banking scandal of 1981–1982—and links them with each other.Director Francis Ford Copolla said the first two films had told the complete Corleone saga. In his audio commentary for Part II, he stated that only a dire financial situation caused by the failure of New York Stories compelled him to take up Paramount's long-standing offer to make a third installment.Coppola and Mario Puzo,author of The Godfather, requested six months to complete a first draft of the script with a release date of Easter 1991. Paramount agreed to give them six weeks for the script and, lacking a holiday movie, a release date of Christmas Day 1990. Given the conditions together with the casting of neophyte actress and the director's daughter,Sofia Copolla,whom many fans have vehemently criticized for her poor portrayal of Mary Corleone,I still believe that Part III is still a great film. Part III still has great acting from the cast except from Sofia Copolla,whom I must really say deserved the Razzies he got from this film.Worthy of mention is of course,Al Pacino,Andy Garcia and Eli Wallach.Also,the movie's story still works despite missing Robert Duvall and his character,Tom Hagen,whom I believe was really essential in story as he plays an important role in the family. The screenplay was also good BUT one cannot fully comprehend this movie without watching the first two.And of course,other great features from the previous Godfather movies are still present in this movie like the great writing of Copolla and Puzo,the music of Carmine Copolla and Nino Rota and the direction of Copolla.Overall,it is still a great movie although not a masterpiece as compared to the first two.After viewing The Godfather Part III once again after so many years before writing this review,I would say that if The Godfather is the greatest film ever made and The Godfather Part II is the greatest sequel ever made,this movie is definitely the greatest underrated film ever made.It is a great movie although it may not be comparable to the first two in terms of critical and commercial success.The Academy Award nominations it got attest to that.",10,11,20,19 October 2011
The Matrix Reloaded," A Sequel Not As Good As The Original
","The Matrix Reloaded is a science fiction action and the second installment in The Matrix trilogy, written and directed by Larry and Andy Wachowski. It features Keanu Reeves,Laurence Fishburne and Carrie- Anne Moss together with Hugo Weaving,Harold Perrineau,Randall Duk Kim and Jada Pinkett Smith.In the sequel,Neo, Trinity and Morpheus continue to lead the revolt against the Machine Army. In their quest to save the human race from extinction, they gain greater insight into the construct of The Matrix and Neo's pivotal role in the fate of mankind.Neo and Trinity have been summoned by Morpheus to join him on a voyage to Zion, the last outpost of free human beings on Earth. Neo and Trinity's work together has been complicated by the fact the two are involved in a serious romantic relationship. Upon their arrival in Zion, Morpheus locks horns with rival Commander Lock and encounters his old flame Niobe. Meanwhile, Agent Smith has returned with some surprises for Neo, most notably the ability to replicate himself as many times as he pleases. Neo makes his way to The Oracle, who informs him that if he wishes to save humankind, he must unlock 'The Source,' which means having to release The Key Maker from the clutches of Merovingian. While Merovingian refuses to cooperate, his wife, Persephone, angry at her husband's dalliances with other women, offers to help, but only in exchange for a taste of Neo's affections. With The Keymaker in tow, Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus are chased by Merovingian's henchmen: a pair of deadly albino twins.Though introducing some new ideas and characters, Matrix Reloaded is not as exciting as the first and original film,The Matrix. It suffers from problems that often inflict middle chapters of trilogies and most sequels as this film only soars to places only hinted at in the original.But nevertheless,the film can be commended for the action sequences,intelligence and character development despite the fact that it does not hold a candle to its predecessor.",9,1,2,28 October 2012

Jimmy also gets his relatives, the Savage brothers, to conduct an investigation of their own. Jimmy and Sean both start to suspect their old pal, Dave Boyle, who lives a quiet life with his wife Celeste but harbors some disturbing secrets.The entire cast did a phenomenal job, resisting the urge to overact too much, which is what you get for a film like this.Anchored by the exceptional acting of its strong cast particularly Sean Penn and Tim Robbins, this is a somber drama that unfolds in layers and conveys the tragedy of its story with visceral power.It works as a straight-up detective story and plot is far from being perfect.But nevertheless,the performances makes up for all its flaws.",10,1,2,30 September 2012
It's a Wonderful Life," It's A Wonderful Film!!!
","It's a Wonderful Life is a Christmas drama film produced and directed by Frank Capra, that was based on the short story 'The Greatest Gift', written by Philip Van Doren Stern.The film stars James Stewart as George Bailey, a man whose imminent suicide on Christmas Eve brings about the intervention of his guardian angel, Clarence Odbody. Clarence shows George all the lives he has touched and how different life in his community would be had he never been born.As the film opens, it's Christmas Eve, 1946, and George, who has long considered himself a failure, faces financial ruin and arrest and is seriously contemplating suicide. High above Bedford Falls, two celestial voices discuss Bailey's dilemma and decide to send down eternally bumbling angel Clarence Oddbody, who after 200 years has yet to earn his wings, to help George out. But first, Clarence is given a crash course on George's life, and the multitude of selfless acts he has performed: rescuing his younger brother from drowning, losing the hearing in his left ear in the process; enduring a beating rather than allow a grieving druggist to deliver poison by mistake to an ailing child; foregoing college and a long-planned trip to Europe to keep the Bailey Building and Loan from letting its Depression-era customers down; and, most important, preventing town despot Potter (Lionel Barrymore) from taking over Bedford Mills and reducing its inhabitants to penury. Along the way, George has married his childhood sweetheart Mary, who has stuck by him through thick and thin. But even the love of Mary and his children are insufficient when George, faced with an $8000 shortage in his books, becomes a likely candidate for prison thanks to the vengeful Potter. Bitterly, George declares that he wishes that he had never been born, and Clarence, hoping to teach George a lesson, shows him how different life would have been had he in fact never been born. After a nightmarish odyssey through a George Bailey-less Bedford Falls (now a glorified slum called Potterville), wherein none of his friends or family recognize him, George is made to realize how many lives he has touched, and helped, through his existence; and, just as Clarence had planned, George awakens to the fact that, despite all its deprivations, he has truly had a wonderful life. What is remarkable about It's a Wonderful Life is how well it holds up over the years; it's one of those ageless movies, like Casablanca or The Third Man, that improves with age.It is due to the fact that it combines the characters, the story, the message, and the acting in one cohesive and flawless film.That is why it's easy to see why it isn't just a holiday favorite, but a great movie by almost any standards through out the decades.It is truly the epiphany of movie sentiment and a transcendent experience.In summary,this holiday classic to define all holiday classics, It's a Wonderful Life is one of a handful of films worth an annual viewing.It's truly a wonderful film!!!!",10,2,4,27 February 2012
Enemy at the Gates," A Powerful Film About Human Understanding Of Inhuman Conflict
","Enemy at the Gates is a war film starring Joseph Fiennes, Jude Law, Rachel Weisz, Bob Hoskins and Ed Harris.The story is set during the Battle of Stalingrad in World War II.The film's title is taken from William Craig's 1973 nonfiction book Enemy at the Gates: The Battle for Stalingrad, which describes the events surrounding the Battle of Stalingrad from 1942–1943.The film is based on a duel mentioned in the book that developed between Soviet sniper Vasily Zaitsev,a marksman from the Urals who is transported to Stalingrad in 1942, and a master German sniper, Major Koenig, an expert German sniper who is determined to eliminate his formidable opponent by any means necessary.Meanwhile, Vasily has joined forces with Danilov, a young Russian political adversary, who is impressed by his skills and raises his profile in the Soviet Union. Both become involved with Tanya, whose Jewish parents have been captured by the Germans and have forced her to take up with the men on a sniper expedition.Then Koenig and Vassily begin to develop traps for each other, until fate inevitably must bring the two sharpshooters together.It generally succeeds at telling a truly heroic story, providing yet another vehicle to showcase the talents of Law and Harris, and of their supporting cast.Atmospheric and thrilling, it gets the look and feel of war right. However, the love story seems out of place as it the love triangle happens to be a poor subplot in this war film.But nevertheless,its theme of human understanding of an inhuman conflict that gives it so much power despite its flaws and defects.",9,1,2,9 October 2012

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Honors The Legacy Of Harry Potter
","The next installment in the Harry Potter series finds young wizard Harry Potter and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger facing new challenges during their second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as they try to uncover a dark force that is terrorizing the school in this movie entitled,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.This fantasy film is based on the novel of the same title by J. K. Rowling. The film stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, alongside Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Harry's best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. It is the second installment in the Harry Potter film series, written by Steve Kloves and directed by Chris Columbus. The story follows Harry Potter's second year at Hogwarts as the Heir of Salazar Slytherin opens the Chamber of Secrets, unleashing a deadly monster that petrifies the school's pupils.Harry Potter and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger return for a second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where Headmaster Dumbledore, Professor Snape, Professor McGonagall, and Hagrid the Giant are joined by new faculty members Gilderoy Lockhart, a self- centered expert in Defense against the Dark Arts, and Sprout,who teaches Herbology. However, it isn't long before Harry and company discover something is amiss at Hogwarts: Students are petrified like statues, threats are written in blood on the walls, and a deadly monster is on the loose. It seems that someone has opened the mysterious Chamber of Secrets, letting loose the monster and all its calamitous powers. As Harry, Ron, and Hermione set out to find the secret chamber and slay the beast, speculation is rife that one of the heirs of Salazar Slytherin, the co-founder of the school, opened the chamber as a warning against the presence of 'mudbloods' at the school and that the culprit may be fellow student Draco Malfoy.First sequels are the true test of an enduring movie franchise, and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets passes with flying colors. Expanding upon the lavish sets, special effects, and grand adventure of this Harry Potter film involves a darker, more malevolent tale beginning with the petrified bodies of several Hogwarts students and magical clues leading Harry and his friends to a 50-year-old mystery in the monster-laden Chamber of Secrets.Darker and livelier than the first Harry Potter, but much of what's wrong with the first movie is also present here.Added to that,house elves, squealing mandrakes, giant spiders, and venomous serpents populate this loyal adaptation and Kenneth Branagh delightfully tops the supreme supporting cast as the vainglorious charlatan Gilderoy Lockhart. At 161 minutes, the film suffers from lack of depth and uneven pacing, and John Williams' score mostly reprises established themes. The young, fast-growing cast offers ample compensation and so does the supporting cast. Brimming with cleverness, wonderment, and big-budget splendor, Chamber honors the legacy of J.K. Rowling's novels.",10,1,3,22 October 2012

However, when John and Jane are both assigned to take out the same target, one Benjamin Danz, they become aware of each other's secret lives, and suddenly both their careers and their marriage go through some dramatic and potentially deadly changes.The newly-rekindled Smith partnership is quickly threatened by their employers, who have now decided to eliminate the couple.

Fending off an attack which blows up their house, the Smiths steal their neighbor's minivan and successfully destroy three pursuing armored vans of attackers, all while bickering over their fighting styles and newly-discovered personal secrets. After meeting with Eddie, the Smiths decide to fight together to preserve their marriage. They kidnap Danz from his high-security prison in order to give their employers something they want more than the Smiths. Danz reveals that he was merely bait, hired jointly by their employers after it was discovered that the Smiths were married, in the hopes of having one Smith kill the other.John and Jane forgo their separate contingency plans and make their stand together.The pretty on screen union of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie is the only thing Mr. & Mrs. Smith offers an audience beyond a relentlessly repetitive series of gunfights and car chases wherein so many bullets are fired that you feel like you're witnessing an average film.The chemistry generated by on screen movie stars are palpable enough to make this a thoroughly enjoyable and satisfying despite of weak writing and one too many explosions and action scenes.Also,this was one controversial film as Pitt and Jolie started to develop their off-screen romance.",8,1,3,5 January 2012

The film is directed by Martin Scorsese.It has a star- studded cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone, Vera Farmiga, and Alec Baldwin.The story begins when Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is introduced to organized crime through Irish mobster Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) in the Irish neighborhood of South Boston at a young age. Costello trains him to become his mole inside the Massachusetts State Police. Sullivan is accepted into the Special Investigations Unit, which focuses on organized crime.While Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is asked by Captain Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Staff Sergeant Sean Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) to become an Undercover Agent due to the fact that his family ties to organized crime that makes him a perfect infiltrator. Before he graduates,he drops out of the Academy and does time in prison on a fake assault charge to increase his credibility.Eventually,both infiltrate their respective organizations and play a cat-and-mouse game until the end of the film.We are treated to a great action thriller in The Departed.But comparing Infernal Affairs and The Departed,the original is a lot superior as compared to the American remake.Infernal Affairs is more realistic and has more emotional depth as compared to The Departed.It clearly explores the complexities and moral ambiguity that both Inspector Lau and Yan are undergoing.Aside from that,the material is very original and it is truly brilliantly made.The acting of the film is also great especially that of Andy Lau and Tony Leung.There are more interesting characters like Inspector Wong and Sam,the triad boss.Finally,the movie's ending makes you feel for both Inspector Lau,who finally became the person that he wants to assume by becoming a real cop through a series of lies and murder; and Yan,whom we feel considering that he never got his true identity back of being a cop and will always be remembered as a criminal.The Departed is just a two-hour and a half mindless entertainment.It is NOT AN ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY since it is remake of Infernal Affairs. (Literally it is a remake since it copied scene by scene of the Infernal Affairs - LOL).Most of the great scenes of the movie was taken from IA as well.Also,there is too much swearing in the film.Why do the movie has to have the word f*ck said for 237 times?Do all cops and criminals swear every time they speak?Also,both Billy Costigan and Colin Sullivan are one-dimensional.One is good and the other is bad.There are too many characters and a lot of them are bland.Frank Costello looks more like a cartoon-like character rather than a mafia boss.There is less emotional depth and complexities as compared to the original.Then there is the pathetic character of Vera Farmiga named Madolyn.Does she really have to sleep with both Colin and Billy?We are treated to the acting histrionics of the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio,Mark Wahlberg and Jack Nicholson.Matt Damon is simply bland in this film.Watch Damon in The Informant instead.Finally,the viewer has less empathy to the characters in the end since everybody just has to get shot in the end.In the end,I still prefer the original compared to this remake although this movie still deserves a 10/10 rating.",10,3,4,8 October 2011
Glory Road," An Inspiring Sports Movie
","Glory Road is a sports film directed by James Gartner, based on a true story dealing with the events leading to the 1966 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship, in which the late Don Haskins – played by Josh Lucas – head coach of the Texas Western College led a team with an all- black starting lineup, a first in NCAA history.The film also stars Jon Voight as the legendary coach Adolph Rupp together with Derek Luke, Alphonso McAuley, Mehcad Brooks, Al Shearer, Damaine Radcliff, Sam Jones III, and Schin S. Kerr.Don Haskins was a high school and college basketball star who, after six years of working with high school teams, became the head coach at Texas Western University in 1962. At that time, Texas Western's basketball program was not well respected, but Haskins was determined to change that, and in 1966 Haskins assembled what he was certain was a winning team. However, Haskins' starting lineup was comprised entirely of African-American athletes at a time when racially integrated teams were still a novelty in the South and West. Despite generating a firestorm of controversy, Haskins and his players showed they could succeed where it counted -- on the court. In post-season play Haskins and the Texas Western team found themselves competing for the NCAA championship against the University of Kentucky's all-white team, lead by legendary coach Adolph Rupp.The movie is a rousing and worthy tribute to one of the most important college basketball teams and one of the most important championship games of all time.Also,it is a David and Goliath sports saga that holds just as much suspense and interest no matter how many times you watch it.Obviously,it is an inspiring sports movie.",9,1,1,10 September 2012
Die Hard," Great pace,Great Gun Battles,Great Fun
","Die Hard is an action film directed by John McTiernan and written by Steve de Souza and Jeb Stuart based on the 1979 novel Nothing Lasts Forever by Roderick Thorp.The film follows NYPD officer John McClane,played by Bruce Willis, as he takes on a group of highly organized criminals led by Hans Gruber performing a heist under the guise of a terrorist attack, using hostages including McClane's wife Holly to keep the police at bay.It's Christmas time in L.A., and there's an employee party in progress on the 30th floor of the Nakatomi Corporation building. The revelry comes to a violent end when the party goers are taken hostage by a group of terrorists headed by Hans Gruber, who plan to steal the 600 million dollars locked in Nakatomi's high-tech safe. In truth, Gruber and his henchmen are only pretending to be politically motivated to throw the authorities off track; also in truth, Gruber has no intention of allowing anyone to get out of the building alive. Meanwhile, New York cop John McClane has come to L.A. to visit his estranged wife, Holly, who happens to be one of the hostages. Disregarding the orders of the authorities surrounding the building, McClane, who fears nothing (except heights), takes on the villains, armed with one handgun and plenty of chutzpah. The scenes move with such relentless energy and smashing special-effects extravagance that Die Hard turns out to be everything action-genre fans, and Bruce Willis's relieved investors, might have hoped for.Apart from that,it is characterized as great pace, great gun battles, great fun.For this reason alone,Die Hard delivers.",9,1,2,8 March 2012
Psycho," A Horror Classic
","Psycho is a suspense/horror film directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh. The screenplay by Joseph Stefano is based on the 1959 novel of the same name by Robert Bloch. The novel was loosely inspired by the crimes of Wisconsin murderer and grave robber Ed Gein,who lived just 40 miles from Bloch.In the 60's,Hitchcock was already famous as the screen's master of suspense when he released Psycho and forever changed the shape and tone of the screen thriller. From its first scene, in which an unmarried couple balances pleasure and guilt in a lunchtime liaison in a cheap hotel, Psycho announced that it was taking the audience to places it had never been before, and on that score what followed would hardly disappoint. The film depicts the encounter between a secretary, Marion Crane,hiding at a secluded motel after embezzling money from her employer, and the motel's disturbed owner and manager, Norman Bates, and the aftermath of their encounter.Marion is unhappy in her job at a Phoenix, Arizona real estate office and frustrated in her romance with hardware store manager Sam Loomis. One afternoon, she is given $40,000 in cash to be deposited in the bank. Minutes later, impulse has taken over and Marion takes off with the cash, hoping to leave Phoenix for good and start a new life with her purloined nest egg. 36 hours later, paranoia and exhaustion have started to set in, and Marion decides to stop for the night at the Bates Motel, where nervous but personable innkeeper Norman Bates cheerfully mentions that she's the first guest in weeks, before he regales her with curious stories about his mother. There's hardly a film fan alive who doesn't know what happens next, but while the shower scene is justifiably the film's most famous sequence, there are dozens of memorable bits throughout this film.Obviously,it remains a horror classic as it was filmed with tact, grace, and art as well as blends a brutal manipulation of audience identification and an incredibly dense, allusive visual style to create the most morally unsettling film ever made.",10,1,1,27 February 2012
American Made," Does Tom Cruise Makes A Comeback?
","After the last two movies made by Tom Cruise that somehow placed my own doubts on his mega stardom - 'Jack Reacher:Never Go Back' and 'The Mummy' - with the former being far less of a money earner - earning only $162 million as compared to the $500+ million that his Mission:Impossible movies make - and the latter being trashed by critics considering it as an unsuccessful and messy reboot of 'The Mummy' franchise,the question is:Did he make a successful comeback in 'American Made'?Before going to the review proper, let us discuss what 'American Made' is all about.It is a film written by Gary Spinelli and directed by Doug Liman.It stars Cruise together with Domhnall Gleeson, Sarah Wright, Alejandro Edda, Mauricio Mejía, Caleb Landry Jones and Jesse Plemons.The story or screenplay focuses on Barry Seal,who happens to be a former TWA pilot that became a drug smuggler for the Medellin Cartel during the 1980's.In order to avoid getting into prison,Seal decided to cooperate and be an informant for the DEA - Drug Enhancement Board - when he was approached by the U.S. government.The movie only earned $30 million in the United States and $100 million worldwide despite having a budget of $50 million with Tom Cruise commanding at least $20 million in salary.No question that it did not earn much being a Tom Cruise movie considering his Mission:Impossible movies can earn as much as $500+ million globally.With regards to his performance,no question that Tom Cruise did better as compared to his Jack Reacher and The Mummy films but I personally found him somewhat of a miscast considering that he has to have somehow a Louisiana-devil-may-care attitude and present himself as the youthful Seals on his 20's despite being 55 years of age.I felt that despite the energy he brought to the character,he wasn't able to provide a good characterization being a limited actor that can only provide life to arrogant and charismatic characters like Maverick in 'Top Gun'. While many critics considered it a good film,it could have been a masterpiece and a big earner like 'The Godfather' had it been under more talented people particularly a more capable director and a versatile lead actor instead of Doug Liman and Tom Cruise respectively.So to answer the question 'Does Tom Cruise make a comeback?',I would say no he doesn't.His cold streak from 'Jack Reacher:Never Go Back', 'The Mummy' and 'American Made' continues.No question that the presence of Tom Cruise at 55 years-old is no longer enough for his movies to be successful.He definitely has to be in the right role and the right material to continue his success as a Hollywood megastar.",5,5,9,14 October 2017
Rosemary's Baby," Rosemary's Baby Holds Up To The Present
","In Roman Polanski's first American film that is adapted from Ira Levin's horror bestseller, a young wife comes to believe that her offspring is not of this world.The film,entitled Rosemar's Baby,features Mia Farrow, John Cassavetes, Ruth Gordon, Maurice Evans, Sidney Blackmer and Charles Grodin.Farrow plays a pregnant woman who fears that her husband may have made a pact with their eccentric neighbors, believing he may have promised them the child to be used as a human sacrifice in their occult rituals in exchange for success in his acting career.Rosemary Woodhouse and her struggling actor husband, Guy move into the Bramford, an old New York City apartment building with an ominous reputation and only elderly residents. Neighbors Roman and Minnie Castevet soon come nosing around to welcome the Woodhouses to the building; despite Rosemary's reservations about their eccentricity and the weird noises that she keeps hearing, Guy starts spending time with the Castevets. Shortly after Guy lands a plum Broadway role, Minnie starts showing up with homemade chocolate mousse for Rosemary. When Rosemary becomes pregnant after a mousse-provoked nightmare of being raped by a beast, the Castevets take a special interest in her welfare. As the sickened Rosemary becomes increasingly isolated, she begins to suspect that the Castevets' circle is not what it seems. The diabolical truth is revealed only after Rosemary gives birth, and the baby is taken away from her. This is a frightening tale of Satanism and pregnancy that is even more disturbing than it sounds thanks to convincing and committed performances by Mia Farrow and Ruth Gordon.In addition to that,Polanski's camera-work and Richard Sylbert's production design transform the realistic setting into a sinister projection of Rosemary's fears, chillingly locating supernatural horror in the familiar by leaving the most grotesque frights to the viewer's imagination. Having escaped the horrors of the Nazi Holocaust in Poland by the skin of his teeth, Mr. Polanski was well equipped psychologically to re- imagine what was, before Rosemary's Baby, a B-picture genre into an A- picture genre.And four decades later,his supremely mounted horror thriller holds up extremely well.",10,1,2,26 October 2012
Jersey Boys," It Has Its Musical Moments
","This film by Clint Eastwood is a theatrical version of the stage musical Jersey Boys which narrates the story of the rock iconic group Four Seasons during their early days back in the 1960's. Many songs from the group are featured such as 'Can't Take My Eyes Off You','Sherry','Big Girls Don't Cry','Walk Like a Man','My Eyes Adored You' and many others.The screenplay written by Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice tells the story of four young men from New Jersey who are growing up on the wrong side decide to form a singing group that later become an legendary band that released many classic songs.The film definitely has its musical moments especially when the classic songs are being played on screen.But the positive things about it ends right here as the film is somehow not energetic and interesting as the story of the group is being told.In the end,the music somehow overshadows everything in the movie from the comedic scenes,the characters and the acting.",8,1,1,6 July 2015

The Holiday," A Lovable Romantic Comedy
","The Holiday is a romantic comedy film written, produced and directed by Nancy Meyers. It stars Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet as two lovelorn women from opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean, who temporarily exchange homes to escape heartbreak during the holiday season. Jude Law and Jack Black co-star, with Eli Wallach, Shannyn Sossamon, Edward Burns and Rufus Sewell playing key supporting roles.After each suffers her fair share of romantic disappointments, Englishwoman Iris and L.A. woman Amanda meet on-line at a website devoted to helping people exchange houses for vacations. Each agrees to spend the Christmas holiday at the other's home. While each suffers from a minor case of culture shock, both women also end up becoming involved with a man. Iris makes the acquaintance of an upbeat every man played by Jack Black, while Amanda spends time with a handsome Brit played by Jude Law. Both women must decide what to do with these new relationships as their pre-arranged house switch is scheduled to last less than two weeks.The film lacks any surprises and eventually overstays its welcome while sweet and somewhat touching.The characters pace and putter around in the story like animals building their nests, and by the time they finally settle down with their mates, we have a grudging affection for them.Also,the writing is clever enough and the performances warm and engaging enough to make this a far better-than-average.",8,1,3,27 September 2012
Zero Dark Thirty," The Film About The Pursuit Of Osama Bin Laden
","Zero Dark Thirty is a dramatization of the United States operation that found and killed Osama bin Laden, leader of al-Qaeda. It stars Jessica Chastain, Jason Clarke, Joel Edgerton, Chris Pratt, Jennifer Ehle, Mark Strong, Kyle Chandler, and Édgar Ramírez. It was directed by Katherine Bigelow.Maya, a young CIA officer in 2003, has spent her entire brief career since graduating from high school focused solely on gathering intelligence related to Osama bin Laden, leader of al-Qaeda, following the terrorist organization's September 11 attacks in the United States. She has just been reassigned to the U.S. embassy in Pakistan to work with a fellow officer, Dan. During the first months of her assignment, Maya often accompanies Dan to a black site for his continuing interrogation of Ammar al-Baluchi, a detainee with suspected links to several of the 9/11 hijackers. Dan subjects the detainee to torture, including water boarding, and humiliation. He and Maya eventually trick Ammar into divulging that an old acquaintance, who is using the alias Abu Ahmed, is working as a personal courier for bin Laden. Other detainees corroborate this, with some claiming Abu Ahmed delivers messages between bin Laden and a man referred to as Abu Faraj. Maya continues to sift through masses of data and information, using a variety of technology, hunches and sharing insights. Displaying the zeal and frustrations of a 'single-tasker', she concentrates on finding Abu Ahmed, determined to use him to find bin Laden. During a span of five years, she survives the 2008 Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing as well as being shot at in her car by armed men. Dan, departing on re-assignment, warns Maya about a possible change in politics, suggesting that the new administration may prosecute those officers who had been involved in torture. Maya's fellow officer and friend Jessica is killed in the 2009 Camp Chapman attack. A Jordanian detainee claims the man previously identified, as Abu Ahmed, from a photograph, is a man he personally buried in 2001. Several CIA officers – Maya's seniors – conclude the target who could be Abu Ahmed is long dead, and that they have searched a false trail for nine years.Meanwhile, the President's National Security Adviser tasks the CIA with producing a plan to capture or kill bin Laden if it can be confirmed that he is in the compound. An agency team devises a plan to use two top-secret stealth helicopters flown by the Army's 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment to secretly enter Pakistan and insert a U.S. Navy SEAL team to raid the compound. Before briefing the President of the United States, the CIA Director holds a meeting of his top officials, who assess only a 60–80% chance that bin Laden is living in the compound, rather than another high-value target. Maya, also in attendance, insists the chances are 95–100%.The raid is approved. Although execution is complicated by one of the helicopters crashing, the SEALs kill a number of people within the compound, among them a man on the compound's top floor who is revealed to be bin Laden. They bring bin Laden's body back to a U.S. base in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, where Maya visually confirms the identity of the corpse. Gripping, suspenseful, and brilliantly crafted, Zero Dark Thirty dramatizes the hunt for Osama bin Laden with intelligence and an eye for detail. From the very first scenes, director Kathryn Bigelow demonstrates why she is such a formidable filmmaker, as adept with human emotion as with visceral, pulse-quickening action. She tells the story very well, very efficiently, but doesn't really say much about it, which is ironic given the response to the film in some quarters. It is just awful that Bigelow robbed of an Oscar nomination.We know the ending as most are familiar with the story,yet remain mesmerized by familiar details, filmed with a harrowing sense of urgency. It's as close to being in the White House situation room that night, watching a closed-circuit broadcast, as anyone could expect.It surely should have been given the Academy Award for Best Picture.Acting was also commendable especially Jessica Chastain,who played the hyper-focused Maya with intensity and passion.I definitely believed that she should have won the Oscar instead of Jennifer Lawrence.Obviously, the film wasn't free from controversy considering that it presents graphic torture scenes used by US military men in extracting information from terrorists.It has also been described by some as a misleading portrayal of torture as critical to the United States' success in gaining information on bin Laden's associates and location. In addition, some politicians suggested that the filmmakers were given improper access to classified materials, which they denied.It is viewed by some as propaganda for torture. This could have probably dismayed some people from Washington especially those who formulated the NDAA (National Defense Authorization Act) which supports 'enhanced interrogation techniques' such as the use of torture and indefinite detention.Also,the final scene as Maya is last seen boarding a military transport to return to the U.S. and sitting in its vast interior as its only passenger as she begins to weep quietly.This have given the audience the impression of the on-going bin Laden conspiracies that the terrorist is probably still alive or he is long dead before the raid was conducted. Knowing Hollywood, it definitely feared from giving those one great film too much acclaim as due to its theme being political in nature such not giving it the Best Picture for this film was definitely better than Argo,the Bigelow snub and the Chastain robbery.But nevertheless, it film that should not be missed especially by lovers of great movies.",10,2,8,25 March 2013
Steve Jobs," Steve Jobs At Different Times Of His Life
","After watching the lackluster Ashton Kutcher film 'Jobs' two years ago,my earnest hope was that there is will be a better film released sometime in the future.With director David Boyle,screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and a cast led by Michael Fassbender working together on a film based on the Walter Isaacson's authorized biography on the late Apple CEO,will 'Steve Jobs' be answer?The film consists of something similar to a three-act play wherein we get to see the life of Steve Jobs during the unveiling of a new product at three different times of his life.The first act consists of having Jobs working for Apple as a member of an Macintosh R and D group and whose company is about to release the new computer called Macintosh in 1984.The second act consists of having Jobs,who was fired from Apple, now working in his new company called NeXT Computers,which is about to unveil the new computer called 'Cube' in 1988.The final act consists of Jobs now again back at Apple working as the CEO and whose company is to release a new computer called iMac in 1998.In these three parts of the film,we get to witness Jobs in three different times of his life from being an company founder of the flourishing Apple Computer Company during the release of the Macintosh in 1984;a fired Apple employee who just started a new lackluster NeXT company during the release of the Cube in 1988; and finally a leader of a resurging Apple company during the release of the iMac in 1998.At the center of these events is Jobs and how he has found success early in his life;get humbled after getting fired from his company by the board and start a new company that had limited success; and get hired back to his company and help it get back from state of being close to bankruptcy into becoming the most successful company in the world.At the center of it all is his relationship with his daughter Lisa whom he first refused to acknowledge when he had early success in life;later reconnected with her during the humbling moments of his life; and finally formed a father-and-daughter relationship when he found a renewed success when he got back to his former company.As for fans and haters alike of the late Apple CEO,Fassbender provides us a marvelous portrayal of a Steve Jobs being both an innovator and a monster alike.We get to witness him as someone that is extremely difficult to get along with due to being an extremely arrogant egomaniac but at the same time whose thinking and ideas for innovation and marketing has led the computer industry into greater heights.Apparently,Steve Wozniak,who acted as consultant to the film,will definitely be more satisfied as it presents a horrible Steve Jobs and it provides appreciation to the engineers and technicians who worked behind the scenes for the release of the successful products of Apple.The film consists of lots of dialogues between characters that is why listening essential to fully appreciate it.In fact,I would not be surprised if 'Steve Jobs' will become a theatrical play someday.Finally,going back to my question: Was this a better biopic compared to the one released two years ago? Absolutely!!!!!",9,64,133,15 September 2015

All Quiet on the Western Front," A Powerful Movie On The Horrors Of War
","One of the most powerful anti-war statements ever put on film,All Quiet on the Western Front is a gut-wrenching story concerns a group of friends who join the Army during World War I and are assigned to the Western Front, where their fiery patriotism is quickly turned to horror and misery by the harsh realities of combat.It features Louis Wolheim,Lew Ayres,John Wray, Raymond Griffith and George 'Slim' Summerville. It is the definitive World War I motion picture, the best of a surprisingly small class of movies. Director Lewis Milestone pioneered the use of the sweeping crane shot to capture a ghastly battlefield panorama of death and mud, and the cast is terrific as Lew Ayres would never again equal his performance in this film version of the well-known anti-war novel. It is of timeless relevance and effects.The rawness of the audio eradicates any lingering notion that war is romantic or exciting, and at times suggests the very battered eardrums of those engaged in combat.This classic remains one of the most powerful screen comments on the horrors of war.",10,5,5,27 October 2012

There Will Be Blood," A Great Movie About Oil
","Writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson steps outside his contemporary world of dysfunctional Angelenos to explore a very different dysfunctional man that happens to be an oil pioneer whose trailblazing spirit is equaled only by his murderous ambition.The movie entitled,There Will Be Blood is Anderson's loose adaptation of the novel Oil! by Upton Sinclair that features Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano together with Dillon Freasier,Kevin J. O'Connor and Ciarán Hinds.The screenplay focuses its attentions on Daniel Plainview, a miner who happens upon black gold during a disastrous excavation that ends in a broken leg.Pulling himself up from the bowels of the earth, both literally and metaphorically, Plainview embarks on a systematic and steadfast approach to mastering the oil business. Using plain-spoken and straightforward language, Plainview launches a campaign to convince small-town property owners they should let him drill their land. Without him, they won't have the equipment to access the profit beneath their feet. He builds an empire this way and gradually becomes obsessed with the intrinsic value of power, growing increasingly irascible and paranoid in the process. Plainview meets his match in Eli Sunday, a teenage preacher in the small California town of Little Boston, whose brother tipped Plainview off to the town's plentiful supply of untapped oil. To fully reap the benefits of the land, Plainview must suffer the opposing whims of this 'prophet,' whose legitimacy is questionable at best. And it's unclear if either man is prepared to pay the humiliating price the other wants to exact.A sprawling epic of family, faith, power and oil, this film is set on the incendiary frontier of California's turn-of-the-century petroleum boom.Also,it establishes itself as a film of Darwinian ferocity, a stark and pitiless parable of American capitalism.Anderson has truly made an old fashioned, great movie. Not to be missed!!!",10,3,5,19 October 2012
To Kill a Mockingbird," A Depression-era Film On Race,Prejudice And Justice
","To Kill a Mockingbird is a drama film adaptation of Harper Lee's novel of the same name directed by Robert Mulligan. It stars Mary Badham in the role of Scout and Gregory Peck in the role of Atticus Finch and marks the film debuts of Robert Duvall, William Windom, and Alice Ghostley.Set a small Alabama town in the 1930s, the story focuses on scrupulously honest, highly respected lawyer Atticus Finch, magnificently embodied by Gregory Peck. Finch puts his career on the line when he agrees to represent Tom Robinson, a black man accused of rape. The trial and the events surrounding it are seen through the eyes of Finch's six-year-old daughter Scout. While Robinson's trial gives the film its momentum, there are plenty of anecdotal occurrences before and after the court date: Scout's ever-strengthening bond with older brother Jem, her friendship with precocious young Dill Harris (a character based on Lee's childhood chum Truman Capote and played by John Megna), her father's no- nonsense reactions to such life-and-death crises as a rampaging mad dog, and especially Scout's reactions to, and relationship with, Boo Radley, the reclusive 'village idiot' who turns out to be her salvation when she is attacked by a venomous bigot. To Kill a Mockingbird is a time capsule, preserving hopes and sentiments from a kinder, gentler, more naive America.But I consider that a minor shortcomings in a rewarding film.Since its release, this intelligent, atmospheric film has been warmly received by audiences responding not only to their own childhood, but also to the heroic image portrayed by Peck, a shining example of citizenship and affectionate fatherhood.Furthermore,Gregory Peck delivers an Oscar-winning performance as a righteous lawyer in one of the best American films of the 1960s, a Depression-era chronicle of race, prejudice, and justice-- and coming of age.",10,1,3,2 March 2012
The Bridge on the River Kwai," A War Film About Individuals
","The Bridge on the River Kwai is a British World War II film by David Lean based on The Bridge over the River Kwai by French writer Pierre Boulle. The film is a work of fiction but borrows the construction of the Burma Railway in 1942–43 for its historical setting. It stars William Holden, Jack Hawkins, Alec Guinness and Sessue Hayakawa. The film was shot in Sri Lanka (credited as Ceylon, as it was known at the time). The bridge in the movie was located near Kitulgala.The Bridge on the River Kwai opens in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp in Burma in 1943, where a battle of wills rages between camp commander Colonel Saito and newly arrived British colonel Nicholson. Saito insists that Nicholson order his men to build a bridge over the river Kwai, which will be used to transport Japanese munitions. Nicholson refuses, despite all the various 'persuasive' devices at Saito's disposal. Finally, Nicholson agrees, not so much to cooperate with his captor as to provide a morale-boosting project for the military engineers under his command. The colonel will prove that, by building a better bridge than Saito's men could build, the British soldier is a superior being even when under the thumb of the enemy. As the bridge goes up, Nicholson becomes obsessed with completing it to perfection, eventually losing sight of the fact that it will benefit the Japanese. Meanwhile, American POW Shears, having escaped from the camp, agrees to save himself from a court martial by leading a group of British soldiers back to the camp to destroy Nicholson's bridge. Upon his return, Shears realizes that Nicholson's mania to complete his project has driven him mad. Brilliant is the word, and no other, to describe the quality of skills that have gone into the making of this picture.Most war movies are either for or against their wars. The Bridge on the River Kwai is one of the few that focuses not on larger rights and wrongs but on individuals for it speaks of the code of honor amongst men during war, the respect shared by enemies of war, and the madness which war evokes.In short,this complex war epic asks hard questions, resists easy answers, and boasts career-defining work from star Alec Guinness and director David Lean.",10,4,6,7 March 2012
A Hard Day's Night," Dated But Still A Great Musical Movie
","A Hard Day's Night is a British black-and-white comedy film directed by Richard Lester that features the The Beatles — John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr — at the height of Beatlemania. It was written by Alun Owen. The film was made in the style of a mockumentary, describing a couple of days in the lives of the group.Using a variety of techniques cribbed from Hollywood slapstick comedies, the French 'new wave' movement, and his own experiences as a TV- commercial director, Lester fashioned an exhilarating study of a 'typical' 36 hours in the lives of the Fab Four. Onto a plot about getting to the Big Show on time are hung a series of instant-reaction gags, character vignettes, and musical setpieces. Much of the humor arises from Paul McCartney's efforts to keep his grandfather, a 'clean old man,' from getting into mischief. Also good for several laughs is the hookey-playing Ringo Starr, whose mistimed declaration of independence lands him in jail. We are also treated to a war of nerves between the unflappable John Lennon and an uptight TV director, who worries that, should the Beatles not show up at broadcast time, he'll be demoted to 'News In Welsh.' George Harrison stars in a sequence in which he is mistaken for an auditionee by the producer of a superficially trendy, teen-oriented TV weekly. Then there's Norman Rossington and John Junkin as The Beatles' managers, who carry on a battle royale simply because one man is taller than the other. The supporting cast includes comedienne Anna Quayle, cartoonist Bob Godfrey, TV host Robin Ray, dancer Lionel Blair, Harrison's future wife Patti Boyd, and director Lester himself. The songs include 'I Should Have Known Better,' 'And I Love Her,' 'Tell Me Why,' 'If I Fell,' 'Can't Buy Me Love,' and the title song,'A Hard Day's Night'.This humorous mockumentary of the Beatles had a huge impact, forever changing the definition and limits of the musical movie genre for it captures the Beatles when they still looked like they were having fun, back before drugs and psychedelia and Yoko Ono took effect.The result still seems fresh and different decades later.",10,1,1,15 September 2012
Man on Fire," Denzel Washington Delivers But The Movie Doesn't
","Man on Fire is an action thriller that is based on A. J. Quinnell's 1980 novel of the same title.It stars Denzel Washington as John Creasy, a despondent former CIA operative/Force Recon Marine officer turned bodyguard, who goes on a revenge rampage after his charge, nine-year-old Pita Ramos is abducted in Mexico. Among the supporting cast includes Christopher Walken, Giancarlo Giannini and Mickey Rourke.This adaptation was directed by Tony Scott, from a screenplay written by Brian Helgeland.John Creasy, a burned-out former CIA operative and assassin, is slowly killing himself with the bottle. Still, when another fellow retired spook recruits him for a bodyguard job, he reluctantly accepts. A Mexican industrialist, Samuel Ramos and his wife Lisa are parents of Creasy's 9-year-old charge, Pita.When Creasy arrives on the scene, people are in a panic in Mexico City, where 24 abductions have occurred in just one six-day period, 70 percent of them resulting in the murder of the victim.Ramos is going through a financial crisis, and can't afford regular bodyguards. So he hires Creasy at a discount, because despite his impressive resume, it's clear that the man is a drunk. The first part is all about redemption. In it,we see Creasy is the typical world-weary cynic who wants no complications in life. He just wants to do his job and be left alone.Then slowly, bit by bit, he's won over by the sparkly, bright-eyed optimism of his charming young charge as their friendship starts. One has probably seen this type of movie before especially made by child stars.The second is extremely violent and it's all about revenge. It all becomes tedious after a while because you know the little girl is going to be kidnapped, you just don't know when. Now the film turns into a violent action film as revenge becomes the central character. Creasy nearly dies during the kidnapping, but when he recovers he hooks up with a Mexico City newspaper reporter and a former head of Interpol, who give him the inside information he needs to track down the organized gang behind the kidnappings.Basically what they're doing is helping a vigilante who can kill at will and not have to worry about the niceties of Mexican law.This part is characterized by flashy camera moves and the style and pace that director Tony Scott is known for in his movies like Spy Game,Enemy Of The State and Top Gun as he pull out all the stops using multiple hand-held cameras, different film stocks, slash edits, and even a hand-cranked camera at times to slow down or speed up the movement.It's also got all the Scott touches as he fills the screen with lots of blood 'n' guts action accompanied by gigantic explosions which are all wonderfully photographed.Obviously,Denzel Washington delivers in terms of quality acting as we are absorbed by his character and we are left to believe that the relationship he slowly develops with the young Mexico City girl he's hired to protect. But then the strong opening levels out into a long series of action scenes, and the double-reverse ending works more like a gimmick than a resolution. In summary,both parts stand up well on their own, but a person who wants to see one kind of movie may not like the other feeling Man Of Fire is two different movies that is suited for two types of audiences.",9,2,3,4 August 2013
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," A Cinema Classic
","With an insane asylum standing in for everyday society, Milos Forman's 1975 film adaptation of Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a comically sharp indictment of the Establishment urge to conform. It features Jack Nicholson,Louise Fletcher,William Redfield,Brad Dourif,Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd.The film was the second to win all five major Academy Awards (Best Picture, Actor in Lead Role, Actress in Lead Role, Director, and Screenplay) following It Happened One Night in 1934, an accomplishment not repeated until 1991 by The Silence of the Lambs.Playing crazy to avoid prison work detail, manic free spirit Randle P. McMurphy is sent to the state mental hospital for evaluation. There he encounters a motley crew of mostly voluntary inmates, including cowed mama's boy Billy and silent Native American Chief Bromden, presided over by the icy Nurse Ratched. Ratched and McMurphy recognize that each is the other's worst enemy: an authority figure who equates sanity with correct behavior, and a misfit who is charismatic enough to dismantle the system simply by living as he pleases. McMurphy proceeds to instigate group insurrections large and small, ranging from a restorative basketball game to an unfettered afternoon boat trip and a tragic after-hours party with hookers and booze. Nurse Ratched, however, has the machinery of power on her side to ensure that McMurphy will not defeat her. Still, McMurphy's message to live free or die is ultimately not lost on one inmate, revealing that escape is still possible even from the most oppressive conditions.Viewed more than 30 years after its release, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest remains a very good motion picture compared to present movies.Jack Nicholson stars in an outstanding characterization of Ken Kesey's asylum anti-hero, McMurphy, and Milos Forman's direction of a superbly-cast film is equally meritorious and a cinema masterpiece.The on screen battle between Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher serves as a personal microcosm of the culture wars of the 1970s -- and testament to the director's vision that the film retains its power more than three decades later.What makes it memorable after so many years is that it remains a marvel of contemporary filmmaking due to its intelligence, entertainment value, and themes such as pondering on life, manhood, and how society can be much scarier than nurses in white coats.A classic indeed.",10,2,4,11 January 2012
Edge of Tomorrow," This Only Proves That Tom Cruise Can Carry A Film To Box Office Hit Like No Other
","After being in the business for more than thirty years,many Tom Cruise haters have been frustrated and tried to bring him down particularly his comments on Scientology.But in the end,he always prevail.Just like in his new film Edge Of Tomorrow which became both a critical and commercial success.Edge of Tomorrow stars Cruise and Emily Blunt together with Bill Paxton and Brendan Gleeson.It was adapted from the Japanese novel All You Need Is Kill by Hiroshi Sakurazaka.Doug Liman was the director.This is a science fiction film follows a setting sometime in the future.

Downfall," Hitler's Last Ten Days
","Downfall is an epic war film depicting the final ten days of Adolf Hitler's life in his Berlin bunker and Nazi Germany in 1945.It stars Bruno Ganz as Adolph Hitler and Alexandra Maria Lara as Traudl Junge, together with Corinna Harfouch,Ulrich Matthes,Juliane Köhler and Thomas Kretschmann.The film was written by Bernd Eichinger, and based upon the books Inside Hitler's Bunker, by historian Joachim Fest; Until the Final Hour, the memoirs of Traudl Junge, one of Hitler's secretaries (co- written with Melissa Müller); Albert Speer's memoirs, Inside the Third Reich; Hitler's Last Days: An Eye–Witness Account, by Gerhardt Boldt; Das Notlazarett Unter Der Reichskanzlei: Ein Arzt Erlebt Hitlers Ende in Berlin by Doctor Ernst-Günther Schenck; and Siegfried Knappe's memoirs, Soldat: Reflections of a German Soldier, 1936–1949.It was directed by directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel.Traudl Junge was twenty-two years old when, in the fall of 1942, she was hired to be personal secretary to Adolf Hitler. In April of 1945, Junge was still working for Hitler as forces were bearing down on Germany and the leader retreated to a secret bunker in Berlin for what would prove to be the last ten days of his life, as well as that of the Third Reich. As Hitler's mistress Eva Braun attempts to throw a cheerful birthday party for her man, Hitler's closest associates, including Heinrich Himmler, Joseph Goebbels, and Albert Speer, urge him to flee the city with only Goebbels maintaining any illusions that the Third Reich has any hope of survival. Hitler refuses to leave Berlin, and he spends his final days ranting and raving to Junge, blaming all around him as he tries to understand where his leadership went wrong. Meanwhile, Goebbels and his wife round up their six children and bring them to the bunker as Berlin begins to topple, determined to take their lives rather than face the Allies after Germany's certain defeat.The greatest achievement of this film is that it gives a definitive and unbiased account of Hitler's final days and the collapse of the Third Reich.The film also had excellent and outstanding performance especially from Bruno Ganz,who plays the German dictator as delusional, hateful and cruel man -- but also human.Arguably,this film presents the greatest portrayal of the man who also has emotions and is affected by his demons as a human being.It also shows him in times of trials,tribulations and impending defeat.Although some may see Ganz' portrayal as a neo-Nazi in one way or another,the film only tries to show the humanity of the person who just like you and me have their own strengths and weaknesses.Aside from the focus on Hitler,this film's message also tells us how men who uses evil devices end up on the final run.It is a lesson that a viewer can see not from a historical point-of-view but rather on one's own perspective as a human being.No matter how one rises in power,one should also foresee that it doesn't last forever as there is a time that everything ends.In Hitler's case,his downfall also came inspite the fact that he was capable of conquering the world and turn it under his authority.",10,1,2,4 December 2011

In the following months, Lucas solidifies his status as Harlem's most innovative drug dealer by delivering a product that is purer than the competitors' and cheaper, as well. When innovative businessman Lukas attempts to go semi-legit by becoming one of the Manhattan borough's biggest civil supporters, however, street- savvy outcast cop Ritchie Roberts begins to sense a sizable shift in the hierarchy of the drug underworld. But Roberts is one of the few honest detectives operating within a corrupt system, and as he sets out to investigate the case, crooked detective Trupo does everything in his power to compromise the integrity of his idealistic counterpart. Upon clearing all of the usual Mafia-connected suspects, Roberts begins to believe that a previously unknown black power player has come out of the woodwork to dominate the local drug trade. While Roberts and Lucas may be operating on opposite sides of the law, the one thing that both men have in common is a strict code of ethics that separates them from their opportunistic colleagues. Now, as a confrontation between the two men becomes inevitable and the fate of each becomes inexorably tied to the other, it gradually becomes apparent that only one of them will emerge from the conflict victorious.American Gangster an epic, true crime drama, that although not entirely original in its premise is excellent in its execution.It maybe long at 157 minutes but immerses its audience with its twists and intricacies as it plays out and considers the logistics and consequences of crime and police corruption, with a plethora of show-stealing performances from the cast especially Washington's steely grip on his impersonation of Frank Lucas.",10,14,16,18 September 2012
The Mission," The Mission Is A Brilliant And Excellent Film
","The Mission is a drama about the experiences of a Jesuit missionary in 18th century South America.It stars Robert De Niro and Jeremy Irons together with Ray McAnally, Aidan Quinn, Cherie Lunghi and Liam Neeson. It was written by Robert Bolt and directed by Roland Joffé. The film examines the events surrounding the Treaty of Madrid in 1750, when Spain ceded part of South America to Portugal, and turns this episode into an allegory for struggles of Latin America. Two European forces are on hand to win the South American natives over to imperialist ways. The plunderers want to extract riches and slaves from the New World. The missionaries, on the other hand, want to convert the Indians to Christianity and win over their souls. Mendoza is an exploiter dabbling in the slave trade. But after he kills his brother Felipe in a fit of rage, he seeks redemption and calls upon the missionaries to assist him. After repeatedly climbing a cliff with a heavy weight as penance, Mendoza finds redemption and becomes a devout missionary at a settlement run by Gabriel. The missionaries want to promote a new society in which the natives will live together in peace with the Spanish and the Portuguese. But this concept frightens the royal governors, who would rather enslave the natives than encourage peaceful coexistence between the Europeans and the Indians. They order the mission to be burned to the ground. But this event causes a rift between Gabriel, who wants to pray and pursue peaceful resistance, and Mendoza, who wants to take up arms and fight the Europeans.Featuring a majestic score by Ennio Morricone and lush Oscar-winning cinematography by Chris Menges,the Mission is shot through with piercing, haunting imagery, pictures of enduring imaginative force.Also,it is a rich and thought-provoking. It contains moving images of despair, penance, and redemption that are among the most evocative ever filmed.The performances are also great especially that of De Niro,who effective as a callous soldier who kills his own brother and then turns to a missionary to oversee his penance and conversion to the clergy. The narrative and dramatic forces at work in this movie should be more stirring and powerful than they are but unfortunately,it lacks doesn't as it is too detached for the viewer to feel concern with the events and characters in the story.But that doesn't take that much from it as it remains a brilliant and excellent film.",10,11,12,28 September 2012
The Green Mile," Another Superb Darabont Prison Film
","Director Frank Darabont, who made an acclaimed feature film debut with The Shawshank Redemption, based on a Stephen King novel set in a prison, returns for a second feature, based on King's 1996 serialized novel set in a prison in The Green Mile.It was adapted by him from the 1996 Stephen King novel of the same title. The story is told in a flashback format and tells the story of Paul Edgecomb with John Coffey,and his life as a death row corrections officer during the Great Depression in the United States, and the supernatural events he witnessed.The movie stars Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan as Edgecomb and Coffey respectively,and David Morse,Bonnie Hunt and James Cromwell together Michael Jeter, Sam Rockwell, and Graham Greene.In 1935, inmates at the Cold Mountain Correctional Facility call Death Row 'The Green Mile' because of the dark green linoleum that tiles the floor. Paul Edgecomb is the head guard on the Green Mile when a new inmate is brought into his custody: John Coffey,convicted of the sadistic murder of two young girls. Despite his size and the fearsome crimes for which he's serving time, Coffey seems to be a kind and well- mannered person who behaves more like an innocent child than a hardened criminal. Soon Edgecomb and two of his fellow guards, Howell, notice something odd about Coffey: he's able to perform what seem to be miracles of healing among his fellow inmates, leading them to wonder just what sort of person he could be, and if he could have committed the crimes with which he was charged.It was a long film that was a shade under three hours.But that does not mean that it was boring.In fact,it was absorbing and compelling as we get sympathetic to the lead character particularly John Coffey.Also,despite the clichés and stereotypes that characterized this film,the performances of the cast manages to lift it from the depths of the commonplace and make watching it enjoyable.Credit should be given no only to Tom Hanks but also to Michael Clarke Duncan for his honest and sincere portrayal of Coffee,which definitely touches the audience heart and empathy.Also,Darabont once again pleases the viewer with his superb direction just like in The Shawshank Redemption.",10,1,2,28 December 2011
The Reader," Kate Winslet At Her Finest
","The Reader is a film based on the 1995 German novel of the same name by Bernhard Schlink.It stars Kate Winslet,at her finest role to date, together with Ralph Fiennes and Michael Kross.It was written by David Hare and directed by Stephen Daldry.The movie serves as the last film for producers Anthony Minghella and Sydney Pollack, who both died before it was released.The story is a haunting period drama concerning the relationship between a 15-year-old German boy and a mysterious woman twice his age, and the way that it grows doubly complex when the man re-encounters the woman years later and discovers a shocking truth about her past. The film opens on the character of Michael Berg in middle age -- cold, remote, and emotionally withdrawn.Then it moves back in time to 1950s Berlin, where ailing teenager Michael has fallen ill with fever, and is discovered in the street by Hanna, a woman in her thirties. After Michael recovers, the two immediately lapse into a torrid affair and Michael falls prey to the confusion of his own burgeoning sexuality. Their liaisons are often marked by Hanna's request that Michael read to her. Later, when Michael returns to Hanna's flat and finds it deserted, her absence becomes an emotional blow for which he is completely unprepared, and indeed, scarred for life. The film then moves forward in time by eight years. Michael,who is now a law student,walks into a courtroom and comes across Hanna,one of a series of Nazi prison guards being tried for murderous war crimes during World War II. As he watches her on the witness stand, memories of their past experiences together bring him to the point of realization concerning a startling, long-buried truth about Hanna and Michael knows that if he divulges this information, it could modify the prison sentence handed out and dramatically alter her fate. The performances of the actors were highly commendable.Kate Winslet's portrayal of the illiterate and complex Hanna was just beyond description.It was definitely the finest performance of her career.Winning the Oscar Best Actress award was definitely well- deserved.The other actors/actresses were also great as well.As for the story,it was a holocaust movie with a deep,twisting dive into a dense tangle of thorny moral,ethical,situational and emotional issues.Aside from that,it also touches on underage desire that converges with perverse passions. Overall,it is one excellent and outstanding movie.",10,1,1,29 October 2011
Jaws," Jaws Sets The Benchmark For Sea Thrillers
","Based on Peter Benchley's best-selling novel, Steven Spielberg's shark saga set the standard for the New Hollywood popcorn blockbuster while frightening millions of moviegoers out of the water in this movie,Jaws. It stars Roy Scheider as police chief Martin Brody, Richard Dreyfuss as oceanographer Matt Hooper, Robert Shaw as shark hunter Quint, Murray Hamilton as the mayor of Amity Island, and Lorraine Gary as Brody's wife, Ellen.The screenplay was written by Benchley and Carl Gottlieb; and it was directed by Spielberg.One early summer night on fictional Atlantic resort Amity Island, Chrissie decides to take a moonlight skinny dip while her friends party on the beach. Yanked suddenly below the ocean surface, she never returns. When pieces of her wash ashore, Police Chief Brody suspects the worst, but Mayor Vaughn, mindful of the lucrative tourist trade and the approaching July 4th holiday, refuses to put the island on a business- killing shark alert. After the shark dines on a few more victims, the Mayor orders the local fishermen to catch the culprit. Satisfied with the shark they find, the greedy Mayor reopens the beaches, despite the warning from visiting ichthyologist Hooper that the attacks were probably caused by a far more formidable Great White. One more fatality later, Brody and Hooper join forces with flinty old salt Quint, the only local fisherman willing to take on a Great White. The three ride off on Quint's boat 'The Orca,' soon coming face to teeth with the enemy.Compelling, well-crafted storytelling and a judicious sense of terror ensure Steven Spielberg's Jaws has remained a benchmark in the art of delivering modern blockbuster thrills.Aside from that,credit should also be given to the outstanding performances of the cast particularly by Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss. Featuring an unforgettable score that evokes pure terror, Jaws remains one of the most influential and gripping adventures in motion picture history as it has remained a cultural phenomenon and forever changing the movie industry.When it comes to this kind of thriller, no movie has been able to top Jaws, although many have tried. And, as the years go by, it seems increasingly unlikely that anything will come close.",10,1,3,30 September 2012
The Wrestler," A Wonderful Performance By Mickey Rourke
","His sense of identity fading into nothingness after the spotlights dim and he experiences a close brush with mortality, a retired wrestler begins to evaluate his life while considering the comeback that could very well kill him in director Darren Aronofsky's poignant portrait of an introspective former superstar in the twilight of his career in this movie entitled,The Wrestler.It was written by Robert D. Siegel and it features Mickey Rourke in the title role together with Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood.Back in his heyday, wrestler Randy 'The Ram' Robinson was an icon in the ring. His image immortalized in action figures and video games, he would headline arenas across the globe. Twenty years later, those glory days have passed, and Randy is forced to earn his keep by brawling before handfuls of fans in high school gyms and community centers around New Jersey. In the wake of a heart attack, the former icon attempts to earn a little extra cash while working in a deli and making an effort to reconnect with his estranged teenage daughter, Stephanie. Yet, despite Randy's continued attempts at convincing local stripper Cassidy to settle down with him in his humble trailer, the ring still calls to him. Later, when the prospect of a high-profile rematch with his longtime nemesis presents itself, Randy is forced to weigh his mortality against his desire to hear the crowd roar one last time. It's a wonderful, career-reviving performance, and you can't imagine the movie without Mickey Rourke.Added to that,the movie presses too hard and too often, but the performances are strong enough to withstand the melodramatic impulses, and the themes of isolation and self- destructiveness are too sharply realized to be trivialized.And with with uncommon intelligence and brutal honesty, it examines the cost, and need, of battle which makes it a richly affecting, heart-wrenching yet ultimately rewarding drama.",10,1,2,20 October 2012

It is the sixth and final film released in the Star Wars saga and the third in terms of the series' internal chronology.The film takes place three years after the onset of the Clone Wars. The Jedi Knights are spread out across the galaxy leading a massive clone army in the war against the Separatists.After a fierce battle in which Obi-Wan and Anakin join Republic forces to help free Chancellor Palpatine from the evil Count Dooku and his minions, Anakin is drawn into Palpatine's confidence. Palpatine has designs on expanding his rule, and with this in mind he plants seeds of doubt in Anakin's mind about the strength and wisdom of the Jedis. Anakin is already in a quandary about how to reveal to others the news of his secret marriage to Padmé Amidala now that she is pregnant, and visions which foretell her death in childbirth weigh heavy on his mind. As Anakin finds himself used by both the Jedis and the Republic for their own purposes -- particularly after Mace Windu expresses his distrust of the young Jedi - - he turns more and more to the Force for help, but begins to succumb to the temptations of its dark side. The Jedi Council dispatches Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi to eliminate the evil General Grievous, leader of the Separatist Army. Meanwhile, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, separated from Kenobi, his former master, grows close to Palpatine, the Chancellor of the Galactic Republic and, unbeknown to the public, a Sith Lord. Their deepening friendship proves dangerous for the Jedi Order, the galaxy, and Anakin himself, who inevitably succumbs to the Dark Side of the Force and becomes Darth Vader.A grave and vigorous popular entertainment, a picture that regains and sustains that Lucas had dreamed up a long time ago, in a movie industry that seems far, far away.They did really save the best for last.Many of the Star Wars series regulars returned for Revenge of the Sith, including Frank Oz as the voice of Yoda, Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, Kenny Baker as R2-D2, and Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca.Sith succeeds in providing a satisfying ending to the films as Anakin Skywalker begins his journey to the Dark Side.It was the best-looking Star Wars episode of all, if not the most exciting, most imaginative or most affecting.In summary,this sixth and final installment of George Lucas' epic space opera will please die-hard fanatics and non-believers alike -- largely due to awesome digital effects and the sheer power of the mythology wherein a relatively thoughtful story about a young man meant for greatness but corrupted by his own fear and confusion is told.",10,3,5,14 January 2012
Ray," This Biopic Immortalizes Ray Charles
","Ray is a biographical film focusing on life of musician Ray Charles. It starred Jamie Foxx in the title role together with Kerry Washington, Clifton Powell,Harry Lennix,Terrence Howard,Larenz Tate,Richard Schiff and Regina King.It was directed by Taylor Hackford.Despite humble beginnings and the loss of his eyesight due to glaucoma at the age of six, Ray Charles would nonetheless become an icon in both the music industry and the civil rights era. While this biopic delves into his problems with drugs and women, the bulk of the story details his career. Among the highlights of that career are 12 Grammy awards and 11 R&B chart-toppers, such as 'Unchain My Heart','Hit the Road, Jack','Georgia,' 'Doin' the Mess Around' and 'Hallelujah I Just Love Her So'.Also,it provides a portrait of him as a musical genius as he overcomes heroin addiction while transforming into one of his country's most beloved performers As he revolutionized the way people appreciated music, he simultaneously fought segregation in the very clubs that launched him and championed artists' rights within the corporate music business. When watching this film,the viewer can't stop loving Jamie Foxx's performance in Ray.His uncannily accurate performance isn't the only good thing about it. He also proved himself worthy of all the hype by portraying blind R&B legend.Despite a few dramatic embellishments of actual incidents,the biopic does a remarkable job of summarizing Charles's strengths as a musical innovator and his weaknesses as a philandering heroin addict who recorded some of his best songs while flying high as a kite. When watching it,the viewer will notice that it was an engrossing and energetic take on the musical icon's achievements and demons but it nevertheless immortalizes him just like how Ritchie Valens was in La Bamba as director Taylor Hackford gets most of the period details absolutely right as he chronicles Ray's rise from performer in the early '50s to his much-deserved elevation to legendary status as one of the all-time great musicians.",10,1,2,30 September 2012

WALL·E," One For The Ages
","WALL-E is a computer-animated post-apocalyptic science fiction film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and directed by Andrew Stanton. The story follows a robot named WALL-E, who is designed to clean up a waste- covered Earth far in the future. He falls in love with another robot named EVE, who also has a programmed task, and follows her into outer space on an adventure that changes the destiny of both his kind and humanity. Both robots exhibit an appearance of free will and emotions similar to humans, which develop further as the film progresses.After directing Finding Nemo, Stanton felt Pixar had created believable simulations of underwater physics and was willing to direct a film largely set in space. Most of the characters do not have actual human voices, but instead communicate with body language and robotic sounds, designed by Ben Burtt, that resemble voices. In addition, it is the first animated feature by Pixar to have segments featuring live-action characters.This computer-animated tale is about a wide-eyed robot who travels to the deepest reaches of outer space in search of a newfound friend. The year is 2700, and planet Earth has long been uninhabitable. For hundreds of years, WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) has been taking out the trash, and collecting precious knick-knacks in order to stave off the boredom of his dreary routine. Little does WALL-E realize that he has recently stumbled onto a secret that could save planet Earth, and once again make the ravaged planet safe for all humankind. When highly advanced search robot EVE makes friends with WALL-E and realizes the value of his remarkable discovery, she excitedly races back to let the humans know that there's hope for their home planet after all. But after centuries alone in space, WALL-E can't stand the thought of losing the only friend he's ever known, and eagerly follows her into the deepest reaches of space on the adventure of a lifetime. Along the way, the friendly trash-collecting robot who has always known what he was made for gradually begins to understand what he was meant for.Charming, audacious, and timely, Wall-E's lighthearted magic and stellar visuals testify once again to Pixar's ingenuity.It is a story about love and loneliness, perseverance and triumph, the possibilities and pitfalls of human existence. That this story is told by way of the exploits of a tiny, faceless robot only makes it more extraordinary.It is one for the ages, a masterpiece to be savored before or after the end of the world - - assuming, like the title character, you're still around when all the humans have taken off and have access to an old video player.",10,1,2,1 March 2012
The Good Shepherd," The Birth Of The C.I.A
","The Good Shepherd is a spy film directed by Robert De Niro.It has an ensemble cast Matt Damon and Angelina Jolie, with an extensive supporting cast namely: William Hurt,Alec Baldwin,Billy Crudup,Michael Gambon,Timothy Hutton,Joe Pesci,John Turturro and Robert De Niro himself. Although it is a fictional film loosely based on real events, it is advertised as telling the untold story of the birth of counter- intelligence in the Central Intelligence Agency. The film's main character, Edward Wilson is loosely based on James Jesus Angleton and Richard M. Bissell.In 1939, Edward Wilson is a young man with a bright future ahead of him -- he's a top student at Yale and the protégé of one of the school's leading English professors, Dr. Fredericks. But Wilson's life changes dramatically when he's invited to join Yale's powerful secret society, Skull and Bones. Through his Skull and Bones connections, Wilson meets Sam Murach, an mysterious FBI agent who asks Wilson to investigate charges that Fredericks is a Nazi sympathizer working with the German government. Later, at a Skull and Bones party, Wilson is introduced to Clover Russell, the sister of one of his classmates and the daughter of a powerful politician; their one-night stand leaves Clover pregnant, and Wilson must leave the woman he loves, Laura , to wed Clover and give their child a name. Shortly after their wedding, thanks to his work with Murach, Wilson is invited to join the Office of Strategic Services, a military intelligence organization organized by Bill Sullivan, and Wilson accepts. Through World War II, Wilson serves with the OSS, and learns he can trust no one in the game of international espionage, which helps make him little more than a stranger to his wife, his son, and his few friends. As the OSS evolves into the Central Intelligence Agency after the war, Wilson becomes party to America's darkest and most dangerous secrets, and in the wake of the futile Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, Wilson is forced to make a terrible choice between the security of his nation and the safety of his family.The Good Shepherd is a remarkable study of the corrosive effects of fear and power on an establishment insider who puts duty above all else.This is a cool-headed thriller and a richly detailed character study that traces the birth and evolution of America's foreign espionage bureaucracy.Also,despite of being ambiguous and astonishingly thorough tragedy, it shows that emotions as human as any errors can undermine intelligence and questions whether God and country alone can be enough for a man's soul.",10,1,2,20 September 2012
Stalag 17," A Black Comedy War Film
","Stalag 17 is a war film which tells the story of a group of American airmen held in a German World War II prisoner of war camp, who come to suspect that one of their number is a traitor. It was adapted from a Broadway play.Produced and directed by Billy Wilder, it features William Holden, Don Taylor, Robert Strauss, Neville Brand, Harvey Lembeck, and Peter Graves. Wilder also cast Otto Preminger in the role of the camp's Commandant.It was adapted by Wilder and Edwin Blum from the Broadway play by Donald Bevan and Edmund Trzcinski who were both prisoners in Stalag 17B in Austria.Stalag 17, exclusively populated by American sergeants, is overseen by sadistic commandant Oberst Von Schernbach and the deceptively avuncular sergeant Schultz. The inmates spend their waking hours circumventing the boredom of prison life; at night, they attempt to arrange escapes. When two of the escapees, Johnson and Manfredi, are shot down like dogs by the Nazi guards, Stalag 17's resident wiseguy Sefton callously collects the bets he'd placed concerning the fugitives' success. No doubt about it: there's a security leak in the barracks, and everybody suspects the enterprising Sefton, who manages to obtain all the creature comforts he wants of being a Nazi infiltrator. Things get particularly dicey when Lt. Dunbar, temporarily billeted in Stalag 17 before being transferred to an officer's camp, tells his new bunkmates that he was responsible for the destruction of a German ammunition train. Sure enough, this information is leaked to the Commandant, and Dunbar is subjected to a brutal interrogation. Certain by now that Sefton is the 'mole', the other inmates beat him to a pulp. But Sefton soon learns who the real spy is, and reveals that information on the night of Dunbar's planned escape.The movie survives the jump from stage to screen with flying colors, thanks to Billy Wilder's typically sterling direction and a darkly funny script.The good greatly outweighs the bad, particularly in the profile of Holden's character, a pragmatic, self-centered cynic whose heroism, when it is finally called upon, appears to come from deep within the barriers he has placed inside of himself.Despite the seriousness of the situation,it is as much comedy as wartime melodrama, with most of the laughs provided by Robert Straussand Harvey Lembeck. Other standouts in the all-male cast include Richard Erdman, Neville Brand, Peter Graves, Gil Stratton and Robinson Stone.It is a bleak, black comedy in which the laughter can die in the throat.",10,2,3,26 October 2012
The Terminal," Entertaining And Mesmerizing
","Shot almost entirely on a two-and-a-half-story recreation of a full-size operating airport terminal, this romantic comedy entitled,The Terminal from director Steven Spielberg revolves around Viktor Navorski.The Terminal is a comedy-drama film that stars Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones together with Stanley Tucci,Barry Shabaka Henley,Kumar Pallana and Diego Luna. It is about a man trapped in a terminal at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport when he is denied entry into the United States and at the same time cannot return to his native country, the fictitious Krakozhia, due to a revolution. It is partially inspired by the 18-year-stay of Mehran Karimi Nasseri in the Charles de Gaulle International Airport, Terminal I, Paris, France from 1988 to 2006.An Eastern European man by the name of Viktor Navorski,whose plans of immigrating to New York were hastened by a violent coup in his home country. Unfortunately, Viktor finds himself on the wrong end of a nasty technicality while en route to America: His passport was issued from a country, which, during its upheaval, ceased to exist in an official capacity. Unauthorized to leave Kennedy Airport upon his arrival and unable to return home, Viktor finds himself exiled inside the terminal's international transit lounge. Though airport official Frank Dixon views Viktor as an annoying bureaucratic glitch, other airport employees -- including a beautiful flight attendant by the name of Amelia -- come to see him as a welcome, if unofficial, addition to their numbers. As the days stretch on into months, the terminal transforms from an intimidating atmosphere of forced assimilation into a country within itself, complete with culture, ambition, status, complex diversity, and the need for love.This is an amazing film for the story threads that play out enjoyably, and other threads end up going nowhere as it was played completely in one location: the airport terminal. Enjoy the film from scene to scene, since there are definite pleasures along the way. I commend Hanks for his brilliant portrayal of Victor Navorski for he was excellent in keeping the viewers interest and sympathy towards him from the beginning to the end of the film.Also,I applaud Spielberg for delving into some new territory that was never explored in other films in the past. Although some may not be satisfied with Spielberg's direction,I still find this movie truly entertaining and mesmerizing.",10,1,3,28 December 2011

The Shawshank Redemption," A Classic Film On Hope And Redemption
","This is probably one of the best films of all time.IMDb ranks this best film of all time.It can arguably be the best film of all time considering that its message of hope and inspiration to everyone.It is a short story from Stephen King.The Shawshank Redemption is a poignant story of Andy Dufresne,a wrongly convicted killer who was sent for two life sentences to Shawshank Prison in Maine.It tells us on how Andy lived inside the walls of the Shawshank,being raped from time to time by convicted homosexuals felons,his friendship with Red,having a sense of hope despite of his seemly hopeless situation,making the most of his life by using his accounting skills by helping the guards in their income tax and cleaning the warden's dirty money and to finally escaping from prison through a hole in the wall hidden under poster of women such as Rita Hayworth and Rachel Welsh.Great acting especially by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.Direction was superb by first time director Frank Darabont.The musical score was also good.I view this film from time to time to remind myself that there is hope in all situations even those I consider hopeless ones.It also a story of letting go of hatred and letting love flow into your heart despite of being around despicable characters.Aside from that,this film is neither contrived nor manipulative as it is full of surprises.It will truly be enjoyed by anybody who love great films and those who wants films that can truly uplift the human spirit.In the end,this movie will be talked about for the next 20 to 50 or more years to come.Personally it my favorite film of more than a thousand films I seen in my life for it is a classic film on hope and redemption.",10,4,5,23 April 2006

Platoon," Another View Of War
","Oliver Stone wrote the story based upon his experiences as a U.S. infantryman in Vietnam to counter the vision of the war portrayed in John Wayne's The Green Berets entitled,Platoon.It stars Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe and Charlie Sheen together with Forest Whitaker,Francesco Quinn,John C. McGinley,Richard Edson and Kevin Dillon.It is war film written and directed by Stone,which is the first of his Vietnam War trilogy, followed by Born on the Fourth of July; and Heaven & Earth.Platoon is a brutally realistic look at a young soldier's tour of duty in Vietnam. Chris Taylor is a college student who quits school to volunteer for the Army in the late '60s. He's shipped off to Vietnam, where he serves with a culturally diverse group of fellow soldiers under two men who lead the platoon: Sgt. Barnes, whose facial scars are a mirror of the violence and corruption of his soul, and Sgt. Elias, who maintains a Zen-like calm in the jungle and fights with both personal and moral courage even though he no longer believes in the war. After a few weeks, Taylor begins to see the naïveté of his views of the war, especially after a quick search for enemy troops devolves into a round of murder and rape. This movie excels in the sense that it is a grunt's-eye view of the war, touching on moral issues but focusing on the men who fought the battles and suffered the wounds. It resembles older war movies more than its Vietnam peers, as it mixes familiar elements of on screen battle with small realistic details: bugs, jungle rot, exhaustion, C-rations, marijuana, and counting the days before you go home together with a contemporary sensibility and the psychological effects it has brought to the soldiers involved.Also,the cast involved were brilliant in their performance.It is a masterpiece, once seen, will never be forgotten, and, at least for those who were not in Vietnam, will forever alter the way in which the war is considered.",10,2,3,21 December 2011
Paths of Glory," Power
","Paths of Glory is an anti-war film by Stanley Kubrick based on the novel of the same name by Humphrey Cobb.Set during World War I, the film stars Kirk Douglas as Colonel Dax, the commanding officer of French soldiers who refused to continue a suicidal attack. Dax attempts to defend them against a charge of cowardice in a court-martial.Adapting Humphrey Cobb's novel to the screen, Kubrick and his collaborators Calder Willingham and Jim Thompson set out to make a devastating anti-war statement, and they succeeded above and beyond the call of duty. In the third year of World War I, the erudite but morally bankrupt French general Broulard orders his troops to seize the heavily fortified 'Ant Hill' from the Germans. General Mireau knows that this action will be suicidal, but he will sacrifice his men to enhance his own reputation. Against his better judgment, Colonel Dax leads the charge, and the results are appalling. When, after witnessing the slaughter of their comrades, a handful of the French troops refuse to leave the trenches, Mireau very nearly orders the artillery to fire on his own men. Still smarting from the defeat, Mireau cannot admit to himself that the attack was a bad idea from the outset: he convinces himself that loss of Ant Hill was due to the cowardice of his men. Mireau demands that three soldiers be selected by lot to be executed as an example to rest of the troops. Acting as defense attorney, Colonel Dax pleads eloquently for the lives of the unfortunate three, but their fate is a done deal. Even an eleventh-hour piece of evidence proving Mireau's incompetence is ignored by the smirking Broulard, who is only interested in putting on a show of bravado.The movie was a failure when first released since it was banned outright in France for several years, Paths of Glory has since taken its place in the pantheon of classic war movies, its message growing only more pertinent and potent with each passing year.It was especially popular during the Vietnam era.This masterpiece still packs a wallop, though nothing in it is as simple as it may first appear; audiences are still arguing about the final sequence, which has been characterized as everything from a sentimental cop-out to the ultimate cynical twist.And most of all,it is all about that greatest of all movie subjects: power.",10,1,2,29 February 2012
Back to the Future Part II," A Fun Back To The Future Sequel
","Getting back was only the beginning as the most spectacular time-travel adventure ever continues in Back to the Future Part II,a sequel that proves that lightning can strike twice.This science fiction comedy was directed by Robert Zemeckis, scripted by Bob Gale and stars Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Thomas F. Wilson and Lea Thompson.Picking up precisely where they left off, Marty and Doc launch themselves to the year 2015 to fine-tune the future and inadvertently disrupt the space time continuum. Now, their only chance to fix the present is by going back to 1955 all over again before it is too late.When in pops that crazy inventor Dr. Emmett Brown brings with news that in order to prevent a series of events that could ruin the McFly name for posterity, Marty McFly and his girlfriend are whisked into the future to the year 2015, where Marty must tangle with a teen rogue named Griff, who's obviously the descendant of Biff, the first Future film's bully. Marty foils Griff and his group when he jumps on an air-foil skateboard that flies him through town at rakish speeds with the loser bullies beaten again. Marty gets a money-making brainstorm before hopping in the time-traveling DeLorean, and he purchases a sports almanac. He figures that back in 1985 he'll be able to place sure-fire bets using the published sports scores of the games that are yet to happen. Unfortunately for Marty, Dr. Brown disapproves of his betting scheme wherein he feels too much messing with time is very dangerous and he tosses the almanac. A hidden Biff overhears the discussion about the almanac, sees it get tossed out, and grabs it. Thus begins a time- traveling swirl to make the head spin. Biff swipes the DeLorean, heads back to 1955, and with the help of the unerring almanac, bets his way to power. The now-altered 'Biff world' has turned into a nightmarish scene with Biff the mogul, residing in a Vegas-styled pleasure palace and running everything. It's all our hero Marty can do to pull the pieces together this time, as he must jump between three generations of intertwined time travel.Sure, this sequel has a clunky first act - which takes place in a hilariously overblown futuristic society - but the film knows just how, and when, to entertain us, and it does so in spades.The film works best through its magnificent technical achievements particularly the visual effects and the inherent charm of Fox, Lloyd and, especially, the delightfully menacing Thomas F. Wilson. Director Robert Zemeckis and cast bent over backwards to add layers of time-travel complication to this follow-up, and while it surely exercises the brain it isn't necessarily funny in the same way that its predecessor was. It's well worth a visit, though, just to appreciate the imagination that went into it, particularly in a finale that has Fox's character watching his own actions from the first film.",9,3,4,24 October 2012

The Royal Family, while on their summer residence at Balmoral Castle, sees her death as a private affair, not to be treated as an official Royal death, in contrast with newly appointed Prime Minister Tony Blair and Diana's ex-husband Prince Charles, who attempt to reflect the public wish for an official expression of grief. Matters are further complicated by the media, royal protocol regarding Diana's official status, and wider issues about republicanism.Full of wit, humor, and pathos, this moving portrait of the British royals during the period after Princess Diana's death features not one but two remarkable performances, that of Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II and Michael Sheen as the newly-ordained Prime Minister Tony Blair. They embody their characters and lay bare the motivations behind these prominent people, giving viewers a glimpse into the inner workings of the British monarchy.This movie allows us to understand just how heavy the crown really sits and what is it like to be the Queen.In summary,it was an unqualified triumph that works on all levels.",10,3,4,16 September 2012
Blow," All About A Cocaine Dealer
","Following the life of cocaine-trafficking pioneer in a way that recalls Martin Scorsese's Casino, Blow recounts the man's days from his 1950's childhood in Boston to his downfall in the 1980's.This biopic about the American cocaine smuggler George Jung stars Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz together with Jordi Mollà,Ray Liotta,Paul Reubens,Franka Potente and Rachel Griffiths. David McKenna and Nick Cassavetes adapted Bruce Porter's 1993 book Blow: How a Small Town Boy Made $100 Million with the Medellín Cocaine Cartel and Lost It All for the screenplay. It is based on the real life stories of George Jung, Pablo Escobar, Carlos Lehder, and the Medellín Cartel. The film's title comes from a slang term for cocaine.The film was directed by Ted Demme.George begins his life as the son of Fred, an earnest breadwinner, and Ermine, who frequently walks out on them in pursuit of a more fulfilling life. When George moves west to California in the late '60's, accompanied by best pal Tuna, he becomes an entrepreneur in the marijuana business, which soon spreads to the East Coast as well, with girlfriend Barbara smuggling the product during her stewardess shifts. George is arrested in 1972 at which time Barbara dies of cancer -- but George finds a new ally in Diego, who proposes the idea that he become the American conduit for Colombian kingpin Pablo Escobar. George flourishes in the heyday of the disco era, and falls for Mirtha, a self- serving bombshell who eventually has a daughter with him. Trouble escalates as the FBI threatens to bring George and his crew down, while he desperately tries to be a stable parent to his young offspring.Johnny Depp gives a spellbindingly naturalistic performance that puts a sympathetic face on a powerfully individualistic man unable to shake a world of crime that brought him immense riches and eventually cost him everything he cared about.With elements that seem borrowed from movies like Goodfellas and Boogie Nights, Blow is pretty much been-there-done- that despite another excellent performance from Depp. It, also, becomes too sentimental at the end.But nevertheless,isn't really a classic but it's a sobering story well-told that is why it deserves the highest rating.",10,1,1,27 October 2012
Raging Bull," One Of The Best Films Made In The 80's
","Raging Bull is a biographical sports drama film directed by Martin Scorsese, and adapted by Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin from Jake LaMotta's memoir Raging Bull: My Story. It stars Robert De Niro as Jake LaMotta, a middleweight boxer whose sadomasochistic rage, sexual jealousy, and animalistic appetite destroyed his relationship with his wife and family. Also featured in the film are Joe Pesci as Joey, La Motta's well-intentioned brother and manager who tries to help Jake battle his inner demons; and Cathy Moriarty as his abused wife. The film features supporting roles from Nicholas Colasanto, Theresa Saldana, and Frank Vincent.Scorsese's brutal character study incisively portrays the true rise and fall and redemption of middleweight boxer Jake La Motta, a violent man in and out of the ring who thrives on his ability to take a beating. Opening with the spectacle of the over-the-hill La Motta practicing his 1960s night-club act, the film flashes back to 1940s New York, when Jake's career is on the rise. Despite pressure from the local mobsters, Jake trusts his brother Joey to help him make it to a title bout against Sugar Ray Robinson the honest way; the Mob, however, will not cave in. Jake gets the title bout, and blonde teenage second wife Vickie, but success does nothing to exorcise his demons, even as he channels his rage into boxing. Alienating Vickie and Joey, and disastrously gaining weight, Jake has destroyed his personal and professional lives by the 1950s. After he hits bottom, however, Jake emerges with a gleam of self- awareness, as he sits rehearsing Marlon Brando's On the Waterfront speech in his dressing room mirror: 'I coulda been a contender, I coulda been somebody.' Working with a script adapted by Mardik Martin and Paul Schrader from La Motta's memoirs, Scorsese and De Niro sought to make an uncompromising portrait of an unlikable man and his ruthless profession. Eschewing uplifting Rocky-like boxing movie conventions, their Jake is relentlessly cruel and self-destructive; the only peace he can make is with himself. Michael Chapman's stark black-and-white photography creates a documentary/tabloid realism; the production famously shut down so that De Niro could gain 50-plus pounds.Though Raging Bull has only three principal characters, it is a big film, its territory being the landscape of the soul.Also,it is arguably Martin Scorsese's and Robert De Niro's finest film as it is often painful to watch, but it's a searing, powerful work about an unsympathetic hero.For that reasons alone,it is a boxing movie masterpiece still brutal,bloody and one of the best films made during the 80's.",10,2,2,27 February 2012
Taken 2," A Passable And Entertaining Sequel
","Taken 2 is an action thriller that features Liam Neeson,who returns as Bryan Mills, the retired CIA agent who stopped at nothing to save his daughter Kim from kidnappers,in this sequel of the first film entitled,Taken.It also stars Maggie Grace,Famke Janssen and Rade erbedija - all of whom co-star to play key supporting roles.It is directed by Olivier Megaton.After the events in Paris, family members of the men whom Bryan Mills killed while searching for his daughter, Kim, return to their hometown, Tropojë, Albania, for the funeral of the men whom Bryan had killed. During the ceremony, Murad Hoxha, the employer of the men and father of Marko, a victim whom Bryan killed by electrocution, states that they will find Bryan to avenge the deaths of their loved ones.When the father of one of the villains Bryan killed swears revenge, and takes Bryan and his wife hostage in Istanbul, Bryan enlists Kim to help them escape. Bryan then employs his unique tactics to get his family to safety and systematically take out the kidnappers, one by one.Liam Neeson, despite having turned 60 in June, looks spiritedly enough in the role, and more than capable of another go-round should Taken 2 match its predecessor's success.Unfortunately,it is more of the same, except a little bigger and a little less invigorating.This sequel is simply made for Neeson to cater to his fans as it just provides the viewer heavy doses of action to entertain.Overall,it is just a passable and entertaining sequel and nothing more.",8,1,1,15 October 2012
Mary and Max," A Unique Friendship
","Mary and Max is an Australian clay-animated black comedy-drama film written and directed by Adam Elliot and produced by Melanie Coombs. The voice cast included Philip Seymour Hoffman, Toni Collette, Eric Bana, Bethany Whitmore, with narration by Barry Humphries.The Academy Award-winning director of Harvie Krumpet returns to the world of clay animation with this simple tale of the innocent correspondence between a portly eight year old girl from the suburbs of Melbourne and a morbidly obese, middle-aged Jewish New Yorker suffering from Asperger's Syndrome.On the surface it would seem that Mary and Max would have little in common, but over the course of twenty years, the unlikely pen pals exchange letters discussing everything from taxidermy, trust, pets, religion, obesity, autism, agoraphobia, alcoholism, and just about any other topic that comes to mind as they sit down and put pen to paper.The film's humor throughout is rooted in a general malaise that afflicts both characters.It is a lovingly crafted, startlingly inventive piece of animation whose technical craft is equaled by its emotional resonance.The animation style, done mostly in a gray to black palette with an overall droopy look, enhances the melancholic feeling that exudes from this intriguing story. Funny details, too, make it suitable for kids and it is a uniquely bittersweet film starring two clay- sculpted outcasts with a unique friendship.",10,1,3,21 October 2012
The Silence of the Lambs," A Great Film In The 90's
","It is one great film. No question about it.The Silence Of Lambs is rare American thriller film that blends elements of the crime and horror genre that is based on the novel of the same name by Thomas Harris, his second to feature Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer after The Red Dragon. The movie stars Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Ted Levine and Scott Glenn. It was directed by Jonathan Demme,who won an Academy Award for this film.The story of the film centers on Clarice Starling,played by Foster in an Oscar winning performance.She is a young FBI trainee that seeks the advice of the imprisoned Dr. Lecter,played by Hopkins in his Oscar winning performance as well just like Foster, to help apprehend another serial killer, known only as 'Buffalo Bill'.The movie was smart especially in the intellectual tug-of-war between Sterling and Lecter.The Award winning performances truly made it credible and suspenseful.At the same time,the story was full of horror that will thrill the viewer to the edge of their seats. What makes Silence rise above the other movies of the same genre was its smart story as well as the movie's ability to put the viewer into the psychological inner workings of the minds of both Sterling and Lecter during their meetings.This is what makes is one of the best films ever made not only in the year but also during its decade of its release as well.",10,4,9,17 October 2011
Vanilla Sky," A Different Type Of Psychological Thriller
","Vanilla Sky is co-produced,co-written and directed by Cameron Crowe. The film stars Tom Cruise, Penélope Cruz and Cameron Diaz, with Jason Lee and Kurt Russell.It is a remake of the 1997 Spanish movie Abre los ojos (Open Your Eyes).The movie is a psychological thriller about David Aames,a successful publisher who takes all he has for granted; his wealth, his inherited company, his good looks and his relationships.It catches up to him when a friend/casual sex-partner is disappointed with their relationship and leads him to a car accident.Then the movie transform itself into a surrealistic psychological film. I had to see this film twice to fully understand and appreciate the story of the movie.It is not a film for everyone as it consists of symbols and meanings.The performances were great in this film particularly that of Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. The music in the movie was great as well featuring outstanding original song, Vanilla Sky by Paul McCartney; and two Radiohead songs, Everything In Its Right Place and I Might Be Wrong.A highly recommended film for people who are into psychology and who wants deep thinking when watching a film feature.",10,1,2,9 October 2011
Fifty Shades of Grey," Fails To Translate Kinkiness On The Big Screen
","Fifty Shades of Grey is a film adaptation of the novel of the same title by E.L. James that tells about the steamy tale between an English Literature college student who began an awkward relationship with a young billionaire.It stars Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan together with Jennifer Ehle,Eloise Mumford and Marcia Gay Harden.The film by Samuel Taylor-Johnson starts when Anastasia Steel covers for her roommate Kate Kavanagh and gets to interview Christian Grey,a young business magnate for their school paper.Upon their meeting,they became fascinated and interested with each other that they decided to get to know more of each other.This led to a complex relationship that is characterized by BDSM.It could have shown great promise as we get to know Anastasia and Christian and how their relationship started and later progressed developed when sadomasochism became an important part of it.Too bad that both Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan lacked chemistry that their relationship just seemed more like a contract negotiation rather than a romantic relationship between two complex characters and conflicted individuals.Their portrayal were simply much too be desired from that the viewer would not be simply interested on them.Added to that,the sadomasochistic sex scenes were simply horrible as they lacked realism.It was obvious that both actors are uncomfortable with these scenes and lack believability while performing them.Also,it was evident that both Dakota and Jamie were never at ease with each other.Aside from that,the Kelly Marcel's screenplay provides a lot of confusion and many unanswered questions into the story.One watching it may feel frustrated in trying to get to know more about Anastasia and Christian as to their eccentric behavior and weird personalities.In the end,the complexities on their characters made the story a simplistic one that a romantic comedy would have had more depth and would make much more sense.What's worse,the conclusion would simply left the viewer hanging as it ended abruptly.It was obviously a sequel- baiting for the viewer but it just highlighted what a poor movie the producers have made.If there is one thing that I would have credited to the movie,it will probably be the guts of the producers to do a movie about BDSM for these aren't really familiar themes made for films.Too bad that Fifty Shades of Grey fell way short of the expectations as it simply failed to translate the kinkiness into the big screen.Despite the fact that it made lots of money at the box office,it only proves that sex remains a motivating factor for people to come into the theaters.",4,3,5,31 October 2015
The Dark Knight Rises," It Solidifies Nolan's Batman Franchise
","The Dark Knight Rises is a superhero film directed by Christopher Nolan, who co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Jonathan Nolan and the story with David S. Goyer. Featuring the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the third and final installment in Nolan's Batman film trilogy, and it is the sequel to The Dark Knight. Christian Bale reprises the lead role of Bruce Wayne and Batman, with a returning cast of Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth, Gary Oldman as James Gordon, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, and Cillian Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane. It introduces two main characters to Nolan's series: Selina Kyle,portrayed by Anne Hathaway, a cat burglar whose appearance in Gotham City sets in motion a chain of events that leads Batman to come out of retirement; and Bane,played by Tom Hardy, a mercenary whose objective is to destroy Gotham with a thermonuclear weapon.It has been eight years since Batman vanished into the night, turning, in that instant, from hero to fugitive. Assuming the blame for the death of D.A. Harvey Dent, the Dark Knight sacrificed everything for what he and Commissioner Gordon both hoped was the greater good. For a time the lie worked, as criminal activity in Gotham City was crushed under the weight of the anti-crime Dent Act. But everything will change with the arrival of a cunning cat burglar with a mysterious agenda. Far more dangerous, however, is the emergence of Bane, a masked terrorist whose ruthless plans for Gotham drive Bruce out of his self-imposed exile. But even if he dons the cape and cowl again, Batman may be no match for Bane.There was an opportunity here for Nolan to show us another way, to stretch the boundaries of what is possible in a superhero film. Instead, alas, the latter half of The Dark Knight Rises retreats toward conventionality.But nevertheless,it solidifies this three-part tale of the Batman legend as one of the best ever told.Added to that,it is an intelligent, gripping, complex and suitably satisfying end to what is now and could now regarded as the best comic adaptation trilogy of all time even this film it doesn't quite meet the high standard set by its predecessor.",10,3,8,19 October 2012
The Croods," A First Rate Animation
","The Croods is a 3D computer-animated adventure comedy that features the voices of Nicolas Cage, Emma Stone, Ryan Reynolds, Catherine Keener, Clark Duke, and Cloris Leachman. The film is set in a prehistoric era known as The Croodaceous, a period which contains fantastical creatures, when a man's position as a 'Leader of the Hunt' is threatened by the arrival of a prehistoric genius who comes up with revolutionary new inventions, like fire, as they trek through a dangerous but exotic land in search of a new home. When their cave is destroyed, the Crood family must embark on a comedy adventure into strange and spectacular territory in search of a new home. As if patriarch Grug didn't already have enough to handle, it goes from bad to worse when they encounter an imaginative nomad named Guy. With Guy's help the Croods conquer their fear of the outside world and discover that they have exactly what it takes to survive each other.The film was written and directed by Kirk DeMicco and Chris Sanders.The animation is first-rate, with moments of genuine visual imagination, and the story, while unremarkable, is entirely adequate as captures the wonder and more gently, the anxiety of discovery time and time again.Added to that,it is simple enough in its story and structure that its emotional honesty and touching message will catch you quite off- guard.As family viewing, it's pleasant enough.Obviously,it is primitive but in a digitally sophisticated way that's boisterous,humorous and fun to watch.Truly an enjoyable family film with excellent visuals and interesting characters.",10,1,1,22 April 2013

McGinley, Charlton Heston, Ann-Margret, Lauren Holly, Bill Bellamy, Lela Rochon, Aaron Eckhart, Elizabeth Berkley, Marty Wright, and legendary NFL players Jim Brown and Lawrence Taylor.Aside from that,it also featured many American football players including Dick Butkus, Y.A. Tittle, Pat Toomay, Warren Moon, Johnny Unitas, Ricky Watters, Emmitt Smith and Terrell Owens together with American football coach Barry Switzer. It was co-written and directed by Oliver Stone.Tony D'Amato, the head coach of the Miami Sharks, won back-to-back championships four years ago. But new team owner Christina Pagniacci has little enthusiasm for the finer points of the game and is concerned only with the bottom line. The longtime strongman of Tony's team has been 'Cap' Rooney, a 39-year-old quarterback, but Christina balks at renewing his contract. When Cap is injured during a game, third-string rookie quarterback Willie Beaman goes on in his place and becomes a major star. But Beaman is mostly interested in fame and money, and he has little regard for Tony and his teammates. The film tries its best to depict professional American football as it looks at the best and the worst on the sport.Although the performances of the actors are far from disappointing,the film becomes an exercise of clichés and unoriginal ideas required by the plot.Also,the film does not focus on the primary theme it wants to focus on or the message it wants to convey about pro football despite of the passionate performances and brilliant film making from Stone.Overall,Any Given Sunday still entertains and remains an enjoyable sports film.",8,1,2,30 October 2011
Iron Man," A Great Superhero Movie
","Iron Man is a superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. Directed by Jon Favreau, the film stars Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark, an industrialist and master engineer who builds a powered exoskeleton and becomes the technologically advanced superhero Iron Man. Gwyneth Paltrow plays his personal assistant Pepper Potts, Terrence Howard plays military liaison James Rhodes, and Jeff Bridges plays Stark Industries executive Obadiah Stane.Tony Stark is a wealthy philanthropist.In addition to being filthy rich, billionaire industrialist he is also a genius inventor. When Stark is kidnapped and forced to build a diabolical weapon, he instead uses his intelligence and ingenuity to construct an indestructible suit of armor and escape his captors. Once free, Stark discovers a deadly conspiracy that could destabilize the entire globe, and dons his powerful new suit on a mission to stop the villains and save the world. Jim 'Rhodey' Rhodes, one of Stark's colleagues, whose military background leads him to help in the formation of the suit. This is an appealing superhero movie. It's also clunky. It's welded together out of disparate pieces that clank and ping. Though at times it's leaden, Iron Man also has enough moments of pizazz to intermittently soar.Robert Downey Jr. gives a nicely sardonic performance as Tony Stark, a rich playboy and the brilliant heir to his father's weapons manufacturing dynasty.He powers the lift-off separating this from most other superhero movies.Overall,this is one smart, high impact superhero movie one that even non-comics fans can enjoy.",10,1,3,3 October 2012
Creed II," Stallone Will Portray Rocky And Rambo For The Rest Of His Life
","Sylvester Stallone is once again making another movie from Rambo franchise entitled,'Rambo:The Last Blood' which will be shown on September 2019. I just saw the trailer and it shows that Stallone is trying to make another movie of his iconic roles.When Rocky VI a.k.a Rocky Balboa was made,I thought that Stallone would finally say goodbye to Rocky.But apparently,he isn't saying goodbye as he once again made Creed.When it did well in the box office,he once again made another sequel entitled,'Creed II'.'Creed II' stars Michael B. Jordan in the title role as Adonis Creed,the illegitimate son of Rocky's opponent,Apollo Creed. He co-stars with obviously Stallone and Tessa Thompson. In this movie,it also stars Dolph Lundgren as Ivan Drago. It was obvious that the movie will have themes from the Rocky franchise with the presence of Drago and his son,Victor. It was evident that it will comes with the match of both Adonis Creed and Victor Drago in the ring.As expected,anyone who has seen the Rocky franchise particularly 'Rocky IV' knows what to expect on the emotions on this upcoming bout. Added to that,we also witness how Adonis is affected by his new found fame after he became a boxing champion. Finally,we also get to witness how a person cannot escape one's family history.In short,the movie has a little theme from 'Rocky III' and a lot of themes from 'Rocky IV'.It is apparent that the movie did well in the box office.With that in mind, we get to witness that Stallone will continue to portray Rocky until the end of his life.Knowing that he is a limited actor who lives by Rocky and Rambo,he will definitely continue with this Rocky spin-off franchise.Going back to the 'Rambo:The Last Blood',Stallone stated that he is doing his final film as John Rambo BUT if it does well in the box office,he will continue portray Rambo. Apparently,that has already applied to his other iconic role,Rocky with the Creed franchise.",7,1,3,15 July 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Superheroes Have Become Worse Than Villains
","The new sequel of Man Of Steel presents us with Batman v Superman:Dawn Of Justice. Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck stars as Superman and Batman respectively together with an ensemble cast that includes Amy Adams,Jesse Eisenberg,Diane Lane,Laurence Fishburne, Jeremy Irons,Holly Hunter and Gal Gadot as the new Wonder Woman.With the screenplay,we are treated to a story that has Lex Luthor manipulate Batman into clashing with Superman with whom he is obsessed of defeating.I was expecting an improvement in this sequel of Man Of Steel but too bad it came out more disappointing compared to the first film.With Zack Synder once again at helm as director,the viewers are treated with what else? A visual spectacle and nothing more. Action fans will definitely be treated with 3D action sequences and a lot of violent scenes.Special effects are great and the appearance of Wonder Woman will definitely entice viewers in watching her own solo film.But that's all to it in this film.Too bad that just like the first film,Batman vs Superman: Dawn Of Justice is once again style over substance. The screenplay is poorly written and the story is just too dark that Superman and Batman fans are treated to superheroes whose psychology are close to that of killers,psychopaths and people with personality disorder.That's right.Superman is still struggling into how much responsibility of doing good on planet Earth just like in the first film.He is still mixed up of either living a normal life with Lois Lane or being too altruistic in helping people that are in trouble.Meanwhile,Batman came out as a darker character which is far worse than the villains that he is up against like Joker,Riddler and the likes. Aren't these superheroes good and moral people who do good?Anyway,that's how they turn out here.The change on the character of Batman was definitely bizarre and outlandish that even many people would probably be surprised especially the long-time fans of the hero.And what about the logic in the story?How could Batman beat Superman?How absurd!!!!!The producers have to do it because Ben Affleck a bigger movie star compared than Henry Cavill. I hope not!!!LOL What's worse,the story is overlong and somewhat slow in its development.Here is hoping that Zack Synder should start changing his approach on doing these superhero films and start doing things that would have the mainstream audience appreciate it.Or else,more fans would catch up with him especially if continues to turn superheroes into dark characters that are far worse than villains.",5,2,5,5 November 2016
Blade Runner," A Science Fiction Futuristic Film Masterpiece
","A blend of science fiction and noir detective fiction, Blade Runner was a box office and critical bust upon its initial exhibition, but its unique postmodern production design became hugely influential within the sci-fi genre, and the film gained a significant cult following that increased its stature. This film directed by Ridley Scott features Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, and Sean Young. The screenplay, written by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples, is loosely based on the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick.It depicts a dystopian Los Angeles in November 2019 in which genetically engineered organic robots called replicants—visually indistinguishable from adult humans—are manufactured by the powerful Tyrell Corporation as well as by other 'mega–manufacturers' around the world. Their use on Earth is banned and replicants are exclusively used for dangerous, menial or leisure work on off-world colonies. Replicants who defy the ban and return to Earth are hunted down and 'retired' by police special operatives known as 'Blade Runners'. The plot focuses on a brutal and cunning group of recently escaped replicants hiding in Los Angeles and the burnt out expert Blade Runner, Rick Deckard, who reluctantly agrees to take on one more assignment to hunt them down.a retired cop in Los Angeles circa 2019. L.A. has become a pan-cultural dystopia of corporate advertising, pollution and flying automobiles, as well as replicants, human-like androids with short life spans built by the Tyrell Corporation for use in dangerous off-world colonization. Deckard's former job in the police department was as a talented blade runner, a euphemism for detectives that hunt down and assassinate rogue replicants. Called before his one-time superior, Deckard is forced back into active duty. A quartet of replicants led by Roy Batty has escaped and headed to Earth, killing several humans in the process. After meeting with the eccentric Eldon Tyrell, creator of the replicants, Deckard finds and eliminates Zhora, one of his targets. Attacked by another replicant, Leon, Deckard is about to be killed when he's saved by Rachael, Tyrell's assistant and a replicant who's unaware of her true nature. In the meantime, Batty and his replicant pleasure model lover, Pris use a dying inventor, J.F. Sebastian to get close to Tyrell and murder him. Deckard tracks the pair to Sebastian's, where a bloody and violent final confrontation between Deckard and Batty takes place on a skyscraper rooftop high above the city. Misunderstood when it first hit theaters, the influence of Ridley Scott's mysterious, neo-noir Blade Runner has deepened with time.From the opening shot of a Los Angeles cityscape at night in the year 2019, it is clear that Scott has conjured up something special.The movie's spectacular futuristic vision of Los Angeles--a perpetually dark and rainy metropolis that's the nightmare antithesis of 'Sunny Southern California'--is still its most seductive feature, an otherworldly atmosphere in which you can immerse yourself. The movie's shadowy visual style, along with its classic private-detective/murder-mystery plot line makes it one of the few science fiction pictures to legitimately claim a place in the film noir tradition.Added to that,it's an overwhelming, immersive experience, a total creation of a possible future so complete that you don't need exposition to know how we got from here to there Overall,it is a visually remarkable, achingly human sci-fi masterpiece.",10,1,4,24 October 2012
Bruce Almighty," Jim Carrey Is God
","Bruce Almighty is a fantasy comedy about a down-on-his-luck TV reporter who complains to God that He isn't doing His job correctly, and is then offered the chance to try being God himself for one week.It stars Jim Carrey together with Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Aniston, Steve Carell, Catherine Bell, Lisa Ann Walter, and Philip Baker Hall.It was directed by Tom Shadyac, who previously teamed with Jim Carrey for Liar, Liar and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.Bruce Nolan is a TV reporter working in Buffalo, NY, who has been growing increasingly dissatisfied with his existence, and after an especially bad day, he flies into a rage and curses God for making his life miserable. To Bruce's great surprise, the Supreme Being Himself appears, and tries to convince Bruce of the enormity of his task. Bruce, however, isn't buying it, so God gives him a chance to find out what he's up against.Also,He bestows all of his powers on Bruce for a week, to see how he'd handle things. At first, Bruce has a great time bending the world around him to his will, much to the puzzlement of his girlfriend, Grace, but after six days God stops by to remind Bruce he hasn't done much to make the Earth a better place. Disappointed, God presents Bruce with an ultimatum wherein he has one day to improve the world in a concrete way, or God will toss the planet back into the void. Carrey is hilarious in the slapstick scenes being the Supreme Almighty and it has an interesting premise wherein he plays God.Also,the film mostly succeeds at fusing his talents as a comedian which makes it a funny and heartwarming movie.It is the kind of movie that is made for Jim Carrey himself and no one could play the main character perfectly except him.",9,1,1,23 September 2012
Ben-Hur," One Of The Best Epics That Came Out Of Hollywood
","Ben-Hur is an epic historical drama film set in ancient Rome starring Charlton Heston in the title role of a rebellious Israelite Jew who takes on the Roman Empire during the time of Christ.Included in the cast are Stephen Boyd, Jack Hawkins, Hugh Griffith and Haya Harareet.It was directed by William Wyler.In AD 26, Judah Ben-Hur is a wealthy prince and merchant in Jerusalem. His childhood friend, the Roman citizen Messala, is now a tribune. After several years away from Jerusalem, Messala returns as the new commander of the Roman garrison. Messala believes in the glory of Rome and its imperial power, while Ben-Hur is devoted to his faith and the freedom of the Jewish people. Messala asks Ben-Hur for the names of Jews who criticize the Romans. Ben-Hur refuses.Ben-Hur lives with his mother, Miriam, and sister, Tirzah. Their loyal slave Simonides is preparing for an arranged marriage for his daughter, Esther. Ben-Hur gives Esther her freedom as a wedding present, and the audience is shown that Ben-Hur and Esther are in love even though her marriage to another man is imminent. During the parade for the new governor of Judea, Valerius Gratus, a tile falls from the roof of Ben-Hur's house. Gratus is thrown from his horse and nearly killed. Although Messala knows this was an accident, he condemns Ben-Hur to the galleys and imprisons Miriam and Tirzah. By punishing a known friend and prominent citizen, he hopes to intimidate the Jewish populace. Ben-Hur swears to take revenge. Dying of thirst when his slave gang arrives at Nazareth, Ben-Hur collapses. But a local carpenter (whom the audience realizes is Jesus) gives him water.After three years as a galley slave, Ben-Hur is assigned to the flagship of the Roman Consul Quintus Arrius, who has been charged with destroying a fleet of Macedonian pirates. Arrius admires Ben-Hur's self-discipline and offers to train him as a gladiator or charioteer. Ben-Hur declines the offer, declaring that God will aid him in his quest for vengeance. The Roman fleet encounters the Macedonians. Arrius orders all the rowers except Ben-Hur to be chained to their benches. Arrius' galley is rammed and sunk, but Ben-Hur unchains the other rowers, and saves Arrius' life. Arrius believes the battle ended in defeat, but Ben-Hur prevents him from committing suicide. Ben-Hur and Arrius are rescued, and Arrius is credited with the Roman fleet's victory. The consul successfully petitions Emperor Tiberius to free Ben-Hur, and adopts him as his son. Several years pass off-screen. Now wealthy, Ben-Hur learns Roman ways and becomes a champion charioteer, but longs for his family and homeland.Ben-Hur returns to Judea. Along the way, he meets Balthasar and an Arab sheik, Ilderim . The sheik has heard of Ben-Hur's prowess as a charioteer, and asks him to drive his quadriga in a race before the new Judean governor Pontius Pilate. Ben-Hur declines, even after he learns that champion charioteer Messala will also compete.Ben-Hur returns to his home in Jerusalem. He meets Esther, and learns her arranged marriage did not occur and that she is still in love with him. He visits Messala and demands his mother and sister's freedom. The Romans discover that Miriam and Tirzah contracted leprosy in prison, and expel them from the city. The women beg Esther to conceal their condition from Ben-Hur, so she tells him that his mother and sister died. It is then that he changes his mind and decides to seek vengeance on Messala by competing against him in the chariot race. During the chariot race, Messala drives a chariot with blades on the hubs to tear apart competing vehicles. In the violent and grueling race, Messala attempts to destroy Ben-Hur's chariot but destroys his own instead. Messala is mortally injured, while Ben-Hur wins the race. Before dying, Messala tells Ben-Hur that 'the race is not over' and that he can find his family 'in the Valley of the Lepers, if you can recognize them.' Ben-Hur visits the nearby leper colony, where (hidden from their view) he sees his mother and sister.Esther hears Jesus preach the Sermon on the Mount, and tells Ben-Hur about the message of peace and forgiveness she heard. Blaming Roman rule for his family's fate, Ben-Hur rejects his patrimony and Roman citizenship. Learning that Tirzah is dying, Ben-Hur and Esther take her and Miriam to see Jesus, but the trial of Jesus before Pontius Pilate has begun. Jesus begins his march to Calvary and stumbles before Ben- Hur. Recognizing Jesus from their earlier meeting, Ben-Hur attempts to give him water but guards separate them.Ben-Hur witnesses the crucifixion of Jesus. Miriam and Tirzah are miraculously healed. Ben-Hur tells Esther that he heard Jesus talk of forgiveness while on the cross, and says 'I felt His voice take the sword out of my hand.'This is a masterpiece of epic film-making, a profound religious experience and one of the greatest films ever made.It won a record 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, an accomplishment that was not equaled until many years later by Titanic in 1997 and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King in 2003.In the lead, Heston is stiff, and the writing is uneven, but overall, it's a rousing epic done on a massive scale with hundreds of sets and extras, and a priceless race scene that could still be appreciated at present.Finally,it is one of the most powerful and successful biblical epics ever to come out of Hollywood.",10,2,5,17 September 2012

Trainspotting," The Horrors Of Drug Use
","Trainspotting is a British black comedy film directed by Danny Boyle based on the novel of the same title by Irvine Welsh, who played hapless drug dealer Mikey Forrester, and starring Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller, Kevin McKidd, Robert Carlyle and Kelly Macdonald. The story follows a group of heroin addicts in a late 1980's economically depressed area of Edinburgh and their passage through life. The Academy Award nominated screenplay, by John Hodge, was adapted from Welsh's novel. Beyond drug addiction, other concurrent themes in the film are exploration of the urban poverty and squalor in 'culturally rich' Edinburgh.Mark Renton, a young man with few prospects and fewer ambitions, lives in economically depressed Edinburgh. Like most of his friends, Renton is a heroin addict who loves the drug's blissful nothingness; financing his habit also provides excitement and challenges that his life otherwise lacks. Renton's two best friends are also junkies: Sick Boy, a snappy dresser obsessed with James Bond, and Spud, a guileless nerd who suggests Pee Wee Herman's debauched cousin. Renton and his pals also hang out with Begbie, a borderline psychotic who loathes junkies even though he drinks like a fish. After one too many brushes with the law, Renton kicks heroin and moves to London, where he finds a job, a flat, and something close to peace of mind. However, Sick Boy, Begbie, and Spud all arrive at his doorstep on the trail of a big score, leading Renton back into drugs and crime.THE experience of watching Trainspotting -- the electric, nasty and slick descent into the milieu of young Scottish junkies -- is a little like speeding through the digestive tract of some voracious beast.It has been attacked as pro-drug and defended as anti-drug, but actually it is simply pragmatic. It knows that addiction leads to an unmanageable, exhausting, intensely uncomfortable daily routine, and it knows that only two things make it bearable.A brutal, often times funny, other times terrifying portrayal of drug addiction in Edinburgh. Not for the faint of heart, but well worth viewing as a realistic and entertaining reminder of the horrors of drug use.",10,1,2,19 October 2012
Space Jam," Great Combo Of Basketball And Animation
","Space Jam is a family live-action and animated sports comedy film that features Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes characters.In the movie, Jordan must help the Looney Tunes gang with a basketball game against a group of outer space creatures whose plan, if they win, is to kidnap the Looney Tunes and take them to a failing intergalactic amusement park as the latest attraction.Also starring Academy Award-nominee Bill Murray and Wayne Knight. It was directed by Joe Pytka with Tony Cervone and Bruce W. Smith directing the animation. After Jordan announces his retirement from the game, he follows in his father's footsteps and turns to a career in baseball. Meanwhile, a group of criminal aliens called 'The Nerdlucks', led by their boss Mister Swackhammer plot to capture the Looney Tunes characters, who really exist in a secret animated world called Tune Land, and make them their newest attractions at Moron Mountain, a failing amusement park. Swackhammer believes enslaving the Tunes in this way will bring in more customers and save Moron Mountain from foreclosure. They arrive in Tune Land, and, seeing how short the aliens are, the Tunes, aided by a new arrival named Lola Bunny, bargain for their freedom by challenging the Nerdlucks to a basketball game. Preparing to cheat in the game, the Nerdlucks return to Earth and steal the Talent of Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson, Charles Barkley, Muggsy Bogues, and Shawn Bradley, who are rendered incapable of playing basketball as a result. The Nerdlucks use the stolen Talent to transform into gigantic creatures that the Looney Tunes are unable to defeat, re-naming themselves the Monstars in the process. To help them win, the Tunes choose and recruit Michael, and he reluctantly agrees after the Monstars squash him into the shape of a basketball and bounce him around like one. At the game's climax, The TuneSquad are down by one, and it is up to Michael to score the winning point. Extending his arm to superhuman lengths with the power of toon physics, Michael makes the basket and wins the game. He helps the Monstars realize that they're bigger than Mister Swackhammer, who confronts them for losing. Fed up with their abusive boss, the Monstars tie him up and send him to the moon. At Michael's request, they return the stolen Talent to the other players by transferring them to a basketball. This reverts the Monstars back to the tiny Nerdlucks. Refusing to return to Moron Mountain to endure humiliation from their former boss, the Nerdlucks decide to stay with the Looney Tunes, who only agree if the Nerdlucks can prove themselves to be 'Looney', which they arguably complete on the spot. Afterwards, Michael returns to Earth in the Nerdlucks' spaceship, where he makes a dramatic appearance at a baseball game to the cheers of the audience, despite being late. The next day, Michael gives the stolen Talent back to the NBA players, who immediately regain their lost skills. He is later prompted by his rivals to return to the NBA, mirroring his real-life comeback in 1996.Simpler and cruder in terms of story and technique, this is still a great deal of fun, confirming that Jordan is every bit as mythological a creature as Daffy Duck or Yosemite Sam. Cute, rambunctious, generally amusing rather than outright funny, this clever mix of live action, highlighted by the unequaled skills of basketball superstar Michael Jordan, and animated Looney Tunes antics is a must-see for adults, kids, teenagers, women, men, boys, girls, old folks, young folks, Jordan fans, Bill Murray fans, Wayne Knight fans and every Looney Tunes lover who wants to revel in Bugs Bunny and his pals at their looney tuniest. A great combination of basketball and animation.",10,9,11,29 March 2013
Bull Durham," A Classic Comedic Sports Film
","A blend of comedy, drama and romance, Bull Durham follows the intertwining of three lives brought together by the great American pastime. It is based upon the minor league experiences of writer/director Ron Shelton and depicts the players and fans of the Durham Bulls, a minor league baseball team in Durham, North Carolina. The movie stars Kevin Costner as 'Crash' Davis, a veteran catcher brought in to teach rookie pitcher Ebby Calvin 'Nuke' LaLoosh about the game in preparation for reaching the Major Leagues. Baseball groupie Annie Savoy romances Nuke but finds herself increasingly attracted to Crash. Also featured are Robert Wuhl and Trey Wilson, as well as popular baseball 'clown' Max Patkin.Crash Davis is a perennial Minor Leaguer assigned to the Durham Bulls, a hapless team with a long tradition of mediocrity. There he tutors a young, dim-witted pitching prodigy, Nuke LaLoosh in the ways of baseball, life, and love. Each strikes up a romance with Annie, the team's 'mascot' who takes it upon herself to sleep with a new player every season. Each has his/her own conflict: Crash struggles to end his career with some measure of dignity; Nuke struggles to make it to the 'big show'; and Annie struggles to find something more than a roll in the hay and of course, Crash and Nuke come into conflict over Annie's affections to further complicate matters. Kevin Costner at his funniest and most charismatic in Bull Durham, a film that's as wise about relationships as it is about minor league baseball.Also,aside from classic performances, witty and insightful script, this is about so much more than baseball and will no doubt prove to be a quiet classic.Obviously,it deserves its status among sports films, but its ongoing appeal reflects that it's something more: an old- fashioned romantic comedy that succeeds in establishing and deepening memorable characters through memorably flavorful dialogue.",10,1,1,18 October 2012

","The Deer Hunter is a drama film directed and co-written by Michael Cimino about a trio of Russian American steel worker friends and their infantry service in the Vietnam War. It stars Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, John Savage, John Cazale, Meryl Streep and George Dzundza. The story takes place in Clairton, a small working class town on the Monongahela River south of Pittsburgh and then in Vietnam, somewhere in the woodland and in Saigon.It is one of the many films about dealing with the Vietnam War that was both renowned for its tough portrayal of the war's effect on people particularly those belonging to the working class group and friendship.Mike,Nick and Stan celebrate the wedding of their friend Steve and go on a final deer hunt before the men leave for Vietnam. Mike treats hunting as a test of skill, lecturing Stan about the value of 'one shot' deer slaying and brushing off Nick's urgings to appreciate nature's beauty. As Mike ruminates post-hunt, the screenplay cuts to the horror of Vietnam, where the men are captured by Vietcong soldiers who force Mike and Nick to play Russian roulette for their amusement. Mike turns the game to his advantage so they can escape captivity, but the men are permanently scarred by the episode. Steve loses his legs. Nick vanishes in the Saigon Russian roulette parlors. Mike returns alone to Clairton a changed man, as he rejects the killing of the deer hunt and finds solace with Nick's old girlfriend Linda. Disgusted by the antics of his male cohorts at home, Mike decides to bring Steve back from a veterans' hospital, and he returns to Saigon to find Nick. As Saigon falls, Mike discovers how far gone Nick is and the survivors gather in Clairton for a funeral breakfast.This is one of the greatest films ever made about friendship and the personal impact of war. It's hardly a conventional battle film but its depiction of war on an intimate scale packs a devastatingly dramatic punch. Cimino may be manipulating our emotions with masterful skill, but he does it in a way that stirs the soul and pinches our collective nerves with graphic, high-intensity scenes of men under life-threatening duress. To the viewer, they become unforgettably intense rites of passage for the best friends who may survive or perish during their Vietnam tour through a tropical landscape of hell. Back home, their loved ones must cope with the war's domestic impact. Its greatness is enhanced by Michael Cimino's sympathetic direction and a series of heartbreaking performances especially from De Niro,Streep and Walken. Overall,the film achieves a rare combination of epic storytelling and intimate,heart-rending drama.",10,1,4,27 September 2012
Lucy," A Pleasurable Action Movie
","I Love Lucy!!!!!!!!!I am not talking about the sitcom entitled 'I Love Lucy' that featured Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz that was shown from 1951 to 1960 but rather the science fiction action film entitled 'Lucy' that was written and directed by Luc Besson.The film that stars the alluring Scarlett Johansson tells a story about a woman caught in a dark deal that gains 100% of her cerebral knowledge that led him to possess psychokinetic abilities from a brain-enhancing drug that is being absorbed into her bloodstream and turns the tables around her captors.Morgan Freeman,Choi Min-sik and Amr Waked co-stars.No question that the story focused on the theme about what would happen if humans were able to use 100% of their brain instead of the usual 10%.Despite the fact that the plot was somewhat silly and simplistic,it will definitely manage to entertain moviegoers who are watching a film with the hope of being entertained and not hoping for a classic.Some critics and viewers will despise it nevertheless but they themselves would get have been entertained one way or another especially Luc Besson's theory of what abilities Lucy will acquire as her cerebral abilities rises up from 1% up to 100% in the end.The film obviously has great Computer Graphic Imagery (CGI) effects and has lots of action scenes.The performances of the cast was also great from Johansson,Freeman and even from Old Boy star,Choi Min-sik.This is definitely one of the most pleasurable and entertaining action movies I have seen so far this year. Millions of moviegoers around the world will agree with me after it grossed $458 million world-wide when it was released.",10,3,10,28 March 2015

It tells the story of a shy waitress, played by Audrey Tautou, who decides to change the lives of those around her for the better, while struggling with her own isolation. The film was an International co-production between companies in France and Germany.Amélie Poulain is a young woman who had grown up isolated from other children. After the death of her mother and her father's subsequent withdrawal, she developed an unusually active imagination to ward away the feelings of loneliness. Now at the age of twenty-three, Amélie is a waitress at Café des 2 Moulins, a small café in Montmartre that is staffed and frequented by a collection of eccentrics. Having spurned romantic relationships following a few disappointing efforts, she finds contentment in simple pleasures and letting her imagination roam free. She is a young woman who had a decidedly unusual childhood; misdiagnosed with an unusual heart condition, Amelie didn't attend school with other children, but spent most of her time in her room, where she developed a keen imagination and an active fantasy life. Her mother Amandine died in a freak accident when Amelie was eight, and her father Raphael had limited contact with her, since his presence seemed to throw her heart into high gear. Despite all this, Amelie has grown into a healthy and beautiful young woman who works in a cafe and has a whimsical, romantic nature. When Princess Diana dies in a car wreck in the summer of 1997, Amelie is reminded that life can be fleeting and she decides it's time for her to intervene in the lives of those around her, hoping to bring a bit of happiness to her neighbors and the regulars at the cafe. Amelie starts by bringing together two lonely people -- Georgette, a tobacconist with a severe case of hypochondria, and Joseph, an especially ill-tempered customer. When Amelie finds a box of old toys in her apartment, she returns them to their former owner, Mr. Bretodeau, sending him on a reverie of childhood. Amelie befriends Dufayel, an elderly artist living nearby whose bones are so brittle, thanks to a rare disease, that everything in his flat must be padded for his protection. And Amelie decides someone has to step into the life of Nino, a lonely adult video store clerk and part-time carnival spook-show ghost who collects pictures left behind at photo booths around Paris.The feel-good Amelie is a lively, fanciful charmer, showcasing Audrey Tautou as its delightful heroine.The sunniest face and the greatest acclaim belong to Tautou, who is new to these shores. A delight in the title role, she's like a young Audrey Hepburn, making us laugh and feel empathy without feeling manipulated.Finally,Jeunet's film is an ambitious, rich, and rewarding experience, packed end-to-end with delightful creativity.",10,4,9,25 February 2012

Night Shyamalan.The movie tells the story of Cole Sear, a troubled, isolated boy who is able to see and talk to the dead, and an equally troubled child psychologist who tries to help him that established Shyamalan as a writer and director, and introduced the cinema public to his traits, most notably his affinity for surprise endings.Dr. Malcolm Crowe is a child psychologist whose new patient has a problem far outside his usual area of expertise. Cole Sear is six-years- old and claims to see the spirits of dead people all around him. It seems that Cole has psychic powers and can channel the ghosts of those who were troubled. Cole doesn't understand his powers, and he has little control over them; he's constantly terrified by what he sees, and Dr. Crowe is the only one with whom he feels he can share this secret. However, as the doctor digs deeper into Cole's strange powers, it leads to strange and unexpected consequences for both of them.An excellent premiere for new director as he packs a punch with a great story, excellent directing, a great cast, great performances, and a surprise ending that will leave you breathless for days on end. Osment is excellent, as is Bruce Willis, as a melancholy child psychologist scarred by his failure with a similarly haunted youth, and Toni Collette, as the boy's fiercely loyal mother.It was a twisty ghost story with all the style of a classical Hollywood picture but all the chills of a modern horror flick that deserves the highest rating.",10,1,1,19 October 2012

As he watches his neighbors, he assigns them such roles and character names as 'Miss Torso',a professional dancer with a healthy social life or 'Miss Lonelyhearts',a middle-aged woman who entertains nonexistent gentlemen callers. Of particular interest is seemingly mild-mannered traveling salesman Lars Thorwald, who is saddled with a nagging, invalid wife. One afternoon, Thorwald pulls down his window shade, and his wife's incessant bray comes to a sudden halt. Out of boredom, Jeffries casually concocts a scenario in which Thorwald has murdered his wife and disposed of the body in gruesome fashion. Trouble is, Jeffries' musings just might happen to be the truth. Rear Window is arguably the second best film of Alfred Hitchcock next to Vertigo.The new-of-a-kind movie during its year of release makes a murder mystery tense as well as entertaining.In it,Hitchcock's genius delivers as one of the most elegant entertainments ever made in Hollywood, and also one of the boldest and most personal of the his films since it is a work that's almost perverse in its giddy celebration of the thrill of voyeurism.",10,1,4,1 November 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A Masterpiece Of Filmmaking
","The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King brings Peter Jackson's mammoth adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic to a close in suitably epic fashion. epic fantasy-drama film directed by Peter Jackson that is based on the second and third volumes of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. It is the concluding film in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, following The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers. As Sauron launches the final stages of his conquest of Middle-earth, Gandalf the Wizard, and Théoden King of Rohan rally their forces to help defend Gondor's capital Minas Tirith from the looming threat. Aragorn finally claims the throne of Gondor and summons an army of ghosts to help him defeat Sauron. Ultimately, even with full strength of arms, they realise they cannot win; so it comes down to the Hobbits, Frodo and Sam, to bear the burden of the Ring and deal with the treachery of Gollum. After a long journey they finally arrive in the dangerous lands of Mordor, seeking to destroy the One Ring in the place it was created, the volcanic fires of Mount Doom.Notably, it won all eleven Academy Awards for which it was nominated, an Oscar record, and tied for largest number of awards won with Ben-Hur and Titanic.Instead of starting just where the previous film left off, however, it goes far back in time to the moment the tormented creature Gollum first came to possess the One Ring. In this flashback, actor Andy Serkis who voiced Gollum and performed his movements onset prior to the final CGI effects finally gets to appear on screen, portraying Gollum's former self, Sméagol. This disturbing scene serves as a potent reminder that the Ring seeks to corrupt even the well-intentioned Frodo, who is increasingly struggling with the dark power of the Ring himself. Thus, the film returns to the present, following Frodo, Sam, and Gollum as they journey ever closer to the foreboding land of Mordor. They pass by the terrifying dark city of Minas Morgul, watching as the dreadful army of the Witch King sets out for the human strongholds in Gondor, and move on to the rocky stairs to Cirith Ungol, where an even darker enemy lies in wait. Meanwhile, the rest of the Fellowship reunites in Rohan, having defeated the wizard Saruman on two different fronts, at Helm's Deep and Isengard. They are not together for long, though, since the hobbit Pippin gets into trouble, making it necessary for him and Gandalf to hastily depart for Minas Tirith, capital of Gondor. Once there, they find the steward of Gondor, Denethor, in an unstable mental state and the city preparing for battle against the amassing forces of Sauron. Denethor unwisely sends his only remaining son, Faramir, back into bloody battle to prove himself. He returns nearly dead, sending Denethor over the edge of sanity.In another realm, elf Arwen begins her journey to immortal life in the Grey Havens, on her way to leave Middle-earth -- and Aragorn -- forever, but has a vision that causes her to once again reconsider her decision. Back in Rohan, the men are preparing to ride to Gondor's aide. Éowyn desperately wants to join the men in battle, but her uncle, King Théoden, orders her to stay and defend Rohan if necessary. The hobbit Merry also desires to ride with the men, but is denied due to his small size and inexperience. Aragorn is met there by the elf Elrond, who brings him the re-forged Sword that was Broken in the ancient battle with Sauron and urges him to take a different route to Gondor. Heeding Elrond's advice, Aragorn, along with elf Legolas and dwarf Gimli, takes a cavernous path through the mountains, where they meet ghoulish ghosts who betrayed Aragorn's ancestors and are doomed to eternal unrest unless they fulfill their broken oaths by aiding him. All but Frodo, Sam, and Gollum will meet on the massive battlefield of the Pelennor before the gates of Minas Tirith. The former three instead engage in a battle of wills between each other and the One Ring as they head toward the fires of Mount Doom to destroy it. The thrilling conclusion to what has become the film event of our time - - the definitive screen fantasy -- features more spellbinding moments, bigger battles, more emotion and more poetry than the terrific first two films in the trilogy.It is visually stunning as it pops your eyes, excites your senses and brings you in as close as a whisper for scenes of startling emotion.Jackson boldly and faithfully brought J.R.R. Tolkien's world to life as he's created the most epic and sweeping fantasy adventure of all time as evidenced in this third film.Aside from that,the movie is great at all levels including the brilliance of the cast.Standing out amid an excellent cast is Elijah Wood, stymied by tweeness in the earlier films but here convincingly developing the character of Frodo as the embodiment of valor and self-sacrifice.Aside from that,it provides the viewer a great tale of heroes, bonded together by friendship and spectacular themes about very special friendship between hobbits Elijah Wood's Frodo and Sean Astin's Sam that touches us most of all.This is a masterpiece of filmmaking.",10,1,3,12 January 2012
Munich," Munich Is A Great Accomplishment
","Munich is a historical drama about the Israeli government's secret retaliation against the Black September terrorist group after the Munich massacre during the 1972 Summer Olympics.It stars Eric Bana and Daniel Craig together with Ciarán Hinds,Mathieu Kassovitz,Hanns Zischler and Geoffrey Rush. The film shows how a squad of assassins, led by former Mossad agent Avner, track down and kill a list of Black September members thought to be responsible for the murders of eleven Israeli athletes. The second part of the film, which depicts the Israeli government's response, has been debated a great deal by film critics and newspaper columnists. It is based on the book Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team by Canadian journalist George Jonas, which in turn was based on the story of Yuval Aviv, who claims to have been a Mossad agent. In the book, Aviv's story is told through a protagonist called 'Avner'.The film written by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth; and it was produced and directed by Steven Spielberg.At its core, Munich is a straightforward thriller. It's built on a relatively stock movie premise and the revenge plot: innocent people are killed, the bad guys got away with it, and someone has to make them pay. But director Steven Spielberg uses that as a starting point to delve into complex ethical questions about the cyclic nature of revenge and the moral price of violence.By all rights, Munich should be an unqualified success as it has gripping subject matter relevant to current events.It was co-written by one of America's greatest living playwrights in Tony Kushner and an accomplished screenwriter in Eric Roth.Also,it stars an appealing and likable actor in Eric Bana and it was helmed by Steven Spielberg, of all people. While it certainly is a great movie, it falls just short of the immense heights such talent should propel it to. This is due more to some questionable plot devices than anything else. But while certain aspects ring hollow, the movie as a whole is a profound accomplishment.This examination of the Israeli- Palestinian conflict in the aftermath of the Munich assassinations is politically even-handed and cinematically visceral.An absolutely good film indeed.",10,2,3,3 October 2012
The Truman Show," Jim Carrey's Career Performance
","The Truman Show is a satirical comedy-drama with a cast includes Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank, as well as Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich, Ed Harris and Natascha McElhone. The film chronicles the life of a man who is initially unaware that he is living in a constructed reality television show, broadcast around the clock to billions of people across the globe. Truman becomes suspicious of his perceived reality and embarks on a quest to discover the truth about his life.It was written by Andrew Niccol and directed by Peter Weir.Truman Burbank is unaware that his entire life is a hugely popular 24- hour-a-day TV series. Every moment of his existence is captured by concealed cameras and telecast to a giant global audience. His friends and family are actors who smile pleasantly at Truman's familiar catchphrase greeting, 'In case I don't see you later, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!' Employed at an insurance company, he is married to merry Meryl, and they live in the cheerful community of Seahaven, an island where the weather is always mild and no unpleasantness intrudes. This is the basic situation of the series, which has grown over the years into a billion-dollar franchise for the TV network. As an unwanted pregnancy, Truman was adopted by the network and raised in the zoolike environment of a TV soundstage. Thus, the TV audience became hooked when Truman was very young. Now, at age 30, he still doesn't know he's a prisoner on an immense domed city-size soundstage, simulating Seahaven. Both the illusion and the ratings will collapse if Truman ever leaves Seahaven. In addition to elaborate events staged to make sure he stays put, Truman is given constant reminders of how wonderful Seahaven is compared to dangers in other parts of the world. However, his growing suspicions make him curious enough to try to leave, and the show's director and master manipulator Christof (Ed Harris) must constantly devise ways to thwart Truman's escape attempts. To enter the harbor, Truman must overcome his fear of water.This is a funny, tender, and thought-provoking film.It is noteworthy for its remarkably prescient vision of runaway celebrity culture and a nation with an insatiable thirst for the private details of ordinary lives.The issues it tackles are just as relevant now than they were when the film was first released theatrically.Also,it has great performances from the cast especially from Jim Carrey in what may be the performance of his career.",10,4,6,27 September 2012
The Matrix," An Apocalypse Of Kinetic Joy
","The Matrix is a science fiction action film written and directed by Larry and Andy Wachowski. The film stars Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano, and Hugo Weaving.The film depicts a future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality created by sentient machines to pacify and subdue the human population, while their bodies' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source. Upon learning this, computer programmer 'Neo' is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, involving other people who have been freed from the 'dream world' and into reality.Also,it contains many references to the cyberpunk and hacker subcultures; philosophical and religious ideas such as René Descartes' evil genius, the Allegory of the Cave, the brain in a vat thought experiment; and homages to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Hong Kong action cinema, spaghetti westerns, dystopian fiction, and Japanese animation.What if virtual reality wasn't just for fun, but was being used to imprison you? That's the dilemma that faces mild-mannered computer jockey Thomas Anderson in The Matrix. It's the year 1999, and Anderson (hacker alias: Neo) works in a cubicle, manning a computer and doing a little hacking on the side. It's through this latter activity that Thomas makes the acquaintance of Morpheus, who has some interesting news for Mr. Anderson -- none of what's going on around him is real. The year is actually closer to 2199, and it seems Thomas, like most people, is a victim of The Matrix, a massive artificial intelligence system that has tapped into people's minds and created the illusion of a real world, while using their brains and bodies for energy, tossing them away like spent batteries when they're through. Morpheus, however, is convinced Neo is 'The One' who can crack open The Matrix and bring his people to both physical and psychological freedom.For those who have been waiting for movies to catch up with the graphic possibilities of comic books, wait no longer: The Matrix is among us.It is a must-see among genre fans, especially guys in their teens and 20s, for whom the script's pretentious mumbo-jumbo of undergraduate mythology, religious mysticism and technobabble could even be a plus rather than a dramatic liability.Aside from that,the balance between blockbuster-style action sequences and in-depth philosophical undertones that I've always admired about it.Overall,it is an ingenious combination of Hong Kong action, ground-breaking Hollywood FX, and an imaginative vision together with an apocalypse of kinetic joy that will truly describe watching this film.",10,1,3,26 February 2012
Shall We Dance," An American Remake Of A Japanese Movie On Ballroom Dancing
","'Shall We Dance?',an American remake of the Japanese movie,'Shall We Dansu?',is a movie about John Clark and ballroom dancing.John Clark is a man with a wonderful job as a Estates lawyer.He,too has a charming wife and a wonderful family. But despite of all these things that he possesses,he still feels that something is missing big in his life as he makes his way every day inside the train through the city of Chicago.Each evening on his train commute home, John sees a beautiful woman, staring with a melancholic expression through the window of a dance studio. Haunted by her sadness, he impulsively takes off the train one night, and signs up for ballroom dancing lessons, hoping to get to know her. It seems like a mistake. His teacher turns out to be not Paulina, but the older and alcoholic owner of the dance studio,Miss Mitzi.He proves just as clumsy just like his classmates on the dance-floor. Even worse, when he does meet Paulina, she rudely tells John to seriously study dance and not to look chance to get to have dinner with her.But, as his lessons continue, John falls in love with dancing. Keeping his new obsession a secret from his family and co-workers, he works hard and get himself involved for Chicago's biggest dance competition.The movie basically was a love story between John and his wife and how dancing gets involved in it instead of a man losing his inhibitions and not worrying about cultural and society expectations about dancing.This is where the remake falters.Aside from that,the acting by Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez are far from being decent. Also, the rest of the cast does not compare with the original.The movie as a whole lacks subtlety and fails to provide many laughs as some characters are forced to be funny especially those played by Stanley Tucci,who portrayed Link; and Lisa Ann Walter,who tried her best to be annoying as Bonnie. One simply cannot prevent from comparing this remake to the original.Nevertheless,this is still a decent remake unlike others like the horrible My Sassy Girl remake starring Elisha Cuthbert and Jesse Bradford from the great Korean classic of the movie with the same title.But not as good as The Departed,a remake of the Hong Kong Classic Infernal Affairs.Overall,it is still a good movie to watch especially for Richard Gere and JLo fans.",8,3,4,7 October 2011
Casino," The Story Behind Las Vegas
","This Martin Scorsese film,Casino,depicts Las Vegas--it has a glittering, glamorous face, as well as a brutal, cruel one.It is based on the non- fiction book of the same name by Nicholas Pileggi, who also co-wrote the screenplay for the film with Scorsese.The movie stars Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci as Ace Rothstein and Nicky Santoro respectively, mobsters who move to Las Vegas to make their mark, live and work in this paradoxical world. Seen through their eyes, each as a foil to the other, the details of mob involvement in the casinos of the 1970's and '80's are revealed. Ace is the smooth operator of the Tangiers casino, while Nicky is his boyhood friend and tough strongman, robbing and shaking down the locals. However, they each have a tragic flaw--Ace falls in love with a hustler, Ginger,played by Sharon Stone, and Nicky falls into an ever-deepening spiral of drugs and violence.The movie is definitely one of the best made about the mob.It definitely ranks up there with The Godfather and another Scorsese film,Goodfellas. Excellent story and acting are both characteristics of the movie.The story was great in the sense that it focuses on the excesses of language, of violence, of ambition in the life-styles of the rich and infamous which makes the movie smart from start to finish.Also,great performances were given by the lead stars De Niro,Stone and Pesci. Finally,it reveals to us what is Las Vegas all about - inside and out. A movie that deserves a 10/10 rating!!!!",10,4,6,17 October 2011
Heat," A Story Of A Police And A Criminal
","A great Robert De Niro and Al Pacino collaboration!!!!This is what the film,Heat,a written and directed by Michael Mann,is all about.De Niro plays Neil McCauley, a professional thief, while Pacino plays Lt. Vincent Hanna, veteran LAPD homicide detective tracking down McCauley's crew. The central conflict was based on the experiences of former Chicago police officer Chuck Adamson and his pursuit in the 1960s of a criminal named McCauley, after whom De Niro's character is named. Aside from De Niro and Pacino,the film also has an all-star ensemble that includes Val Kilmer, Jon Voight,Tom Sizemore,Diane Venora,Amy Brenneman,Ashley Judd and a young Natalie Portman - that makes the performances of this film first class.It is more than just a story of a police and criminal playing the cat- and-mouse game.The tension and conflict provided by the story definitely is far from contrived as it is honest and totally realistic.Aside from the good performances,credit also should be given to Mann.Heat is just more than an action film.It is simply one of the best crime thrillers ever made in Hollywood.It is arguably one of the best films of the 1990's if not the best.",10,1,2,17 October 2011

","In a distant galaxy, a long time ago, young Luke Skywalker assembles his motley crew of allies including space rogue Han Solo and two 'droids' -- C3PO and R2D2 -- to rescue Princess Leia, the rebel leader of her planet from the clutches of the evil Empire as embodied by its enforcer Darth Vader in Star Wars:A New Hope.It is epic space opera film series created by George Lucas. The first film in the series was originally released on 1977, under the title Star Wars, by 20th Century Fox, and became a worldwide pop culture phenomenon, followed by two sequels, released at three-year intervals. Sixteen years after the release of the trilogy's final film, the first in a new prequel trilogy of films was released. The three films were also released at three-year intervals, with the final film released on 2005.The Star Wars film series has spawned a media franchise including books, television series, video games, and comic books. These supplements to the film trilogies comprise the Star Wars Expanded Universe, and have resulted in significant development of the series' fictional universe. Obviously,it is a legendarily expansive and ambitious start to the sci- fi saga, George Lucas opened our eyes to the possibilities of blockbuster filmmaking and things have never been the same.It is a magnificent film.Lucas set out to make the biggest possible adventure fantasy out of his memories of serials and older action epics, and he succeeded brilliantly.It is a seminal movie that began a whole cycle of sci-fi works and also launched the careers of many actors and craftsmen.A sweeping epic with classical themes lifted from the teachings of Joseph Campbell, but it maintains strong central characters.And most of all,it is one of the most enduring movies of all time.",10,6,8,14 January 2012
Footloose," Footloose Remake Adds Nothing New From The Original
","Writer and Director Craig Brewer delivers a new take of the beloved 1984 classic film entitled,Footloose.Ren MacCormack,played by Kenny Wormald,is transplanted from Boston to the small southern town of Bomont where he experiences a heavy dose of culture shock. A few years prior, the community was rocked by a tragic accident that killed five teenagers after a night out and Bomont's local councilmen and the beloved Reverend Shaw Moore,played by Dennis Quaid,responded by implementing ordinances that prohibit loud music and dancing. Not one to bow to the status quo, Ren challenges the ban, revitalizing the town and falling in love with the minister's troubled daughter Ariel,portrayed by Julianne Hough, in the process.After a long night of partying, Bobby Moore and four of his friends drive over a bridge and crash into a truck. His father, Shaw Moore, the reverend of the church of the small Southern United States town of Bomont, Georgia; persuades the city council to pass several paternalistic laws, including a ban on all unsupervised dancing within the city limits. Three years later, Ren McCormack, a teenager raised in Boston, moves to Bomont to live with his uncle, aunt, and cousins after his mother's painful death from leukemia. Soon after arriving, Ren makes friends with Willard Hewitt, a fellow senior at Bomont High, and from him learns about the ban on dancing.He soon begins to be attracted to Moore's rebellious daughter Ariel, who is dating dirt-track driver Chuck Cranston. After an insult from Chuck, Ren ends up in a game of chicken involving buses, and despite his inability to drive a bus, he wins. Reverend Moore mistrusts Ren, forbidding Ariel to see him ever again. Ren and his classmates want to do away with the law and have a senior prom. After an argument about Ren, Chuck breaks up with and abuses Ariel. Moore initially wants Ren arrested, but Ariel convinces him that Chuck is the real assailant and that she isn't a virgin. She also mentions that he blames everything on Ren just like he did with his son, Bobby, who died in the car crash. Moore's wife, Vi, is supportive of the movement to allow dancing. She explains to Moore he cannot be everyone's father, and that he is hardly being a good father to Ariel. She also says that dancing and music are not the problem.Ren goes before the city council and reads several Bible verses, given to him by Ariel, that claim in ancient times people would dance to rejoice, exercise, or celebrate. Ren also teaches Willard how to dance. The city council votes against him. Undaunted, Ren convinces the owner of the cotton mill where he works to let them have a prom there; the mill is just outside the Bomont city limits. Ren goes to see Moore, knowing that Moore still has enough clout to pressure the parents not to let their teenagers come. Ren tells Moore that even though they denied the motion to dismiss the law, they cannot stop the teenagers from having the dance. He then asks him respectfully if he can take Ariel.On Sunday, Shaw asks his congregation to pray for the high school students putting on the prom. Not long after Ren and Ariel arrive at the prom, Chuck and several of his friends ride up, intent on beating up Ren. However, Ren and Willard fend them off. Ren then flings some confetti into a shredding machine and yells, 'Let's dance!'The new Footloose reboot has more energy as compared to the 1984 original.It also be commended for more energy and vitality.However,the characters, the scenes, the dancing, even much of the dialogue are all plugged into a rigidly prefabricated storyline that treats its 1984 predecessor with praise rather than updating everything for new generation audience.It was expected that the fans of the original who have probably outgrown it will judge the new film instead of the youngster who like a teen-age movie.What's worse,the movie simply can be classified as a TV movie instead of a decent feature film.",7,1,5,3 January 2012
50_50," A Humorous Inspiration For People Who Have Cancer
","Cancer survivor and screenwriter Will Reiser provides us a great and entertaining dramedy about a difficult topic in 50/50.This film that stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Seth Morgen together with Anna Kendrick,Bryce Dallas Howard and Anjelica Houston provides us a story about young man's battle with cancer.It was loosely based on Reiser's own personal experience when he himself was battling with cancer himself.The story involves Adam,who happens to be a public radio journalist in Seattle who happens to be in a relationship with Rachael and bestfriends with Kyle.After experiencing back pains,he goes to a doctor to consult about it.Later,it was revealed by his doctor that he is suffering from schwannoma neurofibrosarcoma or having cancerous tumor in the spine.It was later learned that Adam's chances of survival is 50% or 50/50 as the movie's title suggest.The screenplay revolves around how he battles with cancer from his friendship with his best buddy,his relationship with his girlfriend,the friends he met at chemotherapy who happens to be cancer patients themselves,his relationship with his mother, and his awkward relationship with his psychotherapist.Reiser's screenplay was definitely a great story about cancer patients.It was definitely moving and it captures the viewers' heart especially as we get through Adam's situation in battling cancer.We see how changes in his relationships take place.We definitely feel sorry for being young and immature in facing this disease as well as the lack of needed support he is getting from a loud-mouthed and dick bestfriend Kyle,his cheating girlfriend Rachael,his parents - a mother who constantly worries and a father who is suffering from the advanced stages of dementia - and his inexperienced psychotherapist Katherine,who apparently is more interested in having a date with him rather than helping him psychologically battle the situation he is currently facing.In the end,we feel happy for Adam as he managed to survive after undergoing an extremely dangerous situation despite the somewhat lack of support that he is getting around him. Added to that,it also provides a wonderful film that will serve as humorous inspiration for people who have cancer.",10,1,1,3 April 2016
Thirteen Days," An Efficient Movie
","Thirteen Days is a docudrama directed by Roger Donaldson about the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, seen from the perspective of the US political leadership. Kevin Costner stars, with Bruce Greenwood featured as John F. Kennedy.Donaldson teams up with Costner for another political thriller after both made No Way Out.After President John F. Kennedy is shown photographs from a spy plane detailing the presence of missiles in Cuba capable of obliterating massive areas of the U.S., he must immediately decide the most effective course of action for the country. With the aid of best friend and special assistant Kenny O'Donnell and brother Robert, the President must avoid a dire chain of events that could be dictated by General Curtis LeMay, who would rather take immediate action and invade Cuba. After initial reticence about leaking the information to the nation, President Kennedy eventually tells of the conflict, leading to widespread panic and a blockade of Cuba. With the aid of Robert McNamara and Adlai Stevenson, the leaders must find a way to alleviate the tension of the situation. The film is a good movie about a profound moment in world history.It provides more suspense than the car crashes and breathless chases of most action movies even though the outcome is known at the end.It has great performances from Costner and Greenwood,who was memorable as JFK.Also,it is easily the best film that Donaldson ever made.Overall,it was a highly competent and refreshing movie.",10,2,2,15 September 2012
Ran," Kurosawa's Last Epic
","Ran is Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa's reinterpretation of William Shakespeare's King Lear.This epic film written and directed by Kurosawa happens to be his last epic.It features Tatsuya Nakadai as Hidetora Ichimonji, an aging Sengoku-era warlord who decides to abdicate as ruler in favor of his three sons. It also stars Mieko Harada as the wife of Ichimonji's eldest son. The story is based on legends of the daimyo Mōri Motonari, as well as on the Shakespearean tragedy.The Lear counterpart is an elderly 16th-century warlord, who announces that he's about to divide his kingdom equally among his three sons.In his dotage, he falls prey to the false flattery of his treacherous sons, while banishing his youngest son, the only member of the family who loves him enough to tell him the unvarnished truth. Thanks to his foolish pride, his domain collapses under its own weight as the sons battle each other over total control. Akira Kurosawa's last film is slightly marred by some too obvious straining toward masterpiece status, yet it's a stunning achievement in epic cinema.But nevertheless,it enhances the spectacle the same way the spectacle bolsters the drama. Few other directors had Kurosawa's ability to convey the intimate as well as the epic, to handle stillness as well as violence.It's a film for the ages and one of the few genuine screen masterpieces ever released on cinema.",10,1,3,24 October 2012

The supporting cast includes: Jeffrey Tambor, Heather Graham, Jamie Chung, Mike Epps and John Goodman.Once again,it the screenplay was co-written and directed by Todd Phillips.The movie moves to another direction as there was no bachelor party and wedding.But in the end,it turned out to be somewhat a disaster as it moved from being a comedy into a dark action thriller that offers nothing compelling at all for the viewer.No wonder it was nominated for a Razzie.Overall,it was barely funny and it could even be classified as obnoxious and disgusting. One thing that could come up in the mind of the viewer while watching it is this question,'Is it time to end the franchise?'. I think that the overwhelming answer to it by then end of the movie would probably be affirmative for the good of the franchise.",5,1,2,27 December 2014

Immediately, the prisoners develop a scheme where they will leave the camp by building three separate escape tunnels.The British soldier who masterminds the whole plan, and who commands his motley squad that includes a Polish trench-digging expert,an American with a talent for theft, a masterful forger, and an American rebel through the construction of the tunnels and, eventually, their escape.A stirring example of courage and the indomitable human spirit, for many John Sturges's The Great Escape is both the definitive World War II drama and the nonpareil prison escape movie. Featuring an unequaled ensemble cast in a rivetingly authentic true-life scenario set to Elmer Bernstein's admirable music, this picture is both a template for subsequent action-adventure movies and one of the last glories of Golden Age Hollywood. Reunited with the director who made him a star in The Magnificent Seven,McQueen gives a career-defining performance as the laconic Hilts, the baseball-loving, motorbike-riding 'Cooler King.' The rest of the make the most of their meaty roles.This is an epic adventure film that runs nearly three hours that provides exciting action sequences which had never been seen before in Hollywood productions as it provides an exceptional story about teamwork.",10,1,3,26 October 2012
Click," Adam Sandler's Click Surprises
","Click is a sci-fi dramedy that stars Adam Sandler as an overworked architect that neglects his family and misses most of his life when he receives a remote-control device that enables him to skip over unpleasant events. It also stars Kate Beckinsale as his wife and Christopher Walken as the man who gives him the device. This film is loosely based on R.L. Stine short story and the screenplay is written by Mark O'Keefe and Steve Koren.It was directed by Frank Coraci.A workaholic architect, frustrated in his job but determined to make a better life for his family, is bestowed with a powerful universal remote that allows him more control over his life than he ever knew possible. On the surface, Michael Newman seems to have it all, yet with all the demands forced upon him by his ungrateful boss, Michael finds that setting aside time to spend with his loving wife,Donna and two picture- perfect children, Ben and Samantha,has grown increasingly difficult. When a frustrating bout with the television remote leads the overworked husband and father to a nearby Bed, Bath & Beyond in search of a universal remote with the power to control all of his electronic devices, a curious peek into the back room leads Michael into the company of eccentric employee and talented inventor Morty. It seems that Morty has created a device that will not only allow him complete control over his television and stereo, but his entire life as well. As he discovers that the remarkable device has the power to muffle the barks of the family dog, zoom himself past an irritating quarrel with his wife, and even allow him to travel back and forth through time to different points in his life, the rush of being able to skip straight to the good parts in life soon leaves him feeling as if he's missing out on the total experience. Only when Michael begins to realize that the he has lost control of his life and the remote is now programming him does he finally learn that life is as much about the moments he'd rather forget as it is the moments he will always remember.Adam Sandler's Click surprises as it is more than just a dramedy with a few slapstick scenes in it.The movie presents some very real problems about adult life but it answers them with Hollywood platitudes like it's about having fun not trying to find solutions to the problems of modern existence that it still seems a bit disingenuous.Although a lot of critics would find this film not good due to the fact that it presents that most adults haven't reached the maturity required and makes fun of the situation,the movie provides the lessons needed but not in a preachy manner.In summary,the new Adam Sandler film may not 'click' especially for grown-ups who believe that it makes fun but of immaturity but nevertheless,it still manages to give a few laughs as well as entertain.",10,4,7,31 October 2011

Monty Python and the Holy Grail," An Instant Cult Classic
","Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a British comedy film written and performed by the comedy group Monty Python (Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin), and directed by Gilliam and Jones. It was conceived during the gap between the third and fourth series of their popular BBC television programme Monty Python's Flying Circus.In contrast to the group's first film, And Now for Something Completely Different, a compilation of sketches from the first two television series, Holy Grail was composed of new material, therefore considered the first 'proper' film by the group. It generally parodies the legend of King Arthur's quest to find the Holy Grail.From its opening multi-language titles to the closing arrest of the entire Dark Ages cast by modern-day bobbies, Monty Python and the Holy Grail helped to define 'irreverence' and became an instant cult classic. This time the Pythonites savage the legend of King Arthur, juxtaposing some excellently selected exterior locations with an unending stream of anachronistic one-liners, non sequiturs, and slapstick set pieces. The Knights of the Round Table set off in search of the Holy Grail on foot, as their lackeys make clippety-clop sounds with coconut shells. A plague-ridden community, ringing with the cry of 'bring out your dead,' offers its hale and hearty citizens to the body piles. A wedding of convenience is attacked by Arthur's minions while the pasty-faced groom continually attempts to burst into song. The good guys are nearly thwarted by the dreaded, tree-shaped 'Knights Who Say Ni!' A feisty enemy warrior, bloodily shorn of his arms and legs in the thick of battle, threatens to bite off his opponent's kneecap. A French military officer shouts such taunts as 'I fart in your general direction' and 'I wave my private parts at your aunties.' Rabbits are a particular obsession of the writers this time around, ranging from the huge Trojan Rabbit to the 'killer bunny' that decapitates one of the knights.Grail is as funny as a movie can get, but it is also a tough-minded picture -- as outraged about the human propensity for violence as it is outrageous in its attack on that propensity.Also,there's something about feature films that brings out the best in the Pythons. The occasional indulgence of the TV series is replaced by a more focused approach which wrings every conceivable joke out of a given subject.Finally,it is an instant cult classic as gut-bustingly hilarious as it is blithely ridiculous, Monty Python and the Holy Grail has lost none of its exceedingly silly charm.",10,7,10,5 March 2012
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Empire Strikes Back:The Best Star Wars Film
","The second entry in George Lucas' Star Wars trilogy entitled,Star Wars: Episode V:The Empire Strikes Back finds Luke Skywalker, the green-as- grass hero from the first film,Star Wars:A New Hope,now a seasoned space warrior.This epic space opera film directed by Irvin Kershner. The screenplay, based on a story by George Lucas, was written by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan. Of the six main Star Wars films, it was the second to be released and the fifth in terms of internal chronology.The film is set three years after Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. The Galactic Empire, under the leadership of the villainous Darth Vader, is in pursuit of Luke Skywalker and the rest of the Rebel Alliance. While Vader chases a small band of Luke's friends—Han Solo, Princess Leia Organa, and others—across the galaxy, Luke studies the Force under Jedi Master Yoda. But when Vader captures Luke's friends, Luke must decide whether to complete his training and become a full Jedi Knight or to confront Vader and save his comrades.Luke's Star Wars cohorts Han Solo and Princess Leia are likewise more experienced in the ways and means of battling the insidious Empire, as represented by the brooding Darth Vader. And, of course, 'The Force,' personified by the ghost of Luke's mentor Ben Kenobi, is with them all. Retreating from Vader's minions, Luke ends up, at first, on the Ice Planet Hoth, and then the tropical Dagobah. Here he makes the acquaintance of the gnomish Yoda, whose all- encompassing wisdom comes in handy during the serial-like perils of the rest of the film. Before the film's open-ended climax, we are introduced to the apparently duplicitous Lando Calrissian and are let in on a secret that profoundly affects both Luke and his arch-enemy, Vader.Dark, sinister, but ultimately even more involving than A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back defies viewer expectations and takes the series to heightened emotional levels.A more mature installment than its predecessor,it is loaded with spectacular special effects and efficiently written, this may well be the pinnacle of the saga.It is very strong, cutting back and forth between Luke training with Yoda and Han, Leia, Chewie and C-3P0 fighting the Empire. And it's paced leisurely enough that you get to know the characters a little bit.Aside from that,it is visually more exciting, more artful and meticulous in detail.Obviously,it is a worthy sequel to Star Wars, equal in both technical mastery and characterization which makes it the best Star Wars film.",10,1,1,14 January 2012

This third edition may arrive with low expectations, but it's a pleasant surprise, sending its character barrelling across continents for a zippy, engaging 90-minute adventure.It may lack a little in charm and warmth, but the technical brilliance and decent use of 3D go some way towards compensating for the dimensions that the film otherwise lacks like the development of the characters or situations for comedy gold as the filmmakers instead just crank up the chaos.Overall,it is a dazzlingly colorful and frenetic film that is silly enough for young kids, but boasts enough surprising smarts to engage parents along the way.",9,1,2,10 April 2013

Sin City," Best Comic Adaptation
","Brutal and breathtaking, Sin City is Robert Rodriguez's stunningly realized vision of Frank Miller's pulpy comic books.The film stars an ensemble cast including Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Benicio del Toro, Carla Gugino, Rutger Hauer, Jaime King, Michael Madsen, Brittany Murphy, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, Nick Stahl, Bruce Willis and Elijah Wood, among others.Interweaving multiple story lines from the series' history, this violent crime noir paints the picture of the ultimate town without pity through the eyes of its roughest characters. In the first of three separate but loosely related stories, Marv tries to track down the killers of a woman who ended up dead in his bed.

Finally, an aging cop on his last day on the job rescues a young girl from a kidnapper, but is himself thrown in jail. Years later, he has a chance to save her again.This film is a lot of things, but most of all, it's fun. It may not be for everyone, but everyone should see it once anyway, just to find out if it's for them.Visually groundbreaking and terrifically violent, it brings the dark world of Frank Miller's graphic novel to vivid life.Obviously,it is the most accurate adaptation ever done of a comic book.",9,3,5,1 October 2012

Gangs of New York," Failed Masterpiece
","The violent rise of gangland power in New York City at a time of massive political corruption and the city's evolution into a cultural melting pot set the stage for this lavish historical epic, which director Martin Scorsese finally brought to the screen almost 30 years after he first began to plan the project in this movie,Gangs Of New York.This is a historical film set in the mid-19th century in the Five Points district of New York City.It features Leonardo DiCaprio,Daniel Day-Lewis and Cameron Diaz. It written by Jay Cocks, Steven Zaillian, and Kenneth Lonergan. The film was inspired by Herbert Asbury's 1928 nonfiction book, The Gangs of New York. In 1846, as waves of Irish immigrants poured into the New York neighborhood of Five Points, a number of citizens of British and Dutch heritage who were born in the United States began making an open display of their resentment toward the new arrivals. William Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis), better known as 'Bill the Butcher' for his deadly skill with a knife, bands his fellow 'Native Americans' into a gang to take on the Irish immigrants; the immigrants in turn form a gang of their own, 'The Dead Rabbits,' organized by Priest Vallon. After an especially bloody clash between the Natives and the Rabbits leaves Vallon dead, his son goes missing; the boy ends up in a brutal reform school before returning to the Five Points in 1862 as Amsterdam. Now a strapping adult who has learned how to fight, Amsterdam has come to seek vengeance against Bill the Butcher, whose underworld control of the Five Points through violence and intimidation dovetails with the open corruption of New York politician 'Boss' Tweed. Amsterdam gradually penetrates Bill the Butcher's inner circle, and he soon becomes his trusted assistant. Amsterdam also finds himself falling for Jenny Everdeane, a beautiful but street-smart thief who was once involved with Bill. Amsterdam is learning a great deal from Bill, but before he can turn the tables on the man who killed his father, Amsterdam's true identity is exposed, even though he has concealed it from nearly everyone, including Jenny. It's not a perfect film, by any stretch of the imagination, and when there are cinematic sins they're sins of excess. But Gangs of New York entertains.This film fails to become a masterpiece but nevertheless,it's difficult to dismiss the brilliance of some parts of the film.It may be considered as one of Scorsese's weakest films.It wanted to become a wannabe historical epic but it results into becoming a formulaic revenge saga.As for the cast,only Daniel Day-Lewis' compelling performance as Bill the Butcher remains notable. A failed masterpiece indeed.",10,1,2,9 January 2012
Braveheart," A Spectacular Entertainment
","Braveheart is a historical drama film directed by and starring Mel Gibson. The film was written for the screen and then novelized by Randall Wallace. Gibson portrays William Wallace, a 13th century Scottish warrior who gained recognition when he came to the forefront of the First War of Scottish Independence by opposing King Edward I of England,portrayed by Patrick McGoohan,is also known by the nickname 'Longshanks'.The story begins with young Wallace, whose father and brother have been killed fighting the English, being taken into the custody of his uncle, a nationalist and pre-Renaissance renaissance man. He returns twenty years later, a man educated both in the classics and in the art of war. There he finds his childhood sweetheart Murron, and the two quickly fall in love. There are murmurs of revolt against the English throughout the village, but Wallace remains aloof, wishing simply to tend to his crops and live in peace. However, when his love is killed by English soldiers the day after their secret marriage (held secretly so as to prevent the local English lord from exercising the repulsive right of prima noctae, the privilege of sleeping with the bride on the first night of the marriage), he springs into action and single-handedly slays an entire platoon of foot soldiers. The other villagers join him in destroying the English garrison, and thus begins the revolt against the English in what will eventually become full-fledged war. Wallace eventually leads his fellow Scots in a series of bloody battles that prove a serious threat to English domination and, along the way, has a hushed affair with the Princess of Wales before his imminent demise.Braveheart looks like a true epic -- even if it is both bloody and bloody long.A huge, bloody and sprawling epic,it is the sort of massive vanity piece that would be easy to disparage if it didn't essentially deliver.Mel Gibson, long-time heartthrob of the silver screen, came into his own as a director.As a filmmaker, he lacks the epic gift, but the movie works on a fairly basic level as a hiss-the-English medieval Western.Distractingly violent and historically dodgy, Gibson's directorial work justifies its epic length by delivering enough sweeping action, drama, and romance to match its ambition.One of the most spectacular entertainments in years.",10,1,4,7 March 2012
Joy," Great Performance In A Disappointing Film
","I knew that Academy Award winner Jennifer Lawrence was nominated for an other Academy Award for her performance in this movie Joy,a biographical film that was loosely based on Joy Mangano,a self-made millionaire who created a business empire from different products that she invented.Personally,I was expecting a good movie especially with Academy Award winner Robert De Niro and Academy Award nominees Bradley Cooper and Virginia Madsen are included in the cast together with Academy Award nominee Diane Ladd acting as grandmother and narrator.But I was completely disappointed.Joy tells a story of a woman named Joy,who overcame many odds in order to succeed in business.It starts when she was a young child and has formed big ambitions for her life.Then fast forward many years later,we find her a divorced mother of two children who is barely making through her life.She also has parents who are going through an ugly divorce and an older sister Peggy,who tries to humiliate her endlessly especially in front of her children.When Joy was young,she has an inkling into inventing different products.Her grandmother encourages her to pursue her dreams in business and finds a way to become successful amidst many setbacks that she initially had to overcome.The journey of Joy to becoming a successful woman could have been told in a better way by director/screenwriter David O. Russell.Too bad that we are treated into a clichéd and predictable story that was too simplistic.The theme of having a woman go through different odds like experiencing many odds and setbacks in establishing her empire could have been told with more emotion but too bad the intensity and the passion wasn't even there.The story of Joy's passion of inventing different type of products that aren't considered mainstream isn't there at all.So was her determination.Obviously,there was a lack of depth in the Russell's screenplay.Apparently,Russell did not really discuss the project with Joy Mangano.That is why I felt that he is even at a lost in telling her story.Jennifer Lawrence did well in her performance that she did deserve an Academy Award nomination.Too bad that she was in a disappointing movie and her performance alone could not save it.A total miscast indeed.",7,1,2,3 November 2016

Sam Rockwell stars as the employee Sam Bell, and Kevin Spacey voices his robot companion,GERTY.Robin Chalk,Dominique McElligott,Kaya Scodelario,Benedict Wong and Matt Berry play key supporting roles.It was the feature debut of director Duncan Jones.An astronaut miner extracting the precious moon gas that promises to reverse the Earth's energy crisis nears the end of his three-year contract, and makes an ominous discovery in this psychological sci-fi film. For three long years, Sam Bell has dutifully harvested Helium 3 for Lunar, a company that claims it holds the key to solving humankind's energy crisis. As Sam's contract comes to an end, the lonely astronaut looks forward to returning to his wife and daughter down on Earth, where he will retire early and attempt to make up for lost time. His work on the Selene moon base has been enlightening wherein the solitude helping him to reflect on the past and overcome some serious anger issues but the isolation is starting to make Sam uneasy. With only two weeks to go before he begins his journey back to Earth, Sam starts feeling strange: he's having inexplicable visions, and hearing impossible sounds. Then, when a routine extraction goes horribly awry, it becomes apparent that Lunar hasn't been entirely straightforward with Sam about their plans for replacing him. The new recruit seems strangely familiar, and before Sam returns to Earth, he will grapple with the realization that the life he has created may not be entirely his own. Up there, hundreds of thousands of miles from home,it appears that Sam's contract isn't the only thing about to expire.Science fiction can encompass many genres such as suspense, horror, action-adventure, romance, even comedy but this movie doesn't fit neatly into any of them. This smart, provocative film has no aliens or cool spaceships, and the effects aren't all that special instead, the material is character- and story-driven, centering on an excellent, multi-layered performance by Sam Rockwell.But overall,it is a compelling work of science-fiction.",10,3,9,3 October 2012

Clarence is celebrating his birthday in just such a manner when he meets a beautiful girl named Alabama, and it's love at first sight for both of them. Clarence's enthusiasm isn't dampened much when he discovers Alabama is actually a prostitute who was paid by his boss to bump into him; she's only been in the business for a few days, and is more than eager to give up streetwalking to be with Clarence. However, Alabama is certain her pimp, Drexl, will not be happy; he's an ill-mannered sort with mob connections and a fondness for violence. Chivalrous Clarence offers to break the news to Drexl and collect her belongings, but he doesn't tell her he also plans to kill Drexl while he's there; a melee breaks out that leaves Drexl and his henchmen dead. Clarence grabs a suitcase that he thinks contains Alabama's clothes, but he discovers it instead holds five million dollars' worth of cocaine. The couple hits the road for California, planning to sell the dope and enjoy the good life in South America with the proceeds, but soon a group of very unhappy underworld characters are after them, as well as the police.Based on an early script from Tarantino, Tony Scott's wild movie is suitable for youth of the 1990s for it is a gutsy, violent and satisfying.

The Breakfast Club," Greatly Explores Inner Lives Of Teenagers
","Whenever I hear the song,'Don't You Forget About Me' by Simple Minds,it only reminds me on the 80's teen-age classic film,The Breakfast Club - one of the best films ever made about High School students.I personally feel that John Hughes once again delivers upon making this film.Breakfast Club is a film written and directed by John Hughes. The storyline follows five teenagers that represent different stereotypes namely: the princess;the jock;the criminal;the brain; and the basket case as they spend a Saturday in detention together and come to realize that they are all deeper than their respective personalities and nature.The movie stars Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estevez,Judd Nelson,Anthony Michael Hall and Ally Sheedy. The plot follows five students at Shermer High School in the fictitious Chicago suburb of Shermer, Illinois as they report for Saturday detention on March 24, 1984. While not complete strangers, the five teenagers are each from a different clique or social group.They are Allison Reynolds,Andrew Clark,John Bender,Brian Johnson, and Claire Standish - who seem to have nothing in common at first, come together at the high school library, where they are harangued and ordered not to speak or move from their seats by the antagonistic principal,Richard Vernon.The students pass the hours in a variety of ways. Gradually they open up to each other and reveal their inner secrets.At the end of the day, the students bond together when faced with the villainous principal ,and they realize that they have more in common than they may think, including a contempt for adult society.The Breakfast Club is definitely a warm, insightful, and very funny look into the inner lives of teenagers.Equal parts are funny, smart and sincere.It takes a look a little deeper into the teenage psyche and came back with something more challenging like how to grow up from their fears and anxieties in life. In the end,anyone who happens to be High School or have been in High School could relate to the issues faced by the people involved.The performances of the movie were great especially that of Ally Sheedy as the basket case and Molly Ringwald as the princess.Aside from that,the direction of Hughes is superb that he definitely proves a point that he is the best director when it comes to teen films.And just like what I said,the song attached to the film 'Don't You Forget About Me' by Simple Minds remains a classic song.In the end,this is one great teen movie that even adults would appreciate.",10,4,6,26 October 2011
Gladiator," A Sword-And-Sandal Epic In Modern Hollywood
","Gladiator is a historical epic film directed by Ridley Scott, starring Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Ralf Möller, Oliver Reed, Djimon Hounsou, Derek Jacobi, John Shrapnel and Richard Harris.

Reduced to slavery, Maximus rises through the ranks of the gladiatorial arena to avenge the murder of his family and his Emperor.A man robbed of his name and his dignity strives to win them back, and gain the freedom of his people, in this epic historical drama from director Ridley Scott.

Renamed Spaniard and forced to become a gladiator, Maximus must battle to the death with other men for the amusement of paying audiences. His battle skills serve him well, and he becomes one of the most famous and admired men to fight in the Colosseum. Determined to avenge himself against the man who took away his freedom and laid waste to his family, Maximus believes that he can use his fame and skill in the ring to avenge the loss of his family and former glory.

Ridley Scott and an excellent cast successfully convey the intensity of Roman gladiatorial combat as well as the political intrigue brewing beneath.Though the digital effects lack the weight and conviction of their equivalents in old Cecil B. De Mille movies,Scott's sword-and- sandal epic has some of the intensity of old Hollywood in terms of storytelling, spectacle, and violence.",10,1,3,25 February 2012
Donnie Darko," No Wonder It Is A Cult Classic
","Donnie Darko is a science fiction psychological thriller that stars Jake Gyllenhaal in the title role together with Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze, Noah Wyle, Jena Malone, and Mary McDonnell. It depicts the adventures of the title character as he seeks the meaning and significance behind his troubling Doomsday-related visions.It was written and directed by Richard Kelly. Donnie is a bright and charming high-school student who also has a dark and willfully eccentric side as he does little to mask his contempt for many of his peers and enjoys challenging the authority of the adults around him.He also visited on occasion by Frank, a monstrous six-foot rabbit that only he can see who often urges him to perform dangerous and destructive pranks. Late one night, Frank leads him out of his home to inform him that the world will come to an end in less than a month. Later, the engine of a jet aircraft comes crashing through the ceiling of his room, making him think there might be something to Frank's prophesies after all. The rest of Donnie's world is only marginally less bizarre, as he finds himself dealing with his confused parents, his sister, his perplexed analyst, a rebellious English teacher, a sleazy self-help expert and the new girl at school who is attracted by Donnie's quirks.This film is a daring, original vision, packed with jarring ideas and intelligence and featuring a remarkable performance from Jake Gyllenhaal.Also,it is an unclassifiable but stunningly original film obliterates the walls between teen comedy, science fiction, family drama, horror, and cultural satire but it remains wildly entertaining throughout. The debut feature of writer-director Richard Kelly is a shattering, hypnotic work that sets its own terms and gambles-- rightfully so, as it turns out that a viewer will stay aboard for the full ride.No wonder it has become a cult classic.",10,1,3,25 September 2012

Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade:The Best Indiana Jones Movie
","The third installment in the widely beloved Spielberg/Lucas Indiana Jones saga begins with an introduction to a younger Indy, who, through a fast-paced prologue, gives the audience insight into the roots of his taste for adventure, fear of snakes, and dogged determination to take historical artifacts out of the hands of bad guys and into the museums in which they belong.Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is an adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg, from a story co-written by executive producer George Lucas. It is the third film in the Indiana Jones franchise. Harrison Ford reprises the title role and Sean Connery plays Indiana's father, Henry Jones, Sr. Alison Doody, Denholm Elliott, Julian Glover, River Phoenix, and John Rhys-Davies also have featured roles.After the mixed reaction to the dark Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Spielberg chose to compensate by completing the trilogy with a film lighter in tone.In the film, set largely in 1938, Indiana searches for his father, a Holy Grail scholar, who has been kidnapped by Nazis.A grown-up Indy reveals himself shortly afterward in a familiar classroom scene, teaching archeology to a disproportionate number of starry-eyed female college students in 1938. Once again, however, Mr. Jones is drawn away from his day job after an art collector approaches him with a proposition to find the much sought after Holy Grail. Circumstances reveal that there was another avid archaeologist in search of the famed cup -- Indiana Jones' father, Dr. Henry Jones -- who had recently disappeared during his efforts. The junior and senior members of the Jones family find themselves in a series of tough situations in locales ranging from Venice to the most treacherous spots in the Middle East. Complicating the situation further is the presence of Elsa, a beautiful and intelligent woman with one fatal flaw: she's an undercover Nazi agent. Of the three Jones films, The Last Crusade may well become the sentimental favorite.It captures some of the sense of fun that infused the first movie as it was lighter and more comedic than its predecessor (The Temple Of Doom),Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade returns the series to the brisk serial adventure of Raiders while using the addition of Sean Connery to up the comedic ante and provide a father and son dynamic.The eventual arrival of towering screen presence Sean Connery as Dr. Henry Jones, Sr. alongside Harrison Ford as Dr. Henry Jones, Jr. allows for what may be adventure cinema's most potent pairing. Producer/writer George Lucas and director Steven Spielberg will treat movie fans to an Indiana Jones adventure, and it's pretty obvious they were determined to send Indy riding off into the sunset in style.In the end,it's impossible to deny the film's status as the very best of the Indiana Jones franchise.",10,2,3,14 January 2012
Back to the Future," A Time-travel Adventure Film With An Unforgettable Spirit
","Back to the Future is a science-fiction adventure film. It was directed by Robert Zemeckis, written by Zemeckis and Bob Gale, produced by Steven Spielberg, and starred Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover and Thomas F. Wilson. The film tells the story of Marty McFly, a teenager who is accidentally sent back in time from 1985 to 1955. He meets his future-parents in high school and accidentally attracts his future mother's romantic interest. Marty must repair the damage to history by causing his parents-to-be to fall in love, and with the help of scientist Dr. Emmett 'Doc' Brown, he must find a way to return to 1985.Contemporary high schooler Marty McFly doesn't have the most pleasant of lives. Browbeaten by his principal at school, Marty must also endure the acrimonious relationship between his nerdy father and his lovely mother (Lea Thompson), who in turn suffer the bullying of middle-aged jerk Biff (Thomas F. Wilson), Marty's dad's supervisor. The one balm in Marty's life is his friendship with eccentric scientist Doc, who at present is working on a time machine. Accidentally zapped back into the 1950s, Marty inadvertently interferes with the budding romance of his now- teen-aged parents. Our hero must now reunite his parents-to-be, lest he cease to exist in the 1980s. It won't be easy, especially with the loutish Biff, now also a teenager, complicating matters. Beyond its dazzling special effects, the best element of Back to the Future is the performance of Michael J. Fox, who finds himself in the quagmire of surviving the white-bread 1950s with a hip 1980s mindset.Back to the Future cemented the box-office bankability of both Fox and the film's director, Robert Zemeckis, who went on to helm two equally exhilarating sequels. Performances by the earnest Fox, the lunatic Lloyd, the deceptively passionate Lea Thompson, and, particularly, the bumbling-to-confident Glover, who runs away with the picture, merrily keep the ship sailing.While Zemeckis is able both to keep the story moving and to keep it from going too far. He handles Back to the Future with the kind of inventiveness that indicates he will be spinning funny, whimsical tall tales for a long time to come.Inventive, funny, and breathlessly constructed, it is rousing a time-travel adventure with an unforgettable spirit.",10,1,1,2 March 2012

","The Great Gatsby is a 3D film adaptation the 1925 novel of the same name that stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton, and Elizabeth Debicki.It follows the life and times of millionaire Jay Gatsby and his neighbor Nick Carraway, who recounts his encounter with Gatsby at the height of the 1920's.This serves as a tribute to F. Scott Fitzgerald on the 116th anniversary of his birth and the 1925 novel of the same name.It was co-written and directed by Baz Luhrmann.It is the spring of 1922, an era of loosening morals, glittering jazz, bootleg kings, and sky-rocketing stocks. Chasing his own American Dream, Nick lands next door to a mysterious, party-giving millionaire, Jay Gatsby and across the bay from his cousin,Daisy and her philandering, blue-blooded husband, Tom Buchanan. As Nick bears witness to the captivating world of the rich,he writes a tale that consists of impossible love, incorruptible dreams and tragedy that similar to our own struggles in the present.This film is definitely a visually great.It won two Oscars for best production design and best costume design.Too bad that the viewer feels that too much effort was placed in it rather than Fitzgerald's story itself.Also,we get lost in following the material especially when we are continuously amazed with the visual effects of the movie that is so excessive just like the parties hosted by Gatsby himself. Too bad the this great story was presented in a boring and dull manner that one does not hold interest in the tales and themes it is trying to convey.In the end,lessons that could have been learned gets lost somewhere in this film.As for the performances,there is nothing really worthy to be mentioned despite of the talented cast involved in it.Too bad that it is only a minor improvement of the Robert Redford and Mia Farrow-starrer of the 1974 The Great Gatsby.But nevertheless,this film is definitely what Jay Gatsby would say if he were alive today,'A visual splendor,old sport!!!'",8,1,3,12 March 2014

Sully," An Underwhelming Hanks-Eastwood Film
","Well,I was excited to see this film after knowing that Tom Hanks will be the lead star and Clint Eastwood is going to direct the film.But then I watched it.I could not believe what I just saw. It was purely underwhelming.Before I explain further,let me first describe what 'Sully' is all about.It was January 15,2009.The US Airways Flight 1549 piloted by Captain Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger and First Officer Jeff Skiles are coming from LaGuardia Airport towards Charlotte Douglas International Airport.But three minutes into the flight when the plane was at an altitude of 2,800 feet hit a flock of birds that disabled both engines of the plane.Without engine power and realizing that there are no airports around,Captain Sully decided to land the plane on Hudson River.Everyone hails the Captain as a hero.But the National Transportation Safety Board claims that Sully should have landed the plane at a nearby airport instead of putting the plane on the river.Now Sully must defend what he did at the Safety Board that he indeed acted correctly.The End.And knowing Hollywood being penchant for happy endings,the viewer would likely know what is going to happen.They know that Sully will definitely end as a hero and acted correctly or did movie would not have been made.The story was simple as that.In fact,the movie was short for it lasted only 90 minutes.It could have been interesting but it wasn't.The film was totally underwhelming as the viewer would probably not really get involved in Hanks' character nor the tension of the story as everything just happened without emotion.That includes the landing of the plane and the scenes at the Safety Board when Sully and Skiles were defending themselves.What saved it from disaster is definitely both Hanks and Eastwood.Tom Hanks provided a good performance as Sully.Eastwood's direction was decent.But it wasn't enough to have an interesting story.Overall,the movie just went to the motions of telling the story as it lacks tension,characterization and emotion.Truly underwhelming.",7,1,1,19 July 2017
Princess Mononoke," A Landmark Japanese Anime
","Princess Mononoke is an epic Japanese animated historical fantasy feature film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki of Studio Ghibli. 'Mononoke' is not a name, but a general term in the Japanese language for a spirit or monster.Directed by renowned animator Hayao Miyazaki, this anime has broken a number of box office records in its native Japan. Essentially a statement on the ecological devastation brought on by human advancement, the story follows the battle between Princess Mononoke and a mining village.Princess Mononoke is a period drama set specifically in the late Muromachi period of Japan but with numerous fantastical elements. The story concentrates on involvement of the outsider Ashitaka in the struggle between the supernatural guardians of a forest and the humans of the Iron Town who consume its resources. There can be no clear victory, and the hope is that relationship between humans and nature can be cyclical.Miyazaki's exceedingly imaginative, beautifully realized animated epic adventure has been adapted into English with tact and talent.The imagery, ranging from sublime mountain-smashing power to firefly delicacy (individual waterdrops splashing on a rock) is exuberant and intoxicating.Even when animals speak, lip sync is avoided; they seem to be communicating almost telepathically, and one seldom feels that they're contradicting their animal natures.With its epic story and breathtaking visuals, Princess Mononoke is a landmark in the world of animation.",10,1,3,7 March 2012

In one of the biggest achievements in boxing history, he defeats the seemingly invincible opponent to become the heavyweight champion of the world.This film is definitely ranks among the top boxing films ever made such as:Raging Bull, Million Dollar Baby and the Rocky movies.But compared to the movies mentioned previously,Cinderella Man is more powerful emotionally especially as an underdog story particularly.The Braddock- Baer fight was shot with sheer authenticity proves this point.Russell Crowe's portrayal makes Braddock fascinating and we are truly absorbed with the character that he plays and the situation that he was in during the hard times he experienced during The Great Depression and during his fight at the conclusion of the film.Overall,this is one great unforgettable and powerful underdog picture.",10,1,1,6 August 2013

","Steven Spielberg's phenomenally successful sci-fi adventure thriller is graced by state-of-the-art special effects from the team of Stan Winston, Phil Tippett and Michael Lantieri from George Lucas's Industrial Light & Magic in this movie,Jurassic Park.It is based on the novel of the same title by Michael Crichton and it stars Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Ariana Richards, Joseph Mazzello, Martin Ferrero and Bob Peck. The story centers on the fictional Isla Nublar near Costa Rica in the Central American Pacific Coast, where a billionaire philanthropist and a small team of genetic scientists have created an amusement park of cloned dinosaurs.The screenplay follows Dr. Alan Grant and Dr. Ellie Sattler,two dinosaur experts as they are invited by eccentric millionaire John Hammond to preview his new amusement park on an island off Costa Rica. By cloning DNA harvested from pre-historic insects, Hammond has been able to create living dinosaurs for his new Jurassic Park, an immense animal preserve housing real brachiosaurs, dilophosaurs, triceratops, velociraptors, and a Tyrannosaur Rex. Accompanied by cynical scientist Ian Malcolm, who is obsessed with chaos theory, and Hammond's two grandchildren, they are sent on a tour through Hammond's new resort in computer controlled touring cars. But as a tropical storm hits the island, knocking out the power supply, and an unscrupulous employee sabotages the system so that he can smuggle dinosaur embryos out of the park, the dinosaurs start to rage out of control. Grant then has to bring Hammond's grandchildren back to safety as the group is pursued by the gigantic man-eating beasts.Jurassic Park remains an incredible viewing experience and it never ceases to be entertaining. It's not an entirely faithful adaptation of Michael Crichton's popular novel, but the creative liberties it takes prove enormously ingenious.There is a lot of good things to say about it like the performances are top notch, the score is brilliant, and the special effects still hold up at present times in what is easily one of Steven Spielberg's best sequences of sustained awe and sheer terror since Jaws.",10,4,4,30 September 2012

To do so, he arranges for the internal emergency measure, Operation: Valkyrie, to be revised to enable his fellows to seize control of Berlin after the Hitler's assassination. However,bad luck and human failings went against von Stauffenberg's group as it failed to kill the Fuhrer. This historical movie was full of suspense from beginning to end.Also,Tom Cruise provided an intense performance to show that not all Germans were of support of Hitler's ways. He definitely was full of honesty in the portrayal of von Stauffenberg.The rest of the cast were also commendable as well particularly Terence Stamp as Ludwig Beck; Kenneth Branagh as Major-General Henning von Tresckow; and Tom Wilkinson as the despicable General Friedrich Fromm.This film gives you an appreciation of the group of Germans who sacrificed their lives to stop Hitler's evil deeds and support a moral and sacred German government.Just as von Stauffenberg shouted before being shot by the firing squad after being captured after their failed plot,'Long live sacred Germany!!!'

","All the President's Men is a political thriller film based on the 1974 non-fiction book of the same name by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, the two journalists investigating the Watergate scandal for The Washington Post. The film featured Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman as Woodward and Bernstein, respectively together with Jason Robards,Jack Warden,Hal Holbrook,Jane Alexander and Martin Balsam. It was written by William Goldman, and directed by Alan J. Pakula.In the story,while researching a story about a botched 1972 burglary of Democratic Party headquarters at the Watergate apartment complex, green Washington Post reporters/rivals Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein stumble on a possible connection between the burglars and a White House staffer. With the circumspect approval of executive editor Ben Bradlee, the pair digs deeper. Aided by a guilt-ridden turncoat bookkeeper and the vital if cryptic guidance of Woodward's mystery source, Deep Throat ,Woodward and Bernstein 'follow the money' all the way to the top of the Nixon administration. Despite Deep Throat's warnings that their lives are in danger, and the reluctance of older Post editors, Woodward and Bernstein are determined to get out the story of the crime and its presidential cover-up. Once Bradlee is convinced, the final teletype impassively taps out the historically explosive results. This Redford-Hoffman collaboration is one of the best political thrillers ever made.It could even be classic for many others.It was a taut, solidly acted according to the benefits of a free press and the dangers of unchecked power, made all the more effective by its origins in real-life events.Pakula's superb direction makes the film remarkably intelligent, working both as an effective thriller and as a virtually abstract charting of the dark corridors of corruption and power.Aside from that,the cast had a brilliant performance,no matter show short,for every line of characters.Finally,it is a finer political film you will not find. It should be declared a national treasure.",10,3,4,8 December 2011

Rajiv Joseph and Scott Rothman wrote the screenplay and Ivan Reitman directed the film.The movie was obviously in the same sports genre of Moneyball wherein most of the action takes place inside the front office instead inside the football stadium.Too supplant that lack of action,Kevin Costner provides a great performance as Weaver as he uses both his talent and charisma to provide the necessary character changes and transformation needed as he deals with crucial decisions needed by Browns as well as the different aspects of his personal life.Sports fans looking for intense and exciting football action will definitely be disappointed for the lack of it.While the film could be somewhat slow especially in the first half,it manages to provide excitement in the end when Weaver makes the decision in the end and how the team benefited from it.One could even classify the film somewhat corny and definitely far from being realistic from the NFL perspective.But Costner's performance makes the necessary effort to lift it from being an average film to a movie with a better-than-average rating.",8,1,2,11 March 2015

The Soloist," Great Performances But Lacking Narrative Focus
","Academy Award-nominated director Joe Wright teams with screenwriter Susannah Grant to tell the true-life story of Nathaniel Ayers, a former cello prodigy whose bouts with schizophrenia landed him on the streets after two years of schooling at Julliard in this movie entitled,The Soloist.It features Jamie Foxx,Robert Downey, Jr. and Catherine Keener. Foxx portrays Ayers, who is considered a cello prodigy, and Downey portrays Lopez, a Los Angeles Times columnist who discovers Ayers and writes about him in the newspaper.Steve Lopez is a disenchanted journalist stuck in a dead-end job. His marriage to a fellow journalist having recently come to an end, Steve is wandering through Los Angeles' Skid Row when he notices a bedraggled figure playing a two-stringed violin. The figure in question is Ayers, a man whose promising career in music was cut short due to a debilitating bout with mental illness. The more Lopez learns about Ayers, the greater his respect grows for the troubled soul. Later, as Lopez embarks on a quixotic quest to help Ayers pull his life together and launch a career in music, he gradually comes to realize that it is not Ayers whose life is being transformed, but his own.Though it features strong performances by its lead players, a lack of narrative focus prevents the movie from hitting its mark.In the hands of a director more suited to the material,it might have been a deeply moving experience as we know something important is being played out before us and it lacks power; and there are times when it hits home with force. It definitely has its moments but too heavy-handed and predictable.The subject matter is a little too easy to overdo for that, but it is pretty good, thanks to a pair of fine performances from Foxx and Downey.",9,1,1,16 October 2012
Rock Star," A RomCom At A Rock And Roll Setting
","Rock Star is a musical drama that tells the story of Chris 'Izzy' Cole,a tribute band singer that replaced the lead vocalist of his favorite band,Steel Dragon.It stars Mark Wahlberg and Jennifer Aniston. John Stockwell wrote the story and Stephen Herek directed the film.Izzy is a wannabe rock star.He works as a copy machine repairman at day and is the lead vocalist of Blood Pollution,a tribute band that imitates the hugely popular Steel Dragon.She is supported by Emily,who is his girlfriend and business manager of the band.One day,there members of the band got into an argument that led to the dismissal of Chris from the group.However,he later got a call from Steel Dragon to audition.After the rehearsal with them,Chris got offered to join the group as their new lead vocalist.The band went on to be successful with him but later he realized that there is more to life than being in the limelight. I got into the film after reading the story of Journey's new vocalist,Arnel Pineda.His story is definitely similar to the movie although it happened after 7 years the movie was released.It was synonymous in the sense that a once Journey cover singer Arnel got to become Journey's frontman. It was interesting to note though that the movie was inspired from Judas Priest but what happened was even life imitated art in history of Journey that is why I was entertained with the movie.As a whole though,I felt that the movie just provided us a glimpse on the world of rock and roll bands as it fell into cliché after cliché of a typical romantic comedy that provides both humor and life lessons as the conclusion comes near.In short,there was really nothing original and refreshing about it expect probably the fact that we have story on a rock and roll setting.",8,1,1,28 June 2014

Up in the Air," Up In The Air Delivers
","Up In The Air is a comedy/drama film that stars George Clooney,Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick.It is a story about a corporate 'downsizer' Ryan Bingham and his travels. The film follows his isolated life and philosophies along with the people he meets along the way.It was directed by Jason Reitman and co-written by Reitman and Sheldon Turner based on the novel of the title that was written by Walter Kirn.Ryan Bingham (Clooney)makes his living personally handing out pink slips -- he's the top hatchet man at a company that other companies hire when they are downsizing. And since business is booming, his job keeps him on the go constantly. He flies all across the country, staying in a series of nice hotels. And although this itinerant lifestyle prevents him from having any kind of stable, regular life, this doesn't bother him in the slightest -- he's thrilled to be a boy in a traveling bubble. During one particular layover, he strikes up a conversation with Alex Goran (Farmiga), a fellow savvy traveler. They bond over the ins and outs of various airlines and hotels, and quickly fall into bed. By morning, they are figuring out when their schedules will allow them to meet up again, even though they both make it clear that there are no strings attached. When Ryan arrives back in the home office, he meets no-nonsense career- oriented twenty-something Natalie Keener (Kendrick), a fast-rising up- and-comer who wants to change the company's practices and save millions by having the staff fire people remotely via web cams. Furious at the thought of losing a lifestyle he's grown quite comfortable with, he convinces his boss to let him take Natalie on a few trips so that she can learn what it's really like to fire someone.George Clooney is thoroughly likable as the amusingly callous Ray.Watching him at the heart-breaking job of terminating folk is fun and gives the film its heart.The other women - Farmiga and Kendrick - also provide memorable performances.What makes it a wonderful film is the fact that it succeeds because it doesn't take itself that seriously and it shows a moment of fundamental change in a man's life that every viewer could probably relate to as he/she have lost a job which happens to be a common thing especially with the United States experiencing an economic downturn.Overall,the movie delivers and a classic in the making.",10,1,2,11 September 2012

The Island," A Futuristic Thriller About Cloning And Immortality
","The Island is a science fiction/thriller film that stars Ewan McGregor and Scarlett. Steve Buscemi, Djimon Hounsou, Michael Clarke Duncan and Sean Bean co-stars in key supporting roles.It was directed by Michael Bay.Lincoln Six Echo lives in a confined indoor community after ongoing abuse of the Earth has rendered most of the planet uninhabitable. One of the only places in the outside world still capable of sustaining life is an idyllic island where citizens are chosen to live through a lottery. Or at least that's what Lincoln and his fellow citizens are taught to believe; the truth is that Lincoln, like everyone he knows, is actually a clone who is kept under wraps to provide needed organs when the person who supplied his or her DNA falls ill. When he becomes aware that his existence is a fraud, Lincoln escapes to the outside world with a fellow clone, Jordan Two Delta, though the powers that be are determined to see that no one gets away alive.The film becomes just another Michael Bay action extravaganza where explosions and chases matter more than characters, dialogue, or plot.With elaborate chase scenes and a high-tech feast of CGI to dazzle the eye, it recycles much of the plot from borrowing elements from other movies such as Logan's Run, Gattaca and Minority Report, and while it's not as smartly conceived as those earlier films, there's no denying that, in many ways, it's Bay's best film to date as it was a stunning futuristic thriller about cloning and immortality.",8,1,2,27 September 2012
