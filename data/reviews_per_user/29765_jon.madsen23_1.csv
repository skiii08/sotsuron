Ali," A good emotional movie but not informative
",Will Smith is the highlight of this movie.  He did a terrific job being Ali. If you don't know the Ali story this movie was hard to understand.  I for one went with the idea it would be a bio on his life.  But it didn't explain much of what was going on.  I was disappointed in the boxing scenes.  It was a good movie for the most part but not great.  They had a great story but didn't develop it.,Null,0,0,5 March 2002
