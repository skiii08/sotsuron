Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lucas?
","well i went to see the 3-d version of this last night just so i could see the 2 parts that i like.was it worth it?nope!this is so CRAPPY in so many ways were should i start.lets start with Jake Lloyd,that kids performance was one the worst ever.the god awful dialog did not help him much, but that kid is hard to watch.everybody says Lucas does not how to get what he wants out of his actors.but one of his best friends is Spielberg,make a call for funk sakes.however Lloyd was not alone in the poor acting category.just about everybody was bad with maybe an exception going to Watt. one of the things that made the first movies so effective is that they had heart .these new movies feel like there six feet under from the start.you care for absolutely nothing that is going on,or anybody.and one of the many reason for this is you don't put comedy in the middle of a life or death situation.it kills all the emotion.just imagine the three stooges running up the beach in saving private Ryan.and why does Lucas think that we want to hear the same dialog from the earlier films over and over?'that crap drives me nuts' said the pirate with steering wheel between his legs.jeez! i could go on and on, and i think i will. the 3-d,what 3-d it was barely noticeable.",1,3,8,12 February 2012
