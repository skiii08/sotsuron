Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Yeah, yeah
","George Lucas reminds me of a classical molesting father. 22 years ago, he had a lot of children, and he gave them the dream, something they always wanted, fairy tale called 'Star Wars'. And then, he helped major studio companies to rape this kids with incredible amount of garbage that poured on the screen, while he himself always stayed on a distance from it. Now, 22 years later, his naive children still want to believe their father loves them. They are awaiting for new trilogy as little kids for the affection. They didn't notice that their father raped them again, this time himself, with Jar Jar Binks and little Jake Lloyd and whatever it is he put in the movie. They are in such a denial, that while some of them are so blind they pretend they loved the movie, others aren't dumb enough to do so, they pretend that this was a mistake, and next films are gonna correct it. Epsiode one was surrounded by so much hype, it's practically impossible to distinguish the movie itself. It's probably the average film, not too bad, not too good. The only question is, when exactly millions of funs will understand how violated they are and say good bye to this dream turned nightmare. *1/2",Null,0,1,21 February 2000
Mulholland Drive," It's not just the structure.
","Everybody's lying. You shouldn't analyze a film to know whether it's good or not. Analyzing wouldn't make it worse, you will just come to the same conclusion. Only thing that matters, is how film feels, not necessarily right after you saw it, but in general. Take 'Mulholland Drive'. The film might seem pretty primitive. Lynch takes the story of the naive actress's broken dreams in Hollywood, and blows it up, making it surreal and reminiscent of Hollywood noir. Is it easy to do? Theoretically speaking, yes, it is. But you can feel that movie is really good, because you can feel that for Lynch it's not just an exercise in twisting and turning rules of the narrative. (Lost Highway was the exercise, but exercise so splendid, even if it was cold and artificial, it still was mesmerizing). Lynch's strong points here are, first of all, is that he shows us both versions of what happened. None of the parts of the film are dread, no matter what hundreds of reviewers been saying. They are like two mirrors that were put together under weird angle. Second of all, even though you can point out similarities between two parts, they are totally different. Everytime you trying to put all the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle together, they don't fit. And that's what films supposed to do anyway. I anticipate, in the near future, Mulholland Drive will suffer major throwback. It's too perfect, it's getting too much acclaim, naturally people will call it overrated. They will refer to the loose ends of where TV pilot ends and the film begins, they will say that 'Club Silencio' is blue colored version of Black Lodge. Most of all, they will say, that the moral of the film is an obvious cliche. To all this, I can say: First of all, the only way to appreciate Lynch's film, is to have faith in him completely, to trust that he really means what he says, and in Mulholland Drive I am willing to trust him more than ever, because I do feel the love he put in every scene, even what might've seem the exploitative lesbian scene. I believe every single scene in this film. Second of all, getting back to beginning of my review, it feels right, and no amount of writing about film can change it.",10,1,1,14 December 2001
Annie Hall," Little epic
","Reviewing Fellini's 'Casanova', Pauline Kael wrote, that it's impossible for a director to make a successful epic about himself. With 'Annie Hall', Allen didn't just become first director to accomplish that, he was the first successful case of a person to just stand before camera, and tell the world about himself. Allen makes what other directors were afraid of: he shows all of his cards, he hides nothing. His message is: 'Here I am, a little man, telling you about my views on everything from sex to politics. Some of them are trivial, some original, but I don't care--take it or leave it'. 'Annie Hall' could be so incredibly bad, but it wasn't. It is a masterpiece not in a sense that it's a very good film, it's rather one of those cases where you accept it for what it is.It's really simple, yes, but like with all Allen's films, it's simplicity borders with perfection. It's obvious that Allen was set to make a 'serious' movie, but, like many times after, didn't. Instead, we got one of the funniest and honest films ever made. Maybe word masterpiece shouldn't be applied to 'Annie Hall', but in his own half-baked way, Allen made the perfect self-portrait.",10,3,7,12 December 1999
Once Upon a Time in America," Best film of the 80s
","If this film wasn't so long, it wouldn't be watchable. Simple story about love, death, betrayal, and redemption, has unmistakeable 70s feel, which was very rare in terrible years of 1980s for a film. Leone gives us something script doesn't: he makes it so slow paced, even simple scenes have some hidden meaning in them, we are allowed to  meditate over characters' routine actions, which makes the most trivial details unusual and enigmatic. The film is nostalgic by the time that never existed. Even if it didn't show anything we haven't seen before, and probably events in the movie couldn't inspire philosophical interpretation, thanks to Leone, after watching 'Once Upon a Time in America' we have a feeling that we just witnessed something huge and wonderful, even though we are not sure what exactly.",9,2,4,6 December 1999
