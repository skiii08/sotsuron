Blade Runner 2049," A visually stunning lullaby
","I loved the airy mystery and atmosphere the movie conveys throughout, especially in the beginning. generally its slow-paced It felt somewhat lethargic - maybe a too much that i ended up dozing in and out of sleep; after an hour, I was finally out. 
there are beautiful elements of colours, visual effects, and especially the cinematography and locations, at random stops in the movie, but DAMN this drags.
very good,a but not something id watch any time soon without a pack of energy drinks.",6,3,5,25 September 2018
