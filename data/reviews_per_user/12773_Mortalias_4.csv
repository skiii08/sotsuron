Whip It," Fantastic directoral debut
","Drew Barrymore is well known for her quirky acting and distinct personality. But now movie goers across the country will begin seeing her in a new light- director.'Whip It,' which stars Ellen Page (Juno), Marcia Harden, and several other notable actors/actresses is a fun filled, action packed, emotional film that forces you to give an old fashioned thumbs up as you leave.Page is fantastic in her role, perfectly capturing the rebellious, curious character of Bliss Cavendar. Her innocent face leaves you rooting for her while at the same time wondering if her decisions are ultimately right. Harden again plays her role flawlessly, down to her own hidden dreams disguised under her thick shell.Unlike most 'rise to the top' movies, Whip It is believable. It seems real at all times. It feels as though all of us at one point in our lives were like Bliss, longing to live a different life.If you want a great night at the movies, if you want a solid movie with enjoyable memories, and if you want to answer that question of 'I wonder how Drew Barrymore would be as a director,' go see Whip It. You'll be pleasantly surprised.",8,65,83,4 October 2009
Inglourious Basterds," An enthralling, unique experience
","Having not seen a Tarantino film in a while, part of me was nervous how his newest flick would fare, while part of me was excited for what it could become.From the beginning it's very clear the film is presented in a unique fashion. The first characters we see are both mysterious yet incredibly intriguing. In fact, for a movie that predominately consists of foreign dialogue, neither the constant need to read subtitles or the lasting task of listening to ongoing conversations proves to be boring. Every character is rich in personality, even if their story is basic and simple.Pitt offers a humorous performance, yet underneath his southern accent and witty aura is the impression of a dedicated man, even if it's never mentioned. Mélanie Laurent, although seeing her for the first time, gives a superb performance.The style is different, the presentation is classic Tarantino, the plot is well constructed, and the over-the-top actions and dialogue make this 'revenge' flick one of Tarantino's finest. A must see for anyone who appreciates a great night out at the movies.",9,2,8,24 August 2009
Downfall," Incredible look into Hitler's final days
","Having heard many positive reviews of 'The Downfall,' I expected a unique and interesting film when I watched the opening scenes. By the time the credits began to roll, I was taken aback by how incredible it turned out to be.To begin, Bruno Ganz as Adolf Hitler absolutely makes this film what it is. At certain times throughout the film I had forgotten that an actor was playing him, and actually thought I was watching the real person. His demeanor, personality shifts, loud outbursts, even facial expressions are so dead on it's incredible. In fact, the entire cast as a whole delivers an extraordinary performance. It is clear that careful thought went into the selection of actors/actresses.The film tells the grim story of Hitler and his right-hand men during the last days of his life. We see a man grow increasingly insane as he refuses to accept the ultimate end of his lifetime goal. We also see the differences in the characters around him, some believing in his ideas until death, some showing the slightest ounce of disbelief in the world around them. It offers an extraordinary look into the past, a first hand look into the mind of Hitler, and takes a concept that has been tried hundreds of times before and makes it right.Simply put, 'The Downfall' is a must see film that will leave you curious and intrigued for days after the final credits roll.",9,4,6,26 August 2009
The Blind Side," Lot of hype, little delivery
","This film had some potential, but instead plays it safe to become another rags-to-riches cliché.From the beginning, it is obvious the team went for a 'family friendly' film, which certainly holds back its realism. The story is well written and flows nicely, but nothing seems original here. Combined with Bullock's gag worthy cliché lines, it just seems too much.Bullock's acting is done well, but nothing close to a stellar performance. Quinton Aaron does little, if anything, to further convince the audience of his horrendous life beyond occasional sad glances and moping around. The rest of the characters, including Tim McGraw's, are decent additions to the story.Overall, 'The Blind Side' seemed like a mass produced, over hyped, rags-to-riches story in a genre that has been overdone (especially recently). If you're looking for a good movie to pass the time on a bored Saturday night, I suggest you pick up the film. But if you're looking for a stellar story with plenty to love, don't even bother.",6,9,15,18 June 2010
