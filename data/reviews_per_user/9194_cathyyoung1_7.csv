The Devil's Advocate," Superb Pacino in suspenseful, well-crafted, often smart movie
","Is 'The Devil's Advocate' a masterpiece?  Certainly not.  Is it a profound philosophical treatise on good and evil?  Uh, no.  It's a well-made, effective thriller that is definitely worth the price of the rental if only for Al Pacino's magnificent performance as John Milton, the powerful New York lawyer.  ('I'm a little more than that, Kevin.')  Pacino does NOT overact -- he is quite low-key when it's called for, and even in episodes where the screenplay could easily make him sound bombastic, there isn't a single false note in his performance.  His charisma and magnetism are such that it's not hard to imagine falling under this Devil's spell!Keanu Reeves is decent here -- I don't think he has much talent, but his performance as the up-and-coming lawyer Kevin Lomax, who becomes Milton's protege, is quite competent and does not drag the movie down.  (Though, after seeing 'The Firm,' I wished they'd given the Kevin Lomax role to Tom Cruise -- who, IMHO, is very overrated, but he sure is a better actor than Keanu.)  I was very impressed by Charlize Theron as Kevin's wife Mary Ann; she does a good job of portraying her character's evolution from exuberant small-town girl to a guilt-ridden woman tormented by horrible visions.The story was very well-crafted.  Some of the 'Rosemary's Baby' stuff was overdone (like that whole scene with the baby playing with Mary Ann's ovaries -- yecch!), but the special effects with people morphing into demons were good and actually scary.  One of the things I liked about the way the story developed was that while Kevin was being tempted, Milton (as he points out in his speech toward the end) not only never made him do anything and left all the decisions to him, but gave him every opportunity to bow out and do the right thing.Unlike some people, I liked the finale a lot.  The final twist saves it from being a trite 'happy ending.'",7,0,1,11 May 2000
Ed Wood," Some wonderful moments and one truly great performance, but not a great film
","Maybe you have to be really into the bizarre to truly love 'Ed Wood.'  Yes, it was fun to watch a well-made movie about the making of awful movies and about a 'family' of colorfully dysfunctional, marginalized individuals (though in my view, 'Boogie Nights' succeeds better on both counts).  But, in the end, what was the point?  Were we supposed to be moved by the sincerity of Ed's dreams and by his intense commitment to his vision, even if the end product of his vision was some of the worst dreck ever put on film?  In other words, was the Orson Welles analogy semi-serious?  This could have been a film about self-deception and delusion, but Tim Burton had too much fun with these delusions to really explore their pathetic side.In addition, I was very unimpressed by Johnny Depp.  Most of the time he was just glaring and grinning, and I never found him moving in the emotional scenes.  Sarah Jessica Parker, who is so good is 'Sex and the City,' is merely OK here.  On the other hand, Martin Landau gives a magnificent, unforgettable, deeply moving performance as the aged Bela Lugosi -- 'Ed Wood' is definitely worth seeing just for him.  Also, Patricia Arquette is excellent as Kathy, the love of Ed's life.  The moment she appears on the screen, you forget all about Depp and you know you're seeing real talent. (Too bad we don't get to see more of her.)  Bill Murray shines in a small part as a would-be transsexual, and the underrated Jeffrey Jones is very good as a TV 'psychic.'It's a very enteraining and amusing movie, but the only parts of it I'd care to see again are the ones with Landau.  I suspect that the high rating this movie has received (I wouldn't give it more than a 6) is due to Ed Wood's cult status as the worst filmmaker of all time.",Null,0,2,4 June 2000
L.A. Confidential," Brilliant, powerful, gripping
","A top-notch dark drama of crime and corruption, 'LA Confidential' is one of the most memorable films of the 1990s, thanks to an intelligent and cliche-free script, good direction, and superb acting.  I'd have to single out Kevin Spacey, who is great in everything (he even redeems 'Outbreak' from total mediocrity, overshadowing Dustin Hoffman).  Here, he truly shines as Jack Vincennes, an urbane, charming, cynical, somewhat corrupt cop struggling with his conscience.  Almost as outstanding is Danny DeVito as the sleazy tabloid journalist Sid Hudgins.  Kim Basinger gives her subtlest and most nuanced performance ever as Lynn, the call girl made to look like Veronica Lake.  Russell Crowe is excellent as Bud White, the brutish but good-hearted cop, and Guy Pearce gives an utterly convincing and often mesmerizing performance as Edmund Exley, the police officer who starts out as a self-righteous, priggish, ice-cold careerist and then becomes a man of true moral conviction who also has humanity and compassion.  In a lesser but crucial role, James Cromwell is very good as Captain Dudley Smith.The plot was somewhat convoluted, and sometimes it was hard to understand how the characters grasped connections between things that weren't so readily apparent.  However, the film remained suspenseful throughout.  (In a key moment, the identity of the villain is revealed in an act so swift and unexpected that you're guaranteed to jump!) The suspense is well balanced by humor.  What is also impressive about 'LA Confidential' is the character development.  Exley, White, and Vincennes really grow as human beings in the course of the film, and these changes are conveyed not only through the dialogue and through their actions but also, particularly in Exley's case, through body language and demeanor.  (I don't understand why Guy Pearce isn't getting more good roles!)Truly a wonderful film.",8,1,1,10 May 2000
Event Horizon," Interesting concept, bloody mess of a movie
","I looked forward to seeing this movie mainly because I'm a Sam Neill fan -- he's an excellent, underrated actor who doesn't get enough good roles.  The basic premise (a haunted ship that has literally been to hell and back) also sounded interesting.  Well, it all adds up to maybe not THE worst movie of all time, but unquestionably one of them.The beginning, maybe the first 40 minutes or so, was actually not bad, and Sam Neill created an interesting character as Dr. Weir, a lonely man tormented by guilt over his wife's suicide.  There was also some genuine suspense, with ominous little hints that horrible things were about to happen.  Unfortunately, once the anticipation ended and the actual horrors began, 'Event Horizon' became ridiculous and revolting.Anderson is one of those directors who seem to think that to create terror, you have to show rivers of blood and graphic images of human flesh being torn apart with the guts hanging out.  At a certain point, though, it all becomes really gross, rather than scary.  For truly frightening films, see 'Rosemary's Baby' or 'Repulsion' (another Roman Polanski film), which relied strictly on psychological horror.In the second half of 'Event Horizon,' Neill's character became so grotesque that even the best actor couldn't have done anything decent with it. Laurence Fishburne is a good actor but he was much better in 'Just Cause' (even though it was a pretty mediocre movie).'Event Horizon' is a total waste of time and talent.",Null,1,2,11 May 2000
There's Something About Mary," No, it's not the funniest movie of the decade--but still pretty hilarious
","Generally speaking, gross-out comedy doesn't have much appeal to me, so I didn't expect to like 'There's Something About Mary.'  Having seen it, though, I have to say that there really is something about 'There's Something About Mary.'  There were a few scenes that I think went a bit too far in the gross-out department (no need, really, for the close-up in the penis-stuck-in-the-zipper scene, or for the fish-hook through the lip; I also thought the masturbation/semen-as-hair-gel thing was superfluous and not all that funny).  However, there was a lot more to this movie than gross-out jokes.  I thought much of the dialogue was actually quite smart, and the wacky humor was deliciously unpredictable -- for instance, the episode where Pat, the sleazy detective played by Matt Dillon, gives Ted (Ben Stiller) the false report on Mary in order to get Ted to lose interest in getting together with her; the hitchhiker with the 'six-minute abs' pitch; Pat telling Mary he loves 'working with retards'; the cell-phone conversation Pat intends for Mary to overhear.  The scenes with Puffy the dog were hilarious too, and I usually CRINGE at any suggestion of cruelty to animals!  I rather liked the plot twists, especially the one involving Mary's friend Tucker (brilliantly played by the British comedian Lee Evans). And guess what, I thought there was something very sweet about the romance in 'Mary.'  Ben Stiller creates a believable and (despite his many faults) ultimately sympathetic character.  And as Mary, Cameron Diaz projects an irresistible mix of naivete, good-heartedness, and spirit.  So what if it's not very plausible that she would be a successful surgeon?  This is an eccentric comedy, not a serious drama.  (To me, Cameron Diaz as a surgeon is much more plausible than Julia Roberts as a hooker.)   The film actually makes you care about these people -- in addition to making you laugh.",8,0,0,12 May 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," An illustrious career ends, sadly, with a dud
","Last night I finally saw 'Eyes Wide Shut.'  The only good thing I can say is that it is often visually stunning (though nowhere near 'A Clockwork Orange').  The story, moving at a glacial pace, was peculiarly uninvolving. The attempt to convey a sense of nightmarish, hallucinatory dread ended up being merely ponderous and ludicrous (especially in the infamous orgy scene; Kubrick seems to have had a most peculiar idea of forbidden sexual adventure in 1990s New York).  The dialogue, much of the time, was banal beyond belief, and the acting was mediocre at best -- with Sydney Pollack as Victor Ziegler and Marie Richardson as Marion the only two exceptions.  I've never thought much of Tom Cruise as an actor, but he was far better in 'The Firm' -- here, you never for a moment forget that you're looking at Tom Cruise pretending to be a doctor.  Nicole Kidman was better, but in the key scene where she confesses to having lusted for another man, her delivery was somehow very unconvincing.The basic concept -- a husband and wife rediscovering their passionate erotic connection through (unconsummated) sexual experimentation outside their marriage -- is interesting enough.  But for it to work, the viewer must care for the protagonists and for their marriage (which EWS fails to achieve), and there must be real onscreen chemistry between them (which is completely absent here).  There is, in fact, no eroticism in the film at all, extramarital or marital; of course, Kubrick has always been a very cold and anti-sensual director (post-'Lolita,' at least), so maybe this just wasn't the right film for him to make.Kubrick has made some of this century's true cinematic masterpieces -- 'Paths of Glory,' 'Dr. Strangelove,' 'A Clockwork Orange' -- and other superb films such as 'Lolita' and 'Full Metal Jacket.'  (I've never cared much for 'The Shining.') This is not the film he will be remembered by.",4,8,13,14 May 2000
Titanic," Delighted to find so many fellow Titanic-bashers
","The only good thing about this movie are the special effects (truly incredible!), including the underwater scenes.  What else does it have? Let's see:One of the worst screenplays ever put on film.One-dimensional, dull, trite characters who are either improbably admirable (our lovely Rose can appreciate Picasso, knows all about Dr. Freud, and can figure out that there aren't enough lifeboats for all the passengers!) or ridiculously evil (Cal, the guy played by Billy Zane).  Not to mention tiresome cliches of the noble poor vs the ignoble rich.Leonardo di Caprio, basically modeling instead of acting.  Kate Winslet doing a more decent job, but nowhere near her performance in 'Sense and Sensibility' where she was given a real character to play.The only emotion generated by this movie came from knowing that more than 1,200 people actually did die on the Titanic.  And even the disaster scenes weren't nearly as affecting as they should have been -- because the lives and deaths of thousands became merely a backdrop to the romance between Kate and Leo (sorry, Rose and Jack) and the question of whether they would survive.  (Personally, I found myself wishing they had both drowned early in the movie when Rose tried to jump and Jack was going to jump after her.)If you want to see a GOOD movie about the Titanic, rent 'A Night to Remember.'  It was made, I think, in 1948 and obviously had very poor special effects by today's standards, but it did an incomparably superior job of telling the story of the ship and its passengers.  (By the way, the only good bits of dialogue in 'Titanic' -- the conversations between the crew when they realize the ship is going to sink -- are basically lifted from that film.)  Wisely, 'A Night to Remember' doesn't focus on a couple of central characters and instead shows us many different people, who are much more fully fleshed out in the small vignettes they get than Jack and Rose were in all those unbearable hours of screen time.  In that way, 'A Night to Remember' truly captures the human tragedy of what happened.The fact that 'Titanic' won the Best Picture award in a year that saw such superb films as 'LA Confidential' and (one of my all-time favorites) 'Boogie Nights' just shows the cowardice of the Academy and the marketing power of 13-year-old girls.",5,8,14,10 May 2000
