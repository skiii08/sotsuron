The Avengers," what a disaster...
","huge rating on IMDb, woaw really ? well the movie must be good so...but...hum... finally, after 2h and something, well it has nothing to do with a 8.7 movie.Seriously, like it is mentioned in several occasions in other reviews, there is almost zero carachter developments, zero plot, zero reason for these heroes and villains to do what they are doing, who is behind loky, why the invasion, what's at stack on the long run, nothing but a series of pointless discussions and arguing between characters, nothing more.the scenario is ten times viewed before, the hole in the sky with monster coming to manathan, i mean how long ago was ghostbusters made ? the kind of flying worms are super close to the transformer 3 same type of monsters. the screenplay/storyboard work are just average, just a few stunning moment,, not epic developments, no just a basic movie for kids, that;s all I can see here.To be fair and honest, if the rating of this movie would have been what it should be, around 6 to 7, i would have given a 4 or 5 rating but as obviously, some marketing companies are pushing the rates up, I must deliver a simple 1 to contribute to balance things for readers who keeps on looking at the rating before watching this in theatre or buying an expensive blue ray 3d DVD.Really, a below average action pack movie, nothing more.",5,10,40,24 September 2012
Catch Me If You Can," A smart and educated Crime movie
","I didn't really know what to expect when I started to watched this movie. Probably something interesting and fast, based on a true story, benefiting from spielber's experience, but, I just wasn't sure it it would be good.and in my case it was a good surprise.Di Caprio and Hanks are playing at a good level. Most of situations are credible, this could haven happen more or less this way. The secondary carachters like di caprio's mother and fathers are not much developed but that give chance to faster pace and doesn't really harm the viewer involment with the main character. We can kind of understand what pushed the situation to start and develop this way.There is also no glorification of crimes or criminal, Tom Hanks also doesn't represent a model saint cops leading a crusade against check forgers.All in one, the story of two opposite personalities, with somehow similar wound and weaknesses, a 'smart' crime movie, shown in a fast pace story telling and realistic environment made me arrive at the end to think 'is that already finished', which doesn't happens often in my case.Would recommend it without hesitations.",8,2,3,24 September 2012
Ted," good pop corn comedy with ironic sense
","I started to watch this movie without knowing that set mc falrane from family guy was behind this. I therefore didn't place any expectations with this movie. In fact I wasn't even sure if the bear would be kind or more 'rude' in the sense of Paul's movie.This being said, I discover the movie as it came, and I must say that even thought it is not a glorious piece of comedy, still it is a good movie, mixing jokes with the questions related to our modern'age adult who are sometimes still acting like kids after they passed the 30's.the family guy spirit is there, a bit, with Ted's comment, but it's time to time to my opinion, and Mark Walberg play an average performance which leaves overall an OK experience.Not a super great movie, but cool to watch, especially if you lived during, or like, the 80s which are a constant reference in the movie.i rate 7 as 7.5 is not available.",7,0,1,10 December 2012
Ready Player One," disjointed, redundant, aimless
","A start to fast to seem true, lack of carachter and situation development, lack of real issue to solve, a quest unfolded at a bullet train speed, this final batttle grand final again, bref, an empty movie relaying too much om CGI.",5,3,8,3 April 2018
Looper," Average/Good Experienc
","The carachters are solid, good acting all the way through. General atmosphere is quite tense I must say. Murders, torture, fights are plenty but they are putted together with a stylish sense, images and sounds are designed to shock through the movie, at various moments (not a full non stop rate). Besides this, I would not develop or argue the plot(s), as this review is more for peoples who have not seen it yet than to expose my theory about this or that impossible facts. All in one I found the story to be believable.My disappointment and reason to note this movie just with a 6, is the general rhythm. It's quite inconsistent, not really flowing, and the 'emotional', sincere moments here to develop the psychology of the characters are a bit unconviencing to my opinion.Not bad in general, felt a bit bored after1h but the ending took eventually things right.",6,0,1,3 December 2012
