Hereditary," Totally overrated
","I have never rated a movie below 6. This one truly deserves a one. Things doesnt make sense, very poor history, not scary at all.",1,2,6,19 January 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Definitely not worth it
","I'm a big fan of Brad and Leo and their performance was brilliant, but the movie itself made me believe I was either high or drunk: there is no connection between scenes, there is no storyline and things seemed randomly built. I would not recommend this.",3,5,9,25 August 2019
