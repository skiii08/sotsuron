The Blair Witch Project," too much for me
","This movie was an interesting combination of fantasy and reality.  It pulled you into the story and I really felt a connection with the characters. Anyone who has spent time in the woods camping or hiking could feel a nerve being touched.  It became too much for me near the end and I'm very wary of trucking through the woods on my own anymore. 'Just a movie'? Perhaps, but a plausible enough story and it really gave the viewers a chance to exercise the imagination.  I think my imagination needs a long rest after this...anywhere but the woods.",Null,1,2,11 August 1999
Fight Club," What an amazing picture
","Okay, I've seen this more than a few times and found time to read the book as well.  It's really an amazing piece of work.  The pace keeps you riveted to the screen, the plot twist shakes you up and the music score enhances the overall feeling of the film.  I would have liked to see an expansion of 'Jack' after he realized what was happening to him,  the short clips gave you a taste but it left me wanting more.  Edward Norton is so talented, I loved his facial expressions, Helena Bonham Carter finally broke out of that porcelain doll stereotype and Brad Pitt, well, I've never seen anyone look so good in a pink bathrobe.  Forget what Roger Ebert says about this film. Go and see it for yourself and think about your own life.  Wouldn't it be great to have that kind of freedom?",9,0,1,18 November 1999
