"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," A movie/musical about dragqueens singing in the desert.
","This movie was horrible with no plot or moral.  There is no basic storyline and it is a poor attempt at humor.  The actors are weak and there is no support for their roles.  This movie is boring and in no way fun. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life.  It is absolutely horrible.  The only question left in your mind is who was worse in this film, Terence Stamp or Guy Pearce. You make the call.",Null,0,11,7 September 1998
"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," A movie about dragqueens that ravel through the desert.
",This movie is horrible.  The plot is senseless and is not in any way funny.  There is not any hidden humor and the characters are empty and shallow.  This movie drags on way too long and never comes to any real point.  The characters subject themselves to all the torture they receive and there is no sympathy for any of them. This movie is a waste of time and money and should be seen only by people who love looking at men in womens clothing.  This is with-out-a-doubt one of the worst movies I have ever seen.,Null,0,9,31 August 1998
Se7en," A vicious killer is stalked by two cops who will do anything to catch their man.
",This movie will leave you breathless.  A completely grotesque movie that keeps you in suspense from beginning to end.  A crazed serial killer will do anything to kill his victims according to the seven deadly sins.  This movie is creative and follows the planned murders of seven victims who 'deserved' to die.  Mills and Sommerset pull out all the stops in the classic horror freak movie.  It is cleverly done and the script is written in a way that the actors seem to stay one step ahead of the director.  Mills and Sommerset follow along awaiting the final confrontation and David Fincher keeps the viewer waiting to see how the killer completes his tasks. The movie will remain with you for ever as it will change your insight on life's little sins.,Null,0,0,6 August 1998
Armageddon," An 'out of this world' movie based on saving the world from an asteroid.
","What are the critics thinking?  When the crowds started to file out, 99% were cheering and raving about this movie.  If you are looking to be entertained, which is what movies are supposed to be for, this one is no let down.  It comes at you for almost 2 1/2 hours and never backs down. The plot is a little far fetched, but movies are created for your imagination. All the actors and actresses in this movie create an aura that keeps you intrigued and interested for the entire duration.  There is action, suspense , comedy, drama, romance, and all the aspects needed to make a fully rounded movie. The big surprise about this movie is the comedy aspect. You will laugh more than you will cheer.  Jerry created a great movie that will want to make you come back for more. The only unfortunate part about this movie is that there can't be a sequel.",Null,2,2,29 July 1998
Major League," A bunch of misfits make a run for the American League Pennant.
","A hilarious baseball movie about a bunch of misfits, cons, and old-timers that make the best of the situation and try to win the American League pennant.  The movie offers a lot of laughs as this group of so-called baseball players tries to overcome all the obstacles their owner puts in front of them.  Their new owner wants to move the team and can only do so by keeping attendance low.  She (Margaret Whitton) pulls out all the stops and tries to deter the Cleveland Indians from winning.  Charlie Sheen, Tom Beringer, and Corbin Bernsen lead an all-star cast is this all-out comedy that takes the Indians all the way to the pennant.  Bob Uecker plays the Indians play-by-play announcer as the lovable and funny Harry Doyle.  He throws in one-liners the whole movie and adds to the overall humor in this film.  If your a sports fan and love sports movies, this baseball 'blooper' is a great choice.",Null,0,1,30 July 1998
