Stop-Loss," Excellent eye opening movie...
","Loved the movie, loved the plot. I originally only went to the movie to look at Channing Tatum, and really got so involved in the story that I didn't really focus on him at all.This movie opened my eyes to what our soldiers go through over there and what kind of hell they are really in. It made me even more grateful for what they are doing over there, whether I agree with the reason we went there or not.The movie was not at all what I expected it to be. I thought it would be some typical light hearted far fetched storyline with lots of sex and silliness. In fact, it was a thought provoking, action packed, and engaging plot.I will buy this movie when it comes out and would recommend it to others.",10,8,18,28 March 2008
