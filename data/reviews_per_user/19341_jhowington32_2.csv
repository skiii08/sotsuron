The Expendables 2," expendables 2
","Expendables 2 is a bloody, fun, action packed thrill ride! This film once again has all the big time action stars from past, present, & Future! The action was well done! And all the names they added to the mix for this one made it all the more enjoyable! Jean Claude Van Damme played one hell of an bad mofo! The end fight between him & Sylvester Stallone was great! Having others like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, and yes even Chuck Norris was so awesome! The one liners were funny, they even busy chuck Norris's balls in this, and it played perfectly! This Expendables was a thousand times better than the 1st one, & it left me super pumped to see who, they are going to add to the mix for a 3rd film! Steven Seagal? Nick Cage? Michael jai white? Wesley Snipes? How bout Kurt Russell? There is no end to the testosterone that could be thrown into future films! Check it out! The only gripe I have with this film is.. Enough with the CGI blood!! What ever happened to good old fashion blood squibs? They defiantly don't make movies like they use to, witch is sad! Don't get me wrong, CGI works, & helps certain things quite effectively! But for a movie that wants to be that throw back action flick of the 80's-90's they should have shot this thing like it were the 80's or 90's! Take a page out of grindhouse's or machete's book for the next one PLEASE! No more cgi blood!",8,2,5,19 August 2012
World War Z," 6.5/10
","I'm aware this film is nothing like the book. I went into the film with an open mind. I'm glad I did! With all the bad press this production got ( re-writes, re-shoots, the feud between brad Pitt and the director Marc Forster, etc) I thought this movie was doomed to fail! All that aside it really wasn't that bad of a film. Yes the zombies ran, and I hated that about the film. There was practically NO GORE what so ever! There are a few very intense moments. The action and camera work was decent. Other things were iffy for me too. But! They totally try to set this film up for a franchise, and if they do they can make a much better WWZ film. They can completely expand on what they've started. And make this a worthwhile franchise. One episode of The Walking Dead is much more violent, bloody, and more of a textbook zombie story. A story witch I Prefer! But all and all this was still an entertaining summer film! Once again the 3D was done in post conversion and was pretty pointless to see it in 3D. I saw it on the RPX screen witch is almost an IMAX screen so I had no choice but to see it in 3D.",7,0,3,22 June 2013
