The Ring," Not the movie I expected...
","The Ring was a great movie, don't get me wrong, but I was really disappointed because of all the hype surrounding this movie in its debut. The guy in the seat beside me seemed to actually be scared by the first few minutes of the movie.  My problem became the obvious scenarios and ploys to scare. The 'scary' parts, for the majority of the movie, were completely predictable and disappointing.  There were a select few that made me jump a little, but nothing like I expected.Also, the love story in the movie gave me a sour taste in my mouth.  It seemed as though they had just thrown that in for effect.  Unfortunately, it did not achieve the effect they were hoping.  They could have minimized this part of the movie.Also, the Samara character didn't make a lot of sense in her actions throughout the movie.  We all understood her evil nature; what we did not understand were the ways in which she killed (like coming out of the TV...)The movie was overall quite interesting, but I cannot give this movie the standing ovation it seemed to receieve everywhere else.",Null,0,1,27 March 2003
