Ford v Ferrari," Could have been epic, ruined by cliches, and a total apathy for accuracy, film pace and realism
","If you know bugger all about racing and don't care about an avalanche of Hollywood cliches, I'm sure you will love this. It's beautiful, Bale and Damon are wonderful as always, the sound it wonderful and there are more than one funny scene that made me laugh.However, if you are interested in racing and Le Mans, you will find this toe curling. First of all because of all the cliches are just standing in line for the full length of the movie. Most of all the ever-present protagonist-driver-changes-gear-and-reveals-that-he-hadn't-floored-the-accelerator-until-now stupidity. In fact they repeat this once every five minutes. And of course the drivers' ability to look over at other drivers for seconds at a time while they sit in a race car that does 974 km/h! Oh and of course the Hollywood cliche that never fails: Le Mans drivers that drive like it's stock car racing. Slamming into each other, going off the road intentionally, spinning and crashing out in epic fireballs ... they are all there in their vomit inducing glory. There's the totally unrealistic racing environment, handling of the race cars, driver and pit crew behaviour, a totally unbelievable person gallery and a farcical historical depiction. And of course there is the oh-so-evil suit and tie wearing villains and the oh-so-good heroes, which we are supposed to believe actually existed.Sigh! I felt absolutely nothing for any of the people at the end. Neither for the good guys nor the bad. If you are a racing fan, don't go watch this garbage.",3,39,83,24 November 2019
Alien 3," I really don't get all the negative reviews
","Rotten Tomates, reviewers all over the world and even David Fincher hated it, I know all that. Well, I LOVE it! David Fincher has since grown into my favourite director of today, but that's beside the point.Just because a film is not what people expected doesn't mean it isn't a great film. I think Alien³ is severely misunderstood. One should see it for what it is: a third Alien film, which - just like the sequel - aims to be something entirely different than the other two. This is a 'Where am I? And where is that thing that's scaring me shitless? Who's gonna be next?'-film.I really loved the cinema version, but the Assembly Cut is absolutely fabulous! SO atmospheric and so full of little details. I love the atmosphere of this film. I love how it's set. I love the plot! I love how once again they try to make a completely different Alien film, just like the second was so much different from the first one. I like how they mainly used British actors to show that they have a different accent on a far away planet like this. I love how the intro is cut. I love the lighting. I love Charles Dance - the duke of cool. I love Brian Glover as the warden. I love Ralph Brown as Mr. '85' Aaron. I love the way you never know where you are, just as it was intended. I love all the extended footage from the 2003 Assembly Cut. And I love the ending, even though I was of course appalled the first time I saw it.No, I just don't get all the negative reviews. I absolutely love this film. Yes, Aliens (the second one) was the best of the lot, but I think Alien³ is every bit as good as Alien. It is the 4th one in the series that is an embarrassment. Houw, talk about a shameless, dogshit attempt at milking a great story for more money! But that's a different story.",10,6,11,14 May 2016
Inglourious Basterds," Absolute dogshit!
","I love what Tarantino did in the 90s. I'm as big a fan of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. However, I didn't really know what to expect with this one. After half an hour, I knew this would be a huge disappointment, and after an hour, I kept feeling the temptation to simply stop watching the film then and there.Quention Tarantino has completely lost the magic that gave the breakfast scene in Reservoir Dogs its magic. It seemed incomprehensible at that time to see a bunch of gangsters around a breakfast table discussion Madonna, 70s music and whether to tip or not, but Tarantino pulled it off with brilliant dialogue and brilliant actors.This magic has been fading away for his past three films and is completely gone now. Tarantino can no longer create such scenes, and this film just reeks of his futile attempts to do just that. Again and again! The scenes are DREADFULLY long and the dialogue is downright boring.The acting is fabulous and the cinematography is still very good. The actors speak absolutely fluent French and German, and I love that all the people in the film speak their own language and not English. That's what I give the 3 stars for. The rest of the film gets a solid 0.Mr. Tarantino, you're over the hill and your last three films have sucked increasingly. I have no doubt your die hard fans will still be there for you, but I won't be giving any more of your films a chance.A complete turd of a film.",3,20,36,21 October 2010
"I, Tonya"," A masterpiece
","I don't want to get too much into the Tonya Hardings / Nancy Kerrigan story, because that's not why I give this film a 10. It is because this is simply two hours that fly by! Everything about this film is top notch. The cinematography is brilliant. The soundtrack is possibly the best I've ever heard. The storytelling is fabulous, right up there with films like Magnolia. And then of course there is the acting. Stunning. Absolutely stunning performances by Margot Robbie and Allison Janney.I can recommend this film to just about anyone above the age of 18. A masterpiece!",10,2,4,1 February 2018
Pearl Harbor," Well, they got two things right ...
",The location of the event and the date. The rest is made up Hollywood rubbish from start to finish. Add to this all the clichés that are just standing in line to be served to the popcorn munching audience and the love story that you really don't give a toss about. Then you have this cow pat of a film. Don't ever waste your time or money on this bilge.,2,0,4,13 June 2017
The Love Guru," Hilarious
","I really don't understand why people don't think this film is funny. I laugh more or less constantly. Yes, 80% of the jokes are below the waist. So what?!? I'm a grown man who's not afraid of my inner child, and I think a town names Harinmakeesta is hilarious. I think the ball gazing trick is great fun. I think Timberlake is great fun as the goaltender who's hung like a horse. I think the guru's book titles are incredibly funny.",9,1,4,2 June 2017
Schindler's List," Never cried until now
","This movie is the most touching story I've ever seen. Usually, the tear-quenchers of today never provoke any stronger emotions within me, but Schindler's List, which I've seen about ten times by now, has me crying every single time, and we're talking AFTER the film ends. The fact that a person like Oskar Schindler existed is simply fantastic. 1200 people lived through the WW2, purely because of this one man, who could have opted to live like a king for the rest of his life, but chose to throw all his riches away to save the lives of people, he hardly knew.It's a HARD movie, that will repel you and make you sick to your stomach. But it's a must see! Please don't miss it!And Steven Spielberg ... thank you! You're the man. Oh well, Kubrick will always be the man, but you come close!",10,9,14,27 June 2001
A Clockwork Orange," Best movie ever made
","A Clockwork Orange is the finest film that has ever been made, in my view. Stanley Kubrick has made so many masterpieces, and is by far the best director that ever graced our world. A Clockwork Orange is simply his finest hour!The film grabs you and glues you to your seat from start to finish. Malcolm McDowell gives us a shining example of superior acting, and the movie is as perverted as any of Kubrick's masterpieces (and then some!). It contains horrifying violence, extreme emotions, perversity and weirdness at it's very worst. It all boils down to serve you a plethora of thoughts for you to take with you and contemplate, after the film ends.However, with all the perversity bursting out of this film, you will probably NOT like this film the first time you see it. I know I didn't. Fortunately, I gave it a second chance, and thought: Hey, it was actually not bad at all. After the third time, I was lost for words.After the fourth time, there was little doubt in my mind, that this was the finest film ever made, and regardless of how many great masterpieces I see, A Clockwork Orange still towers above them. I'm sure you'll agree, if you give it the chance it deserves, although it may require for you to see it more than once.",10,596,951,27 June 2001
The Shape of Water," Stunning to look at, great acting but a rubbish story
","Mixed feelings about this one, I have to say. A slight spoiler alert is needed here, if you haven't seen the trailer. If you have, then you have seen half the film, as it so often is with modern trailers, regrettably.The cinematography is absolutely stunning and there isn't a scene in the film that your eyes won't feast on. An absolutely stunning film to look at. The acting is also just wonderful, particularly the villain. Michael Shannon is fabulous as a bad guy
 :), and more importantly: there aren't any weak links. All the acting are great or better.But the plot is rubbish. The love part simply isn't believable, the story is ludicrously unrealistic and you're just not feeling convinced by any of it. Not going to watch it again, but alright, I had a decent trip to the cinema at the end of the day.7 out of 10.",7,1,11,19 February 2018
Click," Great comedy meets a great lesson in life
","I expected this to be a great comedy with one of the best in the business: Adam Sandler. And it was precisely that, so I was not disappointed at all.However, as the film progressed, I realized that this is one of those few movies that actually had me thinking when I was done with it, which is exactly what characterizes truly great films. Even better, it has influenced my subsequent life. Yes, it is really that good! If you want great entertainment combined with a truly well taught lesson in life, this is for you.Oh yeah, and Walken is fabulous, but I expected nothing less from this great man. Thanks, Christopher. We can always count on you to elevate a film.It's much more than just a good flick - it's a masterpiece! 10/10!",10,3,6,23 October 2007
Alien: Covenant," Mr. Scott, please stop this silliness now!
","I'm afraid this film was exactly what I was afraid it would be: Prometheus 2. Even though I definitely didn't like Prometheus, I decided to give it yet another chance, even though they haven't made a decent Alien film since Alien³ (Yes, I absolutely loved the third one :-)).Having seen it yesterday, I simply don't understand why Ridley Scott would agree to make another hopelessly messy, confusing and substance devoid piece of garbage. Does he need the money? Otherwise why would he make a mockery of his own legacy?First the positives: the film is gorgeous looking. That's about it for the positive things. Other than this, the film is messy, the plot is ludicrous, the story is predictable and sloppy and lacks any kind of thread and the characters make exceptionally stupid decisions more or less continuously. Also, this is by far the most gory Alien film, which - as you can probably imagine - is saying something, but I really can't see why you would make it even more full of blood, slime and entrails than the good Alien films (The first three). I consider myself extremely unaffected by blood, gore and beheaded bodies, but several times during this film I was sitting there shaking my head: 'Oh come on! Making it gorier than a Saw flick doesn't make it a good film! Get a grip!'.I'm afraid this has made me much less excited about the new Blade Runner film, which I am going to watch later this year. I wish it hadn't, but I'm afraid that effect is inevitable. Now I fear it will be another Hollywood attempt at milking a legacy while shitting all over the original film's reputation. :(",5,8,18,15 May 2017
