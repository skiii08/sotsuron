Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," great movie for a 12-year-old
","The Phantom Menace really had little to offer for adults, other than a lot of eye candy and a bit of nostalgia.  The story was ho hum.  We heard a lot about painful death and suffering of a planet, but never even saw any of it. The baddest bad guy had almost nothing to say -- he just popped up a couple of times for a few seconds, and bandied about a light saber in two saber fights.  He looked like some guy I saw at a Halloween party last year.Visual effects were stunning, but to make a great movie you have to have characters you care about.  Phantom Menace had few of these.The good thing this movie has going for it is a hint at the transformation of Anakin Skywalker to come in the next two installments, under the apprenticeship of a young Obi-Wan Kenobi.",5,0,1,19 May 1999
