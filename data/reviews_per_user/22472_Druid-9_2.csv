The Blair Witch Project," Don't buy the hype. Not scary -- CREEPY.
","People have been burned by the hype for this movie. Let me offer a couple of suggestions to possibly prevent that from happening to any new viewers.1) Don't buy the hype. This is not the scariest movie ever made. In fact, there's not a single big scare in the entire movie. That doesn't mean it can't creep you out. There's something to be said for the painfully slow building of tension.2) Use your imagination. Try to pretend it's real. (Possibly a small spoiler here) Things will not be spelled out for you. Don't expect special effects. That's part of its charm. As Hitchcock could tell you, what you never see is far more moving that what you can.That's my advice. It's a great movie, but it's not the movie you've been hyped to believe it is.",9,1,2,16 August 1999
Schindler's List," Mixed feelings
","Spielberg is, and always will be, a master of manipulating your emotions. Nothing shows that better than this movie. Parts of it are overbearingly shot to elicit a reaction from the viewer, whether it be horror, shock, or joy.That's also partly the reason why I dislike this film. It's not a very good holocaust film. Pure Hollywood, even down to the black-and-white photography, which lends a sense of unrealness to the story. This is not how the holocaust should be told.Still, it is still good filmmaking. On the virtues of a historical movie, I give this 8 points out of 10.",Null,1,3,1 September 1999
