The Avengers," 'Marvel'ous Movie :)
","The experience of watching avengers with my friends in 3D was unique. This movie made me wanna celebrate the victory of Avengers over Dark forces in the Cinema. Joss Whedon did it again,made the most entertaining superhero movie with sheer awesomeness. All the superheroes did a good job,Loki made a great villain Tom Hiiddleston's cunning and nasty smile breathes life in his character of evil. Chris Hemswoth,Chris Evans,Jeremy Rener,Scarlett Johansson,Robert Downy Jr,Samuel L Jackson and Mark Ruffalo,means all were amazing in their roles. Except,the hulk stole the show.Especially in the scene where Hulk grab Loki and smack him on the floor. There are many other funny scenes. This movie got style, great effects and execution. This is a perfect summer movie.",9,2,6,6 April 2013
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The Bride is back to Kill Bill
","Well,as i have heard so much that this vol is much less action packed than the first volume but it perfectly succeeds in giving us the satisfying conclusion of a two-parter movie. Uma Thurman is awesome as always. This volume depicts David Carradine as ruthless Assassin Bill(Title Character),he is as tough previous volume has shown us. I liked the way it contains so much characters and presents us the Training of the Bride AKA Black Mamba by Pai Mei. The scene where she escapes from the grave covered in sand after which she goes to a coffee shop and asks the waiter 'May i have glass of water,Please? 'is quite funny. Again,This flick is full of references.Also,the one of references to the zombie and undead movie when she takes her hand out of the grave is clever. As i believe it pays a great deal of homage to the Western and old Chinese movies especially the training where the disciple learns from his master. When she plucks out the second eye of Elle,that scene is so Intense Daryl Hannah is quite the screamer. Michael Madsen's style is very decent as a typical Texas fellow who lives in a trailer park. Everything about this movie is quite good but not better than the First volume nevertheless it lands on a comforting climax which makes us happy and cheerful,not to mention B.B looks so cute and sweet. Great Job by every member of Cast and Crew. Thumbs Up.",8,3,6,8 July 2013
Scarface," Al Pacino killed it.
","Scarface,as the name implies ,the movie is as wicked as the name says. After his amazing work in Godfather series. It is treat to watch Al Pacino as a Cuban drug lord. This movie depicts the refugee's of Cuba and what happened in the 80's in true sense. The culture ,like the chicks ,cars,drugs and money ,a business run by one man ,Tony Montana. On the other hand it portrays different relationships of Tony with his sister,Gina,Elvira,his love interest and his sidekick and best friend,Manny Riberra played by Steven Bauer. I really liked every performance especially AL pacino's. It was a great inspiration to GTA :Vice City (On of my favorite video games) as i played the game first ,now i know from where those all things came from. The twist ending in the mansion where everyone dies including Tony makes it more great and reminds us all the where the path of crime ends. Everyone did a good Job. Michelle Pfeiffer,she looks so pretty and the most likable dialogue of her in movie is 'Would you stop saying f***' She portrays a drug addict perfectly Mary Elizabeth Mastranton,looks so cute in the beginning and turns to tramp as his brother Tony thinks,She is very good. Brian De Palma is spectacular. This is a splendid iconic gangster flick.",9,0,2,7 July 2013
The Hunger Games," Not quite the Battle Royale
","Thrilling,Engaging and entertaining dystopian action sci-fiction flick. Really liked the visuals and all the action scenes. This is the real deal of Drama and action. Screenplay,costumes and make up all are decent. Especially the make up and movie sets are very beautiful and elegant which make the people from novel come to life. Now,considering the novel,this movie adaption misses a few things i wanted to see on screen. One is I expected it to be more violent on screen with a R Rating but they made PG-13 Stuff, i don't know why,to make more money i guess. That shaky cinematography too. some of the important messages had been cut down. These things really disappoint me because i loved the novel and wanted it to be more precise. other than that it is good popcorn entertainer. Loved Jennifer Lawrence though. Acting is far far better than that Kristen-NO-Expression-Stewart. Not only Jennifer but all the actors did their job very good. Now looking forward to sequels.Hope they will be better.",7,43,54,8 October 2012
Argo," Argo is a real winner
","I must say this movie is just amazing. I did not know about the Canadian Caper incident but now i know more than anything.This is Ben Affleck's Masterpiece and it is breathtaking. Ben plays the master of disguise Tony Mendez and is quite a performance. Every actor especially who plays the trapped civilians are truly good. no wonder it has won an Oscar for Best movie and Best Adapted screenplayTense,dark,gloomy,clever and occasionally funny, it is so entertaining and not too long you would wonder how short it was.Alan Arkin really makes us laugh with his clever jokes . Cinematography is top-notch. The locations,sets and everything about this movie is so great. The climax is incredible so are the credits.R.I.P the victims and Praise the lord who sent a real hero to save those people and all the people who were on this case helping them.In Nutshell,Argo is masterpiece of modern film making. it makes us so happy so you cannot resist without saying 'Argo f**k yourself.",9,0,1,2 June 2013
L.A. Confidential," Perfection in neo-noir
","With it's brilliant pacing and neo-noir crime drama elements. L.A. Confidential stands one of the best crime films ever made. The incredible thing about this movie is acting,seems like every actor is living the character they are in. Russel Crowe just stands out as the tough cop and a man who hates women beaters,rapers and killers.His voice tone through the entire movie helps building his character,the other great aspect as anti-political. Kevin Spacey ,what could i say ,he is just awesome,his turn as a likable and smart Sgt really gives the plot a go-ahead.Especially the scene where with James Crowell. Guy Pearce ,just nailed the character of Ed Exley.His transformation from a fame-lover and political smart officer to a real justice seeking man is very good. Kim Basinger ,she is just beautiful and clever.she doesn't look so aged and her charm and acting deserved the academy. Every other supporting actor Danny DeVito,James Cromwell and David Strathairn are all good. Under Curtis Hanson's brilliant direction and Curtis Hanson Brian Helgeland's cleverly adapted screenplay from the novel of same name is quite interesting. Overall,this is a thrilling and one of the best neo-noir drama film with unexpected and great twists.",10,1,3,16 December 2013
Midnight in Paris," Good old days..
","This is the most nostalgic and elegant movie i have ever seen. the sets and locations of fantastic Paris are perfect. It is especially made with feel good factor which is the most crucial thing. Everything is just excellent ,Owen Wilson is so charming and sweet,his best performance so far,and the supportive cast did very good. Marion Cotillard looks so glamorous and lovely. Really liked those funny scenes with legends especially with Salvador Dali. My younger brother suggested me to read a short story 'The Third Level', by Jack Finney,before watching the movie. Both are extremely related. i really loved the concept of time traveling to 1920's 1890's and so on. Must say the best screenplay of the year and movie too. Woody Allen,you are just great.",9,0,1,13 October 2012
Horrible Bosses," Dean 'MF' Jones,the name is enough to make us laugh
","Well,it really was one of the best comedies of the year. As the name implies,The characters really do horrible things in the movie. If we talk about acting,it was top-notch. Jason Bateman,Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis succeed to make us laugh our butts off. The bosses did a great job too. Jennifer Aniston really looks sexy in the film.Major point,the language is very overdone but it is funny and hilarious. Seth Gordon took great turn with a new concept and old ways to depict.Jamie Foxx's character MF Jones,the name is enough to people laugh but he shines in his cameo. Every time one of the major characters call by his name,You would crack- up. There is some escapism and script problem but execution of movie is so good and it takes twists later which is a substantial point why it works.Overall,if you are looking for some dirty fun .do watch this movie.",7,0,1,12 December 2012
The Town," hats off to Ben Affleck
","I've watched this movie a year ago.. and watched it today with my brother.. he loved it too.. then i had a thought of rating this movie. Ben Aflleck's stunning direction and hardcore performances make this a great crime-drama flick. the action and chase sequences ,firing bullets,cat and mouse game,a lot of swearing and graphical way of depicting robbers lives really works for me.Ben affleck hit the bull's eye with the idea of showing the same thing in a different way. he has certainly earned it. Jeremy Renner is just perfect in the movie. Jon Hamm looks dashing and strong in supporting role. Rebecca Hall and Blake Lively did very good jobs. The Boston accent looks so damn real on all the actors they just nailed it In the end,not the perfect but a very good crime movie.",9,3,5,27 October 2012
Taxi Driver," Martin Scorcese's masterpiece with Robert De Niro at his best
","This psychological drama thriller is hard-hitting as well as one of the best movies.I liked all the characters and the climax was the highlight of the movie.There are so many possibilities for Climax but i interpret as a Dream sequence in which Travis Bickle is fantasizing in his comma that how healthy he is now in the society and with Betsy.Travis fights mobsters and Pimps just to save a little girl, Iris got caught in hell-like-world and he saves her from those mobsters and pimps ,Jodie Foster is too good in movie.As Albert Brooks debut was short but it was effective and proved to be useful for his further career,I liked him too.This movie is hard to forget as with such a great Storyline,Direction, and timeless Acting.So the Verdict,An all time classic and Martin Scorcese's masterpiece with Robert De Niro at his best.",10,0,0,19 April 2013
Life of Pi," Dazzling effects makes it Unforgettable
","Perfect Storytelling and great adaption of a novel which was considered unfilmable before the movie. Ang lee really broke grounds,to the level of avatar. Most visually enriched movie of the year. The magic lies within Special Effects and Cinematography. Great narration by Irrfan Khan as well as Good acting by Suraj Sharma. Not only visually but emotionally satisfying,i broke into tears during the movie and tears of joy in the end. I loved the reference Pi makes about Tiger,Sailor and his Mother to himself ,Zebra and orangutan. It gives us moral 'Never to lose hope and Keep Trying,There will definitely a way out of all problems'",9,4,7,30 March 2013
American Hustle," Cleverly crafted crime comedy
","Two con artists get trapped in a operation by a FBI officer which aims to expose the political leaders and mafia.When this goes too far ,everyone around them gets in it and it becomes a nightmare. American Hustle is surely a win as a period movie which depicts the ABSCAM operation done during the 1970's and 80's. I never heard of this sting before watching the movie. After watching it ,i searched everyone connected to it. According to that ,this is an entertaining turn by David O. Russell,as his style. He made it funny,raunchy and clever. Great screenplay combines with marvelous actors and throw in 80's songs,you get a classic. I would specially like to state Christian Bale's impeccable acting skills,he kills every scene and dialogue.His weight gain is another treat to watch.Seriously this man is a shape shifter. There isn't any role left which is physically demanding.Hats off. The second best thing in acting,of course,Amy Adams,seductive,sexy,kinky,naughty,strong and best character. She is too good and you barely get your eyes off of her. Bradley Cooper is just the right mix of ambition and cunningness. Jennifer Lawrence's character mostly annoys but that is good thing because it was meant to be that way which means she did her job in a most best way possible.Unaware of anything what is happening ,her unpredictability creates crazy situations but she is so sweet in some scenes. Jeremy Rener play his character smartly and most accurately,the look just suits him very much.Every other supportive member is good. Just loved the cameo by Robert De Niro and the twist ending. Yes,it has its flaws but who cares ?after watching it whole they just vanish. Overall,this is exuberantly fun movie,this is how a crime comedy period drama should be made.",8,0,2,22 March 2014
The Godfather: Part II," The best sequel-prequel ever made
","This movie is three hours and twenty two minutes long but an hour passes like 15 minutes.It is incredibly entertaining and one of the best gangster movie ever made. The plot is tricky featuring two parallel story lines,one of young Vito Corleone fighting with life's dark events,providing for his family,building a Don status and seeking revenge for the killing of his family while other depicts the Michael Corleone and his falling empire,family and life. Al Pacino is stand out in the movie cast.You just see the expressions and his eyes it can tell you the whole story. He has completely transformed to a ruthless,heartless and cold gangster but never stopped loving his family. The scene where Kay(Diane Keaton) tells him about that she aborted their child,Al is flawless and most realistic how his eyes pops out and how he knocks her down.He deserved the Oscar for best actor. Robert De Niro is impeccable.What do you expect when two of the greatest actors play two of the greatest characters. De Niro portrays the character with similar talent as Marlon Brando did. The way he speaks with same husky voice also his sicilian. His principles,taking care of things,returning the favor and rise to mafia is just marvelous. The best scenes are where he follows Fannuci at Festa to his house and kills him other one ,obviously where he stabs Don Ciccio and says 'My father's name was Antonio Andolini... and this is for you' is just brilliant. Diane Keaton portrays her character with utter excellence. Robert Duvall is as great as he was in the previous movie,the sophisticated lawyer ,caring brother and a good man. John Cazale character is bigger in this one and he is first class in the scene where he yells his heart out and in the whole movie. Michael Vincente Gazzo's performance is most realistic. The screenplay,style and violence is top notch. Again.Coppola's direction is mesmerizing. Overall,this is one of the best movie and not to be missed.",10,1,4,11 August 2013
Man of Steel," Not a perfect Superman movie but filled with exhilarating action
","Zack Snyder,David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan's Man of Steel,adaption of Superman by Jerry Siegel & Joe Shuster is innovative and pretty inventive with their new theory and visuals but it is still not up the mark as i expected from these guys,Especially from Nolan i expected as good as The Dark Knight. The hype couldn't let me resist from watching it. I have watched all the superman movies till this day and read a few comic books too. I would definitely say that 1978 version has better story than this. The character development and script is okay. Henry Cavill makes a great Superman but not expected Clark Kent. The one thing that stole the show is action,Special effects,splendid visuals and Digital animation all in 3D. It was a pretty good experience to watch the modified Krypton and superman powers in Perfect effects and 3D. Now waiting for the sequel ,hoping it would get better. Otherwise it was good movie.",8,5,9,23 June 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," Got Spider-Man wrong !
","There are two ways to write this review. 1.Comparing this to Sam Raimi's adaptions. 2.Not Comparing this to Sam Raimi's adaptions. I know that #1 is more fun and critical but i'll go with #2.I am big fan of Spider-Man movies since my childhood. After watching the trailer and the tagline 'The Untold Story',i became so excited for this adaption. I thought this would be different story and more fun so i was looking forward to it. After Watching the movie i was disappointed. The story is almost identical to Spider-Man (2002){Optional} What disappoints more that story is that it is rushed so much,cannot call this a fast-paced but a rushed movie. They got casting wrong,Andrew Garfield doesn't look like nerd and Peter Parker but he did a good job. Emma Stone 's character is not of great importance but she looks beautiful like a doll. Most of scenes like When Ben Parker Dies,Peter make Spidey suit etc are corny. Martin Sheen is funny and charming as Uncle Ben. acting is not that good as i expected. Main villain's appearances and evolution to Lizard is also cheesy. Action sequences are just OK except few where Spider -Man uses his Web. There was good comedy in this movie also the web machine and suit are strong points.The other likable thing is they followed the comic book. If i would've gone with #1 then i would've given it 30-40% In Nutshell,this is not the thing i expected but its good for time-pass . Just a one time watch",6,0,1,11 December 2012
Dallas Buyers Club," Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto steals the show.
","The story of an electrician (Ron Woodroof)who finds out that he has got only 30 days to live after being diagnosed with HIV.He asks the doctor directly for AZT but she refuses so he bribes a guy who works there to steal it from inventory.After cutting off of supply he flees to Mexico where he gets treated by non-toxic drugs which stands more useful against AZT,so he decides to illegally smuggle those drugs to USA for HIV infected people. He starts to visit different countries by making different combinations to prolong the life of patients by beginning a Dallas Buyers Club.I just wanted to write a short summary myself because this movie is so good. As everyone is saying ,i will say too that Matthew McConaughey gives the performance of his life and he deserves the praise but i really wanted Leo to win the academy.Anyway Matthew did a perfect job depicting cleverness to help people and earn dough Jared Leto is just incredible in portraying the trans woman .His acting gave me chills .Great ,talented and amazing Jared makes you laugh and cry. Hats off to Robin Mathews for that perfect make-up. Supportive cast,cinematography,screenplay are plus points . This movie is funny,emotional,explicit and entertaining in its own way. A must watch.",8,1,1,19 March 2014
District 9," A mind blowing science fiction masterpiece
","When i saw the poster of this movie two years ago,i was confused what kind of movie it is.I did not do any search ,just downloaded the movie and watched it but did not write review. After watching it yesterday with my brother,i felt to write a review for the movie which is so great and probably the best alien invasion movie. This piece of work blow your mind.The plot is original,the special effects are top-notch and the heart wrenching performance by Sharlto Copley. Some people say that the violence and profanity is overdone but i think it is just accurate and necessary for the movie. The gut-wrenching scenes involving prawns are fabulous. I loved the documentary-hand held camera style by Neill Blomkamp and his entire work. He is such a talented filmmaker. On the other hand it is no less than a thriller,it gives you chills. The scenes where they torture Wikus seems so realistic and cruel. Also it has a emotional side,when a mild-mannered and a good man faces these kind of things and misses his loving wife. Exhilarating sound editing , eye popping visuals and great assembled cast make this movie outstanding.",10,2,3,11 August 2013
Wreck-It Ralph," Splendid visuals and graphics with a winning story
","This is Disney's 52nd animated feature and i must say it's truly a magical film. It got some great visuals and graphics grinding through the whole movie,the soundtrack and background score is nice. It is a colorful and magical experience. Editing is perfect and most marvelous thing is the voice acting. John C. Reilly,Sarah Silverman,Jack McBrayer,Jane Lynch and Alan Tudyk did a fabulous job. This movie is surprisingly funny ,emotionally good and different story with a whole new concept. i don't think there is a world left by Disney's Studio,now it's the video game world. it sure make us feel nostalgic with all the characters and references.I wonder how could it not have won the Oscar, it is much better than Brave. but as the movie's moral. 'You don't need an award to tell you that you are better'Disney has done it again,this roller-coaster adventure ride is a winner.",9,1,1,2 June 2013
Django Unchained," A highly recommended western flick.
","The western soul with bloody and stylized sequences. This is,my friend is one of the finest movies of 2012. A great ending to the year,i suppose. I have not seen much western or spaghetti western movies.Way to start with great style of this movie. The actor i liked the most is Christoph Waltz. I think it is one of the greatest performances. His acting,style and every dialogue is so incredible. Especially i liked that part most when he kills a criminal in front of everyone and convince others that the criminal had it coming with his hands behind his head. The most sophisticated doctor and bounty hunter i have ever seen in any movie. He deserved the Academy award for Best Supporting Actor more than anyone. About our lead character Django played by Jamie Foxx,He is also very good. The great apprentice played by a Academy Award winner really well. Samuel.L Jackson,amazing like always. This time he played a eccentric black old man who ,Ironically does not like black men. Kerry Washington shows the real damsel-in-distress scenes and she is too good. Leonardo Dicaprio is mind blowing especially in the table sequence where his hand actually bled after he got hurt by hitting the glass too hard,He stayed in the character and it was so original,He is a great actor. I really loved the KKK styled attack Big Daddy's man planned on Dr and Django. It was real Tarantino style how they fight and talk.Tarantino always give surprises and he never miss to entertain us. Like all his previous movies,this has also clever dialogues and script. In the face of Western flick. The theme of slavery he chose is app-laudable,but i think involved the use of n-word far more times but as we all know our classic director, he is never wrong about swearing. The cameo of Tarnatino himself and old Django are impressive. Overall ,this movie is entertaining and outstanding.",9,0,2,7 July 2013
Drive," Voilent,tense,dark and Amazing
","Stylish,Violent,Fast Paced and Entertaining.With a great cast and Our Hero is a person who don't talk so much and always gives a mild smile but he can kill anyone instantly if anyone touches the one he loves the there neighbors. It is a perfect mix of Noir with Drama ,extensively made for full entertainment. Stunning performance by Ryan Gosling this movie lives up to expectations. A classic crime Thriller movie reminding of old hero type characters and villain. Carey Mulligan is so charming, Bryan Cranston is great , Ron Perlman is good as always but the best in Supporting role is Albert Brooks with his heart wrenching performance. They should make unique movies like this. one of the best action movie of 2011.",9,1,3,24 May 2013
Brave," Where has PIxarness gone ?
","Pixar is back with this fairy-tale fantasy. Really expected the old Pixar magic (Before Cars 2) but again this movie failed to do so. Yeah,this is a good fantasy tale with good characters but it doesn't feel quite like its a Pixar movie. Maybe because Pixar has mastered in perfection of animated movies and gave us masterpieces and unforgettable animated flicks. Visual effects are dazzling,colorful and over the top. Voice acting is strong and comedy element is as usual great. Characters are good but lack the development. What really lack is a script and wow moments. and there is one cheesy climax. I think studio must work on it hard and doesn't lost there touch with perfection. i really wanted to post that i love this movie i can't because i cannot overlook the negatives over positives. In Nutshell,I like this movie but expect Pixar to back in the game.",7,1,2,11 December 2012
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Kill Bill is mind blowing
","Well, i think it is one of the most violent and kick ass action movies. Everything about about this movie is bloody and freaking great. Quentin Tarantino really made some amazing strides. His style of doing everything especially the carnage and bloody spatter of showering blood when every limb get cut by katana.The great homage to Italian movie is evident,it is great. Also,it references to Japanese especially the samurai movies is very good. Last but not the least,homage to American culture of classic rape and revenge flicks. It is really a good mixture of everything and very entertaining. It's like watching Martial art movie in Tarantino style.Actors performance's are great Lucy Liu,Daryl Hannah and Chiaki Kuriyama(really liked her in school uniform,)as i heard Tarantino signed her because of his love for her movie Battle Royale and especially Uma Thurman,She is just breathtaking .The dark humor ,chicks fighting ,non-linear story line,clever dialogues and good cinematography. I really loved the story of O-Ren Ishii ,The animated sequence ,as violent and as amazing as the movie. Our genius director really knows how to depict every character. I have so much to say about this movie, but i think that will be all. Not Tarantino's masterpiece but a different,marvelous and high stylized approach,Thumbs Up. My Score is 8.5 but i am giving 9.",9,2,5,7 July 2013
The Artist," Silent Masterpiece
","This is one of the best movies of the year 2011. i haven't seen much black-white and silent films but this is a gem. It brings back all the innocence and simplicity but with a rare execution. The Artist works on every level depicting the rise and fall of a superstar of silent films whose career face a breakage after the popularity of films with voice. He lost all his fans and masses but not the new female superstar who he has inspired so much. Jean Dujardin is just excellent and most charming star,his smile is so good,he totally deserved to win the Academy and other accolades for portraying his character with perfection. Bérénice Bejo plays more of a supporting role she looks most charming,naughty and raunchy. Her dance with Jean in climax is amazing,totally marvelous. The scene where Jean attempts to shoot himself,the scene is heart throbbing. All the supporting cast and screenplay is splendid Direction by Michel Hazanavicius is over the top. It deserves all the respect,awards and appreciation. Must watch this movie get lost in a retro world.",9,4,6,11 December 2012
Reservoir Dogs," Tarantino Begins
","It's Tarantino's debut and breakthrough in Hollywood. i fully admire his efforts on the story and direction. Everybody just did a great job.Joe,Eddie and our prominent colors steals the show. Infrequent violence scenes make it powerful and the acting is just over the top.Screenplay rules. I really liked everyone but Steve Buscemi,Tim Roth and Harvey Keitel just steals the show. This movie starts the style of Tarantino's long conversation about pop culture,daily and criminal activities which people enjoys till now. Especially,the infamous cop-torture scene and the when Mr. Pink shoots at cops repeatedly are too good. This is a perfect crime movie. It's that kind of movie ,you can see 10 times ,if you liked it. It was my first non-linear storyline Hollywood movie ,they did it so perfectly that now i love this kind. It's fast pace wouldn't let you bore for one freaking second. People who love to see crime movies will surely adore it. Everything is so great which make this flick unforgettable.",10,0,0,23 December 2013
Mystic River," Sean+Kevin+Tim+Clint = Great drama movie
","*** Spoilers *** *** Spoilers *** *** Spoilers *** *** Spoilers *** Based on a crime novel of the same name by Dennis Lehne,this movie is entertaining and moving crime drama. I haven't read the novel but have heard that it is great too. Talking about acting,that is top-notch. Our three lead actors are really good especially Sean And Tim They deserved the academy award. The locations are really good and the scene when everything unravels (when Jimmy shoots Dave )is chilling. On the other hand,it was a bit predictable about Dave not being the killer,anyhow they managed to keep the suspense about the real one. This movie is just not about murdered girl of Jimmy but about the characters and their life after the incident which effected the great deal of their childhood. As Dave was cited as 'damaged goods' ,Jimmy ran a illegal crew and it made Sean detective. How the confusion,mental instability ,lying of one character changes his fate and how his wife takes him as someone else . Some people will hate the scene where Boyle get killed for what he did not do by his childhood friend but this isn't about the justice. IT is about the tension,word of mouth,rumors and how things looked to either character which made him do the worst thing he could ever imagine to his friend.This facts makes this movie better and non-clichÃ©d. Overall,This movie has an amazing screenplay ,great performances and direction,falls shorts for a masterpiece but it is outstanding in many aspects.",9,1,1,1 March 2014
Zero Dark Thirty," Zero Dark Thirty is entertaining and stunning
","A lot of critics are saying that this is best movie ever made but on the other side audience is opposing it's fictional elements. I am taking neither side,i am just gonna write how i felt about the movie.This movie was not made to depict the actual incident of OBL ,it's just a fictionalized version of the greatest manhunt in the history.Jessica Chastain is quite pleasing with her acting and all the supporting cast too.Technically ,it's really brilliant and thrilling ,must say the torture scenes looks quite real and disturbing. It's all about picking up the pieces for 10 years and BOOM ! Sound Editing is tremendously good. The movie get a little low between part because of it's highly detailed script about hunting ,some may will find it dull and boring but it's quite entertaining too.The best part of the movie is the climax,the last thirty minutes where they raid OBL's house and kill him,which is also the name of the movie. it gives us chills and set our teeth on edge.It may look wrong to some but in case of cinema and movie making. It is really great and enormous achievement .",8,0,2,2 June 2013
The Woman in Black," a triumph of classic supernatural horror genre
","Scary,thrilling and a decent classic horror movie with good acting. when the trailer was out i was so excited to watch this plus Daniel Radcliffe was playing Arthur. He really did a great job.He played his character with seriousness and maturity. other than that,The woman in black didn't missed any chance to make us jump from our seats . it was so chilling experience to watch it my room and when i was home alone. some scenes gave me a heart attack. The climax where she give a look at us is damn scary.What movie misses is the justification with Susan Hill's novel. the weak script and dull characterization.if this film got these things right .it would have been one of the best horror movies ever made. but,it doesn't disappoint you,you ask to be scared and you get what you asked for. At least,its better than that teen horror genre. a triumph of classic supernatural horror genre.",7,0,1,8 October 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Finally a satisfying conclusion
","I have loved the last two movies and was expecting a perfect conclusion to this epic-superhero-crime-saga. This movies is so fantastic. The new characters are well-depicted that are Bane,Catwoman,Talia and Blake a.k.a Robin. As this is Christopher Nolan's movie ,the acting is top-notch but i wanted to see more of Bane,he is good but not as Joker,anyways Tom Hardy did a great job especially physically and that nasty voice. Christian Bale is again the superhero,he is most unique. Anne Hathaway did very nice ,she looks smoking' hot kitty as the role demands. All other actors Morgan Freeman,Joseph Gordon,Gary Oldman,Michael Caine and Marion Cotillard did supported great. There are few scenes which gave us goosebumps like the one where Batman returns with the bat,and Hans Zimmer's music as always epic. but it doesn't feels perfect like the Dark Knight,maybe Heath Ledger Pulled out in that one ,but it's slightly lower that the last movie. Special effects are amazing,everything else is great and finally a satisfying conclusion.",9,7,11,11 December 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Epic Conclusion to the Epic series
","Dark,Thrilling,Engaging and entertaining. Visually breathtaking and emotionally wrenching,i really loved it. With the great performances by all the actors and with a great storyline. Final installment of this series was so waited and anticipated and it does not disappoint. One of the best movies so far.It can't be any good Harry Potter finally came to satisfying conclusion. I know it's somewhat disappointing for the franchise book lovers but it's best movie in the movie series. i loved how it ended and left a moral and great mark on all of our mind . But deep inside there is a sad feeling that there will not be Harry potter movies in the future . we will always miss you Harry Potter and your friends.",10,0,1,24 May 2013
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," triumph of visuals
","No doubt that it is best of the madagascar series.. More funnier,more colourful and just above in everything than original movies. Must say,the visual effects are fantastic and magnificent for a animated movie. Shinning and shimmering set of pieces are just too good. voice acting is just over the top,everybody did a great job. the gags,punches,jokes and slapstick really entertains us. The only weakness is its silliness and stupidity of script and how all the animals do the things they just can't do,but its fine because it is a animated movie for kids. but the story could have been better its really simple and predictable. in spite of not-so-good writing it is the most entertaining in the series and dazzling enough to take us on a bumpy ride with full of fun. Just switch off your brain,don't think what's happening and how is it happening and Enjoy the visually impressive and funniest animated flick of the year",8,0,1,27 October 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," Funny and horrifying at the same time
","This is what we call a original and entirely different attempt.Its a great horror movie. Funny and horrifying at the same time. I didn't get to watch a decent horror movie through months but then came this strange and innovative scripted slasher film.i really enjoyed it. when the movie started i was like' What the hell is going on ?' but going through movie i got everything. really good concept.Movie goes through different aspects. spectacular work with the cinematography ,music,editing and performances of all the actors and not to forget splendid visuals. Especially Fran Kranz and Kristen Connolly acted so well. Overall,its a modern type original,clever,creatively made and well crafted gore-fest flick with funny elements with something new to watch.",8,0,4,8 October 2012
The Godfather," Masterpiece of Coppola
","I have had this movie for many months but i never got time to watch it. Yesterday i did and i think ,like everybody say ,it is one of the best movies made ever. Al Pacino who was not very popular at that time make his breakthrough performance and he is just great in the role of Michael Corleone. About the legend Marlon Brando,he is just phenomenal,his facial expressions and husky voice just make his role one of the best characters. It is based on Mario Puzo's novel about five fictional mafia families and Must say he did a great job on screenplay too. There are some great as well as shocking scenes in this movie i.e. When Woltz wake up and finds a real severed head of a horse. Sonny beats up his brother-in-law Carlo. Prolonged fight between Connie and Carlo. Death of Apollonia Vitelli-Corleone. Death scene of Sonny ambushed by gang members at toll. The killings of all the other heads of Mafia families,Moe Green,Tesiso and Carlo. I loved the setting and style. James Caan,Richard S. Castellano,Robert Duvall,Diane Keaton & Talia Shire did great jobs too. Despite the many Anachronisms,this movie is just marvelous. I have read everything that Coppola dis to make this movie so outstanding. Maybe the best gangster movie ever made. Thanks Paramount,Francis Ford Coppola and every Cast-crew member related for producing this chef-d'oeuvre.",10,0,1,4 August 2013
