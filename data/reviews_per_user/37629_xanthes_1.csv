United 93," Start healing
","As a former flight attendant, I felt drawn to see this account of flight 93. As the movie started I recalled the series of events on 9/11 and how worried I was for friends that still worked for the airlines as well as friends that frequently traveled. I couldn't believe the miscommunication going on between the FAA and the military. I also thought it was amazing that our President couldn't be reached to get authorization for possible military action. Since this film is done in real time, there is no time to get to know the personal stories of the passengers/heroes. Even though I knew the outcome, I still found my self hoping that somehow they would be able to take over the plane and at least someone would survive. I think the real purpose of this film is to help us face that dreadful day but also to remember the American spirit...nothing is impossible. To all of our fallen heroes, may we never forget.",8,2,7,29 April 2006
