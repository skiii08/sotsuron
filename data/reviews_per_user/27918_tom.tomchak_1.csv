Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Cynical attempt to cash in on original Star Wars trilogy
","The 'Phantom Menace' makes an interesting comparison to the 'South Park, Bigger, Longer, Uncut'.  One film (South Park) while having incredibly profane dialog, does have a plot, character development and a moral lesson. The other (Phantom Menace) has wooden acting but overflows with special effects and seems to say slavery is a natural condition and should not be stopped.",2,0,1,23 May 2000
