The Sound of Music," The Most Refreshing Film I Have Ever Seen...
","Long ago when i was on to purchase my first movie series (about 200) one of my friends came to me and asked me if I add one more to my list... The film was The Sound of Music. I was delighted of course to buy the movie (It's nice when somebody else's is paying and you can copy it almost for free). a while after, I heard so many bad notes and comments about the movie like: Musicals are boring or Aeehh... Sound of Music, but I knew all of them people and I bet they had no idea what kind are Musicals. I Purchase it at last and after a long while in such an atmosphere, I watched it... My Goodness somebody catch me, i'm gonna fly right away. it was absolutely wonderful. Sweet Life, Good Things, Hope... It's even humor in a way. You'll gonna live this work. Julie Andrew is marvelously acting in this movie, the songs are great, and the location... what a great location for a movie... you're gonna cheer up living The Sound of Music",10,3,10,25 September 2006
Battleship Potemkin," Pure Cinamatic Masterwork, 'Eisenstein, Master of Cinema'
","If You're a Cinema freak go see this movie. If you're not go this movies. IT'S WILL BE AN EVENT IN YOUR LIFE. You better know Eisenstein in your life. and the beautifulness and human brutal scenes of his film: 'Battleship Potemkin'. Crowded scenes are absolutely beautiful.Camera movings rare but extraordinary. Eisenstein shot unbelievable pictures. He is Genius. Excellent angles. AND MONTAGE!!!! He is the one who invented it. the one who publish the theory. The theory witch cinema is owed to until the very today, and I can say even the most important event in cinema. from Citizen Kane, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Jurassic Park and The Lord of the Rings, you can see its trace. and yet nobody have understood the theory like Eisenstein did it itself. you can't imagine what pictures are awaiting you. he product 'Battleship Potemkin' in 20s. in that time cinema doesn't even have sound. but the beautifulness is that even without sound there's no need for him to say what he wants. PICTURES TALK FOR THEMSELVES. you even don't see too many incoming text as you used to see in silent movies. PICTURE TALK FOR THEMSELVES. Pure Cinema. Eisenstein is a Genius. when you become more precise on shots you ask yourself: 'How did He Shot These in 1925?' You know the cinema back then wasn't this improved. and this is a secret not too many directors got to reveal. Such 2001: A Space Odyssey that was something unbelievable in spite of the great shots, the Special Effects, in 60s when Bergman and Kurosawa and Godard in three parts of the world doing film-making (maybe masterpiecing) but Kubrick! Later You Can See these inventory works in Spielberg productions. but still 'Battleship Potemkin' is unbelievable. and I think it must be a very high production work. For whom that are more than a movie watcher and some kind of kind om domestics cinematic critic, 'Battleship Potemkin' have been in every Sight and Sound magazine's 10 Greatest Film Ever. and if you are a little more professional you may know that this magazine is one of the most reliable selections. in the end, as a suggestion: go see this movie, it change every bit of my cinematic point of view and it may do so to you. I Know I couldn't make you realize how important this Eisenstein is. I just a beginner in knowing his cinema. and I so lost in some scenes of 'Battleship Potemkin'. Maybe 50 times watch the movie and then you can say how this GREAT MAN THOUGHT in doing so...",10,1,1,17 June 2007
