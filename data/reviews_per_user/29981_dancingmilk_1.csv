Iron Man 3," Iron Man (Movie Character) RUINED!!!
","OK. Iron Man was possibly the best modern Marvel adaptation of one of their classic comic book characters. Iron Man 2 had some shortcomings but was still, on the whole, excellent. And Iron Man in The Avengers absolutely without a doubt made the film!! Up till now Robert Downey Jr has been killing it, without question!However, this third installment manages to fall completely off the mountain of awesomeness they had created. In a total turn around Tony Stark is now a lamenting, distressed, anxiety ridden shadow of his former self. The most compelling and interesting character Marvel had built, is now portrayed as a confused teen, not sure of his place in this world. He might have been acne ridden because this sums up your reaction to him. At no point is Iron Man/Tony Stark a character you can get behind and root for, and it takes a series of mishaps and oversights on his behalf to keep the movie plot going. And it gets worse, the portrayal of the Mandarin is inexcusable, they really should have keep his name out of the movie. The movie has the feel that it is going for a cheap surprisingly laugh, rather than any depth or conviction. Tony's one line genius is entirely absent and Tony and Rhodes bumble round like they are in an 80's cop show for much of the film. At Tony's best point he vaguely resembles Macgyver. Even the exchanges between Pepper and Tony are mechanical. Oh, and lets not forget the lame voice over, as if we are reading Tony Stark's secret diary of woe's!It is so disappointing to think that Iron Man has to some how recover from this horrible bad dream of a movie, to continue in The Avengers 2 and Iron Man 4.SO WHAT HAPPENED? I hear you scream...Shane Black is what happened!This was Shane Black's recipe for Iron Man 3. OK, lets take...two very poor 'threequels' to start...1 part Spider-man 3, 1 part X-men 3 add to that, something to mix it up a touch1 part, Spy Kids 1 part, Dawson's CreekThat sounds excellent, but something is missing, I need a dash of some classic, ah yes, my Oscar nominated 'Lethal Weapon 2'... the perfect finishing touch. (Our two 'heroes' in this film, in the shipyard, final scene, very reminiscent of good old' Mel and Danny). PLEASE, bring back Jon Favreau or Joss Whedon PLEASE!!!! In short, save your money and watch The Avengers or an earlier Iron Man in the comfort of your own home.",2,4,9,4 May 2013
