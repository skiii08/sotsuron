The Avengers," i LOVE it!
","BEST MOVIE I've seen this year so far. I saw it twice even though I'm a poor college student. It's awesome! The characters are GREAT and there are so many HILARIOUS lines. I was DYING of LAUGHTER, and I'm not usually one to laugh out loud while watching a movie unless its REALLY REALLY FUNNY. The acting is pretty darn GOOD and graphics are AMAZING as well. I CAN'T WAIT to get this on DVD! (although i have to wait until like what, September? XD.) I also cant wait for the SECOND one to come out, and for Captain America 2 and Thor 2 to come out! I watched Captain America/ Hulk/Thor AFTER watching Avengers twice. I WISH I saw them beforehand, but you don't HAVE to. Oh, and I wasn't TOO into these kind of superhero movies beforehand. Anyways, you MUST MUST GO SEE IT! :DDD",10,3,8,20 May 2012
