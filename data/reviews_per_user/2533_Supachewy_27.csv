Black Swan," Aronofsky Shows Psychoticness in his Finest Film
","The dark psychological thriller Black Swan is directed by Darren Aronofsky and stars Natalie Portman, Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel, Barbara Hershey, and Winona Ryder. The film takes place in modern day New York City.Nina Sayers (Portman) is a ballerina who performs in a New York City ballet company and her life centers around dance. Her mother, Erica (Hershey), was a ballerina and the two live together in an apartment and she has much control over Nina's life making sure that dance is her number one priority. When the production of Swan Lake begins at the opening of the season the director Thomas Leroy (Cassel) chooses Nina to be the lead of the Swan Queen instead of the veteran ballerina Beth (Ryder). Also Nina believes that a new dancer at the company Lily (Kunis) is trying to steal the lead role away from her so she has to stop her. But I didn't even talk about all the crazy hallucinations and rashes and stuff...The screenplay was written by Mark Heyman, and Andres Heinz, and John J. McLaughlin and it was absolutely brilliant. All the five leads were as developed as they needed to be so the viewer could live in Nina's insane world. The hallucinations were great and the parts that weren't hallucinations were great. From the very start of the film it was enthralling and and it absorbed you into its complex plot. The only problem I had with the screenplay was the ending, it was just not as great as the rest of the film. If it was more crazily dramatic and there are some things specifically I could say about the ending but I will not because it is a spoiler.Darren Aronofsky's direction was brilliant, and I have to say this is my favorite film of his so far. I am a big fan of Requiem for a Dream and The Wrestler but the two did not contain the beauty that this film contained. Speaking of The Wrestler I felt a lot of that film in this one, both are sports films but really not about sports, and both have the same sort of tracking shot which I really loved where the camera follows around either Rourke or Portman as they're just walking someplace. There is not one shot in this film that didn't feel appropriate, and the ballet scenes were absolutely beautiful. I loved a specific scene with Portman and Ryder in the hospital but I can't go into any details because it is a spoiler, but just know it was fantastic. People who think Inception is a mind bender haven't seen Black Swan.Natalie Portman gives an Oscar worthy performance in this film and if she doesn't win the trophy on February 27 I'm going to be very angry. Because Annette Bening in The Kids Are All Right can't even compete with her and if they just give it to Bening because she is older and never won before that is just a cheap shot. Portman is brilliant as a very shy, fragile, childish woman who just wants to live her dream as being the Swan Queen. In the final scene she confirmed to me that she gave the best performance of the year and also whenever she is interacting with another of the female leads in the film she is magnificent. She is fine with Cassel also, but there is no crazy parts with Cassel.Mila Kunis is known for her comedic roles in the TV shows 'Family Guy' and 'That 70's Show' or in the comedy Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and in this film she turned her back on comedy and decided to go to crazy psychological thriller. She was absolutely electric in this film and was perfect for the role. When she and Portman were on the screen together so many emotions were portrayed and it was just magnificent. I really hope that Kunis will stay in serious films like this one because she can truly be a star.Vincent Cassel is the director of Swan Lake and he is the only character that doesn't get involved in Nina's craziness really. He plays the part of a stage director brilliantly and it is exactly how I imagine that stressful world to be. He is attracted to Nina's character and tries to seduce her. Cassel is a very interesting actor and the only other movie I've seen him in was Ocean's 13 and I can't really judge his abilities by that. But in this film he shows much promise and I hope that he too stays around in American films because I know earlier this year he was in a couple of foreign ones.The classical score for this film by Clint Mansell was perfect. It added another layer of drama, and psychological horror to the film and I was in love with it the whole time. It worked great with the stage work and even better when Nina was going crazy.Overall I give this film a 9/10, it was fantastic and my only problem with it was the ending. If you are preparing for Oscar season this is a must see and it is the second best film of the year, the first being The Social Network. The whole entire cast delivers wonderful performances in this thrilling film. I recommend this to anyone who likes dark psychological thrillers or really the films of David Lynch. Aronofsky has his best film with this one and he will finally get an Oscar nomination. This film is absolutely crazy and I love it.",9,1,4,12 December 2010
To Be or Not to Be," Nothing is Better Than Nazi Comedy
","The comedy To Be or Not to Be is directed by Ernst Lubitsch and stars Carole Lombard and Jack Benny. The film takes place between 1939 and 1941 in Poland.The film starts off with a man believed to be Adolf Hitler standing in the middle of the streets of 1939 Warsaw. It is then discovered that he is only in a play and proving a point to the director that he does look like Hitler when the director said that the man does not. Maria and Joseph Tura (Lombard and Benny) are both actors for a theatre. Maria has a secret admirer in the audience who always comes to see her when her husband reads the line 'to be or not to be' and Joseph gets extremely offended by this. Then the war has started between Poland and Germany and the Turas have a part in helping their country...The screenplay for this film is one of the strongest aspects of the film. It has many classic one liners and is one of the best satires of the time period. The plot stays interesting the whole way through and the characters are all likable even though most of them do not have any depth. One of my favorite parts of the film is any scene with the Nazi Colonel in it who always blames his Captain for the mistakes he made.Lubitsch's direction for this film was mediocre. It was very straight forward direction, there was no risks in the shots he took, no complexity, just him deciding to put his camera right in front of the action. Lubitsch was able to get solid performances out of his whole cast, so that is a plus one for him as a director. I thought the film was lacking in the reaction shot close up department because that only makes a funny line funnier when I see the reaction another character has to it.Along with the direction the editing was very plain and simple. There were a lot of fade to blacks which made it seem like it was a play and that a scene had just finished. The shots were all very long, there was never any editing for any stylistic use. Now I know what many of you readers are saying now, it's 1942 not the 90s where every movie has stylistic editing. Well I agree with you but it is nice to sometimes see some variation.The acting for the film was another strong aspect. Lombard was excellent as Maria Tura. She acted like an actress and did so brilliantly and delivered her many witty lines just as brilliantly. Benny was fantastic as the great Polish actor Joseph Tura. Every line he said he delivered with such force that the comedy was great since he had the majority of the jokes. The rest of the supporting cast were all equally wonderful and had many memorable moments.The score for this film was exactly what it needed to be to add another layer to the humor. Deservingly so it was nominated for an Oscar. With all the slapstick humor in this film a good score is needed or else nothing will really be that funny and this score delivers the laughs.Overall I give this film a 7/10. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys classic comedies, especially satires. This one is much different than the comedies from today, and that's a good thing.",7,0,1,27 October 2010
Citizen Kane," Truly a Masterpiece
","The drama mystery Citizen Kane is directed by Orson Welles and stars Orson Welles, Joseph Cotten, and Dorothy Comingore. The film takes place in 1941 with flashbacks from as far back as the late eighteen hundreds.The film starts out with Charles Foster Kane (Welles) dieing in his castle with his last words being rose bud. At a news station a reporter is assigned to find out why Kane said those as his last words so he goes to everyone that Kane knew to find out. He discovers how at an early age Kane was taken away from his family to become a big success, how in his early twenties he began to run a newspaper, how as he got older he became one of the most powerful men in the country. The reporter learns about Kane's two marriages and divorces and how he also ran to become governor. This film is about the ups and downs of a life of an extremely wealthy man, and has one of the greatest morals of any film ever.The screenplay for this film was absolutely brilliant. It is extremely intriguing how it was set up as a mystery to discover the meaning behind Kane's final words rose bud but in doing so the audience discovers the life of Kane. The characters were all extremely elaborate and realistic and the film was entertaining the whole way through. The moral is great and films these days do not have morals anymore, which is why I don't really like them as much as the ones back in the day.Welles's direction was stunning. The camera movements were absolutely outstanding, few films direction can compare with this ones. It is extremely difficult to be the lead actor and director which is why I give extreme props to Mr. Welles. One of my favorite scenes in the film is when he is making his speech to the people when he is running for governor because I really like him, but then I also like when towards the end he is destroying some of his things it really makes me able to feel the pain he is going through. Also I believe the opening scene in the film where Kane dies is one of the most iconic scenes in film history.The acting for this film is as well wonderful. Orson Welles gave the performance of a lifetime, letting me love him when he is supposed to be loved and hate him when he is supposed to be hated. Everyone else in the supporting cast such as Cotten and Comingore did a fine job, but nothing award worthy. Welles really carried the film, if he did a poor job this film would not be widely regarded as the best film ever made.The score for this film is also legendary. It really adds another layer to the film making the emotions sink in even deeper. The film is known for its revolutionary sound and again I can think of few films that use sound as well as this one.Overall I give this film a 10/10 because it is perfect in every way. I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to see great quality in a film.",10,1,2,17 October 2010
Hostel," A Fresh Film For the Horror Genre
","The Horror film Hostel is directed by Eli Roth and stars Jay Hernandez, Derek Richardson, and Eythor Gudjonsson. The film takes place in modern day Europe.The film begins with a shot of a torture chamber and then cuts to two Americans, Paxton and Josh (Hernandez and Richardson), and an Icelandic man, Oli (Gudjonsson), in Amsterdam. After being locked out of the hostel they are staying at they are brought in by a young man who claims that there is a much better hostel in Slovakia, with all the best girls and no other Americans. So the three decide to travel to the hostel by train and on the way they encounter a middle aged man who creeps Josh out by touching his leg, and at the time he seems to have no significance. When they arrive at the hostel they discover that everything they heard about it was true and their roommates are two beautiful women (who they get to know quite well). But little do they know everything is not what it seems...The writing of this film was quite ingenious. It reminded me a lot of a Hitchcock film because it really focused on characterization for around the first thirty minutes before focusing on the plot. By the time the plot actually came around I felt that I knew the two main characters Paxton and Josh very well and rooted for them when the film turned into horror. The actual screenplay was quite original I have never seen anything quite like it and I enjoyed how realistic the film was. At points there were noticeable coincidences but not so unrealistic that it ruined the whole film. Eli Roth proves with this film that he is a great addition to the horror genre.The direction of the film was also very good. Along with the writing it really helped develop the characterization and it also kept the film interesting the whole way through. Roth created an extremely gory film and he succeeded in making me flinch at the screen by the brutality. This is one of the goriest films of all time and Roth did it all necessarily, by necessarily I mean he never overdid it just for the scares. This is Roth's second feature film (his first being Cabin Fever) and he proves with it that he is a director that is going to stay around for a while.The acting in this film is quite good as well. Hernandez is the lead and starts off as an enjoyable, relaxed guy. As the film goes on he evolves due to the circumstances he is into a much darker person that is confused, in pain, and angry. He plays his part very well and is very convincing. Richardson plays Josh and is probably the most relatable character in the film. He just got out of a serious relationship and is just looking for a good time. He is a genuinely nice guy who gets into tragic circumstances and I rooted for him the whole time. Gudjonsson plays the part of Oli, he is basically just there for comic relief and he is pretty funny, so good job to you. This is a well acted film.Overall I give this film a strong 7/10, due to the fine acting, direction, and writing. This film is definitely one of the best American horror films of the past decade, along with Saw and 28 Days Later. I can't really think of any other ones at the moment. Another thing I really liked about this film is how it is divided into two parts and how they are separated. The first part is the pretty part with all the girls and drugs, you can tell this part by how the two roommate girls are very attractive and wearing makeup. The second part is the not so pretty part and the two roommates are not wearing makeup during this part. I would recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of the horror genre.",8,1,2,24 August 2010
127 Hours," James Franco Vs. Nature
","The drama 127 Hours is directed by Danny Boyle and starring James Franco, Kate Mara, and Amber Tamblyn. The film takes place in 2003 in Moab, Utah.Aron Ralston (Franco) is a mountain climber who decides to go to the place in Moab, Utah where he has the whole course memorized for his daily thrill. While bike riding, walking, and running around he meets up with two girls Kristi (Mara) and Megan (Tamblyn) and for a short while the three of them go climbing and swimming and all that crazy stuff. Well after the girls leave he gets himself into quite a predicament. While jumping onto a branch he slips and knocks a rock down which crushes his right arm. Oops. The rest of the film is about hallucinations he is having and flashbacks to his family and an old girlfriend. That's why I don't mountain climb, I just write film reviews so I can't my arm crushed.The screenplay by Simon Beaufoy and Danny Boyle was pretty good. This film could have been equally torturous for the viewer as it was for Aron Ralston but it didn't really drag on for the full length of the film, it flowed nicely. The problem with a true story is that the second you go in there you know how it's going to end so the whole time I was like none of this matters I know what's going to happen. I did not see the need to put the flashbacks of his girlfriend in there because it never led up to anything, it didn't even really help with characterization it just showed that Ralston once had a girlfriend but now he's trapped in a canyon. The dialogue for the whole of the film was very believable, usually when one person is talking to themselves it doesn't work out very well but here it works very nicely.Danny Boyle had some pretty stylized direction on this one, and it helped keep the film entertaining throughout. Is this film as good as his previous, Slumdog Millionaire? No. Personally I believe Boyle's best film to be Trainspotting which also had a lot of style and I think Boyle is much more comfortable with stylistic films than something which cannot have a stylistic influence upon it. I like how Boyle does films in multiple genres: Slumdog Millionaire-fantasy, Trainspotting-crime, 28 Days Later-horror, Sunshine-science fiction, and 127 Hours-real life drama. All of Boyles directing decisions I think were fine with this film, the only reason I couldn't give it a higher score is because the story is very limited to a guy trapped in a rock and he couldn't really put in any crazy mind games to add another layer of interest.James Franco easily gave the best performance of his career so far and it would be shocking if he did not receive an Oscar nomination for Best Actor at this year's Academy Awards. Will he win it? I highly doubt it. In the film Aron Ralston is fun, carefree kind of guy who climbs mountains to just to have a good time. When he gets trapped he starts to lose hope and his mind a bit. The part where Franco delivers his best in the film is when he is pretending to interview himself because it just shows how low he has gotten. This is the first time Franco has ever really been in a lead role, I know him mostly for his supporting roles in Spiderman and Pineapple Express, but as a lead man he is very impressive and has a bright career in front of him.The only real supporting cast in this film was Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn as the two girls Ralston meets before he gets trapped. Both girls did a fine job but nothing really noteworthy. They were basically just average girls who are just following a path for fun. There wasn't really enough acting in the flashbacks to criticize but none of them were bad enough to notice.Overall I give this film a 7/10, the only reason I couldn't give it higher was because the script was very limiting and I already knew how it would end since it is a famous story. If you like films like Into the Wild or other man vs. nature type films then you would like this one as well. Franco and Boyle both have very bright careers for the future even though they both had very successful careers before this Franco will make his way as a leading man and Boyle will still be one of the best directors of today.",7,8,18,11 December 2010
Zodiac," A Killer Good Film
","The crime thriller Zodiac is directed by David Fincher and stars Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, and Robert Downey Jr. The film takes place in San Francisco in the 70s for the most part.The film starts off with a brutal murder scene of a young married woman and what looks like a teenage boy by a man that we are not able to see. The man then calls in the murder to the police describing how he did it, but the young teenage boy was left alive. Then at the San Francisco Chronicle, and other locations a coded message was sent from the killer stating how if his letter was not published he would kill more people. After some other similar messages the killer starts to identify himself as Zodiac. Robert Graysmith (Gyllenhaal) is a cartoonist at the San Francisco Chronicle and becomes obsessed with the Zodiac and tries to discover the true identity of the Zodiac along with the police.The screenplay for this film by James Vanderbilt is quite intriguing. I love the way it chronicles the events of the Zodiac murders throughout the 70s and also the intensity of the film. At some points it is a violent murder scene at others it is characters telling little jokes to each other. All of the characters seemed very realistic, I cannot even think of any sort of stock character in the film at all. The film is quite long but the writing keeps it interesting the whole way through.David Fincher's direction is great as always. I think the scenes he shines the most in are the murder scenes. He really knows how to build up the suspense to the murder that the audience knows is going to happen. The two best violent scenes are the ones with the couple in the park and the woman and her baby on the highway. Another fantastic scene was when Zodiac calls up Melvin Belli. The heavy breathing and his scream just built up the creepiness of his character to a new level. Fincher gets great performances from all his leads as well for the most part. Compared to his past films I would say this is not as good as Se7en or Fight Club but it is a much smarter film.The acting in this film was good not great. Gyllenhaal was Robert Graysmith and I would have to say he gave the best performance of the film being very likable and yet I understand how he is flawed by his obsession of the Zodiac. It is not as good as many of his past performances like his in Brokeback Mountain or even really Donnie Darko but it was still a fine performance. Mark Ruffalo gives my favorite performance of his to date in this film. Now personally I do not think Ruffalo is the greatest actor in the world but he is always relatable and the average guy which he is also in this film. Robert Downey Jr.'s performance I thought was pretty weak as Paul Avery. It is basically him just spewing witty dialogue for the whole film and I never really care for his character. Maybe you are supposed to dislike his character but I really did not feel anything for him at all. The rest of the supporting cast gave solid performances, especially those involved in violent scenes.Overall I give this film an 8/10. I would recommend it to anyone who likes dark and historical films.",8,0,0,3 October 2010
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Absolutely Hilarious
","The war comedy Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is directed by Stanley Kubrick and stars Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, and Sterling Hayden. The film takes place in planes over Russia, the war room, and in an American base.Brigadier General Jack Ripper (Hayden) made the insane notion of dropping a nuclear weapon onto Russia during the Cold War. President Muffley (Sellers) must try and calm down the Russian President and make him understand that this attack was not planned by America just one crazy general. General Turgidson (Scott) tries to convince the President that maybe the attack isn't a terrible idea while spewing anti communist insults to the Russian Ambassador that is present in the war room. But the Russian Ambassador reveals that if Russia is attacked by a nuclear weapon a doomsday device will automatically go off destroying the entire world...The screenplay by Peter George, Terry Southern, and Stanley Kubrick is one of the greatest comedic screenplays of all time. Probably my favorite scene of the film is when the President is on the phone with the Russian President for the first time. The back and forth between the two is comedic genius and is humor that everyone can enjoy. Another comedic part I thought was quite hilarious was the classic line when the President told General Turgidson when he was attacking the Russian Ambassador that there is no fighting in the war room. My only problem with the screenplay was that it took a while to get into the film, by that I mean the introduction to the film was not as strong as the middle and end of it. But besides that this film is absolutely hilarious.Stanley Kubrick directed this classic comedy and he did so brilliantly. His last film was the controversial Lolita and he goes to what could have been an extremely controversial film about the cold war if it wasn't comedic gold. There are many iconic shots in this film, the first that comes to mind is the shot of the entire board room. It is a simple shot but it is beautifully composed. I have to say it is hard to find a shot in this film, or any Kubrick film really, that is not masterfully done. Besides the great shots he got great performances from his entire cast.Peter Sellers played three roles in this film, the president, Dr. Strangelove, and Group Captain Lionel Mandrake. In all three of those roles he used his comedic talents to make this film as great as it is. Sellers worked with Kubrick previously in Lolita and in both films he was absolutely wonderful. Above I mentioned the president and the Russian president's phone conversation, well that could not have been so hilarious without Sellers's great voice and facial expressions. Then when he is Dr. Strangelove he again uses his voice talents to win over many laughs. Sellers proves with this film that he is one of the greatest comedic forces of all time.George C. Scott was also fantastic as General Turgidson, delivering plenty of laughs as well. My favorite scene with Scott was when he was explaining what was happening to the president. How he tried to make himself look like he could save the situation was just uproariously funny. He is an extraordinary actor overall, one of my favorite films features him in the Best Picture winner Patton where he also wins an Oscar for Best Actor. I would say that in this film Scott does an equally well done job as Sellers, which is saying a lot for the both of them.Sterling Hayden has worked with Kubrick before in The Killing and in this film he delivers a fine performance as the insane General Jack Ripper. He delivers many great lines about fluids that guarantees a couple of chuckles from the audience. Hayden works quite well off of Sellers as Group Captain Lionel Mandrake. I loved it when Hayden takes the machine gun and shoots it out the window out his fellow Americans.Overall I give this film a 9/10, due to its great script, direction, and performances. I recommend this film to absolutely everyone, even those people that don't have an interest in film and just want to have a good time. This film features a great ending that is extremely hilarious as well. If you haven't seen this classic, go get it. Right now.",9,1,2,11 December 2010
The Town," The Town Proves Affleck is a Force to be Reckoned With
","The crime drama The Town is directed by Ben Affleck and stars Ben Affleck, Rebecca Hall, Jon Hamm, and Jeremy Renner. The film takes place in modern day Charlestown, Massachusetts.The film starts off with four men preparing to rob a bank and they are lead by Doug MacRay (Affleck). They quickly take all the money and leave all the tracers behind and do a nice and easy job. Then the group takes the bank manager, Claire Keesey (Hall), hostage and bring her into their van. Then they drop her off at a beach and drive away. Afterwards the group discovers that the FBI is searching for them and have contacted Claire. So Doug follows Claire and then eventually talks to her at a Laundromat. They soon develop a romantic relationship. The rest of the film follows how the group does more bank robberies, while the FBI is trying to catch them and Doug and Claire's relationship gets more complex.The screenplay for this film was very good. It was constantly entertaining and was extremely realistic. There was not one point in this film where I said ooh that would never happen, they just did it to build up the drama. All the characters had quite a bit of depth to them and were all pretty relatable. One could say that Jeremy Renner and Jon Hamm's characters were stock characters but then again there are plenty of people like them. I was not a giant fan of the ending but I was satisfied with it. Also I enjoyed how there were so many bits of comic relief in here that just made it seem even more realistic.Ben Affleck has been called the new Clint Eastwood, and to tell you the truth I think he might just be. Obviously it is not yet proved since he has only directed two films, but both of them are superb. Affleck got many memorable performances from his cast, even though he was busy being a member of the cast as well. Also Affleck had many complex shots that built up the tension. One of my favorite sequences in the film is with the group of robbers in the nun outfit and the police officer who sees them. I won't give away what happens but it was filmed brilliantly.The acting in this film was great by almost everyone in the whole cast. Ben Affleck delivered his best performance yet in my opinion as the troubled bank robber who wants to end his ways and live a simple, happy life. The reason he probably gave such a brilliant performance was because he directed and co wrote the film so he knew exactly what he wanted. Rebecca Hall was also great as the bank manager who has a relationship with Doug. She was just a normal girl but was just so likable because of her innocence, I may say this is my favorite role of hers as well even though I haven't seen much of her work. Jeremy Renner gives another great performance as the on edge bank robber. Even though his character is a stock character in a way he just played the part perfectly. I can't say the same for Jon Hamm though because I think he just played the role as lead detective like any actor would. He did not add a sense of realism to his role. Blake Lively had a small part of the drug addicted sister of Jeremy Renner's character and gave a solid performance as well proving that she can be a serious actress. Chris Cooper is always great even though he was only in the film for one scene being Doug's father.Overall I give this film a strong 8/10. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a smart crime drama. I am also proud to say that this is my favorite film of the year so far. I know what many of you are saying when you read this, what about Inception and Toy Story 3? Well to that I say neither of those films seems as real and full of emotion as this one. Yes, they are both fine films but this one is just more to my liking. I understand why the rest of you would like the other two better but the more I think about those two the more I dislike them even though I still do like them. Watch this film, it is the best bank robbery film in years.",8,5,9,26 September 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," One of the Weakest of the Series
","The fantasy film Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is directed by David Yates and stars Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint. The film takes place all over the wizarding world.In the first part of the final chapter of the hit series Harry Potter (Radcliffe), Hermione Granger (Watson), and Ron Weasley (Grint) are trying to form a plan with the group known as the Order of the Phoenix to overcome Lord Voldemort (Fiennes) and the rest of the death eaters. When the group is attacked by the death eaters they find themselves on the run while trying to find the horcruxes which can be used to destroy Lord Voldemort. Tensions grow between the three teens while they are searching for the horcruxes. Will they find all the horcruxes and make the wizarding world safe? You won't find out in this one but you will in the next one.The screenplay by Steve Kloves based on the world wide bestselling novels was poor because the film does not stand out on its own. I have not seen the last Harry Potter film since it was in theatres so I don't really remember all the details. But besides that it was a pretty basic film plot wise. Wizards attacked, on the run and in hiding, search for objects to destroy evil, get attacked along the way, and then get ready for the sequel. Now let me just say right now that I have not read the books and I'm not a die-hard fan of the series so don't hate me forever because I am writing a negative review about this film. Most great sequels or even decent sequels someone can go in and watch and enjoy without seeing the earlier films. If we look to this summer's Toy Story 3 it was a very good film that you did not really need to see the other films to enjoy it.David Yates direction on the other hand was pretty good. He had some very nice shots the whole way through, I can see him in the future on a different project getting some Oscar attention. I really liked the way he opened the film with a close up on the minister of magic's eyes and then all the cameras flashing taking a picture of him. Also, when Hermione was telling the legend of the three brothers I liked how he switched a Corpse Bride like animation technique, it was very effective and interesting. It reminded me a little of how a character in Kill Bill: Vol. 1 was telling a story and Tarantino decided to make it animated. Yates didn't get the greatest performances from his actors though.The acting in this film was mediocre, even though some supporting characters were able to give a nice performance. All three leads, Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint, did a decent job but nothing that will make me believe that they will remain stars after the series come to an end. The only one of the three that I think has a chance is Emma Watson because she gives the best performance of them in all the films and Radcliffe and Grint have a very unique look that will only work for a limited selection of films. Everyone in this film who established their career from other films such as Ralph Fiennes, Helena Bonham Carter, and Brendan Gleeson, did a fine job with their very unique and in Carter and Gleeson's cases corky characters. I would have mentioned Alan Rickman as well but in this film his part only lasts around five minutes.The score by Alexandre Desplat was great as it is in all of the Harry Potter films. It added another layer to what was happening on the screen allowing the audience to get deeper into the film. The classical melodies are always great and I personally like a film better when they decide to make their musical classical rather than a non orchestrated score.Overall I give this film a 5/10. If I was to watch the first six films before this one than walk into the theatre I would have probably have given this a 6 or maybe even a 7. The main problem of this film is that it does not stand on its own unlike many great sequels over history such as The Godfather Part II, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, The Dark Knight, Toy Story 3, or any of the Lord of the Rings or Star Wars (original) sequels. I still recommend this film to Harry Potter fans and I hope that you enjoy it.",5,2,4,27 November 2010
Knowing," A Film That Already Seems Like You Know It
","Knowing is a science fiction disaster movie directed by Alex Proyas and stars Nicolas Cage, Rose Byrne, and Chandler Canterbury. The film takes place in modern day New York state.The films starts off in an elementary school in 1959 with a little girl Lucinda. Lucinda is haunted by voices she is hearing in her head and when her teacher asks her and the rest of her class to draw their picture of the future for a time capsule she just writes a lot of meaningless numbers (or are they?). Later that day Lucinda goes missing for a while but then she is found by her teacher in a closet where she clawed some last numbers on the door. Then it is cut to present day where the time capsule is taken out of the ground and John Koestler's (Cage) son, Caleb (Canterbury), gets Lucinda's page of numbers from the time capsule. John accidentally discovers that some of these numbers are the date of 9/11 and the exact number of people killed then (It's a good thing he discovered this or else it would just be a movie about how Nicolas Cage needs to get a haircut). After a while John comes to the conclusion that there are three more disasters left on the list and the last one is, ooh my, the end of the world! The acting in this film was dreadful. The best of them was the Oscar winner Nicolas Cage who was somewhat decent as John Koestler. He really brought nothing to the table as the lead and basically read the lines and put on a concerned face. Rose Byrne plays the mother of a girl that can also here the whispers that Lucinda and Caleb can hear and she was terrible, so much so that I grew to hate her as the film went on. She was just made terrible decisions when the film lead you to believe that she was a somewhat intelligent woman. Her acting made her unlikable though. I am not going to say anything bad about the child actors, but none of them were as good as Haley Joel Osment.The screenplay for this film was just so typical. I felt like I saw it already a hundred times and every supposed twist was a yawn. It was entirely predictable, I always knew the next step. I may have not known the next step after that but it was soon made clear before I reached it. This is the screenwriters first big film but that doesn't mean it has to be as bad as this.Overall I give this film a solid 4/10 due to its poor acting, weak script, and below par direction. I would recommend this film to fans of the sci-fi and disaster genre.",4,0,4,23 August 2010
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Your usual love story with a lot of style
","Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World is directed by Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz) and stars Michael Cera ( Superbad, Arrested Development) and Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Death Proof, Live Free or Die Hard). The film takes place in modern day in Toronto, Canada and the genre I would say is a fantasy/rom-com AKA fantaromcom.The film is about how a boy, Scott Pilgrim (Cera), who is depressed due to the fact that he still really likes a girl who broke up with him a year ago and currently is dating a 17 year old high school girl. But then he sees a girl, Ramona Flowers (Winstead), who he instantly is attacted to and is obsessed with. Little does he know though is that in order for him to date Ramona Flowers he has to defeat, not fight but defeat, her seven evil ex boyfriends (and one happens to be a girl, ooh my). As the film goes on he has to balance his romantic life with his band and also has to have many fights (who new Michael Cera was the next Arnold Schwarzenegger?). Don't forget about his high school girlfriend though, who in my opinion is the best part of the film.The first aspect of the filmmaking I want to talk about is the writing. It is an extremely traditional storyline with a little spice in it. It was boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back. Extremely predictable. The only thing different is the obstacle Scott Pilgrim had to go through was to defeat the seven evil ex boyfriends and that was pretty straight forward (just extremely stylized). This film was not very funny. The only funny parts of the movie were with Scott Pilgrim's Asian girlfriend. Also, it was very unrealistic how Scott Pilgrim just happened to be such a talented fighter, at least if after the first fight he made a little joke that he used to take Karate it would have been better. Edgar Wright's previous films Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz were much better written because they were so clever, but then again those films had actual funny people, not Michael Cera. Maybe Wright should stick to spoofs when he writes.The direction of this film was the strongest part of the film. While the writing was boring and the comedy was weak there was some very interesting special effects to watch during the fight scenes and all the little captions that came up were interesting. This film was extremely stylized and it truly overpowered the writing of the film. Edgar Wright proves that he is a noteworthy director, but has not yet proved that he is a great one.The acting in this film was subpar, Cera proved that he can only play one part for the rest of his life and will stick with it. Winstead did nothing special just reading her lines with a not caring tone. Chris Evans gave a good performance for his minor role as Lucas Lee, the second evil ex-boyfriend, being like a Steven Seagal like actor. All the other supporting characters acted decently no one really stole the movie maybe the Asian girlfriend did a little better than decent.Overall, this film is not very good a weak 5/10 I give it. The only reason I don't give it a 4 is because of the direction by Edgar Wright, he was very good at that. I'd recommend this film to those who enjoy comic book adaptations, fans of Michael Cera, and those who like extremely stylized films.",5,8,22,18 August 2010
No Country for Old Men," A Film That Will Keep You on the Edge of Your Seat
","The suspense, western, drama No Country for Old Men is directed by the Coen brothers and stars Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, and Tommy Lee Jones. The film takes place in 1980 Texas.The film starts off with a man, Anton Chigurh (Bardem), being arrested. He is then brought to the police station and the officer who arrested him is on the phone. He is able to get his handcuffs under his legs and then brutally strangles the officer to death and frees himself, steals a police car, kills another person and steals their car. Then it cuts to Llewelyn Moss (Brolin) hunting deer. While checking to see if he hits one he notices an arranged of vehicles in a field. He goes over and sees that there has been a large gunfight and finds a lot of drugs in the back of one of the trucks. Soon he finds a satchel that contains two million dollars inside of it. The rest of the film is about how Moss tries to make it away with the money while being chased by Chigurh and while Chigurh is being chased by a local sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Jones).The screenplay for this film was excellent. It was extremely suspenseful and all the main characters had great depth to them. Anton Chigurh will be a character like Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver that will be remembered for a very long time. Also I thought the ending was very deep, along with the rest of the film. Personally it is my favorite Coen brother film I have seen, but I still have to see a good amount of their films.The direction of this film was excellent and it well deserved the Oscar for it. To make a film this suspenseful without the use of music is extremely difficult and the Coens pull it off brilliantly. It is an edge of your seat film for the older generation, not just for the teens like most of the suspense films that come out these days. The Coens have proved yet again that they can get brilliant performances out of their actors. Truly an amazing job in the direction department.The acting for this film was as well brilliant. Josh Brolin played the lead and it truly brought him to now become one of the biggest actors in Hollywood. He was a stubborn Texas man that just wasn't going to quit and he was absolutely perfect. Javier Bardem delivered one of the greatest performances of the decade in his role and will go down in history for it. He deserved that Oscar so much that they shouldn't have even nominated anyone else in the category. Jones played his part fine, it just seems that he is a police officer in every movie and it is pretty annoying. This is an excellently acted film.Overall I give this film a 9/10, and I have no complaints with it winning the Best Picture Oscar, even though I like There Will be Blood more. I would recommend this one for anyone who likes great suspense films.",9,2,4,13 September 2010
Cars," Another Enjoyable Film From Pixar
","The animated family film Cars is directed by John Lasseter and stars Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, and Bonnie Hunt. The film takes place in modern day world that is ruled by cars instead of humans.The film starts off with Lightning McQueen (Wilson) preparing for a big race. McQueen is a car that is very self absorbed, hard to get along with, and all he wants to do is win. He is in a race with a total of forty three cars to win the acclaimed Piston Cup. After refusing to get his tires changed at a pit stop they fly off right on the last lap of the race and McQueen's two biggest competitors Chick Hicks and The King end up in a tie with him for the win. Because of the tie there has to be a race between the three of them to gain the Piston Cup and if McQueen wins he would be sponsored by the great Dynaco. But as his truck is taking him to the race in California McQueen falls out of the truck and is stuck in a small town, Radiator Springs, as a prisoner because he damaged the road while driving. McQueen must fix the road to be able to make it back to the race, but while in the town he meets some memorable cars like Doc Hudson (Newman), Sally Carrera (Hunt), and Mater (Larry the Cable Guy).The writing for this film was very original and was a light enjoyable film. Unlike many of the other Pixar films this one does not have a great sense of depth or an underlying message. Yet it is easy to watch and will keep you entertained which is not an easy feat. It was somewhat corny but not so much that it was ridiculous to watch and it is a kid's film so you can't really expect for something drastically different. Now while watching this film I thought to myself that they made Toy Story again but instead of Toys or even bugs from A Bug's Life they used cars instead. I wonder how many films Lasseter can create that are about different sorts of inanimate objects or creatures other than humans.The direction of this film I thought was quite good. Lasseter truly made a pleasant film with some nice performances from the whole cast. I really liked the shots he had at the beginning and towards the end of when the cars are speeding by in the race. Also I enjoyed all the shots of Lightning McQueen getting his photo taken. Lasseter makes many pleasurable films and this one is not an exception.I know I have been using the word pleasurable a lot during this review so I will switch it up and say that the acting was as well delightful. Owen Wilson played McQueen and he did a fine job, it was nothing special but nothing special was really required. Paul Newman played the part of Doc Hudson and he was as well fine in his last feature film. I don't know if that is how he really sounds in real life but if not then he did a good job with his voice for the part. Bonnie Hunt was average as the love interest Sally Carrera, her part was no different really than any generic love interest. Larry the Cable Guy really brought a nice warm feeling to the film as the rusty pickup truck Mater with his comedic lines. Mater was definitely my favorite character of the film.Overall I give this film a weak 7/10. I would recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of Pixar and enjoys family films.",5,1,2,7 September 2010
The Elephant Man," Lynch Transforms a Great Book Into a Great Film
","The biographic drama The Elephant Man is directed by David Lynch and stars Anthony Hopkins, John Hurt, and Anne Bancroft. The film takes place in nineteenth century London.When Dr. Frederick Treves (Hopkins) goes to a circus, or to better say it a freak show, he stumbles upon an act that is titled the Elephant Man. He discovers the most hideously fascinating human being he had ever come upon in his entire life and wanted to study the deformed human to discover why he is the way he is. The owner of the man, Mr. Bytes, claims that his mother was raped by an elephant and that is why the Elephant Man is so monstrously deformed. Treves makes an agreement with Bytes to take the Elephant Man back to the hospital to do research on him so he can make a presentation to build his medical career for the Pathological Society. But as time goes on Treves realize that the Elephant Man is not an animal, he is a human, a human named John Merrick (Hurt). Merrick can speak, and read, and do anything mentally that a normal person can do yet his deformities make him unable to function in society. Can John Merrick live a happy life where he isn't abused, or will society not let him? The screenplay by David Lynch, Christopher De Vore and Eric Bergren was superbly crafted and very loyal to the book by the same name. The film is just a fascinating biography about someone who suffered so much in their life and how I as an audience member just want John Merrick to experience just a shred of joy in his life. The characterization of both John Merrick and Frederick Treves were brilliant, by the time I was half way through the film I knew each character and that allowed me to feel for them. There is really nothing wrong with the screenplay at all, no complaints here.David Lynch ploys his crazy directing style from the second the film starts with a flashing screen of a woman being raped and elephant sounds being heard. Personally I believe that Lynch is one of the greatest directors of all time and he definitely proves it yet again with this film. I love the way he takes simple shots of a street, it looks like a photograph that would be on a cover of a magazine. What is also great about Lynch's style is that if someone put a film in front of you within moments you could tell that he directed it because he is one of the few directors that have such a noticeable style. Alright, I sound like a little school girl. Besides the brilliance of all the shots in the film Lynch got great performances from his whole cast. Yet again, Lynch proves he is a directing force to be reckoned with.The editing for this film by Anne V. Coates I have some likes and some dislikes. Let's start with the likes. I really like the sounds put over the film to add an effect of creepiness to it, they appear in many of Lynch's films and I always love them. I think the way all the shots are organized is great but there are too many fade to blacks in this film. It sort of segments it and makes it tiring to watch. After every scene about there is one and it just doesn't feel necessary, a simple dissolve or another technique could be used that does not push the viewer out of the film.The acting in this film is very good, with a great performance from John Hurt. Hurt received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor which he very much deserved. If this movie came out in a different year he probably would have won it but he unfortunately was up against Robert De Niro in Raging Bull who delivered a masterful performance. Hurt played John Merrick brilliantly moving and sounding like he was deformed and while doing that he made it so he was a lovable character besides his hideous deformities. I love the scene where he meets Mrs. Treves, it is just so heartwarming and perfect. David Lynch does not make scenes like that anymore. Anthony Hopkins gave a strong performance as Dr. Frederick Treves who wants to be successful while not wanting to take advantage of Merrick. Treves struggle is not as major of an issue as it is in the book but still plays a significant part in the film and Hopkins could not really have done anything to improve it. Anne Bancroft played Mrs. Kendal, an actress of the theatre who visits Merrick in his hospital room. Bancroft plays the part fine but it is nothing too memorable, when thinking about the performances of this film the only person that will be remembered is John Hurt.Overall I give this film a 9/10, it is definitely a great film and one of the best of the 1980's. I would recommend it to anyone who likes David Lynch, moving stories, biographies, the 1800s, never mind I recommend this to everyone. It is always fun watching Anthony Hopkins not be evil. I guarantee that if you enjoy films that are not pure entertainment you will enjoy this masterful piece of art.",9,0,0,20 November 2010
The Game," The Game is Fun but it Isn't Fincher's Best
","The psychological thriller The Game is directed by David Fincher and stars Michael Douglas, Sean Penn, and Deborah Kara Unger. The film takes place in modern day San Francisco.Nicholas Van Orten (Douglas) is a very successful business man who lives alone and is very depressed. He used to be married and does not have a very close relationship with his brother, Conrad (Penn). On Nicholas's birthday he remembers how his father killed himself when he turned forty eight. But on Nicholas's birthday his brother gives him a gift that is from a company known as Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). What this company provides is a game that will control your life and promises a thrilling experience that you've never felt before. But it gets a little bit too thrilling...John D. Brancato and Michael Ferris wrote the screenplay for this psychological thriller, and it was a little bit too outrageous. It still is a very fun and entertaining ride but it requires you to not think too deeply about what the company needs to be doing for all of this to be happening. I will not go over all the ridiculous things that happen that make this film illogical because there are too many to count, but like I said if you forget about them it is a fun film. Also, this film is purely plot driven, the characters are very one dimensional. In all psychological thrillers there is some sort of twist and in this one there are many as well and they are satisfying, especially the final one. David Fincher is one of the biggest directors of today but this film was only his third feature and it did not have as much intensity and grittiness as his previous film Se7en. None of the shots in this film were all that impressive, but the sequencing of the shots kept me fascinated the whole way through the film. Fincher grew much as a director since this film and I would even claim that he is one of the best of his generation. But this film is not the reason why he is considered that at all, he became a cult favorite from Se7en and Fight Club then went on to start making more wide spread audience films like Zodiac, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and the recent The Social Network. His film repertoire is very impressive and it is enjoyable to see one of his early works such as this film and see how he has grown from it.Michael Douglas plays the lead of Nicholas Van Orten and even though the character is one dimensional he embodies the role quite well. He sort of plays a sad Gordon Gekko but does not have the great lines that Gekko had. He was very believable in the role but again this is not something that he will be remembered for when talking about why Michael Douglas is a very successful actor.Sean Penn does not have a major part in this film but he is still in it for a little bit as Nicholas's brother Conrad. When Nicholas and Conrad are running from the CRS and Conrad has sort of a paranoid nervous breakdown Penn is quite good, even though it is nothing compared to the many brilliant performances of his career. When I think Sean Penn I think Milk, Mystic River, and his comedic performance in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, not this film even though he is good, like Douglas.Deborah Kara Unger plays a waitress named Christine that Nicholas drags into his game. As the film goes on it is hard to determine if she is trying to help Nicholas or if she is working with the CRS. Her performance is alright, but nothing really memorable. I can't even cite a scene in the movie where she was good, it was just her character that was interesting.Overall I give this film a 6/10, because it is a thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the dramatic finale. None of the qualities of the film are great, but they are all decent. I would recommend this to fans of Fincher, psychological thrillers, or I guess dark films with a twist.",6,0,1,12 December 2010
Patton," The Mind of One of the Most Influential Men in History
","The war film Patton is directed by Franklin J. Schaffner and stars George C. Scott and Karl Malden. The film takes place during WWII in Europe and Northern Africa.The film starts off with General Patton (Scott) giving a monologue to his troops in front of a giant American flag about war. It is hard to give a summary of this film because it is about General Patton so instead I will give you a summary of the character. Patton is a legendary man who will be remembered for as long as WWII will be remembered. He is one of the greatest American generals. The film focuses on every aspect of his character. He is a hot headed, stubborn man who will do things his way. He wants all the glory. The most important thing about him though is his love of war. For him war equals happiness. This film is one of the best character studies ever made and it is hard to really call it a war film since there is so little war sequences.The screenplay for this film is absolutely brilliant. It was written by Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North who both deservingly won Oscars. Patton was constantly on the screen for about 90% of the film and for me to keep interested by him the whole time is enough to say that this is an incredibly written film. I also really liked how the Nazis were shown studying Patton so I was also able to know him better. Another great thing was that I grew to really like Patton and yet still dislike his beliefs. That is great writing. Bravo.Schaffner has succeeded in direction one of not only the greatest war films ever, but one of the greatest films. There were so many beautiful complex shots in this film I was in awe constantly. Not only did he direct this film brilliantly but he knew how to get an outstanding performance from his lead actor. I believe that if almost anyone besides Schaffner directed this film it would have been a terrible, boring film that would have been tossed aside during the Oscars even though it had a brilliant screenplay.George C. Scott delivered one of the greatest performances of all time in this film. He was a hated man yet made me grow to love him. Scott made me understand Patton in a way the direction in the writing could not do. It is rarely I leave a film and say to myself I wish I knew this man just to be in the presence of such a complex mind that is truly simple in a way. Karl Malden did a fine job as General Bradley, he was very likable and was perfect for the part. The rest of the supporting cast did a fine job as well.Overall I give this film a 10/10. It is a must see film for anyone who likes character studies, war films, or just an excellently crafted film.",10,1,3,9 September 2010
Donnie Brasco," A Not So Great Mafia Film
","Donnie Brasco stars Al Pacino, Johnny Depp, and Michael Madsen and takes place in 1978 New York and would be categorized under the Mafia genre.The film is about an undercover cop, played by Depp, and his work taking out the Mafia in New York. The film starts out with Donnie Brasco (Depp) at a jeweler and how he is looking at a made man in the mafia, Lefty (Pacino), and Lefty takes him under his wing after one meeting and no background info on Brasco. Brasco then becomes Lefty's right hand man and the two of the work under Sonny Black (Madsen) and do all the usual mafia things. The main struggle of the film is how Brasco has to keep in his undercover while having a family at home and he grows very attached to Lefty as well. This film is a Mafia film with a stronger police part than in other Mafia films such as The Godfather or Goodfellas which is what makes it unique.The Directing in this film was poor for two main reasons. Reason #1 is that as a viewer I felt no attachment to any of the characters. I never cared that Donnie Brasco's normal life was falling apart due to his career, I never cared that his life was in danger due to his career, I never really cared about his career. Nor did I care about how Lefty wasn't being taken seriously anymore and was passed up for promotion. Reason #2 why I thought the direction was poor is because these men are in the Mafia they are powerful men and the direction did nothing to show that it just made them look like a normal person which in my opinion was a mistake. If this movie was better directed it could of easily been considered a great film.The acting in this film was decent, the best performance being by Depp. This is his biggest early role in his career that he did not work with Tim Burton and he proved here he can act well without being such an odd character which I truly enjoyed. But again as I said in the previous paragraph I felt no connection to him which is not entirely his fault but still. Pacino I thought was not very good in this film he always seemed on the same emotional level and just was sad, really I thought nothing special. Madsen I thought was very good in this film as Sonny Black. He did great portraying himself as a tough, impulsive Mafia boss and every time he was on the screen was extremely enjoyable. Now was he as good as he was in Reservoir Dogs, no. But still he is an actor that I wish I could see more of.The score of this film I thought was inappropriate. It sounded like music that would be used in a drama, not a Mafia film and this often distracted me and annoyed me. I really thought this was a mistake.My overall reaction to this film is that it is not very good, a strong 5/10 I would say. It had potential to be much better in my opinion. I'm not going to tell you to stay away from this film because it is pretty well reviewed I would recommend this film to those who enjoy Mafia films, just go in knowing that this is no Goodfellas or The Godfather.",5,5,10,18 August 2010
Mulholland Drive," David Lynch Likes to Play With Your Mind
","The psychological thriller Mulholland Dr. is directed by David Lynch and stars Naomi Watts, Laura Harring, and Justin Theroux. The film takes place in modern day Hollywood.A young woman Rita (Harring) is in a limousine that gets crashed into by a bunch of crazy kids driving and loses her memory. She wanders around the streets of Hollywood until she enters an apartment complex while the residents of the apartment she goes into are leaving. Then the apartment owners niece, Bette (Watts), stays at the apartment hoping to become a movie star. When Bette finds Rita she tries to help her discover who she really is and go around Los Angeles looking for clues. Adam Kesher (Theroux) is a film director and is being forced by some unknown threatening people to cast an actress into the lead role of his new film. Adam is very angry by this and goes home early to discover that his wife is cheating on him with Billy Ray Cyrus. Adam has much bigger problems than that though because he is being followed by some very bad people...The writing by David Lynch for this film is masterful. This film is completely unique and no other writer can write like Lynch. Everything about this crazy, twisted film is pure genius, what I love about it most is the first time that I saw it I was thinking the whole time this movie seems really bad but I can't stop watching because I secretly love it. The complexity of the plot is so complex that no one has even found out how complex it is yet. Just a brilliant script and if you see this film you are either going to love it or hate it. And if you watch it and you like it then it just hasn't sunk in yet that you actually love it.David Lynch's direction is as insane as his writing, and that is obviously a good thing. The shots are absolutely stunning, and this is one of the few films I find addicting. After I watched this film the first time I said to myself I must watch something else of David Lynch's direction. He really knows how to get great performances from his actors, and a lot of people say they are acting poorly but they are supposed to be and they are doing it extremely well.As I said in the last paragraph the acting was really good, but easily the weakest part of the film. Naomi Watts made me love her after seeing this movie because she is just so good the whole way through, I would elaborate more on it but that would kind of give spoilers. Laura Harring was alright, nothing too special though but she wasn't really supposed to be. There was nothing wrong with her performance though but she could have added a little more depth to it. The same really goes for Justin Theroux as well, he did fine but he could have added more. The supporting cast all did great, giving exactly as they were supposed to and supplying a lot of mystery with their performances.Overall I give this film a solid 9/10. It is a must see for anyone who wants to get their mind bended, much more than this summer's Inception. After you see this film I suggest you see Lynch's Inland Empire which will completely destroy your mind, I still have no clue what that film is even about.",9,3,5,16 October 2010
The Graduate," A Dramedy Classic
","The dramedy The Graduate is a film from director Mike Nichols and stars Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft, and Katharine Ross and takes place in modern day Pasadena, California.The film is about a young man, Ben (Hoffman), who just graduate college and is worried very much so about his future. But at his party to celebrate his graduation one his parent's friends, Mrs. Robinson (Bancroft), lures Ben to her home and tries to seduce Ben. At first she doesn't succeed, but then Ben finally calls her up and takes her offer. Their affair goes on for quite a bit until Ben just wants to talk to Mrs. Robinson for once instead of just having sex. Then Elaine (Ross), Mrs. Robinson's daughter, comes home from Berkley and she and Ben start to date. The tension builds rapidly and emotions begin to fly in this classic film.Mike Nichols deserves his Oscar for Best Director because of all the legendary shots in this film. There are so many, the first that comes to mind is when Ben says, 'Mrs. Robinson, are you trying to seduce me?'. Another is when he is in his scuba suit. I can go on and on about the amazing number of brilliant shots. Another thing he did very well was make us connect to the characters, especially Ben and Elaine. I could feel Ben's nervousness when Mrs. Robinson is playing her little game with him and I could feel Elaine's humiliation when she was brought to the strip club.The whole cast gave fantastic performances. Dustin Hoffman developed the character into a true human that anyone could relate to by being nerdy, curious, and very stubborn. Anne Bancroft brought most of the laughs to the film in her iconic role as Mrs. Robinson. She was cold yet desirable and did a brilliant job of playing a woman tortured by her mistakes during her life. Katharine Ross was the girl next door and was absolutely wonderful, she was the girl that everyone would want to marry and will always be remembered for her performance in this film.The score of this film is just as legendary as the film itself. With music from the band Simon & Garfunkel, such as Sounds of Silence and the iconic song Mrs. Robinson. The music was perfect for the film and will always be something that the film will be recognized for.Overall this is a great film, I would say a weak 9/10 just because it is slow at some parts. I would have to say I would recommend this film to everyone, I personally believe this is a film that everyone must see before they die.",9,1,1,20 August 2010
The Descent," One of the Best Horror Films of the Past Decade That Will Make You Never Want To Go in a Cave Again
","The horror film The Descent is written and directed by Neil Marshall and stars Shauna Macdonald, Natalie Jackson Mendoza, and Alex Reid. The film takes place in modern day and mostly in a cavern.Sarah's (Macdonald) husband and daughter died tragically in a car accident on the way home from a river kayaking trip with some other friends. A year later when Sarah is more stable her group of friends decide to go on an adventure like they used to so she could feel better and pretend things are back to normal. The group decides to go on a caving decision and Juno (Mendoza) does not tell anyone that the cave that they are going to had never been explored. Juno did this so that they can name the cave after Sarah. While exploring the cave it begins to fall in and the group becomes trapped inside. If that isn't scary enough they are being tracked by murderous monsters...Neil Marshall's screenplay is solid even though I have a few problems with it. What makes most horror movies great is the characterization in them. In this though all the characters are one dimensional, even Sarah. All I really know about Sarah is that her family was killed in a car accident and that makes her sad. But that is more than I know about the other characters. I did like though the idea of being isolated in a cave, that can be a horror movie on its own. But to be followed by monsters who try to kill you? That is just another layer of horror. The end of this film is brilliant as well and Neil Marshall should be proud of writing one of the best horror films of the past decade. Make sure if you watch this you watch the original uncut version though not the American one.The direction of this film by Neil Marshall was perfect for a horror film as well. Those shots in the cave where Holly was squeezing through the walls were just perfect to let the viewer know just how isolated they were. Marshall I guess got good performances out of his actors even though I never really knew them. The scares in the film were all basically jump scares nothing to keep you unable to sleep that night, even though there is a lot of psychological things you could be scared of during this film.The acting in this film was mediocre, nothing to write home about. It wasn't really that any of the actors gave bad performances it was just that there was not enough character for them to act off of. No one was by any means bad and everyone was believable when they were scared it was just no sense of character, so I cannot really judge it.Overall I give this film a 7/10 because it is a very effective horror film. If there was thirty minutes of the girls all in the cabin talking so the audience could get more of a sense of who they are I would probably have given this an 8/10. But my major complaint with this film is the lack of characterization so that is why I give it what I give it. If you like horror films you should definitely see this, especially ones when people are trapped in dark places with monsters lurching around all over the place.",7,0,4,14 November 2010
Hoosiers," Another Corny Sports Film
","The sports film Hoosiers is directed by David Anspaugh and stars Gene Hackman, Barbara Hershey, and Dennis Hopper. The film takes place in 1951 Indiana.The film starts off with Norman Dale (Hackman) coming to a high school in Indiana to coach the team and also teach. He is not welcomed very warmly by the town because of how they are not used to change. Dale has not coached basketball for twelve years due to the fact that he was in the marines. At first the basketball season goes quite poorly and everyone in the town thinks that it is because that Jimmy, the town's best player, is not playing on the team because his mother is sick and that his father died. The local drunk of the town, Shooter (Hopper), knows much about the sport and becomes Dale's assistant coach. The two of them try and lead the team to a successful season and maybe a championship. Yippee!The screenplay was written by Angelo Pizzo and is one of the corniest films I have ever seen. How does someone make a true story feel so fake? It feels so formulaic in how that the team is down but then they come up and then they go down again. It seems like Pizzo just read the guidelines for how to make a basic sports film. There was just too much on the side of the sports story that makes it feel fake. For one is how suddenly the coach and Myra Fleener have a relationship out of nowhere and it really has no effect on the film at all. Another is how at every game they win with only three seconds left and it is really lucky. I've seen many basketball games and that really happens. So the screenplay for this film is poor.The direction for this film by Anspaugh was also poor. He helped create the fakeness and corniness that is felt throughout the film. The only thing I can say that he did well was get good performances out of his actors, but I have a feeling that since Hackman and Hopper are some of the greatest actors there are they just gave good performances without the help of Anspaugh. It also annoys how directors think that when they have shots of beautiful scenery it makes them a good director. It is not that hard to do that and it is not something for a director to be proud of.As I said in the last paragraph the acting was pretty good. Hackman played the coach and he gave a funny yet motivational performance and kept the film entertaining. His character did not have that much depth so Hackman couldn't really give that much depth so that is why Hackman couldn't really give a great performance. Hershey's character I truly believed had no purpose in the film besides being an unneeded love interest for the coach and she did not give a memorable performance what so ever. Dennis Hopper is the only one that really shined in this film as the drunk man trying to get his act together to be the assistant coach. When he performed best I believed was when he was forced to coach when Hackman was kicked out and his nervous face was just so funnily brilliant. I think he deserved his Oscar nomination and he made the film.Overall I give this film a 5/10. I would have given it lower if it wasn't for Dennis Hopper's performance. I would recommend this film for anyone who enjoys the sports genre.",5,6,14,6 September 2010
It's a Wonderful Life," One of the Greatest Films Ever Made
","The drama fantasy It's a Wonderful Life is directed by Frank Capra and stars James Stewart, Donna Reed, and Lionel Barrymore and it takes place in a modern day small town.The film starts off with angels talking about how a man, George Bailey (Stewart), needs help to make his life better. The angels decide to send a second class angel, Clarence, to go and help him. But before sending him they give him all the important details of his life. The first one that is shown was when George Bailey was a child and saved his brother's life and stopped the shopkeeper he worked for from selling poison tablets. Then it showed when George Bailey was older and how he dreamed of traveling the world but at any chance he got he had to do some sort of work for the loan shop he was in charge of. He fell in love with a young woman named Mary Hatch (Donna Reed) but struggled to gain her as his wife. This film is excellent and has a morale that everyone needs to hear, a timeless classic.Frank Capra directed this film brilliantly. It was truly sentimental and he made it so you could feel the emotions of George Bailey. There were quite a few classic moments that he created in this film such as when George asks Mary is she wants for him to lasso the moon for her. Capra truly created an excellent film.The writing of this film was pure bliss. There are not that many films out there that have a sense of purity such as this one and that is intended for all audiences. There were many ups and downs on this ride and it left you completely satisfied.The acting by the whole cast was remarkable. James Stewart gave a great performance as George Bailey never being able to get what he really wants and being extremely stressed by all the tasks that he has to do. Donna Reed was great as the love interest, providing much support for Stewart's character to grow off of. Lionel Barrymore was great as the big business man in town trying to buy up everything and keeping Bailey down. Excellent performances for an excellent film.Overall I give this film a strong 9/10, it is truly a timeless classic from the legendary Frank Capra. I recommend this to absolutely everyone young and old, it is a truly heartwarming story that has already gone down in film history.",8,2,3,20 August 2010
Paths of Glory," Kubrick's Genius at Work
","The war drama Paths of Glory is directed by Stanley Kubrick and stars Kirk Douglas and George Macready. The film takes place in 1916 France.General Paul Mireau (Macready) is ordered by a superior general to take an area known as the Anthill in his sector which is currently under German control. At first Mireau declines because the mission is impossible but when the superior general says how he may be considered for a promotion Mireau goes through with the action. Mireau personally supervises Colonel Dax's (Douglas) attack on the German controlled territory but when Dax's troops do not even make it out of the French trenches Mireau orders that the French artillery fire on their own men to motivate them. When the battery Captain refuses to do so without a written order the general does not pursue the option but instead decides to try three men from under Dax's command for cowardice which is punishable by death.The screenplay by Stanley Kubrick, Calder Willingham, and Jim Thompson is superb. The characterization of General Mireau and Colonel Dax are both great and by the end of the film you know the two for exactly who they are. Also you get quite attached to the men that are tried for cowardice and hope for them all the way to the end. What makes this film different from most other war films is that there is no action in it after the attack on Anthill. It is part courtroom drama as well and this film is much more than it appears. Also I absolutely loved the ending which featured Stanley Kubrick's future wife, the only female in the entire film and his wife until he died in 1999.Stanley Kubrick is often called one of the greatest directors of all time and this film shows why he is. The shot that I absolutely loved was a long shot of General Mireau travelling the trenches and greeting several soldiers on his path before the attack on Anthill. Nothing makes me happier than seeing a beautiful long shot like that, and by long I mean that it lasts for a long time not that it is far away. Also when Colonel Dax is on the battlefield the shots of him are absolutely mesmerizing, the fact that this film was completely ignored by the Academy Awards is just a shame on their part. Throughout the film there are plenty of more wonderful shots, one is towards the end with a bunch of soldiers in front of a large building, I won't describe what is happening because it is a spoiler. I personally believe that Kubrick is the greatest director of all time and obviously that is arguable but I believe everyone who respects film understands that Kubrick is a genius and this film is just one of the many examples why.Kirk Douglas gives a very powerful performance in this film. He is very strong and military like and deserves much praise for his performance. When he gives his strongest performance is when he confronts General Mireau or General Broulard at the end of the film. Also, when Douglas is leading his men on the battlefield he does a very good job. The only problem with Douglas's character is that he is kind of one dimensional. He is a man who believes in justice and truth, not in politics. Truly a man that a person can look up to. But that is basically it, but that is all he needs to be because even though he is the lead the supporting characters take up a large part of the eighty seven minute film. This is the first of two films that Douglas works with Kubrick, the other being Spartacus, and the two are a great team.George Macready also gives a great performance except his character is the exact opposite of Douglas's, he is a selfish, despicable man. But Macready plays the part extremely well. Whenever him, Colonel Dax, General Broulard, or all of them together all three of them give their best performances. The look of Macready's eyes is what really makes his performance so powerful, his stare can break a person's will. Also, when Macready was at the battle of Anthill ordering the artillery to fire on his own men his devious performance was fantastic as well.Overall I give this film a 9/10, it is another Kubrick classic. Everything about it was great, and what I love about Kubrick's films is that he never uses music to tell the audience how to react to what is happening on the screen. He lets them feel how they want to feel. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys war or courtroom dramas. It definitely is a must see just for Kubrick's direction.",9,1,3,11 December 2010
RED," A Fluffy Action Comedy
","The action comedy Red is directed by Robert Schewentke and stars Bruce Willis, Mary Louise Parker, John Malkovich, Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren, Karl Urban and Brian Cox. The film takes place all over the country and is set in modern day.Frank Moses (Willis) is retired and extremely dangerous. He calls up the pension office frequently just so he talk to Sarah Ross (Parker) because he admires her. When a group of assassins tries to kill Moses he goes to Kansas City and kidnaps Ross because he fears that she may also be in danger. William Cooper (Urban) is a CIA agent who is assigned to track to Moses and take him down. Moses must find out why he is being hunted and he goes to his old friends Marvin Boggs (Malkovich), Joe Matheson (Freeman), and Victoria (Mirren) to help uncover the wide spread conspiracy. Nothing is more dangerous than the retired and extremely dangerous.The screenplay by Jon and Erich Hoeber was weak and conventional. Every twist and turn was easily foreseen and I felt no attachment to any of the characters. Let's just start with something that annoyed me at the very beginning of the film. When the assassins enter Moses' home they would not be all grouped together because they could easily be shot down, they would separate and cover the whole house. Then after that the group of assassins outside of the house just shoot at the house in the middle of a neighborhood. Ridiculous! It would be so much easier to just do a search and destroy, not just a shoot a lot and hope you kill the guy. Now onto the characters. There was no need for Frank Moses to have a love interest, it just makes the film more corny. Secondly I never got to know either Moses or Ross. The character description for Moses would be retired CIA agent and Ross would be normal woman. That is all that you know about those characters. On a positive note there were some funny lines in the screenplay, most of them were from Marvin Boggs. Still though it is not a good comedy, and as you can see from my above comments it is not a good action film.Robert Schwentke's direction was not terrible, even if it was great I could not give this film higher than a 7/10. He had some cool special effects going on, such as when Moses gets out of the police car and just starts shooting like it is nothing. But Schewentke is also to blame for the way the assassins at the beginning were choreographed so there goes the director points for cool special effects. Besides the special effects though there was nothing amazing about the shot choices. I can't imagine him giving much direction to the actors since they are all veterans. Willis, Freeman, Malkovich, and Mirren probably said to Schwentke during rehearsal how he isn't necessary to be there, we all know how to not really act in a movie that will hopefully win the opening weekend.There were a lot of stylistic choices in the editing by Thom Noble. All the transitions with the post cards were an interesting touch to the film, it definitely didn't hurt it at all. I felt at times though that Red was trying to imitate Kick Ass with all of the special effects and stylistic editing. That isn't a bad thing but if it was it did not really compete with Kick Ass in that category.The acting overall I would have to say is pretty poor, with one exception. Bruce Willis basically just read the lines and looked all suave, and he was a poor lead. He in no way brought me into the film the whole time I just kept thinking this movie is made for people to feel like they are watching a movie. The same goes for Mary Louise Parker, in how she just played a conventional normal woman put under extreme circumstances. Now the only person in this film that I can actually say is good is John Malkovich. He is great as being a paranoid, insane, ex spy who just wants to kill everyone and thinks everyone is trying to kill him. Almost all the laughs in the film comes from him, he steals the show away. Morgan Freeman is like Bruce Willis who plays a suave guy with a couple of one liners, nothing too special. Helen Mirren has a small part but she also brings in a few good one liners. Karl Urban plays the CIA agent trying to kill Frank Moses and he is decent nothing special. He in no way does a bad job, he just doesn't do a good job. I just have to say that the woman that Urban's character takes orders from in the film is probably one of the worst actresses I have ever seen. All she does is say lines with an evil voice. I'm not going to look up her name because then she wins. Lastly Brian Cox is kind of decent as a Russian spy guy, he gives a few laughs out.If you were really hoping to see a movie that is extremely thin then this is the one for you. I'm giving this a 5/10 just because Malkovich did some strong work in here. If you want to know some better action comedies than this off the top of my head there is Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Live Free or Die Hard, and True Lies. This is just a light hearted movie, so if that's what you're into then watch this.",5,1,5,6 November 2010
The Truman Show," One of Peter Weir's Finest
","The dramedy The Truman Show is directed by Peter Weir and stars Jim Carrey, Laura Linney, and Ed Harris. The film takes place in a modern day film set.The film starts off with a man named Christof (Harris) telling how he created a television series where a person's life is watched from beginning to end. This person is Truman Burbank (Carrey). Truman is a very nice person and he has no idea that his life is not normal and that he is actually on television. He is married to Meryl Burbank (Linney) who is an actress that is not really married to him. So basically Truman's whole life is scenarios set up by Christof for the entertainment of the world to watch. But soon Truman starts to realize things and believes that something is wrong...The screenplay is from Andrew Niccol and it is his second, his first being Gattaca. Niccol received an Oscar nomination for his writing and he does deserve it. The film is extremely original and is a true pleasure to watch. It is funny and full of drama, and I just couldn't wait to see how it ended. There are only a few minor problems with the screenplay and none of them made it not enjoyable. One of them was the fact that there were no strong anti slavery groups against the show because in a way Truman was a slave. Another is that there were some convenient slips of the tongue which made Truman more suspicious. Besides those though it was an excellent screenplay.The direction of this film was also quite good. Peter Weir as well earned an Oscar nomination, and yes he did earn it. He really knew how to get great performances out of his actors, every single one of them played their parts great. The shots in the film were excellent as well and I just felt so absorbed. I was rooting for Truman the whole time and it is hard to get a person to like a character that much. Overall very good direction.The acting in this film was superb. Jim Carrey gives a great performance as Truman and this is one of the few performances that Carrey has that is not a comedic role. He is great being so innocent and warm hearted. I just loved it whenever he said 'If I don't see you again later good afternoon, good evening, and good night'. Laura Linney was great as Truman's pretend wife. She acted like a not so great actress and it was really quite enjoyable to watch her try and make Truman believe that his world is real. One of my favorite parts of this film for me is when Truman is questioning her and she just starts saying how great cocoa beans are for an advertisement. She was just great. Ed Harris was the creator of the show, Christof, and he gave an excellent performance. He received an Oscar nomination for the intense creative mind and he deserved because while I was watching I could really feel how much he loved the world he created. And the last thing he wanted to happen was for Truman to destroy it.Overall I give this film a very strong 8/10. I would recommend This film for anyone who likes creative films, Jim Carrey, or just really enjoyable films.",9,0,1,6 September 2010
The Social Network," The Year's Best
","Aaron Sorkin called this film a court room drama so I will too, The Social Network is directed by David Fincher and stars Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, and Justin Timberlake. The film takes place at Harvard in 2003.The film begins with 19 year old Mark Zuckerberg (Eisenberg) on a date with a Boston University student Erica Albright. At the date Erica breaks up with Mark because of how rude he is. Mark tries to get her back but is unable to. Then Mark gets drunk and starts blogging about how much he dislikes his girlfriend while at the same time with his roommates creating a website known as facesmash where students at Harvard choose which one of their female peers are more attractive. The site crashes the Harvard network because it got 22,000 hits extremely quickly at four in the morning. The film then goes on to show how the Winklevoss twins hire Mark to create a social networking site. The film cuts back and forth to the future where Mark Zuckerberg is simultaneously being sued by his best friend Eduardo (Garfield) and the Winklevoss twins.The screenplay for this film was absolutely brilliant. Like many people when I heard that there was going to be a movie about the founders of Facebook I was not too excited, but this film really is not about the founders. It is about the relationships they have with each other and the dark deeds they did to get Facebook going. The writing is very fast paced as well, just like the world of Facebook. Sorkin fills the script with brilliant wit, and is able to keep a bunch of kids in a house interesting for a surprisingly long time. The characters are extremely well developed and I support them all yet I see their faults. The end of this film is absolutely brilliantly as well, one of the best conclusions I have seen in years. If Aaron Sorkin does not win an Oscar for his screenplay then I do not know what the world is coming to.The direction for this film by the Oscar nominated David Fincher was stunning as well. First of all, the rowing scene. That scene was some of the best cinematography I have ever seen and I remember turning to my friend and saying to him that I bet this film wins for the best cinematography at the Oscars and he said that he would not take that bet even though he would get every other film that came out this year. Now personally I would have taken that bet because the odds are fantastic. Fincher got great performances from all of the actors and I really liked seeing how he evolved from really a director of cult hits like Fight Club to something so beautiful as this that everyone can enjoy. Like Sorkin, I believe he deserves an Oscar for this film as well but I do not think it is as high of a chance as Sorkin winning one.I was surprised at how good the acting was in this film. Usually when I think Jesse Eisenberg I think about Michael Cera because they always play the same sort of awkward roles. But The Social Network is to Eisenberg is like what Boogie Nights was to Wahlberg. It shows the world that not only can Eisenberg act, he can act really well. His magnificent portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg may even earn him an Oscar nomination. The way he moved and his facial expressions, and even that blank stare on his face was just magnificent. This is the first time I have seen Andrew Garfield act and I thought he did a fine job as well as Mark's best friend and the CFO of Facebook Eduardo Saverin. Not Oscar nomination worthy but he made me care about his character that was being left behind the rest of the Facebook founders. Justin Timberlake played the part of Sean Parker and had some great comedic moments in the film. I have always respected Timberlake as an actor ever since I saw him in Alpha Dog and in this film I thought he was perfect. The rest of the cast was also great throughout the film.The score for this film I liked a lot as well. It was basically almost all sort of electronic sounds for the most part which really worked with the internet theme of the film. The only part that I remember where it did not sound electronically was the rowing scene I mentioned in the paragraph about the direction was that very famous classical piece that I do not know the name of. The score was perfect for this film.Overall I give this film a 10/10. There was absolutely no way it could be improved in my personal opinion and I believe it is a perfect film. I would not be surprised if this film wins Best Picture at the Oscars, I know I would support it to. In my review of The Town I stated that it was the best film of the year that I have seen so far. Well The Social Network blows it out of the water. Everyone must see this, stop reading and head to the theatre.",10,2,5,2 October 2010
The Pursuit of Happyness," An Inspirational Film That Will Leave You Clapping
","The drama The Pursuit of Happiness is directed by Gabriele Muccino and stars Will Smith, Jaden Smith, and Thandie Newton. The film takes place in 1980 San Francisco.Chris Gardner (Will Smith) is a middle aged man who sells bone density scanners for a living, which does not serve his life style very well. He is smarter than most, and is very good with people. That is why when he sees a man parking his sports car he asks him what his job is. The man just happens to be a stock broker so Gardner decides to apply for an internship program which gives out no pay. When Chris's financial situation gets so bad his girlfriend (Newton) goes to New York to get a better paying job leaving Chris and his son (Jaden Smith) alone and broke. Chris must get the stock broker job to give his son an appropriate lifestyle to grow up in or they will end up homeless and starving...The screenplay for this film by Steve Conrad is very traditional. It is just the usual uplifting story with all its highs and lows. Yes, the characters of Chris Gardner and Chris Jr. are very likable and the type of protagonists an audience loves to root for. But I thought it was cruel how characters such as Chris's girlfriend Linda are portrayed as a villain. She is going through the same situation as Chris and offers to take their son with her to New York but still the writing makes her appear as a villain. The main focus of the film is money and it seems like Chris Gardner will not be satisfied until he lives a luxurious life like those that he works for. On the plus side there are several very funny and enjoyable moments in the film, I will not spoil them for those of you who have not seen it. This is a very predictable film though, but is still enjoyable.Gabriele Muccino's direction was not anything really noteworthy. Again I would have to blame the way Linda is portrayed also on him but compliment him for all the great segments of comedy. In no way did any of the shots make me impressed at any point, like Conrad's screenplay the shot selection is very traditional. Muccino did get very good performances from basically the whole cast of the film, never at one point did I think to myself I can't enjoy this film because of how bad that actor is doing.Speaking of the acting I will start with Will Smith's Oscar nominated performance. I have yet to see the film Ali which he was also nominated for but this is the best that I have ever seen him do. He is extremely likable, as he is in all of his films, but he almost forces the audience to want him to succeed. This film was Jaden Smith's first performance and he made an outstanding debut. Young Smith played the role of an extremely cute kid who just wants a normal life perfectly and supplied much of the comedic relief. Thandie Newton plays the part of the evil girlfriend Linda and plays it very well since she is very unlikable during the film even though she should be very relatable. The rest of the supporting cast does a fine job and keep this uplifting drama going.The score for this film is very good and appropriate. It added another layer to the stress going on in the film or added light heartedness when it was an enjoyable part. Andrea Guerra's score was definitely one of the strongest parts of the film and is another addition to his impressive resume.Overall I give this film a 7/10, it is very traditional and predictable but features some fine performances. This is a good movie and I'm sure that anyone who watches this will enjoy it even though they will think it is corny. This was probably Will Smith's last good movie and hopefully in the future he will be the Will Smith we all know in love instead of trying to get an Oscar so much. Definitely see this if you want to watch and inspirational feel good film, don't see this if you are looking for something original and thought provoking.",7,0,0,14 November 2010
