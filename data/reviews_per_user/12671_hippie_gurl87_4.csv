Walk the Line," Better than Harry Potter
","I saw both movies opening weekend. I totally was digging Walk the Line. The next day I went to see Harry Potter and I don't read the books but I was expecting things to be explained to me like in the first three. Well I just stared at the screen for two hours. I had no idea what was going on. Two people who read the books talked my ear off about it and it's just not interesting. Plus, I had a terrible time being cramped up by tons of nerds and the nerds got mad when I cut the huge line going in. Old people and adults drop your kids off to see Harry Potter and you can go see Walk the Line. You'll have a much easier time getting in to Walk the Line and not have to stand in a line for two hours and sit for two boobless hours feeling as though you took LSD. The guy who played Johnny was awesome, he is very convincing and plays all the good songs by Johnny. I know for a fact he is going to get best actor of the year because he deserves it. All the actors were good and real. I had a great time and you will too.",10,2,4,20 November 2005
Garden State," boring
","What a waste of time. I rather watch a cat take a crap, at least it would have a great ending. Zack Braff is nothing but an indie kid, trying to create a new generation of indie zombies. Too intellectual and deep for it's own good. Overall it just sucked. It was lame how the chick said 'listen to this' and it was The Shins. It's like ' hey look I know this band and they are cool. Everybody should listen to them.' Too much dialog and not enough movie, or excitement. It was trying to be like a generation movie (mallrats) but really it was just blah. I think everyone should try their best to avoid this movie, and if you see it, it should be for the sole purpose of criticism.",1,12,28,8 August 2005
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Pretentious, Dry, and Unbearable
","I went in not knowing anything about this movie and I walked out in an half hour knowing everything about it. It was one of worst movies I've ever seen. I'm a generally a nice person but if somebody told me they liked this movie, I would probably never talk to them again. Anybody who likes it throughly is most likely to have an extremely dry, hermit type personality. I'm gonna also include that they think they are pretty intelligent too, just like the self-centered fart bags who do the voices for the movie. I know everyone has different types of humor, some people may not even like mine, but that's okay; I don't think this covers any range of humor though. This movie is as flat and dull as Wes Anderson's mind. Go in and get ready to walk out; it's best to get your money back too.",1,18,53,28 November 2009
V for Vendetta," Best Movie Ever!
","This movie is so cool. I would choose to watch this movie over all of my favorite movies that I own. I really enjoyed this movie because it has everything. It has action, romance, good story plot and sorrow. I was literally sitting on the edge of my seat staring at the screen. There are a few people bashing the movie mainly because they think it's against the bush administration but if it is, who cares it's still a good movie and will always be. It's just a movie that is worth seeing. I hated The Matrix but this movie is different from those movies and it makes sense. The movie is like a good poop session or a good meal or just an awesome movie in general. Go see it! Worth every penny. :)",10,0,5,18 March 2006
