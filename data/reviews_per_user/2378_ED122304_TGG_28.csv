Skyfall," Pretty Great
","Out of the Daniel Craig James Bond films this is my personal favorite, you get the classic James Bond vibes and everything plus it's a breath of fresh air from its predecessor quantum of solace.",9,0,3,7 July 2020
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The adventure movie
","This movie is an actual classic, Actually the whole series is a classic
I recomend you see it",10,2,4,6 June 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Amazing
","One of the best star wars movies out there, a lot of action, humor and an awesome storyline",9,3,5,6 June 2018
Captain Marvel," Great, but not for everybody
","I think this was a pretty good backstory for both captain marvel and nick fury. It had great visuals, a great storylines, a few plot twists, and even some emotional scenes.
However, it does make the timeline much more complicated and will definitely leave you confused at the end of the movie
Its also not for everyone, as it did get a pretty poor viewer rating, Why?, they weren't wrong she definitely had little to no weaknesses and there was a slight agenda to it. But if you don't think about it, you wont really see it. But other than that, i thought it was great, had 90's music as well.the cat's pretty cool",8,3,10,17 March 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Makes up for all the other thor movies
","I did not like the first and second Thor movies, but this one was awesome. The Techno music was cool, and the storyline was awesome! I recommend it",9,1,3,27 April 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," best spider man movie
","Good story, good character development, awesome fight scenes and a lot of suspense!",10,27,48,27 April 2018
Doctor Strange," Amazing story and CGI
",It is a great movie i would recommend it to anyone,10,0,1,26 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Underrated
","I think this movie is pretty good as a Starwars movie. Some people complain about the dialogue, but if you understand the characters perspective it's fine. Plus he wrote the romance lines as some sort of Starwars Shakespearean mix. Once you take all that in account, it's good. Especially the battle of geonosis.",8,0,0,18 January 2020
Captain America: The First Avenger," Good
",This movie was a perfect mixture of WWII and a superhero movie. I would say this was a pretty good movie,10,0,0,3 March 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Not just another boring origin story
",If you like the Spider-Man Comics or just Spider-Man in general this movie is for you. It mixes the new spider man (miles morales) and the spider verse together in a very awesome way. And brings some iconic alter Spider-Men from the comics (Spider-Gwen and Spider-Man Noir) it has an amazing story line (emotional at some points) and it never disappoints.,10,5,9,9 February 2019
The Patriot," Good but a little inaccurate
","Its a Great war movie and a nice patriotic/revenge story, but there are a few over-exaggerated historical details. (Such as British atrocities, the man the movie is based off of, etc). But if you're not there for the history and just want a patriotic movie to watch for July 4th, why not?",8,0,0,7 July 2020
The Amazing Spider-Man," OK
","Not as good as Spiderman Homecoming from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I felt like the plot went by REALLY fast, but other than that it was a cool movie",6,0,1,26 April 2018
Captain America: Civil War," A lot of suspense
","I would say this movie had a lot of suspense, and a very dark tone. It was a pretty good movie altogether, but I would say it was more of an avengers movie than a captain America movie.",8,0,0,3 March 2019
Quantum of Solace," Rushed
","Sure there is a few cool action scenes, but the plot to me feels as if it has no pacing. The scenes go by so fast you have no idea what's going on and what the movie is about. It just lacks overall depth to me.",6,0,0,7 July 2020
Toy Story 4," A Good Ending for The Movies
","This movie was a very good finale for the beloved four movie franchise, Toy Story. It mixes story, humor, and emotion in a very good way. (There are even some parts that have jump-scares. ) It is sad to see the franchise end, but overall this movie raps it up pretty well",9,0,2,24 June 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Amazing movie!
","It has good action, A lot of emotion, a lot of suspense, a lot of surprises, this movie was just awesome. 
Its also awesome to see the guardians of the galaxy meet the avengers!
Also Thanos is an amazing villian!",10,6,9,29 April 2018
The Lion King," Fun but doesn't compare to original
","The Lion king is considered to be one of the greatest family films out there. The animated one is a movie that will probably go down in history. So when the live action was announced, everyone was pretty excited and had high expectations- i know I did.When I saw it, I enjoyed it, it had all the classic songs and the memorable moments, the humor and the movie generally mixed well, and the graphics were amazing. However if you compare this new live action with the original, it just isn't as good. Emotional or action scenes felt rushed and underwhelming. I'm sure many of you will understand once you see it.But overall, great film",9,0,2,8 August 2019
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Like the last one
","It was not that good, and the plot is WAY to speedy
The good thing is that there was a little bit more humor in it than the last one, but other than that...",6,0,0,6 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Too political and a lot of rushed characters
","Well, this movie was a little too controversial. Many of the characters were poorly developed or underused. Phasma for example, who only appeared for 4 minutes total. Seriously, it took me a couple minutes to figure out that i was watching a star wars movie, not a comedy advertisement.
In other words, was way too politically controversial, had no starwars logic, many characters were underused, and didnt feel like a sw movie.",4,11,15,4 November 2018
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Dark
","Very dark,but a very enjoyable movie as well. This movie brings in a few new characters, and certainly has all the action someone would want in a superhero movie",8,3,4,3 March 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Funny
","I laughed a lot while watching this movie, And it was as good as the first Guardians of the galaxy",10,0,1,27 April 2018
Thor," Okay
","Not as good as the other Marvel movies, was kinda slow at some parts, but I would say it was decent",7,0,1,3 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Awesome
","People say that all of the prequels are bad but this movie proves those people wrong. it succeeded on telling people how Anakin turned into darth vader and it personally is my favorite star wars movie. Sure, its PG-13 but isn't all of the new ones?Also just saying, this movie contains the best lightsaber duel, and extremely good soundtracks",10,7,8,4 November 2018
Black Panther," Great storyline, and effects
","I loved this movie, because of the amazing story,the character, the villain and because it was awesome. The villain - Killmonger was well planned and was cool. This movie broke many records, so that just proves of how well it was made.",10,16,37,27 April 2018
Thor: The Dark World," Terrible
","This movies plot went way to fast, and at the end of the movie, you still barely know what happened, due to the lack of character development. I would say this was a pretty bad movie, but you need to watch it in order to fully understand Infinity War.",6,0,1,3 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Awesome, But too similar to a new hope
","It was a really good movie, and it had a lot of humor and action,My only complaint is that it was too similar to A New Hope
Also there is a massive plot hole with ReyIf you haven't seen it you will have to watch the movie to know what i mean",8,0,26,6 June 2018
Spectre," Meh
","It starts off strong with an intriguing plot that gets more and more interesting as it goes and then has one of the most underwhelming endings I have ever watched in my entire life. But overall, it has everything you would expect from a bond film (action, humor, etc) even if it's second half isn't that great.",7,0,0,7 July 2020
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," A classic
","This was an amazing movie, my personal favorite in the Indy series. Has good plot, a lot of humor, and some emotion too. not to mention plot twists",10,19,25,4 November 2018
