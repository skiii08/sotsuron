Mission: Impossible III," alias gets not lost in M.I. 3
","Saw the movie today on the big screen... this is, by far, the best M.I. up till now.Putting J.J. Abrams in charge was the best choice made concerning this movie. If you know Alias and Lost, you can imagine what he can do with a big budget like the one this film has.It's 2 hours of adrenaline that splashes of the screen. The actor's are good, the story is good, the directing is good. Philip Seymour Hoffmanis the best bad guy I've seen in times.Hopefully there will be a M.I. 4 with once again J.J. Abrams in charge. The only thing that is strange is Tom Cruise, any random actor could play this role, but Tom is okay! Maybe the M.I. series will run for years and eventually Tom will be replaced. (just like the 007 series).So now go get your ticket!",8,35,72,3 May 2006
