10 Cloverfield Lane," Tense and claustrophobic, this will put you on the edge of your seat
","That's what it is, do not go see this movie if you except an action packed flick with extreme fast pace, because it is not. 10 Cloverfield lane is a slow and pretty clever suspense, only let down by the last five minutes at the end.Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a young woman, is driving away after what seemed to have been an argument with her boyfriend. Distracted by her man calling, she gets hit by a pickup truck and flies off in the field. (Looked like an anti-texting while driving commercial). She then wakes up attached in a bunker. She will meet its builder, Howard (John Goodman), an old conspiracy theorist veteran and Emmet (John Gallagher Jr.), a young man with a broken arm. One of the many things which are great about this movie is the way it always leaves you guessing. Indeed, early on, Howard explains to us that the world has been subject to an attack and that its surface is irradiated and toxic. It doesn't take long for Emmet and Michelle to make us doubt about it, but an event is going to change our mind and make us believe Howard. But even though you've seen the effect of the 'toxic' air, you still have doubt on the mental sanity of the old man during the old movie, as the two other protagonists uncovers horrible things about him. The part which left me in shock the most was when Howard killed Emmet with cold-blood. It's at this moment we realize that this man is not sane and begin to again doubt what we've seen outside. I also liked the establishment of Michelle's talents in couture, it pays-off really well as she builds the gas mask and suit. I sadly cannot judge the acting fully, given that I've seen the movie dubbed in French, but besides that, John Goodman gave an amazing performance, he was a very believable 'psycho'. Winstead and Gallagher did a very good job as well. The cinematography is also great. The camera makes a really good job at make us feel like we are in a tiny bunker by using a lot of close shots and good uncut shots revealing characters or object increasing the tension. But, onto the disappointing part, the movie could have, and should have stopped as soon as Michelle got out. I felt like the alien attack and the fight scene was too much, the film already had a great tense and suspenseful escape scene, it was not necessary to add this mindless action at the end. This film lost a point with his ending, but it was no enough to ruin anything, being only 5 to 10 minutes long. Do not go in excepting action or Cloverfield 2, for that matter. I do though totally recommend it if you want a movie with great characters, acting, cinematography, story and suspense.",9,4,7,15 March 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Where's the versus?
","I agree it may seem a bit harsh, but there are things you come to expect when you go see a movie called: Batman vs Superman. It's in no way a horrible movie, nor a bad oneit's okaycorrect. Part of the reason might be because of the lack of focus on that 'versus' part. Let me explain.First, the plot: We all remember metropolis form man of steel right? Well Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) didn't forget that pile of ashes either, because he was there, and he saw Superman (Henry Cavill) create chaos. So batman ain't super happy about that, and doesn't like the fact that this 'god' thinks he is above the laws and everything. So they'll fightbut you all saw the trailers right? OK, I don't need to explain the plot, because it is exactly what we've seen in the first trailer. (I feel so mean against that movie, sorry) I'll continue with what I liked, because I liked quite a few things. Surprisingly, I liked Ben Affleck as Batman, he acted very well and we could easily understand the motivations in his character. I like Alfred (Jeremy Irons) a lot, a bit younger and fresher version. (I like me some change sometimes) The new bat cave, bat mobile were great. The suits were okay, I believe Batman looked a bit too big in them, especially the metal one. The action was also great (For the most part). Regarding the fight between the God and the bat, it was extremely well choreographed and well shot. Thankfully no overly shaky cams. Everything that touches cinematography is good; I at least expected that, it delivered.The first half, the set-up and everything is good for the most part. We see both batman and superman's motivations, we have glimpses at everything that is Batman, and we see the fear growing in some people of metropolis. But it is not all butterfly and goody-goody, because here's the biggest problem with this flick: The narrative! Let's get the subplot of Lois Lane getting captured by ISIS (I know it's not them) and then doing stuff with the government, because it was pretty much useless. Where do I start...? It didn't have to be that much about Lex Luthor for god sake! (I didn't really like him either; he annoyed me a bit sometimes) The movie is titled as a confrontation between two heroes, I totally understand and get the setup with Lex, he is essential to the plot I think. Lex Luthor is a nice catalyst, at the beginning, he seemed to be there to bring the two heroes to fight against each other. Sadly, we later realize he's pretty much the main villain, and that epic confrontation between Batman and Superman is less than 10 minutes long. Oh, how disappointed was I when I watched the two gladiators stop fighting after such a short amount of time.We saw Batman grow hatred for Superman during the whole first part, didn't we deserve an epic finally at the end of the film, cumulating from all the lesser confrontations between the twos. No, we got Doomsday, CGI monster there to force them to join up. And that fight, too much heavy on CGI, it looked fake, I hated that.Oh and Wonder woman was there, did I mention her? So was the flash, cyborg andAqua man. No, I'm exaggerating; Wonder Woman had a much bigger role than the three others. She looks great, but we all know she was shoe-horned in with everyone to set-up justice leagueto catch- up, maybe, on Marvel. Sadly, this Film forgets to be his own movie and opts on setting up other movies. They wanted to put too much in this flick, and it failed. They could have revealed Doomsday at the very end, we then would have wanted a follow-up focusing on him and maybe other heroes trying to take it down.It was okay, it suffered from a lot. This lack of spotlight on the 'versus' , this Lex Luthor heavy focusand the will of catching-up on the 8 years old Marvel cinematic universe. But is has redeeming qualities. THAT AQUAMAN CAMEO! (Just kidding) Ben Affleck, Jeremy IronsThe Batman universe in general was great. Superman was good. We had some action worthy of Zack Snyder. I could talk about why this movie worked in places and didn't in others for hours, but I can't here. Go see it if you're a fan. Don't bother and wait for DVD release if you don't care much.",6,18,36,24 March 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A reboot? Maybe not that much
","Star Wars is a saga that I deeply cherish, it had been following me since I was 5 years old and I still am a big fan of it. You can't imagine the excitement when I heard they were going to make a new film soon, something I literally had dreams about. I will say, I think the 3 prequels could have been much better. But onto the new installment: The force awakens.Poe Dameron (Oscar Issac), the best pilot in the resistance, was charged to find a map to locate Luke Skywalker. As the first order attacks, Poe charges the little ball droid BB-8 with the burden. Poe gets captured and BB-8 is sent roaming alone in the desert planet of Jakku.Let's begin with the main fault people find to this movie: 'It looks too much like A New Hope'. Yes, it has similar plot points, and I almost didn't care. Because what people seem to forget is what new stuff it brings to the table. In a new hope, I don't remember a Stormtrooper, Finn (John Boyega), deserting the imperial ranks. Vader was cool, but he never was as deep as kylo ren (Adam Driver) in the movie. I don't recall the owner of the mos eisley cantina being a 900 years old almost mystical creature. The point is, the new characters, especially Rey (Daisy Ridley) will make you forget about that critic, it has similar plot point, but I found myself not caring that much. This movie is simple enough, but still complex. It has a basic story; a no-name woman gets the help of a few people to defeat an evil force. And like in the previous star wars movies, it works. I found it fun to have a movie that I could just enjoy and shrink down to being a kid. Unlike the prequels, the characters seem real; they are 3 dimensional and relatable and likable. Except for one which is a little bit too much powerful, but I suppose the next films will explain some of that. Kylo Ren was a personal favorite, I have a weakness for psychotic and tormented characters, and I just can't explain it. Kylo's frequent outbursts, his inferiority complex and his fears, made him a very interesting character. Dialogues felt real and true to the characters, from Finn's clumsiness and Rey's innocence, to Poe's cockiness. The special effects are top, there's a very good mix of practical (thank god) and CGI and everything looked real. I really loved the actions scenes, never cutting to explosions Michael bay style; JJ Abram knew how to direct our attention towards the actors while the action was unfolding around them. The cinematography was lovely. I don't know if you ever noticed in the prequels, but the shots were really boring and repetitive. But none of that here, it's much more creative. The lighting is hard to talk about, but in one scene, it mirrors the light work in the duel of episode VI and I loved it, it added a lot to the emotional factor.The soundtrack wasn't my personal favorite of the six, but was still great, just not as memorable. It had a few problems, starkiller base (which I don't want to talk about for spoiler reasons) and one scene in particular which had too much CGI for my taste. The similarity to episode IV might annoy some people but I didn't find them distracting at all. Go see it if you want a fun time, if you want to see fun action, likable characters and a generally good adventure movie. If someone tells you it sucked, listen to what they had to say, ask a review from themthey'll probably tell you about the similarities with ANH and a certain Mary Sue. But it was a wonderful experience, a dream come true for a fan like meI saw it 5 times. What's wrong with me?",7,0,6,24 March 2016
