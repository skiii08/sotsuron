Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Now it all becomes clear
","Any of the Star Wars series fans, must have heard about the rumors of what had happened before the Episode IV. There were all kinds of rumors around, three years ago. Now at last the 'hanging in midair' story has its firm bases. The Episode I didn't have all that much shooting and starfighter combats. It's special effects were amazing (like the ones in the Special Edition) and there were a lot of lightsabre combats (which I prefer to starfighter combats). Many people told me that they didn't like the movie that much because there wasn't much action. I personally disagree, but even if there wasn't enough action, the filling of the background story that was lacking in the first trilogy, was enough compensation. Now we have to wait and see the Clone Wars (noted in Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope) in the Episode II.",10,0,0,5 October 1999
