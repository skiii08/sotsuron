Walk the Line," A solid biopic elevated by heavyweight performances and slick direction
","Walk The Line doesn't quite reveal the full Johnny Cash story, and may have all the predictability of standard biopics that we've all seen before, but is executed with such skillful relish and expert performances that I really didn't care if I saw it coming. Like any good album it has you moving to the beat and miming the words. The film documents Cash's early life. As a child Cash witnessed the death of his older brother, which his dad always held against him. After leaving home, he then sets out to be discovered, despite having a band of mechanics who can't play for squat. Eventually he is discovered, and then goes on tour with the likes of Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presly - and this is where he finds June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), whose relationship with Cash provides us with the heart of the film.Johnny Cash loved Joaquin Phoenix ever since he saw him in Ridley Scott's Gladiator. So did I. Like his late brother River, he has this raw intensity that just grabs you in. He was certainly the finest thing in Oliver Stone's putrid yet compelling U-Turn, and stood toe-to-toe with Mel Gibson in Signs. This is definitely his finest hour. He walks, talks, moves and even sings like the 'man in black'. He is a tower of screen presence. And the most remarkable thing is Reese Witherspoon as June Carter Cash is even better. She is a fizzy mix of southern charm and sass, making June as likable as she is fierce. Phoenix is dead on but never astonishing. I still think Heath Ledger is the most deserving of the big Oscar gong, but Reese Witherspoon deserves all the awards she gets. When the film threatens not to work, their performances ensure that any liberties Mangold takes he gets away with easily.No it isn't a deep insight into Cash's tormented soul. It is well documented that his problems existed with him deep into later life. But this is a fantasy vision of his love for June. It's not, and never aspires to be, a documentary of his life. Joaquin Phoenix is great, Reese Witherspoon is amazing and James Mangold has regained the form he showed with the likes of Copland. Sure it's flawed, but I loved the characters enough that I forgot how easy it is to assume that it'll pan out the way it does.",7,0,0,13 February 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," You will go to work the next day with blood-shot eyes and cracked-ribs, but will never be able to stop giggling.
","It almost seems like a million years ago that Sacha Baron Cohen's first ever insemination of the mock-interviewer, Ali G, was born out of the sporadically humorous '11 O'Clock Show'. His 'yoof' approach to asking a former CIA operative question like 'Does you ave to be intelligent to be in da CIA? Ain't dat a bit racialist dough? What if you're thick an you wanna get in?' was arguably his funniest period with the character, as his spin off shows, and subsequent movie, over-fed us the increasingly waning joke. The movie in particular, Ali G In Da House, had its moments, albeit very fleetingly, but was overall a complete washout compared to the riotous nature of that characters interviews with real people. Inside a fictional world, Ali was as crazy as the rest of it, and didn't seem like such a moron any more. Cohen's American takeover, at first, simply seemed like a cynical way of milking the cash cow even further, as most Brits had worked out by now that they were NOT being interviewed by real people, but by the creations inside Cohen's head. Granted some people still found his persona's intriguing, and the introduction of both Borat, the Kazakh reporter and Bruno the Austrian homosexual, managed to keep the fire going a little bit longer. But it still wasn't the laugh riot Cohen had us in at the beginning. So why then, is Borat the movie such a head-spinning, vain-popping, rib-cracking laugh-riot? Well there are two main reasons: America is quite a weird place after all, and instead of creating the weak fictional world that he did for Ali G In Da House, Cohen and friends have stuck with the documentary style of film making to capture the genuine and riotous reactions of all our fictional interviewer's hapless conquests.It would be easy for me to say that this film uncovers home truths about certain American ways of thinking, but it would hardly be fair, since Cohen & Friends would never keep the duller interviews. The story of the piece goes: Borat, a television reporter from Kazakhstan, decides to up and leave his hometown for a huge report about the United States of America. His goal is to hopefully discover and incorporate all that makes America great, interviewing the locals, politicians and workers in this glorious nation. Among his problems include his blatant anti-Semitism, which gets him in more than a spot of bother on at least one occasion, and his unapologetic misogynistic views, that come to the fore in a hilarious interview with a group of feminists. As he delves into the Deep South, he is accused of 'looking so conspicuous' by a cowboy rodeo-attendee, whom also advises him to 'shave that darned moustache off' since it makes him look 'like one of them Muslim fellas'.When one actually considers whether this film has achieved greatness or not, it is appropriate to examine the source, and value, of its comedy. There is at least one sequence, which I shall not give away, that was so pain-inducingly funny, that it literally had me gasping for air. The rest of the film could have been completely worthless and I would still have paid a worthy a cause, because of this one particular sequence. Much of the comedy is not so much witty, as it is gross or just bravery on Cohen's part. Who else would do things like try to enrage an entire stadium of cowboy hicks by singing a putrid version of Borat's own national anthem? But I have to be fair and say that Cohen is not a great comedian, yet sometimes, great comedy doesn't necessarily take all the great laughs. Watching Borat is, at times, a poignant experience about how certain members of the world's only superpower genuinely think. It is only a fleeting thought, mind you, as the creation of Borat is, unto itself, none-too-less racist a man then one who doesn't like the look of those 'darned Muslim fellas' Mostly though, it is toilet humour done in an extremely funny way. It is hard to fault a film, which has been praised by the right wing as an indictment and eschewal of political correctness, and by the left wing for being an indictment of the prejudices and unsavoury opinions of 'Middle America'. For the rest of us, lets praise this for what it is: Unadulterated, non-PC sidesplitting hilarity.",8,4,12,3 November 2006
Mission: Impossible III," Impossibly entertaining
","The third instalment of the MI series attempts to add a little 'depth' to the proceedings by giving our hero a fianc√© (played by Michelle Monaghan) to further intricate the matters of Ethan Hunt. In the meantime we have Philip Seymour Hoffman in full-on Mr Nasty as Owen Davian as the man who must be stopped this time. He is after a container known as the 'white rabbit' the contents of which is never revealed. Could it be a deadly virus? A bomb? A code? A dead animal? Who knows (or cares).As Ethan and Davian play the deadly cat-and-mouse game the film never stops making things go boom! We see our protagonist impersonate a priest, wear a latex mask with a voice depreciater, manage to swing from building to building, slide down the side of one only to grab on to the edge (yes! he made it!). Apparently if you are a known arms-dealing terrorist you can have access to all sorts of helicopters and and soldiers and blow up bridges without anyone noticing.From start to finish MI:3 is complete and utter nonsense. Anyone who has recently been watching directer Abrams' TV phenomenon Lost will know just how much sense of disbelief he demands from his audience. But since the film really pushes for its key demographic (spotty, boyish teenagers) you can't really blame it. Picking on the film's lunacy is unfair, as a standard genre film it is darn entertaining. If anything the potent boisterousness of Cruise's latest action vehicle makes for a rather amusing experience on top of the first class action scenes. If you are beyond the horny teenage years you may roll your eyes when Hunt's foot-partner Luther Strickell starts talking to him about his wife in the middle of an explosion spree, yet you can't help but crack a smile at the actually-slightly-campiness of it all. What's more the film is certainly darker than the previous two. Hoffman's bad guy really spits the vile at our hero like nobody's business, to create a great foil for our lead. And stuff about explosive charges in the head may leave some slightly ill-at-ease. Yet don't despair: the ridicule never stops in this one - when the film reveals the outcome of the opening scene you'll know what I'm talking about.But what's wrong with an empty-headed couple of hours? MI:3 is nothing more than a case of 'If you missed the last explosion, don't worry, there will be another one along shortly'. And who can argue with that? It delivered exactly what you could hope for. And it kicks the hell out of MI:2.",6,1,2,16 May 2006
Requiem for a Dream," Purposefully hideous tale about a far too real journey
","You will come out of Requiem For A Dream feeling like you've just seen your children die. It's a heart crushing experience that runs on flashy paranoia and vomit inducing grit. If you don't feel sick you will definitely be upset. It's such a powerful film that features inspired performances and spot on direction. This is a film that utilises every ounce of material it is given to put it's audience through a torturous yet utterly compelling voyage of why drug addiction is anything but glorious. It's not the easiest film to watch, but it is certainly an important one.Harry and Ty are partners in petty crime. They both dwell into cocaine and heroin which leads to increasingly gruesome consequences, sending them on a long road trip to Florida. Harry goes out with Marion, another recreational drug user who along with Harry, is having money issues, and sets out to degrade herself in order to avoid freezing to death in the New York winter. Harry's mother Sara is a lonely, weight-obsessed TV addict, who is naively given speed pills in order to shed her pounds and get on a TV game show. All of them are spiralling out of control.Two things that amazed me about Aronofsky's film: Marlon Wayans, that really unfunny bloke from such laugh riots as White Chicks and Don't Be A Menace... is excellent here. Secondly, a film this bleak and raw is actually one of the most visually stylish films I've ever seen. This is all done with purpose in mind. Whereas other directors have used hazy cinematography and quick-fire editing for solely experimental purposes (I'm thinking mostly of Oliver Stone) Aronofsky creates a style that is every bit as flashy as it is meretricious. One minute Marion and Harry are lying together in a stoned haze of ecstasy, professing their love for each other in poetic, yet disturbing words. When the characters are on the move, everything illuminated, and sized up to show New York at it's most gruesome and low-key. This style makes for an incredibly watchable experience, without ever adding a lighter touch to the drama. Similarly themed pictures have had comedy touches such as Danny Boyle's Trainspotting or Scorsese's Goodfellas. Requiem owes a lot more to the horror genre, as in many ways it is an endurance test, one that kicks it's audience in the head with it's visuals and pierces through to the heart with it's narrative. The soundtrack is by Kronos Quartet, who also provided the music for Michael Mann's Heat. It provides a simmering sound wave that always suggests danger, and then goes full tilt along with the narrative's varying crescendos.It is a career high point for all concerned. Jared Leto continues to eschew his heartthrob aura by dirtying himself up as much as possible, and choosing an intelligent project, when he so easily could be Michael Bay's poster boy. Marlon Wayans really surprised me here. I'm tempted to forgive him for all his previous misdeeds, as I see a really good performer trapped behind the shtick. But the standouts are the females: Jennifer Connolly is great as the self-degrading girlfriend of Harry and Ellen Burstyn delivers a gruelling performance of an isolated woman slowly walking the line of sanity and insanity, and delivering some of the films most heart-shattering moments.There isn't much room for hope in 'Requiem'. The screenwriter, Hubert Selby Jr., has never been one to shy away from the less-than-cheerful, and we are presented with a story full of darkness and repulsion. There is too much power in this tale to make it depressing. It is more than tragic, but serves a very pertinent purpose. It has to be seen.",9,3,6,26 March 2006
Marie Antoinette," Every bit as shallow and superficial as its protagonist, Marie Antoinette is like a great big chocolate cake: Lacking nutrition, but oooh so gorgeous!
","Don't just 'Let them eat cake', let them bathe in it, with diamond bracelets all aglow, amidst a flowery bed of sumptuous 18th Century dresses and gorgeous green countryside. Perhaps this would be the message in Sofia Coppola's latest, and most ambitious, project to date, had it even the glimmer of true substance, amid the confectionery of chocolate and delightful outfits. Kirsten Dunst is Marie Antoinette, the Austrian aristocrat who is sent to France to wed the King's son Louis XVI (Schwartzman). Only fourteen, she is thrust into an all too unfamiliar technique of behaving like a royal, and living in the expectations of a nation.Whilst Coppola has not made a film devoid of emotional depth, the only true reason to enjoy this period epic is to engulf oneself into the self-indulgence of our heroine. She eats, sleeps, parties and buys her way to death, and although we are meant to believe the modern perspective of Marie Antoinette being misunderstood, and exaggerated in terms of self-consumption, the film is too superficial to effect you emotionally. Only briefly do we see Marie express herself beyond stuffing her face with poultry and champagne. But when a film looks as great as this does, are we to care that it lacks depth? Only the GCSE History students need to worry.Whilst the cast possesses competent performances from its leads, the standout acting belongs to Asia Argento, as a former French Harlot, now the royal plaything of Louis XV (Torn), and Rose Byrne, as the wine guzzling Duchesse de Polignac, socialite and friend of Marie. But even they can't compete with the film's real star ¬ñ the delicious milieu. Marie Antoinette is a sumptuous delight to look at. Forget the story or the characters ¬ñ the array of pale-faced aristocrats, in delightful corsets, indulging themselves with cakes, confectionery, meat and wine is done with such irresistible style that it almost makes up for the protracted running time. Marie Antoinette is not exactly food for thought, but dresses itself gorgeously enough to leave you satisfied. And it has a rock soundtrack to boot.",7,1,3,25 October 2006
United 93," Intense and brilliant
","There weren't many notes you could take, whether it be in the equilibrious opening or the terrifying denouement, that can describe the feelings you endure along United 93. Ample publicity has been sold on Paul Greengrass' new movie, debating the veracity of its story and whether there was a need for it to be made in the first place. How soon is too soon? How long did America wait to tell of Vietnam's nightmares? You would have been forgiven for thinking it blasphemous to even entertain the idea of shooting a movie on 9/11, yet despite the controversy United 93 is here, and will attract an audience regardless (or maybe even as a result of) its negative press.Shot in real time, on digital camera, United 93 begins with showing us the terrorists making their final morning prayers, before setting off to the airport. There are no handsome grins, nor are there nasty frowns. These men, if anything, look more terrified than you ever could. Their intentions are hidden behind an obvious human front that continually puts them at odds with themselves. We then shift to the airport's other passengers, none of which are ever given an emotional edge to them. As the film goes on we visit the men and women behind the running of the airwaves ¬ñ particularly those responsible for what should happen in case of emergencies. Many of the actors betraying these people are the people themselves, who were there on that tragic day. Using non-actors gives Greengrass' film an authentic breeze of dialogue and behaviour, that never seems forced or embellished. Whilst we never truly get a feel for any individual character we believe every word they say, and truly understand the circumstances they were put in as the tragedies unfolded. We learn how difficult it was to get in touch with the White House, when the people needed their government the most. We also learn of the confusion experienced as these planes went strangely off course before any conclusive knowledge of a hijacking had been established. But the film's biggest power lies in the chilling reenactment of the fate of flight 93. All forms of dramatic irony are completely dropped. We can feel an unease just by the soft, subtle touch of the film's score. During the opening the characters act like any man would in these types of totally conventional circumstances. Greengrass does not incorporate a view of hindsight for his audience, instead allowing the film to flow in the moment, with each passing event happening as the characters read it, rather than what the audience already knows occurred. It isn't a movie that allows much headway for dramatic convention, nor does it satisfy are needs for entertainment (which, perhaps, is what Titanic was aiming to do). All it ever tries to do, and what it achieves in great effect, is a tribute to the courage and bravery of of the passengers and staff aboard United 93.Paul Grenngrass' masterpiece is the anti-Titanic: there are no star-crossed lovers, no dastardly bad guys, no romantic journeys and absolutely zero poetic license. This is as frighteningly real as a movie gets. The characters of United 93 are so authentic it verges on the mundane at times. As the film is shot in real time, it certainly tests the patience of this eras' ever demanding audience (my idiot of a brother had the audacity to walk out after 30 minutes), but I urge all of you to stick with it. The characters aren't meant to have depth, nor are they meant to go through life-affirming changes. The film is a fine illustration, similar to the faux-documentaries that Greengrass directed in his native Britain, that documents the haunting ordeal induced by the passengers, and their subsequent bravery in attempting to foil the terrorists. The final sequence is one of the most terrifying set-pieces ever put on film, managing to raise every strand on my body to an electric edge, as the passengers desperately try to kick down the cabin door when, in one blisteringly quick moment of hope, you actually believed they can prevent it. That they can save themselves. And for this reason alone, it is a masterful piece of work, deserving of the highest praise a film can receive. Regardless of what your stance was before the film was released, United 93 is a film you have to see. You owe it to the people it illustrates, in fittingly faux-reality style, and whose bravery it commends. As a film reviewer all I could ever ask of a film is to work as a piece of art. That is all anyone should ever ask. It is, at times, worrying, distressing, haunting and terrifying. But never wrong.",9,14,24,11 July 2006
The Big Lebowski," F--- it. Let's go bowling.
","The Coen Brothers indulge us into the lives of the seemingly humdrum, yet intricately fascinating, lives of 70s enthusiast Jeff 'The Dude' Lebowski and his Vietnam-scarred, sociopathic friend Walter Sobchak. There is no point. There is a very complicated, and in the end quite anti-climactic story. What there is ,however, is more inventive charm than a circus show put on by David Lynch. Not to mention loads, and loads, and LOADS of laughs. I LOVED it. And so will you.Jeff Bridges plays The Dude, or his Dudeness, or El Duderino 'If you're not into the whole brevity thing.' We are treated at first to the site of our protagonist being given a rather unpleasant 'gift' by two goons sent to recover some sort of payment. As it turns out, they have the wrong man. Soon the dude finds himself entangled in a web of lies, as he attempts to find out who the money came from, and why they owe it. There are many plot twists along the way, which I won't ruin, although it's futile to think this film is about plot.This is perhaps the Coen Brothers' most creative work to date. Even their wildly abnormal works like Raising Arizona have been matched for delightful weirdness, in the form of The Dude's various trip-out dream sequences. This being a Coen's film there is no such thing as a small part. Check out John Turturro's wild cameo as malodorous Paedophile-cum bowling deity Jesus Quintana. Or Sam Elliot as the film's bookending cowboy narrator. He sums the film up brilliantly two minutes in when, as our narrator, he says 'Maybe I just lost my trail of thought. Maybe...After viewing 'The Big Lebowski' I was convinced that Jeff Bridges' sole existence on earth was to play The Dude. He is just perfect as the man who seems to get through all the destruction in his life with an apathetic retort of dowdy-hippydom. In a demented way it's what makes him so tranquilly admirable. John Goodman matches The Dude's bathos with psychotic blunder, and Steve Buscemi's Donnie is a rare Buscemi treat of cluelessness.Despite it's convolutions The Big Lebowski never feels unrewarding in its Rubik's-cube plotting. Whereas earlier works like the ambitious Miller's Crossing (1992) were flawed on basic storytelling levels, here we are treated to the demented worlds first, and story second. The denouement is somewhat of an anti-climax but by that point you are so far into the world of deadbeat optimism that you won't be disappointed. In fact, the indifference to it's own crescendo makes for a very fitting finale. In the end, it's not the destination the counts, it's the ride. And what a ride. I don't think Joel and Ethan have written a script with better lines, nor do I think they've ever had a better cast. This is a film without meaning, but loads of heart. And white Russians too.",8,1,3,1 March 2006
Superbad," Crude but hilarious
","Another year, another gross-out teen comedy about horny high-school losers attempting to vanquish their virginity. Two co-eds who are attempting to woo a group of girls by supplying their party with booze end up having the most elaborately awry night of their life. Going into the screening one could be forgiven for fearing the worst with the sheer number of schlock that had been farmed out of Hollywood since American Pie made the teen comedy cool again. Fear not, Superbad is a riot, and so for two key reasons. One - it is produced by Judd Apatow, comedy auteur of such hits as Knocked Up and The 40 Year Old Virgin. Two - its two stars, Jonah Hill and Michael Cena are fantastic finds. Hill takes an obnoxious, porn-obsessed oaf of a kid and laces him with bags of charm and great comic timing. Cera goes one step further, engulfing his character with the kind of nervous stuttering that only a Ricky Gervais sitcom might dare make funny. It may be crude, crass and deeply superficial. But sex is never funnier when high school kids try it.",7,5,11,10 October 2007
Hot Fuzz," Romping, laugh-a-minute ode to all the Stallones, Segals and Norris' of this world.
","Attempting to parody the work of such uber-cheesy former actionites as Steven Segal and Chuck Norris is, on paper, such a redundant task, since most of those so-bad-they're-actually-quite-good action shoot-em-ups of the late 80s and early 90s were already teetering on the brink of self-ridicule. So how then, does Hott Fuzz, the new film from the makers of Shaun Of The Dead (2004), overcome a potential damp squib?The story goes like this: Dedicated London cop Nicholas Angell (Pegg), with a near perfect arrest record, is transferred to a small countryside village, where the crime rate is so excruciatingly low, that our hapless hero is reduced to being assigned to arresting the human statue in the town centre for loitering. All appears well, that is, until a series of grisly deaths appear to pile up around town, all of which are strangely linked to business entrepreneur Simon Skinner (Dalton). Although Angell continuously suspects the worst, that the town is being stalked by a vicious murderer, the rest of the rather apathetic police force choose to view the incidents as merely coincidences, taking both a blind eye and a lackadaisical approach to police detective work. Shaun Of The Dead managed to work, not so much by parodying the works of such horror auteurs as George A. Romero, but rather paying high tribute to the man, and his creations. The patented Pegg & Wright style of humour was there simply as an added bonus to hoards of zombies who roamed the rather mundane looking streets of suburban London. Hot Fuzz takes that cue, and pots in the very same way. But my affections for this film greatly outweighed their previous project for three simple reasons. Firstly, having a bottle-smashing, trolley-romping, gun-blazing shootout in the middle of a Somerfield supermarket is funny just passively thinking about it. Secondly, Simon Pegg fly-kicking the hell out of a shotgun-touting OAP is about the funniest thing you are likely to see all year. But the main reason is much more broad: Hot Fuzz is in love with the Chuck Norris' of this world. The fact that it shows this much passion and unapologetic enthusiasm for the over-muscled, hyper-realised cheese-infested beefcakes of latter 20th century Hollywood, is what provides this film with the icing on the cake. At the same time ¬ñ Pegg and Wright do not let the laughs let up for one second. This is very much a case of if you missed that last gag, don't worry there will another one along shortly. Timothy Dalton plays the villainous antagonist with so much evil suavity you kind of wait for him to start cackling and stroking his beard, but seeing him in this just made me realised how long it had been before he did anything actually worth noticing. And there are various cameos from a pick-em selection of Britain's finest comedy acts, ranging from Bill Bailey and Steve Coogan, to serious thesps like Edward Woodward, Jim Broadbent and Paddy Considine. The final 25 minutes of Hot Fuzz is kind of what Midsummer Murders might look like if John Woo had directed an episode of it. And the grand old daddy of action cinema would be proud. This is top quality British comedy, and in my opinion, even surpasses the laughter ratio on Shaun Of The Dead.",7,1,2,16 February 2007
Brokeback Mountain," Beautiful, heartbreaking romance
","Forget all the hype and hoopla you MAY have heard about Ang Lee's latest. This is not the controversial, left field gay western that it was originally advertised as, and which Ang Lee is desperate to eradicate. This is simply a beautiful, heartbreaking romance about two people who find each other in an unforgiving world. And they don't know what to do about it. In the summer of 1963 two cowboys by the name of Ennis Del Mar (A shockingly superb Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) meet at a ranch in Montana. Amidst the vast nowhere of the rocky mountains, these two form a strong relationship, that develops into an affair. However, this new found love is one that neither man is prepared to comprehend straight away. One drunken night of passion, leads to both men barely able to look at each other in the morning. How did this happen? They both reckon they're not homosexual. 'I ain't queer' Ennis proclaims, somewhat fretfully to Jack. 'Neither am I' retorts Jack. As far as these two men are concerned, what happens on the mountain, stays on the mountain. And so the affair continues, much to the chagrin of their disgusted boss (Played by Randy Quaid).As the years grow on, the two men appear to get on without each other. Both men get married, and even have children. But then one day they meet up again. And everything is compromised. Jack, ever the optimist, wants them to leave their wives and live together. Ennis, the realist, however, knows that an unforgiving society, especially in such a masculine environment, would never accept them together. So their secret affair continues, under the nose of their suspecting wives and friends.Brokeback Mountain may sound like an exploitation movie. Or indeed one about acceptance. But whilst it touches on these issues, it's really about something a lot more familiar in movies: Loss. Redemption. And Regret. It may be a western about homosexuality, and the taboo of it. But make no mistake. These are just two people who want to love each other. And that's the real tragedy of it. But that's not to say it is recurrent of films gone by. Far from it. Ang Lee has constructed a patient film, that deals with modern issues in a way that is much more reminiscent of Casablanca rather than the Rocky Horror Picture Show.If I have any criticism, it is that some people may find the film a tad too languid. Lee expects the audience to concentrate with this. You can put the Times' crossword puzzle away. Heath Ledger deserves an Oscar for his moody, subtle depiction of pent-up aggression. It is a fine, and very surprising performance from someone who is clearly destined for great things. Jake Gyllenhaal who in the past has done fantastic work, and has the label of the best actor of his generation is almost as great, with a brighter eyed performance.You will be touched and heartbroken, but will walk away glad. This is a film everyone should see.",8,16,18,12 January 2006
Juno," Smart, charming and daring comedy
","The supposed taboo of teenage pregnancy is tackled full on in this smartly-written but still hugely enjoyable comedy. Rising star Ellen Page plays Juno, the girl in question, who discovers that she is pregnant at the age of 16. At first, she wants to abort it, but soon decides the best thing to do is give it up for adoption. Written by Diablo Cody, who has gained mass amounts of publicity for her previous career as an exotic dancer, Juno combines jug-loads of wit and charm with a brilliant cast featuring the ever watchable JK Simmons as the smart-but-firm father, Jennifer Garner as the uptight but well-meaning adopter-mother and Michael Cerna, who carries over his awkward nerd shtick, perfected in such laugh-a-thons as TV cult series Arrested Development and gross-out comedy Superbad. Although some have complained the dialogue is unrealistically smart for pre-graduate high-schoolers, you will lose yourself in the story too much to bother caring.",8,3,7,16 April 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Overlong, over-hyped, overblown, undisciplined mess of a movie. I have never got the Pirates Of The Caribbean phenomenon and I never will
","Whip out your cutlass, put on your eye-patches, feed your parrots and fetch up a bottle of Malibu or two. Yes it is that time of year again, the time when I say 'Oh god, not this tripe again' and stomach another movie featuring a cesspool of floundering talent awash in the midst of a franchise vehemently sailing way out of control. It is Pirates Of The Caribbean, the most overrated, overlong, over-hyped and damn well irritating movie trilogy since the Star Wars prequels. A throwback to the late 1950s style of TV-counter cinema that said to hell with logic, convention or narrative cohesion, films need to be really long, really grandiose and utterly overblown. And this time, it is the dark side of those pesky pirate dwellers, as the opening scenes of serf hangings suggests a much more mephitic aura to the film. That is, until a certain Johnny Depp turns up.Continuing much in the same vein as the second instalment of the POTC franchise, At World's End has no plot. Or rather it has 28 different plots, all of which are almost entirely incomprehensible. The first quest of note is the one to rescue Captain Jack Sparrow, last seen tickling the throat of that huge great Kraken at the end of Dead Man's Chest. After they have done that, they must call the Pirate lords from all four corners of the globe, including Captain Barbossa (Rush), Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), Sao Feng (Yun-Fat) and a whole host of culture-clashing pirates. Meanwhile, Lord Cutler Beckett is still searching for Will Turner, Elizabeth Swan and Captain Jack Sparrow, in the hope that he will be able to execute them all himself.The first Pirates Of The Caribbean was an entertaining mess, the second film was a sporadically enjoyable mess. Third time around it is just a mess. After the film's opening we are introduced to the new bad guy, Sao Fen, played by Chow Yun-Fat. Chow made his name with ultra-violent John Woo actioners, and as he rambles this boring Singapore bad-guy drivel, all I could think was how I wished he would just whip out a Beretta, an Uzi and a pump-handle shotgun and just shoot the hell out of absolutely everything that moves. This is a movie in desperate need of some John Woo-style mayhem. We are then re-acquainted with Captain Jack Sparrow, who appears to have gone bonkers by himself in the land of the dead. We are now treated to the sight of multiple Jack Sparrows all vying for position as the Captain of the black pearl. All the worst since Depp's space jockeying has become completely absurd. Then there's the drawn out love between Elizabeth Swan and Orlando. In fairness to Keira Knightley, she does her best under the circumstances, but Orlando Bloom is just not good enough for a romantic lead. His version of acting is, if you are a bit angry, turn the volume up. If you are a bit said, turn the volume down. But under no circumstances will you stretch your precious face beyond its lovely unwrinkled borders. He is almost transparent for this movie, as the huge concoction of 'stuff' that happens all over the screen never allows his weak talents to shine through.If, like me, you are thoroughly bored with Johnny Depp's gravitationally challenged pirate shtick, the film's only saving grace is the fairly spectacular final ship battle. There are cannons blazing, swords clashing, rain raging down and explosions galore. Yet even this is spoilt by a ridiculous moment of infancy, when Will Turner decides to pop the question to Ms Swan in the middle of a huge sword fight. It is this moment that sums the film up for me. It is too grizzly for young kids, but too infantile for gown-ups. It is almost the money-stroking filmmakers way of saying 'to hell with logic, we think its funny, so what?' I have never gotten the fascination the Pirates Of The Caribbean franchise. It is ridiculously overlong, woefully directed, badly acted and spectacularly undisciplined. I don't get people's fascination with Johnny Depp's one-joke note performance, made even more insufferable by a self-knowing cameo by Keith Richards as the old drunk's father. I really don't get how Gore Verbinski has become the single most profitable director of our generation grossing well over a billion dollars with his films. I don't doubt that, like the first two, At World's End will take a ridiculous amount of money, and cause a huge wave of Jack Sparrow hysteria. Nor do I doubt that the very same people that were bowled over by the first two movies will embrace At World's End in much the same vein. But as far as I am concerned, this is just not good enough. Not for my summer blockbusters, and not for my pockets. And if people continue to humour Jerry Bruckheimer, by giving him the box office figures he is more than used to, you will not only encourage him to do it again, but you will damage the reputation of all those involved with this mess, but you will encourage them all to do it again. Hollywood will only work as hard as they need to, and a profitable movie is more important to them than art, entertainment, or the movie industry as a whole.",5,0,2,25 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," Hyped to hell, this falls way short of the Spider-Man standards set. Still, you'd be hard pressed not to forgive these characters
","Spider-Man gets all emo and bad ass at the same time with the introduction of 'evil black space goo'. This time, he must duel with the Sandman, Green Goblin and Venom, as the movie, literally, loses the plot. I could try and explain it to you, but it would make The Big Sleep sound like Snakes On A Plane. The basic thread is Spider-Man discovers his dark side, after being infected with a black substance from outer-space. It causes him to stop combing his hair, do a ridiculous 'impression' of John Travolta from Saturday Night Fever and generally act like a horny sixth-former. It also greatly increases his violent tendencies, as he shows no remorse pummelling some of his enemies to their apparent deaths. In the mean time, Mary Jane is failing as an actress, and getting kidnapped every now and again. Her relationship with Peter is once again strained, which has a lot to do with the introduction of Gwen Stacey, another potential love foil.The first two Spider-Man movies were underwhelming, in terms of spectacle (Spider-Man 2 less so). The CGI had always been ropey, the dialogue reeked of cheese, and much of the action was disappointingly pedestrian. What the series had going for it was its heart and faith in the characters. It was never really about Spider-Man but Peter Parker, who struggled with his identity in the last film, only to come clean to Mary Jane at the end. Spider-Man 3 aspires to the same level of drama, with none of the reward. The plot is completely incomprehensible and having three bad guys wander in and out of the film's narrative only serves to make matters more confusing. Firstly, why do we need the sandman? There is nothing scary about a man who can turn into a beach, whether he is played by Thomas Haden Church or not. Secondly, whenever a character suffers from Amnesia, it is usually a film-making short cut so we can go over ground already trampled upon in the past. And that is exactly what happens here. Thirdly ¬ñ Venom is played by Topher Grace, the single most annoying actor in the world. If you had ever read the comics or even seen the animated series of Spider-Man, you would know that Venom is meant to be scary as hell. Yet listening to him talk like a racquetball-playing yuppy, albeit occasionally screeching, just made me think what he really needs is a nice cappuccino and a Apple laptop to put his photos on.The film's saving graces are all down to director Sam Raimi and leading player Tobey Maguire. Raimi has always been good at placing comedy in his films, and there are a couple of really funny moments, involving Bruce Campbell in a hilarious cameo, and JK Simmons doing JJ Jameson, the newspaper editor from hell shtick, he does so well. Also, the action isn't half bad either. There is an absolutely spectacular sequence involving a humongous crane pillaging through the side of a skyscraper, only for Spider to come to the rescue. But at a reported $258 million (that's fifty million than Titanic) it does not justify its price or hype. There are only so many times we can witness Mary Jane get kidnapped before it becomes numbing. Tobey Maguire does his best, as always. And does nothing to disserve the drama of the piece. But considering just how good this could have been, it really wasn't worth the hype.",6,0,0,25 May 2007
Zodiac," Stylish, compelling, gripping work
","David Fincher attempted to comprehend the mindset of the serial killer in his 1995 hit serial killer movie Seven. Zodiac ¬ñ his latest film ¬ñ focuses much more intently on those obsessively attempting to hunt the killer down. Based on the true story of the 'Zodiac killer' of the late 1960s, Zodiac stars Jake Gyllenhaal as cartoonist Robert Graysmith, who really worked for the San Francisco Chronical in the late 1960s, and throughout the 70s. After a teenage couple are brutally attacked and shot by an unknown assailant in the quiet outskirts of Vallejo, California, a coded letter is sent to both the San Francisco Chornical and the police. Unable to decrypt the enigmatic letter, top crime beat reporter, Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.), is helped by political cartoonist Graysmith who, despite not being directly involved in the Zodiac story, has a varied knowledge of puzzle solving, and manages to recognise the letter from old zodiac signs. Meanwhile, the Zodiac killer begins a year long murder spree, in which at least five people died at his hands, all the while taunting police and the media through his ciphered letters. The investigation is led by Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo), who engulfs himself knee-deep into the case, before realising he is following a cold trail. It is at this juncture, that Graysmith decides to follow his own in-depth investigation, much to the anguish of his wife and family.Although the movie starts by showing us the grizzly series of murders, Zodiac very quickly settles down to explore the lives of those who become obsessed with capturing the enigmatic serial killer. At times the movie focuses on the reporting side of the story, and then quickly shifts to the case itself, involving the detectives hunting him down personally. When the case becomes stagnant, and Avery loses his grip on the job, only Graysmith continues to fight for any semblance of a revelation. Day and night, he entraps himself in a world of clues and codes, turning his back on his family, his job and even his own sense of reality.David Fincher's film does an excellent job of asking the question of at what point does intrigue become obsession. Although it doesn't appear to be as flashy and stylised as Fincher's previous work, his clever use of CGI and editing techniques are every bit as nuanced as the likes of Seven and Fight Club. There is one terrific scene where we follow a cab through the streets of San Francisco, pre-murder - from the birdseye view. Fincher's use of music also contributes to both the atmosphere of the piece, and the cultural era we venture back to. Fincher moves tautfully from the late sixties, right through to the seventies, with verve and cultural awareness for the times we re-visit. But for all of Fincher's neo-auteuristic flourishes, the other major factor that sets Zodiac above any other crime film this year is its fantastic cast. Jake Gyllenhaal may be the future of Hollywood, but he has already conquered the here and now for intellectual, unorthodox leading men. Mark Ruffalo once again shows everyone just why he is so underrated as an actor. And a whole host of supporting players, including Brian Cox, Elias Coteas and Anthony Edwards ensure there are few gaps left to fill. The only damp spot would be Robert Downey Jr., whose showy performance as Paul Avery is far too often given the Downey Jr caricature treatment that effects so much of his work. But for the most part this is grade A stuff all round. At two and a half hours it is a long ride, but at no point did I feel the running time. Seven was his breakout, Zodiac is David Fincher's monolith.",8,1,2,12 July 2007
The Prestige," Outstanding. Yet another in Christopher Nolan's increasingly heavy bag of tricks that'll leave you begging the question 'How does he do it?'
","Obsession, a theme dealt with countless times before, is never one that grows old in narrative cinema. We see it manifest itself in almost every genre, from epic crime sagas like Michael Mann's Heat (1995) to anti-eroticism like David Cronenberg's Crash (1996), such is its generic influence. The Prestige, the latest from wunderkid Christopher Nolan, is a movie very much rooted in obsession, but more importantly how in-human people are willing to go in order to feed there obsession. Hugh Jackman plays Robert Angier, a wannabe-magician, and brilliant showman whose trickster talents are sadly lacking the amazement that Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) enriches his magic with. Borden, meanwhile, lacks the showmanship of Angier, and can only sell his act for its amazement, in spite of its wizardry. Beginning their careers as apprentices, both Angier and Borden work with each other at first, but as is established early on in Nolan's film, their friendship turns to rivalry, and inevitably in death, as the non-linear narrative establishes early on that Borden has been charged with the murder of Angier's character, and sentenced to a jail cell. Yet not is all as it seems, as the twisted nature of the plot keeps the audience firmly on their toes throughout the proceedings.Despite its period setting, very seldom do we get a sense of visual history. Nolan isn't interested in wetting our appetites for milieu, but rather treats this for what it is: a complex character study. It may be 19th century England but that doesn't mean we don't get hand-held camera shots or contemporary music (at least when the credits start to roll). As Michael Caine's character Cutter rightfully points out, 'Obsession is a young man's game'. Both Borden and Angier are willing to sacrifice themselves in order to be the best magician there is. But only the one who never lets up from their act for a second will truly succeed. This obsession is what keeps us, the viewers, guessing from start to finish. We are never entirely sure who has the upper hand in this war of wizardry, which is part of the puzzling enjoyment of this utterly compelling piece of work. The Prestige constantly hoodwinks its audience from beginning to end, with its various twists and turns that, in that Christopher Nolan kind of way, never quite give you all the pieces to the puzzle. But the more he hides from his audience, the more we become intrigued, querying the complex narrative as much as Angier obsesses over Borden's talents.Whilst The Prestige is a complex film at the best of times, the borderline between puzzling and baffling is rarely crossed. In the same way that Nolan's previous masterpiece Memento (2001) took full advantage of the jumpy nature of its unique narrative, The Prestige goes as far as flashing back from within a flash back. It is an instance of cinema that creates enjoyment out of its complexity, rather than sheer confusion, as Nolan manages to unravel the intricate non-linear narrative in a superbly told way. The weight of the performances also plays a part in marking this film's brilliance. Jackman, whose talents had previously been hidden behind flashy special effects, delivers a great performance of a man every bit as obsessed with his work as he is with Borden. Christian Bale is fast emerging as one of the most talented leading men those Hollywood posses. Yet the outstanding performance in the film is arguably Michael Caine, who possesses a tower of screen presence as the adviser and mentor of both men. It is perhaps a shame then that Scarlett Johansson's performance, as the in-between lover of both men, only seems to come alive when her English accent starts to wane. It is not so much a bad performance as it is an inappropriately reserved one, with all her effort in perfecting the London twang draining any weight from her natural screen presence. Yet whatever small quibble one might have of this film is only trivial, as this is clearly one of the best films of the year so far. Whilst the presence of David Bowie is enough to sink any movie, the sheer dramatic power generated by Nolan's film is enough to drown out any flaws, few as they may be, from foiling this magic trick. This is without question one of the best films of the year. Is Oscar watching?",8,1,2,9 November 2006
Cloverfield," Rip-roaringly entertaining
","In this rip-roaring, home-movie styled monster movie a group of teenager partying for the departure of one their closest friends find themselves amid a blaze of destruction when a giant 'thing' starts ripping the city to shreds. One of the unlucky scamps happens to be filming the entire thing, and thus we get a faux-documentary much in the style of a megabucks version of The Blair Witch Project meets Godzilla. Although the shaky camera and choice of the 1st person view may put off some viewers who suffer from motion sickness, Cloverfield for the most part is barnstorming entertainment, fully exploiting the resources available to it. The idea to shoot entirely from some poor sap's camera is not entirely original, dating back to the Italian cannibal movies of the early 80s. But it does make for an interesting take on the monster movie.",7,1,3,19 February 2008
Pan's Labyrinth," dark, twisted, sublime, wondrous and excellently made. This is a triumph of modern cinema.
","All your emotions will be thoroughly tested in Guillermo Del Toro's grim fairy tale. A masterful fable that alternates between uber-gritty realism and dark, twisted fantasy with such a sublime slickness, it is near startling. A young woman by the name of Ofelia has just moved to rural Spain, with her sick, pregnant mother where her new husband, the slimy fascist Captain Vidal is currently holding his troops. Constantly under fire from partisan soldiers in the wooden hills, Vidal must attend to his wife whilst fighting for Franco's regime. Ofelia, meanwhile, is caught in a struggle to escape the grim realities of war-torn Spain. She is in love with stories, notably her fairy tales. One night, she is visited by a fairy, which brings her to the 'labyrinth'. A secret maze, run by a tall, tree-like faun. He calls her 'your highness' and a princess, and gives her tasks to complete for him, each one adding a new page to her empty fairytale book.Whilst from a distance Pan's Labyrinth may seem like a children's grim fairytale, it is anything but for children. The majority of the movie is far more concerned with Captain Vidal and his horrendous callousness to both his wife, his people and to the Spanish resistance. In a film that features a skinless monster with eyes in his hands, slowly creeping towards Ofelia as she avoids becoming the rancidly gravel-voiced demon's next dinner meal, Vidal is by far the most putrid thing on screen. A man who fears dreamers and thinkers, one of who just happens to be the innocent Ofelia. Her mother doesn't understand, nor does the Captain. It seems the only people she can turn to are the shrewd resistance-sympathising maid Mercedes (Maribel Verdu, of Y Tu Mama Tambien fame) and the faun himself.Do not be fooled. This is a movie about children, but not for children. There are at least two torture sequences, which despite being purely simplistic are every bit as masochistic as Saw or Casino Royale. The themes dealt with in Pan's Labyrinth are simple, yet adult ones, managing to mesh the contrast between fantasy and reality to startling effect. Every bit as wonderful and awe-inspiring as it is grim and melancholic ¬ñ you will be hard-pressed to find a better film this year.",9,8,16,25 November 2006
Knocked Up," The comedy of the year
","Inside every great dumb gross-out comedy is a smarter film just waiting burst out of that film's womb. In the case of Knocked Up, we have a movie that presents itself in the American Pie tradition of fart gags and sex jokes, but that has aspirations to higher levels of cinematic purity. LEvels where it isn't just teenage boys who are given permission to laugh at the screen. Or indeed teenagers at all. Judd Apatow, the film's director, is more Woody Allen than Porky's revenge. His movie's are filled with observational humour, cultural and societal situations and questions of morality when pregnancy is concerned. How should a man finally 'man up' when it is time to play the role of daddy-to-be, especially when his whole existence seems so peripheral, his claim to fame is a working part-time on a website that allows to find which movies your favourite actresses have been nude in?Seth Rogen plays Ben, a podgy, unemployed stoner-slob who lives in an apartment with four other similar friends. When at a club one night, he meets Alison, a recently-promoted TV presenter, who is initially charmed by the lovable oaf. Several empty beer bottles later, they end up spending the night together, only to discover their real personalities the morning after. During breakfast, Alison soon becomes repulsed by Ben's oafish opinions and demeanour, and soon decides it is best to leave the situation as a one night stand. Several weeks later Alison discovers she is pregnant, and decides to keep the baby. Without much thought into how she might achieve such a feet, she decides to give Ben another chance, for the sake of the baby, to make a relationship work between them.The great achievement of Knocked Up is that it is a comedy for adults, that has not been dumbed down for kids. Yes there are many crude jokes, similar to the filmmaker's previous effort - The 40 year Old Virgin. But the crudeness is shown up for what it is, and Ben's slacker routine is not glorified over Alison's sensibility. This is a movie where, like American Pie, the women have someone to look up to just like the men do. And a year in which American comedies have sunk so low that Will Ferrell is considered high-end, it is refreshing to see a new breed of smart filmmakers come out to give rebirth to the dumb comedy genre.",7,1,4,13 September 2007
Blades of Glory," It's not a masterpiece but you'll laugh all the way through it
","American comedy has taken a royal nosedive since the turn of the millennium. Jim Carrey went all thesp, Bill Murray forgot how to use his facial muscles (to great effect) and the only bankable comic stars were the ghastly Wayans Brothers, Adam Sandler and the 'frat pack'. Leading the pack was/is Will Ferrell, and his deluge of so-so comedies. Anchorman was alright, but everything since has kinda sucked. So along comes Blades OF Glory, a buddy-comedy about a couple of knuckleheads duking it out in the fierce sport of ice-skating. I could feel the groans coming on in my system, as 'Here' I thought, 'We'll have yet another comedy that makes a slew of gay jokes, this time about men having to wear latex tights and oggle other men in front of an audience'. No I was not looking forward to it. Shame then, because it is very funny when it wants to be. From start to finish I was never low on larfs, particularly in the incredibly slow and awkward shopping mall chase. Jon Heder, he out of dynamite, provides able support, proving that movie was no flash-in-the pan, and there are many moments where Will Ferrell's previously annoying flapping-your-arms-about-the-place routine is actually very well placed here. It may not be Fellini, but it skates all over Talladega Nights.",6,0,0,5 May 2007
The Polar Express," A magical ride
","The Polar Express might be trying to encourage kids to believe back in Santa Claus, yet you might even believe in the characters of Robert Zemeckis' film, such is the astonishing feat of CG animation. When a young boy stops believing in the jolly old red man, a magical train comes to visit him in the night, promising to take him, as well as several other children, to the North Pole on Christmas Eve. What then ensues is as fun a ride as any kid could hope to have, as we are treated to a whole host of action-packed sequences, which have double the effect if you are watching The Polar Express 3D. There might not be much depth or characterisation in this film, and the elves are about as annoying as anything at Christmas can be. But there is far too much magic on screen for the full 90 minutes for anyone to care.",7,1,3,21 December 2006
Nacho Libre," Really Good Fun
","'I ate some bugs, I ate some grass I used my hand to wipe my tears' so sings Jack Black just before he is about to risk life and limb against Mexico's finest masked mat-magician. Indeed there are at least two occasions during Nacho Libre where our portly protagonists bursts into song the rest of the movie could have been complete pants yet these two moments of comedic brilliance would have, at least, made the trip half enjoyable. I usually hate comedy songs - indeed the worst moments in the hit TV show Family Guy are always when the characters decide to drown out the humour with verse - yet Jack Black manages to make these moments the highlight of his films. Throw in a few pairs of stretchy pants, an incredibly thin tag team partner and some psycho midget wolf Wrestlers and you have yourself a pretty darn funny movie. Most of the time, anyway.Black plays Nacho, a soup jockey working in a rural Mexican monastery. He serves horrible looking meals, Oliver Twist style, to a collection of orphans. Fed up, he decides to pursue a career of lucha libre, seeking out a tag team partner, in the mould of thief-cum-really skinny tramp Esqueleto (H√©ctor Jim√©nez). All well and swell except his monastery doesn't approve of luchadores, so he must keep this a secret from his fellow monks and nuns. One particular nun, Encarnacion (Ana de la Reguera), becomes the object of Nacho's desires which is an obvious conundrum to the man. They share toast together, although Nacho is careful not to reveal his secret.Some things in movies are just funny: fart gags, midgets and Jack Black singing. It doesn't take a genius to pull these types of gags off, which is inevitably why most of the film's funniest gags are from the front man of Tenacious D. Jared Hess' previous claim to fame was Napoleon Dynamite which, although incredibly funny in parts, wasn't half deadpan. He decides to stick with that style for his latest project and although it is interesting to see that kind of straight-faced humour mixed with the dirt and weirdness of Hess' vision of Mexico, it was probably not the best way to tell this kind of story. Audience reactions were far higher when Black was allowed to run amuck with his wide-eyed shtick. Nacho Libre may not be the cleverest film in the world, but it doesn't spare on the laughs. Consistently amusing, occasionally hilarious, you shouldn't be disappointed.",6,0,0,22 August 2006
Capote," Great performances, flawed story.
","Bennett Miller, long time friend of Philip Seymour Hoffman, adapts this tale of legendary writer Truman Capote's struggle to write the great American novel. After becoming good friends with one of the Clutter killers, Capote proceeds to manipulate anyone and everyone in order to aid his new book In Cold Blood, including Alvin Dewey, one of the FBI investigators on the killings. Whilst talking to Perry Smith - one of the convicted killers - Capote forms a bond with the young man, and convinces him that he will attempt to help his case whichever way he can. He's lying of course, the book is entitled In Cold Blood, his interest could only be a purely selfish one.What's good about Capote doesn't necessarily make it an intriguing experience. Philip Seymour Hoffman, now one Oscar up, is fantastic as the man himself, nailing all of Capote's mannered traits, yet is never sympathetic enough for us to truly feel sorry for him. Catherine Keener, who brilliantly plays Harper Lee - Capote's closest en-trustee - finishes her masterpiece To Kill A Mockingbird, and yet Capote barely even notices. Why should we care if he sympathises with a killer?!? The portrayal of Perry Smith is questionable. Miller's film shows him to be a mild-mannered man who regrets his actions, despite the real Capote saying he thought the real Smith enjoyed killing the Clutter family. Capote is worth watching to see the struggles that the protagonist goes through whilst agonising over his 'non-fiction novel'. He neglects everyone, from his partner to his friends, in order to get to the bottom of his masterpiece. He never completed another book after this one, descending into a celebrity lifestyle of booze-cruising and wise-cracking.In the end Capote is too esoteric. If you have no interest in journalism, the process of writing or of Truman Capote himself, then Bennett Miller's film won't exactly send the taste buds tingling. It's well played, if a tad too slow, and certainly has it's moments. A slow film about a unsympathetic man. Capote is worth seeing for it's performances at least.",6,1,2,8 March 2006
Ocean's Thirteen," Silly it is, but Ocean's Thirteen is funnier and visually more pleasing than Ocean's Twelve
","In the third instalment of this glossy franchise, heist-mogul-turned hotel entrepreneur Reuben (Gould) finds himself double-crossed out of a deal to open a new hotel-casino on the Las Vegas strip, by evil co-dealer Willy Banks (Pacino). This lands Reuben in hospital after a near fatal heart attack. After hearing of the deal, Danny and his crew decide to exact revenge on Banks by sabotaging the grand opening of his new venture. Perhaps what Ocean's Twelve lacked was the glossy (although admittedly tacky) aesthetic that Las Vegas rewarded the first film with. Because even when Ocean's Thirteen doesn't quite work, such as during the odd faux-romance scenes between Ellen Barkin and Matt Damon, at least the scenery jumps out at you. Yes Clooney, Pitt, Pacino and Soderbergh are way better than this - but the movie is fun, and in comparison with the utter mess that was Ocean's Twelve, it's nothing but a sprightly addition to a series that has probably run its course.",6,0,1,19 August 2007
The Devil Wears Prada," Not quite a size 6, but it's personality might just win you over
","The fashion industry: The giver and taker away of all things 'in' and religion to every insecure, under-fed teen girl (and sometimes guy) in the western world is given a right smack (but never more so than that) in David Frankel's sometime satire. Anne Hathaway plays Andy, a smiley young girl who moves to New York in order to move up the fashion world. Her goal is journalism, but her right of passage is through assisting the cold, maliciously cruel fashion editor Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep, doing a po-faced Cruella Deville). She soon realises that the industry is cruel, shallow and incredibly undignified. Will she fall foul of it's devilish charms and superficial face, or keep her charm amidst a glamorous indecorum?The fashion industry, at its worst, is absolutely monstrous. It gives birth to terrible self-indulgence, unhealthy lifestyles, immoral role models and hideous insecurity. Whilst The Devil Wears Prada does its best to caricature the embodiment of the fashion world, by having Miranda Priestly make mince meat out of her assistants, and those assistance being every bit as self-conscious and docile to her demands, it is never as savage as it needs to be to show up the beauty obsessed world. Miranda Priestly is as delicious a villainess as you'd like her to be, but her actions don't portray the true shark that we know exists in that office. She's a one-dimensional cartoon first, and satirical allegory second. Take a film like Swimming For Sharks (1994) for instance ¬ñ Kevin Spacey's movie boss is every bit as snarling and callous as Miranda, but with a vicious honesty that chokes out the niceties attached to The Devil Wears Prada. Whereas Mean Girls (2003) showed how a character can be sucked in to a world through vengeance, but end up just as nasty as her enemies, Andy is never truly swayed by everyone else's superficiality. At the start of the movie she doesn't define herself by her clothes, but half way through she turns into Kate Moss. She becomes obsessed with her work, and alienates her incredibly uninteresting boyfriend. She even flirts with other fashion designers, but then that's only human of her. Does she become a monster like some other critics have suggested? Not on your life. Her charming smile follows her right throughout Frankel's picture, never letting up despite the constant abuse thrown her way.But whilst it may lack a bite or two, there's nothing terribly wrong with this film. It is consistently entertaining, if predictable at times, has some ripe old performances ¬ñ Stanley Tucci steals every scene his in ¬ñ and is generally a feel good couple of hours. Is the satire reminiscent of Wall Street (1987)? Certainly not. But if you liked Sex & The City, you'll love this. There is, however, a much darker film yet to be made about this subject.",6,0,0,6 October 2006
The Bourne Ultimatum," Furiously paced action thriller
","Attach a camera to a stampeding bison and convolute his bulrush with a myriad of flaming obstacles. Lend the scene some gritty urbane shades of grey and you might just get a sense of what watching The Bourne Ultimatum is like. It is the third and final instalment of the best Hollywood trilogy since Lord Of The Rings. A cataclysm of chase sequences all brought together through an incredibly well managed story of searching for identity. Jason Bourne is now closer to finding out the truth than ever before. But those who rely on secrets and lies fully intend to make sure he never does. His journey brings him from Moscow (where we left off from Supremacy) to London, Tangiers and finally New York. Our main man has kept himself busy, amid trying to solve the riddle of why so many want him dead.Paul Greengrass may just be the finest director working in Hollywood at the moment. After the admirably harrowing exercise in recreating the brave but doomed lives of those aboard United 93 last year, Greengrass has returned to what brought him mainstream acclaim, with Matt Damon as the man with many names. He is Jason Bourne, a man who pulsates his way through the journey faster than the camera can catch him, dispatching of his enemies in skilfully undetectable panache. He is the anti-James Bond, a man who achieves his goals through relentless determination but secretly just wants to let it all go and get back to being a normal person. Greengrass manages to capture the unclothed torture that occasionally surfaces in Bourne's demeanour during the film. In the few scenes between the break-neck action set-pieces it is almost as if Greegrass has been studying the characters' biorhythms, as the camera learily explores the meaning of a tapping finger, or a nervous twitch of an eye. The faux-documentary style allows for the camera to be as intimate as possible when needs be, and as explosively dynamic too. It is that wonderful mirage of cinematic excursions that lend The Bourne Ultimatum a sense of intimacy and substance. But that is not all that gives the movie its edge. Indeed it has political undertones too, with one brilliant sequence inside Waterloo station exploring the effects of being watched through CCTV. Not so much being watched, but who controls the cameras. Secondly, those who attempt to assassinate Bourne are all under the banner of the CIA, and references aplenty are made to waterboarding, black ops and rendition, as if the movie is questioning the humanity of those methods.But the real stars of the show are the incredible action chases. Whether it is the roof jumping in Tangiers, or the car chase in New York, The Bourne Ultimatum is never short of being unrelenting. No other director could ever perfect this pace, for anything faster would be overkill, and anything less would diluting the frenetic energy that charges the movie screen. Greengrass is a master at roping his audience in and never letting go of that leverage. He can take the most basic of action sequences like a man running and make it feel like a helicopter exploding. Whether it is too frenetic or not, the one thing that is impossible to feel is boredom. Even the rare tender scenes are utterly compelling in their delivery. This is Matt Damon's finest work. He has always had a fluctuating career in terms of quality, despite being a very bankable star in the process. But his subtle raggedness, and penchant for looking unperturbed in the face of great danger is what makes Bourne seem like the classic no-man. He is an anomaly in terms of James Bond bewitchery, but perfect for the role of Jason Bourne ¬ñ handsome, rugged and steely eyed. Not a flicker of doubt ever crosses his mind whilst fighting for the truth. And not a flicker of doubt ever crossed mine when reviewing this film.",8,4,6,1 October 2007
American Pie," Hilarious Porky's style fun
","It certainly has a lot to answer for. The various duplicates Hollywood managed to fart out in it's wake - some pretty good (Orange County) most excremental (Van Wilder) - might force even the most easily tickled specimen to rethink American Pie's worth. I can safely assume most of them would still think it one of the best gross-out comedies ever. It it probably always will be that sub-genre's Citizen Kane.Whereas the likes of Animal House and Fast Times At Ridgemount High were more of an amusing observation of various deadbeats and juveniles, American Pie manages to find heart in it's characters. I still love John Belushi's impression of a zit, don't get me wrong. But I think American Pie's compassion is what gives the cake it's icing - that and Eugene Levy (I wish he was my dad :D). Jim (Jason Biggs)'s attempted conquest of foreign exchange student Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) is certainly cringe-worthy but never crass. We like Jim. We want him to succeed. He's definitely somewhat of a dumbo, but not a complete fool. And for once the female characters have a healthy balance of sexual attitude, which in the past was mostly about guys trying to catch them changing.Don't get it twisted. This is a rude and crude comedy, with some great gags and a few stock characters that we didn't need. Some of the films worst moments involve Chris 'make a table out of me now' Klein attempting to shed his jock image to reveal his sensitive side, which apparently involves joining the choir and then singing and dancing in the male showers. For all the gross gags in the film, this was certainly the most vomit-inducing. But apart from that there isn't much to complain about.Easily offended? Probably not for you. For the rest of us though, this is unadulterated hilarity, with a side order of sweet.",7,0,1,15 February 2006
28 Weeks Later," Raging good fun
","No one does post-apocalyptic films like Britain, and 28 Weeks Later is no exception. The film begins with a group of refugees hidden away in a shack somewhere in the English countryside. The plague outbreak is still running rampant, so they take every precaution possible. Among those shacked up are Robert Carlyle and his wife. Unfortunately, the rage-infected killers find their way to the shack and begin proceeding to bang their way in. Rather than staying to fight, Carlyle leaves his wife and companions and runs away. 28 weeks later, London is declared a 'safe zone' by a NATO-lead American force, who are now occupying the city. The area of the Isle of Dogs is now a large refuge camp, with heavy military occupation. The outer limits of London are still not 'safe', although Britain itself has been declared under a system of 'containment'. You don't have to be a genius to work out the parallels between the film and the US-lead occupation of Iraq. The US army have set up a reconstruction policy of 'containment' where a set of land is considered a 'safe zone' when it clearly isn't. When all hell breaks lose, it is not just the hoards of rage-infected beasts that are terrorising the refugees.28 Weeks Later is splattertastic stuff. The action is frenetic, the gore is unrelenting and the horror is full on. The real treat of all this is seeing it take place in around the east London docklands. Watching hundreds of bloodthirsty killers raging through canary wharf, the millennium dome and the grain and dirt of those factory-outlet areas, we are treated to a vision of London that is all to often glossed over. It has meat, both subtextually and masochistically. It even has a cameo by the docklands light railway. For some gorrific entertainment, you can't go wrong with 28 Weeks Later.",7,2,6,25 May 2007
21," cool, sassy fun
","21 is the kind of movie that ensures you even if your knowledge and tolerance of card games is zilch and thin, that they are sexed up enough to keep you watching. Ben Campbell is a young student, with a genius-like understanding of numeracy. This interests his lecturer (Kevin Spacey, clearly on weekend night-shift form) who assembles a crack team of young geniuses, including Kate Bosworth as a rocket scientist (don't laugh), to rip-off the Vegas casinos through card-counting. The movie's intellect never aspires to the level of it's subjects, but the visual aesthetics and bouncy tone are enough to wet even the most ardent of anti-gamblers' appetites.",6,0,0,3 May 2008
Little Miss Sunshine," Consistently funny even if some of the jokes are retreads
","After the regional winner of the 'Little Miss Sunshine' pageant is withdrawn, young Olive Hoover (splendidly played by Abigail Breslin) is invited to Redondo Beach, in order to take part in the national beauty competition for pre-teens. Only she has two problems: (a) her family are too broke to fly there and (b) due to various circumstances, the road trip requires all barmy combatants of the family to travel as well. Among them includes the heroine-addicted grandpa (Alda), older brother Dwayne (Dano), who has taken a vow of silence until he reaches his goal of becoming a navy pilot, and her suicidal gay uncle Frank (Carell, playing against type) who has to be monitored at all times. And, of course, they encounter any number of problems and mishaps along the way. Whilst the movie ends on a misjudged elaborate comic set piece, for the most part Little Miss Sunshine is consistently funny, if not nearly as acerbic as it could have been. This is thanks largely to both Alan Alda, as the foul-mouthed, bawdy grandpa who says whatever the hell he likes, and Greg Kinnear as a relentless self-improving dad, and failed motivational speaker.",7,6,11,11 November 2006
The Orphanage," Masterfully terrifying
","This hauntingly brilliant horror film stars Belen Rueda as Laura, a woman who brings her family back to her childhood home in order to re-open it as an orphanage. Once there, her son's imagination is reawakened by the home, but his childhood fantasies and games become sinister when his 'imaginary' friends may not be so imaginary after all. Unlike many modern horror films, Juan Antonio Bayona does not wash the cinema screen with explicit torture candy, but rather skilfully weaves cinematic shocks through intrigue and suspense. His movie is all the more terrifying for what it does not show than for what it actually reveals. And there are at least four big moments that will leave you trembling in your seat, if you have not already jumped out of it.",8,7,11,30 April 2008
Over the Hedge," Fun
","Suburbia is lightly satirised in this enjoyable, if flimsy, new animated effort from Dreamworks. After getting caught in the act of stealing ¬ñ and subsequently destroying ¬ñ the possessions of a hibernating bear, a raccoon by the name of RJ has one week to retrieve the items, or else he becomes supper. Along his plight he encounters a group of fuzzy, wacky wood-bound friends, all of whom have awoken from hibernation. After conning them into helping him, they venture off 'over the hedge' in search of food, encountering dogs, televisions and SUVs ('How many people does it hold? 'Usually just one') along the way.Whilst the movie does take a few clever digs at modern day suburbia, Over The Hedge is never truly biting enough to really hold the adult's attention. The animation, gags and characters are all perfectly fine, whilst never being truly memorable. It is the kind of movie that will keep your kids entertained long enough so they don't bug you about buying them the latest hand-held console or cry over spilt ice cream. There are certainly enough fart gags, and wacky set-pieces to have them laughing all the way through this film, but in the end, you come out feeling fairly ordinary. None of the characters, whether it be the lead in RJ (A somewhat miscast Bruce Willis ) or the supporting cast like Hammy the Squirrel (Steve Carell) are particularly memorable, in the way that Pixar's classics like Toy Story or Finding Nemo boasted wonderful creations, both visually and vocally, like Mr Potato Head or Sheldon the Turtle. In short, it is a movie far too light to really stick in too many kids minds once they have left the cinema.Yet despite the obvious ephemeralness of it all Over The Hedge doesn't really strive to be narratively wonderful like Toy Story, which deals with the idea of losing one's childhood, or even Spirited Away, dealing with confronting responsibility, whilst being wonderfully dark. With this kind of flimsy set-up and the forgettable nature of the characters, this is an amusing way to spend time with the kids. You would be hard pressed to dislike the film, but you won't love it. Which I think is a shame, given the precedents both Pixar and Dreamworks had set themselves after Shrek and Toy Story.",6,0,0,19 July 2006
Dreamgirls," A fun, technically accomplished, lavish musical with enough soul to prevent you from getting the blues.
","'Music is supposed to sell' claims Jamie Foxx's dead-faced music producer when staring in the face of the physically unappealing but vocally rip-roaring Effie White. Such is the power of Jennifer Hudson's voice box, it is staggering to learn that she only finished 8th or 9th in American Pop Idol or whatever that show is called. And it is Hudson, despite the effortless screen presences of Eddie Murphy and Jamie Foxx, and the incredible singing talents of Beyonce Knowles - who walks away with both the acting and singing accolades from Dreamgirls - picking up a handsome Oscar-nom in the process.Generally regarded as being inspired by the story of Diana Ross & The Supremes, Dreamgirls tells the tale of three girls who, after getting the gig of backup-singers to ageing, alcohol-friendly soul-singer Jimmy Early (Murphy, back on form), go through the trials and tribulations of becoming famous. The head of the trio is Effie White, a voluptuous and vocally bombastic singer who, after dating slimy producer Curtis Taylor Jr. (Foxx) is shafted as lead-singer in favour of the much more eye-friendly (but vocally bland) Deena Jones (Knowles). As the trio aim to become commercially successful without the aid of Early, Effie's bitterness towards both being shafted and her two-timing producer boyfriend, catches up with her. She finds herself out of the group, and out of a record deal, replaced with another thin, vocally-unremarkable singer, as the group continue their success without her.There is a moment in Dreamgirls where Curtis Taylor actually sits his wife Deena down and tells her that the reason he chose her to sing lead was because 'her voice has no personality'. Whilst all of us in the real world know this not to be the case, it is interesting that Dreamgirls addresses the issue of the blandification of black music in order to appeal to a broad audience. As Deena Jones, the star and headliner of the group, Beyonce Knowles delivers a mannered performance that, although clearly showing that she is not a great actress, is full of energy and conviction. Jennifer Hudson's performance, however, is what gives this film its edge. We all knew Beyonce could sing, but by god can Hudson belt out a number or two.With this film's typically accomplished technical achievements, it has a wonderfully colourful milieu, the cinematography capturing the mise-en-scene of the 60s and 70s wonderfully. Everything from the hairdos to the outfits, and the music itself fits the era it represents.If I have a criticism of Dreamgirls - it is perhaps that, at the heart, this is still a musical - albeit not a great one. If you are familiar with the music of the Supremes, you may find the musical numbers in Bill Condon's film a little underwhelming, or even uninspiring. Eddie Murphy doesn't have the greatest voice in the world, but he performs his passable lyrics with enough verve to get you in the mood for all his wiggling - but none of the songs are well written, nor will they stay with you like Caberet (1972) or Evita (1995). Part-attack on the commercialisation of heartfelt soul-singing, Dreamgirls for the most part remains a fun, technically accomplished, lavish musical with enough soul to prevent you from getting the blues.",6,1,2,5 February 2007
Jarhead," Bullets, bullets everywhere, but not a shot to shoot
","JARHEAD (15) DIR: SAM MENDESIn case anybody was unsure, war is apparently hell. Just ask Captain Benjamin Willard in Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now (1979). Or Private Chris Taylor in Oliver Stone's Platoon (1986). Not to mention Private Ryan. Hell even Forrest Gump told us that (But you ain't got no legs... etc etc). So why do we need to learn this again? Going into Jarhead, all that was on my mind was that it was the new film from the director of American Beauty, starring the man from Brokeback Mountain (which I loved). So even if I already knew that war was indeed hell, I might as well hear their side of it, not being familiar with Anthony Swofford's novel.The film starts out showing the various dehumanising techniques that the grunts go through. Incredibly nasty drill instructors sapping any spirit that these young pretenders may have had, the main character then doubting his decision to join the marines, and of course, lots of boisterous marines behaving impetuously. Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his friend Troy (Peter Sarsgaard) are training to become snipers. To them it's great. A chance to finally see some action. Instead of being behind a desk doing mindless office work. But once the war starts, the action seems to have taken a vacation. And that's what Jarhead is all about. The banality of modern war, and the obsolete soldier who is sent to fight it.The motif of Jarhead is pretty similar to the war films that we have already been enduring ever since the end of Vietnam. There was nothing in the opening twenty minutes that I hadn't seen in Stanley Kubrick's overlooked Full Metal Jacket (1989). At the beginning of the film the protagonist is somewhat reserved. An apprehensive intellect who reads Camus and is doing his duty in light of his father, who served in Vietnam. As the film goes on, he is eventually one of the boys, and to some degree is in fact a leader to the boys, which made me think of Platoon (1986). Even David O. Russel's superior Three Kings (1999) covers a lot of themes being discussed by Sam Mendes. The cast are all very good. Jake Gyllenhaal now has the tag of the intellectual leading man. Jamie Foxx is hitting so many high points at this point in his career it's hard to believe he used to do Saturday Night Live. But the film's biggest strengths lie in it's cinematography and it's black humour. There is one scene in which the soldiers sit down and watch Apocalypse Now with sadistic and ironic glee. These are men who want to fight, but don't need to. And as such, end up driving each other mad. The modern soldier is not one who is pelted with bullets and fights his way through the mud. As the protagonist says in his voice-over 'There is no solution for mental unbalance'. It is not anti-war, nor is it pro-war. It is merely questioning the position of the modern soldier. He is taught the love his rifle, and to be prepared ALWAYS. But for what? Where is the danger? And in the heat of the desert, with his fingers itching over the tempestuous trigger, what is he to do? There is one scene later in the film where a Vietnam war veteran jumps on one of the parading trucks with all the marines. He tearfully embraces the soldiers, and congratulates them on winning. It is perhaps the darkest, and yet funniest moment in the film. Vietnam was a both a mental and physical hell. Kuwait was a mental and physical bore fest. And whilst a film about boredom never looks good on paper, Sam Mendes has done enough to make it both engaging and insightful, even it is reminiscent of superior work gone by.",7,0,1,16 January 2006
No Country for Old Men," Outstanding work from the Coen Brothers
","No Country For Old Men's opening prologue, spoken carefully and wistfully by Tommy Lee Jones' weary sheriff, tells the story of him having to put a 14-year-old killer in the electric chair. He killed his girlfriend, not because he had a motive, but to see what it would feel like. This opening speech sets up No Country For Old Men, the new release from Coen Brothers - Joel and Ethan, which then goes on to explore that baseless type of evil in the form of Javier Bardem's ruthless, mop-topped killer. He plays Anton Chigurh (how you pronounce his last name is dependant on who says it), a stone-faced killer trying to track down a missing bag of drug money, after a deal goes horribly wrong in the Texan desert. Josh Brolin's local simpleton Llewellyn Moss is the man who took the money after stumbling across the aftermath of the deal-gone-wrong. Everything seems to go remarkably well for Moss until he makes one fatal mistake, leading Chigurh onto his tail. Tommy Lee Jones' sheriff Ed Tom Bell attempts to find Moss before Chigurh does.Apart from being an amazingly tense, and brilliantly shot straightforward genre movie, No Country For Old Men is also a faithfully adapted story that encompasses all the philosophical debates present in Cormack McCarthy's novel. Ed Tom Bell, the beleaguered sheriff weary with the modern world is wondering where the hell society is leading itself. He is convinced, at his mature age, that the world is going to hell in a hand basket, and morality is being sapped from society. But is that really the case, or has the world always been an evil and dark place? The Coens, like McCarthy, clearly think so, despite themselves being at an age when conservative nostalgia evokes a form of pride when you could remember the 'good old days' of yesteryear. Days when, in your own interpretation, people were nicer and less evil to each other. Anton Chigurh embodies the new kind of evil that people like Bell are forced to face. And Moss is simply the small time player who thinks he can play along with the big guns.The performances are roundly fantastic, but no one draws the audiences' attention quite like Javier Bardem. The Spanish superstar dares the camera to look at him with his almost lifeless eyes, and the cattle gun he uses to mercilessly kill his targets. Undoubtedly, however, the real star of the movie are the Coens themselves. Along with famed cinematographer Roger Deakins, Joel and Ethan have made their best movie in years. After dabbling in fairly flimsy-but-throwaway material like The Ladykillers and Intolerable Cruelty, this sees them back on the form of edgier films like Fargo and Blood Simple. Even though many found themselves at sea with the head-scratching ending, there is no denying that as a piece of genre cinema, this is top quality stuff. As a poetic meditation on the new evils of the world, it is even better.",9,3,8,16 February 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," An epic masterpiece. Thoughtful, philosophical and profoundly existential
","With a title almost as long as the 160-movie it names, regular movie-goers might be forgiven for thinking that The Assassination of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford is worth a miss. Too, even, that a title basically giving away the central hub of the film's plot makes it hard for studio execs to sell the film as a sassy, gun-toting western with shlocky shoot-em-ups and angel eyes Brad Pitt darling it up in the lead role. This was all many were expecting after several re-edits, one being a but-numbing 3¬Ω hour cut, were made to a film that actually wrapped up filming in 2005. But what Chopper director Andrew Dominik has delivered, in only his second film, is an beautiful, epic, meditative poem of a western, that once again transforms the genre, once such a stable for conservative normality, by dissecting the myths that created it.Brad Pitt is uber-outlaw Jesse James, co-founder of the James-Younger gang, primarily specialising in train robberies. Casey Affleck is Robert Ford, a clumsy, awkward upstart, who is entranced by Jesse James to the point of obsession. He views him like a celebrity, studying his life, his robberies, his voice and even his mannerisms. He is so entranced that at one point whilst attempting to engage his idol in a conversation during one of James' tin bath sessions, James very coldly utters to Ford 'Do you want to be like me? Or do you wanna be me?'.Ford is constantly teased by his fellow thieves and gunmen, taunted for his love and idolisation of the gang ringleader. As the title suggests (or rather gives away), it leads to a tragic conclusion, a conclusion revealed so that the whole film may operate on a level far more complex than mere formulaic convention. Since we know the fate of the hero, it is not about where the journey ends, or indeed how it ends. But rather what the journey is, and how the characters deal with it. James seems to flirt with the idea of death, having been rendered a stalinesque paranoia-case after losing faith in all of his gang members. Towards the end of the film, he relies only on the help of the Ford brothers Charlie and Robert, not being able to trust any one else. He would be proved right, when Robert is the one to pull the trigger.The Assassination of Jesse James is a majestic western. It is beautifully shot in a way that doesn't just please the eye, but utterly renders both the icy mood and bitterly cold temperature of the film it colours. The acting is first rate, with Brad Pitt playing the cold psychopath that is Jesse James with a subtle viciousness beneath his icy blue eyes. But Casey Affleck is the man who walks away with the film. Every scene he is in, he steals. His Robert Ford is brilliantly balanced between the enthusiastically enthralled and gawkish pathos. His obsession with James is understandable, given the legend of the outlaw that has spun a million myths in its wake, but it is reminiscent, at least to a modern audience, of a Mark Chapman ¬ñ the man who shot John Lennon. In fact one of the many themes running throughout Andrew Dominik's film is that of the obsession with a myth. He is known as the 'coward' but is it to be a coward? Ford idolises James like many people do modern celebrities. When James reveals his spiteful and altogether psychotic edge to Ford, the myth is dispelled, and everything Ford had invested in him becomes crushed. All Ford could do to redeem himself, he felt, would be to kill James, and end the charade. But alas, all that did was strengthen the legend further.Perhaps in another world, it would be pleasant to know that The Assassination of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford gets all the credit it deserves, but it appears to have split many people up the middle. Some people think it is pretentious, and write sniffy articles about the film's languidness. Others think it is too long and obscure. I am at the point now when it really doesn't matter when dealing with a film of this magnitude, because it was a profoundly affecting experience, one reminiscent of the beautiful epics Terrence Malick used to make. If you find a better film this year, I would very surprised.",9,15,27,14 December 2007
Cars," Yeeeeeeoooowmm!!!
","After the eco-friendly murmurisms of Over The Hedge, the genius behind Toy Story offers up a fable about a world dominated by cars. Those noisy little things that, along with TV and fast food, stopped everyone from walking. The visuals are fab, the jokes somewhat drab but the racing is top notch pixar. Even when they aren't quite on form, it is hard to fault what they do best.Owen Wilson voices Lightning McQueen, a hot shot race car who, after drawing with two other cars in the final of the Piston Cup, is the favourite to win, a first for a rookie. On his way to the playoff race in California, his way of carriage decides to take a nap whilst trotting along the intersection. As a result, McQueen ends up in the charmingly barmy town of Radiator Springs, the kind of place you'd want to visit, but wouldn't like to live in. His holier-than-thou ways don't exactly impress the simple townsfolk, not least Doc Hudson (Newman), the wise old granddad of the town. He learns those familiar lessons of 'There's more to life than racing' and yaddy yada. And it is all perfectly charming and fairly amusing whilst never being particularly effecting.Except, of course, for it's visuals. Cars is gorgeous, every pixel is beautifully rendered, so we have superb backdrops of waterfalls, the glow of traffic lights and rim lamps in the night, and of course rust. Lots of rust and dirt. Then there's the racing: the nascar-style drives are electric for both kids and adults. So in the end, whilst it has a decent, if predictable cast of characters, it is the aesthetics that win you over. Whilst Cars is probably lacking that great wit of The Incredibles, or indeed the benchmark film Toy Story, but it isn't disappointing. It doesn't necessarily go nought to sixty in 3 seconds, but manages to keep a relatively enjoyable pace for it's overlong duration.",7,6,9,28 August 2006
Ghost Rider," Bland, stupid and thoroughly rubbish
","I personally have no problem with vacuous throwaway entertainment, particularly movies that exist for no other reason than to allow your brain to disengage itself for at least 90 minutes of rip-roaring stupidity. Whether it is the joy of seeing Ace Ventura talk out of his ass or Sylvester Claude-Van Schwatzenegger shoot the hell out of anything that moves, as long as the movie delivers a maintainable level of perfunctory nothingness, my tolerance of its glaring lack of merit can be incredibly high. Comic-book adaptations are an interesting case however. Films like Sam Raimi's Spider-Man, or Brian Singer's X-Men series do genuinely have souls, not least emotional depth and resonance. I have not read the comic books of Ghost Rider, so I cannot tell you whether there was any sense of depth intended behind the surface of Marvel's daredevil fantasy. But since there isn't any in the film, one could only hope for a salvation of blistering action.Our story begins with a young pre-ghost riding Johnnie Blanze, a hot-shot daredevil who performs death-defying stunts with his famous father. One day, stumbling across a screwed-up letter in a waste bin, he finds out that his dad is suffering from cancer, and can feel death knocking at his door. Blaze is then confronted by Peter Fonda (played by the devil), who offers to cure his father's cancer in return for young Blaze's soul. Blaze agrees, but it is not enough to save his father from death. Now under the commandment of Mephistopheles, Blaze continues his career as a world famous daredevil, but at night becomes the 'Ghost Rider'.Nicholas Cage appears to know how silly this project is, and his over-reaching extremities do occasionally make the odd cameo appearance every time something physical happens to him. But even he seems relatively bored with himself throughout most of the film. We get the wide eyes, the maniacal smile, the floating arms, but what we don't get is a truly engaging hero. There is absolutely nothing remotely interesting about his relationship with Eva Mendes, and despite the death of his father, he doesn't appear to be terribly bummed out about it. Half way through the film, Sam Elliot turns up as a manly grave-digger who chops wood and says things like 'A man who sells his soul for love has the power to change the world.' in an incredibly gravely voice. Considering just how bland Peter Fonda makes the devil seem, it is only Elliot who livens up any scene he's in. But it is not enough to save this film.The action and CGI is disappointing, particularly when Blaze actually turns into Ghost Rider. Making a fiery demon say things like 'You're going down!' or 'Hey dirtbag! You're starting to p*ss me off!' doesn't exactly send shivers down my spine, nor does it have any of the Gothic resonance of the Batman movies. Instead what we have is an incredibly stupid, utterly bland film that is so aware of its target audience that no sane person over the age of 14 could actually take it seriously. Hell the actors don't, so why should you?",4,0,2,11 March 2007
The Lives of Others," Superb political drama. Compelling, intriguing and emotionally engaging.
","Here's a film that achieves that most difficult of things: balancing the weight of its politics with genuine emotional engagement. The Lives Of Others never feels like a history lecture or political diatribe. We care for the characters first, and discuss the socio-political commentary post-viewing. Set amid the latter years of Communist East Germany, The Lives Of Others concerns playwright Georg Dreyman (Koch), a playwright who has attracted the irk of the Stasi, East Germany's main intelligence force. The grotesquely corrupt minister of culture (Thieme) places him and his actress-wife under secret surveillance for the GDR. The man sent to spy on the couple is lonely stasi officer Hauptmann Wiesler (M√ºhe). Pale-faced and relatively unassuming to look at, Wiesler always keeps his dullish grey jacket zipped up, his face never revealing more than a whisker of emotion, other than to the camera in moments of intimacy. His voyeurism of this couple leads him to become morally conflicted. He discovers vital information about them and their plans, but begins to doubt whether reporting it would best serve his own interests. Meanwhile, tensions grow between Georg and his wife Christa, who has to solicit the vile culture minister in order to remain immune from interrogation.The Lives Of Others is a fascinating movie. Without the need for high-speed chases, a zillion edits or an exploding helicopter shot, it remains a thoroughly engaging, insightful and compelling experience. Ulrich M√ºhe delivers a remarkably underplayed performance as the stasi guard with a conscience, reminiscent of Gene Hackman's low-key surveillance freak Harry Caul in The Conversation (1974). He has steely-blue eyes that fool his companions into thinking he's bulletproof, but the truth couldn't be further from their grasp. You will come out of the screening with many issues to discuss, not least the film's insightful take on the high rate of suicide in 1980s East Germany, and it's relatively compassionate feel for its characters. Some may complain about portraying a stasi officer in such a compassionate light, but it works beautifully within the context of the tale. It may not break into the mainstream, but it is a fantastic debut feature.",8,0,1,5 May 2007
Transformers," Overblown silliness
","After buying his first car, gawky high-school nerd Sam (Shia Leboef) learns he has actually stumbled across Bumblebee, one of the transforming 'autobots' from planet cybertron. He is there to warn off an impending attack from the decepticons, an evil brand of transformer, who are hell-bent on launching an all-out invasion. Together he teams up with high school sex-goddess, borderline lap dancer, Mikaela (played by Megan Fox who looks a lot older than most high school girls). The original series of Transformers was nothing special, but admittedly had charm. Michael Bay's latest crime against cinema takes that charm, and turns it into a great big two hour advert for a mobile phone. Every girl who shows up just happens to look like Paris Hilton, and you could probably fill a beach with the amount of gruff dirt and manly sweat dripping from the eyebrows of our beloved human heroes. Even the action is underwhelming, devoid of menace or subtlety to underplay the visual vasectomy that your eyes will suffer from. The only redeeming quality is Shia Leboef, who is so charmingly funny amid the preposterousness of the actual Transformers, almost validating the movie's ballooned sense of silliness.",5,3,7,23 December 2007
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Great night and good luck
","How apt that after his wonderful debut 'Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind' proved an unjustly non-performer at the box office, that George Clooney comes up trumps with this fantastic monochrome, political thriller. It's a terrific piece of work, and makes me yearn for even more of Gorgeous George's direction.Edward R. Murrow is credited with triggering the downfall of the vehemently anti-communist former US senator Joseph McCarthy. This being a period piece it has awoken many historians to debate this fact. Regardless of the solid truth, he certainly got under McCarthy's skin, forcing him to go on television and justify his actions. It's debatable whether Murrow was the archetype behind opposing senator McCarthy's communist witch-hunts, but to be perfectly honest this movie was working so well it really wasn't on my mind. McCarthyism is obviously a big part of 'Good Night, And Good Luck', in the same way that race is a big part of Paul Haggis' 'Crash'. More importantly though, the central theme for me is to do with journalism, something Clooney learnt from his newsreader father. It has obviously rubbed off on him - the sets and atmosphere in 'Good Night, And Good Luck' really do encapsulate the grubby claustrophobia and retro 50s nostalgia of old newsrooms and bulletins. Murrow's producer Fred Friendly had terrible difficulty with both the government and his own boss William Paley.Back in a time when news was thought to be thoroughly unbiased and factual, the film is bookended by Murrow delivering a rather opprobrious speech at a banquet about how television broadcasting is going to hell on account of censorship and bias. Murrow, Friendly et al certainly opposed McCarthy's methods, but defended their stance by delivering what they believed were facts, rather than 'rumour, hearsay and innuendo'. It's a pertinent thought, and one that seems lost in today's increasingly biased media. Or as Murrow so integrally put it 'power's cheerleader'. He said this in 1958. Ironic perhaps, that it is so relevant to the current administration.The cast are all great. Robert Downey Jr. reins it in for his performance as Joe Wersheba, a man secretly married to another CBS employee, disallowed at the time. His relationship with Shirley (Patricia Clarkson) provides the film with a illustrative sub-plot of how McCarthyism works. George Clooney as Fred Friendly is the yin to Ed Murrow's yang. He kicks where Murrow stares and bites when Murrow chews. The undeniable star however is David Strathairn. He is marvellously subtle, saying more with glances and cigarettes than he does with words. He 'll probably get ousted in the Oscars race by the flashier performances, but I'd love to see him coveted for his work. I haven't seen him in much. He said he'd been waiting 25 years for this call. I look forward to seeing him in the future.The decision to use newsreel footage of McCarthy instead of an actor was, on paper, a potential recipe for disaster. Not only does it work, it provides the film with some of it's most powerful scenes. People can see this man for what he was, rather than how someone would have him.It also gives the movie an almost documentary feel. One scene in particular is comprised only of showing the trial of Annie Lee Moss. Scenes involving the news team debating were reminiscent of Robert Altman films, where actors would improvise and overlap one another. Technically the film is magnificent. The monochrome colouring gives the film an aura of acute dignity. A smart decision by Clooney, he's taken some obvious risks with 'Good Night, And Good Luck' and in my opinion have paid off wonderfully. It does, on occasion, look like everyone's smoking too much. But they did anyway. As far as the Oscars go, I'm now tied with this and Brokeback Mountain, which is obviously the weightier of the two films. But this is a real gem. Even if you know nothing about politics or journalism. George? Job's a good'n.",8,1,2,20 February 2006
Mulholland Drive," Mind-Bendingly Brilliant
","Whatever one might make of the mysterious meanings behind David Lynch's enigmatic neo-noir, one thing is almost inarguable about Mulholland Drive: Every second of it is perfectly rendered into a beautifully spooky Rubik's cube of a movie. At the heart of it's narrative lies a young woman apparently named Bettie. She has travelled from Cananda to pursue a fairy-tale like career as a movie star in Hollywood. Upon her trails she encounters a dark haired woman who, after suffering a car crash, has a case of amnesia. Agreeing to help the woman regain her true consciousness, the movie then proceeds to unravel a simmeringly dark tale of reality and unreality, within the realms of movie stardom. Or perhaps not. Since Lynch remains tight-lipped about the movie's true interpretation (if there really is one) even if you find yourself completely bewildered by the mind-bending narrative, don't let that get in the way of your sheer enjoyment of this feature. It is mesmerising stuff.",9,4,7,24 November 2006
Dumb and Dumber," One of the funniest films of the 1990s
","Well it may not be Fellini, but it certainly takes an iron stomach not laugh at arguably, The Farrelly brothers most rib-tickling movie to date. Jim Carrey does his stuff like only he knows how, but it is Dumb, rather than Dumber, who takes the biggest plaudits. Jeff Daniels makes mince meat out of some of the scripts best lines ('She fed me some crap about not listening to her, I dunno, I wasn't really paying attention'). There are wonderful site gags (checkout Lloyd's plunge onto the airport floor) and magnificently delivered lines. Some of the material doesn't leave much in the way of subtlety (one moment involving a toilet and a laxative), but as crude humour goes, it's hard to fault. And unlike so many comedies before it, D & D manages to stay true to its material until the very end, eschewing soppy feel goods for dumb, and then some. I haven't laughed this much since I saw The Quest For The Holy Grail, and I do not say that lightly.",7,1,2,7 April 2006
Blood Diamond," Whilst the shoot-outs and car chases will refrain your butt from numbing, the political issues will have you stroking your chin all the same.
","If diamonds really are a girl's best friend, they must be an African's worst nightmare, as Blood Diamond uncovers the filthy truth behind the murky trade business of conflict diamonds. Ed Zwick's new film is an issue movie, dressed up as a rip-roaring action-thriller (or an issuetainment film to all you Sun readers). The issue of conflict diamonds is raised right at the start, as a table full of UN 'peacekeepers' discusses the problems with how our sparkly necklaces may have, at one time or another, been drenched in crimson at the hands of smugglers.Our story centres on the family of Soloman Vandy (Honsou), a fisherman from Mende whose village is ravished by an armed mob of diamond smugglers, sealing Vandy into slavery, and kidnapping his son. A South African smuggler by the name of Danny (DiCaprio) is thrown in prison for smuggling, and it is here that he meets Vandy. Learning of Soloman's catch of a massive diamond, he uses him in order to make the sale of a lifetime. Unfortunately, his quest to locate the stone is complicated through both Vandy's son being brainwashed by the RUF mercenaries, and a journalist by the name of Maddy Bowen (Connolly), who they need to take them to the site of the diamond mines.Despite coming under some criticism for his (actually quite good) African accent, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a refreshingly evil performance as the cold-hearted diamond smuggler Danny Archer. But it is Djimon Honsou, as the man desperate to find his family, and escape the wrath of the RUF, who has the stand out performance. Vandy goes through a whole checklist of emotions, each resonating with the audience with true conviction and power. You can almost taste the sweat and smell the fear from his mannerisms. But perhaps the star of the show is the director, who specialises in making entertaining pictures out of political issues. Blood Diamond strikes a worthy balance between the thrills and the chin-stroking.",7,1,2,27 February 2007
Inside Man," Lee goes mainstream and succeeds
","Spike Lee's most mainstream movie to date starts off as a standard popcorn heist movie, then turns into a character study whilst throwing some nice twists for good measure. It works most of the time, managing to squeeze in a couple of post-9/11 political points, but by and large this is much lighter on the racial Leeisms of films gone by, instead offering us a superior genre movie stop gap so that Lee can now go off and do the serious stuff he yearns to.The cast is one of those ultra-reliable 'do this in their sleep' line ups featuring the wonder that is Denzil Washington doing his thing as the hostage negotiator sent to try and solve this situation, Clive Owen, whose American accent is still taking it's final exams, is otherwise having the time of his life as the criminal mastermind hoping to score the bank out of all that it's worth and there is fantastic support from Jodie Foster, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Willem Defoe and Christopher Plummer.Half way through inside man the film skips to post-heist scenes of various hostages being interviewed about what they do or don't know. This then sets in motion an intriguing tale of what actually takes place during the heist. It appears as though the robbery may be far more complex than first thought by Detective Keith Frazier. The bank's owner appears to have his own dark secrets that may be dug up by the robbers, and sends Ms Fix-It (Foster) to negotiate it further. We are also shown the nasty side to the supposed good guys; Lee adopts a post-9/11 attitude, dealing with racial stereotypes of Asian New Yorkers. One such unlucky fellow is thought to be an Arabic terrorist when he emerges from the bank as a freed hostage, only to tell everyone that he's actually a Sikh.The main problem with Inside Man is that as it goes on, the plot holes become more evident. By the final third it seems as though the story has been wrapped up, yet we are still here. At 129 minutes it outstays it's welcome, but for all its faults it is still a darn good, very tense thriller, with a knockout cast and New York maestro director.",7,1,1,30 March 2006
Pulp Fiction," Revolutionary 1990s cool
","Watching Pulp Fiction for the first time is like discovering a new type of music that'll soon be sweeping every wannabe-cool DJ's airwaves. Watching it for a second time makes you realise just how formulaic and mundane all those seminars and handbooks about 'How to write a Hollywood script' really are. I don't want to criticise the Robert McKee class of Scriptwriting, we all know that we need the occasional 'Mission: Impossible' to tickle our funny bone rather than our minds, but you don't have to be a genius, or indeed a scriptwriter, to work out that Pulp Fiction really is a true work of art. A film that, despite all it's obvious inspirations, was such an original film, not least one of the most important of the 1990s, spawning all kinds of replicas, inspirations and wannabe filmmakers. The celebration of junk food, bad hair and kitsch cool could never be told with as much fizz or energy as in Tarantino's second coming.In the film's opening we meet Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer, deliberating in a diner about how no one ever sticks-up restaurants. 'Bars, liquor stores, you'll get your head blown off stickin' up one of them!' Roth says, in his south London twang. He has a point too. They decide to rob the place they're in. If only they knew of the consequences. In fact, if only ALL the characters knew what they were doing. Pulp Fiction is an endless show of people f'ing things up. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson play a pair of 70s-hyperbole laden hit men. A similar set up to the previous scene has our protagonists talking about nothing in particular - burgers, pot, what they put on fries in Paris - then launching into a violent tirade among their now pursued yuppie friends, who obviously owe money to the two hit men's boss. It is a shocking switch of tone, one that works seamlessly, and sums up how well Tarantino and Avary can write. It also shows how violence is simply a way of life for these men. And with all this in mind, authenticity is still right at the back of your mind; Pulp Fiction is a movie about old movies, not real life. Everything from the blazing soundtrack to Jackson's hideously groovy afro to the incredibly simple story lines - a boxer throws a fight, but must get his father's watch back before the gangsters find it, a body must be dumped before the wife gets home, a woman OD's and must be resuscitated before the her husband (the boss) finds out - is a one huge jollification of everything trashy but cool.And what of the now infamous cast that Tarantino so delicately hired to work his script? John Travolta has had so many revivals in his fluctuating career, but this role showed us such a new spin on the Travolta ball. He is great as the stoner hit-man, who gets himself in deep waters with the boss' woman, played by an equally impressive Uma Thurman, who nails the moll wife exquisitely - complete with 20s style hair and an irresistible underlying seduction. We all know what Bruce Willis is capable of when he puts his acting chops to the test, and able assistance is given by the likes Harvey Keitel, Christopher Walken (in one the movies' funniest scenes) and Tim Roth. But it is Samuel L. Jackson who walks away as the new star in Hollywood. With His explosive and dynamic turn as the fast talking, god-fearing partner-in-crime of Vincent Vega, Jules, he delivers most of the movie's many memorable lines, and epitomises the effortlessness of Tarantino cool: He is bold, funny, explicit and explosive. His lack of Oscar at that years' ceremony should have been filed under the human rights act.A comic book of comedy with enough one-liners to keep the QT devotees annoyingly quoting until it may just seem a bit too good to be true, Pulp Fiction, even now - with all the time we've had to wrap it up and endure it's obvious imitators - still seems fresh. A film like no other, despite it's obvious homages to Godard, film-noir and blaxploitation. It's pretty easy to dismiss his work as violent trash, but yet look at the recipients of all the bad deeds in the film: the ones who 'see the light' as it were are the ones who succeed, the ones who continue to fall foul to the bad ways of life are the ones who pay for it in the end (one such unlucky character ends up in a rather unenviable position between a redneck rapist and his gun toting partner). In the end, it is a very simple collection of stories about redemption, about people who get themselves in horrible, yet hilarious, situations and have to arduously dig themselves out. Its legacy is indisputable. Its value is priceless. You haven't seen anything until you see Pulp Fiction.",10,0,1,10 May 2006
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," Strictly for fans only. Tenacious D has little to convert the non-essentials to Jack Black's style of comedy.
","If you imagined a band half way between the vocal tirades of Meat Loaf and the relentless guitar playing of System Of a Down, you have a vague idea of what listening to Tenacious D is like. The best/worst rock band of all time finally get realised on the big screen in Liam Lynch's Tenacious D: The Pick Of Destiny. Here, we get a relatively dull back-story of how Tenacious D formed, and then a slightly more amusing tale of their voyage to find 'the pick of destiny'.Tenacious D comes alive with its music. Whether it is JB's fantasy about rocking an open mike lounge or the stand off between the D and the Devil, these are the liveliest moments in this disappointing spectacle. There are also a couple of amusing cameo appearances, the funniest comes from exec-producer Ben Stiller, who explains the back-story of the infamous pick with laugh-drenching detail. And Tim Robbins turns up as a knife-wielding madman hell-bent on snatching the pick from our two lame-brained heroes. But sadly √Ç‚Äì this movie rarely stretches beyond its own fan base. The film's director, Liam Lynch, who himself was responsible for the novelty record 'United States Of Whatever' does not seem to instill his film with the kind of quirky flair that made Nacho Libre (2006) offer a Jack Black that played it low-key. Nor, for that matter, does it possess the wit or charm of School Of Rock (2003), a film where we knew that Black was meant to be rubbish and slothful.Jack Black has never been one for subtle humour, but his uber-energetic schtick still needs the right direction in a film. In High Fidelity (1999) he was kept on a leash by playing opposite John Cusack, whose character brought a healthy balance to the script. Here he is let loose along with co-star Kyle Gass who, sadly, possesses none of the comic talents of his portly sidekick. The film relies far too much on the wide-eyed externalisms of JB to liven up the dull screenplay. But it is not Black's fault that this movie is ultimately under whelming. His previous film, Nacho Libre had a weird quirkiness to it. Not only that, but Black's character was meant to be ridiculed, whereas here it is never truly sure if Tenacious D are meant to be cool or rubbish. The world around our two protagonists is just as stupid as they are. Still, this should not disappoint the hardcore D faithful. It offers a satisfying experience, even if it doesn't live up to the Wayne's World's of this world.",6,0,1,9 December 2006
The Departed," Dynamic, Brutal Thriller
","Martin Scorsese swaps the mean streets of New York for the green streets of Boston in this electro-charged double-double agent crime thriller. At his disposal are his most starry cast ever, among them Leonardo DiCaprio as the hapless cop Billy Costigan forced into the violent underbelly of Boston's crime family. The yin to his yang is Matt Damon who's character, Colin Sullivan, develops mob ties as a lad, then honours those loyalties by becoming a trooper in the state police, giving Costello influence on the inside. As the story unfolds, Costigan and Sullivan become aware of the nature of each other, and must dig each other out before the other one does, or before getting found out. Among the supporting players are Martin Sheen as the stern but caring police chief Queenan, and Mark Wahlberg, who steals every scene his in as a foul-mouthed, though as nails cop working along side Queenan and Costigan against Costello.Whilst the movie is based on the outstanding Hong Kong thriller 'Infernal Affairs' The Departed is very much 'un film de Martin Scorsese'. Many of the basic plot strands in Wai Keung Lau and Siu Fai Mak's film are present in The Departed, such as the famous silent 30 second phone call, but very seldom do you get any feeling of d√©j√† vu. One such tweak is the role of the mob boss, a important but austere figure in the Hong Kong film, is transformed into a towering inferno in the form of Jack Nicholson's Frank Costello. Here he is the bulk of much of the film's power and emotion, guiding both our protagonists as they attempt to bring their factions down from the inside.Nicholson is almost unavoidably 'Jack' these days. Even when he is playing the psychotic, misogynistic, blood loving Irish mob boss Frank Costello, Nicholson instils him with his evil screen presence, effortlessly charming the audience as well as repulsing them. At times his scenery munching threatens to imbalance the gritty tone of the movie, but just as the seemingly inevitable arching of those infamous eyebrows begins to tease us, we are kept ashore by our faithful director. Not even 'Jack' can steal a Scorsese film.This is Martin Scorsese's first pure genre outing since his reworking of Cape Fear (1991). Whilst I wasn't a huge fan of that particular film, here he succeeds by not limiting himself by the material. Yes this is a genre movie, but that 1970s Scorsese potency perfumes itself throughout, through trademark snazzy editing, a barnstorming rock soundtrack and lots of gratuitous violence. The characters are multi-layered; Matt Damon's mafia ties are at one point complicated by his new found love life. Leonardo DiCaprio is honourable as a cop, but has enough violent tendencies, and drug dependence to throw his good guy image into a mist. The original film was all about entering a layer of hell of getting your real identity confused with your pretense. Whilst this film doesn't quite achieve the depth on top of the style that the original did, and nor does it compete with the heavyweight contenders of Scorsese's yesteryears, such as Mean Streets or Goodfellas, it is never-the-less one of the most electrifying movies I have seen this year. This is, in no small part, due to the wonderful cast, from the poster boys to the equally starry supporting players like Alec Baldwin as a crack police chief, and Ray Winstone who exuberates his nasty, gruff henchman persona with panache despite his Boston-Irish accent seemingly floating in and out of his native cockney at free will. This isn't quite vintage Scorsese, but with Scorsese being the genius he is, its still a dandy.",8,0,0,17 October 2006
Wedding Crashers," Trite yet still amusing comedy
","The Wedding Crashers is a film that advertises two childish bozos crashing weddings and bagging hotties. It looks like a lot of fun. It's a shame it never quite lived up to that hype.For 25 minutes the Wedding Crashers is just that. Two guys crashing weddings with preposterous, yet altogether amusing back stories about who they are, and why they are there. Fine. Then at one wedding John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) meets a girl named Claire. And after he meets her boyfriend, he knows that he must somehow woo her out of his arms, much to the chagrin of Jeremy (Vince Vaughn).The characters grow consciences. Consciences? Why? I have no problem with sentiment in film. I loved Jerry Maguire and When Harry Met Sally. But if in American Pie Stifler turned around and said 'Actually this bozo clowning isn't for me, I'm going to get married and settle down instead' you would be scoffing at the screen.The rest of the film then plays out somewhat loosely like Meet The Parents, in which both men try to impress their ladies' father. Que stock characters galore; we meet the nasty boyfriend, the Grandma who says whatever's on her mind, the good hearted waiter and the gay son. And there are some hit and miss jokes along the way too (The funniest being at the dinner table).Did I laugh? Yes. Was I glad I saw it? Well, yes. So no it's not a bad film. But I can't help but feel that I didn't watch the Wedding Crashers. I watched a much more schmaltzy and diluted film (the ending would make Frank Capra roll his eyes). But it IS funny. So I'm giving this one a marginal thumbs up, on the strength of it's jokes. Just a shame about the rest though.",6,2,5,14 January 2006
There Will Be Blood," Mesmerising saga
","Paul Thomas Anderson's mesmerising oil saga about a gold digger who strikes oil around the turn of the 20th century enraptured audiences as much as it disoriented them. The critics were wowed mostly by the majestic acting talents of Daniel-Day Lewis, who plays the titular anti-hero, a man slowly dissenting into a purgatory netherworld of moral and social bankruptcy. But it is far from just his film, or indeed Anderson's. The brooding score by Johnny Greenwood is mournfully unnerving, and the cinematography creates a vision of both a man and his hellish world that would give any monster movie a run for its money. It is difficult to comprehend the profoundly enigmatic aura of the film, without repeating the sound bites of a thousand other cineasts. you know what you have just witnessed is some kind of masterpiece, but you can't explain why.",8,2,5,16 April 2008
Downfall," Riveting
","Downfall is a fascinating movie, illustrating the fall of Nazi Germany and managing to stray away from simple dehumanisation. Featuring a frighteningly dead-on performance from Bruno Ganz as Adolp Hitler, Oliver Hirschbiegel's film never sympathises with it's characters, but rather complicates them, showing the depths behind evil and hatred. Shocking at best, compelling at worst, Downfall is one of the best realisations of Nazi Germany's fall ever made.Bookended with the last interview conducted by Hitler's real secretary (Traudl Junge), the film starts in 1942 with Adolph Hitler looking to recruit someone to type his letters and memoirs. He chooses Traudl (played by Alexandra Maria Lara) who is ecstatic to work with the Fuhrer. The film then cuts to 1945 inside Hitler's bunker, where it shall remain for most of the movie. Whilst Hitler is clearly the movie's selling point, it is largely told from Traudl Junge's point of view, being partly based on her autobiography - Bis zur letzten Stunde. We are presented with rational portrayals of those behind and around the Nazi regime - most notable are of Ernst-G√ºnter Schenck (Christian Berkel) as a caring doctor and Albert Speer (Heino Ferch) who, despite his heavy involvement with National Socialism, is seen here as more humanitarian, pleading with Hitler to think of the German people.In order to deal with the cruelty of humanity we must first accept that it is humans - not monsters or animals - that are responsible for it's shortcomings. It is far too convenient for anyone to look at the world's most evil men - in this case Adolph Hitler - and segregate them from our perception of humanity, in order to make sense of their actions. Downfall presents to us a view of the Nazis not as sympathetic characters, but rather highly complex ones. As as protagonist, Bruno Ganz' Hitler is an engaging character, with many depths. He is too proud to surrender or retreat from the Allies -even after all hope appears to be lost he still strives to fight the invading Red armies. It's clear that he is close to losing his mind, and even condemns his generals as traitors, when the most apparently rational thing to do is withdraw his armies from attacking the incoming Russians. Hitler is rightly shown up as the abhorrent despot he clearly was, but rather than shouting and bleating his way through 155 minutes, Bruno Ganz depicts a man who has compassion behind the madness. His relationships with Albert Speer and Traudl Junge show us the gentler side of the monster, as he is almost like a father figure to them.The movie doesn't necessarily solve any unanswered questions, but does leave the viewer pondering it afterwards. As a historical document it works well, but as a a piece of compelling cinema it works even better - finding heart where many wouldn't dare to look, actually moving it's audience as well as engaging them. Hirshbiegel dissects all sides of the human condition. Magda Goebbel's final acts are particularly shocking, balancing the movie's heart with it's dirt. It's not always easy to watch, but it is pretty compelling stuff. If only to see for Ganz's turn, Downfall is something you should not miss.",8,1,3,6 March 2006
The Last King of Scotland," Funny yet equally horrific
","Part-biopic, part-docudrama, but mostly supercharged thriller, The Last King Of Scotland tells the complex tale of a cocky young doctor Nicholas Garrigan (played by James McAvoy) who comes to Uganda by pure chance in the seventies, only to find himself as the personal assistant of one Idi Amin, the flamboyant dictator-cum-president of the newly independent nation. Just as Amin is won over by the frankness and sense of humour of the young doctor, Garrigan finds himself enchanted by the boisterous charm of his new patient. Amin (electrically played by Forest Whitaker) exhibits a charismatic wit that makes it easy for the audience to understand how he brainwashed so many people. The final act, however, delves deep into the monster that he would inevitably be remembered for ¬ñ the man who slaughtered 300 thousand of his people, and lived a paranoid reign for most of his time in power. The Last King Of Scotland, despite occasionally hitting a damp note, strikes a worthy balance between the comic and the horrific ¬ñ thanks largely to the Oscar worthy energy that Whitaker, a truly great and underrated actor, instills his performance with. A blistering thriller with an unusual mixture of haunting imagery and dark comedy, this is one of the early must-see films of the year.",8,3,4,28 January 2007
American Gangster," Excellent crime saga
","Ridley Scott's best film since Gladiator tells the true-life tale of Frank Lucas, a delegate of the Harlem crime scene who rises to become the biggest importer of the heroine drug in American history. Played brilliantly by Denzel Washington, Lucas is an ambiguous character, one who justifies his heinous business through everlasting love and devotion to his huge family, notably his mother. The film also explores the story of the cop who rigorously fought to bring him down - Ritchie Roberts, an equally impressive performance from Rusell Crowe. Eschewing his typical manly marauding screen presence, Crowe's Roberts is shlubby, awkward and difficult with his corrupt co-workers. The film is both reminiscent and directly referential of the great 70s cop thrillers that inspired it, such as The French Connection and Serpico. Although it never aspires to be on the same level as those films, it does make for a ripping and insightful crime saga.",7,0,2,23 December 2007
The Queen," Elevated by two heavyweight performances
","It may be called The Queen but Stephen Frears' Oscar-buzzing film is every bit as much about Tony Blair as it is her majesty. Covering the week in September before and after Diana's death, the film focuses on two perspectives, one being the newly appointed Prime Minister, whose popularity soars after proclaiming Diana as 'the people's princess', and that of the Royals, in particular the Queen's decision not to make a public statement about Diana, since she was no longer a member of their family. The Queen is about the battle between stoic traditionalism and modernity (with the two central figures representing the clash of both philosophies). And whilst the film itself is nothing truly remarkable, the weight gathered by the superb central performances of Helen Mirren and Michael Sheen elevate it beyond an ITV-style movie special. What is really baffling however, is that the Queen apparently enjoyed this allegedly anti-monarchist fable.",7,1,1,27 February 2007
Ben-Hur," Epic epic of epic proportions
","The rise of the telly box in the 1950s gave way to a new kind of Hollywood epic, one that producers thought would offer a completely different niche to the television experience. It was a kind of film that would see everything overblown to the max, making the most of the cinematic experience - sometimes too much. Ben Hur is the epitome of this new wave, featuring a near 4 hour running time, huge sweeping cinematography, epic battles, triumphs and a little bit here or there about a certain Jesus Christ. At it's best Ben Hur is a searing, fantastically realised epic, that with sheer ambition alone, will leave the viewer overwhelmed. At it's worst it is an overblown, over-ambitious epic that will leave the viewer overwhelmed. You get the point. Feauring a fittingly grandiose central performance from Charlton Heston, wonderful cinematography and a chariot race every bit as thrilling now as it was in 1959.Taglined as 'A tale of Christ' our film is set in 1st century Jerusalem. Our protagonist, Judah Ben Hur, is a rich, noble Jewish Prince. His childhood friend is now a commander in the Roman legions, but has come to visit his long-time friend. They reminisce, at first, seeming like the old friends they always were. Yet Messala's true ambition is one that angers the righteously stubborn Ben Hur, after he learns of Messala's want of Judah to be an informant of the Romans. 'You are either with us, or against us' Messala tempestuously informs his old friend. As the friendship quickly turns to nemesis, the film then follows our protagonist as he goes from Prince, to slave, to Roman, back to Prince again in truly sweeping style. His encounters Jesus Christ evoke Christian imagery and feeling to the story, as our Jewish friend is saved by him.Ben Hur had Oscar written all over it, both before that year's nominations and during it. The sheer weight of its story is enough to garner acclaim for years to come. At a three and a half hour running time it may drag on for a lot of people, yet just as your bum is about to go, the chariot race will have you screaming for more. At times it is ponderous, and even overambitious. But as far as spectacle goes, this is the grand daddy of them all. A classic in its own right, and a film that saved MGM from bankruptcy.",10,2,5,27 May 2006
Casino Royale," Big and stupid - but with ATTITUDE. The best bond in absolute ages.
","The bond franchise returns with a tougher, darker and blonder hero in the form of Daniel Craig. When asked if wants his dry Martini 'shaken or stirred?' he replies 'Do I look like I give a damn?' It is nice to know that even when the franchise has got to the point of being self-referential, even those little remarks are typical Bond quips. Casino Royale shows 007 right at the very beginning of his MI6 tenure, even before he has achieved '00' status. A crooked banker by the name of Le Chiffre (Mikkelson) is attempting to raise money to fund a terrorist organisation by playing in a high stakes poker game at the Casino Royale. MI6 sends Bond out there to play against him, knowing that if Bond wins, Le Chiffre's organisation will collapse. He is kept under surveillance by the sultry, yet equally austere agent Vesper Lynd.Casino Royale is a revamp of the Bond series in the same sense that MI:3 was a revamp of the Mission:Impossible series. Everything is noticeably tougher, particularly Bond, himself, who is catering towards the image that Ian Fleming originally envisaged him being ¬ñ tough is nails, and twice as dangerous. Daniel Craig is well adept at playing psychopaths and crazed bad guys, and his incarnation of 007 has no issue with kicking the living daylights out of his enemies, as is painfully displayed in the opening sequence of him repeatedly smashing some poor sod's face in. He slyly smiles when a terrorist is blown to smithereens by the bomb he attached to the hapless assailant, and murders a bomb maker, when all the surrounding circumstances suggest the best thing to do is drop his weapons, and swallow his pride. But this isn't what our cerebral assassin is meant to be anymore. He's an unflinching killer ¬ñ the antithesis of Roger Moore. Gone is the light-hearted cheese, and back are the scars. The film is also a lot darker than previous incarnations. There is the infamous torture scene, sure to have any bloke in the audience writhing in their seats with discomfort. And many a plot twist to keep our audience guessing. We even get a glimpse of character depth, as James' career choice is put into perspective for a more substantial existence, even if the ensuing twist sap a lot of the film's momentum.Yet when all is said and done ¬ñ this is still Un Film a la Bond ¬ñ complete with all the throwaway clich√©s common within typical Hollywood blockbusters. The bad guy's guns never have any bullets left when they finally get to shoot the hero, Le Chiffre is typically rich and surrounded by goons all the time, and the circumstances that MI6 come up with in order to capture him are just completely ludicrous ¬ñ the way to stop terrorism is to beat terrorists at poker? Terrific. There is never a dull entrance in a 007 film; we are introduced to our first Bond girl, as she rides across the Bahamian beach side on horseback of all things. Nor is there a dull location, as Casino Royale travels through the tropical terrains of Uganda, the familiarly glorious site of London's skyline, the beautiful beaches of the Bahamas and Montenegro for that infamous card game. But even if it is typically empty-headed ¬ñ this isn't as issue with James Bond. The 007 franchise is meant to be hyperbolic and super-realised. We are not meant to relate to our protagonist, but just be impressed by his dead-cool, icy persona. And boy is Casino Royale cool at times. Those who yearn for some sort of psychological depth to our hero will be disappointed, as will those thinking that this movie at any point attempts to make an intelligent film. What is refreshing about Casino Royale is does not conform to the CGI network imposing itself over modern Hollywood cinema. The action is riotously good fun, and we get stunts galore as well as real explosions and old-fashioned criminal chases, as Daniel Craig literally smashes through walls in Martin Campbell's movie. It is certainly tougher viewing than recent offerings, such as Die Another Day (2002), which was much more concerned with Halle Berry than it was with James Bond. But this is, in effect, a continuation of the things that everyone associates with 007: beautiful girls, fast cars, glorious locales and plenty of explosions. Darker, tougher and more faithful than previous Bond incarnations, Casino Royale is nevertheless an ephemeral experience. If you want a fresh approach to the spy genre ¬ñ try the Bourne movies. If what you are after is purely empty-brained, head-cracking action, this delivers everything it promised, if not more.",7,0,2,17 November 2006
Live Free or Die Hard," IF you're going to keep milking an ancient cash cow, you might as well milk it for all it's worth - which is exactly what Bruce Willis & co do
","In the fourth instalment of the Die Hard series, John McClane is caught up in a wicked game of cyber terrorism when asked to transport young computer hacker Matt to the department of homeland security. After an assassination attempt on both men at MAtt's apartment, the conspiracy becomes reality as an elite group of cyber terrorists attempt to shut down America's computer infrastructure and bring the country to its knees. Their only hope is John McClane shooting the hell out of everyone, including logic, originality but sadly not clich√©.Whilst there is some fine action in Die Hard 4.0 to please even the most cynical of cinema dwellers, the definitive arm that shielded the Die Hard franchise from ham-fisted hokum has now unclutched itself from the franchise. In the original Die Hard - John McClane was an everyman. An ordinary schmo, who just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. It is made abundantly clear from the first frame occupied by My Willis that McClane is now a walking monolith with god like tendencies, that no amount of criminal minds can figure out. In this movie alone our protagonist is thrown out of a speeding car, falls out of a jet fighter into a the back of a lorry taxi, gets shot at and walks through a whole host of things that diminish any sense of believability in the subject. It is credit then, to the film's hugely entertaining action set-pieces, that none of this bothered me to any great extent. It may look like a thousand other action movies, but it doesn't slug along quite as slowly.",6,1,2,13 September 2007
Munich," Politically it ticks all the right boxes. Dramatically it is somewhat wanting.
","Attacked in equal measures by some as being anti-Israeli and apologetic towards Palestinian terrorists and others as Pro-state terrorism, Munich is actually quite balanced in it's views, and despite all the controversy and hoopla it has already caused actually has a rather simple message: Acts of terrorism, on any surface, never serve a worthy cause, and will only encourage more acts of terror. Spielberg does his best to lecture us on this, but unfortunately gets lost between a standard thriller and a political lecture.The opening of the film plays out somewhat like an unnarrated documentary, interchanging between the reconstructed hostage situation of the 1972 Olympics and old news reel footage. This actually works, but also underlines the problems with the film. Are we supposed to view this unattached or should we look at how this effects the characters, rather than the world? Most of the film appears to play out with a scene of people sitting round a table talking, then things blow up. Sit around talking, then things blow up. And so on. And yes there are very impressive set pieces, some engaging moments - the flashbacks to the 1972 hostage situation are probably the most impressive. Unfortunately the film has made some sacrifices - notably dramatic weight. Spielberg is torn between doing a glorified documentary - a la Andrew Niccol's Lord Of War - or a political thriller. And as such we never truly feel for the film, in the same way as I felt when I saw Michael Mann's The Insider (1999). What impressed me the most about that film is an incredibly convoluted story about a subject that would never lead to widespread interest actually made for a darn good thriller. The film is too long. It does take it's time in some of it's scenes, and I was reminded of other films half the length with the same message. Once it gets going however you will be impressed. The assassination scenes are all done very well, and much like war movies show how anything involving violence can go wrong and end up accidentally killing or injuring innocent civilians. However, what bogs these scenes down is when it then cuts to other scenes of people talking about the benevolence of their actions. Sometimes it makes for interesting listening - Avnar (Bana) is talking to a Palestinian terrorist about why they fight - but other times it just feels contrived. Do assassins REALLY debate like this? And if they don't, why doesn't it help the film?The performances are all solid. Eric Bana is particularly well cast as our protagonist. Although it did take me half the film to work out what accent Daniel Craig was actually using.The subject of Munich is especially relevant in the wake of 9/11. It is no coincidence that the final words of the film 'Have you learnt anything?' are spoken with the World Trade Centre glaring in the backdrop. Undoubtedly this is one of Spielberg's bravest films and it certainly isn't a bad one. It is an important film that everyone should see. No doubt this'll probably end up with a caboodle of awards - and whilst it does end up as an overlong - especially in it's denouement - slightly trite piece of work, you will walk away glad that you saw it. It is undoubtedly flawed, but still effecting and thought provoking.",7,0,0,2 February 2006
300," Romping, empty-headed fun
","Based on the Frank Miller (he of Sin City fame) graphic novel of the same name, 300 is set in ancient Greece. An army of 300 Spartans battled with a million-trillion-bajiillion Persian hoards long enough to save their modest city of Sparta from being pillaged. A cast of no-names, led by Glaswegian gladiator Gerard Butler, carry the film through the bloody battles, but it is the gory details of the film's visceral visuals that take centre stage. With lashings of baby oil, a whole vogue catalogue full of face piercings and not a single chest hair in sight, historians will bicker about both the film's blatant inaccuracies and apparent protofascist mentality. The truth is, it is neither of those things. It is a great big dumb action-adventure story, with a very annoying voice-over narrative, and lots of sweaty men in loin-cloths hitting each other (and occasionally shouting HAA-OOOHH!). None of 300 is meant to be taken seriously, as made apparent by the blatant lack of any substance to be found in the film. It is certainly true that, once the battles stop, the film stops too. But those battles are pretty sharp all the same.",6,2,5,18 April 2007
The Pursuit of Happyness," Genuinely moving, and tear-inducing, tale of one man's struggle against absolutely everything.
","As the main protagonist in Gabriele Muccino's unsentimental film points out ¬ñ 'The pursuit of happiness' is written in to the declaration of independence. Happiness might not be, but the pursuit is. And I suppose the point of this film is to show just how miserable that pursuit can be ¬ñ as all manner of things go wrong for Will Smith, son Jaden, and ever-bitchy wife (Newton).Chris Gardner is a salesman down on his luck. Having invested his life savings in techno-marvellous (but unnecessarily expensive) bone scanners, he finds it extremely difficult to sell enough just to feed his family. His wife (a thanklessly bitchy role for Thandie Newton) has clearly had enough, and threatens to leave if Chris doesn't pick up paychecks any time soon. One day Chris sees a grin-infested man exiting an exquisitely swish sports car on his way to work. In a chance encounter, he queries to him as to what he does to earn such luxuries. He responds, 'I'm a stockbroker'. And from there, Gardner decides to pursue his own version of 'Happiness', albeit through a very hard route.For the most part ¬ñ The Pursuit of Happiness is more of a disaster movie than a fish-out-of-water tale. After getting accepted for an internship at a stockbroking firm, the film operates as a series of events in which absolutely everything conspires against our hero and his son. From mad hippies attempting to steal his bone scanners to getting arrested for not paying parking fines, the film ¬ñ despite being inspired by real events ¬ñ depicts some ridiculous situations that send our hero near to the brink of bonkers. Yet despite this, The Pursuit of Happiness never feels forced, perhaps thanks to the fine performance of its lead. Smith is on fine form, as is his son Jaden, acting with a natural charm and verve that presumably runs in the family. In between the moments of anguish and desperation are some truly moving moments of father-son bonding, one of which involves our two hapless heroes having to spend the night in a train station toilet, to avoid snoozing in the street. But by the end of the film you should feel no shame in shedding a deserved tear for Gardner, as the movie manages to avoid the kind of schmaltzy sentimentality that rolls the eyes against so many other Hollywood films, for a truly heartfelt ending that gives our characters the kind of reward they have worked so diligently for. It is a hard watch at the best of times, but will win you over in the end.",7,2,3,28 January 2007
Cinderella Man," Solid biopic with great performances
","The fact that this film is based on real-life events makes it all the more astonishing. I would still advise all people wanting to see this to know as little as possible about the back story as possible. I really didn't know how this one was going to pan out. And when it finished, it made it all the more invigorating.Russell Crowe plays James Braddock, a depression era boxer who loses everything after the Wall Street Crash of 1929. After landing a temporary position as a dock yard worker, Braddock finds himself with little means to support his family. His old time manager - played wonderfully by Paul Giamatti - decides to get him in the ring for one last showdown, as the scheduled contender had to withdraw. Seeing this as a way of making a potentially life saving $250, Braddock accepts the challenge - much to the worry of his wife (Renee Zellwenger). The film then chronicles his subsequent re-rise through the boxing ranks, as he defies all the odds and becomes labelled 'The Cinderella Man'.As a spectacle, the film is wonderful. The boxing scenes are in my opinion the best filmed since Raging Bull - and I do not say that lightly. You really do feel like ribs are being crushed and craniums cracked. You will be gripping the edge of your seat. On an emotional level the film borderlines between warm sentiment and mawkish schmaltz, although it definitely evoked far more heartfelt smiles then it did rolled eyes.Russell Crowe is on top form. His best performance is still Jeffrey Wigand in The Insider (1999), but this one is definitely up there along with Gladiator (2000). Equally effective is Paul Giamatti, and I think both men deserve Oscar recognition, especially after Giamatti was completely overlooked for his wonderful turn in Sideways (2004).A really good, really exciting, heartfelt piece of work.",7,1,2,30 January 2006
The Simpsons Movie," The glaring faults of any movie become transparent when you laugh so hard at it
","In what has perhaps been one of the drollest and most insipid summers in recent Hollywood history, it is not surprising that the 'saviour' of the cineworld would turn out to be those weird, squiggly-lined, yellow folk from the tellybox. Yes it's The Simpsons movie, or rather, at last it is The Simpsons' movie, for we have waited many a full moon (and many cries of D'oh!, most of which from me whilst watching the latest series) for Matt Groening, James L. Brooks et al to finally enlighten us as to what Springfield's finest would add to grand old experience of the cinema. Indeed, that curiosity slowly but severely began to wain, with every passing series of The Simpsons becoming even more depressing than the last. As a huge mark for the programme I felt increasingly concerned about the motivation for diluting what was once the pinnacle of television programmes into a sad pantomime of its former self. Homer, despite being wackier than ever, was no longer funny. And Bart, ever the smart mouthed rebel, was just not cool anymore. Had the series lost its edge? Or was it just impossible to keep up the unenviable task of maintaining the quality of the greatest TV sitcom of all time? All the reasons questioned are valid, but milking the cashcows that are The Simsons means that long after their peak (a good solid decade now) we are still enduring our yellow friends deep into the 21st century. Like any great pugilist staggering on his last legs, The Simpsons refused to stop running, even after its creator, Matt Groening, left the show. So forgive me for approaching The Simpsons Movie with considerable trepidation.So given the stigma of what The Simpsons had become still fresh in my mind, I am proud to say I entered the screening with an open mind. And despite what any expectations were, despite how sick I had grown of hearing Homer or Bart belt out yet another token catchphrase, in the 87 minutes I spent in and around Springfield that night, I laughed harder at the movie then I had at any movie seen this year. And it isn't hard to explain why. The writing is back. The team that made the Simpsons what it is reminded me of what made the series great. It is politically savvy, boisterously inventive and the stupid jokes are actually smartly played. The movie doesn't rely on audiences trusting Homer's reputation enough to laugh at anything he says. When a character makes you laugh, it is because they are are funny, not because of nostalgia. Even silly jokes that don't mean anything like the now infamous 'Spider pig' have a sense of investment behind the delivery.And all of this is crucial, because as far as the story goes, The Simpsons Movie is as mundane and formulaic as the dumbest Hollywood blockbuster around. There is little room for Lisa's new found romance to mean anything, and Bart's desire for fatherly support in spite of his own will seem recycled to regular Simpsonites and clich√©d to the uninitiated. It is also worth pointing out that the movie fails to fully realise the potential of the cinematic medium, with only the score, and an abundance of undercooked character cameos (Mr Burns only gets two scenes!) failing to convince the cinema that it belongs there. And yet none of this matters much, for you will be laughing too hard to care. The important thing is that faith has been rightly restored in a series that had stubbornly refused to get off the TV train when the lights were still on. But smiling at the word 'Doh!' for the first time in years is something worth forgiving for all its faults.",7,0,0,1 October 2007
Atonement," Weighty, ambitious and visually arresting, Atonement almost makes amends for its lack of dramatic weight
","Atonement is a film exploring the consequences of love, and the guilt one carries when attempting to destroy it. Starting in the hot British summer 1935, we join a courtship between Robbie Turner and Cecilia Tallis, told through the eyes of Cecilia's 13-year-old sister Briony. Peeking from inside a house window she views her sister stripping off in front of Robbie and then plunging herself into the fountain in the garden of their country house. By the end of the day their lives will have changed forever, as the scheming imagination of Briony will have run its rage over the lives of the two lovers.Cecilia (Keira Knightley) has travelled down from Cambridge; Robbie (James McAvoy), her university contemporary and son of her parents' housekeeper is dabbling with landscape gardening; and her brother Leon (Patrick Kennedy) is coming to dinner with a friend, the arrogant industrialist Paul Marshall (Benedict Cumberbatch). The performances are enjoyable and spot-on: Cecilia's brittle beauty; Robbie's educated but tempered confidence; the wily camaraderie between Leon and Marshall.Cecilia clearly harbours an attraction to her university contemporary, but her inherent snobbishness towards his attachment to the more servile classes stilt her feelings somewhat. The class divide is tested even further, when her younger sibling Briony (a fantastic turn from Saoirse Ronan), who herself is dabbling in the arts of playwriting and novels, envelops her own imagination with a warped perception of their relationship. Robbie is branded a 'sex maniac' and accused of raping Briony's friend and cousin Lola (Juno Temple). The accusations and stigma will haunt Briony, Cecilia and Robbie for the rest of their lives, the next chapter of which follows them through World War II. Briony, staring at her deathbed in the contemporary era, attempts to atone for her guilt by writing what she really saw, and what really happened during the summer of 1935.Joe Wright, at the age of 35, clearly has a interesting future ahead of him There are times during Atonement when the style and flourish of the film's movement is elevated through its direction. He sees his films intricately and along with cinematographer Seamus McGarvey paints them vastly and beautifully. When he made Pride & Prejudice, the popular call was that he had made Jane Austen 'muddy', despite the fact it was as pastorally arresting as any of Austen's novel's should be. Atonement is the same. It switches from the beauty of the Tallis country home to the grotty urbanism of wartime London with equal aplomb. He is clearly a director with an interesting style of film-making, but it is questionable whether he is utilises his gifts appropriately during the film. One sequence, a breathtaking long-take following Robbie's worn-out soldier walking along one of the French beaches, is both visually arresting and technically marvellous. But all it accumulates to is visual swaggery on Wright's part. What Atonement lacks in buckets is the kind of emotional attachment any loves story desperately relies. Wright attempting to make up for the general lack of involvement in these latter sequences resorts to showing off his technical hands, maybe hoping we haven't noticed how engaging the story is getting. It is a darn shame, far too much of one unfortunately, since the ambition and weight of Atonement make a movie you will want to love. Some people do, and it leads me to question my own interpretation of the film that they something out of it to treasure. But in my opinion there are far too many problems that match the movie's huge ambition. Keira Knightly, for all her hard work, doesn't possess the dramatic weight to make us feel for her character. Far too often is the pain lacking, when it is clear we are meant to be heartbroken at both her's and her lover's fate. I wanted to feel the sorrow of her character, and the closest you come to that is through the guilt and anguish displayed through Romola Garai's performance as the wartime Briony.When the end reveals itself, it is genuinely moving, but a part of me felt as though the film had not earned the right to take me to that place. I still feel there is a great movie to be made on this subject, one that overcomes the literary trappings of the novel, and doesn't give distance to the audience through its more dramatic scenes. I still think people should see it, there is enough worth discussing and much to be admired. It is a beautiful, ambitious and weighty failure. One that will stay with you after you've seen it.",7,4,6,3 October 2007
