Your Name.," beautiful but a bit predictable
","I don't usually write reviews, but I feel like I need to say something about this film, even if the majority of reviews will be overwhelmingly positive. And I'm pretty terrible with these things b/c I don't have a photographic memory.Anyhow, it's a story of boy and girl switching bodies after a cosmic event involving a comet that's never really explained. This happens a few times each week, much to the chagrin of each of our main characters and amusing fun for the supporting cast. I don't want to say much else beyond that without giving away plot details. Needless to say, they start to fall in love with each other as they're living each other's lives.It's a beautiful film. There's one particular sequence in the middle that I absolutely loved visually.The movie started to fall apart towards the last 30-45 minutes once it rushes to resolve a problem introduced in the latter half of the film. It feels like the film needed a bit more running time to avoid this. There's also a bunch of suspension of disbelief required...I mean I guess this is to be expected, but for me, a films starts to lose me once there's too much serendipity involved to resolve everything.Also, I think the film would've gotten better mileage if it had gone down the bittersweet route when rushing to its end.I left the theater liking the film, but it's not like it's the most amazing film I've ever seen (even if it broke the box office record in Japan), nor did it really leave me with tingly happy feelings like after watching some Studio Ghibli films.",7,5,8,17 April 2017
Spider-Man 3," Doesn't compare at all to the first 2 films in the series
","OK, perhaps 1 is a bit harsh, but I felt that there's some demographic out there that's not accurately reflecting the awfulness of this film. It's nowhere near the 7.3 it's reflecting right now! I would recommend that anybody who wants to see this should wait for DVD. Aside from CG effects (some of which look fake anyway), the film is quite empty. There are too many villains, first of all. B/c of the number, they end up being half-developed and lacking character. There's inconsistency as to why there's even a meltdown in MJ's and Peter's relationship. Characters also completely act out of character.If you want to see a review that's dead-on, read the one posted in the S.F. Chronicle by Mick LaSalle. It'll convince not to waste your valuable time on this movie.",1,9,15,6 May 2007
