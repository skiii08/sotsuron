Lucky Number Slevin," one of the best movies I have ever seen
","I watch a lot of movies and absolutely hate blood shed in a movie but in this one, with the fantastic plot line, it was all worth while. I watched the movie for the second time in a little over a week and loved it just as much because there were definitely some small subtleties I didn't catch the first time around. The acting is fantastic with a kick-ass plot and a wonderful cast, it a great movie that I would recommend to anyone... and do not read spoilers, it will ruin the movie for you... I loved Italian Job and movies of that nature and this beats them all hands down. This is a must see movie and anyone who couldn't make sense of it or didn't understand it, either wasn't paying attention or really just walked out because of the initial fast paced action.",8,1,8,16 April 2006
