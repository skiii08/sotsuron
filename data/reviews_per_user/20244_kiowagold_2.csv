First Man," Very dark
","Did the producers forget to pay the electric bill? Many scenes looked like they were shot at the bottom of a coal mine. The overall theme of the movie was not an uplifting story and didn't portray NASA in a positive way. This could have been a positive chronicle of the USA space program in the 50s and 60s but there was so much focus on the negatives and failures (and there were failures) and how the Russians were so much better and doing everything before the USA....except landing a man on the moon and returning to earth. The best thing about this film is I didn't pay to see it. I got a DVD from my local library for free. If you have 2 hours and 20 minutes to waste it's an OK film. Otherwise, use your time to do something more enjoyable.",Null,3,4,27 May 2019
Fifty Shades of Grey," Beyond awful
",He had to tie her up to keep her from running away from this movie. I wonder if they tied the audience to their seats to keep them from running away? This movie is beyond stupid. Who knew a twenty-something college graduate could be so incredibly gullible. Thank god I didn't actually pay to see this 'drama' in a theater. On the other hand it does put you to sleep in a rather gentle way without drugs. I wonder why she never tied up Mr. S & M man? It would have made a more interesting movie.,1,2,3,6 May 2017
