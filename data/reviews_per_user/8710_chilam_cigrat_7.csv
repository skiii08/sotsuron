Iron Man 3," Fantastic..Just Fantastic..
","Yup,This was the most beautiful and attractive film I've seen in a long time.I'm even going to go to the extent of saying that it was the best in the series. The things that made it the best in the series for me,and made it so attractive and worth watching over and over again were following..A great story-line,great acting,great development and finally(and the best of all) an absolute gem of a villain in Aldrich Killian(Guy Pearce).. I'm not going to post lots of spoilers here because that usually 'spoils' the movie for people,but i am going to absolutely recommend it to everyone.The scenes are very well filmized,with the marvel of 'Marvel comics' coming through to full effect.Tony Stark was always great at whatever he did.This time though,he has achieved a level of greatness that is always expected of a super-hero. I'm a big fan of all the Avengers,and i am so glad that this movie just opens up so many doors..",9,1,9,1 May 2013
Memento," One of the best i've ever seen
","A great movie with such a great script and idea that it literally play around with the viewer's mind.The movie is based on the a person who is a patient of retrograde amnesia.He got this retrograde amnesia(Temporary memory loss)after he had a trauma.He remembers everything before the trauma but he forgets everything that happens after his trauma.He tries to remember stuff,by taking pictures and writing notes on back of the pictures.but he forgets whatever he's doing every 15 to 20 mins.All in all,a great idea,Good acting,Great screenplay..Movie runs backwards in time.It starts at the end of the story and end at the start.Its completely upon the viewer to figure stuff out.A must see movie recommended for people who like to keep their minds open during the movie and pay attention..",10,0,2,11 December 2009
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Don't care what people say,I LIKED IT!!!
","wow wow..I really liked it!I mean,yes i am a huge game fan and so it was pretty easy for me to engulf the plot as i was expecting it,but still there were some surprises and some really cool graphics that i loved!I must say though,that being a game fan is an important factor if you want to like this movie..And Jake did a great job as my favorite game character,Prince of Persia..I hope that they don't just sit back,I WANT ANOTHER MOVIE IN THIS SERIES PEOPLE!!SOON!!!!Loved it,Absolutely recommended,especially for The game fans..i could go into the movie story and plot but i'll just go for the positives and not bore you with the negatives.I liked the graphics,liked the sound effects,liked Jake's acting,liked the Dagger's part and how it was made,I liked that weird guy's snakes and his weapon(Which is also a weapon that prince of Persia himself uses in the third game,the two thrones),and finally and i think the most important thing that i liked was the ending..they could have made a boring ending and ruined the movie but i think they managed to crack it.Way to go mates,hope to see you soon again prince of Persia..cheers..",7,9,17,30 May 2010
The Butterfly Effect," Brilliant brilliant JUST BRILLIANT
","THIS is absolutely how i want my movies and how i want them to end,it would have been a little better if the end was a little more tragic because then it would've been proved that the so called fate cannot be changed..Anyways,i have no complaints mates.This is just a classic which is absolutely under-rated..it should be there somewhere with the very best of the movies.The reason for this movie to be rated under 9 might be that it does not have a happy sweet feeling about it.It is not like other science fiction movies that leave you either fully satisfied in the end or leave you just wondering.It explains everything without any suspense left for the end.This movie is recommended for anyone.Just phenomenal,thats what i would say.I say give this movie a chance,don't watch it as a critic mates,just give it a teeny tiny chance.I KNOW you would like it if you can watch it without criticism..cheers mates..",9,0,1,26 June 2010
Kick-Ass," Did NOT like it at all.
","I don't get it,i just don't!I mean,whats to like in this movie!?it wasn't a comedy,it wasn't a superhero movie,it wasn't a teen movie and it wasn't an action or an adventure.I just don't know what this movie was about!I see the comments here and see that a movie like this gets one of the top ranks and i just wonder what the heck is wrong with people who rank the movies.For me this movie was a complete waste of time,I gained absolutely nothing from it and these are the kinds of movies that i hate.I implore you all in humblest words,go watch this movie and see if you like it.Donot believe what others want you to believe,just see it for yourself and see if there is anything to like..I KNOW that there isn't anything in this movie..WASTE WASTE WASTE.",1,30,60,29 June 2010
The Green Mile," One of the best movies
","Yup,This is exactly what a great movie should be like.Amazing story,amazing direction,amazing acting by all the actors. It was an extremely touching story and its a kind of a movie that leaves a mark on the viewer.Hollywood took a major step ahead in its progress with this movie. I don't usually review that many movies but this movie was so extra- ordinary that i had to say Hats-off,and say something good about it.Go ahead everyone,watch this movie.People who haven't watched this movie,you guys are missing a treat.All the Hollywood viewers just have to see this to appreciate good cinema.One thing though,The movie's run-time is a bit long and that might prompt some people not to watch this movie.I urge you all in a very humble way,NOT to mind the long run- time.Its a great movie.It just IS!",10,1,2,6 July 2013
Donnie Darko," GREAT!Different(In a good way)
","People who love science fiction,THis movie is for you all..I strongly recommend this movie.New and great idea to go with Jake's fantastic natural acting makes it a truly terrific movie to watch..The main point that this movie was able to score is that even after the movie is finished,you aren't sure about the idea of the movie.You cant just look at this movie from a simple physical point of view.This movie's idea can only be grasped and understood by looking at it from a philosophical perspective to go with the science fiction perspective.A great movie,completely different(in a good way).Again,i strongly recommend this movie to sci fi lovers who like to keep their minds in the movie when they watch it..",9,0,1,5 December 2009
