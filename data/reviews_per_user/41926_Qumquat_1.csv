Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," How was this movie created?
","Surely some of this movie was staged. The question of course, is, how much. It is awfully hard to believe that the participants in this movie were not aware of the presence of cameras and cameramen and/or camerawomen. How much of it was scripted? Also, is a release not required to show the people Borat is interacting with on film? Why would some of these people sign a release if what they said on film cast them in a bad light? Do they not realize what they sound like? Did they sign a release beforehand? Then how could they be unaware of what was going on? I might give as an example, the dinner party talking behind Borat's back while he was upstairs. However, even if it was staged, I definitely killed myself laughing.",Null,2,4,4 November 2006
