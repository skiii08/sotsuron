The Blair Witch Project," Awful, MTV-footage non-horror movie
","This is undoubtedly one of the worst horror films I've ever seen.  What is most criminal of all is that all the media hype and my friends were like, 'Oh, it's *SO* scary!'  What a load of crap!The story centers around three stuck-up kids who decide to film a 'documentary' about a mythical haunt who lives in the Maryland woods.  This is an excuse to justify 80 minutes of hand-held MTV-ish footage of dark woods and the slowly deteriorating mental state of the characters after they get themselves lost.   They get scared because of odd noises and objects they encounter after they get lost in the woods.Of course, the movie never actually SHOWS what makes these noises--instead we get stupid myths, a bunch of cursing and screaming from the actors, and a lot of scared and very shaky camera footage.  Even in the amusing final five minutes of the film, where SOMETHING ACTUALLY HAPPENS (or at least the pace increases), the film NEVER establishes what is going on!  I was left with a bad taste in my mouth.Only good part of the film: my girlfriend was terrified and held close to me for the entire film.  It was quite romantic.",1,1,2,6 August 1999
