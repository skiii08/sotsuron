Mission: Impossible III," Horrible, shoot 'Em up plot less junk
","I like Mi 1 and I thought Mi 2 was OK, but mi 3 is over the top (bottom).I watched this on a plane trip to Kauai and boy was I wow'ed at how stupid the whole thing was. I was more amazed that it got a 6.8 / 10! Did Tom pay reviewers? Did they toss out votes that were low like mine? The special effects were the worst part. So overdone as to kill all sense of reality. It is about as believable as if I ran from San Diego to Hollywood on I-5 against traffic and no one hit me. Yeah right.The fight scenes were stupid long camera rolling scenes. The virus glass thing never breaks after falling off a building and rolling through a busy street? How can IMDb's members' radar be so bent? In a world of confusion, you can always trust Mrbios",1,10,19,30 October 2006
Children of Men," Not very good, had potential but never delivers
",A neighbor suggested it. It did not sound very good. I looked on IMDb and saw the ratings were very high. But walkingn out of the theater I was disappointed and so were the other two people that I went to the movies with.It keeps you entertained and in suspense but never delivers the 'human project' also when the bad guys show up at ever turn it strains credibility. Ther is too much meaningless shooting and it is almost dream like especially towards the end.One get-away takes too long - it had me saying go or stay. A bad guy announces 'I got a clean shot' why would he not have take it? Save your money and more importantly your time and common sense.,1,6,13,10 February 2007
Signs," Senseless, pointless, long boring, no character development, no redemption.
","I saw this movie in Spanish with English subtitles at an orphanage in Tijuana this past Sunday. It was pure standard formula. The kids laughed at some of the scenes that were supposed to be scary while I jumped (maybe a cultural or age thing or both - lol).The weird shapes on the DVD cover and Gibson make it seem more interesting that it really was.I looked it up on here and was shocked to see it was made in 2002. It looked so budget (partly due to the old projection TV) that I would have guessed it was made in the late 80's or early 90's.No redemption, no higher moral ground gained, Not plot twister. Endless time wasting footage. It try's to play on your fear to keep you going and count on you being a couch potato. It's main goal was to make money not entertain you. Gibson must have been like a 10000 gorilla getting a see-saw with the rest of the cast and crew and blasting over the moon... A thousand dollars for Mel, $1 for everyone and everything else.I'm Catholic like Gibson; the little bits of religion tossed in were a joke. The ending was very formula predictable, I even guessed close to what the solution was without watching (I asked someone how it finally ended). Skip-it with confidence.",2,2,3,16 August 2005
