The Avengers," Live Action Team America
","Marvel only hires TeeVee directors for a reason. The visual effects work has already been previzzed. All they need is someone competent to film the spoken bits in between the cartoon-like action bits. But this movie set an interesting precedent: the reliance of Hollywood on the Chinese movie goers. No movie can possibly gross over a billion dollars without the Chinese audience these days. Americans are largely tapped out.What is seen here should make you sit up and notice- and the China market for Hollywood blockbusters is as large as the US market. Captain America is presented as the leader of the team, but he is played as a dull-witted, good-hearted American soldier taking command just because he showed up. He is given deference, but he is not respected at all. Even the NYPD police captain disrespects him - until he demonstrates his martial arts ability, then it's all 'yes sir, right away sir'.He is manipulated by the government and military leaders, and by Stark too, yet supplied with the most extraordinary technology. He even - and no one should be surprised by this - has access to the powers of the other worlds. The blond hair and Germanic manner really stand out here. Stark is also American but his portrayal here is a complete 180 from Cap: Stark's politics are correct, and Cap's politics are not.The sequels would change up his hair color (Thor at one point in his movies had bleached eyebrows!). But the portrayal would remain the same: dim and dull. This is the only version of Captain America global audiences will accept.",5,2,3,22 November 2019
Blade Runner 2049," Sylvia hooked me
","You should see this movie just for the Luv character. One of the best performances in a movie I've seen in ages.Harrison Ford as an actor (and person) is largely clueless about the forces that buffeted him to stardom and surround him to this day, so he was a natural as the lead for the first movie: a character who doesn't know if he's human or not.Gosling is similarly clueless, so it didn't require much effort on his part here.The photography here is astounding. The director is going on to do the Dune remake and I'm excited about that.",8,4,6,27 November 2019
Vertigo," A film about filmmaking
","This movie can be appreciated for any number of things about it. For me, two things come to mind. The first is the restaurant scene in the beginning. The elaborate use of red and green. The second is the flashback to the explanation of the murder. It's remarkable for the economy, it's just a few brief scenes.The power of a director is where he can fill in the gaps between the script and the screen. And why I think this is the most personal of the Hitchcock movies is because this is a movie about making movies. Scottie 'directs' Judy to become the woman he was obsessed with so she can be the star of his movie. The film is dreamlike, artificially constructed with many backscreen projections and cinematic artifices. It's entirely possible this film could be a love letter to one of the actresses Hitchcock directed previously.",8,5,6,27 July 2019
Scarface," Diet Coke please
","I wrote a comment for Carlito's Way so I figured I would do one for this movie, they are considered companion pieces. I'll let others comment on the circumstances of the movie. Yes, Oliver Stone wrote the screenplay. Yes, the boat lift really happened. Yes, America still loved cocaine. The movie is colorful, over the top, and vulgar. Pacino imitated a sledgehammer. And this is just exactly what Pacino does best. But dePalma made an interesting decision.Never once does the camera eye share Tony's perspective. The perspective is from a distance, always outside personal spaces until the very end when he murders his brand new brother in law. Since we don't share any personal perspectives, the camera crane swoops and relentless panning have to emote so the narrative has substance.There are three cruxes to the narrative: the stereotype of the Latin manner of self-satisfaction, the gangster movie ethic of gimme gimme gimme, and the church of sex & drugs. Stone does a good job with the tension among these three. Sex is ultimately what everyone in this movie thinks they desire, but they end up like zombines being zonked out on cocaine all the time, so they can't even be bothered to have sex. dePalma uses each excess in his style: sometimes with great effect. The sets are so theatrical they approach fantasy; the moves of the camera are greater when the architecture has grand features. When Montana is stoned, the camera is stationary. When he is jumpy and agitated, the cutting suddenly takes on energy. The ambush in the nightclub was masterfully staged and edited.The best sequence cinematically (to my mind) is the attack in the Babylon, with the pans and mirrors, but there are other fine visual treats here. Credit the director. Most films are about other films -- this one is largely original.The women here are interesting. The scornful mother, the perpetually stoned trophy girlfriend and the sister - the actress playing her is on fire! Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, who would largely disappear from Hollywood films after 'The Abyss', which by all accounts was a very unpleasant production so who can blame her.",8,2,4,28 December 2018
Walk the Line," Hollywood Bologna. Walk Hard is the better movie.
","This movie was so bad it inspired one of the best comedy satires of all time - Walk Hard.I predict film schools will be using this movie 30 years from now for classes titled 'how not to insult your ticket buying audience'.Joaquin is a maniac in real life by any indication, so it's no surprise he's the go to guy in Hollywood for maniac roles.Reese was so into her role she played the 'First Lady of the South' routine all the way through to her Oscars appearance.The sun studios scene is now already legendary for how lazy it was.Robert Patrick bit down so hard on his role as the father that Walk Hard spoofed him mercilessly over and over with the 'the wrong kid died' line.",1,2,6,30 January 2020
Se7en," Ordinary
","I recently saw this again after not having seen it over 15 years.The passage of time illuminates things. Pitt is very committed to creating his character here - he worries, he prepares, he submits to the narrative. He makes his job look easy, that's how you know he has talent.Freeman on the other hand, was head long into his slide into mediocrity. His acting style is take it or leave it, forcing the other actors to come to him. Watch his scenes closely with R. Lee Ermey, the legendary Marine DI. Ermey forces Freeman to come to him! It was amusing watching him almost get upstaged. They only have a few scenes together, but Ermey dominates everyone.Considering what we know about Spacey know, one has to wonder how easily he connected with his character.Upon a repeat viewing, the sloppiness of the thing becomes apparent. The plot hinges on the two cops having unauthorized access to a secret FBI library list, which they are able to access by bribing a federal employee.The only thing that impresses is the lighting. It actually takes a lot of time and work to light up a movie to appear so darkly.Fincher was finding his way. Fight Club would come up soon and it's the vastly superior movie.",5,1,2,26 December 2019
The Big Lebowski," Raising Shifting Realities
","The Coen brothers rank very highly in my movie world. They're smart as hell, and have a great camera eye. But what they do best is run wild with cinematic narratives.Here we have Bridges as a stoner, Goodman doing a John Milius impersonation, Buscemi as himself referencing Fargo, and Julianne Moore poking fun at almost every pretentious actress in Hollywood (demonstrating 3 levels of abstraction here: Herself, herself as an actress, and her character 'performing' in the world of the movie as an abstract artist). Her finishing school accent is hilarious. We even have Sam Elliot as a cowboy Greek chorus.The story is, there is no story, because it's Chandler-esque, but also the drug use supports the shifting realities. It's a screwball character piece and the real joy is watching the performers perform.",8,1,2,12 December 2019
Star Trek," Take a pass
","The plot here is Spock is emotionally compromised. Because they needed the most contrived story ever to get Jim Kirk up on the bridge.Check out the writers. If you wonder how they keep getting work, it's because they went to the Crossroads school.",1,7,11,22 August 2018
Fight Club," Form without substance
","It is amusing to me to read the other reviews re-hashing the story. For me, the story is nothing. This is yet another film about movies made by a competent director, working with actors who understand his intention.The film itself has nothing important to say.It's also darkly humorous. The central conceit is actually very clever - the narrator has imagined his hero and enlisted the audience as his co-creator, because as we find out at the end, the entire film was a conversation with us, told as a flashback. They even throw in a flashback joke to bring the circle complete. This is underscored by having Pitt work a cinema projectionist. When we find out the truth about his non existence, it is portrayed on video tape.But the movie has nothing to say at all about anything - about men, about society, about shopping. That's just you staring into the movie and seeing yourself reflected back.",9,2,3,26 December 2019
Memento," Pretty close to a perfect film
","I rate this very high on my best of list for its ambition and intellect.The script is written on the body of the main character. It's a device that the TV show Blindspot would rip off.I watched this over and over and over and it took me to a place I did not want to go, because it's very dark but here I go:The main character is attacked, wife raped, him injured. He develops a fake condition to scam his insurance. The insurance investigator figures this out during a flashback in a flashback with the eletric blocksHis wife gets fed up, challenges him, he knows it, and murders her with the insulin.Sent to a hospital, he escapes and meets up with the cop who investigated the case. They track down the rapist/thief and murder him.However, the memory condition then becomes imbedded. He became his own fictional character. The crooked cop exploits a drug deal gone wrong to get the dealer, Jimmy G, murdered.Jimmy's girlfriend Natalie, the smartest character in the whole movie, figures it out and uses our memory boy to chase off the other dealer looking for the missing money.Where I got lost is where our memory boy decided he wanted to kill the crooked cop and tattooed it to his body so it would become a memory.Lenny was never an insurance investigator, his condition is self-delusional. All he did is just the same as looking at a few polaroids and trying to create/remember a past. Guy is playing 3 characters here. His own character, the borrowed character of the insurance investigator, and his made up personality as the film goes along.",9,1,1,15 August 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," The best Star Wars movie in almost 40 years
","I rewatch this all the time. It's got wicked space battles, great land action sequences, weird alien stuff and awesome visual effects. I hardly noticed that it didn't have any Jedi in it. Yes it even has emotion and well developed characters. There's no SJW nonsense to be found.I hope the folks at Disney paid attention. This movie outgrossed the last two awful star bores movies combined. It doesn't take a genius to understand why.",8,91,116,29 March 2019
The Natural," They gave it a Happy Ending.
","I'll never understand why they gave it a happy ending. It violated the whole internal logic 'Fisher King' allegory they had going on here. All the performances were pitch perfect, the cinematography was outstanding.But the ending... why?",2,1,3,25 February 2020
The Hustler," This might be the greatest American movie
","This is almost the perfect movie. The economy of scenes, spoken lines and the beautiful photography all work together to tell the story about a man who has to learn what it means to be a human being. It requires the sacrifice of a woman who truly loves him to wake this guy up to what kind of world he created for himself. This movie should be required viewing for every 12 year old girl in the world so they can be exposed to the type of people George C Scott played in this film that are really out there in the real world.",10,1,1,27 July 2018
The Prestige," Multiple Parallel Realities
","This is a film about multiple parallel realities, so astonishingly well made that I never saw the final plot twist coming.The main plot is two warring magicians (mirrored by the warring real life magicians Tesla and Edison).-The secondary plot is the realities of life pretended or performed alongside with 'real' life. We see the onstage performances, and the reality of the performers afterwards.The consequence of which is -multiple existence of beings, although they don't come right out and say 'clones'.The narrative is unrolled backwards and forwards in bits, recounted in part by two overlapping diaries, each one a ruse.The handheld camerawork is the best thing about the movie. The almost imperceptible movements, suggesting that the audience is unmentioned character, always there lurking about. It haunts me. I rematch this movie just for the camerawork sometimes.",10,3,6,10 September 2018
Alien," Fill in the blanks
","Ridley Scott's 'Alien' is still his most impressive movie, it was only his second film, that every effect is physical (the opening credits is a camera panning over a painting!), and that the budget was so low the 'spacecraft' is an odd mish mash of various components that Spaceballs would spoof with their giant 'Spaceball One' ship. More than any other directors I know except maybe Zack Snyder, Ridley Scott has the ability to create a unique look and has the mastery of craft to coordinate every element (acting, score, movement) to reinforce that look. That he chose Giger to base the look on was brilliant. Evil without the constraints of morality conveyed by an organic lifeform constantly dripping goo. The alien ship, though only briefly shown, is a sequence that will live way past the time that the monsters of the series are forgotten; that blending of beast, environment and narrative is unique in all filmdom. Really amazing that the sequels didn't go back to that ship until Prometheus, and it looked like half the audience complained about that anyway. Ridley was forced to add the classic Xenomorph in a tacked on ending sequence because the test audience demanded 'The Beast'.The movie seems to have a lot in common with 'Planet of the Vampires' although the writers deny it.The real reason I like this movie so much was because you had to fill in the gaps with your own imagination. What I filled in was that the juggernaut was an entirely bio-mechanical creation, intentionally crashed on that alien planet. The company then sent the miners, unaware, to retrieve the specimen and bring it back to earth without anyone knowing the better.The movie doesn't work without Ian Holmes. Ridley needed an actor of his caliber to play that character because the audience has to find out the same time the other characters do about his truth.",8,1,2,10 September 2018
Taxi Driver," Driving a movie
","The tension between the writer, director and lead actor is what drives a movie. The director usually wins that battle, unless the actor is highly intelligent (like Guy Pearce) or a superstar (like Tom Cruise). It's very rare for the writer to win that battle like he does here, but Paul Schrader is in the same room as John Sayles, Robert Towne, William Goldman - our finest movie writers.At the time this movie was released, a 12 year old hooker was not something being portrayed in every Hollywood movie. Watching it again lately, you can see how thin Jodie's performance was. It's no fault of her own, she had been acting since a baby. She did the best she could.The key to a movie that has the lead providing voice over narration, is that the entire movie must be something he personally witnesses. The scene with Harvey and Jodie dancing doesn't really fit into the narrative because Travis is not there in that scene. The movie - and the tension - only works if Travis is in the scene. The camera plays off Travis, and De Niro has to work his butt off to keep the attention on him. The tension in the movie works when this works.I do believe he died in the ending shoot out. The camera hovering over everyone like an angel makes that perfectly clear. There's no other reason for Cybill to get into the cab at the very end after everything that happened to her with Travis.",9,2,4,21 June 2019
Shutter Island," Unreliable Narraratives
","The evolution of Martin's career has been fascinating. For most of his movies up until Cape Fear, the camera was literally never more than 3 or 4 feet away from his actors. While he has always demonstrated a flair for moving his camera around, I found the lighting schemes to be pedestrian. He discussed this in an interview around the time Saving Private Ryan came out. He had been on the set visiting Spielberg, the famous scene where the soldiers come up over the hill in silhouette. They had been waiting hours for the sun to reach the right position in the sky. He remarked that instance would never have occurred to him, simply because he grew up in Little Italy being surrounded by skyscrapers where you would not be paying much attention to the position of the sun.This is a movie where photography matters, even more so than characters. The camera has to exist in a world apart from the characters. Space, texture, color and light are as important as the characters, perhaps even more so.The story of the movie is which reality is the Leo character living in. The story that is informing that story is the director attempting to escape his own limitations. One directly informs the other. This is why I believe there is no solid conclusion to the ending, in fact it could very possibly be all 3 things:1) It really was a cold war spy factory
2) It really was a bunch of escaped Ex-Nazis performing human experiments
3) He really was a lunatic US Marshall who murdered his wife after she drowned their kidsI believe there was a victory here - the director was victorious in his encounter with himself. Here, the camera is not anchored to a person. Here, look at how well we understand the importance of location, architecture, place, space, situation. Exposition was not needed at all. That's the hand of a master storyteller in full embrace of his powers.",8,1,1,8 August 2019
Interstellar," Family Movies
","I am starting to think Christopher Nolan is making movies specifically for his family. 'Inception' was a love letter to his wife, and 'Interstellar' is a love letter to his children. You have to pay attention to the secret production names and certain scenes to get the clues but the secret production name of this one was 'Flora's Letter' I believe - the name of one of his daughters. And of course, the story - a father trying to save his children and also get back to them.I can overlook a lot of contrivances if I buy into the main idea and I bought into it - who would not sacrifice their own life to save their loved ones? But there are hundreds more ideas being presented here to consider:<ul><li>The idea that 'time' is not linear, but overlapping</li><li>The idea that time is a function of gravity (which is true, actually)</li><li>The idea that gravity can be used as a technology</li><li>And most importantly, the idea that the universe will move for love</li></ul>This movie has the best movie robots of all time, better than R2D2 even.",9,14,21,28 September 2018
Léon: The Professional," The passage of time illuminates things
","I remember the first time I saw this, a young man in my sophomore year of University. My friends and I marveled at the action, and the lunacy of Gary Oldman.Then I recently sat down to watch it again.There's so many things wrong with this movie. The sexualization of Natalie for one thing, and the insinuation that her father was pimping out all the females in his household, and the 'friendship' she had with the Leon character.Trust me when I say history will not be kind to this one.",1,5,19,24 May 2019
American History X," Preposterous billboard for a buffed up Edward Norton
","There might have been a decent movie in here somewhere, but it was hijacked by Norton in the editing room and turned into a one dimension cartoon.The dialogue here is on the level of street preaching. The characters are completely artificial. The narrative structure is a book report in the form of a voiceover - lazy. Most of the cinematography is in black and white so you can be hit over the head by how 'arty' it is.The narrative hook of the film is a prison sexual assault, the only manner in which Nortons character can be redeemed, apparently. I expect that level of thinking from an 8 year old obsessed with his private parts. If I was a black person I would be highly insulted. An irredeemable racist repents because he equates his prison rape with being black?",1,1,9,30 January 2020
Avengers: Endgame," Episodes
","Color me underwhelmed.I understand why Marvel hired the guys from the Community TeeVee show.Because everything has already been planned and pre-vizzed out for the visual effects shops to work on the CGI, all Marvel needed the directors to do was film the spoken bits in between the cartoon-like action bits. That is the biggest draw back with motion capture - there is no room for tinkering. You're locked into it.This was done with the first two Avenger flicks as well. They needed TeeVee directors because those guys are used to stepping in, do a quick setup, get the shot, and do the job with a minimum of fuss.History grinds away at hacks. Edward Bulwer-Lytton in his day was considered a giant. Now he's a joke, with the annual junk writing contest.What will they say about this in 100 years?",5,4,9,14 November 2019
Batman Begins," The beginning is a delicate time
","Please note, Nolan would correct his mistakes here in the vastly superior The Dark Knight.I caught this in Fairbanks Alaska, when I was up there in 2005 for the summer.There are only two elements that stand out for me here. The first is the radical cutting of the action scenes, at least those involving fights. It appeared they did this for budgetary reasons, but it is consistent with the overall tone of the movie. The Bat moves fast, in the shadows, you won't see him.And the second is the psychotropic notion of facing fear through a hallucinogen.The notion of a secret society proceeding apace with planned destructions of megacities on a regular schedule was interesting, but they didn't fall into the trap of over-explaining everything.",6,1,1,11 September 2018
Saving Private Ryan," The film should have stayed on the beach
","Sometimes, more than a decade later, you revisit a film and it impacts you differently than the first time you saw it.Dunkirk gets a lot right where this movie went wrong. They tried to make it about too much.Movies only have about 2 hours of running time to tell the story. The beginning is crucial, because you're bringing the audience into that world, and it has to be easily understood, because most of us hate exposition, voice over narration, title crawls helpfully explaining things.The first 20 minutes of this movie are about as virtuoso as you can get. A lot of film making techniques had to be used, and in one case invented, to create that sequence. It's effective. It's terrifying. It's exactly how a D Day invasion movie should be. They get it 100% right.The rest of the movie is typical Spielberg aiming for his 8 year old target audience, with cloying sentimentality.The bookends that surround the movie also cheat. In the beginning, as we zoom into the eyes of the old man, it's established this is Hanks - same eye color. At the end, we zoom out of Damons eye and back into the old mans eyes - different eye color. The movie violates its own internal logic. I had a huge argument with my stepfather, an Air Force veteran, about it. He suggested they were going for the 'it's Everyman' idea. I suggested that the director just wanted to have it his own way.The most ridiculous part of the movie is when they tell Upham not to salute the Captain out in the field (because of snipers) yet the Captain has shiny Captain bars on his helmet for the whole word to see. Because we're so stupid we can't possibly see that Tom Hanks is not in command without his shiny Captain bars.",5,2,5,27 December 2019
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A film about destiny
","I went to see this 5 times, I was living in Toms River NJ at the time and the closest theater was at the other end of the state in Princeton, 50 miles away. So I went back once a week to see it 4 more times, that is how much I loved it.
This film has so many meanings on so many levels only the most astute viewer would be able to capture them all on one viewing. Two things stand out for me here:The camera dances. I saw this film before I saw 'Ride With the Devil' and the camera dances there, as well. Lee makes his camera an extra, unseen character, who can go where we can't. Compare this camera to the boring, stationary camera George Lucas liked to use over and over in his prequel trilogies. Now imagine a Star Wars lightsaber fight in the hands of Ang Lee.The other thing is how Lee will let the scenes breathe with nature in the background. A couple of instances come to mind but consider the first main fight scene. Right before the battle starts, Lee cuts to a shot of a tree with the moon behind, and hundreds of bats take flight. That's the eye of a master film maker at work.",10,2,2,9 August 2018
JFK," His glasses had flat lenses
","Watch Costner's face closely. His fake reading glasses have flat lenses. Real glasses, even real reading glasses, have folded lens. The flat lenses are reflecting all the movie making going on in the background. Watch closely.This was done on purpose, because this film was not made to solve any mysteries. This film was made because everyone involved loves filmmaking. This is a movie about movies. It's a masterpiece, because every available tool (at the time) was used: different cameras, different film stocks, different lights, different crews and at least two editors in the editing bay.The film references three realities for us: The day of the event, the manipulation of the day after by the media/government, and the lies we tell ourselves.",9,3,5,12 December 2019
Gone Girl," Strangers
","I usually have to watch Fincher movies a few times before I can formulate my thoughts. His movies are jam packed with information, either verbally or non-verbally or as part of the scene or in the background. He demands your full attention. Yes, even Alien 3 was wonderfully gothic.Let's start with Amy. She comes from a wealthy background. Her mother was the writer of a series of books called 'Amazing Amy' for which Amy is purportedly the inspiration.Her husband is Nick, a lowbrow failed writer from the Midwest.It is insinuated that Amy has a history of being a fake, lying etc. because she's not as Amazing as Amazing Amy and if she's the role model for Amazing Amy, then why isn't she amazing?They've been married five years, they both lose their jobs in the Great Recession of 2008 and move back to the Midwest (in this case, Missouri Ozark land).I'll let others comment on the plot, but needless say 'Gone' is in the title. The case goes nationwide because of the Amazing Amy celebrity angle and a Nancy Grace-ish TV journalist. In desperation, Nick hires a celebrity lawyer who specializes in defending his clients on TV.By the end of the movie, we realize these two winners actually deserve each other - neither one is a sympathetic character.Since the audience already knew she faked her death and Nick was framed, what is the point of the story? I believe the point of the story is that it takes a lot of lies to keep a marriage going. Marriage makes you an unreliable narrator.",8,2,2,1 October 2018
A Quiet Place," Welcome to my life
","I lost my hearing throughout my youth and now wear a cochlear implant, so this movie was a special experience for me. Normally I steer away from any movie with a deaf character because they usually propogate the myth that all deaf people are expert lip readers (and if they're not, somethings wrong). That's a really unfair characterization.Why I think hearing people are amazed with this movie is because they can't imagine a world without sound. I understand, I used to be hearing. It is very easy to take everything for granted when you have perfect physical health and all your abilities.
I liked how the filmmakers totally immersed this movie in a world of silence. They get it. It was authentic.",9,3,5,27 July 2018
Mulholland Drive," Hashtag me too, by way of Occurence at Owl Creek Bridge
","A friend of mine emailed me the other day - wanted my explanation for this movie.I've always thought it was simple enough to understand. A wholesome corn fed midwestern girl goes to Hollywood for fame and fortune and corrupts herself in every which way, then commits suicide. The entire movie is her dying dream.",9,2,3,8 August 2019
Black Hawk Down," Sam as our Shepard
","Ridley long passed the point where he makes movies about the story... somewhere around Black Rain. His movies since then have been about the making of that movie. What you might call self-referential. I call it folding.There's a reason Sam Shepard was cast as the General devising the mission. He's our stand-in for Ridley. Sam himself was a playwright, and as a fringe celebrity himself, hanging alongside the margins of the 1975 Dylan Rolling Thunder tour. Then he got into movies where he's almost always cast as The Man. Watch as Sam 'directs' the proceedings, then has to adjust to things on the fly. This is a movie about making movies.This is the movie making phase where Ridley is into his second wind, the experience of Gladiator and digital cinematography having inspired him. This was so well made, I could not tell the seams of the digital backgrounds until I invested in a top of the line thin screen TV.The movie itself is not intended to explain anything or illuminate anything. It's just a movie.Full disclosure, I attended a college class with one of the Ranger survivors. This was 1996, most Americans had no idea what went down. He told the story of how they were there to help feed those people, and his friend was killed in the battle and his corpse dragged through the street. I'll never forget the sound of his voice as he talked about his friend. It was 100 times more harrowing than any movie I ever saw.",8,1,1,27 December 2019
The Dark Knight," Almost the perfect movie... almost
","I gave a half hearted review of The Dark Knight Rises and explained why, so I figured I should do the counter balance and review the superior film, The Dark Knight.Two things were interesting about this for me:One is how much more of a comic book it is than a film. I counted at least 4 plots among the main story, all interconnected and interweaving. But it's not boring like certain other comic book adaptions can be - this is more like a comic book soap opera. The personal relationships matter.The second thing for me: the handling of noir.Noir is all about how the viewer manipulates the action by viewing. The script is everything here. Wayne has to find out certain information at the same time the viewer does while the Joker is the mastermind, already having set everything up. All anyone else can do is react.The novel trick here is the joker. At two points in the movie, the joker makes a film within a film. He murders innocents, has police routines figured out to a T, has an amazingly complex plan and makes it seem accidental while acting capricious, and pretends not to be amused by the whole thing.",9,1,1,15 August 2018
2001: A Space Odyssey," Hal is a camera eye
","I know it's hard to believe right now, because every other movie has a spaceship in it, but when this first came out, there was nothing else like it. It was a new and unfamiliar world, with serious science fiction notions. So it was a pretty impressive thing, and set the standard for sci-fi even beyond the first Star Wars in '77.I don't believe Kubrick was concerned about the payoff at the end, about the aliens and who made who. I believe he was all about the narrative, and the narrative follows the rule of 3 for who is in control of the story we are watching: the aliens, the humans, or Hal?The aliens? They are apparently capable of folding space and consciousness. The humans can only lumber along in their big spaceship, and their sibling is Hal, an advanced thinking machine. I believe Hal is the author of the story that unfolds before us. This is underscored by his character being represented by a camera eye. That's the essence of Kubrick.",10,1,1,2 April 2020
This Is Spinal Tap," One of the greatest films ever made, despite Rob Reiner being along for the ride
","It's super obvious that all 4 principles are talented musicians, but what they did here is sublime. I mean, how do you outdo Steely Dan? By Writing a song about buttocks called 'Big Bottom', or Sex Farm Woman.
What I love most about the movie is all the dialogue is ab-libbed. So you had to have a sense of your character, who you are making fun of, who your audience is and all of their lines are hysterically funny. The target is low hanging fruit of course, heavy metal music bands.If I had to pick just one movie to watch on a desert island, it would be this one.",10,4,6,7 August 2018
Avatar," A decade later, still great
","I had a chance to revisit this on New Year's Day. What a decade it's been for the movies. In terms of motion capture and the realism of the artificial faces, it's still up there. Nobody has been able to surpass it yet, not even Josh Brolin's Thanos (his was not that bad, actually) and the Cameron produced Alita Battle Angel. That one gets a little degree of separation because the main character was designed to have those huge eyes on purpose. But other than that, what other movie can you name that blew you away?Part of the reason is because one man was in charge. One single mind governed the creation and dynamics of this world, and thus, everything is logically related. Usually with any sort of visual effects movie, the effects work gets farmed out and subcontracted further down all over the world so the work can get done faster and the movie released faster. All that means is countless people are fighting over the soul of the movie, and nothing will tie together.What impresses me here 10 years later?WETA, WETA, WETA. With this one, they went dimensional. The camera is placed in positions that no physical camera could. The camera moves alien in the alien scenes, especially in the beginning when Jake first gets uploaded, and in the flying and battle sequences. The movements of the aliens and creatures inform the movements of the camera.Weaver: she openly acknowledged she is playing Cameron. So Cameron put himself in the movie as the person who is directing the events. It's a nice bit of self reference.The home tree: It's huge and helical and spherical and home to an alien population. When it's brought down, it's downed like the World Trade Centers, right down to the smoke column.What didn't I like? The machine guns. Apparently we are now a space faring civilization that can splice DNA into human-alien hybrids, but we still use Vietnam war era weaponry? The answer is obvious, because tracer rounds still look cool in action scenes.",8,2,3,2 January 2020
The Last Samurai," Racist claptrap
","This was insulting for 3 reasons:1) the Japanese spoken here has been altered for Western audiences. Normal Japanese is spoken completely different from here. Since this movie was made for White Americans. They might as well be speaking Italian here.2) Only a white can save non-whites. See also Dances With Wolves, Avatar3) And the most insulting thing? The main henchman of the bad guy has a port wine stain. This was done obviously for the Western White Audience, because we're so dumb and ignorant that all Asians look the same?",1,59,91,18 December 2019
A Clockwork Orange," The book and the film
","This movie is about watching other movies, and how those movies influence us. Kubrick was never about the writing. He was all about the photography and what's on the screen being presented to you. So consider what is being presented to us:Our on screen surrogates, the droogs, are in costume, constantly performing for each other, with theatrical speech and slang.The rumble with their rivals is on a stage.The rape scene is acted out as another film (they even sing the song for you)There is a non stop focus on the eye - this is meant to be your eye.Here's where it got interesting and meta, and it was already in the book too: the accosted writer is (self-referentially) the writer of the film, who incidentally drives the character to suicide by exposing him to a performance.This is all meant to hit you over the head during the therapy scenes. Alex is forced to watch movies, just as we are forced to watch him watch.Kubrick knows how to handle abstraction. When there is a film in a film, the degree of abstraction has to be the same inside the film, as the film we are watching has with real life.",9,2,3,10 July 2019
Reservoir Dogs," Donnie Brasco did it better
","This is a film about acting - anchored by the undercover cop, played by Roth - with somewhat snappy dialog and a few spartan sets, with a camera moving about to keep it from being completely dull.All the actors involved have done better work in other movies. Tarantino doesn't walk on water, he just copies other movies and folds the timeline into a pretzel to cover his tracks. He also had Harvey to run interference for him.This movie did change Hollywood but only for economical reasons. Blair Witch was much more revolutionary.",4,2,5,23 December 2019
Die Hard," Paradigm Shift
","Movie audiences didn't realize at the time Ferris Bueller was released but it represented a huge paradigm shift. That movie had a lead actor that all but winked at the camera, breaking the 4th wall helpfully explaining things, and taking a perverse pleasure in the joy of conning the other characters.Bruce Willis is everything for this film, and he all but re-invented the modern day blockbuster. I have to give him a lot of credit because the director didn't really go on to distinguish himself. At the time, Arnold and Stallone and Chuck Norris and Steven Seagel, all the action mainstays - they took themselves very seriously. Their movies were rarely about fun.Bruce is all but looking at the camera and saying 'whoopee!'. He comes pretty close with the yippee kay yay line. He makes it fun, and the fun is what we remember the most.This is still holding up pretty well. 'Speed' and all the other derivatives are not.",7,3,3,16 December 2019
Rosemary's Baby," Almost a perfect movie and still terrifying
","This film has aged remarkably well. There's not really much to time stamp this in the way, say that Bullit was, which also came out in 1968. The heart of the story is a gradual realization that all is not as it seems. This kind of story transcends the time and place of the setting.But consider the real life events around this movie. Mia gets into this film rather by accident because Sharon Tate was supposed to play the lead. Mia has an affair with Polanski during it, then gets served a divorce by her husband the singing thug, and finishes the film. She goes to India with the Beatles, Donovan and Beach Boys to meditate, during which John and Paul write thirty songs based on Kabbalah. Inspired in part by Alistar Crowley.That album ends up being the inspiration to Manson to kill Polanski's wife, mistakenly thinking the house was occupied by someone close to the Beach Boys. Lennon takes up with Yoko directly on returning from India. Her interest in the occult leads her to the Dakota, where they keep their home until John is killed.Reading what I just typed, doesn't it make it seem the movie got John killed? It ended up being in the peripheral setting of the events of the Manson murders.",9,4,5,2 March 2020
Inception," I think this might have been a love letter
","I think this entire movie was a love letter from Chris to Emma. I'll try to explain.The most crucial scene in the whole movie is when Leo has to seduct Ellen into the intoxicating dream universe. We're in his mind, and we're in Paris, what appears to be the cafÃ© set from 'Irma la Douce'. I remember reading somewhere in an interview with Chris, he explains that movie is his wife's favorite movie.In the scene mentioned, the environment deconstructs. It doesn't so much as explode as it does unwind the very fabric of space and time, and it penetrates her skin. When she wakes up, she's hooked forever.Try to penetrate the dream layers all the way down to the level of the soul, the very last layer, where Leo constructed an entire metropolis to live in with his wife. A kingdom ruled by the two of them.The bombs, guns and explosions are incidental. This movie is about seduction.",9,1,2,28 May 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," Vanilla
","Another highly ranked 'good, but not great' flick.Every creative choice here seems to reinforce the idea of plainness. The staging, camera work, blocking, acting, set design, plot progression and execution are all plain. This must be the appeal to middle America.As for me, I usually appreciate a little more daring, a little more creativity in my films but it's easy to see why so many families can sit together and watch it every Thanksgiving.Not to be disparaging, sometimes audiences crave a film that is completely without pretense. But I need a little more if you expect me to sit there for 3 hours.",6,3,4,12 March 2020
Halloween," A revisit ahead of the new offering
","I had forgotten just how darn good this movie really is. You have to understand what life was like in 1978. No million channel cable TV package, no internet. No iPhone, no satellite radio. 3 channels on the TV, 4 if you could get good reception for PBS on a clear day. Your own little neighborhood was the entire world.The writers here have crafted this thing skillfully because there was no slasher genre back then, no self-aware characters who would tell the final girl not to go in there.The narrative thrust is simply an unstoppable evil with no real motive. 3 other movies are playing in the background throughout: Psycho, Forbidden Planet and The Thing.The fear is heightened by the notion you are being watched. POV shots that may or may not be from the Shape's POV. The audience watching the movie is forced to see things through the killers eyes.The musical score, also from Carpenter is beautiful in the simplicity - a simple melody that communicates foreboding.The camera work is thrilling, especially when it's handheld.",10,2,3,10 September 2018
The Dark Knight Rises," Lazy cash grab
","The Dark Knight was as close to perfect as a comic book - crime epic flick could get. Starting with Batman Begins, Nolan & team made the right decision to base this version of Batman with plausability.All that hard work in the first 2 movies was thrown out the window. I will give the writers credit for trying to get the script right. The pre production process was very lengthy. Here's what I admired:
The convergence of story, image and music at exactly the right point in the filmThe love story that happens off screen (mirrored by Bane & Talia)The plot device utlizing AlfredWayne getting double crossed that was simple and not needlessly complexBanes minimal costumeNolan understanding less is more (except with Robin)Here's what made me groan:
Robin's unneccessary backstory, complete with the Irish priest at the orphanageBane's raid at the stock exchange using Wayne's fingerprint (the whole world knew that Bane was there, any trading would not have been authorized)Which leads to Wayne losing all his money, being removed from the Board of his company, and handing it over to Talia - too contrived because the end game was the fusion reactor.What really broke the camels back was Banes plan to use the Wayne industry prototypes in the basement for his takeover of Gotham. Anyone who has been around the military knows you would not go into combat with a prototype unit. They cost insane amounts of money to make, break down easily and there are no spare parts. You need a production model with spare parts to go into combat.Half the movie smacks of laziness.",5,3,4,15 August 2018
Iron Man," The Sequels would get it right
","Considering this was the very first one out, that they had no finished script, that there were fights over the budget, that the visual effects had to be scaled back, and the inclusion of Downey was considered as a stunt - it's a testament to Downey and Favreau that the movie got finished as well as it did.But it's still pretty boring and ordinary. The sequels would do better.Gripe #1: The CGI work is pretty static, that is, two dimensional. Pixar and other studios had already released movies where the camera is not bound to any object in the 3 dimensional world. Iron Man 3 would fly way, way beyond this with the help of WETA.Gripe #2: For so much emphasis being placed on the 'science', the science is pretty stiff. Starks home made computer is about as impressive as a cardboard box, and what was that crap about being Summa Cum Laude at MIT? MIT doesn't engage in that kind of foolishness. If you got accepted to MIT, you're already at that level.The science was the one place they could have dazzled us. They decided to play it safe. The third Iron Man movie is the vastly superior one.",5,2,5,27 December 2019
Blade Runner," Manufactured Memories
","This is an amazing movie. Even all these years later, other directors are still staging climatic battles in the rain, in decrepit buildings or on the rooftop. I think Last Action Hero is the most blatant ripoff. Even Batman V Superman had the titular battle in the rain, starting on the roof then proceeding into the decrepit building - at least they reversed it.This movie is about a manufactured being who is unaware he may be manufactured, and that his memories might be fake. So Harrison Ford is a natural for the lead.It's also remarkable for the massive interference foisted on the film by the financiers. Most people, when watching this for the first time, can sense there is something deeper on the surface.Since the story is about events that may or may not be colored, complete with characters who not only make the memories, but make the body parts for other manufactured beings. The implication is noir - an implied narrator who is coloring the world. The studio forced a voice over narration on the film, thus destroying that narrative. Most audiences hate to be hit over the head with exposition, so the film was flop, naturally. The later version would restore the original vision.I consider this the last hurrah of the old school optical visual effects movie. They did everything they could do with the technology of that time, and since the camera can't move, the perspectives are all borrowed from Olson Welles, especially his Macbeth movie. You have to appreciate the artistry, because those are optically composited images. The combination of production design and visual effects was intended to inform you of the world you are visiting - that you didn't need to have anything explained to you.You should see Ridley's 'The Duellists'. There is little to no exposition.",8,1,2,18 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The genius of Kasdan
","When Disney bought Star Wars and announced that they were going to make more movies, 30 years after ROTJ, with the over the hill gang coming back, the question being asked was 'how'?Movies have changed a lot since 1977. When the first Star Wars came out, Lucas screened it for his contemporaries. Guys like Brian dePalma and Francis Ford Coppolla thought it stunk. The camera was stationary and Lucas hadn't attempted anything remotely near what the other guys were doing with their cameras. That wasn't the point. The point was the visual effects breakthrough known as motion control. With motion control, you could film the model spaceships against the blue background with the same track over and over and over because the track was computer controlled. It meant that you could optically composite images together seamlessly because the camera had the same precise track and every single shot. The template for those scenes was a 1930 biplane dogfight movie, the stuff that the younger Lucas gorged himself on as a kid.The following two movies improved and expanded: with Empire, you could now have those spaceships actually move around inside the shot and not be static. When Return of the Jedi, you could do more than 2 spaceships at once. Compare the final space battle in Jedi with the one in the 1977 Star Wars.
So to answer my own question: how?How they did it was to evoke the emotion of the first Star Wars 1977 and overlay the new story on top of it. This is visually referenced in two ways. Way #1: When there is no action and we have our character moments, the camera eye exactly replicates the 1977 Star Wars look and feel. But Way #2, when we have our action scenes (especially space ship stuff) it looks like Pixar movie, the camera eye goes everywhere, bounced up and down, twists and turns, does a somersault and weaves in and out amongst objects.It's an ingenious approach and it is simple: stand on the shoulders of 1977 Star Wars and pretend nothing else existed. The story is about the story, and the story about the story simultaneously. This gives everyone enough room to like it, the hard core Star Wars fans and the kiddies who hadn't even been born yet.Interestingly enough, all this hard work was thrown out the window for Ruin Johnson to make his ridiculous sequel that was about spaceship fuel.To no one's surprise ever, Abrams is being brought back for the third one to correct the course.",7,3,17,7 January 2019
Mad Max: Fury Road," The vagina monologues
","This is a first rate movie with extremely professional production values. Besides that, it's a movie about what it means to be a woman in the world.It just happens to be wrapped up in an action movie blanket.So fellas, if you're keeping up, anatomy is not destiny and try to use the big head more than the little head.",10,2,5,6 December 2019
Gladiator," Ridleys Second Wind
","I've been on something of a Ridley Scott retrospective lately, so I thought I would get around to reviewing this, one of my favorites.Here we have Ridley finally embracing the advantages of digital cinematography.But what's astonishing is that his use of this wasn't as 'in your face' as something like Jurassic Park or Titanic. It is almost all strictly background stuff, handled casually. I dare you to be able to find the digital backgrounds. Although only one shot is obvious (Commodus on the balcony towards the end), most of the visual effects parade by unnoticed. Nothing essential to the core projection: backgrounds, street scenes, facades. Yet all of that is essential to the movie.This film is quite the visual experience. Consider how effortlessly Ridley evoked the world of the romans without any 'Ben-Hur' references. We're immersed in a world that is altogether new and unfamiliar, but we are given absolutely no information/exposition at all. No backstory, no information: just an actor who knows how to drive tension into the next scene.I rate this as one of the great films.",9,2,4,26 December 2019
Goodfellas," Good, but not a great film
","Here we have a master filmmaker who is still finding his way. Reading the other reviews, this comment would probably be considered heresy. But Gangs of New York, Shutter Island and Wolf of Wall Street are all superior films.Martin is still limited here as a director. The camera moves, but tightly bound to the characters. We get the occasional corner ceiling shot, but even the famous tracking shot through the kitchen is tightly behind Liotta. The characters drive this movie, not the camera.Since the characters are driving the movie, they have to be something special. But most of them are psychotic thugs. It's amusing to watch them posture and curse, but lets face it - while you were watching this movie, did you get the feeling your life would be changed or were you just entertained for a few hours?",7,1,2,28 February 2020
