The Blair Witch Project," Dissapointing And Not Scary
","I am a 12 year old movie lover. I first heard of this film on Siskel & Ebert when they talked about the Sundance Film Festival. I really wanted to see it, could it be a movie that finally kept me up at night? The Exorcist couldn't do it but maybe this 'Scary as Hell' movie could. I THINK NOT!!!! It started off so good with the interviews but it got messier ( camera wise) and all that happened was people running around saying 'Oh my god what the F*ck was that'. When all you heard was water dripping and sometimes someone laughing. Oh its such a good idea but its wasted! I really would love to make a movie like this but not screw it up! The ending when Heather and Michael were in the house was confusing. I dont wantt to give the ending away but was it the witch or that guy that killed 7 kids??? I hate how we never got to actually see what was chaseing these people! The acting though is really good, that would be the only really good thing in this movie.",1,0,1,7 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Explosive with action, special effects and excitement!!!!!!!
","I was so excited about this film. Ok so I'm not a die-hard fan of the Star Wars series but still I really like them. Episode 1 is filled ( and I mean filled) with special effects, watch the original Star Wars (before they fixed it up) then watch Episode 1 WHAT A CHANGE!!!!! The original had good effects but WOW for episode 1, it deserves an academy award. For the plot, I had no problems. It is very good for the characters, now what will happen in episode 2? One of the best things in Episode 1 is how when it is over not all the problems are solved, we still have to teach Anakin Skywalker to be a jedi(but we all know that doesn't turn out right). You don't have to be a fan of the movies to understand or like this movie, my friend hadn't seen the other movies and she loved it! The queen has got some pretty cool wardrobe and to John Williams another excellent score.",8,0,0,20 May 1999
The Others," High Quality Film *Spoilers* Keep away if you haven't seen the movie!
","This film gets points right away for being able to scare me. I don't mean something that will keep you awake and thinking like 'Rosemary's Baby' The Others scares as you watch. This is rarely done now adays with success, it has just become too predictible after all the Halloween and Friday the 13th sequels. However, The Others pulls it off.Now to the idea that it is slow...I disagree. The entire film felt intense for me. If you think THIS is slow then you really need to work on your attention span. I am only 14 years old, but I read reviews from people I assume are grown men and women complaining of boredom. That surprises me, shouldn't it be the other way around?The moment in this film that will stay with me is the book of the dead. As Grace (Nicole Kidman) flips through the pages I automatically felt uncomfortable, unsettled. The images will stay with you. Another great moment is when the house is being searched for an 'intruder'. Grace is looking around a room when we notice something behind her, eyes, staring out from the darkness. She does not notice at all and just when it comes apparent to us they are there, a light moves and we discover the eyes are part of a painting. That was perfectly timed, genuine.Now to the ending, I'm talking about the ending-ending when we discover who Grace and the children really are. Well, I guess there was some element of surprise there. Unfortunatly, it didn't seem all the shocking since it isn't a new concept. The line 'This house is ours' seems to come from no where. It wasn't like they loved the house, they were being put through hell. So the ending-ending wasn't the films strongest point. However, when Grace discovers a page that was missing from the book of the dead, that sends chills up your spine. That was frightening.The Others proves that special effects are not needed to scare. It also proves that no matter how many horror movies you have seen (And believe me I have seen LOTS) it is still possible to have a few scares. The Others will take you on a journey that you won't soon forget.",8,0,0,24 August 2001
Moulin Rouge!," Words can't describe it; a (Yes, I'm going to say the 'M' word) MASTERPIECE!
","I'm in awe...............what a movie! Ewan McGregor put it perfectly on the DVD: this movie is a FEAST! Where to begin? It pulls you in, it does not let you go and I loved every minute of it. The film's opening song(Nature Boy) becomes more and more haunting every time I hear it. We move through Turn of the century Paris, but this isn't the upper class were used to. No, we are seeing the other side, the 'poor' side of Paris. However, it is so much more beautiful to see.
It is impossible to pick a favorite scene. There are no stops, and you don't want it to stop. It is the musical I always dreamed of, the musical in your head where none, not-even-the slow ones are boring. It is all enthralling and you can't look away, it is too beautiful. El Tango Roxanne, I remember being blown away when I saw this number in the theater. It is breathtaking! THE ENTIRE FILM IS BREATHTAKING!!! WHAT AN ACHIEVEMENT! WHAT A RIDE! A MASTERPIECE! YES! YES! YES! BANG!(Fade to black, Cue music for Nature Boy)Moulin Rouge......................it is a film about...............love.",10,0,1,25 December 2001
