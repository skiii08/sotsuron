Walk the Line," Best movie we've seen in a long time!
","Having read numerous other rave reviews posted for Walk The Line, I too felt the need to add another to the list. My husband & I heard so many great comments about it just prior to the Oscars that we actually purchased the DVD without having seen it.We were not disappointed! We have watched it twice in the first week! Having grown up seeing John & June on TV and somewhat familiar with their music (although not really big fans) were truly blown away with the performances of Joaquin Phoenix & Reese Witherspoon. As many have written already, these performances seemed so real. They don't look or sound exactly like the originals but truly became them on film with such honest and respectful homage. Joaquin was Cash! Reese was awesome portraying June's devotion for John...the vocals were incredible. As many have also stated - the performances were totally believable & have got us completely hooked on Johnny Cash's story & music (we will be buying the soundtrack very soon!) we will continue to watch this one for many years to come! Amazingly good film - make sure you see it!",10,0,0,10 March 2006
