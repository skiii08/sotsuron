Miracle," Engaging sports docu-drama
","When you think about all the Hollywood actors who never won an Oscar (Cary Grant, for one, although he did get one of those non-specific, gratuitous Academy Awards), Kurt Russell is in very good company. But that probably doesn't relieve the sting of having been overlooked for a Best Actor nomination for his performance in Miracle. A versatile and talented actor who has taken on a wide variety of roles, here Russell delivers a tour de force despite a bad hair piece. It is all the more difficult to portray a non-fictional character and Russell seems to have disappeared into the skin of Herb Brooks. As a coach who assembles a capable but essentially complacent hockey team and then motivates them to win Olympic gold against all odds, Russell excels playing the tough, detached drill instructor/boss whose big heart and emotional connections are carefully kept hidden. It's a tightrope walk to convey these disparate traits and Russell succeeds with subtle body language and control. He embodies the persona of a great coach without hamming it up and should have been recognized at Oscar time.This is not the typical fodder for a sports movie where you see a small town high school team or a group of rag-tag athletes come together for one shining moment, or where one underdog scrapes and bleeds along a path to a major win. Miracle is about much more heady transformations because they are the type of attitude adjustments that last longer than one shining moment. The hockey players of that 1980 team were already tapped for pro careers, their talent already recognized, which made them a much more difficult group to teach and motivate. Most of them thought they already knew how to play & win. The coach realized that he had a bunch of guys content with the glory of merely being on the Olympic team, a glamor item for their resumes that made them more marketable. So the story is really about mentoring greatness spurred by one man's desire to finish a job he started twenty years prior. The process of pushing a large group of already successful athletes to a level of excellence and commitment they didn't know existed is quite marvelous to watch and there are many lessons to be learned from it. My favorite moment in the movie is the shot of Russell, alone in a corridor of the stadium, savoring his team's win, exulting in the validation of his worth and his love for the game, while the players are elsewhere being applauded and photographed. Achievement is always a shared joy with a ripple effect and we see it clearly in this movie and in many ways. This theme is set against a backdrop of the political crises of that decade and the contrast is thought-provoking. How much better could the world be if, instead of presidents and prime ministers, countries were led by people like Coach Brooks? How do you get people to work hard when they don't have to? How do you match up different abilities to build a model of collaborative effort?I would have given this film an even higher rating but thought the directing was sluggish at times and the game sequences were choppy and lacked drama. I also think the writer should have pumped up the dialogue between the players as the feeling of fraternity and horsing around that you would assume occurred is missing. Some subplots could have been shortened in favor of this slant on the group dynamic. But all in all, this is a super movie with great messages that the whole family can enjoy.",7,0,0,16 July 2006
The Prestige," Solid drama lacks suspense
","Methinks Christopher Nolan is letting his personal style get in the way of a good story. Nolan is a very good director, and a good writer on top of that, yet it seems that he has become overly-reliant on his signature use of chronology to make a movie. There are also far too many scenes in which the actors whisper or speak in hushed voices, a device that leads to lost dialog if you're in a packed theater or in a theater that has an incompetent sound system operator.The Prestige is a wonderfully unusual story about the rivalry and deadly history of two magicians at the turn of the century. Entertainment venues were very limited in that era so the attainment of star status was not only lucrative and coveted, it bestowed a good deal of social acceptance when class divisions were well marked. The tension of this rivalry against this backdrop is good fodder for a film, and teamed with complex personalities all around, romance, secrets, a criminal trial, and the dawn of new technological advances should have made a movie of grand entertainment. But, for me, all the suspense was drained and the drama diluted by Nolan's flashback, flash forward technique. Suspense requires time and pacing, a hum that builds slowly to a crescendo that gives you goose bumps or, at the least, makes you feel the hair on your arms. The potential was there, but Nolan interrupted the ascent too many times to gather momentum. Just as I was feeling the gnawing obsession of Angier, I was bumped to a vignette that re-adjusted my focus. And when I became involved with Borden's life, I got bumped to Thomas Edison. Nolan would not allow me to become completely invested in his characters because he simply didn't give me enough quality time with them despite their continuous presence on-screen. There is also one large plot hole that disrupts a major theme of the story.The Prestige has a nearly perfect cast. At this point in his career, Michael Caine has become so ubiquitous that, to me, he is always Michael Caine, a competent actor who overshadows his characters with his familiarity. He should think about changing his accent and/or his hair color if he continues to hire on so frequently. Bale, Jackman, and Bowie are quite the opposite, playing characters new to their resumes and doing so exquisitely. I've come to expect great performances from Bale and Jackman, but Bowie startled me with his acting chops. Scarlet Johanssen, not a favorite of mine as she has been a bland and flat canvas to date, actually shows some dimension in her supporting role.A nicely done drama in which the sum is far less than many of its superior parts.",5,2,10,21 October 2006
Crash," Astonishing
","This is a brave and profound film about racism, class division, and the mistrust that comprises a big piece of modern American society. It is a movie that should start completely new conversations about where we are headed in these three areas and how we can improve the journey.Crash gives us so many ethnic stereotypes without apology that we are forced to acknowledge their sheer honesty. As someone well-known has already said, the reality is that stereotypes exist because they are true. The confounding aspect of stereotyping is that it is one-dimensional. In Crash we see the other underlying textures of human beings and that glimpse of humanity is what moves the story to an enlightening level. There is a rarely seen suggestion that someone who has racist attitudes can also be a decent person and that some minorities do - and some don't - react unreasonably when confronted with a racist jab. There is a depiction of immigrants that runs the gamut from violent to distasteful to wondrous. This refusal to compromise and be politically correct is the cornerstone for the film's heartfelt plea to resolve our differences here in the melting pot that is America. There are also stereotypes of rich and poor and in-between and the frustrations of all of them as they try to grasp some measure of contentment in their lives while dealing with societal and bureaucratic structures.The theme of mistrust is so thick you can taste it. No one trusts anyone, not husbands & wives, not business partners, not cop partners, not fathers & daughters, not mothers & sons, not between thieves, and least of all between different cultures. However, the movie doesn't merely show us the mistrust, it also shows us why we mistrust. Emotional connections are formed between unlikely characters, some who may never see each other again, which enhances the feeling of hope that is the glinty residue of this film. One of the many stunners of this story is that nearly every character was so wrong about something essential in their lives and this serves, whether consciously or subconsciously, as a jolt for the audience. It shows us big flaws across the board and is an impetus for self-examination. The casting of the film is pure genius in itself. Haggis avoided paparazzi-grade stars and used a mix of familiar and unfamiliar faces anchored by the powerful talent of Don Cheadle. Each and every actor, from major-to-supporting-to-bit-parts, delivered an amazing performance. How Haggis did this with such a large ensemble boggles the mind and combined with the overall direction, editing, and an engrossing script that is full of surprises, should indeed guarantee an Oscar - not just one, but in all these categories.Crash is a cinematic milestone and breathtaking to behold. Don't miss it.",10,2,8,9 February 2006
The Bourne Identity," Engrossing, intelligent, and worth buying
","The Bourne Identity, besides being film entertainment of the highest order, enjoys two unexpected accomplishments. One is that it positions Matt Damon as a truly multi-dimensional actor with a creative range usually found in actors raised in classical theater. The second accomplishment is that it has delivered a rather peerless model of what a spy/action movie should look like.I have rented this movie three times over the years, and continue to marvel at Damon's performance. Granted he has an excellent script, and Ludlum's story is gripping, but Damon hits so many high notes in his characterization of Jason Bourne that the viewer can't help but become emotionally involved with him. We feel his frustration, his helplessness, his confusion, his meanness, and his resolve. Most importantly we feel his burning intelligence grappling with the amnesia that may get him killed and we find exhilaration in his physical and mental strength.Tony Gilroy's script and Doug Liman's direction are both masterful. Everything is believable from the hi-tech toys to the car chase to the fight scenes to the relationships between various characters to the plot development. There are very few visual gimmicks to propel the story and yet the pace never lets up. I found myself wondering what I would say and do in many of the situations and that means the movie drew me in, that I wasn't merely a passive observer. Dialog was real, the subplots were efficient and well-placed, the props and locations added wonderful flavor, and the reliefs were perfectly timed. The cast surrounding Damon is a delicious smorgasbord of 'types,' with Brian Cox being the only usual suspect in these kinds of roles.While Ludlum is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to good story telling, the way Damon, Gilroy and Liman brought it to life on screen is quite remarkable. I fully intend to purchase the entire Bourne series if the follow-ups are as good as this first effort. This initial film is worth multiple viewings and deserves a permanent place in anyone's film library.",9,0,1,23 January 2006
Disturbia," Disturbingly careless rip-off of a film classic
","D.J. Caruso's short attention span appears to be better suited for directing TV shows, or maybe commercials, rather than full length feature films. Disturbia, his latest effort, suffers from disjointed plotting, flimsy character development, and bad timing. Suspense, which is what this movie is supposed to be all about, is always interrupted by some unimportant tangent the director feels obliged to show us. As a result, we get little jolts of surprise instead of the throbbing sense of dread that echoes with an audience after a film ends.As a teen fright film, Disturbia could achieve a respectable 6-out-of-10 score but it would need more blood and guts for a higher rating in that category. As quality entertainment for a mature audience, the movie fails in most ways. The inevitable comparisons to Hitchcock's Rear Window, absurd as they are, automatically raise the bar and show Caruso's creative limitations, lack of imagination, and complete inability to affect more savvy film buffs.The silly, slurping dazed-and-confoozed Asian buddy, the teasey-cheezy girl next door, the continually absent and oblivious mother, the portrayal of cops as ignorant, and an experienced and treacherous killer who gets had by a teenager are the mundane hallmarks of Caruso's sophomoric re-creation of a film classic. Shame on him.",2,9,16,21 August 2007
The Men Who Stare at Goats," The Un-Movie?
","This is an odd little movie. There are odd characters who have odd experiences in odd locations, all revolving around an odd topic. Whether this collective montage is deserving of being committed to film is questionable because the central topic cannot be explored in any substantial, relevant way for an audience.O.k., so the military has done some research on alternative weaponry, namely psychic ability. And, o.k., there are people who have more evolved psychic powers. And, hey, wouldn't it be great if there was a way to harness psychic energy to fight a war? It sure would be a way to reduce the defense budget and it might be more humane. It might even be a way to end acts of war since our enemies wouldn't be quite sure how much we know of their plans or of the extent of our destructive potential.But this movie is not science fiction; you are not asked to suspend belief. It's about an idea whose time has not yet come. Like cars that fly or transporters that reassemble atoms from one place to another. The funny part of the story is when this idea is given some serious attention by the military which has to appoint some unusual personality types to implement the research. The serious side of the story is the goal - war games. In between is the whack-a-do vocabulary of the characters, all New Age, Jedi, mind expanding phrases and notions. The tragedy of war is obvious; the comedy of war is much more difficult to portray even though TV's MASH and Hogan's Heroes did it. Goats doesn't do either very well simply because there is no sequence of dramatic events to hang the story on, no matter how hard the film makers try. In the end, Goats is not comedy, drama, sci-fi, thriller, action movie, etc. It's a cork board with some random facts push-pinned to it. But I have to give this film 5 stars because of the earnestness of the actors, screenwriter, director and supporting crew who try to make it into something.",5,0,1,16 May 2010
Pi," Arrogant and tedious
","Pi is a perfect example of the hubris of youth and the embodiment of the young film maker who fancies himself an *artiste* but, alas, has nothing to say. Here, the real artistry of the film maker is that he was able to get together some money to shoot the movie and then get it distributed.The impudence of the movie, just like a pubescent teenager, is that it likes to ask age-old questions for which there are no answers. The arrogance of the film is that the director/writer seems to plainly say to the audience 'Look at what important and complex things I think about and, if you like this movie, then you're smart, too.' The intellectual topics that begin the story are meant to impress the audience with the notion that the film maker is a deep thinker. But when nothing comes of anything, when dialog is scanty, when lengthy empty scenes prove pointless, what the audience is left with is just deeply harsh cinematography that is brutal on the eyes. But, oh wait, this must be some artistic manifestation of the protagonist's childhood trauma. The very use of a stark but grainy black and white medium adds to the pretense of this project. Here we have a director, completely drunk on his mighty cinematic vision, taking a beautiful spark of an idea and turning it into road kill. I was relieved that scenes of Jackson Pollock-type visuals were not used to depict the protagonist's growing mental anguish, though this may have used up time better than the bugs and brain...but, oh, wait, these were artistic metaphors! In this movie, genius-as-a-tortured-soul comes off as unsympathetic, unlikeable, non-productive, unhygienic, anti-social, and creepy. While, indeed, there may be big brains who are like this, it does not make for an enjoyable movie experience unless it is put into some kind of central plot construct. To have three less than half-baked plots doesn't count.If you want to see stories built around math theories, I suggest you watch the CBS TV show Numb3rs. Pi may have been a catalyst of some kind for this show, but, believe it or not, TV does it better. Only one star for an original idea for a film that, unfortunately, ended up as pie in the eye.",1,10,19,21 January 2006
The Dark Knight," Solid Teen Film
","This is one of those films teenagers can see and then feel like they've seen a meaningful movie with great action scenes and grown-up themes, a movie that seems to present deep moral philosophies and it has the additional benefit of a cast that has real acting credentials. All in all, I suspect teens will rave about this movie as one of the best of all time.In reality, TDK shows what Christopher Nolan can - and can't - do with a big budget. He wallows in his own zeitgeist, stuck in the quicksand of his creativity and unable to hone & polish a slush fund of ideas and concepts about explosions, car chases, the rantings of a killer called The Joker, and the fortitude of a hero called Batman. The movie drags on and on and on looking for its core, but never finds it. Ultimately, all it finds are the excuses it needs for the special effects.Heath Ledger's performance is outstanding, but then his character is the only one in the film that has much of anything to say and, since he's a caricature, he can ham it up to his heart's desire. Character development is not high on the priority list. The supposed romance between plain-faced boring Rachel and Batman is like a red herring, serving what purpose I could not see. But then, plot development isn't a high priority for this story, either. There is a weak attempt to bring a mob crime boss into the plot as an accomplice to The Joker, and an even weaker sub-plot about moving money to Asia, but all of this is treated so superficially you can see how Nolan just doesn't have the artist's discipline to edit out unnecessary footage. He thinks *everything* he writes and films is important, forgetting that the mature audience is not looking for a ride on his ego trip.TDK has the look of a storyboard or perhaps a comic: blocks of scenes, dialogue, and graphics. It lacks the fluidity of true drama that is paced with suspense and emotional connections between characters. It lacks the wit that is absolutely necessary to make a fantasy entertaining and involving. It is overwrought, overlong, and bloated by its self-importance. But because it's Batman on a big budget and has little competition and critics are starved for something to praise, it will sell.",4,9,21,13 December 2008
The Descent," Disappointing
","Neil Marshall certainly knows how to scare us but The Descent is a disappointing encore from the creative mind that gave us Dog Soldiers. While Dog Soldiers was smart, funny, suspenseful and as realistic as a horror movie can be, The Descent is simply a gore fest strewn with contrivances to make us jump in our seats. Are you afraid of the dark? Are you afraid of heights? Are you afraid of being trapped with no way out? Are you claustrophobic? Does a woman stand a chance against a wild beast? Are you afraid of fear? On and on it goes, a continuous sophomoric thread of various frights choreographed to jolt the audience, like a Halloween house of horror built by high school students. There is no real suspense, just the edginess from wondering when the next Thing will jump out of the shadows.Marshall does a fine job getting the most from his cast and the pacing of the film is just right. He also gives us the originality of 6 very strong female characters without painting them as caricatures or as social aberrations and this deserves high praise. There are many indications of Marshall's talent for bringing fresh ideas to the big screen and his ingenuity as a filmmaker. However, the bottom line is that the weak plot and lack of character development pretty much dead-ends any emotional involvement in this story. What we're left with is an amusement park ride that lasts for about 90 minutes and, sadly, this alone will sell movie tickets and DVD rentals. Marshall has far more potential than this and I hope he can stay hungry enough to develop it.",3,0,2,11 January 2007
The Da Vinci Code," Could have been worse, should have been better
","I read the book and enjoyed the twists and turns and puzzle-solving and it's unique premise, so I was very much looking forward to seeing it on the big screen. This is a good movie, but not the great one it could have been.Though Ron Howard kept the story moving and I didn't get antsy in my seat, I wondered afterward what the film would have looked like in the hands of another director. A director who can build suspense was needed for this film and that isn't Howard's strong suit. Howard and the screen writer did a good job of providing all the information and background necessary to understand a rather esoteric topic, but some of that information turned out to be dead weight when made part of the movie. Meanwhile, other information that should have been included was not. For example, Langdon's fear of small enclosed spaces really did not add to the movie and, in the book, Sophie was portrayed as more intellectual than she came across in the film. A romantic relationship between Langdon and Sophie began to develop in the book, but you don't see it in the movie.Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon was somewhat of a misfire. In an obvious effort to appear professorial, we don't see a range of emotions in Hanks' characterization of Langdon. The book makes Langdon a man who is unwillingly swept into a murder conspiracy but who is equally impelled by his own expertise and resourcefulness. We don't see his struggles with the fear of being hunted and the frustration of figuring out his next move, and then his decoding talents come out of the blue at just the right time. Tatou does a very good job with what she's given, but the book's Sophie was shrewd and dynamic and Tatou isn't allowed to show these traits except briefly in the opening scenes. She devolves into a rather passive partner for most of the movie. Unnecessary minutes were given to Silas, whose perverse dedication to a religious philosophy could have been summed up more quickly without the short voyages to his childhood. Getting to know Silas detracted from the terror we are supposed to feel when confronted by him. Instead, we feel sorry for him most of the time and that interferes with the thrill of the chase-and-escape rhythm we should be experiencing throughout the film. Jean Reno is always the perfect French cop, but again, the dichotomy of his character is lost in the film whereas, in the book, the reader wonders if he's the 'Teacher.' Because of the time constraints of a movie, it would have made more sense to modify Fache because he never becomes suspicious in the way the author intended. McKellen is superb in his role as Teabing, stealing every scene he's in. My guess is Howard didn't direct him at all and just let him roll.My rating of 6 out of 10 is slightly higher than my gut tells me because Howard and the screen writer were faced with the daunting task of not only bringing a record-breaking best seller to the screen, they had the additional burden of translating a big, complex subject full of conjecture, over-the-top characters, secret rituals, ancient histories, symbolism, and religious factions. Add to this that all the clues related to the central murder are in Mensa-type codes and you can imagine their priority was to make this story understandable to a mass audience who has not read the book. This earnestness, however, is what diluted the suspense and, ironically, left several unanswered questions. So, I keep wondering what Spielberg, who can build suspense, awe, and excitement in the span of only a few frames, would have done with a story like this.",6,2,5,19 May 2006
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," A fair cartoon, a mediocre movie
","I am willing to suspend disbelief for many stories just to enjoy them as sheer entertainment, but this movie fails miserably on delivering anything resembling an enjoyable film experience other than watching the leads interact and wondering in what stage their affair was when the scene was shot. There are actually two movies here, both incomplete and lacking creative twists, and the action-movie is completely unbelievable to boot. The studio execs must have been jumping for joy when the Brangelina romance hit the tabloids because this movie may have otherwise passed into oblivion without much ado. Brad has already had a few duds and needed a career boost to retain his bankable reputation. I am astounded by professional critics who gave this film 3-stars-out-of-4!! The plot has so many holes I could write a thesis on the many ways the story insults its audience with its stupidity. I'm also tired of seeing a hero survive a battle with nary a wound against a battalion of shooters armed with unlimited weapons and bullet-proof armor while the hero merely stands in the open in shirtsleeves and a Kevlar vest, swinging his arms around returning fire. How did 30 or 40 trained assassins miss - at the least - blowing out Brad's kneecaps? Another annoyance was the mumbled dialog in many scenes, but since there wasn't much of a plot, this ultimately did not matter. 'True Lies' did a far superior job in this genre.Maybe some talented writer will take the first half of this movie and develop it into the story it could have been. The second half has already been done, re-done, and overdone, except this one has no ending. My 2 stars are for the production values and the score.",2,1,3,27 December 2005
The Departed," Scorsese's Worst?
","Yeah, Scorsese should have an Oscar or two on his fireplace mantle, but surely not for this. The testosterone-fueled screenplay is boringly predictable, the hollow dialog is just a bunch of rants strung together, and the plot is treated so superficially as to be an insult to our intelligence. The sub-plots are the inventions of a fool with no imagination. In total, the story is unadulterated drivel, not even worthy of B-movie status.Without the fantastic cast assembled for this film, and without Scorsese's masterful hand to erect a visually exciting film experience, The Departed would have ended up going straight to video. Maybe it should have anyway. In terms of film history, it's a dirty shame Scorsese got his statuette for this shallow piece of nonsense.",1,2,6,21 April 2007
Man on Fire," Hot turns to cold
","I can't imagine what director Tony Scott was thinking when he shot this film. He took a wonderful cast and put them on the 'crush' setting of a blender and came up with a concoction of so many flavors, you don't know what it is. Man on Fire went down in flames for me. First of all, is Mexico City the completely lawless, politically corrupt city it is portrayed as in this story? My goodness, remind me never to go there. Then there is the revenge-religion-redemption-martyr plot which ricochets around the viewer's head ad nauseum so that you don't know what to think or feel from one scene to another. Add to this other plot lines of a Mexican mob that kidnaps children for money, rampant greed, and parental dysfunction. Then top it all off with gyrating camera-work, sporadic & strange subtitles, plot holes, and supporting characters who seem not really part of the story but exist only to accomplish certain tasks needed by the main character.I haven't read the book, but I think Denzel's character was supposed to be a really bad guy whom I shouldn't have liked, or at least been wary of. Well, I did like him which turned everything that happened inside-out and it made the ending illogical and sad. Are you supposed to feel sad at the end of a so-called 'action' movie? Are you supposed to feel glad or puzzled by a suicide? Are you supposed to feel a grinding in your ears when a movie shifts gears? When a movie devolves from engaging to annoying to consternation to distaste, it's just not working.Denzel is in usual excellent form as is the rest of the cast all the way down to the most minor roles. But the direction, the musical score, and the overall tonality of the movie is a mess. It's a good example of how actors sign on for what appears to be a quality project and then are completely at the mercy of a director who is having a profound creative breakdown. Four stars for the incredible cast and a great beginning of a story that takes too long to ultimately grow cold.",4,1,2,4 February 2006
