Hereditary," Very refreshing supernatural film!
","Let me just start by saying, I could see why someone would maybe dislike the movie. It's a slow burn, and the second half of the movie is not quite as good as the first, and does get a bit generic (although I thought the ending was pretty damn good honestly. I really don't see what the problem is here.). If you're going in expecting something like the conjuring chocked full of cheap jump scares, you are definitely watching the wrong film.I feel this movie probably isn't meant to be seen in theatres. Instead, try watching it in a dark room on a good tv with a good sound system (if possible) either by yourself or with a few friends. I honestly feel that this is one of the best supernatural films to come out in a long time. Although some may argue it's a bit contrived, it still feels fresh and is very well executed, and it DECIMATES the other recycled new age paranormal filth that's been shoved down our throats for so long (The Conjuring, The Nun, Annabelle, Insidious). I think anyone who is a true fan of the horror genre will enjoy it, or at the very least appreciate it.",9,0,1,2 January 2019
