First Man," Audibly Beautiful
","I read that beyond telling the story of the moon landing, First Man was intended to be a love letter to aerospace and aeronautics, and to be authentic to the experience of the astronauts. I don't know how close they achieved that, but this movie truly makes you feel painfully anxious with unnerving sounds of creaking and rattling metal, what one can only imagine came with the experience of early space travel.Backing the man-made sounds of sending a tin can into space, Justin Hurwitz's beautiful soundtrack mixes excitement and anticipation with exploration and a sense space's soundless void-if that makes sense. I could write equally about the effect the soundtrack had to the cinematography. It's a wonderful movie made amazing by the sounds and music that are laced throughout it",8,0,1,6 September 2019
