Blade Runner 2049," Disappointing... but still worth seeing
","This film had so much potential. It has great acting, wonderful and innovative special effects, lavish and imaginative environments, unique science fiction elements, it feels realistic, the music and tone are spot on, the cinematography is the kind you can watch for days... they only forgot story, and unfortunately that's kind of important. I was secretly hoping that they would have gone back to the source material, the original source material: the novel 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.' The themes explored in that book are compelling and fascinating and include morality, religion, and what it means to be human. The original 'Blade Runner' adopted some of these themes. This film abandons them. Because of that, it feels soulless, nothing but a pantomime of the original.I think that the primary plot failing is that 'Blade Runner 2049' lays itself bare. We know right from the start who is a replicant and who is human. This strips out the heart of what (to me) makes Blade Runner special: the questioning of what it actually means to be human and the juxtaposition of humans acting like androids and androids acting with selfless humanity. Very little of that is to be found in this film.Walking out, I was left scratching my head at what themes they actually were trying to get at here. None are readily apparent. So it ends up being a cool looking, atmospheric action/sci-fi flick. That's makes it a good movie, but doesn't make it a 'masterpiece.'People still talk about the original 'Blade Runner,' 30 years after it's release. Nobody will be talking about this movie when the year 2049 actually rolls around.",7,24,49,28 October 2017
Wind River," Good film, but flawed
","Overall, I enjoyed this film. I liked the story, the interesting wilderness settings, the Native American angle, and the themes. They did a great job of portraying a bleak and hostile land. And Jeremy Renner puts in a solid performance in a kind of role he's accustomed to, but also quite effective in. He pretty much carries this film.The moment things first started to slip for me was with the appearance of Elizabeth Olsen. My first thought was 'oh no, not that silly Avengers girl.' I think I get why Olsen was put into this role - she's supposed to be a 'fish out of water.' But completely miscasting someone is not quite the same thing as having a good actor portray being out of their element. It's kind of like a short cut to the end and it doesn't work. I didn't find her performance believable (or good). I see this is a Weinstein produced film and will just leave it at that... The other main thing that bothered me about the film was the inconsistency with the winter shots. While film production in winter is extremely difficult, I felt that some of the issues were preventable. It doesn't actually go from complete overcast and a blizzard to blue sky, calm and sunny in 10 minutes anywhere that I know of on earth. And when it's actually cold out, you can see people's breath. See 'Fargo' as an example of a film that pulls off winter production well.Despite these things, this remains one of the better films I've seen this year.",7,0,3,25 November 2017
Passengers," Mediocre, Cliché, Sci-fi
","This is how big Hollywood studios do science fiction. They dumb it down, water it down, add big name star power, add some explosions and action, add some cheesy romance, add a mandatory sex scene, and turn it into inoffensive pabulum for the masses. In fact, I have trouble even calling this move science fiction since there is so very 'science' involved. Grade school level astronomy students should be capable of laughing at this movie, but the real problem is that it's more of a cheesy romantic comedy than sci-fi. The bulk of the movie is dedicated to following the evolution of the romantic relationship between the two main characters. This choice means that a lot of the actually interesting things that could have explored - such as moral dilemmas, the effects of extreme isolation, the fragility of humanity in the face of space - were all shuffled to the back-burner. After the movie expends itself on the romance story, a cliché filled action sequence wraps it up in a neat little package, and the ending ties it up with a bow. In summary, it's a visually interesting romance story stuffed into a sci-fi package. I suppose if I was looking for a romance story involving Jennifer Lawrence, I'd be all over it. But I wanted a science fiction movie. I feel a bit duped. A generous 5/10.",5,3,6,19 March 2017
"I, Tonya"," Average Film, Nothing Special
","I felt compelled to write a quick review based on the number of glowing 10/10 reviews I'm seeing on here. Maybe everything is 10/10 now, and that's just the times we live in, but for me a 10 is a masterpiece of film, a seminal film. 'I, Tonya' is nowhere close to that. I found it to be an enjoyable bit of nostalgia that was sadly a bit lacking in emotional impact. I personally disliked the fake-documentary style of the film, and found that this had the opposite of it's intended effect: it took me out of the film and made it seem more fake. It reminded me I was watching a film recreation of actual events, instead of being able to just enjoy the story for what it was.About 3/4 way through the film I started to lose interest. I knew where it was going to go and there were no surprises. If you are interested in the Tonya Harding story and pine for some 90's nostalgia (which I thought could have been emphasized more), then I would recommend this film to you, but sorry folks, 'I, Tonya' is not the second coming of 'The Godfather.'",6,1,2,28 March 2018
Dunkirk," The Best Film of 2017?
","As the year 2017 draws nearer to a close, I find myself looking back on the year that was in film. Two things stand out to me. One, it was very mediocre year for film. Hollywood is increasingly churning out 'pabulum for the masses' in the way of high grossing superhero movies (I guess you can't fully blame them if that's all people want to see). And two, 'Dunkrirk' stands out as one of the most memorable film experiences of the year. I suppose seeing it in full IMAX helps in that regard (and you really missed out if you waited for DVD on this one). But more than that, 'Dunkirk' stands out because it completed bucks the trend. In a day of CGI and blue screens, Nolan shot it all in old-school film. In a day where most people would have expected this film to be about gore and epic battles, Nolan went micro, focusing instead on a few individual stories, carefully interwoven, taken out of the overall battle for Dunkirk. And in a day where films are typically comprised of jump- cut editing, Nolan gives us long pans down beaches and along rows of men. It's not a perfect film, and I think there's a certain level of 'fanboyism' at play here in some of the reviews. I greatly disliked the loud and jarring soundtrack. Some of the acting was just OK, and Nolan completely failed to capture some of the historic realities of what actually occurred there. Notably, I don't think the true scope of the hundreds of thousands of men and thousands of pieces of equipment was captured. But then you have to go back to the point about either making a 'film' or a 'CGI-fest.' Given that choice, I will gladly accept the former for what it is. Barring some hidden gems I've overlooked, this will probably land in the #1 spot on my end of year list.",8,1,9,25 November 2017
Duck You Sucker," Glimpses of something, but ultimately a mess...
","I read that Leone only made 'Duck, You Sucker' because he couldn't make what he really wanted to do ('Once Upon a Time in America') due to various issues with funding and rights to the material. I don't think his heart was really in this one. The film lacks the careful craftsmanship that his other films have. Perhaps there is a diamond in here somewhere, something that others are seeing, but it wasn't polished enough to be clear to me. The best Leone films are very deliberate. Almost nothing is wasted, every shot and scene has a purpose and every shot looks like a professional photograph. I cannot say the same about 'Duck, You Sucker.' The filmmaking here seems a bit tired. A lot of effort was obviously put into special effects and explosions, and I think that dragged down the rest. Call it the 'George Lucas Effect.' I had no idea Leone pioneered that too. What makes the other Sergio Leone films special to me is that they are in many ways 'films about films.' They offer a stylized look into American culture from a very European perspective. If that's present here in 'Duck, you Sucker,' it went over my head.",5,4,12,3 June 2018
The Favourite," Not for everyone, and that's the point
","Yorgos Lanthimos is a director that loves to challenge his viewers. He uses a variety of subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) film-making and story-telling techniques that assist him in punching up the story he is trying to tell. The viewer will likely fall into one of two camps: people that are interested in the art of filmmaking enough to pick up on, appreciate, and understand these techniques, and people that just wanted to watch a movie and not be subjected to subtle psychological prodding.You can see this division play out in these reviews, with most people either highly praising the film, or saying it was boring, a waste of time, unsettling, disturbing, and nonsensical. The funny thing is that the critics are not entirely wrong with these labels - the film actually is at times unsettling, disturbing, and nonsensical, and intentionally so. This is trademark Lanthimos.The classic example of one of Lanthimos' techniques, and something of his own trademark prior to this film, was the way characters in his films would speak in clipped, unnatural ways to keep the viewer off balance. Thankfully he has dropped that from this film, as I feel it was starting to hold him back a little. But he has included in its place a wide variety of interesting camera angles, lenses, lighting (such as intentional bad lighting, with faces darkened, something you rarely see), a soundtrack that transitions from pleasant to jarring and back, and anachronisms thrown in (Intentionally I believe).Where I diverge strongly from the critics is that I found this film to be highly compelling and not boring in the slightest. The acting was absolutely superb, with Emma Stone in particular knocking it out of the park. The interplay between the three female lead characters was fascinating. The historical context created by the sets and scenery were mind blowing and I wish I could have seen this on the big screen to really appreciate it. And the aforementioned techniques kept me on the edge of my seat and guessing at what would come next throughout.",9,3,5,28 April 2019
Mr. Nobody," Pseudo-scientific Pabulum
","There is a concept in food where something if something that is supposed to be sweet is made too sweet, it becomes 'cloyingly sweet' and is ruined. That is how I would describe 'Mr. Nobody' - a cloyingly sweet film that abandons any notions of realism, science, or logic in favour of an outpouring of style and sweetness. It's one of those films that seems high-minded and intellectual, but there is really nothing there behind it, at least nothing that I found. I found it a bit nauseating to watch the overly sappy romances, with overly sappy love music overlaid, and overly stylistic camera angles applied... as I said, 'cloying.' The jump-cut style of the editing is also quite annoying and the jumping around in time grows tiresome extremely quickly. The logic holes in the plot quickly become apparent but the film slaps on more sap to cover them up. Part of the problem is that I came to this film as a recommended 'science-fiction,' but I can assure the reader that there is nothing scientific in the slightest about it. I see the IMDB tag does read 'Fantasy Romance' and that is how I would accurately describe the film.",2,4,9,8 September 2018
Logan," Not bad for a superhero film
","I usually can't stand modern superhero films, the only exception being parts of Nolan's Batman series. But the mood of the first half of 'Logan' is quite reminiscent of Nolan's work, as it brings a realism and humanity to these familiar, fantastic characters. There's something fascinating about an old, broken down Wolverine limping around half-drunk. Maybe I'm strange, but I almost wish the entire movie was just like the beginning: documenting the uninspiring life of washed up superheros. However, they just couldn't help themselves and the film's final act devolves into the typical kind of nonsense I've come to expect from Marvel movies. It almost seems like a different film at the end from the one that started.I can't help but feel this was a missed opportunity to make a true statement and break the mould of superhero movies (a rare thing indeed in today's world of movies by corporate committee). While 'Logan' is entertaining and certainly worth watching, I was reminded of the 2016 film 'Midnight Special,' which also features a strange young child on the run, and perhaps does a better job of it.",7,4,8,26 August 2017
Once Upon a Time in America," You can't blame the cutting anymore...
","Is 'Once Upon a Time in America' praised because of what it is, or because of who made it? I would argue that it is the latter, as Sergio Leone has been raised to a mythical status due to his unique directing talents and the success of the four western films he directed. Despite what Leone brought to this film (and his signature techniques are all at work here), that alone does not make a great film, and unfortunately 'Once Upon a Time in America' suffers from several key shortcomings. The main one of these shortcomings is simply the plot, which is too cumbersome, and once put through the wringer of the pacing and time-jumping, simply doesn't hold up as interesting enough to justify the 4 hour runtime of the extended version (the version Leone intended, apparently). By the end of the film I was deflated and bored, and the ending itself did nothing to change that. There was a gem of a good story in here - Leone knew that - but I don't think he succeeded in bringing it out. And many of the scenes seemed to be there only to provide shock value. Leone's earlier work was much 'tighter,' where every shot seemed to matter.The music and soundtrack are also a bit jarring. I think this was Leone's weak spot through most of his films. His repetition of musical themes in a film worked OK for his westerns, but in this film in particular, it becomes wearisome to hear the same cloying theme for the 50th time over 4 hours. I found myself distracted by the music and wishing it wasn't there behind the dialogue much of the time. So despite some glimmers of brilliance, even the fully restored version of 'Once Upon a Time in America' rings flat for me. Due to the years of delays in getting this film off the ground, he missed his window and the 'gangster' genre was already tired when this film came out (and arguably it's even more tired today). And unlike his westerns, which were sort of meta-films as they came after the hay-day of the format. 'Once Upon a Time in America' just feels like one of the pack.",5,2,6,5 June 2018
Three Colors: Blue," Does not live up to the hype
","This film is a critical darling - a favourite of many notable film critics, including perhaps most famously Roger Ebert. But after watching it, I can't quite see what all the fuss is about. Seems a bit like an 'Emperor with no clothes' situation where one must praise the film lest they not be allowed in the esteemed halls of the famous critics. To me, 'Bleu' is objectively not a very good film. The story is not that interesting, the characters are not that likable, the cinematography has its moments, but mostly the film has a dull look, and the music quite bad actually considering the importance of music to the plot. You look at your watch and keep going, thinking that it must get good at some point to justify all this lavish praise. But it never does.I think what is appealing to the critics and people who love this flim is that it is rich in symbolism and metaphors. Everything means something else. From reading Roger Ebert's gushing review, apparently there is even some 'meta' symbolism at play in the larger scheme of the three film 'Three Colors' trilogy. As clever as all this is, it didn't actually help me enjoy watching it any more than I did. The color blue motif that runs through the film comes across more hammy than clever.My partner remarked 'well, that was a waste of time' after the film ended, and I can't help but feel the same way, even though I usually enjoy challenging films. C'est la vie, but consider yourself warned.",5,0,0,11 May 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Dervitive Trash
","I cannot understand at all where the hype for this film is coming from. There is absolutely nothing in this film that has not been done better elsewhere. There is no reason for this film to exist, as far as I'm concerned. The style is seems to riff on Wes Anderson, to the point where he should probably be asking for a royalty. Except it comes across as a 'poor man's' version of it.And there is a Disney war propaganda cartoon made in 1943 called 'Der Fuehrer's Face' that captures the exact same essence of 'JoJo Rabbit' - the absurdity of the Nazi beliefs and Hitler as the buffoon - and does a better job of it. Not many people nowadays have seen that old short, but 'JoJo Rabbit' basically rips it off (particularly the 'Heil Hitler' gags). I enjoyed that short cartoon far more then I enjoyed JoJo Rabbit and recommend you check it out.I could perhaps forgive the derivative nature of the film if it was actually clever or funny, but it is neither. The humour is all one-note low brow slapstick. And there is a confusing juxtaposition at play between absurd and completely unrealistic comedy while ALSO trying to insert entirely serious (and old as dirt) messages about war and fascism. The two work together like oil and water.I am coming to the conclusion that the only reason this film got so much attention from the Academy Awards was that it was this years 'woke' choice - a film where the message trumps the filmmaking. Not recommended at all.",3,5,12,15 February 2020
Midway," Disappointing, reminds me of 'Pearl Harbor'
","For me, 'Midway' is a frustrating film because the source material has so much potential but what we get is so lackluster in comparison. In many ways, I am reminded of the (awful) 2001 'Pearl Harbor' film, which was over-expository and spent far too much time creating and following around flimsy 1-dimensional characters that the viewer is supposed to care about (but really, we don't) in a series of tear-jerking moments as opposed to really telling the story of what happened that day. And despite the obvious lesson there, 'Midway' inexplicably goes down the exact same path.There is a youtube video by a user called 'montemayor' that explains the battle for Midway from a strategic point of view, and that video is unironically more compelling and entertaining then this film. The Japanese were faced with several really tough and crucial decision points on that day, and 'Midway' managed to miss or ignore all of them. The main one of these, which the aforementioned video calls 'Nagumo's Dilemma' is that he had a choice between launching strike aircraft against the American fleet or waiting to land and refuel his initial strike force against the island of Midway, and risk having to ditch the entire 97 plane force into the sea. He decided on the latter, and thus became a fat sitting duck with a hold stuffed with planes and bombs.Instead on focusing on these compelling things, 'Midway' gave us shots of weepy wives and what Admiral Nimitiz was up to. I'm surprised they didn't include the 'Admiral Nimitiz visits the lavatory' scene. The battle scenes they did provide were confusing and video-game like (absolutely NOT realistic) in an attempt to dazzle the audience as opposed to the more difficult task of story-telling. I think the only hope one has of enjoying the film is if you are completely ignorant of the actual events of that day and can then attempt to enjoy the film 'as-is.' Also check out that youtube video, seriously.",5,3,5,23 December 2019
Life," Preposterous and Unbelievable
","Yes, the special effects in this movie are stunning and they generally go a great job of simulating space.... and there about ends my list of praises for 'Life.' In a word, the entire movie is ridiculous. I think the last Star Wars had more realism than this.The characters act stupid and make stupid decisions on a constant basis. I was greatly reminded of this year's 'Alien' movie where people know they are in danger and yet proceed to act reckless as if there is no danger at all, like no human would. This made me lose any attachment I might have had to the characters (which started off low as Ryan Reynolds is like nails on a chalkboard at the best of times). In general the acting was wooden and unbelievable. You can tell the most of the events in the movie are plot devices by the screenwriters to advance the plot to the next cool 'incident' they had thought of, forcing the actors to contort themselves to fit what was happening, so it's not entirely their fault.If you haven't seen 2013's 'Gravity,' do yourself a favour and watch that instead of this. If you have seen 'Gravity,' watch it again instead of this. Even this years Alien movie is head and shoulders above this, and I didn't particularly care for that either.",2,1,2,6 September 2017
Alien: Covenant," Great Comedy! Oh wait...
","The laughs just keep coming in the #1 comedy film of the year, Alien: Covenant. And I'm not just being sarcastic, there were multiple times where the theatre erupted in laughter. After recently watching 'Prometheus' and now this one, I'm thinking the major subplot of these movies is Ridely Scott saying 'humanity is stupid and deserves to die.' It's the only way I can explain how intentionally dumb the characters in these movies seem to be. I was so excited to see them probe the themes and style that was introduced in 'Prometheus,' which despite it's flaws I find to be a very good film. But instead Scott has gone back to the 1980s 'Aliens' film here with a lot of dumb guys running around with guns, which predictable results. Almost everything about 'Prometheus' was abandoned here. The only saving grace was Fassbender's portrayal of the androids. There were some good themes that were brushed on there, but the payoff just wasn't there. So I guess it comes down to what kind of movie you want to see. If you want a silly, mindless, suspense, horror, and action film (with a bit of unintentional comedy), here's your ticket.",5,4,12,20 May 2017
