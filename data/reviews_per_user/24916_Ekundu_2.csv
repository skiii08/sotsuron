The Blair Witch Project," The Best Horror Film Ever
","The only comment about this movie that I want to make is that while I was watching that movie, I identified with the characters so well that I actually felt their fear.  This movie is a splash of the unexpected in a technologically advanced world.  It frightened as well as amazed.I have one more thing to say about it.  Those of you who thought that this movie was too 'fake', 'unscripted', or 'jerky', that was the whole point of the movie.  It was not meant as a pleasant ride in the theater seat.  It was purposely done that way to achieve a desired effect, which in my case, it did in fact achieve.****",Null,1,2,22 August 1999
Beauty and the Beast," The best Disney Animated film ever made.
","This movie is definitely one of the best movies ever made, and by far the best animated movie I have seen.  Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise do an excellent job of making this Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale come to life.  Kudos also to Alen Menken for the score and Menken and Howard Ashton for the title song, both which won Oscars in 1991.",10,1,2,4 February 1999
