Hereditary," Just watched because Toni Collette is in it
","Toni Collette is such a good actress I thought I'd watch Hereditary. Her acting is excellent in this film so I gave it 3 stars for that. Everything else about this film is really tiresome. The plot follows a family who's matriarch recently passed away. This family inherits a sinister plan from the deceased grandmother.. By way of a support group, we find out the family has suffered a lot of deaths. The deaths just keep piling up as Toni Collette's character begins to realize her deceased mother was into devil worship. The ending was just so silly The plan is revealed to be that the sole male survivor of her family would become a devil. Not enough substance. Just everyone in the family freaking out when all sorts of silly things happen.",3,3,6,17 June 2018
Rocketman," Grew up on Elton John's music - Biased Review
","I loved every hit Elton John and Bernie Taupin produced in the 70s growing up as a teenager so I really hoped I'd like this film. I loved it. The telling of the story is much like the film Bohemian Rhapsody where the story follows Reggie's life growing up, his obvious natural talent, his collaboration with songwriter Bernie Taupin and the demons he chased as an adult in a life of fame, money, drugs and lovers yet ... such terrible loneliness. I didn't know this side of his life and I feel all the more grateful he gifted us with so much, when he himself felt so alone.The film is not all sad. It's done is such a delightful way. Elton John's songs are distributed at pivotal points in his life and the film switches momentarily to a choreographed musical filled with great dance moves and costumes. I adored this style and it was so well done, the film is reminiscent of the older well done musicals. Honesty, I can't remember a decent musical since Victor/Victoria by Blake Edwards in 1982.I laughed, shed a tear but mostly was thoroughly entertained at watching this depiction of the eccentric and talented life of Elton John.",10,1,1,25 March 2020
A Star Is Born," Very Over-Rated Film
",This film should not win any awards and is really over-rated. It's no where near as good as the original with Streisand (who can actually act).Chemistry between two leads is non existent. Singing is sub par. Storyline is old and tired. This is a renter at best.,5,2,6,5 February 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Much Better Than I Expected
","I ignore critics before seeing a film, knowing they often get it wrong. But I went to see this film thinking it was mostly going to show the excessive lifestyle of Queen members. Rather, Bohemian Rahapsody shows us the life of Farrokh Bulsara an immigrant from Zanzibar. Say what? That's our beloved Freddy Mercury alright. Son of immigrants, growing up in the UK. What a treat to see Freddy's personal life.Bohemian Rhapsody is done in a most human, emotional, respectful way. We see the rise and greatness of Queen, the only band in history where each member created a number one hit. But we also see how the band members had such amazing respect for one another, that they could let each other take turns in shining. Long live Queen.I've been a Rami Malek fan for a while but he really knocked it out of the park on his loving portrayal of Freddy. Was beautiful to see that long sweet friendship with Mary Austin.Just like critics were wrong about the band as they belted out hit after hit, the critics are wrong about this film. Fans know the truth, this film is worthy of the greatness that is Queen. Just beautifully done.",9,2,2,20 January 2019
The Favourite," Not That Much of a Comedy
",All 3 actresses are spectacular in their roles and the story is almost interesting enough ... a love/power triangle between 3 women. But in the end I was left feeling like I only got an inch of dessert instead of a whole slice. The film never made me laugh. Sorry ... naked man having fruit at him might make a pubescent boy laugh? And Stone jerking of her newly betrothed while telling the camera her plan? Just. Not. Funny. It's jolly good fun to poke fun at upright royalty. There are way better films than this one that do that.,5,0,2,6 January 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Good Bye Star Wars SPOILER alert
","Good bye Star Wars. I grew up with you in the original trilogy of 77, 80 and 83 and loved you then. I cherish memories of that original trilogy. I suffered through every Star Wars film after that in the hopes that someone could 'capture the essence' of the original trilogy which was excellent story-telling and dangerous and heroic adventure among unlikely friends. In the Force Awakens. Rey, Poe, and Finn have chemistry but these characters need a worthy story-line. The Last Jedi fails miserably in delivering an actual story and killed all my hope that Star Wars can be saved. The Resistance evading the First Order in space is not a sufficient plot. Little sub plots like trips to another planet to find the code-breaker completely fall flat. Rey's time on the island ... Luke Skywalker is a depressing mess, skulking about because he failed one pupil. Even Obi Wan Kenobi kept the faith despite Darth Vader. No wonder Mark Hamill complained Skywalker's integrity was not upheld in Rian Johnson's depiction of his character. He actually said the Jedi should end? Come on now. That is sacrilege in this universe!Although I had hopes for Rey, Poe and Finn in Force Awakens ... their dialogue didn't work in the Last Jedi. It was at times cheesy and elsewhere too simplistic. Really really disappointed. I drove home feeling sad .. which surprised me .. until I realized The Last Jedi is the last Star Wars I'll ever watch again.
Rian Johnson should not be writing/directing Star Wars, plain and simple.",3,4,6,24 December 2017
Mudbound," An Important Film Even if Executed a little too slowly for me
","I felt the film dragged in the first hour, but once the two boys came back from WWII, one from a white family and the other from a black family, the story was rolling. Very sick how young men who served in the war had to return to disgusting racism. A whole new fresh horror awaited them. After the ending, I felt I needed to watch Mississippi Burning just to get a feeling of justice. What a lawless hole the south was. After seeing all the black children murdered in recent years, Roy Moore's base comments in Alabama, and juvenile actions of Trump, I ask myself where is the leadership in America to finally address the over incarceration of black men, lax gun laws, police brutality, white privilege in the justice system, etc?? This film did not leave me with a sense of hope. After WWII, many black men moved to Europe where they were treated as equals. I realize the Mudbound story takes place in 1940s but do people actually think America is the land of the free today? I don't think so. And seeing Americans vote someone like Trump into power only makes those of us on the outside wonder ... what is the fate of this country? .",7,20,40,19 November 2017
Joker," Is it JOKER ... or is societal commentary?
","Wow. Excellent film. I watch anything with Joaquin Phoenix ... I've long thought he might be the best actor of our time.Which is why sitting through a film of his interpretation of Joker is one helluva hard slog. The story follows Arthur Fleck's descent mentally and his descent into becoming Joker. My heart broke continually, such is Phoenix' believable acting. The ending is very powerful and left me thinking this film is a commentary on the marginalized and misunderstood of our society. We see the shootings done by guys who snapped. These lonely forgotten folks are right in our midst and we've become such an indifferent human species ... not long before we really are full out chaos of Gotham. p.s. I don't think Phoenix cares if he gets an Oscar - that's just how he rolls. But he definitely deserves one for this performance. What a talent.",9,1,2,4 October 2019
The Mission," It's a masterpiece
","I've re-watched this film every few years since it came out. Besides stunning cinematography, the story line is beautifully told. The story follows the unlikely friendship between a Jesuit and a repentant slave trader and how each man decides to react to impossible circumstances among the original peoples in South America, before Spanish colonization and Portugese slave trading ruined this garden of eden. Jeremy Irons and Robert de Niro. And the deft hand of Roland Joffe. It doesn't get much better than that.",10,2,5,5 February 2019
The Queen," Watched it 3 times
","I've watched The Queen 3 times and I'm not even a fan of 'royalty'. Helen Mirren's acting is so incredible in this film. Saying everything without a word. Whether you like royalty or not, this film is deeply nuanced with layers of different people's truths. The story line follows Tony Blair's involvement with Queen Elizabeth immediately following Princess Diana's death. Their relationship is very sweet. Two worlds colliding, the past with the now. I could feel the burden Queen Elizabeth carried, as she became queen at a very young age and gave her whole life to service and restraint. Because of this restraint, the public never really knew what goes on behind closed doors. The public never knew the Diana the royal family knew. It is sacrilege to say anything negative about Diana, but she had to go through her growing and healing pains, married off at 18 into a world wholly unprepared and still carrying skeletons of her childhood. The queen and Prince Charles were ill equipped to help her. There is no 'good guy' or 'bad guy' in this film. Just characters being true to what shaped them. And masterfully shows that change can happen through relationship with one another. Lovely film that I'll likely watch a 4th time.",10,1,1,25 May 2018
Mother!," And God saith: they're just things, they can be replaced?
","I wish Aronofsky would stop twisting themes from the bible for his films. I get it. It's a rich well from which to draw. But, in my opinion, Aronofsky failed on Noah and he fails in Mother. This film is tedious and I kept watching the clock to see how many more minutes.Spoiler alert... If you are going to watch this film, I suggest you understand Javier Bardem plays God, Jennifer Lawrence plays Mother earth, Ed Harris plays Adam and Michelle Pfeiffer plays Eve. Also their sons Cain and Abel are involved. If you know the premise of the film, you can better understand AronofsTky's storyline.As to borrowing from the bible, why re-create the real story? The real thing is insanely beautiful. For those of us who believe in a loving God as first person of the Holy Trinity of Father, Son and Holy Spirit, the film Mother falls grossly short. God is depicted as a writer who loves humanity, with an insatiable need to create. But his character is written far too simply to lend itself to any depth. God is both Mercy and ... Justice. As to Mercy, the film's quicky interpretation of Jesus' sacrificial Passion is just ... I have no words.As to Justice, God does not see the elements of nature as just 'things that can be replaced'. All of mother earth, its minerals, plants, animal life, are considered extremely valuable and mankind will have to account for its poor stewardship of these minor kingdoms.I give it 5 points for the message of humanity destroying mother earth, while she simply offers herself up, time and again. We indeed need to change our ways on land and sea. I also give it points for depicting Mother earth as entirely dependent on humanity for how she fares. She really is entirely dependent on us. In the film, Mother rose to destroy ... we see it happening in stages right now. Yes, yes, I understand some may read this and think, holy cow woman, stop expecting a film to fit into your ideology. The thing is, when you twist someone's faith into your own personal artistic impression, it's probably a good idea to have in-depth knowledge and treat with care. Imagine if someone inaccurately, and woefully inadequately, did a twisted artistic impression based on religious themes from Islam or Hinduism. Surely we must treat these things with the respect they deserve.I wish Aronofsky would finally make the film Tiger based on the book by John Vaillant. Both he and Brad Pitt are attached to this project. I know Aronofsky would do a great job on this. Cover nature, but leave your artistic impressions of God.",5,9,18,4 October 2017
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," This type of excellence will never be repeated
","So there's two trilogies I watch over and over again, year over year and sometimes even more than once/year. The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the Swedish Millennium Trilogy (Girl with Dragon Tattoo).Lord of the Rings, Return of the King is my favorite of the three because it's on an epic scale of film-making that we'll likely never see again. From beginning to end, the story-telling, location, dialogue, character development, direction, acting, costuming, set design, cinematography, you name it, all of it is stellar in this film. I was in love with the books and this trilogy, similar to Oplev and Alfredson's Millennium films, adapted to the books in a spectacular way, as to be rendered in a class of their own.",10,1,1,2 September 2017
