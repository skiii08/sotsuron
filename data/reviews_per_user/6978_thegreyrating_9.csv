Captain Phillips," The Grey Rating: Captain Phillips
","The Grey Rating: Captain Phillips A flexible rating system used to determine the quality of a movie based on a methodical comparison with the film masterpiece, The Grey.+ Well developed themes of survival and the drive to live, including individual and group survival. + Creative use of broken glass as an improvised weapon + Predator and prey group dynamics + Isolated environment<ul><li>Lack of wolves - Lack of Sir Liam Neeson - Set entirely on a boat in the middle of the ocean - Unambiguous ending</li></ul>At first this film got me quite excited because there was a predatory group preying on a hapless group of misfits, led by a strong leader in an isolated and lonely environment. However, it soon became rather depressing as the predatory group proved not at all as strong or versatile as one would have hoped. If this situation and storyline was attempted with The Grey the film would have ended with the US Army Arctic Response team parachuting down and sniping the wolf pack from mid air. Thankfully the writers of Captain Phillip were not contacted by The Grey's production team.",4,0,2,5 December 2014

The Twilight Saga: New Moon," The Grey Rating: The Twilight Saga: New Moon
","The Grey Rating: The Twilight Saga: New MoonA flexible rating system used to determine the quality of a movie based on a methodical comparison with the film masterpiece, The Grey.+ Set on the West Coast, which is kind of near Alaska? I don't know. This is hard.<ul><li>Lack of Sir Liam Neeson - Trivial and superficial themes - Overdone in every way - Incredibly fake wolves, or werewolves, whatever, that are also hairless man-children and presented in CGI</li></ul>I was told I would enjoy this movie because there were wolves in it. Well, technically that is not correct. This movie is really horrible. There is nothing in it that redeems itself as a film except possibly the vaguely similar landscape and terrain.",2,4,6,5 December 2014
Taken," The Grey Rating: Taken
","The Grey Rating: Taken A flexible rating system used to determine the quality of a movie based on a methodical comparison with the film masterpiece, The Grey.+ Themes of survival, the killing instinct, drive to survive are explored + Sir Liam Neeson + Simple, well written and doesn't try to be something it is not. Owns its identity. + Action sequences that are not overwrought <ul><li>Lack of wolves - Warm climate - Lack of poetry - Set in Paris</li></ul>This film has a lot of similarities with The Grey in terms of how it was produced and received by audiences. You could write off both The Grey and Taken as low budget action films without much substance, but then you would watch them and realise how much of a horrible person you are for judging a film based on its appearance. Remember, making judgements based on superficial externalities and stereotypes will lead to intense introspection and personal reflection when these judgements are shown to be wrong.",7,0,1,5 December 2014
