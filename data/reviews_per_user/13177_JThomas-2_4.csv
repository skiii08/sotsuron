The Legend of Bagger Vance," Really good - not great - but hit the spot!
","Another reviewer said it, but it's true:  This isn't a great film, but it really was entertaining.  I don't know what I was expecting when I watched it, but I don't think it was what Redford presented.  While in places the film failed to deliver (was Bagger real or not?; did the tournament save the country club?), all in all it was a really good film.  The acting was superb.  I found myself laughing out loud many times at quiet little jokes that hit the spot for me.  Now, I'm not a golfer, but I was raised one, so maybe that's why I liked it in part.  Other than that - the cinematography was superb - the settings agonizingly beautiful - and the costuming was dynamite.  I find myself liking Damon more and more with each film - he seems to grow more as an actor.  And Charlize Theron is just flat gorgeous! And interestingly, I found myself wondering just who was playing Bobby Jones.  Joel Gretsch, who plays him, makes him seem as if he really were a professional golfer.  Take a couple hours and rent this film - I think you'll like it.",Null,0,1,10 April 2001
Fight Club," Fight Club is a Geek Show!
","Brad Pitt, as America's most underrated actor (could it be because he's looks the way he does?), does a wonderful turn as Tyler Durden in this purile film.  And Bonham Carter, Norton, and Meatloaf are all good as well. (I don't know why Pitt got so excited about this project.  I surely don't know why he would file his teeth down to perform in it.)Come on, I'm a guy and I'm over thirty, and I couldn't bear to watch the screen the whole time - and it wasn't because it was scary - it was because it was GROSS!  This is a gross out film.  Watching it is like being forced to watch THE FACES OF DEATH over and over again - and liking it!While Tyler wants to reach 'rock bottom', I don't think we need to see it in all it's detail.The same moral and message was in The Portait of Dorian Grey and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, but without the gross-out factor.I went home and took a shower after seeing this film!",Null,0,1,18 October 1999
American Beauty," The misinformed Hollywood idea of typical American life
","I did theatre with Wes Bentley, so I know that the performance he delivered in this film was a good one.  That's why I went to see the film.  Would I see it again?  Have I rented it, since it's been on tape? No.Hollywood doesn't know how to present a 'day-in-the-life-of-the-average-joe' film, because Hollywood is so far removed from the typical day-to-day workings of real people.  And I hate to say it, but much of California suffers from the same malady.When you've got paparzzi, fans, autograph hounds, biographers, managers, agents, publicists, etc. hounding you day after day, you start thinking that living like that is the norm.  Hey, I'm not knocking it....  It's just not the way most of us on this planet live.  Yeah, we've got people stalking us: bill collectors, telephone solicitors, children, door to door salepeople, etc., but frankly, most of us in the real world, don't relate to the poor, poor Hollywood lifestyle.  (Most people would kill to have film actor's problems).Instead of producing 'average joe' films written by Hollywood screenwriters, maybe Hollywood could look to where the real stories are:  America.  UPDATE: Hollywood!  Hey!  Most of the population of the USA doesn't live in L.A. - get a clue.  Most white people aren't bigots.  Most men don't beat their wives.  Most people are decent, law-abiding citizens, who live their whole lives without a single person ever documenting their lives.  We live thankless, ordinary lives, and hope that when we die we can leave a legacy to our children or our families.  Most of us don't spew four letter words with every breath.  Write about that.  Life has become tough enough in this country.  Stop making it worse.  Instead of building resentments and fueling anger, maybe Hollywood could practice a bit of what it did in its real heyday (the 30's and 40's) and promote the American way of life.  'Cause you know what?  That's what most of us are living.........",1,17,40,26 February 2001
Gladiator," Hollywood finally tells a good story again!
","Gladiator is really a sweeping epic of a film!  It is truly something else. I've been waiting for this type of film to be made again.  It's a lot like the great big films of the late fifties.  There's no sex, no foul language, and no nudity - instead they tell a gritty, fantastically engrossing story that kept me white knuckled throughout most of it.The acting is superb and the casting is dynamite.  I really despised Phoenix's character - just what I was supposed to feel.  I had never thought much of this younger brother to River Phoenix, but now I see that he really can deliver.  And Crowe, well, let's just say I've been waiting for the U.S. to realize what a great actor this man is.Gladiator and U-571 are two of the finest films Hollywood has cranked out in decades.  They've really told stories and stories that don't need the 'F' word peppered throughout it (tell me where the difficulty there is for screenwriters to come up with that word?)  I'm very liberal and not much bothers me, but I'm sick to death of cursing in movies when it doesn't add to the film and it just seems to be in there for shock value.So, now I can really say, 'Hurray for Hollywood!'",Null,0,0,11 May 2000
