Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Caru Reviews---Pirates Of The Caribbean On Stranger Tides
",Jack sparrow is back in action with a new completely storyline and characters.this time he is after the extraordinary delusional fountain of youth.The adventure is not easy for jack sparrow because he has a lot of opposing armies against him like the military led by Barbosa and the gritty pirate Blacbeard.the adventure is filled with a lot of action and sword fights completely with laughter.the acting is excellent as ever like the previous movies of the pirates of the Caribbean franchise.Love is also portrayed in this story between certain characters(avoiding spoilers).Johnny Depp really showed excellence of comedy and acting in this movie.9/10 (excellent),9,1,2,4 June 2011
The Hangover Part II," Caru Reviews---The Hangover 2
","to start off this movie is awesome and funny as the first film.i watched yesterday with my friends and really had a great time.in this particular episode we find the wolf pack in Thailand and as you anticipate they have a nasty hangover again.although it is based on the same setting as the first one its unbelievably unpredictable and a lot of surprises every scene.we see some characters that were in the previous film like the Chinese mafia dude and he is hilarious as ever.although this is a great comedy, the movie featured a lot of cool action sequences like gunfights etc.the combination of rapid action and comedy is excellent in this movie.the acting was also superb and Thailand was beautiful as ever with its atmospheric scenes.i highly recommend this movie to anyone for great action and have a great laugh.don't listen to critics if they gave it a low score,this movie is a must watch.9/10(excellent)",9,3,6,4 June 2011
