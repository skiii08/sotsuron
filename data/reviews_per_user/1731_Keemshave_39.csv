Ford v Ferrari," An exhilarating and emotional ride
","A lot of notes were hit by Ford v Ferrari. The characters are fleshed out very well and give you the emotional attachment you're looking for in a movie. Bale and Damon's performances are great; they pull you into the story and completely disappear into their roles. James Mangold proves, once again, to be a master behind the camera. The action scenes are shot to perfection and will have you biting your nails.The film's technical aspects were top-notch as well. Wait for this film to be nominated for sound design and editing. These technical aspects, during the climax of the film, will blow your hair back and give you goosebumps.All in all, this film provides a pleasing experience for the crowd that not many films can even come close to delivering. I loved about every second of it, despite its long runtime.",9,125,156,21 November 2019
Blade Runner 2049," A work of art.
","This film is a showcase for beautiful cinematography. The story is compelling and builds off the original very well too. Roger Deakins is the star of this show, however, as this film is truly a work of art. Any given scene will give you an 'eyegasm'. The direction is also top notch from Denis. Not many directors can capitalize on such an extraordinary universe and expand upon it in the way that he did here. Blade Runner 2049 may not have started the franchise, but the argument can be made that it is the stronger of the 2 entries.",10,6,20,25 February 2020
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Very satisfying ending to this revenge tale.
","Quinten Tarantinos writing shines brightly in this film. The dialogue is enthralling to go along with a very unique and thought-provoking narrative structure. I did enjoy this one slightly more than volume 1 simply because of the depth added to the main characters. Bill, especially, was an astoundingly fascinating character. A movie that encapsulates this awesome revenge story that I will be revisiting time and time again.",9,1,1,24 March 2020
Walk the Line," A perfect experience.
","From the story-telling to the acting, this film is top notch. Providing emotion, laughs, and musical entertainment 'Walk the Line' succeeds in every way. Phoenix gives an all-time great performance as Cash but Witherspoon is not to be overlooked either. An incredibly insightful bio-pic that holds a special place in film history.",10,4,5,4 June 2019
Source Code," An awesome sci-fi thriller
","Source Code is a really cool movie. The film flows at a very steady pace and does not drag at all. Gyllenhaal gives a very strong performance and gives the lead character some emotional weight as well.The movie was unpredictable throughout and throws you some cool curveballs that you won't see coming. Well directed, written, and acted. Not much I can complain about with this one.",9,0,1,25 November 2019
Inglourious Basterds," My favorite Tarantino flick.
","You can pick and choose from just about any of Tarantinos movies and claim it as your favorite. Mine is Inglorious Basterds.From the dialogue to the set design, costume design, shot direction, the acting, etc...this film is flawless in my eyes. It is hard to think of a better straight forward narrative written by Tarantino, perhaps Resevoir Dogs, but I think the scope of this film gives it a slight edge. Even the score fits the film so beautifully; when the end credits begin to roll I always get goosebumps.It is definitely the film of his that I have the most fun with. Tarantino has yet to top himself since the release of this film IMO...this might just be his masterpiece...",10,1,2,17 April 2020
Happy Gilmore," One of the most entertaining movies of all time
","You can nit-pick Adam Sandler movies all you want. None are particularly well-written or directed brilliantly but that didn't matter during this era of Sandler films. This film is hilarious and timeless. It has some of the funniest on screen jokes and scenes that I have ever seen. It is endlessly rewatchable because of the charisma of a young Adam Sandler. With an all time great movie villain, Shooter Mcgavin, you just cant go wrong in watching this movie for a pure fun time. I've probably seen this film over 100 times and it still entertains the crap out of me. I can't judge this film from an artistic perspective, because the cast and crew were not remotely going for that. As a pure comedy, it's a 10/10, and one of the best comedy films ever made",10,2,3,10 July 2019
Hot Fuzz," Extremely entertaining
","This movie is awesome! Such a fun time, especially the 2nd half of the film. Simon pegg kills it as usual. Clever, hilarious, and exciting.",9,1,1,1 August 2019
Taxi Driver," Masterpiece of film making
","Definitley a movie that may polarize many and it has a very strange and unique style. However, its character study is excellent and unmatched by most. During its time, films like this were not made often and it really pushed the boundaries for its time. De Niro also sets the tone for a fantastic career, which was already starting to gain steam. One of Martin S's best for sure!",9,2,3,5 April 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Unpredictably unique
","A movie like this only comes around every so often. A film with exceptional writing, acting, and as unpredictable as a film can be.The blend of drama and humor is so seamless and effective that each scene will sweep you off your feet. You truly don't know where each scene may take you because of this incredible execution of tonal shift.The performances of Mcdormand, Rockwell, and Harrelson are awesome. It is hard to remember a film that has had 3 power-house performances like this. The awards were well deserved.The themes of this film are extremely strong as well. Three Billboards has no fear in exploring dark territory and uses relevant social commentary to exclaim its message.My one negative would be the ending. Although somber and reflective, it left me wanting more and felt a bit abrupt.",9,1,2,22 January 2020
The Devil Wears Prada," Suprised the heck out of me.
","This screams the type of movie that I dont particularly enjoy, but this movie really entertained me. It came off as a chick flick on the surface but I couldn't be more wrong. This movie was funny, inspiring, and surprisingly nerve-racking. Great performances all around as well. Definitely a movie with plenty of rewatchability.",9,1,2,29 June 2019
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," An action masterpiece spectacle.
","Technical masterpiece with incredible characters and character moments. Quite literally some of the greatest actions scenes put to film. Satisfying story elements that should have concluded the franchise. The Terminator franchise ends with this one, for me.",10,4,6,28 May 2019
Collateral," An extremely effective action thriller.
","Fast paced, well acted, beautifully shot, incredible cinematography, and has a good overall theme. Collateral is entertaining and has plenty of rewatchability. The film gets a tad bit predictable towards the end, which took me out of the film slightly, but the totality of the films story is strong. The first half of the film was phenomenal.Can't wait to go back and give it another watch.",8,2,3,12 February 2020
Avengers: Endgame," Fantastic conclusion to this Marvel generation.
","Nearly perfect in every way, Endgame justifies it's 3 hour run time with incredible character moments, epic scenes, and satisfying character write offs. The perfect extension of Infinity War...A five a half hour epic between the two films that I believe many will go back and watch time and time again. The only flaw I had was a bit of a slow pace in the beginning and some jokes that didn't land. Will Definitely be seeing multiple times!",9,0,1,29 April 2019
Foxcatcher," Well made drama.
","A film crafted in an extremely artful and detail-oriented approach. Great Carrell and Ruffalo performances, but Tatum's performance is a bit bland. Tatum's character arc seems very rushed; the writing seems to leave out key details that lead to the change in character motives. However, despite these flaws the film delivers on the shock value of these true events. Definitely worth the watch.",7,0,1,28 May 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Artsy film that provides good entertainment.
","Let me start this analysis by saying one thing, far too long. This movie is expertly crafted and performed, but this film's length can hamper the pleasure that somebody would get from the experience. Tarantino brings together a magnificent tribute to this era of cinema and truly shows his love for that time. Dicaprio and Pitt perform as normal, stunning on all levels of performance. Of course, the dialogue will pull you into the world that has been created by Tarantino, and I would expect nothing less from Quentin. This film had me thoroughly entertained, providing laughs and solid dramatic elements, throughout most of its length. The payoff at the end of the movie was also worth the wait.On a side note, I'd like to see Tarantino shoot a movie with a much shorter runtime than he produced. It seems as if he's in a 3-hour 'Scorsesse' mode, but he doesn't provide a story that's interesting enough to captivate an audience for so long. It sounds harsh, but I can tolerate it and enjoy the film as an advent movie lover. Nonetheless, seeing this movie from the viewpoint of a casual audience member, I can understand why they would not like this film.",9,1,4,23 October 2019
1917," A beautiful film that pushes the envelope.
","A film that takes risks, not only in the presentation but also in the story of it. A well-performed war drama which has a unique one-shot style.It's always nice to see a film as refreshing as this one. It reminded me of Birdman in the way it looked. Amazingly, they used this filmmaking style for a war film.The use of World War 1 as the stage is another breath of fresh air, I feel like we don't see that as often as we should.Roger Deakins is the star of the show here and only confirms, yet again, that he is Hollywood's most talented cinematographer. The film's shot and art direction is perfect and will be a shoo-in for a lot of awards, no doubt.Sam Mendes is a very talented director and this is one of the best war movies in recent memory. A breathtaking experience!I won't give this film a 10/10 because the characters aren't entirely compelling. They provide emotional weight but not an incredible amount of it. A small nitpick for sure, but enough to say that it is not 'perfect' film.",9,0,1,15 January 2020
From Dusk Till Dawn," Entertaining monster flick.
",A movie that will have you laughing at the sheer absurdity of its scenes. The corny scenes fit the tone of the film as well. Practical effects are better in some scenes than others but overall it works throughout the film. It's a nice change of pace from the first half of the film to the second. A good Halloween monster flick and has a solid Clooney performance.,7,5,5,28 May 2019
The Dark Knight," One of Christopher Nolan's masterpieces.
","What can I say about the Dark Knight that hasn't already been said? The film is perfect. Not many films have zero flaws, but The Dark Knight is one of them. The suspense, unpredictable story, and cut-throat pace are just a few of the main reasons this film is lauded as an all-time classic.It is the only superhero film truly transcending the genre. It expands its scope into so many previously unseen regions. Indeed, it is mind-boggling that a batman film can be a work of art.Christopher Nolan is a visionary, and one of the world's most talented filmmakers. He is one of the few blockbuster filmmakers who still have complete artistic freedoms over the process of making films and I can not be more grateful for that fact. His shooting in this movie might be the best of his career, and that is saying a lot.Now to Heath Ledger, a legend whose brilliance never saw the sun. I wonder if Heath realized when he was shooting this film that he put together one of the best performances in film history by an actor. His interpretation of the Joker, combined with the vision of Nolan, is one of the best performances ever put on film. This is not to understate the rest of the performances. Bale, Cane, Maggie, Oldman, Eckhart, and the rest of the cast all worked fantastically.",10,0,0,26 March 2020
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Thought provoking and Unique.
",Not many films can combine serious dramatic elements and science fiction so seamlessly. The film will constantly having you guessing and will have you wondering where it is all leading. Not many films can manage to confuse you and fascinate you in such a way that keeps you thoroughly entertained. Carrey gives a career-best performance here and only proves his overall talent as an actor.,10,1,1,31 March 2019
National Treasure," Pretty Underrated.
","I have perpetually been a sucker for the hunting legends of treasure. It has to be the feeling of adventure present in these sorts of movies. This movie isn't based on fact and you can nitpick 90 percent of the plot points if you like, however, you can turn your brain off and enjoy the film much more.You're much better off with this mentality, as this film sustains a good deal of fun. Nicholas Cage performs typically goofy and the guy can't help but entertain me. The fact that the writers took something that would otherwise be considered boring and made it very interesting, even when almost completely fictitious, is the element that makes this movie so pleasant to me.Some of the lines are cringe-worthy and certain plot points are difficult to get through, but that is to be anticipated for such a ludicrous story. Just sit back and have fun with it!",7,0,0,14 April 2020
Sicario," Tense and beautifully shot.
","This film is intense. It's a simple concept that does not follow the cliche plot lines of the genre it's in. Sicario is unpredictable and dark. Something you could see taking place in the real world.Roger Deakins is the cinematographer for this film. He lives up to his name, once again, and gives us a beautiful movie to look at. Some of the shots are breathtaking.The acting is also top notch. Emily Blunt, now perhaps my favorite actress, is flawless in this film and gives us a great character to see the story through. However, Del Toro is the star of the show...he is badass and nailed every scene he is in; definitely the most fascinating character in the movie.Sicario is yet another great movie from Denis. He is one of the most talented directors working today and this film perpetuates that fact.",9,0,0,12 June 2020
Titanic," One of the best films ever made.
","How could I not give this film a 10/10. Sure, there is some corny dialogue and some romance that gets a bit too sentimental for my taste, but that doesn't hold this film back from greatness. It's the best romance film ever made and will have you tearing up no doubt. Once the iceberg is hit, the film goes to another level. The already well established characters are thrown into this tragedy that had me glued to the screen. Cameron's production is far ahead of it's time and deserves all the praise that it gets. The ending is also something that really makes me think about life and death, as a philosophical thinker. Having a dreamlike state after death and seeing what you truly care about...meeting up with the ones you love...is heaven. It's such a beautiful ending and gives me chills everytime.",10,5,9,27 June 2019
Zombieland," Fun film and rewatchable.
",An hour and a half of pure fun. It's hard to find films that fly by quite like this one. It has one of the best cameos ever in film. Hilarious from start to finish and it also has a clever editing style. It's not perfect but I can go back and watch this film plenty of times. It's a movie that will put you in a good mood.,8,1,2,1 August 2019
The Witch," An expertly crafted unsettling picture.
","If you are into artsy films with solid substance, then you will appreciate this film. The Witch takes risks and succeeds on nearly every one of them. The unsettling and eerie nature of each scene gave me goosebumps. The score gives off a similar feeling that The Shining had, and it elevates each scene when it is used. The actors succeeded in being believable in the films dramatic and thrilling scenes, and the script asked a lot out of them. I cannot commend the cast enough for pulling off certain scenes. This film may disturb many people, and I would definitely proceed with caution if you are sensitive to religious themed horror.My only true negatives would he the slow start of the film and the rewatchability. It's hard to imagine myself going back to watch this film again because of the sheer unsettling nature of the premise.",8,2,3,28 October 2019
Joker," Amazing and refreshing.
","Disturbing, realistically dark, and jaw-dropping. Joker pushes all the right buttons to make a cohesive and convincing journey into madness. Psychologically tolling and chilling scenes will take you off your feet
..
Expertly crafted and an ALL TIME performance by Joaquin Phoenix. Todd Phillips really surprised me with his ability to construct a drama/thriller. This movie will go down as the most memorable movie of 2019. Hopefully they expand upon this universe further; it would be nice to see Joaquin helm this character again. Although, this man is an artist, and it doesnt seem in his nature to join a superhero franchise. One can hope though, right? I need to see this film again and again another time to give it my perfect 10 score...I'm on the fence about a 9 or 10 because of some minor gripes that may even disappear with a second viewing. Don't miss this spectacle!",9,0,1,8 October 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," An incredible ride.
","This film was so much fun! The idea was original, the action was awesome, and the characters were very easy to root for! Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt's chemistry is very strong too. The twists and turns will have you on the edge of your seat! Very unpredictable.",10,2,2,3 October 2019
Whiplash," Masterpiece.
","The moment the credits rolled I knew I saw something special. Acting, direction, production is all perfect. Snappy, witty, sharp scenes filled with lush dialogue that gives significant meaning to all characters. This movie will make your jaw drop. Prepare to be wowed.",10,0,1,28 May 2019
Army of Darkness," Very underrated.
",Flies by with its hour and 20 minute runtime. This film is extremely entertaining and proves how creative Raimi can be with a concept. A slightly forgotten film that doesnt get the recognition it deserves. I believe this film is stronger than Evil Dead 1 and nearly on Evil Dead 2's level.,8,4,6,23 September 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Underappreciated epic film
","This film was what the prequel trilogy should have been. The phantom menace and attack of the clones were sub par but I believe this film nailed it for the most part. Aside from some corny dialogue and questionable choreography, this movie had some of the best moments in the saga. Anakin's turn was very well done, especially during the Mustafar scenes. It is a heartbreaking tragedy and I wish the previous 2 films would have set up this one much better. Nonetheless, this movie picks up the slack and delivers a great back story for the original films that we all love. Plenty of epic scenes to fulfill its hype. Obviously from a film making standpoint, this film is not on the empire strikes backs level, but from a entertainment value perspective I believe Revenge of the sith holds a light to empire.",9,6,8,14 July 2019
The Terminal," Entertaining Hanks flick
","A film for Tom Hanks lovers. He carrys the movie with an outstanding performance. Despite narrative issues and puzzling character motives, The Terminal succeeds as a satisfying feel-good movie.",7,1,1,23 July 2019
Halloween," One of the greatest horror films of all time.
","Atmospheric, chilling, and suspenseful. Halloween is one of those films that has become truly timeless. John Carpenter created something that will stand the test of time, with an extremely low budget. The eerie score is etched in millions of people's minds and can send shivers down your whole body on its own. This is the greatest movie of the fall season that is never going to be surpassed. Some of the acting is not the greatest, but the performances of Donald Pleasance and Jamie Lee Curtis make up for that. The examination of evil and the attempt to stop it, and perhaps to understand the origin of it, is a theme that Halloween nails. A film with endless rewatchability and an easy 10 out of 10.",10,1,2,17 October 2019
The Silence of the Lambs," One of the greatest films ever made.
","Chilling and enthralling, Silence of the Lambs captures the madness of serial killers and the psychology that may explain their motives. If you were wondering what a perfect film might look like, check this one out.",10,1,1,3 October 2019
Before Sunrise," Beautiful.
","It'll blow you away with its realism. This film presents the awkward, spontaneous, and genuine moments that real relationships have. It felt as if was watching two real people fall in love. Loved every minute of it...the philosophical conversations fascinated me. 1000% my favorite romance movie of all time because of its realism. This is a truly fantastical film that inspires you to find love.",10,5,5,30 June 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Perhaps the greatest film ever made.
","It is difficult to argue that many films should sit on top of the mountain of the greatest movies ever made, but one of those is The Return of the King. Technical, writing, and production aspects are all the best you can have in a film.The most impressive thing about ROTK is that it is the series ' third entry and that it is so good. Most trilogies that exist have the problem of the third being the weakest in the bunch. Not with this trilogy, though, this film is incredible on all levels.This film's drama and overall epicness is something I have simply not seen since its release. Not many films can so effortlessly blend fantasy and serious dramatic plot elements that sell the film's overall message.Not to forget the amazing display of acting that the whole cast put together. This is one aspect of the movie that does not appear to be getting enough credit. EVERYONE sells every scene and contributes to the film's immersion.The Return of the King holds the record, in a tie, for the most academy awards ever won and I cannot think of another film more deserving of this honor. The world-building displayed by Peter Jackson, coupled with the cast and crew, has not been matched outside of this series.",10,4,5,19 February 2020
The Truman Show," Brilliant
","A unique idea that was executed to perfection. The screenplay, acting, and direction are all top notch in this movie. With Jim Carreys emphatic charisma this film suceeds in not only being extremely entertaining, but also as a dramatic thriller with an eye-opening message.",10,0,0,13 February 2020
Heat," Greatest Heist film of all time
","With its incredible direction, acting, and underlying themes this is without a doubt the best heist film put to screen. The payoff of the action is well worth the wait, and the dramatic elements only elevate the stakes of each action scene. One of the only films De Niro and Pacino act along side each other. DON'T MISS THIS ONE!",10,3,3,31 March 2019
Sin City," Terrifically crafted film. Excellent entertainment.
","'The fire baby. It'll burn us both.' I love this film. Each story is beautiful in it's own way, and offers badass characters to boot. Without a doubt, one of the best graphic novel adaptations of all time...",9,2,2,7 February 2019
The Nice Guys," Hilarious and creative
","This film is so entertaining! Gosling and Crowe have incredible chemistry and I hope they work together again. Gosling will have you laughing throughout the movie with his line delivery, which is also a testament to Shane Black's writing and directing. A creative piece of film making that you don't see very often! Can't wait to watch this plenty of more times in the future.",9,7,9,10 January 2020
