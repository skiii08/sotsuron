First Man," It gets better if you watch it as a satire.
","Ok, this movie is not edge-of-your-seat stuff, and that's the way they wanted to tell the story, so nothing wrong with that. It's just that you'll have to prepare for 2 hours of mostly wonderful imagery with no plot attached to it. Real stories are extremely hard to adapt into screenplays but other writers have done this better. For example: Rush (2013), Argo (2012), The Imitation Game (2014), The Intouchables (2011) and other I don't remember or haven't watched yet.I realized half hour through the movie, that if I considered it as a satire I would like it much more, and that's what happened.",5,1,3,7 February 2019
Your Name.," Restoring faith in cinema - even with its inevitable flaws.
","As many have said, this film makes you feel things that few others have in the last decade. It's a collage of mesmerizing animation, original story, heartwarming music and relatable characters, put together with a captivating plot.Despite some plot holes, inevitable with these type of stories, this film manages to stay focused and never lose track of its goal: give the audience a unique cinematic experience.After finished watching, I had forgotten how to breath properly. If a film does this, it has absolutely fulfilled its purpose and becomes more than just entertainment.",9,0,0,10 February 2019
John Wick," Horrid!!!
","Idiotic movie with well executed action scenes, nothing else.
The only good thing in this film is the 'English, please' recurring joke.",3,2,3,31 May 2019
Joker," Not compelling story, predictable plot, provocative for all the wrong reasons!
","I kind of expected this film to not be that good and I was careful not to get in the 'hype train,' but it's still sad watching it fail like this.What fails the most in Joker is obviously the script. The story it's not something I would die to watch, keeping in mind Joker in the comics has some of the most compelling stories ever; the plot is basic and predictable; the theme that the film is trying to communicate, it's so poorly conveyed that I'm not even sure if that's the actual theme. The film is provocative for all the wrong reasons.The only good things about Joker are the score and, of course, Joaquin Phoenix's mesmerizing performance.",5,2,7,4 October 2019
