Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lucas turns to the Kiddie side
","The fall of Lucas started with the Solo scene in the Star War's Special Edition, when he softened the Greedo shoots first  scene. I got a little worried,when I should have gotten a lot worried! I take that back it may have happened during Jedi.I also think that Episode 1 was made for his 6 year old son. Lucas should of had Darth Maul fight a savage scene with some Sand People on Tatooine at least!But he probably didn't want anymore violence than necessary.Killing Darth Maul showed some of the old Lucas guts! After seeing Episode 1, I think it ranks with Jedi well below Star Wars ANH & The Empire Strikes Back.The next two better not be as wimpy after all this is Star WAR(S)!",1,0,1,21 May 1999
