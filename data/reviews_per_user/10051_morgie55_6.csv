Skyfall," One of the Better Daniel Craig Outings!!
","Daniel Craig is a different kind of Bond, and I think he was getting some mixed reviews because viewers were comparing him to other Bonds rather than this film.This film is continuing the origins of Bond, why he thinks the way he does – he's a tougher, more somber Bond who at the beginning of the film with an exciting chase scene through Istanbul, gets shot off a train – and survives! (Hey, it's Hollywood, that's fine.) I liked this film. The action was fun but not over the top. The scenery was very nice – the Shanghai boat scene was lavish. The moody shadow & light show as an assassin gets his rifle loaded up and takes aim. (But why did Bond let the guy take a shot and kill his target? That's never explained).The Bond girls were tragic, intensely interesting and Bond's empathy for them was palpable.Enjoyed the back & forth with Moneypenny, as she shaves him closely. Later they discuss how it's easier to get dressed with an 'extra pair of hands.' Cute.Yay, we get a 'shaken not stirred' scene at a Shanghai bar, as Bond is watched closely by a gang of toughs about to kill him. We get a view of the Connery sports car, the Ashton Martin.Bottom Line: The film made fun of itself at several points, but true Bond fans would get the Easter eggs, and new viewers would be fascinated with the 'origin story' of our favorite MI6 spy, out in the Scottish Highlands ('Skyfall'). 'M' is basically our co-star. Bond is serious, has a lot of depth, and Daniel Craig plays him well. Good film.Cast: Daniel Craig - James Bond Judi Dench - M Javier Bardem - Silva Ralph Fiennes - Gareth Mallory Naomie Harris - Eve Bérénice Marlohe - Severine Albert Finney - Kincade",8,2,8,10 April 2013
Minority Report," Future Crime Thriller!
","I remember when Minority Report first came out and it improved with a second viewing of the future.The future is an interesting place; your advertising becomes personalized when you get eye scans upon walking into a store. Advertising is really expansive. And cars are automatic affairs running on rolling roads, reminiscent of Robert Heinlein's vision of 'The Roads Must Roll' story.Anyway, Phillip K. Dick (Blade Runner) came up with a short story adapted to film about a six year experiment called the Pre Crime Unit -- clairvoyants floating in a tank who together come up with an agreed-upon vision of the future -- a future where they can predict murders.The pre crime cops jump on the murderers as they're about to commit a crime, after all the trio psychics are never wrong. Or are they? There are people who greatly depend on this system and when John Anderton and a government agent stumble onto some anomalies in the system, they become targeted by these special interests.Spielberg spends a lot of time building up the Anderton character -- a man on drugs and greatly depressed on the disappearance of his son. And divorced from a woman who could not stand the reminder of her son whenever she looked in Anderton's eyes. Pretty sad.Lots of chases and lots of fighting with the occasional peak at the future make for some interesting science fiction entertainment -- but at two hours, wow! Tom Cruise and Colin Farrell both play their characters well though I would have liked to have seen more character development in Colin's character.Rental recommended!",8,0,0,27 March 2012
Oblivion," We make an effective team! Tom Cruise Scores on This One!
","THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE THEATRICAL VERSION.'Jack Harper: 60 years ago, Earth was attacked. We won the war, but they destroyed half the planet. Everyone's been evacuated. Nothing human remains. We're here for drone repair. We're the 'mop-up crew'. If you want to see a fun film with romance, excitement, plausible futuristic inventions, weaponry and computer-control, complete with Big Sister and the apparent salvation of the human race, watch this film.The film's beginnings concern an apocalypse of sorts, where in 2017 Man won, at a terrible cost, a war with an alien invasion. The remnants of that war, fought by the alien Scavs, want Jack (Tom Cruise) but not to kill him but to capture him. The cloud condo (I like to call it) has everything, complete with swimming facilities, showers, food and a hot red-headed, Brit-accented woman (Victoria) who also happens to be Jack's lover and communications officer. Every morning Jack goes out on patrol, fixes downed drones, and they complain to 'management' up in 'Tat', a large module miles wide, that is shuttling the last of humanity to its new colony on Saturn's moon, Titan. And every morning the communication from Tat asks , 'Are you an effective team?' and all hell will break loose if it's other than 'Yes!' Who could ask for more? There's more to the story than that. We are introduced to an apparency. And like Matrix, there is more than meets the eye and all is revealed, in bits and pieces, as the alien resistance, led by Morgan Freeman's character, Beech, is also not all it seems. Plots and Points:I won't reveal much, just to say the story will be familiar to many sci-fi fans. The action is non-stop (but it's not a military film), and the story slowly unfolds (but it's not Matrix). The plausible machinery (the dragonfly-like helicopter-ship with space travel capability) and Jack's cool, futuristic motorcycle are fun to watch and experience.The film's expostulation of what our world will be like is shocking – New York is completely wiped out. We have the library, subway system and the Brooklyn Bridge at hand. What sci-fi movie does NOT have the Statute of Liberty's arm up in the air, a common feature in these types of films since the Planet of the Apes!Best scenes: Getting your cycle stolen from aliens. I mean, that's really a shame! The humor as Jack catches that ball at the stadium, site of the 2017 World Series. And the hideaway that Jack keeps, a mountain lake and cabin, with remnants of humanity's technology (great Jazz vinyl) unknown to his partner Victoria. When a signal brings down Odyssey, a ship that's been in orbit 'pre-War', and one survivor, a woman who had been in his flashback dreams, completely destroys all the harmony and substance of Jack's world and sends him on a frantic hunt to find the truth or meet elimination at the guns of drones! Bottom Line: If you like your sci-fi with great scenes, seamless CGI and a constant plot with no pausing, then see this film. The film does take some concentration and if you're observant, you can follow along just fine. In fact I may get the DVD to fill in any points I missed. IMAX, was worth it!

Lawrence of Arabia," Great piece of filmmaking, but Lawrence's yo-yo behavior hard to imagine!
","First Thoughts: Lawrence of Arabia is one of those classics I've never watched all the way through and so I picked up a 2DVD series for a song on Amazon.com. Though it's rated as one of the top films of the 20th century, I was not that impressed. Story & Plot: Love the cinematography of this film! The amazing desert sunrises, the mirages, the authentic costumes! The crazy Arab played well by Anthony Quinn! The sleek Prince played by Alec Guinness! (Yes, he did many films before Star Wars); Omar Sharif as Ali, the only character who, somewhat violent, had to keep running after Lawrence and guide him.Peter O'Toole's Lawrence is a bit crazy. I mean here you are as a British soldier who nearly 'goes native', very independent, does his own thing, ignores warnings and crosses vast deserts and attempts the impossible.It's really sad, his character! Lawrence is one time a hero, fancies himself ready to walk on water, then next moment he wants to throw it all away, can't handle the responsibility of freeing Arabia and just go back to England to 'get a job'. I mean really now! He lets a mad lust for killing take over and mows down the Turks. Nowadays this film would push the PG rating since there's plenty of death for the even the most die-hard film fan.My DVD had a great interview with Steven Spielberg on how he was impressed by the film and how he met the director and picked his brains on the making of the film. Several documentaries and lots and lots of praise for the technical quality of the film.Final Thoughts: It's a hard film to watch, with an ending that is somewhat disappointing. How a man can rise so high and crash down so hard is tough to imagine. Excellent authentic desert scenes and a new look at Arabian culture; but the cons include Lawrence himself, a conflicted man who can't decide if he is just an ordinary guy or an extraordinary being.Worth the watch, won 7 Academy Awards, but I would not clamor for it!",9,1,3,11 January 2016
Super 8," Especially Great for Spielberg Fans & Baby Boomers!
","It's rare that a film comes along about kids and has a science fiction touch yet communicates the joys and the frustrations of growing up than Super 8.Super 8 was apparently billed as a disaster film with aliens, etc. In truth, it's not about the alien at all. It's about kids growing up in a rural town, trying to do something special with themselves.My Impressions: The film starts out with a funeral. A child loses his mother early on. A man comes over and is immediately thrown out of the house! Right here you wonder what the heck is going on! We find out soon enough. I think I found the story within the story of what Abrams was trying to do. It's semi-autobiographical. Spielberg and Abrams were both into making films as kids and it stuck.The actual filmmaking was fun to see: they set up with funky scripts, a zombie who just would not stay dead, and a kid who wanted 'production value' in all his shots! However, a train wreck, a fallen camera and an Area 51 scientist who also happened to be their science teacher changed all that.The train wreck special effects were amazing and horrific. The look on the love-struck kid when he thought Alice was dead was heart-touching.Favorite Scenes: Father's Faith: Without giving too much away, our hero discovers a film that was made with his mother when he was growing up. Alice sits with him in his room as the power comes on. The scenes project and Alice begins to cry, realizing that if her father took that shift at the steel mill that day, the tragic accident that took his mother 'should have' taken her father.The theme of dysfunctional parents that actually do love their children and overcoming that dysfunctional was great to see.Amateur Horror Film: During the credits we actually get to see the full film that the kids were making, right down to the pipe and the armchair, the zombie and the chemical plant, etc. Fun to watch! I actually did something like this myself when I was 17 or so.Music! The memories of the late 70s came back to me. The music and the excitement are really great.Hackneyed Themes: Yes there were some 'I've seen this before' themes of government abuse, secrets, abducting the alien (!), it escapes, the misunderstood scientist, the innocent children that make it right while the adults are clueless.But it's HOW Abrams and Spielberg put these themes together, with a few twists (the fathers' involvement) and the success these filmmakers did in recreating the time period, the attitudes, the 1950s horror alien invasion Grade B style, that makes this film so charming.Bottom Line: There are some scenes where the kids swear like truck drivers; it's not a lot but parents should know. Highly recommend this film, especially for those who grew up in the 70s, enjoyed Journey and Blondie, and loved the film E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial. The trailers make believe this film is a typical invasion story. That's done on purpose. It's a coming of age story that is charming in its execution. Highly recommended.",9,0,2,27 March 2012
Edge of Tomorrow," Edge of Tomorrow
","The Edge of TomorrowFirst Impressions:I've always liked Tom Cruise's science fiction films, from Minority Report, Mission Impossible I to Oblivion. In these he finds himself supporting one group or goal and having to suddenly change himself to counter-act a group or goal that is no longer survival and could mean his death if he continues on the path he finds himself. So he goes it alone, new, untraveled ground, to find himself and to fight the group he formerly supported. Not so with Edge of Tomorrow!Unusual for Tom's usual characters, he plans a PR man who encourages people to join the fight against the alien invasion that is rapidly taking over Europe and threatens to jump the Channel and England. Humans are losing and losing badly. It's clear not all the public relations in the world will save the planet from this implacable enemy, but Tom tries very hard to make it so. Until they call him in for active duty! He is a coward at heart and wants nothing to do with actual combat. After some interesting altercations, he finds himself on the battlefield, meets an alien called an Alpha, and almost accidentally kills it – and finds himself 24 hours earlier, lying on baggage in handcuffs, as he was the day before. Which is today. Of course. Plots and Plans:Really liked this movie! Not only the Groundhog Day-style living the day over and over, but in each incarnation trying to find a way to beat the alien threat. The aliens have time travel technology in their blood and know what we're going to do before we do it. Only Tom's character has the way and method of stopping them.He teams up with a soldier who knows of his ability and tries to use it to beat the aliens. The story is not so much about the aliens, but about the slow change of Tom's character – from a coward who wants to stay behind the lines to a man who realizes that only through his own actions will he stop a major threat to Man. Conclusion:Not to give too much away, but Tom's relationships with the people in this film develops well and the characters that support him run pretty well throughout the film. The army sergeants, the 'J Company' troops and others were a bit cardboard and not developed well at all. This could have been a five star film if I really cared about what happened to them. This is not your Dad's Groundhog Day! It's a plot point that carries with it a message of standing up to your fears and realizing your goals despite unimaginable odds. Great special effects! The ground swells with these aliens, look like spinning octopuses with large glowing eyes and can slice you up really well! Their weapons are energy balls that tear through the troop transports, that make hand-to-hand combat nearly impossible. You go to the battlefield of death! Except if you're Cruise – then you die again and again and again!A physical film, action and guns, heroes and inner enemies. A must-see film.Cast & Crew:Tom Cruise Cage Emily Blunt Rita Brendan Gleeson General Brigham Bill Paxton Master Sergeant FarrellDirected by Doug Liman Writing Credits Christopher McQuarrie ...
