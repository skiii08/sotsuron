The Avengers," Best SUPER hero movie!!
","All the best aspects of the Super hero movies of the last few years rolled into one to make THE BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE SO FAR!! The film gets straight to the point, LOKI steals the Tesseract, Avengers are called together and WHAM......Sit back and enjoy the fight/ride/thrill and Humour. Tony Stark adds excellent spark and quick one liners, just as he does in Ironman 1&2. Thor, Captain America and Hawkeye all play there part in taking down Loki and his army of aliens but for me the HULK is, for the first time in a movie, genuinely scary and fierce as he destroys almost everything in his path. The film really works as it stays well clear of any LOVE interest that slows down so many other superhero films. Black Widow is the female lead and she kicks butt with the best of them. All in all this is a brilliant film that is SUPERHEROS vs SUPER VILLAINS!! If that sounds good to you go see this film & then watch it again tomorrow!!",9,4,11,10 January 2013
Ted," So Funny & really good story!!
","What a brilliant film!! Got dragged to watch it & did not fancy it one bit from the trailers but was totally taken in from this crude, funny & great script!! The thought of a talking teddy bear sounds so un funny yet TED is played with such subtle and timing it works perfectly. A great story where a guy has to ditch his bum of a best friend for his girlfriend!! Some of the scenes are laugh out loud, the soap in the supermarket, the job interview, the fight scene all great and the relationship between Ted & Walhburg has so much surprising chemistry its amazing. This is a great film not really for kids under 15 but for all kids over!! How any one can score less than a 7 for this film is unbelievable! I score a 9!! Watch this film and enjoy!!!",9,2,6,1 September 2012
Friends with Benefits," Very very bad!!
","STAY AWAY!!! This is a terrible movie!! Neither a fun bloke joke film or a sweet chick flick......this is just so bland!! If you look at the cover, think to yourself two friends,like each other then don't like each other, then.......!!! You have it!! You could of written this film!! No twists, no originality &no comedy!! Sure the lead roles do provide decent eye candy for which ever way you look at it but that is the BEST bit of this movie and to be honest neither are as hot as they think them selves. First off as this young, single and very attractive couple meet it does nt even cross there minds they might actually fancy each other....no in stead they become best buddys, sharing beers and cracks and gossiping away until.........OK lets have sex!!!! Then we move on to trying not to like each other.....and even throw in the ever so charming doctor...........very bad bit!! In whole this is a turkey. Bad acting, very thin script, the obvious parts and the chilled out easy going, fun loving girl that suddenly flips over..........????? Please be warned this is poor! only if you are mad about Timberlake should you waste your time watching this!!",2,6,12,24 August 2012
Thor," Looks good but lacks conviction!!
","Thor looks the part, film is fun in parts and has a strong ending but just lacks real quality. The film starts of explaining how there has been a war for century's between the warriors of Asgard(Thors homeland) and the Ice Giants. Thor is to become king but his ceremony is interrupted by a hand full of these Giants of Ice, So to take revenge Thor and a 3 of his friends transport to the land of the ice Giants and destroy almost all of them!! A century of war yet Thor can kill 600 in 10 min??? Thor ends up banished to Earth. This seems to fail also, there is a huge lack of humour and the love interest is slightly boring!! Thor does return to Asgard and it is here the movie rapidly improves. The end of this film saves it from being a turkey. Thor is played well by Hemsworth and Hiddlestone is excellent as Loki but the rest of the characters are lacking, as is the acting of Natalie Portman.",6,0,3,10 January 2013
Tombstone," In top 10 of all time movies!!!
","To many people have not seen this film! This is truly a CLASSIC! If your a fan of Westerns, a fan of action, a fan of true storys or just a fan of great movies.....this is for you!! In an era when the change in laws on gambling and gun handling was sweeping across America, Tombstone was one of the last towns to be affected. Hench the reason all cowboys and harden gamblers moved in causing an extremely volatile town and ultimately the infamous GUN FIGHT AT THE OK CORREL!! Wyatt Earp is a legend that moved to Tombstone with his family and close friend Doc Holiday! Val Kilmer plays Holiday with unbelievable brilliance and wit in with out doubt his finest performance ever and Kurt Russel is excellent playing the tough Earp. This is a must see and see again!!",10,0,2,24 August 2012
