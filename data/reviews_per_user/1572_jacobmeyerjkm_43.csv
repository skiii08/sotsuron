The Avengers," Solid
","One of the better solid, entertaining Marvel movies. Unlike the new Star Wars movies, I can see that some heart was put into at least some of these movies and wasn't pure corporate cash-grabbing. I enjoyed the chemistry between each member of the Avengers especially in the final fight scene. While I think GotG and Iron Man are better movie, this is still a top 7 Marvel movie for me.",8,0,1,7 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It would be a 3, but Darth Maul. It would be a 5, but Jar-Jar
",Darth Maul is a damn solid villain to have. I just wish he didn't die like a lil' bitch. I was Jar Jar died like a lil' bitch. Seriously there isn't much to say about this movie that hasn't already been said. Negatives or Positives,4,0,0,5 February 2020
Iron Man 3," Better than Iron Man 2. But still in no way matches the greatness of the first one
","I liked the idea of taking away Tony's suits for a good chunk of the movie. It shows that he can do a lot with not a lot of materials given to him, just like the first movie. I, like many people, dislike the Mandarin and feel like it was a waste of both Guy Pearce and Ben Kingsley. RDJ was great and a love seeing him act.",5,0,0,9 February 2020
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Less limitations
","This is honestly a good movie. It has good acting, good actions, wonderful effects, and one of my favorite comedic actors Alan Tudyk. If you're a Star Wars buff who sticks to liking only the original trilogy, I implore you, check this one out",7,0,0,6 February 2020
Iron Man 2," I want... my B O R D
","Some see this as a crucial point in Iron Man's story. I see this as a waste of Sam Rockwell, Robert Downey Junior, Don Cheadle, Samuel L Jackson, Scarlett Johansson, and- wait why is Tony Stark in a Formula One race? This movie was all over the place and the only purpose it serves is to give Tony a new source of life.",5,0,0,9 February 2020
Thor: Ragnarok," FINALLY! A good Thor movie!
","This movie in three words: A good time. This movie always pulls me in whether it be with the action, the comedy, or the vibrant colors. They brought in Taika Waititi to fix this trilogy and God knows that he did. I love just even looking at the movie poster. I can't look at it and not smile.",8,3,9,6 February 2020
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Funny
","This is one of the funniest non-comedies I've ever seen. It has a lotta heart, humor, and emotion. It's not as good as Iron Man or Guardians of the Galaxy in terms of quality, but it's still a fun movie and a must-watch for any Spider-Man fan. Keaton, Holland, Downey, and Zendaya, were great as well as the supporting actors like Favreau, Tomei, and Batalon",8,0,0,10 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Definitely the worst of the trilogy, but a fun time
","As a kid, this was my favorite. But now, I feel as if this wasn't the best potential ending to I'd say the third best trilogy of all time. Perhaps, if they kept the same Vader/Luke plot but made the Battle of Endor less silly, then I would take this movie a lot more seriously.",7,0,0,5 February 2020
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Possibly my favorite action in a movie
","Anthony and Joe Russo showed that they can do action, direction, compelling characters, and a gripping story. This is my favorite Marvel movie after GotG, it develops both Natasha's and Steve's character as well as introducing a new character, Sam Wilson, in perhaps my favorite character introduction of all time. 9.3/10",9,1,1,7 February 2020
Doctor Strange," The most visually pleasing MCU movie
","Unlike the Star Wars Disney movies, I feel like there is actually some heart put into these movies. While I may be wrong saying that, at least these movies are mostly good and entertaining. Doctor strange has yet another great cast of actors with Benedict Cumberbatch, Tilda Swinton, Mads Mikkelsen, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong, and Rachel McAdams. It has a pretty iconic end fight scene which is odd for Marvel movies. I'd say the end fight scene in this was better than the one in End Game overall. This was more creative than a bunch of people punching each other.",7,1,1,9 February 2020
Interstellar," Best space movie since Star Wars
",These are the best effects I've probably ever seen in a movie. It's just so mesmerizing to get lost in the universe with our heroes. All other actors stole the show whenever they were on screen. Matt Damon had his best acting since the Departed in this movie and what can I say? It's just another Nolan masterpiece.,9,0,2,30 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Better than Phantom Menace, but only because less Jar-Jar. But also worse because no Darth Maul
","The dialogue is still ass, the action is still good (like the entire trilogy). Count Dooku and Jango are not threatening villains, and we see almost no character development except that time when Anakin kills the Tusken Raiders",4,2,4,5 February 2020
Forrest Gump," What to say that hasn't already been said?
","Hanks's acting is beautiful, the cinematography blows me away. My one miniscule problem is that I feel like this movie relies too much on making me feel for Jenny. Don't get me wrong, Robin Wright plays the part great, but I just don't like Jenny as a person enough to care about her.",10,1,1,28 January 2020
Ant-Man," Funny and emotional
","Paul Rudd is a talented, un-aging actor. He pulls you in with his charm and humor until you're entertained for a solid to hours. Luis might be the funniest character in the MCU and this may very well be the most fun MCU movie apart from Guardians of the Galaxy. While having yet another forgettable super-villain, it makes up for it by having great father-daughter moments, great moments among friends, and great maybe-romance moments.",7,0,0,9 February 2020
Captain America: The First Avenger," Another solid Marvel movie
","This is among my favorite superhero origin stories along with Batman Begins, Iron Man, and Spider-Man. Red Skull is a threatening villain with his morals shown well. Steve is a compelling hero with his morals shown well. This is good as a romance movie, an action movie, and a buddy movie. It doesn't deserve to be the lowest rated Marvel movie on this site. Age of Ultron does",7,1,1,8 February 2020
The Godfather: Part II," In some ways, better than the original
","Now this film is in now way more iconic are crucial to the film world than the first one, but it doesn't need to be. It has yet another gripping and compelling crime narrative. I loved the sets a lot better in this, which is natural seeing as they had a bigger budget. I loved the Robert De Niro storyline and was not expecting it going into this movie, so it was a pleasant surprise. This has perhaps my favorite ending to a film ever, and many end scenes that can compete but it's hard to get better than this one.",10,3,3,10 February 2020
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The start to a beautiful trilogy
","This isn't a film. It's an epic. If you ask 10 people why they think the Lord of the Rings trilogy is so brilliant, chances are you'll get 10 different answers. This trilogy has something for everyone. Friendship, action, a brilliant score, wonderful effects, an entertaining story, emotion, romance, bromance, betrayal... twice, world-building, and that's just the beginning.",10,3,3,2 February 2020
Batman Begins," My personal favorite origin story
","Negatives out of the way first, the action sequences are poorly shot. Okay now for positives. Perhaps the best rendition of Batman/Bruce Wayne. I like how they make his backstory known in the first 15 minutes because, come on, we all know his story. Neeson played 'Ducard' beautifully and Scarecrow might be my favorite villain besides the Joker in this trilogy. He had the aura of fear needed to be around him. 8.2/10 because action took up a lot of the movie",8,2,2,30 January 2020
Saving Private Ryan," Beautiful
","This is some of the best historical fiction ever put into film. Hanks, Sizemore, and Damon performed beautifully as well as every other actor's hard work put into this. This is perhaps Spielberg's most epic tale along with Raiders of the Lost Ark. It makes you just feel something else and is one of the best war films of all time.",9,0,0,1 March 2020
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The 2nd movie of my favorite trilogy
",This movie is the best LOTR film in terms of the feel of fellowship. This movie develops the characters most and all 3 separate storylines in this tie together beautifully and I'm am constantly hooked to see what ill happen next.,10,1,2,1 February 2020
Schindler's List," Oh ja
",This film hit hard as hell. First off: One of the best uses of color in movies. The only times color were shown in the film were the little coat girl and candle flames. This film is not easy to watch but the payoff is beautiful. My heart broke at the end while seeing Oskar (Liam Neeson) break down and seeing Itsahk (Ben Kingsley) trying to comfort him. It was beautiful just seeing what everyone went through in this film.,10,0,1,14 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A bit better than TFA but only because of Rian Johnson
","Rian Johnson is a very talented writer. One of his most famous works is the most highly rated television episode on Imdb 'Breaking Bad: Ozymandias'. I have a feeling this would have been a lot better if Johnson was given more freedom, but alas, he had to stick to the corporate churned-out story",7,6,21,6 February 2020
Guardians of the Galaxy," Best Marvel movie
","God I love this movie. I've started to like every Marvel movie a bit less, but not this one. This movie is great. Love Chris Pratt, love Zoe Saldana, love Michael Rooker. This is the one movie where they didn't have Drax be a walking joke and I enjoy that. He actually had personality in this. Best marvel movie 9.6/10",9,0,0,6 February 2020
Avengers: Age of Ultron," A joke
","This movie had so much more potential. Quicksilver's death was one of the worst deaths ever. It tried to make us feel for a character that we literally do not care about and the only true purpose it serves is to introduce Wanda and Vision and I guess build up Civil War, even though the events of the first Avengers movie could have done that.",5,2,3,7 February 2020
The Dark Knight," Entertaining as hell
","Some of the best action, acting, stories, grittiness, realism, and sense of danger in any superhero film. Despite being in a trilogy, this can also work as a solo movie because everyone knows the origin story of Batman, we don't need another one of those. This movie springs us right into the action with the first scene. The first scene is probably my favorite scene. Shows the true terror that the Joker can cause with a few resources. Ledger steals the show every time making me want to get back to scenes with him. However, this isn't to undermine the other actors. Bale, Gyllenhaal, Eckhart, Freeman, Caine, and Oldman all portray their characters beautifully. Just one of the best films of all time",10,0,3,28 January 2020
Pulp Fiction," Wh-What?
","What a great movie. Deserves all of the praise it gets. I might be saying this because I am a dude but this is one of the best movies of all time. Wonderfully paced, classic scenes, classic lines, and great performances from Jackson, Travolta, Thurman, Keitel, Rhames, Willis and not such a great performance from Tarantino. My favorite chapter has to be the Bonnie Situation purely because of Harvey Keitel as the Wolf.",10,2,3,28 January 2020
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Fun. But not on the same level as the original
","Kurt Russel was phenomenal in this, Chris Pratt was amazing, and don't get me started on Vin Diesel. Anyway, it's another standard, fun Marvel movie that's worth a watch to any casual movie viewer. Yondu's death had me in tears and I'd say it's the best executed death in any Marvel movie.",7,0,0,6 February 2020
Thor," Nah
","While I like almost every actor in this and the director, I feel like none of them gave it their all. Kenneth Branagh has much more potential, Hemsworth has much more potential, Portman has a lot more potential, they all do. The story was messy, with an unprompted laser robot all of a sudden just blazing New Mexico. It was confusing at times. I did like all of the family drama though.",5,0,0,8 February 2020
Joker," 8.5? Really?
","I give this film a 7.5/10 but only because the music, and Joaquin's wonderful acting. It was a good movie. I enjoyed a lot of the aspects of it. It contains a bunch of unneeded awkward scenes and I feel a good half of those scenes could have been cut. Yes we get it, he has mental problem. I'll admit tho, the end was one of the best scenes of the year.",7,1,5,8 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The best of the trilogy, but still not great
","This was a good end to the trilogy. I feel like Lucas kind of redeemed himself, but only because the other two aren't good. Fun action and a good ending. Other than that, It felt pretty lackluster",5,1,2,5 February 2020
Inception," Better than acid? Probably. More legal than acid? Definitely
","No THIS is how you do action Nolan. None of that Batman Begins nonsense. This might be the movie that got me into appreciating how films are shot. The camera work in this is god-like. Is the story a little hard to follow and straight-up a little confusing? Of course. I always try watching for the story, it gets a little to hard to follow for me about halfway through, I adjust to just enjoying the action and following the general story.",9,0,1,30 January 2020
The Shawshank Redemption," Great movie
","I'd say this is the movie that got me into movies. It got me into more of my favorite movies such as Taxi Driver, Inception, Pulp Fiction, and so many other great movies. Morgan Freeman has to be my favorite actor in it, not to undermine Tim Robbins whose performance was compelling and beautiful. It does a great job of humanizing criminals and it has one of my favorite antagonists in any movie ever, except maybe the Joker in the Dark Knight or Candie from Django Unchained.",10,0,0,27 January 2020
Parasite," Wasn't expecting this.
","When I hear the words 'A Korean film about class conflict' I think it's gonna be something stupidly pretentious and needlessly experimental. But no, this film is a masterclass in direction, acting, suspense, camerawork, beautiful scenery, and even comedy. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time especially nearer to the end when the stakes became extremely high. Not to mention, This film has the best montage I've ever seen in film. I did feel the peach thing was a bit stupid and it's dumb that it was a huge plot-point. Bravo Bong Joon Ho. 9.4/10",10,1,2,8 April 2020
The Dark Knight Rises," Good movie... but really?
","Look this is a good movie with some great action, good acting from Bale, Hathaway, Hardy, Oldman, and Levitt. I feel like Nolan saw that people loved when they put a lot of attention on the villain of the Dark Knight so he decided to do the same with this movie. But the thing is, Bane is nowhere near as complex and twisted as the Joker. Hathaway is a great addition but I feel like this movie had the potential to be a better ending to the trilogy. 7.6/10. Does not deserve to be in the top 100.",7,0,3,30 January 2020
Black Panther," Overrated, but a solid movie
","This movie has one of the best villains of Marvel. He is compelling, his morals are in check, and the hero even turns over to his side in the end. It has great performances, but the effects are perhaps the worst in any Marvel movie and it looked like a PS3 videogame at the end",7,0,3,10 February 2020
Iron Man," YESSSS
","DAMN! I was not expecting this. This is a great, well paced, well acted, Tony Stark Pissless, and well filmed story. The first act with Tony in the Afghan Cave is among the best parts of the MCU. Yinsen was a compelling companion. Obadiah was a threatening villain played beautifully The Dude himself. I rank this the best Marvel movie tied with Guardians of the Galaxy",9,0,1,9 February 2020
Thor: The Dark World," What the hell?
","This was made when Marvel movies were really hit or miss, and this was one of the last misses before Age of Ultron. They made almost all of the characters unlikeable and the villain? I don't remember his name let alone his morals or motivations. Just another forgettable superhero movie that no one really asked for. If you're gonna have a movie be forgettable, at least make it fun in the moment, y'know?",4,1,2,8 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," This movie in one word: Abramism
","JJ Abrams has a talent of making movies look amazing with wonderful effects. This movie has some good action, acting and effects. Other than that I can really see where the heart is in this. Is was made by Disney to sell more toys and merchandise to help expand their (often corrupt) empire.",6,2,6,6 February 2020
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A perfect end to my personal favorite trilogy
","What isn't great about this. This characters are developed wonderfully, the acting is brilliant, the epic effects blow me away, the score is perfect. This is my personal favorite of the three but mind you, it is an extremely hard choice",10,2,3,30 January 2020
The Matrix," Great effects but...
","This movie doesn't deserve to be in the top 250, let alone the top 20. Keanu plays Keanu and the other actors or sorta there. It's entertaining and by no means I dislike it. But holy hell this movie is overrated.",8,0,0,30 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The best of the saga
","Honestly, I prefer this over Empire. It's a fun, heartfelt, and well worked on movie with phenomenal direction, editing, dialogue (well maybe not that), action, humor (at the right times), and a start to one of the best trilogies of all time",10,0,0,5 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," To describe this movie. One needs only to describe Lando
","It's smooth, the dialogue is excellent, there are twists, and it's all around an amazing time that can united film buffs, nerds, casual viewers, and snobs alike.",10,0,0,5 February 2020
The Godfather," Best film ever
","I have no doubt in my mind that this film is crucial to the world of movies and the world in general. Every part was gripping, compelling, and emotional. I cared for every single character and felt for all of them individually. While watching this I placed sections into my brain for each character and started an emotional route for each of them. Even characters who seem as unimportant as Clemenza.",10,1,1,10 February 2020
