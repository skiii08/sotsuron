Skyfall," only good thing about this movie is a particular death
","let's see how 'Bond, James Bond'-ish this 'Skyfall' is.  1, 007 saved the world. not really, he tried to save his boss but  failed, when is last time 007 failed his mission?   2, Bond got his hot chick as always. wait a sec, who is the 'Bond Girl'  in 'Skyfall'? the only woman had romantic relationship with 007 is dead  in early part of movie. sadly enough, Bérénice Marlohe's performance is  one of few bright spot.   3, Cool gadgets and crazy car. Nothing fancy about Q's invention this  time and 007 hardly drive any car. why they want the bad guy blow up  Sean Connery's ride is beyond me.  list can go on but others already had pretty good summary, time for the  positive side.  First of all, let me say this, the death of M is a big ugly step  towards the right direction. If you watched old Bond movies, you may  recall M used to be a mystery boss who wont even show his face, then  recent episodes had 'her' becoming center piece of the story line. not  saying it derive the idea of making Mr. Bond as cool as possible, I  just cant see general audience interested in an iron fist old lady in  any kind of action movie, it doesn't matter how cool she is, oh, and  .... sorry to say this, but... Judi Dench is not cool.   Anyway, removing the element of M is a good corner stone for upcoming  007 movies, and the transition took whole 2 hours and 20 minutes. I  hope future release focus on that sharp dressing lady killer MI6 agent,  oh and a hot Bond Girl who can last to the end if you don't mind.",4,15,31,30 November 2012
The Matrix Reloaded," die hard Matrix fans will find themselves disappointed
","if this movie is not the second episode, I'll say Matrix Reloaded is a pretty good sci-fi action film. Cool fighting scenes, interesting storyline, eye-popping effects, I'll give 8 for this movie. However, if you love first Matrix movie, you'll somehow feel that you didn't see what you expect. and there're way to many unnecessaries. I am still wondering why the new operator family story, why half-naked dancing scene, why new agent, and it turn out that the movice tried to make a non-sci-fi story. I mean, come on, does people really have to understand where the Oracle came from, have to know why Agent Smith become a virus. and more disappointing is the ku-fung action somewhat indolent than original Matrix, it's more 1980s style if you know what those looks like. I'll give 4 to this bad episode, and I wish next Matrix back to track.",8,0,0,15 May 2003
