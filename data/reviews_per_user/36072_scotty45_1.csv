Lucky Number Slevin," So much for my happy ending
","So, going into this movie I expected nothing but spectacular cinema given the cast and genre of the movie. I was not at all disappointed for the first 1 hr and 45 minutes. However, when we find out that Slevin warned Lindsey about Goodkat coming to kill her....my attention turned south. I can understand the reasoning behind the writer allowing for some compassion to come from Slevin (basically following the footsteps of Goodkat when he didn't kill Slevin as a child), but it totally turned a 'badass' movie into a 'so-so mob-gambling' movie. It was basically like 'Casino' went on a date with 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Lucky Number Slevin' was their love child. I did enjoy 95% of this movie, but it would have left a much better taste in my mouth if Slevin and Goodkat had boarded a plane at the end of the movie, not thinking twice about Lindsey. The dialog and plot were too smart to have such a stereotypical happy ending.",8,1,7,17 April 2006
