Lucky Number Slevin," not just one twist
","I like movies with a twist and i don't like plain shooting and killing. To be honest, my friend rented this movie and i knew that it was something like low action that i don't like. Than i sat down and at the end i couldn't believe how stupid i was. The movie is hell good. In the beginning its gonna be a bit confusing, you're left to think why something is shown or why it happened but at the end all the pieces of the puzzle come together and you get a darn big puzzle with a twist following another twist, and another. Don't be scared by the many twists, the director did a great job to picture it so good that you definitely wont get confused. The acting is also very good, i always knew that Ben Kingsley was good, but he made himself many new fans with this one and seeing Morgan Freeman as one of the bad guys- its pretty new. While were on that, i don't think that this movie has good guys at all. Believe me, whatever you expect, you'll get more. See it even if you don't like twisted endings.",Null,1,2,2 March 2008
Requiem for a Dream," what a ride!
","OK, i admit, the only reason why this movie caught my eye was the original score by Clint Mansell, and i must say that the score gives a lot to the effects of the movie and the story, without it, it wouldn't be the same. Now to the rest, the movie is great, the directing is not as seen before and therefor it is a ride just having the directing. Congrats to Darren. The next thing is the acting and the characters. I don't know any drug addicts but, hell, that portrayal was more than great, congrats to all of them. Even the story shocks. Where there is no happy ending, there is something that will surely keep your thought fixed to the whole 'drug' thing. This is a great movie perfected by all the freaky and new way of directing. Its a must-have, not to mention must-see. Feelings pouring out of every act and a subject that shows you the bitter truth...",10,1,2,20 April 2008
Deja Vu," not really worth much
","i saw this movie NOT expecting much to see. As i heard critics and reviews that said how this movie mostly sucked. Now, when i started watching this movie i liked the concept and the idea. Denzel is a great actor but this movie was not for him. The first thing i hated was the name of the movie. It has no connection to a 'deja vu'. The movie should have been name d different. Another thing i hated was that the movie sticks to one story, one idea and than, by the climax, they risk all their existence and thats why the movie lacks reality and the story that goes after the big turn of the story just seems to go downhill. Im sorry to say that such a great actor as Denzel wasted his time on such a movie. The idea was also wasted. The only thing that stayed un wasted were the rest of the cast. They were not wastable.... they sucked anyway.",Null,2,4,14 April 2008
Unbreakable," a work of art, not entertainment
","A lot of people say that this movie is bad. Well, its one of my favorite ones. First of all, it does something Hollywood stopped doing a long time ago and that is to create art rather than entertainment. Its all about the money nowadays, how much a movie will spend and make. This one goes the completely in the other direction. Its emphasis is on the directing as a frame rather than directing action sequences and its more important to make the characters real through acting than through their actions. Its different kind of directing makes it interesting to watch. The scenes are long, filmed from angles that makes you think how the camera is just thrown into a place from where its filming. The dialogs are slow and it really tests your nerves. Be prepared for great acting and almost no action as you might be used to. The whole story happens through intense camera movements and dialogs. Its 'super hero' idea is nothing like other movies about super heroes.If you like art, this movie is definitely for you, but if you're in for the thrill and action, you'll get bored.",10,0,1,2 March 2008
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," pretty nice, funny and beautiful
","After chasing this movie I finally got it. FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL is not like other romantic moves you've seen, nor like comedies and its far beyond romantic-comedies (as far as I got it). So, you might expect laughs as god as those form $) YEAR OLD VIRGIN or romance and feelings like form KNOCKED UP but you'll get something in between- pulling more towards feelings. A few GOOD laughs, many moments that cause you to grin or just smile but many where you're just amazed by the seriousness of the movie. I mean, the thing was to picture the suffering and love and fun and whatever feeling and it succeeded pretty good. With great acting, a simple story and a variety of situations in which the characters find themselves, the movie offers something in the middle of escape from the real life and the real life itself. What am I saying? Go see thins movie, you'll like it. Bu don't expect too much, just a movie with a few laughs and romance and feeling puring from every angle.",9,2,6,2 September 2008
12 Monkeys," Nothing as seen before
","First of all, we know that Bruce Willis is a good actor but if you take the majority of his movies you'll see that the characters have these moments where they are the same. His character in this movie is far beyond every single one so far... and counting. The story begins in the (not so far) future where a man is sent to the past to find the source of a virus that has swept most of humanity from the face of the earth. The story seems to go towards SF but i think its closer to a drama because of the slow rhythm of the story. About that. Movies tend to be faster and slower at some points and develop more towards the end than the beginning but as you see this movie you'll be aware of this constant rhythm of story and revealing facts that does not speed up nor slow down. Its the one and the same speed that flows gently and pretty good. But that doesn't mean that the ending wont pull your nerves, cause its pretty good. As far as the direction goes, it is prefect. Movies as such are easily destroyed by bad directing but this one has become far better. So, if you are getting ready to see a Sci-Fi movie or some action, you'll miss it. B There should be more movies like this.",8,0,0,16 May 2008
The Girl Next Door," Its alright.
","What i expect from teenage comedies is nudity, fart jokes and people crashing into things and falling over. don't get me wrong, i like good movies, but i wanted to watch something stupid and relax and instead i got this movie, filled with emotions and touchy feely scenes. Its fun, there are memorable characters and the story goes pretty well to places unseen before. Its just not what you'd expect. I would have loved it more with a few more laughs and a story not entirely focused on two people madly in love and then painfully split up and then getting back together and all that. The cast was great, watching this movie after watching Into the wild really put my focus on Emile and i came to realize why he remained popular and re-cast as he is a pretty good actor. His love interest, played by Elisha is also a great cast- but so is the rest of the crew. Soundtrack fits perfectly into the scenes and is well done. To sum it all up- its a different kind of teen-comedy, more on the feelings and the stupid things kids do for love. I'm just to skeptic to believe in all of it. And i was hoping for a movie a bit more stupid and relaxed than this.",6,0,1,21 February 2013
The Day After Tomorrow," personal opinion
","Every one has their personal opinion about a movie but i think this one has the most different personal opinions. First of all, some would not be aware of the many things you consider in every movie. Like the dedicated parents, the stupid politicians, the all knowing scientist. The next thing is the message. Its about global warming, thats for shore but i don't think this movie is made to warn rater just to entertain, while other may think about global warming. The next thing are the special effects. They're good, they're really good and its worth seeing them but as they are the most important thing in this 'catastrophe' movie, they're not in the middle of attention. The acting is the ordinary one and please, i did it, but you don't do it - don't go read the 'goofs' section, there are a lot of goofs in the movie that will kinda spoil the reality of the situations. All in one, the movie is pure entertainment fiction full of new thing and things you see all the time, its not made to warn people of the impact of global warming. Watch it for the thrill, not the message.",Null,1,2,2 March 2008
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," A good, balanced action movie with real characters.
","I just saw Hellboy 2 after linking the first part and being a fan of Guillermo's work. I can just say that I love it and that its one of the best movies I've seen. And I'm not a shallow guy when it comes to movies. Its not about the special effects or action. For me, a movie has to have a lot of difference to offer. Hellboy is just one of those, considering the fact that the emphasis is on action and that there are special effect throughout most of the movie. Still, that does not mean that the movie doesn't have developing as well as interesting characters, a cast that fits perfectly into the characters and a story that concerns the main plot of the movie as well as the feelings and opinions of the characters. Now, add a few good laughs, great acting and a visual extravaganza and you'll get a good movie. Guillermo, the director and writer has proved that he is capable to make a movie with a lot of dedication and sacrifice since hes turned down so many offers because of this project. If you're a fan of the comic or if you liked the movie, you'll think the same as I, that this movie is great, if you're in for the action, your also going to like it and the effects, costumes and the many places the movie takes place are something you haven't seen before. Feelings of love, hate and friendship just pouring out of the screen while the directing leads you through a great story.",Null,0,3,2 September 2008
Cloverfield," a good idea and good concept
","The trailer freaked me out and so it did to most of the people, i spent days surfing trying to find out how the creature looks like and i must give them the credit for holding a darn great secret about it. And so i ended up buying it. The real reason is that i like when new things are tried out, so whatever the story was, id buy it if its filmed this way. Now, for the movie, itself, its a good one. Its suspense, and has moments that grip you. The camera movement (which the movie is all about) is believable and works good with the characters which are also pretty good. The acting was also pretty darn good. Now, the things that i did not like. But this is just because i manage to find a flaw in every movie i ever see. And these two mi gonna mention are those that worked for me and most people wont even notice it. So here goes, the monster is a bit to skinny, and funny looking. It doesn't seem fearful or whatever... than there are a few times when one or the other character tries to be funny and damn, it doesn't work if you're being chased through a big city bu i freaky alien monster. but as i said, you'll get past these thing without noticing them... its just me. Oh, and another thing. i don't think this movie will be a memorable one, but just one of those pretty good ones that you see once, and the second time they just don't work any more. So i saw the movie and ill sell my copy right away.",7,2,5,30 April 2008
Knocked Up," pretty realistic... not much of a comedy
","This is one of those movies you just don't know where to put it or what to think of it. Was it really good, or bad...? Well, the thing is here that the movie has a good idea seen many times before. you know- two people have sex and the girl ends up being pregnant. I've seen like 3 or 4 movies like this but its 'Knocked up' that will be the first one on that list. ('Juno' being second) A good touch is not just the clash of two people that barely know each other but she clash of worlds. You also might be pulled away form the main two characters and by the end of the movie you wont be able to know the difference between the main and the supporting cast. The humor is also something that must be spoken about. Its Seth Rogen who you laugh at and none else. Maybe its because the movie tries (and manages) to keep a serious impression and not end up being just another stupid comedy. If so, its good but still, Ben Stone (thats Seth Rogen in case you didn't know) holds all the funny lines along with his roommates while on the other hand all you get from the rest of the characters is seriosity. Now, YES, its a comedy but not just that. Its pretty good with a storyline hat you know how it will end but still, it has those little turns that make the road to the end of the movie unpredictable. So if you're in for a couple of laughs- go ahead, if you're in for a serious story- go ahead. If you're in for the action- nope... wait! Its a nice and balanced movie. Go see it, if nothing- you'll remember to put a condom on next time.",6,1,4,25 August 2008
Fargo," How enjoyable!
","I've caught a glimpse of Fargo on TV and i decided not to watch it half way through but really enjoy it from beginning to the end. And i loved it. The most amazing thing here are the always lovable characters. You're gonna commiserate with those who are lost and find sympathy in those most crooked. They are all well casted, perfectly played and most importantly real. the dialogue is what keeps this movie witty till the end. The little exchange of words between the characters is amazingly written. what starts off as a well thought out plan spins out of control very quickly but it wont catch you off guard. its a movie definitely worth watching for all its traits- writing, directing, characters, dialogue, the cold scenery. its one of those movies that leave you with a feeling of time well spent and art very much enjoyably consumed.",Null,0,0,25 March 2013
The Thing," What a classic, what a horror
",The Thing is one of the best movies that I've seen. Now the movie was made at times where CGI was totally unknown and that makes this movie even better. Make a remake of this movie using the latest special effects and you wouldn't get a movie that is so 'physical'. John Carpenter gave a lot to this movie and it really does deserve to be on the 'best 250 list'. Its far from all the 'already seen' even at those times and now and its beyond every predictable plot or stupid characters whose actions are beyond reasonable thinking. I bought this movie because i think its really worth to be in any collection and even more if you are a horror fan. Because if thats true you really should have the milestone of horror in your stash of scary flicks.,9,3,7,16 May 2008
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," a great, fun and entertaining movie!
","I remember when the movie came out. I wasn't much into it thinking that its just another comedy about sex and all that stuff thats just spouse to bring young sex-minded teens into the cinemas. So i avoided it and years later i ended up with the DVD. I sat down thinking the same but i was open for any surprises and yes- i was surprised. The movie is great! Starting from the cast, the movie isn't blinded by big names or by new names... its all in the middle with actors you might have seen before, or not. As far as the acting goes, its great and the cast fits perfectly with the variety of characters and that variety just adds to the freshness of the movie. The story- as shallow as it seems its well told with a lot of feelings and simple but still funny dialogs and situations. Its a great movie that I've seen many times since i first have and I'm gonna see it again- right now.",10,1,4,30 August 2008
The Graduate," a great piece of work
","This is an excellent movie, its slow and still keeps your thought fixed. The acting is great, but that because it was filmed at the time when bad acting did not even exist. I must admit that the only reason i saw this movie was because of Dustin Hoffman, i mean, i don't even know him as a young person. This movie was filmed almost 20 years before i was born. As i said, its a great piece of art and still, it stays fun and interesting. The directing is superb and some great lines keep you smiling for a while. Go and see it, its wort to be in a collection too. For those who love laughing out loud or action, skip it. There is also no real climax but as you finish watching it you'll see that the story skipped a brief intro and went to the main story right away, keeping it that way till the end.",9,0,0,14 April 2008
Space Jam," milestone of childhood
","This movie has defined generations. Kids loved it because this dude who was a good sports player got to play with these loony tones which is what the movie was all about. Its not about MJ, its not about Bugs Bunny, its not about a deep storyline or memorable characters. Its about fun and cartoons,which barely ever make sense, if you remember. Its great fun for the young folks out there, with animation that really is worth watching. Its entertainment for the entire family, combining real life with cartoons as its never done before. I love it, ill always love it. Looks like i have to add a few lines for this review to be accepted and posted. I really have nothing else to add, go ahead and watch it without expecting nothing more than fun and entertainment and you will get far more then you expect.",7,38,40,26 January 2013
Shall We Dance," good one if you want to chill
","Sometimes you're in for the action, you want buildings and cars to blow up, people to get shot and plains to crash. Rough dialogs, good looking girls and special agents. This movie is not nearly like that. Nothing big happens, no one ever gets mad and the story is pretty simple. Its fun at some point but you can see that romance is at the first place. The acting is OK, not too good if you ask me but just enough to get you through the movie. On the other side, the characters are interesting and you might find funny points in the movie. You might ask yourself what the outcome might me because of the relation between the characters so that the ending is not predictable. Like i said, after a long day at work, this movie will cool you down, give you a moment of rest, nothing more.",4,1,2,2 March 2008
Da 5 Bloods," This is not a Spike Lee joint.
","On the heels of his previous film BlackKklansman that came out when it was indeed relevant, Spike Lee tries again, and fails miserably. The movie opens up at a hotel reception in Vietnam and some very bad dialogue that's too on the nose and practically gives the viewer a list of things that are of relevance without ever contributing something meaningful or intriguing the viewer as to why these men are relevant and whats to discover. In the next scene the characters are at a bar, dancing, (or rather just going through a crowd like they know everyone) and then sit at a table here again their discussions are perhaps relevant, but badly executed and without offering anything of interest to even better know and understand the characters, let alone to contribute to the entire film. Their personalities are relegated to their political views which are expressed so forcefully, it would be absurdist if it wasn't just bad writing.
In a short flashback we see whats the point of all this. Some gold and obviously, a dead body, a fallen brother. What throws the movie off its course is mostly the age of the soldiers. They are depicted appropriately as older in our timeline and the same age in the Vietnam timeline. There is no effort to relate them to one another, just put them in both scenes, its going to make it easier, nobody will notice and move on. When movies are so condescending to its viewer it produces a mode that throws you off the story. Coupled with the one character meeting a Vietnamese woman who was a prostitute and now shes a well off lady with a daughter, whose father is the soldier and who never know of his now 30 y.o. child. And two scenes are given to this, which bared so much weight on the character but remained undeveloped (if you're by now capable of calculating the age differences here.
The scenes from Vietnam are shot in the aspect ratio we all know from Vietnam footage and it sort of adds to the atmosphere of another timeline, but the way these scenes are filmed is so poor, its almost laughable. Spike Lee should have known that action sequences are something else. No direction, no orientation, who is who is where is irrelevant. Again, it borders with the absurd, reminiscing about Classical Vietnam movies which depicted whites in the same battle and even poses and dramatic deaths which bare no weight considering what happens.
They find the gold, a symbol of power for one and of freedom for the other. As the story progresses one of these four veterans steps on a mine because he delivers a pointless speech that started from a meaningless argument. He walks backwards as he speaks, the camera anticipates a sudden moment, making us anticipate it and in the anticipation the message is lost and the scene where one of the soldiers is killed by a mine in a horrible fashion remains uneventful. Spike Lee fails continuously as a director of action sequences and he fails in anticipation building as well. Then the son of one of the guys steps on a mine and remains standing not to activate it. Some guys that deactivate mines just happen to be i the same region and they cant help them. Did I mention they work with mines? (turns out they barely have any weight int he story, not as a love interest or a way to propel the plot). They tie a rope around the kid standing on the mine and pull it, and he survives, because they pulled him away before the mine exploded. Did i mention there is no point or explanation as to why the kid is there and what kind of relationship he has with his father, a Vietnam war veteran who later gets killed too.
The movie is on on hand a miserable buddy comedy, trying to paint these men as fun guys. Their political opinions are given, never elaborated on. At no point does the film utilize film as a medium, as Spike Lee has done many times before. At no point does the film leave food for thought. It is a poor execution of a hastily written film. The only reason this movie was made was to be as timely relevant as Blackkklansman, which it would have been if it was not written in a day and made the week after. Someone should have looked at the script.
Its a missed shot because it is so bluntly served its almost insulting to the intelligence of the viewer considering its timeliness. In time the films rating will drop as people re watch it and those who actually disliked it can say so. Spike Lee, do not stop making movies. Let film do the commenting.",1,6,13,14 June 2020
