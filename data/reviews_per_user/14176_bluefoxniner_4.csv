First Man," Oh no...
","I thought this film would be amazing. Not much is known about Neil Armstrong. Instead you're left with an intimate account of the faces of the cast. Slow, boring, tedious and extremely laboured... I was expecting soooo much better than this bore fest.I wish I'd invested the time in enjoying Apollo 13 again. Unfair comparison, for sure.. but it is what it is.",3,4,7,9 February 2019
He Got Game," it's got game...
","don't be fooled by the 6.8/10 score on IMDb. I have no idea what sort of things people would find to score such a powerful film so low. It's not a sports film at all despite the heavy frame of basketball, but more of a film of love,family and the battle of deciding the struggle between head and heart. The film is readily accessible to it's viewers, and the subject matter whilst can be uncomfortable, is wholly believable. This is a film about life and choices, as well as redemption.This movie shines despite Spike Lee's need to scream black exploitation in every project he undertakes, and is a film that will provoke thought across all boundaries of race and colour for all peoples. Everyone should see this film at least once.",10,0,1,24 December 2010
Kick-Ass," One word too many in the title..
","Oh dear..Oh dear..Oh dear.what an awful, dreadful movie.i was expecting much more form such a great looking cast but got this drivel. The idea of a comic book hero in a comedy has great potential, but instead we get this rubbish.This movie is without identity, it doesn't know if it wants to be a comedy, it doesn't know if it wants to be a coming-of-age film, it doesn't know if it wants to be an action movie,it doesn't know if it wants to be a 'slasher' movie and the biggest disaster of all was that some of the comedy in it was funny.so, basically what you end up sitting through is sheer tedium and a bewilderment as to why they bothered making this movie.Kick as? they should simply delete the first word of the title for a far better reflection of what this garbage is about.",1,7,19,13 August 2010
Hotel Mumbai," One minor omission...
","This film portrays the savage terror attack in Mumbai with meticulous detail and some fine acting. This film is not for the faint of heart and is extremely difficult to watch when you realise that this ACTUALLY HAPPENED.For me, the raw terror of the event is captured in the visceral reality in which it happened, but my only niggle is quiet an important one.In the film, one of the terrorists ( the only one ) was actually captured. it would have been nice to see a back story leading to the instead of skipping it.Reading this review, it's clear that the majority of low voters are those who simply refuse to accept that Pakistan, as a nation, takes a great deal of pride in state sponsored terrorism. Most normal people are fully aware that Pakistan does indeed, facilitate terror whilst playing the victim card. Please do not be fooled by these low scores.In no way does this film deploy any Islamophobic or other political message. Take it for what it is..a very well filmed, extremely well acted, visceral account of a terror attack that is often overlooked.",9,14,41,7 June 2019
