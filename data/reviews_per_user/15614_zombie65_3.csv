The Blair Witch Project," Inventive and terrifying. Will spawn many imitations.
","With all the hype surrounding this new independent horror film, you might think it would be hard for it to live up to expectations. The Blair Witch Project is probably as scary as it's reputation. Feel free to read on, I do not intend to give away any of the film's secrets or surprises. The less you know about this creepy little chiller, the better.Filmed on video and 16mm black & white, this film is exactly what the horror genre needs in a time reminiscent of the early 1980s slasher onslaught. The Blair Witch Project has no knife wielding maniacs, no DNA altered monsters, and no real bloodshed onscreen. We see what the three film makers see as they make their way through the deep, dank woods in search of a legendary witch. There are times when there is nothing but a black screen, and all we can do is listen to their scared voices and the unexplained noises going on around them. The true horror behind this film is the unknown, and those dark places where you know something is lurking.If you are a seasoned veteran of the horror cinema, The Blair Witch Project may be less frightening than for someone who has not seen many scary movies. You will have to respect it's originality, and it's manipulation of our deepest fears. At times the film really makes you feel the sense of dread the film makers are experiencing. One thing I did notice about the audience in the theater is that everyone was very quiet. Except for an occasional gasp, the moviegoers were absorbed in this film. That's unusual for a modern horror movie. Most are full of fake scare tactics and multiple twist endings that keep the audience shouting and screaming at the screen. One thing for sure, you can expect many imitations of The Blair Witch Project in the future. Isn't that how it usually goes?",10,183,297,19 July 1999
American Beauty," An amazing American film
","American Beauty is one of the most original films to come out of Hollywood in a very long time. The story alone might carry some of the cliches that can be found in other movies, but combined with a unique directing style, a haunting music score,  and wonderful performances, this movie is destine to become an American classic in every sense.",10,0,0,28 March 2000
From Dusk Till Dawn," The Best Vampire Movie Of The 90s
","Not only a vampire movie, but also a kickin' action flick. The vamps don't come into play until about halfway through the film, but when they do..............watch out! An awesome story and not what you might expect from a horror film. A great movie, worth multiple viewings.",10,0,0,2 August 1999
