Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," a slight disappointment
","I enjoyed sitting in the theatre and playing cards for an hour while waiting to see the movie almost as much as watching the movie itself.   Not a good sign.The comments on this review site for 'The Phantom Menace' seem to fall mainly into two groups: 'Wow, a really great movie -- loved it all', and 'A few nice bits spoiled by many annoying items.' Put me in the second category.I'm a fan of the first three movies, but I don't think I'd see this movie again.  Why?Good stuff: Jedi action scenes -- the final fight between Maul, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan was the high point of the movie for me, and much better than any Darth-Luke fightum, gee, that's about it :-(Bad stuff:  Jar-Jar.  I was REALLY annoyed by this unfunny sidekick; why the heck did Lucas waste so much screen time on it?dialogue: lots of expository prose, setting up for the next two movieslack of character interaction: Amidala and Annakin were forced to emote towards each other, and it didn't work for methe digital effects were distracting, and didn't look as real as models. My wife and I agreed that all the CGI stuff started to look alike after a whileI didn't like the score.  The only piece of music that I enjoyed was Darth Maul's musicBottom line: I've seen the original films at least four times each, but I don't think I'll see this one again.  A pity.  I hope that the second and third films in the trilogy are better, but if Lucas directs them, I have little hope.  They will probably feature more CGI and more 'comic' characters.  Sigh.",5,1,2,19 May 1999
