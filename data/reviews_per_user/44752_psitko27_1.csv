Hereditary," Greatest Horror Movie Ever Made
","I'm dead serious. This slow burn horror movie is extremely well acted, well written, and well shot. I have no doubt this will go down as one of the greatest horror movies ever made. To the bad reviews that say it's 'boring' or 'bad', you clearly didn't understand it, or you're very impatient. It's beyond me how a fan of horror couldn't love this movie. It has everything! Highly recommend true fans of horror to see this.",10,2,5,21 August 2019
