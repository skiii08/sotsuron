Catch Me If You Can," Catchy if a bit overlong
","The premise of Catch Me If You Can is interesting to say the least. The Spielberg directed biopic is based on the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr who pulls of a series of breathtaking and unbelievable but nonetheless credible in their execution scams, and all before his 19th birthday.However this is also essentially the story of a young man who witness's his fathers business failure and consequently the break up of his happy family life, and accordingly sets out on something of a reactionary and desperate, but unattainable crusade to try and reclaim that which he has lost.Leonardo di Caprio, in a Michael J Fox eternal youth stereotyping role, stars as the teenager who is pursued over a period of years by an FBI agent played by Tom Hanks who is determined to get his man no matter what.The movie opens by setting the scene of the relationship between Di Caprio and his father, played by Christopher Walkin, whom the son obviously idolises. Early on we see Frank Abagnale Sr. being honoured by the local Rotary chapter but it soon becomes all to apparent that his success is not as it seems and in fact he is on the verge of bankruptcy and being pursued by the IRS for tax evasion. Things rapidly crumble leading to the Abagnale's losing their house and soon after the break up of the family when his Frank Senior's French wife leaves him for his best friend. Frank Jr, forced to choose between living with his mother of father, instead opts to run away and very soon realises an ability to graft and deceive people, more often than not women, based on his good looks, charm and, as he discovers, the awe and glamour in which the public hold airline pilots in 1960's America.Frank Jr. starts by breathtakingly impersonating a Pan Am Co Pilot which, more than anything exposes the gullibility and trusting nature of people before an age of air terrorism. Buoyed by his success and the relative ease in which he manages to carry off his assumed role, Frank's rapid learning curve combined with the necessity to keep ahead of the FBI chase leads him to further roles as a James Bond type super cool sophisticate, A Night shift doctor and ultimately a State prosecutor. All through this he keeps in contact with his father holding out the vague hope that he can get his mother and father back together and all will be the same as before and the nightmare will end. As his star continue to rise and his daring reaches new heights his fathers conversely falls as he ultimately ends up working as a mail man to make things meet.The most striking thing about this movie is how it develops each of the deceptions or roles he adopts, so that we start out finding it hard to see how he can carry off a role when he introduces the concept and yet as we are led through his deceptions the, ease and credibility of his performance and the naivety or unquestioning attitude of his audience carry us along and make us too see how he could have really pulled the trick.In the end the movie does stretch on a bit in its telling of the story and introduction of additional supporting cast of a love interest and her father played by Martin Sheen so that the end product runs well over 2 hours but if you think you might be on for sitting that long it's worth a look.",6,0,4,9 August 2006
Cast Away," Should have been called 'Survival' if only for the effort to get through it
","Cast Away strikes me as a movie that Hollywood decided predominantly to make to cash in on the huge success of the 'Survivor' type reality TV programs which began in the late 90's which, to me, seems a fairly lame and mercenary reason to make a movie. Of course it also gives rise to the natural survival instinct question 'what would I do if I was in his shoes?' and this however was a reason to approach this movie with anticipation.Much was made of Tom Hanks preparation for his role in this movie which at the time put him in contention for another Oscar - If he had won, then I think his main co star for much of the movie - a character called Wilson should also have received the award for best supporting actor.The basic premise of Cast Away introduces us to FedEx Problem Solver and Logistics Man, Hanks who at the beginning of the film in a typically condescending American way, enlightens both us and a pitiful crowd of Russian Fed Ex employees of how important time is and how 'we live and die by the clock' Meanwhile, while our hero Hanks is shooting round the world in air freight jets, his patient, and it seems long suffering fiancée Helen Hunt waits uncomplainingly back in Memphis, USA. Of course he jets home in time for Christmas only to be beeped off again on Christmas night leaving only the shortest time for exchange of presents before he flies off again promising faithfully to be back for New Year.Of course we know that he won't be.After the plane crashes our hero Hanks emerges relatively unscathed as the only survivor from the plane wreck onto a tiny volcanic island jutting out of an expansive Pacific with no population save for a few coconut and palm trees and the few Fed ex boxes that wash up on his private beach. Being a man of the modern world to whom time is of the essence, the survival instinct in our hero takes quite a bit of time to click in and even when it does it tends to manifest or reveal itself in the most basic, juvenile and pathetic of ways.Eventually Hanks begins to show a bit of initiative by utilizing what he can from the salvaged Fed Ex boxes, but even here on this futile desert Island, his illogical enslavement to corporate America and time remains when he retains one of the parcels un-opened so that he can deliver it 'some time in the future'.In at least something of a nod to other much better thought out 'survival type' pieces of literature and movies, Hanks sets out in a quest for fire and companionship.The companionship comes relatively easily in the guise of the aforementioned Wilson which manifests itself in the shape of a volleyball which bears a crude face when he accidentally smears it with his blood. His quest for fire of course is a considerably more involved and convoluted procedure.In that context, whilst it is very irritating, it's not altogether surprising to have the movie very suddenly jump on a whole four years, and to discover that, save for losing a lot of weight and growing a lot of very shaggy hair, our 'hero' Hanks has in fact moved on very little from his first few days. Indeed the growing incredulity of the film at this stage is further established when then, after four years, a piece of a Portaloo washed up on his island suddenly seemingly overnight finally inspires Hanks to try and get off the island.His survival instinct and initiative which seems to have little progressed or developed in the intervening four years then suddenly kicks into gear again and he does display some encouraging enterprise in building a raft from logs and video tape and a rope which we learn he'd contemplated to use in his suicide sometime in the four years (It could have been a much better movie if we'd had more time to find out the specifics of why he didn't).Of course it's no real surprise to reveal that he does succeed in his escape and is delivered into his rightful place back in the civilized world again, though in another bit of appalling continuity his undoubtedly required psychological and physical rehabilitation is compressed into a simple and casual but very irritating 'Four weeks later' flashed across the screen.Back in the real world however, life and also unfortunately, his fiancée, has moved on, so Hanks is confronted with a new set of realities, in addition to the added trauma of merely trying to readjust to normal life. Of course, out of its more comfortable and familiar setting on the island, the movie again begins to lose its way and even threatens a sickly sweet Hollywood ending but even fumbles that ball and ends up pretty inconclusively really which the malicious or cynical part of me might speculate could have 'Sequel' or 'Prequel' or even 'Interval - The intervening four years' written on it.This was one of those movies that had its wonderful potential most irritatingly buried by getting such things as too many story lines and a striving towards 'Oscar status' again for Tom Hanks get in the way of writing a concise and tightly knit story of survival in the face of awful odds and more especially the psychological effects of loneliness and isolation and a study of the primeval instincts of survival in man. This movie only briefly flirted with any of these subjects and if it had even chose to concentrate on one of them it could have been great.",4,0,2,9 August 2006
The Hurricane," Excellent portrayal by Washington
","The Hurricane is an inspiring biopic of Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter whom I had only brief previous knowledge of, predominantly through Bob Dylan's excellent narrative song 'The Hurricane'.Denzel Washington gives a sterling and Oscar nominated performance of Rubin Carter over a thirty year period, from his initial youthful run in's with a vengeful, grudge bearing and corrupt detective, through his boxing career and his bid for the world middleweight boxing crown followed by his framing and long imprisonment for a New Jersey bar room triple murder.Rubin Carter was one of those cause celebre's a la Nelson Mandela, The Birmingham Six and The Guilford Four all of whom attracted considerable public attention, high profile personalities and a series of failed appeals which, it would seem if the movie and Bob Dylan's song are true, if they were to succeed would have meant exposing a deep rooted racism and corruption within the New Jersey police and the judicial system that went right to the top.Even within the movie itself, the point is made that even though Rubin's cause has managed to gain attention and many high profile supporters including Muhammad Ali and the aforementioned Dylan, very few have really managed to stay the course and stick with it doggedly over a twenty year span which has seen the failure of two appeals and even a biography penned by Carter within prison ('The 19th Round') laying out his claim for innocence and the trail of events that got him to where he is.It is out of this biography, long discarded and battered and published so long ago that it's been forgotten by most, that Reuben's hope for clearing his name is reawakened, in the hands of a barely literate young black refugee from the Bronx called Lesra Martin who has himself been taken under the benevolent wing of a threesome of somewhat idealistic, hippyish, but well intentioned Canadians in Toronto. Lesra chooses the battered volume as his first ever book purchase attending a used book sale with his Canadian friends. In another parallel, right from the start, Lesra finds similarities and something of a soulmate in reading about the life and fate of 'The Hurricane'. Eventually the story so inspires and motivates young Lesra that he kick-starts a new campaign to get Rubin freed and succeeds in enlisting the help of his Canadian friends to do so.Admittedly, whilst the goodie goodie and over idealistic, even bordering on sinister, intentions of the Canadian threesome are at times somewhat unbelievable (They live in a sort of a threesome commune, surviving apparently quite comfortably renovating and selling houses, have plucked a young black kid from the streets of the Bronx and out of the grasp of his alcoholic parents, merely because they believe in him and feel he 'deserves a chance' in life and NOW, along with their young black friend, they uproot their lives to move from Toronto to New Jersey 'for as long as it takes' to prove Rubin's innocence) yet there is quite the air of realism in aspects of the difficulties and dilemmas they encounter such as the harassment (apparently very much truth based) they get from senior forces in New Jersey, but most significantly during their first visit to Rubin in prison. Indeed this is one area of the movie that pulls no punches and doesn't attempt any major makeover of Rubin's character. The Canadian's are subjected to his full wrath and venom and all the hateful spewing of an oppressed black man that has through experience come to hate all white men and everything they stand for. Of course his character isn't overtly polished or sanctified either. He has had his brushes with the law, all be it, if we are to believe the film at least, unprovoked. His swaggering, intimidatory ways and arrogance (though he terms it 'pride') and indeed his real life temper are touched upon at least, albeit minimally most notably in a scene where he meets his future wife. However even with all this, Washington's portrayal of the Hurricane is so touching and sympathetic that one does come to respect and like this guy and to feel really sorry and angry at the way he has been wronged.Possibly the major achievement of this movie is its documentation of one mans near descent into madness and total despair when the only way he can survive in the end is to retreat deep into himself and completely shut off the outside world. It is a credit to the talent of Denzel Washington as an actor the way he carries this portrayal off so convincingly. However whilst it may take all of his inner composure to survive and stay sane, it will take much more and the efforts and perseverance of others outside to prove his innocence. This is essentially what the last third of the movie deals with and similar to other 'based on a true story' movies it has attracted some criticism of how events and incidences were condensed and manipulated to suit the plot and lead to the desired outcome.That aside, this is an emotive movie about major miscarriages of justice and the necessity for perseverance of hope within utter despair and indeed for perseverance full stop.I also particularly liked the sound track of this move, which predictably enough featured Dylan's song along with some other jammin' tracks particularly the one about 'the revolution'.Finally as a point of trivia, this movie stars one Clancy Brown, reprising his role from Shawshank Redemption as a prison guard, all be it this time a sympathetic one who treats Reuben with the respect and dignity he desires right from the start, as opposed to the brutal figure he played in Shawshank.",7,0,2,9 August 2006
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," Loach casts an excellent social focus on Ireland's troubled history
","This film has provoked considerable debate here in Ireland in addition to the somewhat unfair and misguided controversy elsewhere especially within the UK media.To me probably the biggest tragedy of this particularly harrowing period of Irish history was not especially the atrocities carried out by the Black and Tan British Mercenaries on Irish civilians and replicated back in kind by IRA flying squads, but rather the fact that when all this was over, then the two opposing factions of Irish, pro and anti treaty turned on each other with a ruthless matching and even surpassing that which they had targeted the British with previously.This has been hailed in some quarters in Ireland as an accompanying balancing piece of cinema to Neil Jordan Michael Collins. In truth, whereas Michael Collins sought to package the story in a nicely accessible and embraceable to all summary, complete with a romantic interest in the form of Julia Roberts, TWTSTB pursues a much more gritty trademark Loach realism on a wider theme of social issues and morals. It is this feature of the film that helps it rise above the mere story of a period of Irish history and offer an insightful social commentary for our times for those that care to look for it and don't allow themselves to be blinkered by questions of history.There are parallels to be drawn from this movie to the current situation in Iraq and all the other Imperial incursions in war zones of the 21st century. There are legacies hinted upon in this movie which persist to this day in Ireland: when one of the characters foretells what the treaty will mean for the Catholics of the 6 counties of Northern Ireland or that the proposed boundary commission encompassed within the treaty is merely a ruse and that it will never be fully explored further. Or more pressingly in the light of the current impasse between Big Energy Corporations and residents of the West Coast over Gas, where one of the characters proclaims that freedom for Ireland should mean much more than mere freedom of the people but ownership of the land and all its resources by the people and for the people.There are parts of this movie that are truly harrowing and the movie as a whole could certainly not be described as particularly uplifting or happy in any way yet within it there are some moment of intensely observed beauty. At varying points the movie brings into focus the personal dilemmas of a doctor turned IRA gunman and a British Army officer surrounded by men driven mad and out of control by their experiences from the slaughter on the Somme battlefields, both perceptive enough to realise the line that they have crossed.True there are unpleasant scenes involving British Auxiliaries (The dreaded Black and Tans) out of control and truly obnoxious towards the Irish but the accuracy of these scenes can be confirmed by thousands of eyewitness accounts of the time and by the legacy or towns burned by the Black and Tans in reprisals. Equally similarly brutality is shown and portrayed by the IRA flying columns in their summary executions and ambushes, albeit even if most of their intending victims are portrayed in a less than favourable light prior to their demise, as if to somehow make them more worthy of their fate.There is also a brilliant portrayal of the chinks already appearing in the Irish side even while they fight the Brits, where two very different ideologies are developing who will ultimately turn on each other with neither really emerging victorious or unscathed but both of which will dictate the pace and economic deprivation to come for Ireland from which she will only eventually emerge in the 1990's when the so called Civil War politics are finally laid to rest.As an insight into this period of Irish History and an accompanying piece to Neil Jordan's 'Michael Collins' this is a wonderful piece of film making. But it is also a wider social commentary on the dangers and price of Colonialism and Imperialism at any cost which those nations trying to impose their will and norms on another to this day could do to take note of.",8,2,4,8 August 2006
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," But is it as good as the book?
","Of course like all paper to celluloid projects this movie was inevitably going to pose the question 'but is it as good as the book?' but with JK Rowling firmly in control and overseeing the film production it was to be expected that she would push for authenticity in any case. It is still likely, however, that many die-hard Harry in print fans who have their own image of how it should have been will still say 'not near as good as the book'. But that is possibly more so a reflection on the delights of reading and how the imagination can conjure up an image in ones mind as opposed to being a criticism of the film.Inevitably of course elements of the book had to be sacrificed for brevity to make a movie that could retain the attention span of children - and even still it comes in at a considerable 2 hrs and 32 minutes. It still does manage to convey the core parts of the book admirably though and indeed it is said that, such were they complexities of aspects of the plot and location, it would have been very difficult to do just credit to the book without the advances in digital editing of the past five years. In that context Harry's School of Wizardry, Hogwarts, is portrayed exactly how you imagine it should be and even the Wizarding Game of Quidditch, which is basically like an airborne cross between seven a side soccer and basketball played on broomsticks with four balls, is portrayed quite well, though this is possibly one area where an over-dependence on special effects and high action (excuse the pun!) didn't exactly equate with what I had conjured up in my own head from the book. The casting is also rather inspired. Daniel Radcliffe quite simply IS Harry Potter. Richard Harris, as Headmaster Dumbledore, sports a beard even wilder looking than as the Bull McCabe if that is possible. Robbie Coltrane is excellent as the unkempt giant caretaker of Hogwarts; Hagrid and it seemed almost inevitable than no one but Alan Rickman at his super evil best could play Professor Snape, Harry's nemeses at Hogwarts.And so for those rareities who have never heard of Harry Potter  What of the plot? Basically young Harry Potter is something of a prodigious celebrity amongst Wizarding folk for surviving an attack from 'You know who', otherwise known as, but seldom called the arch evil dark Wizard, Lord Maldevort, who killed both his parents when he was only one year old. Afterwards Harry is doomed to live with his very nasty muggle (Wizarding Folk Terminology for non wizards) aunt and uncle and cousin for the following ten years, knowing nothing about his wizardry, until he is finally rescued by Hagrid on his eleventh birthday and brought to Hogwarts school of Wizardry to begin to learn his trade. The film thereafter basically follows the adventures of Harry and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermoine Granger during their first year in Hogwarts.And so to the verdict? I found it a highly entertaining and quite inspired adaptation of the book; admittedly with some flaws, but I'd still grant it 7/10.",7,0,1,9 August 2006
Enemy at the Gates," A good but not great war movie
","The best war movies in my humble opinion are those that endeavour to show it exactly as it is, i.e. that however much Gung Ho or patriotism or brainwashing or propaganda is involved and no matter how it is glorified and even how it does indeed sometimes make heroes of otherwise average and relatively insignificant men, war is hell, plain and simple! For anyone even vaguely familiar with the history of the Second World War the name Stalingrad towers head and shoulders above even Normandy, Iwo Jima and The Battle of The Bulge in sheer carnage. The movie 'Enemy at the Gates', directed by Frenchman Jean Jacques Annaud (Seven Years in Tibet, The Bear), sets out to tell the personal tales of some individuals, both Russian and German in a much more focused account than the last movie of note to address the subject, the sweeping German production 'Stalingrad' from 1993.In 'Enemy at the Gates', Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law) is a young peasant from The Urals who is befriended shortly after his arrival into the horror of front line 1943 Stalingrad, by a Soviet propaganda officer, Commander Danilov, played by Joseph Fiennes, who, after witnessing first hand his prowess as a sniper in assassinating five German officers, sets out to elevate him to the status of hero in a bid to raise the spirits of a demoralised Red Army, who are battling to hold the last tenth of their ruined city against the German onslaught. To witness the graphic horror of how these two are thrown together at all, it is easy to see why 20 million Russians died in The Second World War. Arriving by train at the rail head across the Volga from the city proper, Zaitsev is fed into the mincing machine that was the Second World War's Verdun, along with his 'comrades', where the instructions from the commanding officers, since there aren't enough rifles to go around is, 'follow the man in front of you until he is killed and then take his rifle'. This, along with those retreating being machine gunned down by their own officers as cowards and traitors to The Motherland is, it seems, what goes for motivation in besieged Stalingrad.It is upon this opportunity, therefore, that Commander Danilov seizes, to sell his motivational hero idea to the field commander, one Nikita Krushchev, played quite excellently by Bob Hoskins. The plan is wholly embraced by Khrushchev and before long Zaitev has become a legend, receiving fan mail from Factory Workers and Coal Miners all over the Motherland as his ever increasing German officer kill tally is daily reported. Indeed so successful does the legend of Zaitev become, and so counter demoralising for the Germans, that they dispatch an ace sniper of their own, one Major Koenig (played by Ed Harris), to Stalingrad to hunt down and kill Zaitsev.This is the main preoccupation of the rest of the movie, apart from a parallel subplot, the female love interest, of a female sniper Tania Chernova, played by a strikingly pretty Rachel Weizs, whom both friends fall in love with, which understandably leads to major jealousy, particularly on the part of Danilov and puts a major strain in their friendship, as they fight their own little battle for her affection within the claustrophobic ruins of the city.The battle of wills and wits of the opposing snipers is gripping, particularly in the way they track each other and try to anticipate each others thoughts, and other methods (In Koenig's Case, the enlisting of a young Russian boy, Vasha (Gabriel Thompson), by chocolate and food bribes, who though he worships and idolizes Danilov, yet feeds Koenig information about him, perhaps in a bid to entrap the German, as he also relays information back to Danilov and Zaitsev about the German and his whereabouts) In any case, whilst the hunt it is filled with suspense, in the end it does become a bit drawn out and makes the movie perhaps a half an hour longer than it should be.Apart from some of the dramatic failings of this movie, it does manage to portray a horrific and realistic picture of the tragedy of war, and like all great anti war movies, if it achieves nothing else but this, then it can be justifiably deemed a good movie. It is however not a 'great' war movie up there with 'All Quiet on The Western Front', 'The Great Dictator', 'The Red Badge of Courage', 'The Longest Day', 'Platoon' and 'Saving Private Ryan'.",6,0,1,9 August 2006
Gangs of New York," Cross between Goodfellas, The Mad Max series and Moulin Rouge with a bit of Braveheart celticism thrown in for quaint appeal.
","I went to see Scorsese's flick without being entirely sure of either what to expect or what, beyond the title, it was even really about. On reflection the best concise description I could come up with would be something like a cross between Goodfellas, The Mad Max series and Moulin Rouge with a bit of Braveheart celticism thrown in for quaint appeal.In a nutshell, the movie is a loosely historically based look at the New York of the 1860's during the civil war when the local established gangs fought for control of the city with the hoards of Irish arriving in their thousands escaping the poverty and starvation of the old country. In that context the film boasts quite an array of Irish talent ranging from Liam Neeson (Making a relatively early exit) and Brendan Gleeson to the unlikely appearance of Finbar Furey and Maura O'Connell (Both funnily enough playing singers!!). The main characters in Gangs of NY however are Bill the Butcher, played brilliantly nastily by Daniel Day Lewis and his opposite, Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) the second generation Irish son of a Kerry 'priest' (Neeson). The film begins with Amsterdam as a child, witnessing the epic street battle at the five points area of New York, between the Catholic Irish conglomeration of gangs led by his father's Dead Rabbits and the opposite collection of Anglo Saxon Native Gangs led by William 'Bill the Butcher' Cutting. After the defeat and outlawing of the Dead Rabbits and the murder of his father by Bill, the action jumps forward some sixteen odd years to Amsterdam's return from a reform house (Hellgate House!) for revenge.Following the Trojan premise that it is easier to defeat your enemies from within Amsterdam works his way into the upper hierarchy of Bills gang, ingratiating himself with Bill and even falling-in finally, after initial discord, with one of Bill many discarded mistresses, Jenny Everdeane (Played by Cameron Diaz). Of course all this is to one end, to ultimately avenge the murder of his father when the opportunity arises.Day Lewis is great in the bawling, flamboyant, even overstated (ala Brando's Godfather) portrayal of the butcher - a horrendously cruel man who, at one point in the movie, describes for Amsterdam how he maintains control over the Five Points by sheer fear and retribution.The strange thing about Gangs of New York however is though it's set quite evidently and topically in civil war New York, during riots which erupted in supposed protest against the drafts of soldiers to supply the ranks of the Union Armies, it is almost futuristic in its portrayal of The Big Apple. In that context one can't but wonder what influence its development in the shadow of September 11th 2001 played both in Scorsese's vision of a decimated anarchistic New York and also something of a homage to what created the city in the first place and what helped it recover from that day. Certainly hats are tipped and credit (thought, in some aspects of the portrayal, not altogether complementary) or acknowledgment is made to the integral role the Irish played in the development of both the police force and Fire Service of NYC. Again and again one is drawn back to subtle references to 911, even in the conclusion, as a historical panorama of Manhattan from across the Hudson pans the skyline which develops over a series of photographs scanning 140 years and ends with a still standing twin towers nestling among the rest of the skyscrapers that now cover the same streets as The Paddies and The Nativists held sway some 140 years ago.Gangs of New York is an interesting film - I'm still not entirely decided if it's a great one but it's certainly entertaining. It is violent but considerably less dependent on blood and gore than Braveheart or Gladiator. I would say too that the big screen does justice to its sprawling historical panorama and a subject matter which has been somewhat diplomatically airbrushed out of conventional American History.",Null,0,1,9 August 2006
Braveheart," Rollicking historical action movie that fires up the blood
","I remember coming out of the cinema after first seeing this film back in 1995 and being so fired up and just enthralled by it. It may in part have been because of the Irish references and the Irish connections and to note that the Scots weren't all that dissimilar to us Irish in celebrating getting one or two over on the ole English oppressors.Yesterday I visited the Wallace Monument on Craig Abbey in Stirling overlooking the battle site of Stirling Bridge and just had to re watch it when I got home.Of course Randall Wallace, as well as being responsible for some subsequent awful clangers, most notably Pearl Harbour, took some considerable poetic licence in stretching the fiction of Wallace's life to its very limit and even beyond, but considering that little it actually known about very much of Wallace's life beyond what has been based on Blind Robbie's poem, he succeeded in weaving a powerful and inspiring and both uplifting and harrowing story of the man, who probably more than any other, still lives within the hearts of Scots more than 800 years on.Possible Spoilers: Of what we do know of Wallace's life, well of that presented in the museum in the Wallace Memorial in any case, is that he was the son of a very minor Scottish noble, he was educated in Latin and French probably by one or two of his uncles who were priests. He had a disagreement with some English soldier/occupiers while he was apparently fishing and had to go on the run and, the English, in trying to get at him did burn down his house with his wife inside and he did revenge her murder. He did achieve a great tactical victory over a superior English force at Stirling Bridge which was achieved more by the nature of the swampy terrain and the narrow bridge than by what is depicted in the film as a battle on an open plain with a cavalry charge defeated by pointed sticks. The English were supposedly shocked by the savagery of the Scots who systematically slaughtered all the injured English on the battlefield and it is alleged that Wallace himself had a sword belt made from the skin of the English commander of the battle. He was betrayed by the rest of the Scottish nobles at Falkirk, who refused to lend him their support. Robert the Bruce's father did have leprosy which Robert himself ultimately also succumbed to. Wallace never did meet the Princess of Wales since he was dead three years before her arrival in England and Edward de Longchamps outlived Wallace for some three years also and whilst Edward Prince of Wales may have been exaggeratedly or misleadingly portrayed as an exteremely camp weak prince, there is considerable evidence to indicate that he was a homosexual, this in spite of producing a number of offspring with his French wife including Edward III, who ultimately overthrew him with the assistance of his mother. However, if all these hard facts had been adhered to too rigidly would it have made for near as good of a movie? I don't think so. There are a number of excellent scenes within the movie, most notably Wallace's visit to the English military camp to revenge his wife's murder, The Freedom speech before the battle of Stirling is probably one of the best in movie history, all the battle scenes are magnificently if gorily realised and the final execution scene is both graphic, harrowing and inspiring and overall the graphic gore developed within this movie was ultimately to become Gibson's trademark and that which was to invite so much criticism in The Passion. This is a truly inspiring film, perhaps not entirely nor anywhere near historically accurate, but in terms of large scale entertainment and the realisation of a vision in cinema it is a great achievement, right up there with Spartacus and Ben Hur, and well worthy of the recognition it received.",8,3,6,8 September 2008
