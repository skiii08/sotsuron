The Perks of Being a Wallflower," In My top 100 movies of all time
","So as you can tell by the title and the stars I really enjoy this film. It's top 100 for me, I'm going to read the books this is based on and I'm getting a tattoo of it.. yeah crazy I know, but here's why.Acting:
The cast in this film is so delightful and they are all equally unique and interesting will real problems and real emotion. Everyone has a story, a problem and a relationship which you just get sucked into caring about.Cinematography:
The shots are all great and have plenty of meaningful scenes with foreshadowing and symbolism. A real joy watching some scenes.Story:
This is obviously based on a book and similar to the Harry Potter books I believe this one is replicated well. I love all the characters and quirky scenes they have as well as the sweet/emotional scenes that leave you immersed in the story and relating from real life expierences you may of had.Summary:
Overall I would highly recommend this film if you enjoy dramas or character driven stories. It's a real treat and in my opinion one of the most compelling movies out there.",10,1,1,26 February 2020
Wayne's World," It's okay
","Acting:
Of course the classic characters for some of mike Myers and Dana carvey playing two goofballs. They do well at making these characters who they are. They're similar to that of dumb and dumber and I really can't complain.Story:
Here's where I find it not that great. It's a movie that has 0 seriousness and breaks the 4th wall constantly. That's fine except the story is just really bad, cheesy and being funny is no excuse for bad writing. There are funny moments here and there. Some are a bit too goofy and unfunny but overall that's not the main issue. The issue is that it's hard to enjoy and expierence a movie when the story is pretty boring. This would of been great if the story was just as good as the characters.Summary:
Now overall I think this movie is only for a particular group of people. Otherwise I can see someone hating this or someone loving this. If you like stoner films or just goofy comedies than you should enjoy this. If not i would give this one a skip.",6,2,2,23 May 2020
Captain Marvel," Very fun and refreshing
","The 90s throwback to introduce how marvel started was really interesting and cool to watch. One of the reasons I dont like avengers is because of the horrible overly used CGI for everything. This movie is nice to watch and very new and refreshing.Acting:
The acting was good, very good charicterisation and explanation for each character. They all have interesting personalities too.Cinematography/effects:
The camera shots were good as always. The CGI was actually pretty good, especially when I hate the crappy CGI in avengers. However in this film, when she is flying in space it looks kinda bad, but otherwise good.Story:
The story was very fun and interesting to follow along. I loved the 90s feel and conflict between the characters. There are lots of cool and funny moments that make this a complete film that would be good to watch for almost any group.Conclusion:
I would recommend this! I thoroughly enjoyed this and it is something new and different from the other marvel and avengers movies (which is a good thing). I would give it a 7.5 out of 10.",7,4,8,26 July 2019
The Irishman," It's okay, but only okay...
","Ohhh Robert de Niro, how good of a mafia actor he is couldn't save this movie in the end.Plot:
The plot of this film is a bit hard to follow, especially when you consider there is a crap load of it.. like 3 and a half hours!!! Holy cow that's way to long.. I found myself confused and bored by the end, I mean I didnt even finish it that's how bored I was. It has really cool and good scenes but gets let down by a lot of bad scenes. Some killing or fighting scenes in this movie are hilariously bad and I cant believe they made it past editing... they are like high school level bad.Cinematography:
Pretty good, except some horrible horrible scenes that are worse than high school plays. But there are mainly good shots and the set, and costume designs are really cool, doing a good job of portraying the year they're in.Acting:
Of course robert is very good in this film as he is the king of mafia movies. And I really cant complain about anyone else's acting either, this was a strong point of this film.Summary:
I wouldn't give this a watch if I were you. However if your a really big mafia fan I mean how can a robert de niro film disappoint you?",5,4,8,16 December 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Not as good as you might think...
","Starting off with a quick paragraph, this film was bad. As in I didnt like it. The plot feels random and messy and the characterization and acting leave a bitter taste, and here's why.Plot:
The story was all over the place, not sure what it wanted to tell the viewer as its filled with mainly annoying sassy moments with highs and lows with no real meaning, symbolism, plot direction, etc.. it's supposed to tell the story of the infamous band queen but instead feels more like a look into egotistical behaviour.Cinematography:
There were lots of great shots and transitions strewn throughout this film and I really enjoyed the quality of the production. However a lot of scenes were splayed randomly but that's more to do with plot than anything.Acting:
Okay, okay. I've heard everyone say what a good job rami malek did of portraying Freddie, but I disagree. The prostectic teeth they had in looked way over the top and made his speech very muddy. He also acted in a way where you just wanted to strangle him the whole time.. no matter how Freddie was I just dont understand in a movie all about how great a person and band was that you just make the viewer hate the protagonist so much.. I mean he is a damn right all the way to the end. Drug addict, cheater, betrayer, bossy, egotistical and the list goes on.Overall:
I wouldnt reccomend this film at all unless your a die hard queen fan, and dont mind messy films. The redeeming factor in this film is how good and cool the concerts and song design are. But that's about it and you can just watch those scenes on YouTube and save yourself a couple of hours.",3,4,7,16 December 2019
The Hills Have Eyes," Not bad, glad I watched it
","To start this review off, I have never seen the original 1970s version but I am however a fan of slasher comedies and this one is nicely unique.Plot:
The story is very slasher familiar, so basically follows common formula for most slasher movies. However it was nicely done and uniquely done by having cannibals living in hills all disformed by radiation. its a very interesting subject. The movie does a good job of introducing scenery, characters, villains and giving a good creepy chill down your spine. Very gory and pretty much a good slasher flick, however only down side is the characters make insanely dumb decisions sometimes which is always painful to watch, mind the pun.Cinematography:
For a slasher movie it ticks all the boxes of having very good shots, gory special affects/ prostectics especially for the time. Cant say much more it's good for the age of the film.Acting:
The performances are again that of a slasher flick. Pretty good but not oscar winning. They did a good job of making us feel concerned and uneasy all the way through the movie.Summary:
I thought this movie was pretty cool and interesting. Definitely a good watch and If you like horror movies, i would highly suggest it.",7,2,3,9 January 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Why did I enjoy this so much?
","This film is either a love or hate it scenario. Even in my case I hated reservoir dogs and hateful 8, but loved kill bill and django. With this Quentin Tarantino movie its no different, but in my case I loved it, and here's why.Plot:
The plot is slow like a lot of Quentin's other movies. It was boring sometimes but if you arnt distracted you should be interested enough with the crazy good replication of old Hollywood and the protagonists. The ending was great, I just wished there was a little more scenes like the end, but it is still a enjoyable film.Acting:
Wow, the acting like everyone would predict is fantastic from Brad Pitt, leonardo, and everyone else involved. It has a massive cast of A listers who do a great job with what they're given. Like I said, with Quentin's films they are slow and sometimes boring. However brad Pitt's scenes were my favorite and were great throughout.Cinematography:
This is a special film that has such a huge budget and director that it is extremely detailed and a special experience to see. All the way through costume design, sets, camera shots, symbolism and references is great.Conclusion:
This is not for everyone, but if you dont mind slow going plots and Tarantino's style of film making then you'll love this film. Its special and deserves a watch, in my case very enjoyable.",8,0,1,4 January 2020
Drive," Tense, immersive and almost perfect
","This movie was real close for me calling it perfect and giving it a 10, you know I obviously liked it.. but read on to find out why it was shy of a 10.Acting/cast:
Wow! he cast is absolutely awesome. A ton of great well known a listers that did so well at their interesting and bad ass characters. Ryan Reynolds seems a bit too awkward at times but I liked that he was subtle with dialog. Characterization was top notch, and you really get a sense of tension, fear, thrill and so much more just from the acting. I really liked the relationship between the protagonists as well. You really care for all the characters and love the ride.Music/cinematography:
Hear is mainly where it goes shy from a 10. The music is way way off and is in my opinion not a good fit for the scenes. It's like edm futuristic music but for what is dramatic or relaxing scenes. Not all the music but most. Next the scenes and shots were great but my main gripe was with that insanely crappy shadow scene near the end.. it's a shadow that looks like a blob, and they play it in the most climatic part, it was frustrating to say the least.Story:
Here's where the acting and plot make for what is a thrilling, intense and beautiful piece of cinema. The action scenes are really well done and spine chilling. The drive scenes and for a car guy like myself are satisfying. My only gripe is when ryan rammed that car 2/3 into the movie once in the rear and then t boned, the car looked absolutely fine.. not even a busted headlight. But besides that, I really enjoyed the plot. It wasnt too complicated but it wasnt simple either, it was a nice ride.Summary:
If you havnt guessed already I really enjoyed this film and would highly suggest it. It unfortunately wasnt a 10 for me and had a few faults. But the overwhelming joy i had watching this easily puts the faults far behind the rear view mirror.",8,0,2,31 March 2020
Children of Men," Not great, but mildly good
","This movie isnt as what people proclaim it to be. It has problems, read on the find out why.Cinematography:
Why in good grief does this movie have shaky camera shots 100% of the movie? It's such a crap shot that I wish directors would stop using.. it should only be used in POV, explosion, and fight scenes. Would of been 1000 times better if they just had a stabilizer.Special affects:
Some of the scenes where they implement CGI or just special affects with smart camera angles Is absolutely amazing. Very kingsman like but also has some scenes were if feels very inaccurate. Like they baby never crying even though there is gun shots happening. And other unrealistic things but overall it's good.Acting:
Wow, very decent acting in this. Everyone seems very believable and have the ability to make you feel what they're trying to induce.Story:
Very good plot on paper and its pretty well done. I will say the 1st 40mins of the movie I hated and felt so boring and mundane. Then it started to pick up and get pretty interesting in the end. Speaking of the end I actually liked it, it made you feel for the characters and gave a good send off to the film. I just wished they had done some scenes better because it's just not done to my liking.Summary:
Overall I would say this film is above being alright. Many things in this film I hated or didnt like I just dont have the space or time to write. However This film has a very unique story and has amazing special affects. I believe you should give it a watch, it's not great but unique enough to be a must watch.",6,0,1,14 March 2020
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Are you guys crazy?
","I'm in absolute disbelief at all the 10/10s this is getting.. it's like the director wanted to make an abstract art piece instead of a movie, here's a honest review.Acting:
Absolutely strange as hell characters and with an amazing cast I get let down constantly because you cant do a good job of crazy, boring and slow characterization.Cinematography:
For a movie this has horrible camera work. I hate the ol shaky camera shot, its awful. The shots are all just the same close up, mid shot and long shot all shaky.Story:
Now here's where it gets.. not juicy, not anything at all. An absolute bore of a storyline that's kinda confusing but even when you get it, it's nothing interesting at all just a slow boring and crazy relationship between two people, with some 'the 6th day' vibe going on.Summary:
I absolutely love jim Carey and 99% of his movies but this one is on another level. Such a boring and dorky storyline I couldn't even finish it and stopped 3/4 way through. So yes I would highly suggest you do not watch this movie and have no clue why its rated anything above a 3 at all. Can I erase my memory of this movie just like jim?",2,1,3,26 February 2020
The Witch," Why does this have such high reviews??
","Okay just wanna say i watched this many months ago and only wanted to submit a review because of the high review score this has.. here's why.Plot:
This movie is boring, like really really boring. It has lots of plot direction that leads no where and constant silence and confusion plagues this movie. The cast is good but the plot is incredibly bad and directing just as bad that this becomes hard to finish.Acting:
The acting is the best part of this film. They have a good cast but with such bad directing, dialog and story leads to the performances being meaningless. You cant fix bad characters with good actors, you just cant.Cinematography:
Now the special affects and scenes are done weirdly. Not good and a matter of fact not scary at all. The tone of this seems strange rather than immersive and thrilling.Summary:
Please dont watch this, Its long and extremely boring. I love horror movies but this is no horror. More like a weird telling of strange circumstances happening to a family which doesnt lead anywhere and isnt spooky. You've been warned.",3,5,9,13 January 2020
Joker," One of those special movies
","I originally was going to give this a 7 but after days went by I was still thinking about this film and had to give it a 8. Keep reading to find out why it's so highly talked about.Plot:
The storyline is very unique. The director really knew what he was doing and I'm sure this film will be used as examples of film making. It is very inclusive and feels very real. The viewer gets taken through a mental world and state like no other and you really get attached to Arthur and feel for his character. It is slow paced at first but gets heavier and heavier the more Arthur's mental state deteriorates. It is a very well written story.Acting:
The performance of Arthur/joker is absolutely brilliant. You feel sad, confused and all the above for joker and he does a really great job of creating a very real and sadistic performance that is interesting and also unique.Cinematography:
The CGI, shots and overall attention to detail is phenomenal In this film. All shots and CGI has a symbolic reason and everything is thought of. You really get a sense of the type of world it is. Just watch the director talk about all they did to make this a believable setting.Conclusion:
I cant say more about this movie. It definitely does deserve the praise its getting and its a movie that will be studied by film students. I highly suggest that you watch it, you wont be disappointed, it's unlike many movies out there.",8,2,5,4 January 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Unique and really enjoyable
","I started watching this without any bias at all, ready to give it a rating without holding back. Well this definitely deserves a 9, here's why.Plot:
We mainly follow along the young boy (jojo) and his imaginary 'friend' Hitler. I absolutely loved the story of this, it's so wholesome and yet very comedic with a really dark comedy like vibe but suitable for the whole family. There are definitely some edgy jokes but the story is done really well where it's funny, respectful, and very endearing.Acting:
The cast is really great, they obviously took their time to choose the right people. Jojo was played by a very talented kid who did a great job as well as the Jewish girl. Taika did a really good job at delivering a funny performance yet very unique performance of hitler.
You really get a sense of feeling towards all the characters and that's done by good writing, characterization and acting.Cinematography:
It's good, they dont rely too much to cgi but theres some cool bits in there. The story doesn't really involve much affects but when they do have them, they're done well. All the shots are great as well.Summary:
A very good movie which I believe you should definitely watch. In fact it was so good I could probably watch it again. And I absolutely hate watching movies more than once.",9,4,9,11 January 2020
John Wick: Chapter 2," No story, No plot, but a whole lot of boring gun scenes!
","I absolutely love action movies, like Rambo, Alien, and taken. But this is a absolute disaster of an action movie...Short review:
This movie has a terrible plot, dialog, characterization and doesn't come close to how good the 1st john wick is. This is basically just a set up for the 3rd movie and is just filled with gun scene after gun scene and becomes extremely boring and pointless. Save your time because even a hardcore action movie fanboy like me absolutely hated this movie.",3,64,107,25 May 2019
The Island," Absolutely amazing!
","Wow, just wow. I have seen countless amounts of movies and this one actually had a unique plot. The insanely good acting,story and c.g.i for it being a 2005 film is fantastic, and here's why.Cinematography:
Really good c.g.i for the time, great camera angles and a real blockbuster look. However the only thing I disliked was how many shaky camera angles there were. However that's only a very small complaint.Acting:
Brilliant acting! Was really, really good from everyone involved and the cast is plentiful with well known movie stars.Plot/story:
What a delight, I haven't seen something this unique and cool for a long time. This movie has such an interesting ideology and symbolism with human life, whilst being very interesting and having a cool sci fi/futuristic type vibe. However my only complaint that is giving it a 9/10 instead of a 10 is because some scenes seem very convenient, like they have the perfect things at the time to escape death but beyond that its fantastic.Conclusion:
Go and watch this movie if you like interesting plots and sci fi movies. Reminds me a lot of 'repo men' and 'fifth element'. I have no clue why some people gave this a negative review... they must be brain dead cause mark my words this will be apart of the classic great movies in about 20 years time.",9,1,4,20 June 2019
