Sucker Punch," If your into Videogames and Anime - You'll love this!
","I just rented this one with some average expectations. Saw the trailer and was quite curious, since 300 is one of my all time favorites.For those CGI lovers, I guess the movie is awesome. From anime styled camera angles, to outstanding acrobatics, it really gives you the taste of state of the art sci-fi action.Without spoiling the plot, the movie sets the character, into several scenarios where she must obtain an item to escape her 'prisons' in the real world. Typical video game clich√©. She even has fantastic boss fight at each 'level's' end. This actually works quite well because the subplots within the movie are simple and engaging enough to give purpose to all these sets. If you're a fan o games like Devil May Cry, Killzone, Soul Calibur or Ninja Gaiden you'll love this movie.I did find some flaws in it though. The dreamy worlds do not quite add up to 'reality'. Some 'glue' plot is missing and after Inception you would hope for better.",7,4,7,8 July 2011
