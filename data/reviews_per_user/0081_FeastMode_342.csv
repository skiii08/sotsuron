The Rock," my notes
","Beastly movie. entertaining action flick. has flaws and things you can question, and some outdated moments but overall it still felt new. AMAZING musical score, good acting, awesome premise. The action itself actually wasn't done that well at times, some use of quick cuts and shaky cam. regardless, i enjoy this movie a LOT. it is a borderline classic for me in the action genre. one of the best parts about this movie are the characters. connery is a beast and hilarious, and harris is one of my favorite villains, one you surprisingly find yourself rooting for sometimes (about 5 viewings)",8,3,4,26 June 2019

The Blair Witch Project," my notes
","This movie is horrendous. i was soooooooooooo bored. the majority of the movie is them complaining about being lost and arguing with each other about who's fault it is. there are extensively long scenes of complete darkness i get the idea of trying to create tension, but i'm watching a motion picture without a picture for long portions of the movie. the only thing good about this is how they made it, with almost no budget and the actors having limited knowledge of the script. but even with that i can't give it a one star. there was almost nothing scary about this. other than it barely being creepy,
SPOILERS
there were literally only two scenes of something 'scary' actually happening. the first takes place about an hour into the movie, and the second with 5 minutes left. i can't believe i wasted an hour and twenty minutes for those two useless scenes. and they never actually show anything. no joke. nothing.

First Man," my notes
","I hated this movie. i was so unbelievably bored. i couldn't believe i was only an hour in when i checked the time. the movie focused on relationship drama. i just didn't care about anything that had to do with his wife and family, which was almost the entire movie.i also thought some of it was poorly done. i get the reason for the shaking cam in the launch scenes, but it was really annoying. and there were a few questionable parts where it seemed to be done that way to be more theatrical at the expense of realism. i can't say for sure, but i think so.it's difficult to be a space movie after interstellar. even the non-boring family parts, the parts in space weren't that impressive to me. it paled in comparison to the similar scenes in interstellar. and that was one small aspect of interstellar, which was filled with other amazing aspects. this movie had unimpressive space scenes with nothing else of value to me surrounding it (1 viewing)",2,2,5,27 July 2019

Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," this is a decently enjoyable movie... except for jarjar
","Let's just get this out of the way. i already knew about all the hate for jarjar, so i was expecting it. and i was still blown away by how bad he was. he is... hands down... the worst movie character in history. i am baffled by his existence. i am guessing george lucas is a fan of bugs bunny, because he nearly turned this movie into a cartoon. and i can't believe how much screen time he got. if he was removed from the movie, i estimate that this could have been a 6/10, as a dumb but entertaining action/adventure popcorn flickthis movie was average in a lot of ways, but it excelled in other ways. most of the action was awesome. a few scenes made my jaw drop. the light saber battles were beastly. it was so cool to really see what jedi can do. some of the music was amazing. and even tho the special effects were pretty bad, so many of the scenes were visually pleasing.i got a lot of enjoyment out of this movie, and never felt like i wanted to quit, like i did with the originals. i'm actually glad i re-watched it (2 viewings 12/27/19)",4,3,6,28 December 2019

the two reveals were so awesome, first that he did in fact fake his injury, and the second being that mr. glass caused those disasters. great writing and execution.i love how the three characters main arcs were completed one by one. bruce willis is no longer sad because he's doing what he's supposed to be doing and saved his marriage. his son who no longer feels lost and his belief that his father is really a hero is proven true, literally and figuratively. and mr. glass finally finding his true purpose as the arch enemy to the superhero.this is a superhero movie that does not follow any of the usual tropes we see in that genre. i normally love when something builds up to a big action scene. but this movie's climax was so much more impactful than an action scene. when he is fighting the rapist, i am brought to tears. it's such a perfect climax and a fitting conclusion laced with goose-bump-inducing music",9,3,4,24 June 2019

my comments from a convo with samie and ronnie:I really try to give it a chance, try to move past the little weird stuff that I didn't like. But it didn't amount to anything worth doing that for
Wasn't scary. And as much as I tried to give the weird voices a chance, they were pretty stupid
It seems like there was a lot of stuff that he put in there to try to give it meaning but just seemed random and stupid. Like the opening texts about the tunnels Underground, what was that even trying to imply
Was the holding hands thing a social commentary on world hunger? I don't really understand. I get that it's one of the last things the little girl watched before getting switched
You know what was funny, the whole time I was waiting to see what the little boys magic trick would end up doing, we finally see that it basically just causes a small spark that helps him somehow Escape even though it really does nothing lol
I'm all for making up some weird story but you have to have at least some semblance of something concrete or something you can hold on to that makes sense. Can't just be a bunch of Madness
Or why the shadow lady would try to kill the husband and kids, I guess they're not technically her husband and kids but she wants to kill them?
Yes I was definitely thinking this. This is supposedly all across America but no one ever went down there and notice these people
What about homeless people or little kids
Or construction workers
To me the coolest part about the movie was the fact that I thought it was confined to this family and their experience and then we find out that it's basically the Apocalypse. Not sure if I have seen that before
Man if we really want to get down to it there are so many tiny things that were so dumb. Things that I would normally let slide if I like the movie. Do you remember when she was handcuffed to the table and she was trying to escape or reach the fireplace thing
There are like 12 things she could have done easily
I'm sorry can you not pick up a table
Or slide it over. Or move the Handcuff all the way to the corner so you have more room
You want to know something that makes the least sense of all. How would the kids look look the same. Supposedly these are all clones. But the shadow lady describes giving birth the same time as the real girl. Even if she had sex with the same shadow guy, there's basically 0% chance that the kids would look the same
Another question, why did the little boy all of a sudden have the power to force his shadow to kill himself
Another question, it seems that all of the real people are influencing what all of the Shadows are doing Underground. But when the shadow girl switches with the real girl in the beginning, the shadow girl above ground is now controlling what the real girl underground is doing. So why does the power to control switch",3,1,4,27 July 2019

omg, so after Batman jams the frequency on the mind control devices attached to all the penguins (rofl rofl rofl), and makes the penguins go back to penguin lair, for some reason he pulls out the trigger that launches all the missiles, activates it, and subsequently loses it in a fight with the penguin who sets off all the missiles, causing random explosions throughout the last ten minutes of the movie. Also, they showed a shadow of cat woman after we thought she was dead, which would have been cool to let the audience decide if they thought she was still alive or not. But of course being a terrible old movie, they had to give the audience what they wanted and showed that she was still alive before the credits rolled. also, how did she become Catwoman? She was just a regular secretary who didn't know how to fight who was pushed off of a building and survived, but then all of a sudden she seem to have powers allowing her to die nine times and being able to fight with the likes of Batman",3,5,27,25 June 2019

'Orders, sir?' let's just die. and then the thousands of other ships are like ok lets just go home. bro. bro.there are so many more little things. things that are done just for the audience that make NO sense. that are impossible or just ridiculous coincidences. all over the place. the whole calypso story did not impact anything. also how they unleashed her was so stupid, you have to say it as if it's coming from a lover. oh and jack sparrow can grab any rope on the ship and launch himself or even fly or create a parachute. there is so much more. this movie deserves a hilariocity review",2,0,1,24 July 2019

","Where was the evil-ness????? even the intro credits had heroic music. i wish it had a more evil tone.overall this was a bad movie. bad story, horrible pacing, bloated with needless characters. bad choppy directing. it also tried to add some humor and most of it not only didn't work, but felt very forced, awkward and out of place. some of the jokes were also very lame and cringe-worthy. i like when superhero movies have good comedy like most of the MCU movies, but it really isn't necessary. And I think they did reshoots where they added some of those comedic scenes, and a few times it really seemed like something was just added in the middle of the scene that didn't fit. i also thought the villain was forgettable. she was cool at times but really she was pretty weak (figuratively)there were so many useless characters, actually most of them. i really only liked the joker, harley quinn and deadshot. i loved harley quinn and i wanted to see more of her (figuratively). her character is very intriguing, evil and funny at the same time. jared leto had an interesting take on the joker, which i liked for the most part. he felt intimidating and psychotic in certain scenes. the problem was he was barely in the movie. also, his introduction was non-existent. we are seeing a new actor play the biggest Batman villain, there should have been a build up or some anticipation when we are about to see him for the first time. but they just cut to a scene with him talking to Harley at a table. such a wasted opportunity. for reference, remember the introduction to the joker in the dark knight? that was AMAZING and unforgettable.the other really disappointing thing is that the action was very useless. coming out of the movie i can't think of one action scene that stood out. they had a few cool slow motion moments but creative action was non-existent. after watching it a second time, i conclude that none of the action in this movie is good. it is horrible. i could pick 100 action scenes from the different marvel movies that are better than any scene in here. and that's not an exaggeration. i wanted to see them work together. but they didn't work together at all, in a sense of using each other's skills in combination, etc. the only used actual teamwork one time in the entire movie.i was really into the first 30 minutes-ish of this movie. there were lots of cool scenes and i liked learning who the characters were and what they were about. but then they kept adding more characters as the movie went on, new characters i had no interest in, while also taking up any time the original characters would have had to be developed. and some of the lines in this movie are laughable. there are a lot of questionable parts and things you can make fun of for not making sense. this movie was a huge disappointment. i could have fallen in love if it was done right.at least this movie gave me a new awesome song: Heathens by Twenty One Pilots. good for you, movie.

the end battle with the huge world destruction is becoming a very typical of DC movies. it's like a normal thing now. the funny thing is, it's so commonplace that they actually had a montage of world destruction not even halfway through the movie. as if the city getting destroyed isn't a big thing any more, let's just sum it up really quick with some good music.something that really bothered me is one of many scenes that were choppy. flag takes june to her brother, they don't say why but i think everyone assumes she's there to stop him. it then immediately cuts to him saying she bolted. wasn't sure why that happened. and even thought it was 'explained' later, it still could have been done better. the real problem comes later in the movie with the 'reveal' of what really happened. but the only real difference is that they showed a bomb they were going to use to kill the brother. everything else was basically the same so they didn't really tell us anything new. so why replay all those scenes again as if we need to understand what really happened. when they started showing it again i was excited to see what really happened but it was nothing. smhso many times they show the enchantress destroying stuff across the world, satelites in space and around america using completely destructive beams. but then she fights her enemies with swords and fists. so many things like this make no sense. the mind control stuff was such a weak attempt. and the way they kill the big dude and end the final battle is so lame. basically just explode it. so why couldn't that be done in a million other ways. it was never mentioned that they need to get close to blow it up. and to kill the enchantress, they basically just tricked her cause she's really dumb. pretend to be on her side for 5 seconds then slice her while saying one of the worst lines in the movie: 'There's just one teeny problem, you messed with my friends.' Heart slice, game over....... lame over. omg and let's not forget the laughable scene when the black chick kills all of her innocent employees. lolololol. i just convinced myself to drop it from 2.5 to 1.5.

Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," STAR WARS FANS ARE THE WORST FANS EVER
","(my brief thoughts on the movie after the rant)STAR WARS FANS ARE THE WORST FANS EVER. they don't know what they want. they just love crying and complaining. they are toxic. and toxic breeds toxic. misery loves company.this movie is not flawless. but some of the complaints i've heard from star wars fans are laughable. i listened to numerous youtube reviews, and all i'm hearing is fanboy crying. star wars fans have no idea what they want. they idealize the original trilogy, which is FILLED with flaws, plot holes, bad acting, bad dialogue, and absurdities that would make today's critics faint. but to star wars fans, those are legendary classics that no one is allowed to criticize.then they get the prequels, which are BAD movies, but have some value to them, and star wars fans cry and complain as usual, but at least they had reason to. still doesn't mean you should cry like a baby cause... internet. smh. but so many complaints revolved around the prequels not feeling like star wars. they are just too different from the original trilogy.then comes disney. force awakens is so well made. with great characters, a good story, well put together. flows well. good humor. awesome new droid. but of course, star wars fans cry because it's too similar to episode 4. it's too safe. it doesn't take any risks.... so even though it's awesome, you have to find a complaint.in comes the last jedi. takes bold risks and different directions. star wars fans go nuts. why would you do this? stop changing it? MAKE UP YOUR MINDSNow rise of skywalker comes out. and ppl are calling it the worst star wars movie? are you guys out of your minds. you can make montages of the dumbest and most absurd scenes, lines of dialgue and bad acting from the prequel trilogy. the montage would be over an hour long. there is so much absolute garbage in star wars. they were basically cartoons (btw after watching phantom menace I am convinced that george lucas love bugs bunny cartoons). 'You-sa in big doo-doo dis time!' bro... 'I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere.' if you are honestly trying to say that rise of skywalker is worse than the prequels, you should never watch a movie again in your life.there is occasionally a complaint about subpar film-making, but almost everything i heard was about it not following previous star wars lore or no longer being star wars. 'how can she do that?' 'who taught her that technique?' 'since when can jedi do this?' 'why is she so OP?'..... i don't even really know how to respond. movies are supposed to do this. what are you expecting? that only the rules in the original trilogy apply and everything else is just making stuff up? the rules in the original trilogy were made up. did anyone complain in episode 6 when all of a sudden you can shoot lightning out of your fingers? nope.i feel like ppl forgot how to watch movies. and i blame it on the age of the internet and social media. form your own opinions ppl. and try to go in blind. stop reading about the movie before you watch it. it paints your opinion. watch what the film-maker has created and take it for what it is. stop clinging to what you are expecting to happen, what you think it's supposed to be.My thoughts on the movie:this is an entertaining movie for the most part. but it didn't stick the landing as well as i wanted it to. the final act was a little clunky with some dumb parts. if you turn your brain off you can have some funthe first time i watched it, i was at the edge of my seat for most of it. i caught myself smiling so many times. i finally get to see so many things that i've wanted to see from the jedi. so much of it is exactly what i wanted it to be. it's visually pleasing as usual. on second viewing it didn't thrill me as much (2 viewings, 1/2/2020, 6/6/2020)",6,11,21,3 January 2020

Why?and even tho i don't require amazing dialogue for a great film, the dialogue in this movie does not come near the QT standards.the one true positive i'll give this movie is...

","Very aesthetically pleasing with a GREAT cast. but overall i felt a little underwhelmed, especially with the action. and some of the parts that seem like they are fully CGI feel unreal. black panther was more bad-ass in civil war than in this movie, and that's not a good thing when he was one of like 12 superheroes in that movie with very little screen time, while starring in this one.on second viewing most of my feelings are confirmed. this is a very weak movie. weak action, little semblance of story, poor dialogue, cliche moments. worst of all, it really tested my patience with the lack of excitement. i think this is the only time i've ever said that about an MCU movie. even the stan lee cameo was probably the worst in any marvel movie. the token white guy's storyline was pointless. forrest whittaker was BAD.i tried one more time, gave it a third chance. i starts off well, but it spends so much time in the set up phase, only to make me wonder what the setup had anything to do with the plot. it was overly preachy, which i don't like in my movies. i more than fine with messages, but not this blatant. i fully sympathize with the message, but i don't like it in my entertainment. i was straight-up laughing at forrest whittaker's accent.i know i keep going back to this, but i can't emphasize it enough. every moment that t'challa or black panther were on the screen in civil war was pure gold. i immediately fell in love with black panther. i didn't know he was in the movie, didn't know t'challa was a superhero, liked the actor right away. and it was all so perfect. all his fight scenes were amazing. his beastliness immediately rivaled the rest of the MCU crew. the post credit scene got me SO excited for this movie. it should have been really easy to please me. the fact that they didn't saddens me (3 viewings, 5/8/2020)

for someone named killmonger, he really likes throwing ppl rather than dealing a fatal blow. the fake death of t'challa was so lame. why is there air craft battles in this? you know i love me some jet fights but it really wasn't necessary in this movie and didn't feel like it belonged. felt like hey it's an mcu movie we need flight battles.i really didn't understand the story line, i would love for someone to explain it to me. killmonger shows up in wakanda like 45 minutes into the movie. i was trying to understand why the stuff before it lead us here. he stole the vibranium ax for klau, klau tried to sell it to the cia, got caught, killmonger broke him out, killed him, and then went to wakanda. what? the only thing i could think of is that he needed klau to gain an audience, but then why didn't he kill him from the start? why steal the ax? stuff just kind of happened cause the story said so, didn't have a natural flow.and so many moments were so obvious, like his sister saying 'there is no way he can beat t'challa' = t'challa is gonna lose. mbaka saying we will not help = we will come in at the last second to have a dramatic entrance. the entire last action sequence did very little for me. not a fan of his new explosive ability, i really loved that he's basically a ninja, no need for all that extra stuff. does cap need a bunch of fancy colorful weapons? no. neither does black panther. similar to how i felt about spider-man's suit",4,2,5,26 July 2019

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," my notes
","Beastly movie, epic action scenes, and a phenomenal musical score. i had issues with how sloppy the story was in the theatrical version, but after watching the ultimate extended cut, the story is actually really good. studios need to keep their hands off these movies and let artists create art. The visuals and cinematography were outstanding. the battles were great. (5 viewings)
SPOILERS
The opening scene was beautifully shot and very moving with great music. The next scene which was the first action sequence was very creative and clever. It was the final battle from man of steel, but from Bruce Wayne's perspective. I think it was a great way to show how Bruce Wayne first found out about Superman. the batman fight scene when trying to save martha was AMAZING. and the final battle was so EPIC with unbelievably awesome musicI wasn't a fan of the whole Superman is dead thing at the end of the movie when everyone in the theater knew he was gonna be alive, could have done without it. The whole thing with Lois Lane at the end when she wanted to hide the spear, but then wanted to get it back, but then was drowning, but then superman saves her, but then Superman was drowning and she had to save him... useless and should have been taken out of the movie. and the intro to the other justice league members should not have been in this movie. it was moving so well and that just slowed it down with something that was irrelevant to this movie.I think it was a missed opportunity for a scene that shows the moment Bruce Wayne finds out that Clark Kent is Superman, or when Superman finds out Bruce Wayne is Batman. They went in a different direction, which i guess is ok.",8,2,4,30 June 2019

Warcraft," my notes
","Absolutely horrible. the only redeeming quality is some good CGI on the orc. Other than that EVERYTHING was terrible. this was like mortal kombat with better CGI. THE WORST DIALOGUE EVER. And the awful acting made the horrible dialogue sound even worse. there were so many times when the dialogue didn't even make sense. One person would say something, then the other person would respond in a way that has nothing to do with what the first person said. For example, 'Where are we going' ... 'We must fight as one' (end scene). If you don't fully pay attention you may let it slide. But if you do, you will notice the conversation does not flow at all like any conversation should. They just say what the movie wants them to say.Another problem is that this movie tried to be primarily story-based. A movie like this really should have been a fun popcorn flick with good action and some funny banter between the characters. Instead, they tried to make this complex story that was so scattered and all over the place. And I didn't care about any of it. Why? Because it was useless. Why? Because the characters were useless. I didn't like any of them except the main orc character, and barely. All of the humans were pointless. So much bad acting.I didn't even get to the worst part of the acting. IMO, Paula Patton is the worst popular actress in hollywood today. I have noticed this in many of her past movies. She makes the same face for everything. She furrows her brow, that's it. Regardless of the emotion, it's that face. All her lines sounded soooooo awkward. Her romance was SOOOOO AWKWARD. Completely forced. I think she also made me like Mission Impossible 4 less, and she was terrible in 2 Guns and Deja Vu.Other than all the terrible things in the movie, I figured it would at least have some good war scenes, since it's called WARcraft. Nope. Not one action scene stood out to me. And there were barely any of them. This movie was SO boring. I kept thinking, can we please get this moving along. But no, the story... we need more story (sarcasm). The only cool scenes were the magic ones.Adam was right on this one. I am baffled that so many users liked this movie.

mainly the most ridiculously obvious twist i can remember. which is that David is pretending to be Walter. They clearly showed that the fight between them could have gone either way and they didn't show the ending. i knew immediately. but it wouldn't have been a big deal. not having a twist is not necessarily a bad thing, most movies don't. but in this case, they seemed to have tried sooooo hard to try to convince us that it wasn't true before they finally revealed it. and then the final reveal was so lame: 'are we going to build a cabin together? omg you're david.' not only did it not hit but if you wanna be nit-picky it's pretty stupid that she waited to ask that question until 2 seconds after he locked her in. it wasn't like he locked her in and they continued a conversation that stumbled onto that point. she asked him to try to confirm it was david after she became suspicious. maybe it won't bother me as much the second time i watch it but it just brought me down. and also, if they could have pulled it off better, it would have been a great twist. but it may have been hard to pull off. they just shouldn't have played it out as much as they did",6,2,3,24 July 2019
