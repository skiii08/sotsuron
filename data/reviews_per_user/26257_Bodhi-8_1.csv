The Blair Witch Project," Brilliant but not scary
","I am a bit disappointed about this movie. Don't get me wrong: I think it is a brilliant idea (script) and the actors played very convincing,.....but it just didn't scare me. Not even for one second. I bought the DVD without watching it first, and maybe it's because I expected too much of it or something, but I didn't find it scary. Maybe it only 'works' in the cinema, but I did everything I could to make it scary: Watched it at night, turned off the lights, closed all the curtains, putt up the volume,....but it just wasn't scary. The only time when it was becoming scary, the movie ended.Once again; the actors played very well, the idea of the script is just brilliant and it's not a bad movie, but I don't think it was very scary. And that was my reason for buying it. I thought it was going to be one of the most scary movies I've seen, which turned out to be a big disappointment.My Rating: 6",Null,0,0,22 November 1999
