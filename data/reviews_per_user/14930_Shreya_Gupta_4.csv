The Blair Witch Project," Brilliant !!!
","The Blair Witch project was one of the first and most successful found footage films, and it remains one of the best. The chillingly realistic premise and performances help the film overcome a general sense that not much really happens.",8,0,0,23 June 2020
Edward Scissorhands," Enjoyable
",A modern day fairy tale which takes you back to watching disney movies with your parents. You can't really imagine any other actor playing the role of Edward Scissorhands than Johnny Depp. It's also probably Winona Ryder's performance outside of Heathers. I suspect there's also a lot of meaning to the film since it deals with someone that doesn't fit in. His desire to fit in and other peoples reactions to him are the cornerstone of the film. In some ways this is not dissimilar to the Hunchback of Notre Damme which has a similar metaphor.,8,0,1,21 March 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino does it again!
","One of the best movies of 2019, The acting in this movie is great, the story is awesome, and it's cool how this film takes place in the 1960's. It's a throwback to an era in history, even with all it's faults, there still remains an innocence in American culture that has long since past. Thank you for still making movies for people who love them.",9,1,5,7 June 2020
It Chapter Two," Below Average.
","I enjoyed chapter 1 - didn't find it scary, but it was a fun, entertaining blast. Chapter 2 is, let's be clear, far too long. At two hours fifty minutes, it could easily lose an hour's running time with little difficulty - a generic 'getting the gang back together' riff being one of the chief offenders. It drags so much, that by the time the final hour or so rolls around, I was just tired. It's a pretty diverting final hour, but it too is needlessly extended. With the talent around this movie, there's an interesting and potentially frightening take on childhood trauma and memory buried somewhere; but that movie is buried beneath the acres pointlessness.",5,0,2,8 June 2020
