What you commented to do if these films like there? The film, I think is great, as special effects, such as history, as it develops and the recitation of Dannis Quaid. The storyline is likely, it is very likely a future climate change like this unless countermeasures are taken. A good movie can only see people with the more open-minded.

Perhaps the story that binds the death penalty is very beautiful impression to the audience as the film The Green Mile and Salvador.

","Beautiful film full of love but also a lot of violence, very well edited and well produced, with a great soundtrack. This film in Italy has not had much publicity and one of the things that struck me was the spectacle of the fighting comparable to that of the great American films d war. The love between two brothers sowing hatred but many times the war brutalizes the man in fact one of the two brothers is concerned by the monstrosity of war while the other remains Qasi immune. An anti-film par excellence, this shows that there are not only great films of American origin but that other nations are capable of producing excellent blockbuster. Inimenticabile beautiful story for a movie, one of the best movies I've ever seen.Grand and moving",10,2,3,17 January 2010
The Terminal," good
","beautiful film. As to the usual one, the usual negative comments which talk about a classical film some years 80 which everyone does not like it to the nostalgic ones are met.Sure Heros that this film had to have a judgment in this site. In fact reviewers' good part has put a high vote to the previous episodes. Because this contrast? I know the reason. Since assumptive reviewers' good part favorably sees the past and as the past is 'better' than the present they have given several credit to the preceding episodes being still the last episode more explosive and spectacular. At this point should reject also the old episodes but there are here two weights and two measure.In fact also cinema masterpieces have been criticized and denigrated. Good part some reviewers of this site belong to the very bad reviewers. Better think separately with its head. I was sure that the god fun old episode did not like it. Who has to be withdrawn is not george lucas but the last reviewer SAMPAT GO AWAY. Cary Guffey",10,0,2,23 April 2009
The Shawshank Redemption," Good movie but 9 is too extreme,Thomas MC Fadden you are too extreme
","Good movie but 9 is too extreme, is certainly one of the masterpieces of cinema, but like many Hollywood movies there is some bad things, when the protagonist moves down the sewer pipe, in reality it would be caught bad. A very nice movie that you can refer to the way that each of us must do just to get out of certain problems. After all you put poor grades to great films, especially horror. Hardly comes out of jail in a tunnel of excrement, jail and violence and degradation but you can get out mainly in Italy. However great interpretation of Morgan Freeman, many sentences are historical and should keep in mind. In the movies there must be some humanity in this film there is too much violence",8,0,1,26 January 2010
The Matrix," Good film.
","If this movie was Spielberg would have had more. Since these strontium on the assumption that a film must be beautiful to be directed by big names like Spielberg, Lucas, Jackson, Cameron. .. All these assessments are wrong you understand the level of bad opinion of this site. Only films for intellectuals can be saved. This film was produced with many dollars and the optimal use of special effects make the place as among the best science fiction film Americans.

Click," Very funny and nice!!!
","6.2 votes equal to fragile. It's 10 And 'now clear that this site has a strong antipathy towards the horror film. If this movie had been in Stephen King would have had more. For me to go to pieces is the comment by Aaron1375. AARON STILL TU, quache distant relative of SHARON? Restless character already seen previously. Why make comparisons between SILENT HILL AND MIRRORS? E '100 times better this movie. Silent hill comes from a video. Do you have anything like the original film plot. There are mediocre film recited by actors who have high ratings as we are beautiful film recited by people less known. This site is so. In this movie there is a coup scene that leaves us with mouth open the others kind of Nicole Kidman. But since this movie and played by Sutherland takes one vote less. that's disgusting.

Slumdog Millionaire," BAD,slow, tedious and very stereotyped
","This site is not doing well. I consider this film, slow, tedious and very stereotyped. Even the love shown by Jamal to the girl I've seen too predictable. The first 15 minutes are OK then it becomes boring. You gave a 8.6 to a kind of filth and 8.2 in sin city while Spelberg, Lucas, Hanks, Kubrick since 6000 should have to vote. It 'a shame. The films for intellectuals are very fashionable and spectacular films now have no more success. this film deserves 4 nominations OSCE are exaggerated, in this excellent film site had scarcely sufficiency or seven while this filth stole a 8.6 at this site to view the meters are unpacking.
