Catch Me If You Can," It caught me!
","Believe it or not, Leonardo DiCaprio has acted well in the past. 'This Boy's Life' and 'Basketball Diaries' come to mind. He couldn't miss with this kind of material. It's one of those 'how could you not like this?' kind of movies. Such a unique story is perfect fodder for a movie. People are gullible. How many firms really pore over college transcripts and check out all those references in depth? Charm gets you quite far in this life because as much as ability counts, an employer also wants to know, 'Am I going to be able to stand this guy for eight hours a day?'Here's basically a slimy little kid named Frank Abagnale fooling everyone, essentially stealing millions of dollars, pretending to be some really high-level occupations (pilot, doctor, lawyer, teacher) and what happens? The viewer actually finds himself rooting for him. That's a combination of Steven Spielberg's directorial expertise and Leo's fine work with the script.At least the Oscar folks remembered Christopher Walken by nominating him for best-supporting actor, though Chris Cooper got the statue for 'Adaptation.' Too bad. As usual, Walken takes over the screen every time he's featured, and the performance as DiCaprio's dad was Oscar-worthy. Tom Hanks was good as FBI agent Carl Hanratty, though it sounded as if he received New England accent lessons from Kevin Costner in '13 Days.' In other words, 'ugh!'Terrific film. Should have been nominated for Best Picture. It was the best I saw in 2002.",10,1,2,18 June 2003
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Not even bad enough to see for shock value.
","This is how my wife and I rang in New Years Day 2005. We visited friends, very dear friends, who had decided to rent 'Anchorman' after being reliably informed that 'Anchorman' starts off slowly but gets really, really funny as it goes on. By the end we could expect to be so hysterical that we'd be falling out of our seats, rolling around the floor like fish out of water.So we sat there, popped some corn, cracked open sodas and nestled in for what we expected to be nothing special but, hey, have a laugh, enjoy it for what it is -- just a silly little comedy. I didn't expect Shakespeare, Scorsese or Spielberg. I expected to be mildly amused every once in a while. That's all I wanted.About 90 minutes later, I realized two things: One, I had just seen without rival the single worst motion picture I have ever seen. Two, I will never get that 90 minutes back.Some movies are so dreadful they're almost worth seeing to witness how bad a movie could be. 'Anchorman' does not even fall into that dubious category.***Spoilers*** It's my firm belief that no one who sees more than one movie every five years could possibly have found the rumble scene -- with A-list actors making cameos -- the slightest bit funny. A dog getting kicked off the side of a bridge? Ron Burgundy arguing with the clubowner who's trying to make him eat cat doo-doo? Baxter the little dog talking to the grizzly bear at the zoo? Here's an example, it was shown in subtitles.... Baxter:On my journey I met one of your kind. His name was Katow-jo. We became friends. Bear: Katow-jo is my cousin. From now on, you will be known as Baxter, Friend to Bears. Go in peace. Baxter: I will spread tales of your compassion.It's one big drawn-out improv sketch -- all entirely too long and all completely humor-free. 'Anchorman' was the comedic version of your local Halloween haunted house. A bunch of people dress in scary outfits, make scary noises and jump out from every corner and yell BOO! We're startled, taken aback for minute, but not really frightened. In 'Anchorman', a bunch of actors provide the audience with comedy's version of BOO! They shock us with some loud noise or a crude joke or a cat-poop reference, and some really clever dialogue from a dog. It might amuse the feeble-minded for a second, but everyone knows this oinker really isn't the slightest bit funny.I might upgrade it to two only because Christina Applegate was looking mighty fine.",2,14,29,4 January 2005
