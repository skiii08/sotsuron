Whip It," Very Entertaining
","Whip It was surprisingly very entertaining and fun. Whip It is about a small town high school student played by Ellen Page who joins a roller derby team without her parents knowledge. It is a coming of age dramedy with some romance and family drama mixed in. Going in, I had the impression it was going to be like some really cheesy and poppy chick flick, this being Drew Barrymore's first time directing also didn't help sooth my reservations but it wasn't and I was pleasantly surprised. I actually cared for the main characters and the performances all around are very good. Ellen Page is great and very likable. She carries the emotional weight of this movie. A special mention goes out to Andrew Wilson who was in my opinion the funniest guy in the movie. It was nice to see Kristen Wig playing a real person in this movie instead of some crazy character. My only complaints are that some of the supporting characters didn't get enough screen time and that the plot is kind of predictable. Whip It is a very impressive directorial debut for Drew Barrymore. It is definitely worth watching even if you normally don't like chick flicks.",8,1,5,23 February 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Fun and Endearing
","The Grand Budapest Hotel follows a wonderful concierge (Ralph Fiennes) and his loyal lobby boy (Tony Revolori) as they get involved in a ridiculous adventure.This is in my opinion one of Wes Anderson's most beautiful films. It has a unique style. The acting is great all around. Ralph Fiennes is spectacular as Gustave. He's charming, funny, and dignified. One of the best performances of the year. My only complaint is that the great supporting cast doesn't get enough screen time because the movie moves along at a very brisk pace. If you aren't a Wes Anderson fan, this movie probably won't turn you into one but I consider The Grand Budapest Hotel to be one of his best films. Rating: 8/10",9,2,13,14 March 2014
