Mission: Impossible III," King Cruise Conquers
","After the outstanding first film in the series - followed by the dire second instalment (just 'Woo' it?? Not on that occasion - just RUE it more like), this third movie ROCKS! From an alarmingly uncomfortable opening sequence, to some spectacular yet convincing action sequences (won't spoil it but I've GOT to get a fighter jet like that) to beautiful and stylish locations and people (Maggie Q?? Which planet was she born on? Planet Hot-damn-I-can't-catch my breath??), to welcome and familiar faces and clever little nods to the previous flicks - It's got it all. Including Simon Pegg and if you don't know who he is - just watch Shaun of the Dead. You won't forget him in a hurry. Naturally, it carries weight from Stellar Stars like Laurence (I'm so rich from the Matrix Trilogy I MAY get out of bed today) Fishburne; to the ALWAYS eminently watchable Mr Ving Rhames who on this outing has a much greater role - and the movie is all the better for it. As for Mr C - somebody should tell him he needs to share his energy with some unfortunates in the Sudan. He could light the way for Bedouin Tribesman for a year! He always gives 200% - and it shows in his Projects. Sure it's got some flaws but in all honesty, the man - and his colleagues - really are at the top of their game. To be a leader in the industry for a year is a major achievement; but to be a global leader for THREE decades is an unprecedented achievement! Brilliant. Top class. Celluloid Platinum. Long live the King.",10,0,1,5 May 2006
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Top Class!
","After the bitterly disappointing mashed-potato-like-dross that was Avengers 2: Age of Ultron, I felt compelled to come on here and write a fantastic review - just to remove the rancid taste of disappointment from my mouth. I watched Captain America 2 ages ago - but forgot to leave a review.Thankfully, The Winter Soldier is EVERYTHING The Age of Ultron is NOT! Fantastic script. Great character development. Just the right equilibrium between drama and humour. And beautifully set action pieces. Sam Jackson was fantastic in the stunning opening sequence. The legendary Robert Redford was utterly superb but let's face it: He's never let a viewer down yet. Chris Evans - dependable as always - carried the film on his broad shoulders effortlessly (and that perfectly conveys just how much work MUST have gone in to the film to make it all look so seamless and organic); the secondary villain was threatening yet 3 dimensional in that you felt sympathy towards him; and Anthony Mackie as The Falcon rocked it! Again, his action set-pieces were well thought out and utterly exhilarating in their execution. In summary: One of the BEST Marvel films ever. In a word: FANTASTIC!",10,4,9,21 May 2015
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Kicks A**!
","This film could have been a mess like Spiderman 3 but Tim Story deftly navigates the multiple stories quickly and efficiently from scene to scene. It was in danger of becoming fairly complicated if adhered to strictly ala the Comic Books. What Story did was balance out the film time, budgetary pressures, target audience attention, Studio hidden pressures, etc etc and at times perhaps TOO quickly rocket from scene to scene; but you know what - this movie works. It does exactly what it says on the tin. It's a movie about fictional Superheroes - not real life heroes like Gandhi, Mandela, etc which would require detailed analysis and depth. This movie gives us what we expect and demand. Namely, a Summer blockbuster which zips past joyously quickly at just over 90 minutes - without so much as pausing for breath! Perfect. Bring on FF3!",10,11,24,18 June 2007
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Disappointing
","OKI bought a 3d TV JUST because I wanted to watch The Avengers at home. I watched it so many times - the bluray became blurry! This was after having watched it three times with different people in the cinema!Fast forward with pee-holding excitement to Avengers 2: Age of Ultron. How can I summarise this without boring you with a shopping list? Basically: Everything right about the first Avengers - was MISSING in this one. As promised - I'll stop complaining there.LOVED Paul Bettany though. He was superb as always in whatever he appears in! As was - surprisingly - Elizabeth Olsen (and I thought she'd be terrible - but she was actually excellent. All fragile, deadly, heartfelt, deep, angst-ridden, quiet rage and fear).Overall? Put the soul back into the next one please. Missing the character development and warmth of a Whedon picture. Oh yeah - and please bring back Loki. Thanks X",2,11,26,21 May 2015
Wedding Crashers," Crashing In All The Way To The Bank!
","This is the film that truly made Vince Vaughn a star. I had always been a fan of Owen Wilson (and was always slightly delighted that whatever film he turned up in - no matter how weak its material - he was always able to JUST pull it off in a really likable way); But with Vaughn, it always felt that he was a huge star in the making - and you really wanted him to do it - but it just never seemed to happen. Until Now.The Wedding Crashers is that perfect mix of adult humour, classy settings and outright, laugh-out-loud, slightly pee-your-pants slapstick. I haven't laughed this hard since my girlfriend's battle-axe Mother decided to emigrate! The all-star line-up are perfectly cast - with a downright brilliantly ridiculous cameo from Will (how DOES he get away with it?) Ferrell. Everyone is fantastic in their own right - from the brilliantly realistic animosity between Rebecca De Morny and Dwight Yoakam (with some GREAT lines) before the opening credits even roll - to the closing scenes which - although appearing to contain enough cheese to satisfy even the biggest deep-pan aficionado - really, simply, works.A platinum cast including the awesome Chritopher Walken, Keir o' Donnell, the always beautiful Jane Seymour (nicely bitter) and a host of others - but a special mention however MUST go to Isla Fisher. Apart from Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction - there has never been a more sexy, but impossibly scary Bunny Boiler as that portrayed by Ms Fisher (or is it Mrs Baron Cohen?) in this film. The irony here is that opposites really can attract - and sometimes you find exactly what you were looking for in a person - without realising it's precisely what you wanted. All in all - a really sweet film - without the sugar. Absolutely priceless!",10,8,11,2 December 2006
Alien: Covenant," Sir Ridley's Ego Ruining His Legacy
","Without a doubt, Sir Ridley Scott has more than earned his place among the pantheon of Hollywood giants who have blessed the silver screen with their mammoth talent.However, as with the legendary Chaplin, Hitchcock, Kurosawa, Sturges, Hawks et al - sometimes too many 'yes people' around them didn't have the guts to politely and constructively say - 'Enough.'Sir Ridley is actually luckier than the aforementioned. His filmmaking - as a whole - is still spectacularly dazzling. He is, unquestionably, a genius.There is however, one intellectual property he must let go of. Urgently.His vision for the Alien franchise has long since expired. The stories are lazy, crass, boring and worst of all, hackneyed, poorly acted, poorly structured, cliches. A horrendous, depressing parody of the laser-sharp, dna altering, platinum quality shocker that originated the franchise.Partner up with a dynamic, fresh, hungry and younger filmmaker who worships your franchise, get likewise writers who are respectful of the work of Dan o' Bannon. Get set designers to gorge on the work of HR Geiger. Slash the budget and effects in place of a tightly driven narrative - and for goodness sakes - drop the tedious Prometheus origin story. Nobody cares. It's been told to death. That horse has long since expired.Instead, bring back the nostalgia. Bring back the character of Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) kicking ass. Let her **** up Aliens again as if they were exposed by the 'Me too' movement.You used to take our breath away. Your vision led the world. In other films you still do. Just not with this franchise. Make it happen again. Collaborate to inject new life - before your next Alien project is DOA.With much love and respect always,
ZOFH",1,2,4,15 August 2019
