Hereditary," WT!! Starts well but then gets really weird
",This movie starts quite well and has some good ideas but the ending just gets really weird. I like a good horror movie that makes me not want to get up in the middle of the night. This one had that until the last 20 minutes. It was like the writers didn't know how to finish it so gave it a really stupid ending. What a shame as it had potential.,4,0,1,16 March 2019
