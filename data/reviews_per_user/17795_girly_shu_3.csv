The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," I don't understand the bad reviews. The movie was good and different than the first 2.
",I honestly do not understand the bad reviews. I thought that the movie was really good. The acting was perfect. Everyone did a wonderful job. Jennifer Lawrence is very convincing. I loved Julianne Moore as President Alma Coin - she did a great job representing this cold and manipulative character. I think the first part was a great built-up. There was tension and some action enough to prepare you for the 2nd part. I think people are expecting Hunger Games 1 and 2 and this is why they get disappointed. This part was more about building up the tension and the frustration. I have read the books and they are really good. I think they did a great job on the 1st part of the 3rd book.I suggest that you don't read the bad reviews and just go see it :),10,29,71,24 November 2014
We're the Millers," You are going to laugh!!!!
","We're the Millers is going to make you laugh. The movie is more hilarious than you would think. You will be surprise how creative some of those 'stupid', funny and ridiculous scenes are. The girls are doing a great job. Emma Roberts as an angry teen with a big mouth and Jennifer Aniston as a sexy stripper with mother instincts. Loved the stripper scenes with Jennifer who looks as hot as ever. Kenny (Will Poulter)is just so perfect for the part of virgin, sweet teenage guy and of course Jason Sudeikis as David - the drug dealer - is the one and only who can pull that character as good as he did. The Millers are just the perfect 'family'. They picked just the right people for this comedy. You can expect dirty, funny, sexy, ridiculous! Just go and see it so you can have a good summer laugh!",9,116,177,12 August 2013
Fifty Shades of Grey," There are some flaws but overall I enjoyed it.
","To start with I would say that the movie is hit and miss. I do not agree with the one-star reviews though. There is more to that 'porn' as some people are describing it and limiting it to. Some of the lines were a little ridiculous I agree. And some of the lines were pretty funny! So to me it was a little bit of comedy, erotica, drama, romance. I am still deciding how I feel about Dakota Johnson as Anastasia. At first I thought she was super awkward and shy and boring. But I think she became more and more confident as the movie progressed. She has some witty and funny lines. Jamie Dornan did a great job as Christian Grey. Of course as I woman I thought he was super hot and in the sex scenes, which by the way are done very well, he knew exactly what he was doing. I have not read the book so I did not know that it's not just about the sex in it. But the movie is clearly revealing that there is a deeper reason as to why Christian is how he is. I think the first movie was an exciting opening and definitely makes me want to see more and know what's going to happen next. I have friends that have read the books and say there is more unexpected to come. So I will definitely see the other movies.",7,3,7,20 February 2015
