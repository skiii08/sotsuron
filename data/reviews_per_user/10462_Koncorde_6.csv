Gremlins," Horror gone B-Movie funny...
","...You watch it and find yourself sucked into an otherwise story by numbers movie (hey, the old guy says 'no sunlight, water or food after midnight' so you're warned what to expect already).  Main criticism of course is its lack of focus on the hilarious antics of the evil Gremlins (something the sequel did a little better) who destroy a good portion of a town, but aren't seen nearly enough to make you detest them - instead they're little more than pests.The level of gore is surprising, which is how you can tell that this isn't technically a 'kids' movie, so care should be taken with young children (but saying that I'd have been 7 when I saw this and had no problem....but then Nightmare on Elm Street might have desensitised me a bit by that time) but it's essential viewing if only so that you can watch the sequel too.",10,1,2,17 July 2003
Unbreakable," Enjoyable if disjointed...
","...we've owned this film, 6th Sense and Signs as part of a triple DVD set, but it took until I caught a portion of it on TV to actually bother watching it on DVD properly.Everything about it unfortunately lacks substance.  You can never believe any of the characters (half expecting Samuel to turn around every 10 seconds and say 'Do you know what they call a comic in France - 'Le big comique'.' and Willis to do his 'Yippie Ki Yay Mo.Fo's' never leads to any great suspense) and Spencer Treat Clark doing his best impression of the snivelling on trick pony Haley Joel Osment is just taking the biscuit.It cuts and chases around with the camera in some faux CSI style, without any apparent understanding of the mechanics and what they achieve - often throwing the films pace.But if you ignore that you get a reasonable attempt at infusing the comic world with the real world (not the other way around though) leaving Willis as something of a bemused passenger discovering the truth behind the universe.Not that you ever really know the truth or anything.....s'all relevant.",Null,0,1,15 February 2004
The Aviator," So close...
","Scorsese for me has always been one of those directors capable of bringing together actors of all different backgrounds and character and working them into a story effortlessly. His grasp of direction is usually flawless, artistic but always controlled. Yet he has never, again for me, produced a single piece of work I would call complete despite some fantastic performances from various actors.This is yet another in the long list of 'so close'.The film is good, great by many standards. But the story is weak, even if the central character is engrossing (and Di Caprio - who hasn't had a good role since Gilbert Grape - shows at last some of his talent by giving a great performance) and the supporting cast so strong. It just isn't carried anywhere (few biopics ever are though, 'Chaplin' really is the only one that springs to mind).I do recommend it, I rate it highly enough to give it a 7 and the closing half an hour is great - but there's no ending to speak of.",7,0,0,16 July 2005
In the Name of the Father," Whatever side of the divide you may sit...
","...this film is spot on.  For the sake of this film I sit on the British side of the line, for I've seen the terror and the immediate fall out even though I had nothing to do with the history leading up to it.  Regardless, the acts of a mindless few doesn't ever justify the gross abuse of power seen and portrayed in this film.The British who view it can't help but be appalled at the behaviour of their own because we do pride ourselves on having a fair and balanced legal system.  The Irish who view it can't help but applaud the rare nature of a film making a stand from their side.But one side shouldn't attack the other over opinions on a film such as this; neither the British for the inaccuracies or the Irish for the Brits apparent refusal to accept something very wrong was done in our name. 
Instead it should just be appreciated as a film that makes a very valid point, in a very effective manner.",9,3,5,30 July 2004
Zulu," A tribute to both sides of an uneven war.
","ZULU steers away from making one side good and one side bad.  Okay, we identify with the British troops in the face of insurmountable odds and all that - but you have to admire the ZULU warriors all the more for going up against them unfalteringly and the 'pan' across their fallen bodies isn't so much a moment of joy for the Brits saying 'Ha, look how many we've killed of you lot' as opposed to clearly showing what an awful waste of life it all actually was.The film clearly marks out why the British Army was as good as it was. Organisation.  Okay, we got butchered a couple of times, but when placed in a position with time to ready ourselves the British forces where pretty unbeatable.  One of the huge advantages being the fact that often we were going up against quite primitive 'warriors' with even more primitive weapons.  The whole staying smart, obeying orders and keeping in line, firing in order helped to saved all those mens lives and is a neatly condensed show of arms to everybody out there.  Each setpiece of British organisation re-inforces just how good they were, just how well they were drilled and just how murderous they could be with their efforts.The film clearly marks out why the ZULU forces wasn't quite so good.  It wasn't a lack of courage or absence of valour, it was simply down to the fact that they were outclassed weapon and organisation wise.  Okay, they made pretty well organised charges and all that, but against rifles that's just cannon fodder.  But as is pointed out by the Dutch guy, they're merely counting your guns.  The ZULU's in the film aren't daft guys in furry underpants, they're the bravest warriors ever seen (or ever likely to be seen).  Well organised forces wilted in the face of British troops during that period, they didn't.  The fact they salute the British and walk away merely adds to their nobility and patheticises the British efforts - eventually they would have crumbled, the British would have lost against such odds if the Zulus had pressed all at once.  They didn't.  They walked away saluting the British effort.  That moment alone, with Caine blazing about how they're being taunted and the Dutch guy chuckling to himself struggling to believe what is actually taking place is the icing on the cake of the gradually increasing tension.For a moment of absolute spine tingling tension you can't beat the ZULU singing being countered by the Welsh Choir of voices.  It's an equaliser as such, a moment of contrast and compare between the rigid red suited Brits and the tribal shield clapping chanting.John Barry's music is a constant presence and always perfectly suited to the moment, I'd be interested to know the content of the ZULU chants though, whether they are authentic (which I figure they are) or simply picked out by the director for looking the most intimidating.Top film, no insult to anybody.",Null,14,14,16 February 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Good - but far from perfect.
","Problem with LOTR films is that they are always going to be compared to the books and peoples imaginations - and those of us with better imaginations than others often think of cooler things they'd rather have seen in the movie than others, or shown in different ways.Getting away from that what you have isn't worth a film.  It's a slice of a slice of a slice of a greater whole that was never going to be perfectly encapsulated into 12 movies - let alone 3 and let alone 3 with sum total of 3 years planning taking place prior to making the first film and then a continuous sequence of production.  That doesn't lend kindly to perfection by any stretch of the imagination - and it shows.  Because it's only a slice if you watch it and haven't got the background to fill in the gaps then all you have is a mediocre story, mediocre emotional value and very little that you can actually get your teeth into.  You never get any kind of attachment to the characters - Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas are getting on my nerves already and I was banking on Jackson straying completely from the book and bumping those two off - meanwhile Frodo and Sam look destined to lead a clandestine homosexual arrangement, because that's what it is - a big boys book of camping in woods and fending off mystical beasties.Maybe if you watch all 3 films end to end it'd make sense - but right now the first film stands alone as an excellent piece of work, almost worthy of Tolkiens words whilst the second film goes back on the principle of 'enlightenment' and filling in background gaps by throwing everything in quickly and with little or no care for the people who haven't read the book. It sooooooo desperately needed a voice over, a few more historical flashbacks, a little more time introducing and attention paid to rather important characters such as Boromirs brother etc.Anyway.  CGI scenery is 'good' so long as you ignore the glaring wobbly bits (such as the Big Gate scene closing on the ranks of filed evil men) dodgy editing and inability (Still!) to get shadows and depth right.  Sometimes matte paintings are the way to go if you can't realistically do it using a computer.  I know that doesn't allow for big panning motions across mighty castles on hilltops etc but quite frankly I don't care much for this scenic extravaganza, I'd rather them cut the wasteful 15 or so minutes of watching people run, or horses slowly ride etc and have some background info - or at least give us a voice over with some pointers in the meantime.  CGI creatures are on the whole well done, but again look like plastecine (or is plastacine?).  Gollum stands apart in this respect as he is actually surprisingly well done.  However, the artists could have done with actually 'looking' at the effects the lighting in the scene had on the actors. Too often you'd see Sam or Frodo with their face half in shadow, then Gollum sticking out like a sore thumb because his 'shadow' doesn't come from any source within the scene.Oh - and with all this CGI going on, nobody thought of fixing Legolas eyes. If we're going to see them so often in the film as he stares off into the middle distance and makes some profoundly obvious statement - then the least they can do is make them the same colour throughout.Despite all this - it ranks as probably the greatest Sword+Fantasy type film.  Unfortunately considering it's only up against B-Movie Conan and the hit'n'miss Legend and the lacklustre Dungeons&Dragons this isn't much to brag about.  However, it does go an awful long way towards making Sword+Fantasy movies respectable.  Hopefully someone will now be brave enough to take on the far more movie friendly 'Dragonlance Chronicles' (Dragons of Autumn Twilight, Winter Night, Spring Dawning etc) and do them proper justice.It's an 8.  But only because I have an odd taste in movies admittedly, which would put Spaceballs as a 10.  I apologise in advance for this travesty of judgement.",Null,4,6,29 August 2003
