Alien 3," A breath of fresh air
","After James Cameron's overblown, overlong, Aliens, complete with incompetent marines, cutesy kid and dreadful dialogue, Alien3 is like a breath of fresh air.Despite Fox's butchering of Fincher's original vision, the assembly cut, although not perfect, repairs the damage done by the theatrical release and a lot more besides.The Golic sub plot has been replaced and there many extended scenes, many of which are a vast improvement on their shortened versions and in a film from the Alien series there are unexpected tender moments highlighted by Goldenthal's magical score.Highly recommended.",8,5,90,29 February 2008
Alien," One of the best films of it's decade, or indeed any other.
","With its influences in 50s creature features, Dan O'Bannon and Ron Shusett's 'small Roger Corman movie' seemed an unlikely world-wide phenomenon.But after Brandywine partners read and refined the script things started moving. Add a little corporate paranoia, a highly visual director, a Swiss manic depressive artist apparently obsessed with sex and death, and probably the best art design ever, at that time, and Fox had a hit on their hands.The list of people responsible for this is long, the brilliant cast, David Giler and Walter Hill's revised script, Gordon Caroll's belief that within this monster feature chrysalis there was an A movie forming, O'Bannon's overseeing of the art department, including Ron Cobb, Chris Foss, Mobius and H.R. Giger, and Ridley Scott's masterful, almost documentary-like direction all contributed to one of the best films of it's decade, or indeed any other.I feel privileged that I able to witness this in the cinema in 1979 and although the cinema has long gone, the memory of that first viewing remains.It was and still is the best cinema experience of my life.",10,2,10,29 February 2008
Aliens," Turophobia
","Although a thrilling first watch, repeated viewings are not kind to James Cameron's follow up to Ridley Scott's masterful Alien.The film starts well, but when Ripley journeys back to LV-426 she wakes up to find she's in been landed with a bunch of mouthy, incompetent marines and the film takes a downward turn, only to be lifted by the action scenes, all but one of which are handled well by Cameron, but the dialogue. Oh dear...If only Cameron had left the script details to David Giler and Walter Hill, instead we get a succession of cheesy one-liners and an end ripped straight from the original film.Enjoyable, to be sure, but avoid the bloated special edition if you suffer from turophobia.",8,0,8,29 February 2008
Prometheus," An 8, I think...No only 7
","I went to see Prometheus this afternoon in 3D and I have rather mixed views.There are some excellent performances, superb production design and cinematography, but I'm not sure if the sum of its parts add up to a satisfying whole.I think it was in an interview with Lindelof that he said that Prometheus was a mix of Alien and Blade Runner, but it seems to me that the central thread is much more in line with Blade Runner than Alien and the 'Alien' elements in the second half of the film are the ones that throw the film a little off course.That being said there are scenes in the film I'll never tire of watching and a couple I really wish weren't in it at all.I need to see it again before I can come to a definite conclusion. Provisionally 8/10 I've seen it a few times now and a 7 is the best it deserves.",7,4,9,2 June 2012
