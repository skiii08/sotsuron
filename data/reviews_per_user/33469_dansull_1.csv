E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Good, but not great
","Well, I saw the movie for the first time in it's re-released version, and though I did think it was quite a good movie, I can't really see why so many people think that it is so good.  The acting was okay, E.T. was (at least in the re-released version) convincing enough so as not to distract from the plot.  One problem I had was that it didn't really pull me into the story like some movies will. 7/10",7,2,4,30 March 2002
