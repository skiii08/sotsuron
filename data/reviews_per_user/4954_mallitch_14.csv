Black Swan," Very disappointing and vulgar
","This was supposed to be about art. This turns out to be a rude and cruel competition movie which can annihilate your senses. One may say it happens all the timethis is life. OK. Let it be so. But the cinematography is sick. The cuts, bruises, feathers growing from underneath the skin, blood, blood. WOW. And the fear in Nat's face when this is happening.I don't know if some of you ever visited The German Natzi Camp in Auschwitz. I was a toddler when they forced me to go there and since then occasionally I've had a nightmare. If I dreamt a nightmare like 'Black Swan', I would be quite sure that my subconscious and Auschwitz memories did it again to me.I am a grown man now. Seen lots of things. Now I've seen a film which main point is hurt, at least to those vulnerable. The CGI and formula has destroyed whatever artistically beautiful was meant to be in it. The film is disgusting, repulsive. Stay away if you have a similar background and fragility.",Null,7,14,24 July 2011
Minority Report," Another hot shot regrettably
","A view to a future, which may come true or not. A contribution to, say P.K.Dick's legacy, but not for real perhaps. Some say Steven Spielberg is a never grown up kid for the Hollywood entertainment factory. This film may promote their point. If one tries to convert a story of human life, its restlessness, unknown future, void ending against the ultimate eternal questions, Spielberg has failed so far for sure. His 'Report' is easy in the reading and unavoidably summed up in the 'happy ending'. I find it the very opposite thing to Dick's prose. He underlined our seclusion in our ultimate experiences, our specific and unique comprehension of the external input, the meaning of 'external', the unease, when balancing the choice between the real and elusive, and the rejecting of unnatural. It's a 'game' between our beliefs in God and the agnostics. Spielberg's made it easy to please the executives and audience. I do like the movie but it's far away from the Dick's prose and his message for us.",Null,1,2,14 September 2004
Seven Years in Tibet," Most comes at a price, you never know when.
","The story's of a Nazi German expedition to conquer Nanga Parbet in Himalayas. That should have been another example of the leading role of uebermensch in the Goebels's propaganda machine. The expedition is led by a selfish, edgy chap with his own unsteady background of sacrificing his wife and their to be born son for the trip to the mountains and glory. 'For love and glory' with one part missing. Folks fail to reach the peak, and are interned by the British, which triggers a line of escape tries. When he and his deputy manage to reach Lhasa he finds himself in another universe, where he is able to live with a little help of his growing up friend Dalai Lama. In the meantime he signs divorce papers and and thus makes one of his mates a pa to his son. When his deputy with clear conscience manages to fit in by marrying a cute, wise native girl, he is being cast about Dalai Lama as if in search for forgiveness of his son who he's lost for good at the moment. There are so many parallel themes and motives in the movie, that one couldn't possibly grasp, and review them in a few lines. The film is touching and underrated. If one wishes to go over the river and into the trees, try it, you won't be disappointed.",Null,2,4,16 February 2005
Closer," As time goes by
","The movie is awesome. Indeed it's a more mileage viewer that can appreciate all the turns and follow them. But the film did make it. It was long enough to put me to sleep, like some movies used to, but I was alert and present till the final titles. Julia's had all my prejudices. A famous, rich actress, working out on her potential potency. She used to be young, fresh and charming, but now the time for the characteristic roles had come. I was wrong. Julia's the jewel, which never loses its light and magnetism. Her soft smiles, barely distinguishable changes in the sculpture of her face are amazing. While watching the film I had a notion that most of time she wouldn't have dared speak. Her presence was her language. And I must confess I was wrong about her acting powers and abilities. Sorry Julia. Ms. Portman I've already seen in, say a movie span. She's grown older now to her advantage and created some real beautiful moments. The moments came and passed and after I left the theatre behind me, I realized that there's much for her to reach for and attain. With all her beautiful face, charming and suggestive pronunciation, she needs time to lift us up where we belong. In the movie she somehow reached the peaks and all of a sudden got tuned down for reasons unknown. Jude was good but for my taste his acting was too soft...womanish-like. His counterpart has been great especially while typing on his laptop to an unknown adventurous girl. Whoa. That was an adventure. It's hard to get a clear message from the film, and it's good. Life doesn't offer clear messages. From the other hand I am not sure if leaving a viewer at large, with hints uncertain should be considered a proper thing. Well...at least we might discover another angle while watching our lives, cause the movie's definitely not another cliff-hanger to see us fall. The time will tell. The movie's my best for 2004.",Null,2,4,30 January 2005
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Complete nonsense and waste of money.
",This is the ongoing obsession of leftists with female empowerment. How many females confronted the London bridge killer? Any records of similar activities? Hollywood is trying to tell us that we're all equals. And they are better. They are not. The film is a nonsense and a boring one.,Null,11,17,22 December 2019
Collateral," Take a break
","All memorable is the Tom's haircut. His grey hair looksfine at least. The plot's all Hollywood. Nothing that could pin you up to the screen. When you start snoring your neighbouring viewers, if any, wake you up. Good, when they go asleep, you can return the favour. A killer goes on a hunt when ordered and paid. A good citizen, involved accidentally as his cab driver tries to oppose. Ups and downs and the show must go on. The space must have been filled. Tommy looks much better than in 'Minority Report', but his appearance is a way poorer. It's the beginning almost when you can foresee how the story's going to end. If you care for a better time, give yourself a break.",Null,1,2,21 January 2005
The Hurt Locker," Waste of time
","I couldn't help compare this film with Ridley Scott's 'Blackhawk down'. Both films are military action flicks. But when Scott's film shows the seemingly psychologically indifferent amount of cruelty of war (it just happens as inevitable part of it), when all involved and their loved ones are simply victims, this one tries to build up an overview of human psychology. This policy of treating us a target of social manipulation has always made me upset.It has failed as far as I have been concerned because it is overly politically correct (which I do not condone because of its clearly manipulative goals). They want to pass a clear message, not a view to think over. I could call this a propaganda. In fact I do.",Null,17,25,10 March 2010
Moulin Rouge!," Follow your dreams
","Moulin Rouge. One of the hardest pieces of cake to bite when writing about. It's the musical aura, and the thing of talking about matters so obvious that they used to just slip away usually. A story of love and a force which when gets a hold of somebody, always wins. Death that is. All in a sound stage, all colourful, one moment an usual Hollywood, LA production, another moment European, or Eastern Seaboard heritage. A man falls in love with a courtesan. And when love is for the highest bidder there is no trust. Without trust there can be no love. There can be a broken heart though. When the final clash comes she... well you'd better see for yourself. The soundtrack's great. Ewan and Nicole doing their best to good effect. The supporting staff keeps up the pace. My fellow countryman is great too, singing 'Roxanne', and dancing a fantastic tango and mimicking narcoleptic attacks (with minor credibility). For me it's the unique case of a movie which everyone must watch and find oneself in there. The outstanding music score (U2's Bono and Sir Elton John also involved) and actors' performance make no snag.",Null,4,6,19 January 2005
The Mummy Returns," Patricia Velasquez is to stay
","Quite nice an action flick. Above all I shall remember Patricia Velasquez playing the bad girl of the movie.Whatever you say she's brought charm and womanish values to be seen in a high B class movie. While jokes and action scenes are simple and easy to follow, the CGI is no one's step above for early 2000s, the actress's made one visual footprint to remember with her sex appeal. Too bad she's not around to entertain us any further.The plot is simple and is not allowed to go on with all the discrepancies between faiths and manners.One can expect more to hear in the soundtrack, it's no Jerry Goldsmith any more. So... it's a plain return.",Null,1,1,8 September 2007
Where Eagles Dare," Where did they go?
","Having watched the film a hundred times or so I'm an expert in it one could expect. Frankly it's all but this. The reason is simple. I used to  well  take it, as my sleeping cure. The sleep disorder's been with me for many years now and it seems that its history has become a part of the cultural legacy of mankind. Thus if any one asks me a question about the lines or action I'll be in all mights to answer if they're included in the unwinding 20 minutes or so /lines that is/. Mr Eastwood's performance was notably that of a treebeard / why they didn't give him a chance I wonder /. Mr Burton was cool and said something I shall cherish to my dying day. Know what I've got on my mind? 'You're entitled to know nothing' that is. Some say it's an ageing movie and this should explain its downs. Probably so. But you know it worked as my sleeping med quite well. Doesn't this work to its advantage? I cannot reject my well known tool. So I love it and give it 6 stars. I shall not forget. And the comment is still standing and frank in 2009:)",Null,3,9,9 September 2004
Rosemary's Baby," A view to a ... up to you to decide
","I could wonder if the film is a psychological drama with the hints towards the maternity psychosis or a mainstream horror movie. But why should I ? All included is the load impressive enough to make an interesting reading /a quote from Basic Instinct; words of sympathy for Mr.Eszterhas, he's made me quit smoking/. I cannot sympathize with girls like Rosemary, because it's in row with my convictions, but the actors are really good here, and all of them. The theme of love was overpowering. Love for husband, child. Hmm, the child above all. The independent love with the sacrifice of the very own personal grounds upon which all had been built in past, was touching and hurting. It's so hard to bring it here in our lives. Farrow and Cassavetes made me believe they were in trouble as well as their support did /Gordon, Blackmer, Evans/. Occasionally Mia Farrow was overly realistic so that I was ready to sign off but I didn't. /though I must confess, the name, Mia that is, has a reservation for a soft spot in my heart/. And the final moments, with the baby crying in the cradle, were tears bringers as no other film had done so. With Krzysztof Komeda's lullaby came comfort and ease. A great movie mostly underestimated.",Null,0,2,13 April 2005
Blade Runner," A work of the masters
","The ultimate achievement for the sci-fi movies. 'Blade Runner' can hardly find a match. That cyberpunk reality which once inspired more than one PC game is exceptional. Harrison goes along the line as a hunter of human-like robots called replicants. What is human? What are we? What is the thing which makes us unique? You wanna know? Keep watching. Obviously Harrison falls in love with an android. Ms Sean Young playing as the android Rachel has made a centre of her website with the movie. Ewan McGregor reads the lines in 'Moulin Rouge': 'The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.' None of his discoveries, but can get a grip here. And the choreography requires an academy award. Rutger's done well too. His android is a killing machine and a lover losing his girl at the same time. The moment when he released the pigeon free along with his slowly speaking lines when he was dying, is one of few which ever made me reach out for my handkerchief. Give it a try.",Null,1,2,16 January 2005
Apollo 13," Failure is not an option
","The story of American race to the Moon is incomparable. At first it was a try to catch up with the Soviets, after that pass them. JFK knew well what he did. He wanted to settle that the democracy is superior to communism. He proved it also in outer space. One of Nasa achievements was saving lives of the crew of Apollo 13. And this is the story. Due to incompetence and neglect the crew of Apollo 1 died during a routine count down. Due to the human intelligence and good fortune Jim Lovell and his crew returned safely home. The movie is excellent. There are technical flaws of course but most of them are covered by live Lovell's commentary. And the story is about how every human being, sometimes against all odds, can survive activating the human will of survival and powers of our mind. The visual effects are of minor importance here. It's the actors, their faces, tone of their voices, their moves tell us the story. They did well. After I read Lovell's 'Lost Moon' and Kranz's 'Failure is Not an Option' /which quote was spitefully used on the NYT after the tragedy of Columbia/ I liked the movie even more. Dust in the wind we are. Such achievements like the conquest of the cosmos give our lives a bit of meaning, due to possible harvesting the assets by our children. Apollo 13 is a kind of record of such heroic efforts. Worth watching and thinking about.",Null,2,4,22 January 2005
Fantastic Four," Don't let them make a fool of you
","In the terms of the Fast Sweep /term being my old invention in the movie-making business/ the film is a real waste of time, idiotic in a special way. Some hail its CGI. You have never seen the productions of Lucas, Spielberg, and Jackson. Jessica Alba is a nice girl who suddenly was put in a hostile environment. None can build her career on a c*** like this. The idiotic plot, an ocean of inconsequence should knock all dinos down and away off the face of the earth. It's a miracle of her guts and apparel she's survived. The movie tries to be a heritage of Spiderman and a line of classics, I won't tire you with mentioning them , cause you know them all. I am not gonna go deeper into this because so frank the things need no nailing or hammering. They die naturally. If I ever showed up here and wrote the very lines, it's cause I'd made a mistake and took a little boy named Robert to watch the flick. His mom wasn't quite snoring in the movies and he is eager as always right now, but we all feel it was a lost timeso many things could have been done. So don't make the same mistake, and stay tuned on to the IMDb. So we could create the early warning Fast Sweep umbrella for the sake of our little ones in the first place and let them skip the dump.",Null,1,3,18 September 2005
