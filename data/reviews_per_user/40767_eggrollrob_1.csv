The Incredible Hulk," Best Hulk can Get
","I gave it 5 stars because as a movie, it was simply OK. Edward Norton once again brought a stellar acting performance to the screen. Liv Tyler on the other hand was at times very weak. The CGI was quite good, but not up to par as some of today's CGI movies. I only state that because it depends heavily on CGI and does a good, but not excellent job. It had a lot of good throwbacks to comic book readers too. In the end though, it was full of slow, almost stopping points, where nothing is given to the story. The action scenes were great, but not good enough to make me want to see this again. It may be worth spending $10 to see in theaters, but I wish I waited for DVD.",5,4,12,13 June 2008
