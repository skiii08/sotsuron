First Man," What a Thrill Ride
",I was a kid in the 60's and FM brought back all those memories of being glued to the TV watching the different launches and finally a walk on the moon. It's a beautifully filmed movie and gives a possible hint as to why Armstrong exhibited such a sour disposition at times. If you are 55 and over you are probably familiar with some of the main events of the movie and will enjoy this nostalgic ride but any younger there probably won't be much connection.,8,1,2,9 February 2019
The Hunger Games," Mildly Entertaining
","Spoiler Alert HG reminded me of an updated version of The Running Man. Kept expecting Arnold to jump out any moment. It even had the same kind of campy type Richard Dawson host.A couple tactical flaws that killed it for me was instead of waiting Katniss out under the tree they could have just set fire to it.Katniss had a bow and arrows. The other contestants had edged weapons. If she was as good a shot as touted then pick them off at a distance............. or gosh, maybe even when they're asleep. Surely she could have whacked the kid waiting around the supply pile when the others left",5,1,2,24 November 2014
The Irishman," Wake Me Up When It's Over
","I tried to like it. I really did but it was toooo much like Casino and Goodfellas and The Godfather and Once Upon A Time In America and, and, and ....... you get the idea. It was soooo slow too. I kept waiting for the hook but it never came.Aside from the above what was really distracting was the casting. Great actors. A veritable smorgasbord of the best but c'mon, there comes a point where the best make-up artist reaches their limits with their subjects. The actors were too old for their younger parts. It just came across as kind of comical. Not only that but you can't make people have younger voices. The elderly develop distinctive speech characteristics and it was very apparent especially when the actors were their younger characters.Sorry, didn't work for me.",5,5,13,29 November 2019
Bird Box," Formulaic
","Kind of interesting movie but the characters and progression of the story were pretty typical of any doom and gloom movie. What really killed it for me was the boat journey and the children surviving the rapids run. Really, who puts 5 year old's in a small boat without a lifejacket? That's not just taking creative liberty with the story, it's a major flaw.",6,0,1,3 February 2019
