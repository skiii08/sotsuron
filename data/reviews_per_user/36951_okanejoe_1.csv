Hereditary," Just not that good
","Am not going 2 give a long winded review of this film , as it's a bit predictable you can tell from the first 5 mins what direction the film is going in . Acting was good sometimes maybe a wee bit over done but that was the only reason for the 4 stars , plus any supposedly serious horror flick should not have most of the cinema laughing there heads of at the (so called edge of seat parts) it was just very average and it was finished like the writer got board and just said f##k it that will do the job .",4,3,6,14 June 2018
