Blade Runner 2049," Thinly spread.
","I believe they call this kind of film 'world building.' It's an apt description of the results of a talented production team using budget and effects to sustain a convincing environment in which you can immerse yourself. In my view, such is the potency of projects like this, actors are there primarily to compliment this imagined civilisation. In 1982, the original 'Blade Runner' achieved this perverse enigma very convincingly. Here all these years later, is the sequel.There was some mild controversy concerning original composer Vangelis not being assigned to provide a soundtrack for this, but Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer's score is impossible to fault. Vast, weird, laced with industrial swirls and chunky klaxons. Denis Villeneuve's direction is vast and eccentric, exactly as it should be, and the myriad of art directors ensure that the society, the interiors, the streets, even the habitat of Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford of course: grizzled, isolated, but still very much the same character we knew 35 years ago) is as impressive and spacious as it could be, an arena so absorptive and convincing, you can completely drink it in. My problem is, at 2 hrs 44 minutes, I really felt the need for a change of flavour after a while.It's impossible to be impressed at wonderful representations of an intricately carved tale for that length of time with no change of tone throughout, no levity, no particular sense of strident drama and only an irregular threat (Sylvia Hoek's splendid Luv). We have K (Ryan Gosling) and his girlfriend Joi (Ana de Armas, who, as a perfectly pouting, characterless hologram, is very good) and the very slow story of Deckard's 'improbable' child Rachael, and the long trek to locate her. It is good, but thinly stretched over such huge running time. Wrapping it in the beauty of almost overwhelming effects and atmosphere is an impressive compensation, however.",5,2,5,29 March 2018
The Ring," Spoilers follow ...
","This American remake of the Japanese original exceeds expectations. A 'troubled kid' always sends alarm bells ringing – often they are written and portrayed in such a precocious way that invites deep irritation rather than sympathy. Despite plenty of opportunities to exhibit such behaviour, young David Dorfman as Aiden mainly manages to avoid this. His mother Rachel (Naomi Watts) is actually less sympathetic than he is. She is an abrasive character who is very difficult to warm to.Luckily, 'The Ring' also resists being a 'teen' movie, despite opening with two adolescent girls talking about 'this videotape  that kills people'. Before long, as coincidence would have it, one of the girls has succumbed to that very curse.Overall, this is a good, spooky remake of the 1998 film. It cultivates its own unique brand of horror. Often shot in cold colours, much use is made of creeping water, blurred photographs and the everyday city portrayed as an oppressive, menacing environment. While the idea of videotapes is suddenly archaic, it actually gives the oncoming horror a nostalgic, creepy feeling that, for example, a Blu-Ray just wouldn't provide. The 'subliminal' imagery on the tape is also a very sinister, abstract series of events. You don't know what it all means, but it certainly doesn't look cheerful.Gore Verbinski's direction is very effective, building up a level of tension from less than obvious means. Views of tower-blocks, rain-swept streets and boxed-in people leading desolate lives help create an isolated world. Hans Zimmer's wonderful musical score also promotes the notion of seclusion, with echoing piano minimalism, notes like raindrops. The central idea of Rachael hearing about a videotape that kills people, and then watching the tape and inviting Aiden's father Noah (Martin Henderson) to watch it too, takes a lot of justification in logical terms and questions her intelligence. I'm not happy with the lack of explanation of this. Does she do this deliberately? In horror, stupid people do stupid things.The impenetrable images on the tape are shadowed throughout the film, providing a certain, slowly unravelling degree of clarity. And yet it isn't until the troubled Samara (Daveigh Chase) is mentioned, an adopted girl with deadly psychic abilities, who seems in spirit, to be responsible for the doings of the curse, do Aiden's 'troubles' become clearer - he has a kind of kinship with her.The standout scene, the moment the whole film has been leading up to, is a true classic horror moment. It's more spectacular than the scene in the original, but more or less retains the intimacy of Samara's singular mission: she's coming for you. First out of image of the well, then – blurred and the image fracturing – towards the television screen; then, impossibly through the screen and into reality. It's a blisteringly good moment of pure horror.",8,1,1,13 October 2016
Hereditary," Enjoyable and delirious.
","Of course you could, if you wanted to, lump much of 'Hereditary' in with the many other 'is there something supernatural afoot, or is it all in the mind' horror films that exist. But such is the slow-burning set-up, the very convincing performances and the assuredly weird direction (from Ari Aster, who also wrote this), that the resultant filmic experience is so much more.My favourite performance, in some impressive company, is that of young Alex Wolff as Peter, son of Steve and Annie Graham (Gabriel Byrne and Toni Collette) and brother to poor Charlie (Milly Shapiro). Whilst Peter and his mother seem most susceptible to the demonic mischief going on, whilst Steve remains scared but sceptical, it is Peter who evokes most sympathy, even though he has a terrible guilty secret.Throughout this 127 minute experience, I made several attempts to pause the DVD to fix a drink. Such was the power of the film, it remained unfixed. Whilst his doesn't perhaps measure up to all the hype and positivity heaped upon it (it has been set alongside 'The Exorcist' and 'The Omen'), it is nevertheless, an extraordinarily powerful and retrained horror story. Restrained because, for all the fevered emotion and tragically disintegrating personalities on display, there is relatively little gore or special effects. What there is, however, is exactly right.Al of these things push the finale into dizzying heights of surreal hellishness. If you have any interest in horror, and especially if you may find yourself disillusioned by much current popular horror output, this two hours will make you horrifically happy.",8,2,3,31 January 2019
Train to Busan," Spoilers follow ...
","This begins with one of the best pre-credit scenes I've seen in a while, featuring a deer knocked down and apparently killed by a flustered van driver. Moments later, the crumpled body in the road judders back into life, struggling to stand. As it does so, we see its eyes – dead and milky. The creature has joined the ranks of the living dead! Next we meet sulking child Soo-an (Kim Su-an), who is upset because her father Seok-woo (Gong Yoo) works all the time and spends no time with her. I have a problem with this kind of thing, and other similar scenes in other films. Perhaps the child would be less brattish if the parents gave up work and instead of a WII (or two) to play with, she had a stick and a clementine. Hardly! 'Dads get all the bad rap and no praise,' says big soft husband Sang-hwa (Dong-seok Ma) at one stage. Seok-woo, however, has his own story to tell  Anyway, this distant father and child are but two passengers who board the train to Busan, amid news reports of violence and rioting in the streets, and also a wayward passenger exhibiting symptoms of a strange and deadly disease.And we're off. Whilst the rapid transformations of many passengers into zombies relies perhaps too heavily on the actors' facial mannerisms and comes across often as 'over-enthusiastic' acting, there's no denying the effect of an enclosed body of people reverting into killers in some tensely choreographed scenes.My favourite character might well be Michael Ripper-like Yon-suck (Kim Eui-sung), self-serving CEO who does everything, and betrays everyone, in order to survive amidst the spitting, fast-moving zombie creatures. In one of my favourite scenes, the ringtone of a mobile phone in another carriage is used to successfully deflect the attentions of the ravenous pack. Watching them charging as one toward the source of the sudden, tinny music, is very effective.Every possible drop of tension is wrung out into the running time. For a while whilst watching 'Last Train to Busan', I felt there was something holding it back from greatness. Brilliant direction, acting and urgent pacing – however, I couldn't get completely immersed in it. And then, somewhere along the way, that changed and I was hooked. The tension is impossible to resist. What a journey!",7,3,5,16 March 2017
Nightcrawler," Spoilers follow ...
","The most horrific aspect of this film – and it is terrifying – is the fact that the main thrust of the storyline is not too far from the truth. The media, its lack of morals and sympathy for victims of crime, is attacked on no uncertain terms through the career trajectory of Louis Bloom, a small time criminal who has aspirations of success. Also included within the story's framework is how the career options of someone from 'the wrong side of town' are only pursued with the aid of superhuman cruelty and lack of regard for others.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Bloom brilliantly, with piercingly wide-eyed intensity and a staccato delivery of lines of dialogue restricted to only the bare bones of the subject in hand, his intent and the likely outcome of his endeavours. Every conversation is presented as a last-minute business deal, like that of an eternal car salesman unable to switch off, but on a grand scale. Every intricately constructed audacity is accompanied by a wide smile, either of arrogance or warmth – either way, it is hugely disarming. Writer and Director Dan Gilroy has said that Lou exhibits all the traits of a sociopath, and is on the autism and Asperger's spectrum, although nothing is ever addressed or specified. Instead, it is deliberately left to the audience to work out reasons for his manic social behaviour.Employing the homeless Rick (Riz Ahmed), he hacks into police radio messages to gain access to crimes the moment they have happened – the bloodier the better – and films the results. Then he presents his footage to hard-nosed mogul, Nina, with whom he very logically points out he would like to have a relationship. She finds Lou's complete lack of humanity appealing, and the footage he provides ensures they both appear to have a successful partnership, career-wise – but utilising methods so heartless, even seen-it-all-before Detective Frontieri (Michael Hyatt) is appalled. But Lou's methods are so blatant and meticulous, she cannot do anything about him – he and his activities are, as it were, hiding in plain sight.When Nina eventually gives into Lou's 'charms', she accepts his employment opportunity and promotion almost as a sexual, spiritual thing, cementing not only his illustrious future, but hers as well, personally and (most importantly) as a business proposition. That the film ends with Lou and Nine thriving in their appalling way of providing news stories at the expense of anything approaching empathy, is telling indeed, and markedly close to the truth of such things.",7,1,1,1 December 2016
Split," Spoilers follow ...
","Two smartphone distracted girls and their 'weird' friend are kidnapped by an unknown assailant who carries out the action without any emotion whatsoever.'Barry' is a model employee. He's been ill, but is better now. Doctor Fletcher (Betty Buckley) says this. We learn of 'Barry's' disorder because Fletcher is trying to widen awareness for his condition. The information about what is known as 'DID' is staggered throughout, at length, and her scenes are interspersed with 'Barry' and his other personalities presenting themselves to his three prisoners. One of these is an upper-class woman called 'Patricia', another is an irritant called 'Hedwig', another is a nuisance called 'Dennis' (who likes to watch girls dance naked). In reality, his name is Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy), and he has 23 personalities.Despite claims that, for example, if one personality is a weight-lifter he possesses the strength of a weight-lifter whilst other shared personalities do not, McAvey doesn't have the physical presence to portray anyone that couldn't just be over-powered by the three girls – or even just one of them (with a more sustained battering than just hitting him once and then turning their back on him, something that happens more than once). Despite the theatrical rolling eyes, the lisp, the change of clothes, he simply isn't frightening. His endless talking about himself makes it clear that his characters are a lot more interesting to him than to the audience – or at least, this member of it. I can appreciate a committed performance, but sadly he leaves me cold.Perhaps to balance out Kevin's multiple characteristics, the three girls have only one personality between them. Being the allegedly 'weird' one of the trio, it is Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy, who had been so good in 2015's 'The Witch') to whom 'Dennis' is attracted, because of course weirdness is an elite exclusive club that joins every outsider together, provided you're pretty enough ('the broken are the more evolved,' apparently). Luckily for flesh fans, one of Kevin's personalities suffers from OCD, necessitating the young captives to remove much of their 'dirty' clothing. Another box ticked.There have been accusations that 'Split' is offensive to sufferers of mental health disorders. In an age where being offended is a competitive sport, presumably any piece of fiction involving death, for instance, is offensive to anyone who has ever suffered bereavement and therefore 'shouldn't be allowed'. This is a point of view that stifles creativity, fiction, drama and/or many levels of art. That is not the problem with 'Split' in my view. It is an idea that is ripe with potential but simply stretched out very thinly over almost two hours with very little incident. In fact, the kidnapping of three girls is the only incident. Endless scenes of talking about 'Barry's' condition isn't entertaining, frightening or effecting. It very quickly becomes dull and stays that way.Director M. Night Shyamalan had a great success with 'The Sixth Sense' in 1999, especially its twist ending. Subsequently, all his films have ended with a similar surprise, each one less effective than the last. If you make it to the end of this, there is a revelation that (SPOILERS) Kevin's affliction appears to be supernatural. 'The Beast' is physically bulkier than his other personalities, can hop from wall to wall and is impervious to bullets. This ends with a reference to Shyamalan's 'Unbreakable' via a Bruce Willis cameo which pre-supposes you are on familiar terms with that film, which is presumptuous, as this is not billed as a sequel.",2,122,299,2 February 2017
It Follows," Spoilers follow ...
","We begin this with the sight of a pretty teenage girl in her shorts and underwear and high-heels, running away from something only she can see. Instant alarm bells ring with the probability that this will be just another glitzy, ditzy, horror-lite involving vacuous catwalk lovelies being stalked by a nasty man in a mask.There are a lot more teens-in-shorts before it becomes apparent this isn't quite the shallow candy-floss I was dreading. This comes about with the courtship of blond Jay Height (Maika Monroe) and Hugh (Jake Weary), admirably waiting until their second date before having sex, during which Hugh passes on his 'affliction'. A similar passing on of the curse occurs with Greg (Daniel Zovatto), the next in line to have sex with Jay.This seems to be a movie for teens by teens, where mundane anarchy runs moderate in a world where parents probably exist but are never there. Reminiscing about where they had their first kiss/beer in tiny, scratchy lost little voices alternating with scenes where they fall into lightweight sex seems like juvenile sensationalism to me. When the apparitions appear, there are moments of tension accompanied by an enigmatic 'retro' musical score by a collective called Disasterpiece. The finale has echoes of the Japanese 'Ringu 2 (1999)' in its setting.Finally Jay gets to have sex with Paul (Keir Gilchrist), which may or may not pass on the curse. The very concept of a vague threat passed on by half-dressed young people coupling has a crassness that stops this film breaking out of its self-imposed 'teen fodder' stable of titillation, despite the interesting and well executed sense of occasional threat.",4,1,3,3 November 2017
Paranormal Activity," Spoilers follow ...
","The effects of 'The Blair Witch Project (1999)' should never be underestimated in my view. With it came to many peoples' attention a whole new way of telling (mainly horror) stories: found footage. It was a phenomena, a huge low-budget hit. The inevitable backlash from the fickle public mainly whinged about the effects of 'shaky' webcam making the delicate souls in the audience feel queasy. Imagine then, if a film could be told using static security cameras endlessly filming every room in a haunted house. Perfect! For a limited time, it was certainly very effective.Katie and Micah live in the unlikeliest haunted house. No dank corridors or Victorian era décor – this is a thoroughly modern homestead devoid of dank shadows and possessed cellars. The couple are likable and real, and Katie Featherstone and Micah Sloat are naturalistic performers and have a certain casual chemistry. The production is genius in its simplicity. Watching stilted views of familiar rooms command the attention, dare the audience to examine every inch of the scene for any sign of unnatural movement – and even if nothing happens, there is growing tension merely in being so drawn into it.Micah's scepticism in the face of visiting psychic (Marc Fredrichs) marks him out quite early as fairly vexatious, especially when Katie seems to have been sensitive to paranormal activity from a young age. And yet every horror film needs a sceptic. I remember being very irritated by him when I first saw this, but watching again, I find he is a lot more understanding than I gave him credit for.Unspectacular occurrences are a lot more effective because they are filmed as 'live', and we get the couple's instant, undiluted reactions to them. The scene where Katie is simply standing beside the couple's bed, staring at Micah's sleeping form, doesn't sound much on paper, but is incredibly sinister. Such moments, gradually built up throughout, are simple and unnerving – far more so in this film than in the numerous sequels and prequels, which desperately introduce new characters and build unreasonably on the 'curse' (which is not that interesting) to try to maintain the interest. To my mind, the only sequel that works is 2014's 'The Marked Ones', because it is a fairly self-contained ghost story in its own right.Yet 'Paranormal Activity' should have remained a very effective one-off, in my view. Its huge success persuaded Paramount Pictures, who had bought the film from its original independent distributors, to add a new ending, which would then lead into further numerous ways of wringing money from what had become a new franchise.At the end of my first viewing of this, I had to turn all the lights on in every room, just to make sure there wasn't a figure standing there. A sure sign the film has done its job ?",7,0,0,19 May 2017
Sinister," Spoilers follow ...
","I enjoyed 'Sinister 2' so made the move to watch its prequel – to find I'd actually seen it before and had forgotten. I'm not sure what that says about me or the film. It doesn't avoid what the sequel managed to avoid – the curse of the bratty kid. In fact, both children belonging to Ethan Hawke's Ellison Oswalt are pretty obnoxious at times. As Bad Things happen, the children become more precocious. This is a difficult problem, and one that can actually ruin a film for me. Troubled children don't have to be petulant, do they? Luckily, they don't go on to play a huge part in the story.Earning him the chagrin of the local constabulary, Oswalt moves into the house where previously, gruesome murders have taken place. Unfortunately, his wife and offspring are not told about this history. He has moved himself and the family here so he can research the horrific incidents for a book he is writing. He also finds an ally in Deputy 'So & So' (James Ransone), who is the one cast member to appear in the sequel.'Sinister' is a fairly routine haunted house horror a couple of notches above the usual 'family in peril' fare, lifted by the performances of Hawke and Juliet Rylance as his English-but-American-speaking wife Tracy. It is somewhat overlong and slow-moving, but I don't really have a problem with that. Oswalt trips down the familiar path of encroaching obsession and insanity, a descent sprinkled with the occasional ghost-faced child. The main villain, the Gothic and spectral Bughuul, makes a fleeting appearance and is pretty menacing, making me wonder why the character isn't used more.I actually prefer the sequel. The production seems tighter and less traditional, as recompense for a lack of a 'name' lead. Both films have notable musical soundtracks; this deliciously dark OST is by Christopher Young.",5,0,1,24 November 2017
Don't Breathe," Spoilers follow ...
","Bad'uns, living in a run-down part of Michegan, dreaming of surfing in California – Rocky (Jane Levy), Alex (Dylan Minnette) and loud-mouth Money (Daniel Zovatto) make a living from committing small time robberies. Smoking pot, using expletives and sex jokes in front of minors, including Rocky's little sister Diddy, the three ruffians decide to improve their shambling lives by robbing a house owned by blind war veteran Norman Nordstrom (Steven Lang) with $300,000 and a big, slobbering dog.The money is compensation he received following the death of his daughter, who was run down by wealthy Cindy Roberts (Franciska Törőcsik). Nordstrom is devastated and bitter that she should be let off her crimes so lightly.I love films that present a 'world within a world' - that is, an isolated utopia hidden in plain sight: Norman's home, which he rarely leaves (as established early on), is a dark sprawling private hell personalised to his needs and advantage. Outside, the sun shines and life continues. Inside, anything can happen, and no-one may ever know. When the three would-be robbers enter this world, it isn't long before one of them (Money, I'm glad to say) is despatched. For Rocky and Alex, trouble is only just beginning Scenes often begin with blurred shots or extreme close-ups that obfuscate the new perils the characters find themselves in, revealing every desperate detail with an agonising (and deliberate) slowness. Writer/Producer/Director Fede Alvarez is clearly a name to look out for. 'Evil Dead (2013)' composer Roque Baños's wonderful music score is exceptional also, a collection of moody, occasionally screeching instrumentation that really sells the growing unease. The discovery of Cindy Roberts, bound, gagged and pregnant, is shocking. She took away Norman's child, so he thinks it is only right she provides him with a new one. Except her death whilst trying to escape with Rocky, puts that idea to rest.'There is nothing man cannot do once he accepts the fact there is no God,' says heavily armed Norman shortly before attempting to artificially inseminate Rocky using a turkey baster in a bid to replace once again, he hopes, his murdered child.His plans foiled by Alex, and disorientated by the alarms, Norman fires randomly all around him, blowing a hole poignantly in a photograph of his daughter's smiling face.I generally prefer independent horror films, often preferring them to bigger budgeted, more diluted mainstream offerings. This is hugely enjoyable, and very tense. There are no heroes, no-one without flaws, just wronged people. Someone online described 'Don't Breathe' as a heavily expanded variant of the Buffalo Bill segment of 'Silence of the Lambs (1991)', which is a pretty good synopsis. It is good to see this doing well in the commercial arena; I wish more managed to gain such attention.",9,1,4,24 September 2016
The Shape of Water," A terrific and typical del Torro fairytale
","Michael Shannon, who starred recently in the terrific 'Can't Come Out to Play (2013)' plays Richard Strickland, gammy-handed Colonel in charge of studying 'the asset', a lone fish-creature held in captivity by the US government. Sally Hawkins plays Elisa, a mute woman who, alongside Zelda (Octavia Spencer) works as a cleaner for the project. Her next door neighbour is Giles, struggling homosexual artist (Richard Jenkins, Chicory from 2015's 'Bone Tomahawk'). I mention his sexuality, because alongside Elisa and African-American Zelda, these people are somewhat outcast in Baltimore, 1962, where this film is set. All except Strickland, of course, who is fully accepted and acceptable, a respectable military man - cruel, arrogant and 'decent': apart from his injured hand, of course.Strickland was bitten by the humanoid amphibian creature known as 'the asset', in this acclaimed Guillermo del Toro directed (and co-written) partial reimagining of 'Creature from the Black Lagoon.' It is hugely cinematic, beautifully shot, exquisitely acted and in places, strangely moving in the way that monster/human love affairs have occasionally been over the decades. Unfortunately, the sentimentality goes overboard on a number of occasions and squashes the appeal of the fragile relationship between the unappreciated mute girl and the abused creature.Satisfyingly though, there is no doubt that the 'system', the 'establishment' is entirely corrupt and that the higher up the proverbial ladder, the more brazenly deceitful the officials have become. As in the best traditions of horror, the unsightly creature is the one we all route for, whilst those who have given themselves the responsibility of hierarchy are, to quote Doctor Who, decadent, degenerate and rotten to the core. And how do our heroes attempt to thwart the nastiness around them? They escape, they run away. Ah, would that we could all do that ...This is a terrific and typical del Torro fairytale, child-like and affecting, with only the occasional sex-scene or moment of graphic horror violence to make the children audience members wince. It's a long 'un at just over two hours, but such is the spectacle, it never outstays its welcome. Lovely.",8,3,6,4 July 2018
The Witch," Spoilers follow ...
","What is it that separates a good film from a bad one? Certainly not budget (or lack of), not even acting talent. Not necessarily a cohesive story. Generally speaking, it is down to individual taste. With horror, gore and special effects can be added to the list of things that don't really matter â€“ it is, I suppose, a translation of convincing mood, of atmosphere, of fear. I say all this because 'The Witch' has received widespread acclaim, yet is almost the polar opposite of successful horror films of modern times.This concentrates on the ascension (or descension?) of young Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) into a witch. Beginning with the exile of a family of six (Shortly â€“ if briefly to become seven) to a farm beside a secluded forest. The head of the family William (Ralph Ineson) does his best to provide for them, but lacks skill as a hunter and is surrounded by mysteriously failing crops. Whilst in the care of Thomasin, the new baby vanishes â€“ her older brother Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw) also disappears only to return in a state of possession, and the two remaining youngest, Jonas and Mercy, display increasingly frightening behaviour. It seems an unexplained and tragic series of coincidences mars Thomasin, but as things transpire, events seem pre-ordained by the legendary Black Philip.As a glut of unexplained circumstances occur that disposes of her family, Thomasin wanders in a trance, into the forest where she comes across a haven of naked witches who, after completing a ritual of dance movement around a blazing fire, physically rise and ascend into the trees. Laughing, Thomasin joins them.The acting in this is extraordinary throughout, even from the youngest members of William's family. Occasionally, the olde-world dialogue spoken with thick, regional accents, is hard to make out. And we only see a witch once in close-up. A seductive, long-haired woman emerges from a cottage deep in the forest and appears to seduce young Caleb (there is also an incident where her coven break into the barn when Thomasin has been imprisoned by her father, and drink the blood of the animals, but this is shrouded in darkness).It has been suggested by a handful of reviewers that this could be a kind of loose prequel to 'The Blair Witch Project (1999)', which, if you forget the change in location, is an interesting possibility â€“ if you want it to be. Any connection is, I think, entirely unintentional.This is a leisurely-paced, stunningly shot psychological horror in which a family's worst fears actually become a distinct possibility. It won't please everyone, although it did well commercially and received well deserved critical acclaim.",8,2,4,11 August 2016
The Silence of the Lambs," Spoilers follow ...
","It is difficult to convey what a massive film this was on its release. It transformed second-billed Anthony Hopkins from a highly respected and well-known actor into an international superstar, caused a degree of controversy and cemented Jodie Foster's reputation as a major talent. Both won awards for this, and the film won several others.It isn't difficult to see why. Starling's (Foster) initial meeting with Lector (Hopkins) has a tremendous build up – tales of Lector's legendary brutality, warnings and a corridor full of inmates leering (and worse) at Starling as she makes her way to his cell. The following scene alternately fills the screen with first Hopkins' face and then Foster', and – considering they are really explaining the plot to the audience - is electrifying.Starling's isolation in her male-dominated job is nicely conveyed visually (without over-labouring the point) often simply by featuring her in scenes with men a lot taller than her. Her willful lack of vulnerability ensures we are instantly on her side. When we meet Lector, such is his beguiling magnificence, we find ourselves on his side too. A dilemma for the audience, but a fascinating one.Among this terrific cast, it would be an error to overlook the contribution of Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill. His perversion is told to us at first, and revealed slowly thereafter, culminating in a scene in which he hides his penis between his legs and displays himself as a vision of what he believes to be divine beauty. Much of the original novel's detail regarding Bill has not been included in the film (how much more shocking – perhaps too shocking – it would have been to see him wearing one of his skinned female victim's breasts, as in Thomas Harris's story). And yet he still emerges as a deranged and frightening figure.The double twist towards the end of SPOILER (a) Lector's ingenious escape, and (b) the realisation that Starling's back-up team have gone to the wrong house leaving her to face Bill alone, are perfectly handled. And yet for such a controversial film, there is little gore actually in it – it is the implied violence and Lector's relish in it that shreds the nerves. 'Silence of the Lambs' is thoroughly deserving of its acclaim.",9,0,1,11 August 2016
