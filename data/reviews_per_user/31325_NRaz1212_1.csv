The Blair Witch Project," A thriller? PLEASE!
","Most thrilling movie of the year?!  PLEASE!  It was more like the funniest movie of the year.  Throughout the entire movie there were comedic moment and I can count maybe 3 things that were 'scary' in the movie.It could be my own fault as I was hoping so much I would go into the theatre and be scared out of my mind. No movie has ever done that to me and this movie failed as well.  I do however appreciate the basis of the movie.  The directors spent next to nothing filming it, no soundtrack..the way it was filmed was very clever as well.  But this movie just does not live up to its 'thriller' expectations.",4,0,2,1 August 1999
