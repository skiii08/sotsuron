Catch Me If You Can," Amazing Con Artitst
","This movie portrays life of Frank Abagnale Jr. who before his 19th birthday posed as a teacher, lawyer, doctor and airline pilot. He was one of the most daring con men, forgers, imposters, and escape artists in history. Throuout his teen years he had commit bank frauds and collected almost 2.5 million dollars. The character Frank Abagnale is played be Leonardi diCaprio who has done an excellent job playing Frank and also Carl Hanratty who is a FBI bank fraud agent played by Tom Hanks. Hanratty mission was to track down Abangnale with his team and during the movie Frank even encountered FBI agent face to face but he failed to recognize that it was him. FBI agents were no match for this great con artitst. This is another Steven Spielberg's great hit and the story line and screen play in this movie is really enjoyable.",10,2,3,8 April 2009
