The Expendables 2," no genre for old men
","The Expendables 2 is a big, brash, boring waste of time. It is unable to decide what it wants to be and ends up being nothing. It is extremely over the top in places and that should be accompanied by a sense of joyousness or fun. It is not. Its a collection of badly realised clich√©s, bad actors and desperate old men denying their age. Simon West has never been a very good director- he ruined the Tomb Raider movie and he is insipid here. Nothing about the Expendables Two is memorable or interesting. At times I was cringing with embarrassment at the 'jokes'. Apparently there is a possibility of a third movie.I hope it doesn't happen but if it is lets hope a few other 80s actors are reunited. Imagine the poster Stallone, Devito, Michael J Fox are the Dimunitives.Wait for this on DVD..picking it apart is probably fun if you're drunk with friends. There is no fun to be had paying to see this in cinemas.",3,24,73,17 August 2012
World War Z," unimpressive
","We all know about this film's troubled production history and movies with that kind of problematic shooting process always seem to turn out to be either stunning enough to silence the critics or as awful as everyone expected.sadly WWZ falls into the latter category. Its a mess. Marc Forster shouldn't be allowed to direct action movies. He can't construct those sequences at all well. The superfast cuts and hand held camera make it difficult to see what is going on. The script is a mess, and the fact that the last third of the flick was rewritten and reshot doesn't help.Brad Pitt is certainly not my idea of a learned man or an intellectual. He looks like a big issue seller.His family add nothing to the plot as Brad travels the world looking for clues to the zombie outbreak.The set up of the outbreak and the zombies themselves vary greatly from the ( far superior) book. The idea that the virus takes eleven seconds to turn you into as full blown zombie yet apparently the disease spread so fast because of air travel. With an incubation period that short they must be letting zombies go on holiday nowadays. So the script fails from the outset.Anyway Brad is sent on a high priority mission to find what caused the infestation. he is not the first choice and is subservient to a virologist. It is a sign of the laziness of the writing that the audience knows the other guy will die allowing Pitt to be the hero long before it happens. The lazy writers make no attempt to handle this subtly and the obstacle to Pitt's heroism simply falls over and shoots himself in the head. Brad Pitt doesn't understand the concept of focus unless the focus is on him. Several other unlikely and completely bloodless action sequences occur including Bradley cutting off an Israeli soldiers arm with one blow to stop the infection turning her into a zombie. No blood is seen during this and Pitt must be faster than the Man of Steel if the virus turns you into a zombie in eleven seconds. ( Incidentally the Israeli woman is super tough because as well as being bitten by a zombie and having her arm chopped off to save her she survives the blowing up of and crash landing of an aircraft). Brad throws a grenade on the plane kill a zombie- unless he really really doesn't want to go to Wales.For the so-called climax does indeed take place in Cardiff. After the original ending scenes of an epic battle in Russia were junked, the reshoot was set somewhere cheaperThe resolution of the movie would be the stupidest thing in cinemas this year if not for A Good day To Die hard.I'm sure some will say that you shouldn't analyse things too much but suspension of belief only goes so far. I don't see why IO should make excuses for a shameless cash grab like this.",3,6,12,1 July 2013
Ender's Game," worth seeing on the big screen
","Ender's Game is based on the first of a series of science fiction tales, and this movie serves as the introduction for what is presumably expected to be a series of films.The film inevitably misses a lot of the book - it could scarcely be expected to include everything- but the story is still told in an entertaining and understandable fashion.Asa Butterfield is outstanding as the title character. It is no mean feat for an actor of his age to carry a blockbuster film.The rest of the cast are very good. I didn't particularly warm to ben Kingsley's character but that was because of the writing rather than the acting.Visuals are excellent and I really enjoyed the score. Not sure I'd buy the DVD but if they ever make a sequel I'll watch it.",8,2,6,1 November 2013
The Bourne Legacy," possibly the best of the bourne movies
","The Bourne legacy introduces audiences to a new hero Aaron Cross, played by jeremy Renner from MI4. Cross is not simply a Bourne substitute but an intriguing character in his own right. Like Bourne we first see him floating apparently lifeless in a body of water, but as the film progresses we see Cross' story and personality diverge from Bourne's.Rachel Weisz ( still scrumptious at 40+) is the leading lady. Weisz's character is a Doctor and is ironically more like Marie (the female lead in Ludlum's novels) than the Marie who appeared on screen in The Bourne Identity.The beginning is a bit convoluted but it sets up the background that will hopefully be delivered in further sequels. Once the action starts it grips like a vice and the tension is aided by the fact that , unlike z-list garbage like the expendables 2, Cross' opponents are intelligent, capable and motivated. This creates a sense of threat and the audience can readily believe that the heroes might lose or be killed.The confrontation in Marta's house is worthy of Hitchcock. Further tension and excitement follows in a globe trotting adventure that climaxes with a breathtaking motorcycle chase that tore my nerves to shreds.Renner and Weisz are excellent in their roles. There is not one weak performance in the film. Do yourself a favour and see this on the big screen.",10,19,36,10 September 2012
