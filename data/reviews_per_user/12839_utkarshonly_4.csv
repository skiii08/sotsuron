Iron Man 3," Marvel, Why you no marvel?
","Iron Man 1 was awesome. Iron man 2 was also awesome. With Avengers, I died and went to heaven.Iron man 3 brought me back to Earth. :/I guess there was too much pressure on these guys. They put in everything into the movie. Not everything they had, I mean everything there is to Iron Man movie.Well, the result was disappointing.They should have focused on something.There was Tony trying to get away from the suit, there was tony saving Pepper and the world, there was Tony building rubbish to save Pepper and the World. I mean DUDE! You built the Iron Man Suit and now you are building guns that shock people? Then yes there is Tony being sarcastic and misanthropic. There is also Tony the good and caring friend. Yeah and of course, there Tony doing the 'right' thing at the end.I couldn't really understand how three helicopters can enter US airspace and fire missiles at Tony's house and yet remain untraceable. :|Prime Facie, it may be entertaining, but all in all, it was disappointing.",5,5,10,30 April 2013
The Adjustment Bureau," A very entertaining love story
","I love it! It was so much fun. One could maybe predict the end but it didn't really matter. The plot was very well scripted. The whole concept of a higher power as an organization without an end of the world stuff was awesome.Matt Damon and Emily Blunt look really good together. The romance isn't cheesy at all. It's nice and sweet. To top it all, Emily is humorous too.I have watched it more than once and I still don't mind sitting through it again. It is one of such movies which light and entertaining at the same time.Even without extraordinary acting or mind blowing CGI, this movie will keep you engrossed and leave you happy at the end.",7,1,1,25 April 2013
The Shawshank Redemption," 2549th Review
","Movies are meant to entertain. Most of the times, they even fail to do that. In this era, dominated by Computer Generated Imagery (CGI), most movies project an alternative reality, a getaway from our dry world. In such manner, it is fun to watch and even very entertaining.Only might bring up The Dark Knight, which is also a truly great movie, in such conversations but in the end it is futile.The Shawshank redemption is a class of movies, which until now has only got itself in it. This movies forces us to question ourselves. Through these movies, we live someone's else life and understand it.It is entertaining as hell not cause of the imagery or the camera work or the some cool gadgets rather cause it strips down the beautiful human nature and portrays the intricate feelings in a form so powerful that it may be more of a reality than this life is.Every time you watch this movie, you learn about yourself. You grow. You believe.With lots of awe admiration and respect, A Shawshank Redemption Fan",10,0,0,25 April 2013
The Croods," It was very funny!
","There are some scenes which I just can't get out of my head. Even thinking of them makes me burst out laughing. This has been happening so much that my family is wondering if there is something wrong with me.The animation is really nice. The story is unique and the movie is packed with humour. Along with the light hearted fun, lies a deeper meaning portrayed beautifully, The fear of change.Well, what can I say, I could watch this movie over and over. It is one of those classics I guess like ice age.It is even intellectually appealing.A short packet of fun. A must watch!",7,1,2,25 April 2013
