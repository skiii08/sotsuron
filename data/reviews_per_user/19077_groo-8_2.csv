Requiem for a Dream," My love for this movie will never die
","I didn't know anything about this movie before renting it at my local video store, spent a lot of time on sea. Few times in your life you witness a truly outstanding and unique thing, this for me was one of these moments. Could be cause this movie told the same story that happen't to a couple of my friends. Don't know were to start, All actors hands up a super duper job, Director Darren Aronofsky i got some good news and some bad, Good news one of the best movies ever, Bad news are that Darren will probably never do better than this, Orson Welles curses cause he did it at first try, Quentin Tarantino proved you can survive after a good debut and do even better and still stay alive. Parents do you really thing some documentary's the Government makes will keep your kids of drugs, this movie will. I recommend this movie to all gods creatures. Only a handful of movies can do this to me, this movie moved me, made me feel happy-sad is the only way to describe my feelings. My Score 10. Now all i have to do is travel this world to find a cinema so i can stop kicking myself for missing out of that unreal experience.",10,0,1,3 March 2005
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Freddy is coming 4U
","One of the best horror films i have ever seen. With some scary scenes, average gore factor but enough blood to satisfy any horror buff out there . One never knows what Wes Carven is gonna do, many of his films are disasters but he always seems to comeback from a disaster flick and makes a brilliant film. Everything in this movie screams instant cult classic and i guess it became one a soon as it was released. I spend a small fortune on it when i bought it from a local video-shop and back then movies were only rentals and not for sale in Iceland. I have seen this movie more than ten times and the most recent was about 2 months and it still holds it own. In a genre with so many dodgy bullets i treasure a hidden gem like this and like in many cases hoped that it would not turn in some endless sequels that actually just retold the story or bent the plot in ways one could not understand why. Does not matter about the other 10 movies or who knows how many were made they can't ruin this one.",8,0,0,7 April 2006
