Ghost," Lacks substance
","It would have made a good half-hour 'Twilight Zone' episode. Unfortunately, there just isn't enough story to last a full two hours; as a result the movie looks, and is, padded-out. Mediocre performances from Swayze and Moore overwhelm Goldberg's considerable contribution.If you want a good 'life-after-death' movie see Spielberg's Always (1989) which is far, FAR more restrained in it's handling of similar material.",3,4,13,16 October 1998
