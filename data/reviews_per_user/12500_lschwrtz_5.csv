The Ring," Wow, what a horrible disappointment.
","I know it's never fair when you don't see a big hit movie until a few weeks after release, and you hear so many great things about it.  It never lives up, and I usually have sympathy for a movie in this situation.But The Ring was a freaking trainwreck of a production, and I can't believe anyone liked it.  There were two good parts in the movie, and they were both beacuse of well done, creepy images.  The first was near the beginning when they found the older girl in the closet, and you see her face for about a quarter of a second.  That was creepy.  The second and final good part was when the girl was walking out of the TV.  Bravo for that scene.The rest of the movie was nothing more than terrible.  The acting...Oh my dear lord I can't even decide where to begin.  It was despicable.  And I am usually very forgiving of acting in either an action or a horror flick, because they usually have redeeming qualities.  But there was no excuse for acting THIS unimpressive.  I am talking here mainly about the two main characters.  They simply sucked.  I can't describe it any differently.Also, the script/writing.  What the #*&%^@(*&#%^()@# were these people thinking?  What unengaging, uninteresting dialogue!  Screw the writing of this bad, bad movie.I have seen worse movies, but I'm very vocal abou this one because it's probably the worst movie I've ever seen that was considered excellent by most people.  Maybe I'm just completely stupid.2.5/10  You're better off watching Eight Legged Freaks so you can at least get some laughs.  At least that movie didn't take itself SO seriously, like The Ring.Bah.  I can't say anymore.",3,1,3,29 October 2003
The Ring," People liked it, but I thought it sucked
","OK, this movie had potential. It was, as others have stated, well crafted - the direction, the premise, the imagery - all good.But I cannot tap into a movie very easily if it has either bad acting or bad dialogue, and this movie failed at both of those. I simply did not sympathise with the characters, and never did get the creepy/cool/scary/funny feeling I get from truly great thriller/horror flicks like The Exorcist, The Shining, Poltergeist and Psycho.It's funny, the supporting actors were not too bad, but I thought the two main roles were terrible. They needed either Jennifer Connely and Jared Leto, Christina Ricci and Johnny Depp, or hell even Julia Roberts and Kevin Bacon to do this movie.And it needed better dialogue.3/10 - wait for it, someday we will be granted a truly wonderful horror flick to put in our proud collection of horror DvDs, and finally be able to say that yes, our generation can produce good horror.A better remake in the meantime is the remake of Psycho. Vince Vaughn gives a great performance and it is most definitely worth your time.",3,0,1,13 February 2005
Training Day," Decent..sort of
","This movie was entertaining for the most part. My overall reaction was 'Cool. Good movie. Let's never think aboutit again.' Because this is the sort of movie that gets worse if you think aboutit too much.  It started to slowly get worse towards the end of themovie when I couldn't really help but think about the specifics ofwhat was going on. Denzel, yeah he acted well. He was believable. Hawk? He did a fine job, just barely good enough to cover up thefact that he was (let's face it) miscast. (And that is a complement tohim, I know I couldn't be miscast into this part and stil pull it off) But anyway, I get turned off by action flicks that try to be more thanaction flicks, and this movie kind of did that. Washington did NOT deserve an award for this. His character wasscripted in such a typical way that all he had to do was put on aconvincing face, hold his gun right and say his lines. Hawk had a MUCH more difficult character to play. There wasconfusion in him, weakness, guilt, value struggle...all that goodstuff. In short, this movie was good in some ways, not good in others. I don't regret having seen it...I would have regretted it if i paid to seeit in the theaters. 5/10",Null,0,11,11 July 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," I hate this movie
","I commented on the Italian Job, saying that many action flicks are ruined by the horrible dialogue/script/acting. (Italian job was an example of a movie where this did NOT happen. I liked it) Some action movie fans will criticize me on the grounds that one shouldn't be concerned with these things in an action flick, hence the genre title, 'Action Flick' But there is a huge difference between an action movie where the dialogue/script/all that stuff is bad but completely harmless to the action itself, and a movie where all that stuff draws way too much attention to itself.This movie was written and acted so badly that almost all of the action was destroyed. The exception is later in movie beginning with the arena scene. That was great.Anakin and that queen girl whatever her name is had NO, ABSOLUTELY NO CHEMISTRY. They were unbearable. The drama had no depth. I say get rid of it! And I'm sorry, Yoda is a Jedi master. I accept that he can kick ass. But physically??? I could not stand watching this limping, cane walking, 900 or so year old creature suddenly do backflips and acrobatics while wielding a light saber. Can anyone honestly say that this sat right with them?This among other things, that I would mention if I didn't have to leave this computer right now, amounted to a very bad movie.Thanks for listening.",Null,1,2,7 July 2003
The Italian Job," Entertaining!
","Well, I saw this movie with a basically neutral attitude going into it. I was pleasantly surprised...it had good action scenes, a GREAT cast, and a script/plot that did not suck so much that it diverted attention away from the action. (I'm a firm believer that the most common way an action movie shoots itself in the foot is by having a script that is bad AND that directs too much attention.) This movie wasn't Shakespeare but it got the job done.Seth Green is hilarious, he speaks to my generation like few others can. (Yes, I'm one of those 'idiots' who liked Idle Hands. Shoot me.)My one complaint about this movie is Jason Statham, or whatever his name is. He's cocky with an annoying accent, and he's unnecessarily condescending. This would not bother me if the characters to whom he was condescending were supposed to be disliked by the audience.  But the Italian Job is full of character's that I personally liked (Norton is a God and I love him. He was able to play the villain and still retain his charisthsthmthsma..(spelling uncertain)) Yeah, he can to stunts, yeah, he can drive. He's a good action actor with good potential, and I hope that he develops a sense of humility.If he does, he can be a great movie star.Anyway, yes, go everyone! Go action movie remakes! Go entertainment! Go Seth Green! Statham take a running jump. 7/10",Null,1,2,2 July 2003
