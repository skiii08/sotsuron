Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," When I was a kid...
","The Phantom Menace (I think the name was an inside joke: The Fandom Menace) I find to have the same qualities as the first three.  The movie sets standards for visual effects.  The characters are archetypical, and there is not much to them.  Now let's get down to specifics.In my opinion, Jar Jar helped the movie and can expect to get a good cult following along the lines of Chewy and Boba Fett, But this will take a little while.  I thought that his clumsiness could have been more volatile. It only really seemed contained to him.Darth Maul did deserve more.  If it was my movie to make, we would have seen more of the guy, but he would not have said a word beyond his original 4 lines.  I would have had Kenobi get him in the second movie.  But hey, who knows what tricks Darth Sidious has up his sleeve.I thought that giving the force a little scientific background was risky. However, they only show that there is a science of getting jedi powers. The force is still the force and mystical as ever.This is the first movie where I found myself wishing that there were more subtitles.The best part of the movie was the casting of Ewan as Obi-Wan.The light saber duels make Luke look like the amateur that he is.The similarities of the male Skywalkers are nice.(wineing to your droid)During the couse of the movie, I forgot that Portman was in 'The Professional,' Neesen was in 'Schindler's List,' MacGregor was in 'Trainspotting' and 'Brassed Off,' and that the Captian was the African from 'Highlander.'  This in my book is good acting as far as action movies go.One thing I noticed is that it is an inverse to Episode4.  The conflict is political rather than strictly military.  Everyone is very aware of the Jedi.  The bad guys are in hiding.I like how Jake played Anikin mainly because you get the feeling that he might not be the right man for the job of fixing the universe.The other actors I think excelled considering that this film has to fit with the others as part of a whole.Two additional things missing were a funky alien tune(yeah empire did not have one, I know) and the Imperial Death March.  This last puzzled me untill I made the realization that there was no empire to march to the march.All in all I thought it set out to do what is was supposed to do, and was consistant with the other three movies.  We have to remember that it was before the dark times, before the empire. In my book it lands somewhere between Empire and Jedi.  It was good.  I think the reason that so many were disappointed was because they remember Star Wars from their childhood.  So they remember it better than it really was. Thus, when presented with different characters, it seems drab or out of place to them.  We must keep in mind that Star Wars is an action movie.  It is not a film.  There is a big difference.  Acting, plot and script are secondary to the story and presentation.  After the third episode is complete, I believe that most will feel for these new characters as much as we do for the original ones.",7,0,0,4 June 1999
Sleepy Hollow," Excellent film except for 2 elements. Spoiler if you think.
","The cinematography was good.  The acting, by all persons, Depp, Walkin, Ricci, and Lee, was great.  Costumes were good.  And the background was close enough to the real story that you felt you were not watching a rewrite.  However there were anachronisms galore and I felt that the movie we were set up for was not the movie we got at the end.
First are the anachronisms.  The way the women dressed was a little bit off. Ichabod looked more 19th century than 18th.  So did the courtroom.  The forensic Pathology that Ichabod practiced may have been a slight bit early, but that is debateable.Now the set up.  We are given a character that is ahead of his time.  He uses reason, and science to figure out crimes.  Crane is presented as a Sherlock Holmes type.  The first quarter of the movie is presented in a sort of 'Hound of the Baskervilles' style.  This is where I was expecting it to lead.  Halfway through this idea falls apart and we find ourselves in a witchcraft based fantasy.  That was a turn that in my opinion hurts the movie more than it helps.  It would have made more sense to give Ichabod a background more like that of Van Helsing in Stoker's Dracula.  Or made him the cop that blames things on the paranormal a la Fox Moulder.  Then the investigative aspect of him would still be intact and the viewer would not feel that his time was wasted in needless character development.  Then again, that would make the character all the more futile.  And when reason confronts folklore and the arcane, then futility is the result.  This would make the movie more unreasonable and thus spookier.  For things without reason baffle the modern human mind.All in all it is a good film.  However the characterisation methods are a bit untried but still work well to acheive the directors goal.  If you can stomach a historical to fantasy switch and an age of reason to magical plot, then you will enjoy this flick.",Null,0,0,30 November 1999
