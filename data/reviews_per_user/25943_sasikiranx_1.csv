Hereditary," an intense modern day horror classic
","The forte of this movie is that it is unrelenting till the end. it is not a typical horror movie as, it doesn't rely on jump scares and loud bgm at all . the film has a strong script and some great performances by the actors. The story, in a nutshell, falls in the lines of rosemary's baby.The movie is a slow burner suspense drama with some intensely disturbing scenes interspersed.
Not one frame in the movie appears fake or cheesy.there is sufficient character development for the audiences to empathize with the characters. as a result the movie delivers a truly immersive emotional ride to the audience...a must watch for the horror film fans",9,23,46,29 August 2018
