Skyfall," Use A Mac! :)
","Spoiler Checked for Safety... :)The Bond Franchise is reminding just how old I am. To counter, this film also is fresh and reminds me to be so myself, despite that we're both 50 this year.It's a pity at a runt is replacing him in the IMAX at the formerly Sony Metreon because the cinematography is wonderful (and apparently specially made for IMAX). Gosh, when did Shanghai get so lit up?It's wonderful to see so many references and just plain symbols in a film. Old friends brought back, although they would be spoilers on how. The Golden Globes should have given a bunch more nods to this film than the one they did (which if they'll do on sales, they will win).Issues: Sony tried to hard to showcase their electronics in this film. Compare it to the first Bayformers where they use Panasonic SD Cards and reduced sized PCMCIA devices to move their data around instead of a hard drive, broken out of a shattered plastic Windows system. That won't work with a sculpted Aluminum or Polycarbonate Mac laptop (although removing the HD from MacBooks only requires removing the battery, three screws, and a plate).It's a pity this is Dame Judi Dench's last appearance as M. IMHO, it is her best, but at 77 to do this much physical work was a challenge. 'Licensed to Thrill', a Bond Motion Simulator ride, probably gave her the second most amount of screen time, although I haven't seen it at California's Great America in years.I found it very odd last Thursday to see this film. I thoroughly enjoyed it. By last evening, I understood why, but the reasons 'I can neither confirm nor deny.'Disclosures: Our family fortune is WAY over-weighted on Apple, Inc., but it starts from my being a long time fan. My screen saver is another Aston Martin because I have a family - The Rapide. Photos by Me.",9,3,8,15 December 2012
A Star Is Born," A Star is BORN (Even When She Drops an F-Bomb)
","Thinking of my youngest daughter who may be listed on this website someday along side <a href='/name/nm7626019/'>Domee Shi</a>, who healthy pooped just after being born untimely ripped from her mother's womb <a href='/title/tt2884018/'>Macbeth (2015)</a> (not that bad, but was emergency because her head got stuck).Ally works as a server, who has gone from a drag bar to a high class restaurant (and may others), although we see the madhouse that's the kitchen and demanding bosses. She's really a singer and songwriter, singing an introductory part of Over the Rainbow I'd forgotten about (and bought sheet music last week with that part). Jackson Maine is a boozed up rock/country star who flies in private jets (although they could be NetJets). After a concert, he randomly finds that drag bar, where Ally sings because they love her voice, performing the classic 'La Vie En Rose', choosing to focus on him in her performance.Just like <a href='/title/tt0104694/'>A League of Their Own (1992)</a> wonderfully shows the behind the scenes of baseball, <a href='/title/tt1517451/'>A Star Is Born (2018)</a> shows the behind the scenes of musical performance and stardom, including getting your picture taken when you hit a supermarket. The music is awesome. (my family may get tired of hearing the soundtrack album in the car, but, oh, well. Got the songbook when I got the fuller edition of Over the Rainbow.)The direction is Oscar worthy. Just before the full frontal nude scene, <a href='/name/nm0177896/'>Bradley Cooper</a> tells <a href='/name/nm3078932/'>Lady Gaga</a> she's ugly while she's taking a bath. She becomes enraged with him and throws him out while standing up. He walks away with a 'We Nailed This!' smile on his face with her out of focus. I'm surprised a bottle of bubble bath didn't pursue him.A comment on one of the goofs: <a href='/name/nm0177896/'>Bradley Cooper</a>'s dog would have freaked out more than the stunt dog in <a href='/title/tt1753383/'>A Dog's Purpose (2017)</a>. A well written scene with his dog acting as sad as H.W.'s.It's wonderful for a movie to end with I'll Never Love Again which reminds me how shocked I am to be with my wife for coming up on 28 years with how our first date went. She (a violist) wants a memorial concert but the Shrine Auditorium might be much. (although with her musical friends, I may need a fair sized venue. And I'm playing Misty <a href='/title/tt0067588/'>Play Misty for Me (1971)</a> on my clarinet.)",10,0,3,20 January 2019
The Adventures of Tintin," TinTin comes to the Big Screen
","My younger daughter is really the TinTin fan, but I'm not sure I could have gotten her to write this review. (it's hard enough to get her to do her homework.)The modern version of Rotoscoping is done well enough where on occasion I could suspend noticing it was animation and not live action. In fact, this movie could have been done live action save for the search for an actor to play TinTin.The movie does earn it's rating. Someone early in the film is shot dead in a hail of gunfire, but the impacts are shielded from the viewer and TinTin by the front door of his apartment building. My daughter wanted to duck out before this scene because she is enough of the TinTin fan to recognize the level of gunfire and the results in his stories.Daniel Craig, who we're now conditioned to seeing as a hero (Cowboys and Aliens, Mr. Bond), is the villain here. In a complement on voice acting, to me he does not sound like James.It may have been the theater, but for a children's series it was dead quiet at the beginning and quiet (almost except for my daughter, who tends to make a running commentary). When the lights went up, I found out that most the audience was adults, especially groups of adults. One group included an elderly lady with a French accent to whom I commented that she probably read the stories in French and not the ugly English translation.The film works well enough to earn an eight in my book.",8,0,2,21 January 2012
Wreck-It Ralph," Wonderful Movie for PG Family Members
","I'll start this review with this: Know your young children before you see this movie. Gunfire, alcohol references, and beating on objects. I don't want the 'Cars 2' reaction.Wreck-It Ralph is villain to hero movie, a division of Fish Out of Water. A Ludicrous number of game and movie references fill this movie, but understanding them wasn't necessary for my twelve year old daughter.The arc of this story is a good reminder that every hero needs a great villain to bounce against. The movie has happy, funny, sad, and scary moments, put together like they should be. (I think they read 'Save the Cat', a great book on screen writing.)For the bizarre, Gameinformer, Game Stop's house gaming magazine, recommends this movie for the respect it gives to gaming characters.I'm not sure about the music. A piece like Shrek's 'Hallelujah' would have been nice, but the piece was OK.I'm hopeful that Disney will convert the DCA Video Arcade *back* into the retro place they had for TRON. They now know what to put in there, including Rampage.",9,4,5,2 November 2012
Cars 2," Spy Thriller in the Cars Universe
","Take the Cars characters, place them in 'Wacky Races'-style races, mix in a healthy dose of Bond (including physically impossible gear), shake (don't stir) and you get Cars 2. Finn McMissile is Bond and Sir Miles Axlerod is Dominic Greene. A character who has already given surprises us shows them in spades in a fun globe-trotting adventure.The Michael Giacchino soundtrack, just like his work for The Incredibles, invokes a number of spy themes. 'Collision of Worlds' by Robbie Williams & Brad Paisley hits the combining of Cars and Bond.Cats and Dogs 2 has numerous Bond references - this film has an absolute ridiculous number of them, starting from the Aston Martin DB5, Bond's iconic vehicle (FYI, they're listed in the credits). For a Bond fan like me, they're fun, but the family-film only people will be confused and angry (unless they watch the Spy-oriented family films like Spy Kids).Lightning McQueen grew up in the first film - this time it's Mater's turn.His country hick persona and inability to keep a secret hide his strengths. How everyone grows I'll leave for you to discover (and some folks seem like they didn't). A hint: Think Columbo and Matlock.Lots of guns, explosions, and numerous understood deaths of vehicles. (Don't the 80''s Transformers do this?) Fortunately, nothing as cold as Bond killing a henchman. Also, aren't kids often playing with cars hitting each other and shooting?Including the closing credits, this film borrows from numerous films in an interesting concoction (shaken, not stirred) worthy of the professional critic rating it has been getting. My daughter is awaiting its arrival on DVD/Blu-Ray/Digital Copy to see it again and again. Myself, I'll be getting the soundtrack once I put enough in iTunes cards together...Disclosures: I own Disney stock which was originally Pixar stock. A relative of mine, Michael Fong (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0284591/), works at Pixar. Finally, my screen-saver is a collection of photographs of Aston Martin Rapides I took at a special showing at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco in 2009 and the 2010 San Francisco Auto Show.",8,0,1,4 July 2011
