The Ring," Disappointing...
","Contained none of the suspense of the original. The film was too slick, not enough silent moments to create tension.  Everything(well some things) are explained too much - I do not want to feel as if I'm thick while watching a film. Naomi Watts was the best thing about the film. Not looking forward to seeing the remake of Ring 2",4,0,0,1 November 2002
