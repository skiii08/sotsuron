Sucker Punch," What a waste of money
","I am honestly the kind of person who usually like this kind of movie. I got blown away by any terrific visual movie and CG movie and Zack Snyder has always exceeded my expectations. Therefore I was expecting a LOT from this movie, specially when I saw the first trailers. I knew the story, I knew It could be kinda crazy and couldn't make any sense at all, but if I'd bet 1 million dollars that this movie would surprise me I'd surely lose. This is by far one of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen. I was praying for the movie to end or join the people that was leaving the theater. Why didn't I? Because I was still hoping until the very last second of the movie for something to happen that could make any sense to that junk. Things that I completely disliked: The action is so boring that made me wanna cry, the acting is completely expendable, the lines, oh boy, how come you made Scott Glenn talk some rubbish like that? And the STORY, obvious. At the end I wanted to join Baby Doll in a lobotomy just to forget about this movie. The only two things not expendable are: the visuals and the girls and this is why I gave any points to this movie. I only regret they were not used in a proper outstanding project. It made me wonder why the studios have been canceling so many great projects out there and spending a huge amount of money in a project like this. Zack, excuse my honesty, but you clearly lost it and I hope and pray for you to succeed back with Superman.",3,5,13,21 June 2011
