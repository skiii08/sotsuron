The Blair Witch Project," This is probably the most we can expect from the horror industry for now.
","I was fortunate enough to obtain an underground copy of this movie through a friend of mine. Compared to the sort of horror movies that are routinely produced, it stands out as truly well conceived and assembled. The concept, the acting, the cinematography, and virtually all other elements are dead-on. Unfortunately, they went so far with it and did such a fantastic job that the few weak spots seemed very noticeable to me. For example, the movie is comprised of patched together footage from the cameras 'found later' - and almost all of this footage feels authentic. There are a few shots, though, which seemed as if no one would have been available to hold the camera, and I found that distracting. Also, like so many American swine, I am jaded to the extent that purely suggested horror seems a bit weak to me (though everyone I've shown the movie to has been terrified, so maybe it's just me). People have been saying that this film will change the horror industry, but beyond the predictable knock-offs, I don't see that 'method film-making' is likely to have much impact in the long run. I still look forward to seeing this movie on the big screen, partly just because I want to watch the audience's reactions.",10,1,2,23 July 1999
