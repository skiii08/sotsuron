Lucky Number Slevin," From curiously amusing to downright brilliant, this movie has it all
","Lucky Number Slevin starts off a bit slow, jumping from one scene to another in a seemingly incoherent fashion. It soon picks up the pace as Hartnett keeps scenes lively and fun, while the story is being unfolded layer by layer. Very quickly from then on, the movie keeps you wondering and guessing as to what's really going on, constantly progressing without giving too much away Â— until the very end of course, when it resolves in ways even the most keen observers wouldn't have predicted.Slevin is a well-balanced cocktail of humor, plot, twists and intriguing storytelling, and any fan of mystery-style movies would do well to check it out.",9,0,2,6 September 2006
