Iron Man 3," Spits In The Faces Of Fans
","Let Me Start By Saying That I Am A Huge Marvel Geek. I loved all of Marvel Studios previous movies (even Iron Man 2). These were entertaining movies that used the source material very well and adapted it to the big screen. I thought Marvel Studios couldn't go wrong ! Then I saw Iron Man 3.From The Start Iron Man 3 felt off. The tone, the music, and the characters didn't feel like they fit into the Marvel Cinematic Universe very well. The only thing that was working for me in this movie was The Mandarin, sure he didn't have 10 magic rings, but he acted like the comic character, and had me semi-engaged in the movie. Ben Kingsley did a fantastic job as the Mandarin ! Then as you've probably heard, they messed up the character sooo badly. They say that the Mandrain is a rasicst character then they go and make him a rasict British sterotype ? How is that any better, come on ! How over-protective are people today when the Mandarian is considered a racist character ?! How any comic fan approved of what they did is beyond me.But even without the Mandrain crap, this movie is still horrible. The Actors must of lost it or something because none of them (with the exception of Ben Kingsley) did a very good job in this. They all seemed off and half-assed portrayals of the character we love. Even RDJ wasn't very good this time around !The plot was also horrible. At no point did I have any interest in Extremes or Killian's character. The weird Radioactive Men Things were just boring and stupid villains that I had no interest in. the plot also contains 8-year old sidekicks, Pepper Potts as a fire monster, Iron Man magically being able to fix his heart just because he can. Come On Marvel, You Can Do Better than this.",1,14,30,20 August 2013
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Great Movie ! A WORTHY adaptation of Earth's Mightiest Heroes
","Wow. Just Wow. Marvel actually did, they made a movie that may have topped all of their other movies. (Cap 2 is the only real competition). So, Avengers: Age Of Ultron begins with a bang, literally, the first ten minutes are this massive Avengers Vs. Hyrda action sequence that is out of this world. Here we see Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, The Hulk, Black Widow, and Hawkeye re-assemble for one of the most exiting, squeal worthy movie scenes ever. This scene also introduces us to two new characters, Quicksilver (who Movie Buffs already know from 'X-Men: Days Of Future Past') and his twin sister, The Scarlet Witch. At first I was sceptical about these two, however as the movie progressed they slowly became some of my favourite 'Avengers' characters. Another thing that I found cool about these two is that their powers are quite different and something that separates them and this movie from the Original Avengers. Making for some awesome visual effects.As usual with these movies, the actors completely nail their roles. Even after all these years Robert Downey Jr. just IS Tony Stark, he once again owns the role and completely redeems the character after the horror that was 'Iron Man 3'. Chris Evans once again completely owns the role of Captain America, perfectly portraying both his old-fashion ideals and his completely bad-ass side perfectly. The other stand-out of the movie, one whom I did not expect, was Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye. That's right, Hawkeye, who was formerly Marvel's worst adaptation of a comic character after the Mandarin, is now awesome. He finally gets a back-story and motivation for his character and just kills it. Also, Hawkeye, much like his comic book-counter part, gets the funniest lines in the movie. ('I could do it, No one would know'). I could right about how every actor is perfect forever, but it would take me too long, these 3 (and another who I will get to later) are the stand-outs of the film, however the others all portray their characters to perfection as well (especially Chirs Hemsworth, Elizabeth Olsen, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson).Now the biggest change from the comics is for sure the personality of Ultron, it is to be expected seeing as in the movie Ultron's personality was based off of Tony Stark instead of Hank Pym. I however came to accept this version of Ultron. James Spader was just born to play (voice) this role. I felt for Ultron and understood his motivations and why he wanted to do what he did. I even felt sympathy for his character in certain parts of this movie. He see's humanity through a fresh, un-biased set of eyes and doesn't agree with modern-civilization. I will say that Ultron may have had one to many joke-lines, but I can cope with it. Now Thor, Ultron, Hawkeye and The Scarlet Witch are all great but my favourite character in the movie was by far The Vision, played by Paul Bettany. I don't want to give to much away about this character, but he is just brilliant and I can't wait to see more of him.The only reason I gave the movie 9 instead of 10 (It would be like a 9.5 if I had that option) was because it did feel a little rushed. I feel sorry for the non-Marvel fans going into the theatre as they may have trouble understanding what's going on. I've heard that the original cut was about 3 and half hours and you really can tell that they cut things out, that being said I've also heard that an extended edition will be released, and I think that version of the movie may become my favourite movie of all time.Overall, Avengers: Age Of Ultron is just about as good as a superhero movie can get it makes you laugh, cry, squeal in nerd-glee, and then at the end leaves you dying for more. Oh and since the line got cut in the movie.....AVENGERS ASSEMBLE !",10,18,38,29 April 2015
