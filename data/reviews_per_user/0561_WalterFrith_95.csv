Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Glad to see the split.
","When I first heard that this film was going to be split into two movies instead of being presented as one as originally planned, I was angry. I accused the powers that be of trying to squeeze two box office triumphs out of a single project. But after having seen both 'Kill Bill' and 'Kill Bill Vol.2', I am glad because both films are extremely different even though the stories are tied together with primarily the same actors and having the same director. Containing less action than 'Kill Bill', volume 2 is intelligent, bizarre and extremely engrossing. It absorbs all of its elements equally and David Carradine's performance as Bill is the best thing to happen in movie villain history since, well, I'll leave that up to individual interpretation.",Null,139,200,20 January 2005
Walk the Line," Johnny Cash comes to authentic life.
","Musical biographies of the past 30 years have been absorbing. 'The Buddy Holly Story', 'The Rose', 'The Doors' and 'Ray' have all been successful and following in a similar path is this film with a simple story telling technique, stellar performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon as Johnny Cash and June Carter. 'Walk the Line' is not afraid to show the flaws in the greatest country/crossover performer who ever lived because Phoenix is allowed to balance the performer and the man equally in a way that seems memorable on both ends and the chemistry between the two leads in magical in the traditions of old fashioned story telling.",Null,0,0,16 July 2006
Alien 3," Bad taste in the mouth
","While it is normal to often have a happy story go bad, somehow it just seems out of place here in a way you can't explain in words. Some of the happiness achieved at the end of 'Aliens' is taken away in this third film and it takes forever to get going once the new situation is established. There is minimal action and while the first 'Alien' movie was low on action and made up for it by being and high on tension, this film is just stale. Sigourney Weaver does her best this time around and she is quite good but David Fincher, who did well after this with 'Se7en', 'The Game', and 'Fight Club', seems like the wrong guy to direct a movie like this as his vision is full of potential but low on actual execution as he looks confused at times in the story he is trying to complete. Do yourself a favour and take this one with a grain of salt and put up a road block in lumping it in with 1 & 2, and avoid the fourth film at all costs.",Null,523,580,22 January 2005
Ali," Biggest letdown in many years!
","To begin on a positive note, Will Smith is excellent (but not Oscar worthy) as the world's most written about athlete of the 20th century, heavyweight boxer Muhammad Ali.  At every turn, Smith has his voice, mannerisms and ring steps in check.  But this film is incredibly benign and shallow.  Why is everyone making such a big deal about Jamie Foxx and especially Jon Voight as Howard Cosell?  Both of these characters are under written and underplayed.  There is such great detail in Ali's life that virtually nothing is covered here.  The film only details 1964-74 and tells us nothing about Ali's childhood and youthful rise as Cassius Clay and doesn't dive into his post boxing days when he learned he had Parkinson's disease.  Also, the film has a scene near the beginning where Ali is jogging and they say on the screen that it is February 1964 and from there there is nothing on screen to guide us through the rest of the film to tell us when the film is taking place. As the film fades out, there is only about a five line explanation about the women in Ali's life and how he regained the title back for a third time. 
All throughout this film, the boxing scenes are incredibly scattershot and this film has no adrenaline to give it the high charge and punch it needs and Stephen J. Rivele and Christopher Wilkinson who teamed up with Oliver Stone and wrote 1995's 'Nixon', did a very detailed job and along with director Michael Mann and Eric Roth, the four of them wrote 'Ali'.  Mann and Roth wrote the incredibly complex 'The Insider' in 1999 and did a great job and Roth has an Oscar for writing 'Forrest Gump'.  This is the best they can do with 'Ali'?Too many night club scenes, too much time spent on the religious aspects of Ali's life and too much emphasis on the wandering socializing outside the ring bring 'Ali' into a place in history where I predict this film will not receive a single Oscar nomination.  Not one!  What a waste considering its subject matter and complex man.  It has to be seen to be believed.  For future generations, this is not the place to learn about Ali's life.  Get your info off the net, like the writers of this film should have.  You'll be better informed!",Null,1,1,29 December 2001
Catch Me If You Can," Original and outstanding!
","Steven Spielberg has a knack for taking stories and making them look like nothing Hollywood has ever produced before.  While stories of con men are plentiful, this film is absorbing, convincing, light and touching.  It is a perfect holiday film as many of the scenes rotate on various Christmas Eves throughout the 1960's.  I suspect that Spielberg drew on the divorce of his own parents when he was young and translated some of that experience in this film, based on a true story, which leads the protagonist (DiCaprio) into a life of clever but ultimately harmless crime and who turns out to ultimately have a successful life.  Leonardo DiCaprio is back with a performance that tops his turn in 'Titanic' and he could land an Oscar nomination.  In a low key supporting role, Tom Hanks, an 'A' list actor without an ego and one of the most down to earth guys in the world, let alone Hollywood, takes second billing and runs with his part and knows the limits of it and never tries to make the film his own.  Christopher Walken will be under rated by most for his performance as DiCaprio's dad and I hope he finds his first Oscar nomination in twenty four years since 1978's 'The Deer Hunter'.  It will be a long time coming for a guy that Hollywood never really appreciated throughout the 1980's and 90's but who can act with the best of them.",Null,0,0,27 December 2002
The Ring," The paranormal variable !
","Technology. Looking at a videotape can kill you in this movie. Are there really curses in the world? Well, look at King Tut's tomb, the Boston Red Sox, the Chicago Cubs and my experience with the lottery. After a little light humour, getting serious is what this movie is all about. The performances are good, the technology is excellent and the story has twists that are hard to resist. It's evenly paced and has no slow spots. I like the fact that a sequel is being planned and given all of the sequels that we get that are based solely on making money, this seems to be the kind of story that can work with multiple stories done the right way. Perhaps the killing influence in the next film will be a DVD? :-)",Null,0,1,26 February 2005
Minority Report," The unique Spielberg look.
","Stories by writer Philip K. Dick have been made into some interesting movies such as 'Blade Runner' and 'Total Recall'.  His vision, as realized by Steven Spielberg in his own unique way, does not disappoint with 'Minority Report'.  In the year 2054, a Washington D.C. cop (Cruise) is a member of a unit that can see murders before they happen.  They arrest the people who will commit these crimes before they happen and a whole paradox of legal ramifications are to be found.  How do you prosecute someone for a crime they haven't committed after you've prevented it from happening?  That is the question.  This film shows that the technology to predict the future comes about by accident like most of history's great inventions.  There is sentiment thrown into this blistering sci-fi adventure as Cruise languishes over the death of a child and the break-up of his marriage.  There are several twists and turns and while lengthy, 'Minority Report' is NOT too long.  It's necessary to make the film as long as the complexities it explores and that is no easy task!",Null,0,0,6 July 2002
Finding Neverland," Depp delivers.....again
","Johnny Depp is finally starting to get the recognition he has long deserved. After his film debut in 1984's 'A Nightmare on Elm Street', Depp worked 19 years to get his first Oscar nomination for 'Pirates of the Caribbean' in 2003. His other roles in 'Benny and Joon' 'Ed Wood' and 'Donnie Brasco' are all Oscar worthy but he was never recognized. In 'Finding Neverland', Depp plays J.M. Barrie, creator of the Peter Pan legend. The film innocently tells of the inspiration for his literary creation of miracle and wonder. Kate Winslet plays the mother in a family of boys from whom Barrie draws his inspiration after courting her and becoming a father figure to the young men. Julie Christie plays the boys' grandmother who disapproves of Barrie's relationship with the boys. This film is told with Victorian style and a tender pace of emotional tranquility.",Null,2,2,22 January 2005
Training Day," Hard core nightmare for trainees.....
","It's a well known fact that the city of Los Angeles is going through its biggest corruption investigation in decades.  With 1997's 'L.A. Confidential' set in the early 50's and now 'Training Day' set half a century later in the early 21st century, we can see that people haven't changed one bit in all that time and have always been the same.  While the majority of police officers are honest and law abiding, 'Training Day' shows how one cop can do so much damage and that the crooked cop is worse than any criminal.  'Training Day' is designed to keep your stomach in knots from start to finish and features an Oscar calibre performance from Denzel Washington.  Ethan Hawke is the subject of Washington's training.  A veteran of the force, Washington takes Hawke in, trains him in the narcotics division of the LAPD and tries to justify criminal activity on the part of the police as a necessary part of nailing the bad guys and the film illustrates how corruption goes all the way to the top of the city's law enforcement officials.  'Training Day' has an exceptional look at street life with outstanding cinematography and editing and director Antoine Fuqua has crafted a film with exactly the right touch of violence and street smarts to match its intelligence and realistic look.  A brutally honest effort.",Null,1,11,7 October 2001
Meet the Parents," A great believable comedy!
",Ben Stiller really surprised me as he was able to hold his own quite well with Robert De Niro.  This believable and well relating comedy of real life moves well and as a date movie people can laugh at the inevitable.  Ben Stiller's personality in this movie is a lot like his character in 'There's Something About Mary'.  A nervous little guy with a streak of bad luck at almost every turn.  De Niro is grand as a seasoned veteran of the CIA and De Niro leads a cast in his usual towering fashion.  A nice movie with quirky jokes and some interesting slapstick.  It may also make lonely people feel happy that they don't have to deal with big families.,Null,0,0,10 October 2000
Unbreakable," On the right track!
","M. Night Shyamalan created such a stir with the surprise ending of 'The Sixth Sense' that 'Unbreakable' seems like a difficult encore to execute properly.  But Shyamalan does it beautifully.  By building a slow burn leading up to his latest revelation, Shyamalan doesn't TRY to top 'The Sixth Sense' and that's what makes 'Unbreakable' quite good.  Samuel L. Jackson is the MVP here, a cross between eccentricity and chilling horror.  Bruce Willis is good as the average blue collar man like he's done so well before. The movie is like a slow funhouse/horror house tunnel.  The slow pace works because there is so much to fill your mind with as everything becomes clearer and clearer like a jigsaw puzzle being filled in by a pro. 'Unbreakable' is one for the cult/buried treasure files as it will be appreciated more and more as the years pass.",Null,0,0,7 March 2001
Citizen Kane," The ground breaker for all time.....
","Upon seeing 'Citizen Kane' for the first time, the film can fool you.  It looks ordinary...like anyone can do it.  But upon multiple viewings and further examination, you come to realize that as a film of both academic and technical marvels, it set the standards for all films to come.  The special lenses built, the honest and hard boiled writing, the straight arrow direction and the personality of three dimensional acting by all the people in it are truly ground breaking.  Watch this film with an understanding that although finance and politics seem to rule our world, what's inside each human heart is unknown except to those who have one, and that's all of us, isn't it?",10,0,1,27 September 2003
Monster," Chills to the max!
","Charlize Theron gives one of the most brilliant performances of a lifetime. So brilliant in fact that if she continues to be a successful actress by choosing the right roles then she will never top this.  This is her masterpiece.Based on a true story, Aileen Wuornos is a woman who was executed in Florida in 2002 for murdering several men while she worked as a prostitute. Wuornos had real problems in life.  Abused as a child, discarded by her siblings and friends and other family as well as never finding success in life drove her insane enough to become a serial killer.The first time she kills someone in the film is when she is raped by her john.  She is bound and gagged but breaks free and then kills the man by shooting him.  After the initial shock passes, she finds killing easier and easier.  Befriended by  a young lesbian (Christina Ricci), she drags the young girl into this life with her.  Ricci's character never kills anyone but she knows what Wuornos is up to and is either too scared to report her or too sympathetic towards Wuornos' mixed up and miserable life.Theron's performance is so authentic and so good that it is just chilling. I left the theatre shaken up and that hasn't happened to me in a very long time.  Dare I say it is up there with the great female performances of the last 15 years alongside Jodie Foster in 'The Silence of the Lambs', Frances McDormand in 'Fargo' and Hilary Swank in 'Boys Don't Cry'.  Director Patty Jenkins deserves a ton of credit for telling a straight forward story that is neither sympathetic or false.  It is convincing on every level and will leave your jaw dropping to the floor after you see it.",Null,0,0,27 February 2004
Memento," Dreamlike memories
","What a superb film.  It's nice to see all the guys from 1997's 'L.A. Confidential' go on to have their own film masterpieces three years in a row.  First Kevin Spacey with 'American Beauty' in 1999, Russell Crowe in 'Gladiator' in 2000 and now Guy Pearce in 'Memento' in 2001.  It's almost impossible to describe this film without giving away the end but its dreamlike power reeled me in and gave me chilling reminders of Coppola's 1974 classic 'The Conversation' in the way some of the macabre elements played out quickly, sharply and figuratively.  Pearce is totally convincing in his role and Joe Pantoliano plays his part with his usual character actor ambiance intact.  With short scenes, pieced together like a jigsaw puzzle, and not revealing its meaning until the final 30 seconds of the film, 'Memento' is the best film of 2001 so far and it better get raves come Oscar time, or else!",10,0,1,8 September 2001
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Johnny Depp saves 'Lord of the Rings' meets 'The Mummy'
","Let's get one thing straight up front and that is that I am only comparing this film to 'Lord of the Rings' in terms of its gothic action sequences with the ghostly skeletons.  The lighting on these scenes is almost identical to some parts of 'LOTR'.  The shadowy cascade of computer special effects mimic parts of 'The Mummy' with a hero and the damsel in distress fully in hand.  Other than that, Johnny Depp is absolutely outstanding.  His charasmatic and eccentric qualities save this movie and it ranks a 9 out of 10 whenever he is speaking or engaged in the important moments.  Geoffrey Rush is also quite good in his role but when the other actors are present, the film comes off as superficial.  Directed like a pure popcorn summer movie, it's odd that this really isn't a family film because a lot of the dark moments of horror are definitey NOT for young children.  The film also suffers from overlength at almost two and a half hours.  The attention span of children and teenagers is being stretched at such a length.  This movie is worth a look but that's about it.  It makes a good movie as an alternative plan to what you're going to do.  Our party was rained out at golf and we decided to take in this flick.  To make a special trip out to see it would have been a task and Hollywood is already full of tired stories like this and the search (if there is one by the movie industry) for originality goes on!",Null,1,2,20 July 2003
Spider-Man 2," NOT the best super hero movie ever
","Some of the top film critics have called this the greatest super hero movie ever made. Not true. I like the Spider-Man series but I find Tobey Maguire too soft for the role. His looks and his voice don't strike a super hero chord in me. There's NOTHING wrong with his looks or voice, it just isn't for a super hero role. A super hero role needs to have an actor with stern looks and a commanding voice of presence like Michael Keaton or Christopher Reeve in their respective roles as Superman and Batman although, contrary to popular belief, Batman is NOT a super hero because he is mortal and operates with very human qualities. The definition of a super hero is someone who has special powers aside from the mortal way of life.'Spider-Man 2' has great special effects and Alfred Molina's role as Doc Ock is a memorable villain but 'Spider-Man 2' just gets lost in its own mix of elements and it clearly ends setting up the film for a sequel strictly for the purpose of making money. A lot of films do this but this film makes it look SO obvious and having too many people know your true identity weakens your strength as a super hero and while this is good film making, director Sam Raimi directs it by the numbers without clever interjections of his own vision, elements which were also present in the first film.",Null,2,5,21 January 2005
Billy Elliot," The British keep coming!
","What a gifted lot the English are for film production.  Their culture transforms life into art in the most tasteful ways and we are still feeling the effects 20 years later when 'Chariots of Fire' (1981) took home the best picture Oscar thus influencing many British filmmakers to mold their craft accordingly since then.  Jamie Bell and Julie Walters shine brightly as a youthful ballet student and his teacher.  Set in 1984, this film tells two stories just as emotionally.  The one involving Billy Elliot's quest to be a great dancer and the other involves his father and brother's struggle with their labour jobs in the midst of a miner's strike.  I felt almost every emotion possible watching this movie and director Stephen Daldry along with writer Lee Hall have made the most artistic looking film about the arts since Scott Hicks' 'Shine' in 1996.  'Billy Elliot' is again Oscar worthy material from the UK.  Cheers!",Null,6,7,4 February 2001
Finding Nemo," Best animated film since the original 'Toy Story'.

This is a totally original and adventurous story that, like all good animated movies, has appeal to both children and adults.  Only this time, adults will feel like kids more than ever and that is a GOOD THING!  Albert Brooks, Ellen DeGeneres, Alexander Gould and Willem Dafoe are all standouts in this tale which has the classic Pixar stamp all over it.

Brokeback Mountain," The gay issue is simply incidental.
","Let's be clear about something. Late night talk show hosts can poke fun all they want at gay issues but this film is simply a well made and leisurely paced film about love and its consequences. The gay issue, as far as I'm concerned, is simply incidental. I didn't care if it was a story about gay love, straight love, animal love, alien love, materialistic love or any other kind of love. And if you doubt this, ask yourself one simple question. Would Heath Ledger's wife in the film have left him if she discovered he was in love with another woman instead of with another man? Probably. Adultery is adultery. Director Ang Lee took hold of this material and deliberately took his time to tell a story about two lonely and extremely ordinary people and articulated the sensitivity of the perceived issues on screen and treated them with brief visual images of the controversy and made solid acting and acceptable sentimentality rule the screen.",Null,19,21,16 July 2006
Insomnia," A tragic ball of twine!
","Al Pacino doesn't usually play sympathetic characters but I did feel sorry for his character towards the end of this film.  This is one of Pacino's best roles and is certainly his best role in ten years since winning the best actor Oscar for 1992's 'Scent of a Woman'.  In 'Insomnia', Pacino is an L.A. cop who travels to Alaska with a partner to investigate the murder of a young girl.  Once there, he is greeted by an Alaskan police woman (Hilary Swank) and he later tangles with a twisted sicko played superbly by Robin Williams in a limited but fascinating role.  This film has a great dynamite fuse of blackmail, drama, suspense, climate and characterization. Director Christopher Nolan who made the totally under rated 'Memento', scores big here with  a movie that takes a remote setting and shows that crime does occurs anytime and in any place that one can imagine.",Null,0,0,6 July 2002

That is what makes 'The Terminator' the best of all the terminator movies.  ARNOLD HAS EDGE.  The phenomenal editing has the most edge in the entire film and James Cameron's career, along with Arnold's was made.  Watch the second film and see how much of it actually has a lot of slow and dragging spots such as the time spent resting in the desert with the nightmare nuclear dream sequence.  Half an hour could have easily been trimmed from the original theatrical release of T2.  T3 was made simply to keep Arnold's career from fading completely away.

We need a constant reminder that the world's genocide does nothing to solve anyone's problems and 'Hotel Rwanda' casts a positive light on one citizen of Rwanda.....a man named Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), a hotel manger in Rwanda who saved over 1200 people from the genocide by sheltering them in his hotel. Aided by his wife (Sophie Okonedo) a UN general (Nick Nolte), and his staff, Rusesabagina became an important hero that has rightly been characterized in this film by director Terry George and one hopes this film will be remembered as importantly as 1984's 'The Killing Fields'.",Null,3,4,26 February 2005
We Were Soldiers," A bit too much combat.
","As much as I liked this film, I thought it was somewhat disappointing.  I was hoping to add it to my movie library but it is not to be.  Vietnam is now something that belongs in the classic realm of 70's and 80's cinema. Nothing made in the future will ever stand up to 'The Deer Hunter', 'Apocalypse Now' and the best of the bunch...Oliver Stone's 'Platoon' from 1986.  'We Were Soldiers' has just a bit too much combat and not enought strength of character.  I did enjoy seeing the stakes as high as they were in the fact that Mel Gibson has a large family in the movie and this kept hope alive that he wouldn't get killed.  I'm not saying whether he does or not.  Randall Wallace, who wrote 'Braveheart' which was directed by Gibson, writes and directs 'We Were Soldiers' with good steadiness, believable action sequences and a state of the art sound track.  But I just felt the film was too long, too drawn out and rather than show flashes of combat which last a few minutes, Wallace chooses to assault the senses head on and thus fails to make this a film that requires enjoyable multiple viewings.",Null,0,0,24 August 2002

The powerful, the rich, the poor, the middle class and the emotionally disturbed all clash in a film that continues to try and teach us that we are all the same at the same time as we are all different. As I put the pieces of this ensemble together, comparing it to films like the safe and dated 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner', to the eternally relevant and timeless classic 'Do the Right Thing' serve to show 'Crash' as truly unique and invigorating because its tragic and near tragic moments leave it open for debating how we rationalize our fears based on our treatment of each other which often gets out of control as quickly as a fire and we are unable to control it.",Null,0,2,16 July 2006

When 'Alien' was released in 1979, it caused almost as much talk as 'Star Wars' did when released two years earlier. The science fiction genre was being revolutionized at this time and 'Alien' had a horror characteristic to it which was psychological, visually striking and compelling with the type of strength in silence not seen since '2001: A Space Odyssey' in 1968. Definitely a big influence in blockbuster film making, 'Alien' has spawned three sequels so far and is a great horror/science-fiction classic not to be missed.

She ate up the screen with her sexy, smart and deep performance as a young woman trying to find herself. When you upstage the other three leads in this film, you've done something special. Young beauty and brains don't come along too often these days but when they do, they deserves major recognition. Mike Nichols carefully makes sure all the performances intersect in just the right synchronization like his directorial debut in 1966 with 'Who's Afraid of VirginiaWoolf?'.

In 'Groundhog Day' through his constant repetitiveness, he was always able to give the same scene a new interpretation.  And now Murray has matured into a seasoned actor.  Unfortunately, I don't understand what all the raving is about over 'Lost in Translation'.  Sofia Coppola has turned in an admirable but under achieving film as a director.Bob Harris (Murray) is in Japan to film a whiskey commercial and meets Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson).  Each of them is married and they strike up a platonic relationship and talk about the mundane drool that is everyday life with a few bright spots that shine through occasionally.  But that's it.

Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Better than 'The Phantom Menace'
","George Lucas brought in co-writer Jonathan Hales to help him improve over his (Lucas') solo writing effort on 1999's 'The Phantom Menace'.  Even some of the cast of that 1999 film agreed recently that it was a pretty flat effort given the expectations of the 'Star Wars' legacy.  Perhaps it wasn't a bad thing that 'The Phantom Menace' was a little flat because you want the films to get better as you go along, don't you?  Well, 'Attack of the Clones' has a much better outcome because it is dark like 'The Empire Strikes Back' and Lucas is smart.  By making this film he realizes that the darker they get, the more fascinating they become for the mind set of the science fiction fan.  Many hard core 'Star Wars' fans consider 'The Empire Strikes Back' to be the best of ALL 'Star Wars' movies.  'Attack of the Clones' has the best look of ALL the 'Star Wars' films because of the progression of technology in the area of special effects.  I never expected the second coming with the release of these last two films in the last three years and with the upcoming final chapter in 2005..... but it will be interesting to see how Lucas will cap off the first three stories before we can look back on the last three made a generation ago but still, it has a reach to all generations, from ages 8 to 80.",Null,0,1,31 May 2002

Colin Firth and Hugh Grant are the flawed men battling for her affections and at times it seems like she will end up with neither one of them.  Quirky, off beat and unsentimental, this film is a good examination of today's singles who are finding marriage unattractive and relationships even less attractive.

The Aviator," Hollywood tradition preserved!
","The best film of 2004 is a throw back to old Hollywood and has the visuals to back it up. Martin Scorsese directs his most ambitious film to date that will rank as one of his best in the history of his career. Scorsese doesn't use his quintessential style that audiences are used to from his early days in the film industry. Instead, Scorsese's approach to the material here, while unsentimental as his films usually are, is totally majestic in style and matches the maverick personality of it's protagonist Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio). DiCaprio is brilliant as the aviation pioneer, industrialist and film maker who always did things while thinking big in typical American fashion and while he was deeply flawed as a person, he prevented a monopoly in the airline industry that perhaps prevented other monopolies from taking place and saved the true American spirit of competition from being destroyed. Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn and Alan Alda as a corrupt senator add to the support of this film that, along with DiCaprio's performance, make it the grand epic that it will be remembered for.

The Bourne Identity," A jigsaw puzzle.....
","Matt Damon is in excellent condition while passing himself off as a spy in 'The Bourne Identity'.  Outstanding in its combat scenes and clandestine action sequences, this film has one problem.  It resembles the feeling you get when you put together a jigsaw puzzle.  That's not a bad thing. However, once you've done the hard work in putting it together, it doesn't quite look like it lives up to all the hard work that's been put into it. Its final resolution comes off as thin, quickly put together in its writing and the DVD features an alternative last scene ending that has more feeling and speaks to the audience without words.

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," TOO long and too brooding.
","First of all, I have not read any of the books this series is and will be based on.  I just watch for skillful film making.  I found this to be a re-hash of the recent 'Mummy' movies.  Too much action, too little characterizations and too many computerized effects.  You know, what's interesting about the movies is how human nature plays out.  Action films CAN have good characterizations and still be tremendous thunderclaps of entertainment.  Just look at 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'Die Hard'. Great characters and stellar action scenes.  I found 'Lord of the Rings' to be a noble effort but it just seemed to have a wooden and one note style about it.  Presently #1 on the IMDB 250 as the greatest movie ever made? Puh-lease.  Let's not lose our credibility.  Better than 'The Godfather'? 'Citizen Kane'?  'Casablanca'?  Uh-uh.

The Matrix Revolutions," Something for everyone!
","'The Matrix Revolutions' has a conclusion to its story that is somewhat hazy and not clear cut.  But that's Hollywood!  Never say that a trilogy can't be turned into four films.  It's unlikely judging by the disappointing financial and critical outcome this film had which did not live up to expectations but the series ends in a mostly satisfying manner.  My beef with this and 'The Matrix Reloaded' is that meaningful character interaction and deeper development did not take place.  It's not hard to see but as a visual feast, the third film has most of the eye candy.  The second film has some buzzing thrills but the first film will always be the best in the series.

Ed Harris plays a high school football coach in 1976 South Carolina and Cuba Gooding Jr. is Radio, a young black man suffering from withdrawal who cannot speak or communicate properly. Harris helps him out of his shell and on the path to becoming normal. The film is simple, well made but bland.

There is no other performer in thisfilm who even holds a candle to him.  To work for the better half of thisfilm stranded on a desert island, Hanks thoroughly convinced me that he WASstuck on this island and I had to remind myself from time to time that itwas only a movie.  Director Robert Zemeckis stages one of the most realisticplane crashes I have ever seen and the stillness which fills the last frameof the movie with a crossroads as its focus is perfectly executed.  My onlycomplaint is that, as much as I enjoyed Hanks alone on the island, I wouldhave enjoyed periodic flashbacks of his life while stuck alone to develophis character better to show him more dimensionally and not just as asurvivor and this probably would have propelled the film into my top five.Oh, well, at least there was Wilson.   : - )",Null,0,0,31 March 2001

The three of them suffer the daily routine of waiting for the American civil war to end so Inman can be united with Ada.'Cold Mountain' has patchy moments of conflict and unpleasantness and lacks the foundation of tying it all together until the final few minutes.

Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Good attempt and successful execution
","I compare this third installment to the third installment of the 'Godfather' films in terms of how audiences may perceive it even though the genres are completely different.  Let's look at the similarities.  First, there was 16 years between 'The Godfather Part II and III'.  There are 12 years between this and the last 'Terminator' movie.  There are past characters from both films that you long for.  In both cases, the third installment doesn't measure up critically with its other two chapters but, nevertheless, you're glad it was made.  'Terminator III' has several things going for it.  Nick Stahl has far more appeal and better acting ability than the whiney and annoying Edward Furlong.  The computer effects look better than ever and the resolution of this third film stirs up debate better than ever about fate vs. choice and which one decides the future.  Arnold has lost a lot of edge since the original film in 1984 but he has some good lines, still looks physically convincing in the role and the biggest surprise of all for me was Claire Danes.  I thought her role would be written in as an unnecessary replacement for the absent Linda Hamilton but we see that her character is important to the fate of the future. Director Jonathan Mostow is no James Cameron but he has a strong industrial vision for action, keeps every second of this movie interesting and likens its running time closer to the first film than the second and this is a plus because there are parts of 'T2' that really dragged for me and half an hour could have been chopped off its original theatrical release.  'T3' is more tight than the second film.  It's open for a fourth film and I recommend it because it JUST FEELS RIGHT!",Null,0,0,9 July 2003

","I love 'T2' but it isn't as good as the original film.  People are fooled by it because, yes, it does look better.  But as a FILM with all the elements in place and evaluated, this film has less edge and a running time that is too long.  Although it won four technical Oscars, James Cameron's vision in the first film is far more clear and original.  Arnold looks far more menacing as a bad guy.  He looked younger and much hungrier for action in the first film and Michael Biehn was a great character as Reese who, unfortunately, had to get killed off.",Null,3,5,2 August 2003
Apocalypse Now," REDUX reward ! !
","I was amazed at just how good the new footage was.  Premiering at Cannes early in 2001, Coppola introduced us to a three hour plus version entitled 'Apocalypse Now Redux'.  I wasn't disappointed with any of it and actually prefer the new footage added to the old version.  It basically gives us a more towering introduction to Kilgore's character, his surfing antics gone awry, the mission boat's passengers meeting up with the Playboy bunnies later on down the river when their helicopter runs out of fuel and a scene of war politics discussed at a French plantation where Willard and his men land.  Little extra pieces appear at other points as well and 'Apocalypse Now', the most surreal film about Vietnam ever made, shows that with the problems that plagued its production, it probably turned out better since the people involved in the production went through hell, just as the men who fought there did.

From the team that brought brought us the somewhat dumb but grandly entertaining 'Independence Day' in 1996, director Roland Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin have fashioned a story with a legend like Mel Gibson and a strong new comer like Heath Ledger.  This is the kind of film that can only be made in America.  It has an unwaivering amount of sheer glory in the celebration of its conflict and characters who hate to lose.  It is technically flawless and another chapter in the great career of Mel Gibson who has long surpassed the fading Harrison Ford as one of the most admired and enduring move star legends in our present time.",Null,1,2,4 September 2000
Spider-Man," Too young?
","Date: 31 May 2002 Summary: Too young?I thought that Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst were a little too young to be in these roles but I guess since 40% of the movie market audience is people between 18 and 24, this was a recommendation of the focus group hired to decide the outcome of the film's release. Overall, though, it was impressive. This film has been tossed around Hollywood for over a decade by people such as James Cameron and the struggle with Marvel comics to get the film rights was no easy task. Willem Dafoe was a great villain given his past in such films as 'Shadow of the Vampire', 'Speed 2' and 'Streets of Fire'. The special effects are impressive and we are continuing to see things in today's films that we have never seen before and this is one of those films. Director Sam Raimi who has been involved with 'The Evil Dead' movies and the first 'Darkman' movie, injects a venom of serious menace into this film and it's one that is done with motives by its characters for what their choices are and it is well written and not too long, like some action films are!

Cruise deserves every penny, award and praise he's ever received. Director Michael Mann builds tension and explodes it like a land mine from time to time with believable visuals and an explosive pace to boot.

It's designed to keep your stomach in knots from start to finish.With all that he has accomplished up to and including the year 2004, including three Oscars for 1997's 'Titanic', this is still James Cameron's best film. Superior to the first film because the characters are developed to be more cherished to the audience while the first hour has all of the silence and slow burn that the original had without looking the same.

The Exorcist," Friedkin's redemption?
","I recently saw the re-issue of 'The Exorcist' with about 12 minutes of new footage, a re-mixed sound track and a print cleaned up for today and it looks as fresh as the day it was released.  It is by far the best horror film ever made and a thought provoking essay on the supernatural with religious overtones that paved the way for many of today's horror films. The new footage is a redemption for director William Friedkin.  I don't understand why he didn't use this new footage originally in the 1973 version.  Perhaps Friedkin thought it would be too literal in the point he was trying to make.  My only criticism is the ending which WAS better in the original version but the other footage definitely belongs here and with its recent box office success I hope we can look forward to other older films being released in the near future.",10,1,2,7 October 2000
Pearl Harbor," Jealous, are we?
","What is all the criticism of this film about?  It plays out perfectly.  You can't be too harsh on this film since it was written by Randall Wallace who wrote 'Braveheart' and we all know how much people love that film.  The performances by Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale are solid and heartfelt.  Jon Voight was amazing as FDR and I truly believe he could get an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor.  'Pearl Harbor' plays out perfectly.  The first part is the romance angle, the second part is the attack and its aftermath and the third part is the U.S. retaliation against Japan.  I think the reason a lot of people didn't like this film is because of the jealousy towards the superiority of the American military and fighting spirit which is the best in the world.  At least it is in the opinion of this Canadian.  The U.S. came back from terrible odds to, for the most part, win World War II.  My only complaint is the editing which I thought was poorly timed.

After an hour, it just seemed so long and by the time it was over it felt like three hours instead of its running time of 113 minutes. Ashton Kutcher really surprised me with the range of emotions he displayed here as his life and the lives of others around him changed. A friend of mine commented that the film failed because as the changes in time were occurring, we didn't see the effects on the whole world like we did in the 'Back to the Future' films in the plot involving Biff becoming rich and corrupt. Instead, the intimacies of the characters were the focus of change here.

'Remember the Titans' has the exact same leading character in Denzel Washington and the same type of climax and feel good flavour and it works.  There is one emotional scene in Gettysburg where Washington explains to his players the value of working together and it doesn't fix the race problem entirely which is affecting the players but it greatly improves the team's situation and the entire movie is never boring for a second.

'The Pianist' is about one man's quest for survival and following his odyssey through all of the horrors of history's darkest time.  All films about the holocaust are relevant but few films such as this one overall have such a power that comes from such little dialogue.  Adrien Brody is a Polish pianist in 1939 when war breaks out in his country.  He is separated from his family and must survive in the most terrible ways.  Director Roman Polanski, who has memories of his own from the holocaust, directs this film with the pain and horror of that time still locked in his mind.  You can see it in every frame.

Seabiscuit," Simplicity rules....
","There is no doubt that 'Seabiscuit' is a feel good movie.  This is probably the most simple film in terms of its storytelling and execution since 1990's 'Dances with Wolves'.  It benefits greatly from having its three main characters (Tobey Maguire, Jeff Bridges and Chris Cooper) come together in a totally accidental twist of fate.  As the owner (Jeff Bridges) of an underdog horse, a seasoned horse trainer and frontiersman (Chris Cooper) and a jockey (Tobey Maguire) make their way through the trials and tribulations of the sport of kings, their horse Seabiscuit manages to win at almost every turn once all the pieces of the puzzle fall into place. 
Written for the screen and directed by Gary Ross, this is a simple old fashioned story that makes the film industry respectable in this time of degrading sex comedies, computer overkill on special effects and empty dreadful slasher films.

Child abuse, poverty, unemployment, over taxation, racism and other injustices and society is just as culpable as the criminals it produces.  However, this film is just sheer repetition.  It shows us criminals in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, stealing, killing and ganging since childhood.  But because it has nowhere else to go after that, except when they become adults and do the same things, I found this film tiresome after about the first hour.Having seen thousands of movies in life I always try to look for a way to accept the message given by all films but this film just didn't cut it for me as it was just low brow criminals running around the streets.

How many comic book films do we need to see shoved in our faces with enough computer effects to fill a dozen movies.

Perhaps this is the way many interpret the book and for that matter, that may be the very core of the way it is supposed to look from the words on the original pages.  I just don't see anything that shines through that makes you care that the good guys win.  Films like 'Star Wars' and 'Braveheart' (although the good guy lost here it was still still fun when he was winning) have much more feeling and sentiment combined with booming action and terrific characters. I just see 'LOTR' as bleak, too dark and too under developed in its characterizations and I found some of the creatures to be inaudible when they spoke.

School of Rock," A great re-introduction of history.
","This film is a miracle.  It introduces today's young people to an older generation of music that mattered.  Today's music (if you can call it that) is based largely on marketing and not talent.  The criminal element is given too much opportunity and exposure and shouldn't even be given the time of day.  A lot of today's acts lip-synch at concerts, dress up in sexy tight clothing (or wear very little clothing) and a lot of the female artists look like strippers instead of pop stars.  Classic rock's style of music sold itself with very little promotion because it was so good. 
Jack Black plays a man who masquerades as a substitute teacher and introduces his 5th graders to rock and roll from the likes of such immortals as Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, The Doors and The Who.  The kids respond very well and learn that not only is the music important but that it's fun to learn about.Black learns a lot about himself in the process and turns his meaningless life around while he helps educate a group of kids in the process.  Director Richard Linklater has a very steady approach to this film, knows when to inject humour and knows when to keep the tone serious.  It's a very well developed film and I honestly think Jack Black could get an Oscar nomination for this film because his character is honest, passionate and totally convincing.  And the academy loves good teacher performances.  A gem of a film!!  And where did Linklater get the idea of injecting 1988's 'Bonzo Goes to Bitburg' by the Ramones halfway through the film as a montage to the film's progress in the first act?

Director Baz Luhrmann cuts his film too rapidly.  Sure, rhythm is important to a film but his film is cut like an action piece and not a musical.  Legendary dancer Fred Astaire would ask his directors to use the editing as little as possible during his dance numbers and the audience absorbed them perfectly.

'Million Dollar Baby' shows that Clint is making the best movies of his career over the last 15 years. Unlike 'Rocky' where the fight is uproarious as you cheer and the hero gets the girl in the end, 'Million Dollar baby' shows how ugly boxing violence is and why the sport has degenerated into a low brow competition in recent years.Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman deserve Oscars for this film as their performances are raw, heartfelt and just plain worthy. Eastwood also deserves his second Oscar as best director and this film is superior, yes, superior I say to Martin Scorsese's over rated 'Raging Bull' from 1980.

","'Kill Bill Vol. 1' is the most violent movie made since Oliver Stone's 1994 blood soaked 'Natural Born Killers'.  Ironically, that film was written by Tarantino.  It is a well known fact that Tarantino has an on going feud with Stone over the way Tarantino thought Stone misdirected that film.  For some strange reason, there are amazing similarities between the way Tarantino directs KB and the way Stone directed NBK.  Unusual to say the least.  They both use ultra-violence that's over the top at times, animation mixed in with the live action and black and white is also used in both films.  A chuckle can also be had by the fact that both films are photographed by Robert Richardson.  On another note, Stone admits that he went way over the top with NBK and I wonder if Tarantino will ever think and/or admit the same for KB.  I also have to question the legitimacy of KB as far as credibility is concerned in its believability.  But then I thought, 'What the heck, Tarantino has proven his skills as a talented writer and director so he's entitled to go wild this time.'  'Kill Bill Vol. 1' is an expert action film that has superbly choreographed fight scenes, top notch editing and great photography.  For that I have to recommend this film.  If you want to see a film that is well written and acted, forget it.  KB is NOT that kind of film.  It is simply an action film, no more no less with homages paid to Japanese mythology and the chop-saki action films from the 60's and 70's.  Tarantino loves to rekindle the 70's and should audition for a guest spot on 'That 70's Show' or better yet, try and direct an episode of that well liked show.  Tarantino's love of 70's music is also a plus.KB is destined to become a cult favourite and one little tidbit that has to be mentioned is the fact that in the closing credits, Tarantino thanks Governor Gray Davis and the state of California.  Interesting in that the same week this film was released, Arnold Schwarzenegger replaced Gray Davis as the governor of California.  Long live the insanity of the golden state and the wild imagination of the movies!!!",Null,0,0,13 October 2003
Mission: Impossible II," ONE OF THE WORST OF 2000
","This is the most boring action film I have ever seen.  What made the first 'Mission Impossible' movie so good was the fact that it LACKED action!  It told a compelling story about a complicated mole hunt and paid off.  This film is a typical James Bond type story about a deadly virus falling into the wrong hands.  Cruise is under developed as Ethan Hunt, Thandie Newton is just another pretty love interest with no stamina in her own character and director John Woo stages the action scenes like television commercials for fast motorcycles and advertisements for movie theme park rides.  Truly a dismal and flat action picture that even uses Anthony Hopkins in a limited cameo to market its presence and make audiences think that two stars like Hopkins and Cruise can't fail.  Yes, they can!  At least like all bad sequels, it made me appreciate the original a whole lot more.",Null,1,1,4 September 2000
Black Hawk Down," Absolutely brilliant!
","This film is a four star knockout!  This film must receive a best picture Oscar nomination as it is one of the greatest combat films ever made. Brilliant combat scenes that are in some ways, better than the scenes in 'Saving Private Ryan'.  The cinematography, while admirable in SPR, is not as headache inducing here.  Ridley Scott does not have long stretches between the combat and non combat sequences and the film shoots by like an hour.  There is an equal mix of both.  Scott gets into a scene just when its interesting and gets out before it wears out its welcome.  There is great male bonding between the soldiers as the motto in Somalia was that no U.S. soldier gets left behind.  The graphic sequences are difficult to watch but are well edited and the shock value, visually, only last a few seconds for each but resonates so well in the mind.  As an eighteen hour combat scenario that was only supposed to last thirty minutes, 'Black Hawk Down' shows that the cynics around the world who believe that the U.S. only fights when money is involved, are thankfully proven wrong by this film which shows a blend of forgotten heroes, devastating famine and a series of interacting peace keeping forces that did what they could to help a situation that could have been worse without at least some effort.",Null,0,0,31 January 2002
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A funhouse of low emotional tinkering
","This movie did something very original. Unfortunately for me it did not strike the emotional chord necessary in a love story. I wanted to feel more for the characters than what I actually did. I thought the scenes of Ruffalo and Dunst getting stoned while Carrey's mind erasure was taking place was out of character for the film. It just seemed so opposite to the point the film was trying to make. But the scenes where Carrey has second thoughts about his love for Winslet and then tries to resist his mind erasure and we see the visuals in his head play out was something special. A good film but not a great one. At the time of this review it stands at #32 all time on the IMDb's top 250 films list. Come on, guys. Better than love stories with great sub plots like 'On the Waterfront', 'The Apartment' and 'City Lights'? I think not!",Null,1,3,22 January 2005
Mission: Impossible," Tom Cruise is on cruise control...
","Tom Cruise is a good actor regardless of what anyone says.  He has held his own while acting alongside such legends a Dustin Hoffman, Paul Newman and Robert Duvall.  He has also taken direction extremely well from veterans such as Oliver Stone, Stanley Kubrick and Martin Scorsese.  If Cruise wasn't any good, do you really think these actors and directors of such a high stature would want to work with him?  In 'Mission Impossible' Cruise creates an secret agent character that is sort of a miniature James Bond.  Cool, unshaken and physical at every tense moment, Cruise's Ethan Hunt is a great character.  Brian De Palma's direction is static as usual but the story (which takes multiple viewings in order to figure out the REAL plot) and Cruise's on screen charisma make 'Mission Impossible' one of the more respectable films to be based on a classic t.v. series when so many of them are nothing but junk.  This film is a winner.",Null,2,4,9 August 2003
The Last Samurai," Traditional and accurate from a historical point of view.
","There is a scene in 'The Last Samurai' where the son of a samurai warrior says that his father taught him that it is glorious to die in battle.  A lot of films have taken criticism for glorifying war and one of them is 1989's 'Glory'.  'The Last Samurai', like 'Glory', was directed by Edward Zwick and the issue of war glorification is neither right or wrong.  It's what the individual fighting for what he or she believes in is right or wrong.  It is left up to individual interpretation and allowing a person to think for themselves.Set in 1876, it appears that in 'The Last Samurai', the story revolves around the Japanese government's wish that like the United States, commerce and building a nation is worth killing its traditional people for. Traditional people in America being the Indians, who were slaughtered and driven off their land between 1850 and 1900 for the exploitation of railroad construction, gold mining and oil drilling.  The Japanese emperor in this film is obsessed with Western ideology so much so, that he hires an American civil war hero (Tom Cruise) to use this methodology to take out the last batch of samurai warriors whose traditional methods that have protected their country for centuries are now slowing down the exploitation of the Japanese country for profit.Cruise's character is Captain Nathan Algren, a man who participated in the American Indian wars and is haunted by his conscience for the slaughter of innocent people while his superiors believe it is the right thing to do. Algren is captured in battle and forced to learn the samurai way of life. Upon doing so, he becomes embodied in their way of life and embraces it against his own people in the name of justice.  Director Edward Zwick has made a film from a different time where beliefs were very different than they are today and because of this, those who believe in political correctness will attack this film and misunderstand it like they did 'Gladiator' and 'Braveheart'.  Learning something about a different time and place is beneficial in light of all of the Hollywood down sizing in terms of quality film making in recent years and this film is going to be a sensational Oscar contender for many awards including picture, director and actor and Cruise could win an Oscar after three previous tries. This is going to be his best shot to date.  And Ken Watanabe, who plays the samurai leader, is sensational in his own way and I hope he is not forgotten when the Oscar nominations are announced for supporting actor.",Null,1,2,7 December 2003
Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick's swan song.
","Kubrick worked for two years in the final process, filming his last picture which is an appropriate swan song for those who understand his vision and those who don't.  That aspect of his work never changed throughout the decades and there's no reason to believe that Kubrick would change to conventional film making so late in life.  Kubrick would also stick to his re-occurring theme of dehumanization for his final film.Carrying this film for the better part of the way the same as he did in 'Born on the Fourth of July' is Tom Cruise.  Forget his marketable name, forget his early juvenile films and give this man the credit he deserves. Cruise exhibits sexual frustration and a wrestling match with his conscience superbly in this film as a man with an unwavering amount of decency in the perverse world he discovers.  It's a challenge any actor would have difficulty with and Cruise holds his own with any other actor that could have played this role.  Two Oscar nominations and his ability to act equally as well opposite Dustin Hoffman, Jack Nicholson and Paul Newman (who heaped well deserved praise on Cruise), make Cruise that rare commodity of actor AND movie star and those who don't see his talent can only hope to in the future.",10,0,0,17 July 1999
The Matrix Reloaded," Waiting four years for this!
","You know, I like 'The Matrix Reloaded'.  But after waiting four years, I expected much more.  The character development and interaction does not move forward one bit.  Thinking back to 'The Empire Strikes Back', what a great sequel that was for advancing the character's lives forward.  Here, there is a terrifying new advance by agent Smith, who manges to duplicate himself in seemingly unstoppable numbers but that's all that got me interested in this film.  It is fun to watch but is NOTHING compared to the first film. Disappointing but still fun to watch with a great highway chase scene that blows away the rest of the film.",Null,0,0,4 January 2004
Mystic River," A classic slow burn!
","Clint Eastwood's films have always been slowly paced but are usually absorbing in a very satisfactory manner if you allow yourself to watch his films to the very end.  'Mystic River' is no exception to this rule.  This is Eastwood's most powerful film since since Oscar winning 'Unforgiven' in 1992.  Eastwood has said that he likes working with actors who can direct.  Here, Sean Penn and Tim Robbins, both of whom I hope will be Oscar nominees for best actor and best supporting actor, are former directors with Robbins getting an Oscar nomination for his work behind the camera on 1995's 'Dead Man Walking' when he directed Sean Penn who is also a fine director in his own way.'Mystic River' is the story of lower middle class people in Boston who have to deal with tragedies of the past and present.  Their lives are turned upside down as the past seems to affect the present and we see that wounds of the soul never fully heal in this life.  Sean Penn's 19 year old daughter is murdered and two police officers (Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne) search for answers to this horrible crime.Tim Robbins gives the best performance in the film as a man trying to cope in his adulthood with being kidnapped, confined, beaten and raped as a child by two grown men.  His zombie like persona is astonishing to watch.  He has a constantly blank, meaningless expression to reflect the pain.  The torment and sadness in his life are something you would not wish on your worst enemy.Scripted by Brian Helgeland from the book by Dennis Lehane, 'Mystic River' is a cold, bleak, depressing but ultimately watchable and fascinating film dealing with powerful issues that affect everyday average people.  The film's character development leaves you feeling something strange.  You'll feel and perceive something about the characters Penn and Robbin play when the film is over as opposed to what you saw when the film's main strengths start coming through earlier in the film and I haven't seen that too often in the movies.",Null,0,0,31 October 2003

A Beautiful Mind," Ron Howard's best film
","This is Ron Howard's best film without question.  There has always been an element of fluff with Howard's movies.  Not always but frequently.  This is a masterpiece of intelligence with Oscar worthy performances by both Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly.  The film tackles mental illness with subtlety and yet at the same time with a great deal of power without sensationalizing its subject.  I was moved at the boundaries between illusion and reality and was relieved to finally know which was which.  But most importantly, this is a love story.  John Nash would not have been able to overcome his problems without his wife, Alicia.  She was the foundation for his return to functional life.  The espionage angle is quick, shallow and perfect for tying in the film's real meaning.  One of the best films of 2001, this film is almost on par with the mother of all mental illness films, 1975's 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'.  Ron Howard has come a very long way.",Null,0,2,6 January 2002

Jamie Foxx gives one of the most realistic performances in the history of the movies with his portrayal of Ray Charles. He IS Ray Charles. He has to win the Oscar. There is no other competition from 2004 and if Foxx doesn't win the Oscar, it will be the biggest blemish on the Academy's reputation in a very long time.

Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz are all perfect in lending their voices to the appropriate character.

Clarice Starling's point of view when she first lays eyes on Lecter.  The double murder of the guards in Hannibal's Memphis cell is probably the most terrifying scene ever filmed. Anthony Hopkins proves that quality and not quantity is the key to a best actor Oscar as his part is extremely small but effective.  Jodie Foster holds her own with him and you believe every second of her performance. Jonathan Demme's direction is superb and he stamps the film with a sure footed sense of style and chilling effectiveness.

Penelope Cruz hurts the film as she is only a pretty little thing striving to swim with the big fish but is not quite able to keep up.  Jason Lee turns in a good performance as Cruise's best friend and from 'Jerry Maguire' to 'Almost Famous' to 'Vanilla Sky', this is Crowe's weakest film but still one worth viewing only once although it is very difficult to follow and if you like the film enough, you may need many viewings to figure out everything because the film shifts around so much.

You saw too much of the shark in the latter film mentioned and the thrills wore off early.  'Identity' has too much gore and too much detachment from what makes a good stoy memorable and for one, I felt cheated to be watching a movie that was primarily set inside one man's head.  It would have been better to have the psychotic (Pruitt Taylor Vince) as the main character and work in a better stoy line.  Ray Liotta and John Cusack are above the platform of fantasy characters who don't exist and deserve better than this. Director James Mangold has a few brief moments of terror but this is essentially a slasher film with shallow results.  If this review sounds weird, it's a direct interpretation of the film.

I don't think Peter Jackson is a very skilled director or writer because with all the bombastic computer special effects that this trilogy has had, there is little room for any real meaningful acting or writing.  The  previous films I mentioned also lacked some of that but the producing and directing skills of George Lucas and Steven Spielberg made you want to watch them over and over again.'The Return of the King' is the most grim and foreboding of the three films and has a feeling comparable to being sucked into a black hole.

Munich," Terror's impact and the endless cycle of violence.
","Steven Spielberg is far from done as a film maker. As a 30+ year veteran of the big screen, Spielberg is continuing to evolve and re-invent himself with each decade.

'Munich' takes no side in the dispute between two sides in the most volatile conflict of the last 50 years on planet Earth. By taking no side, Spielberg has managed to take both sides and show them as equally flawed and equally human. The subject matter is the star performer of this film and the actors are merely taking their cues from it and while this film has been heavily criticized for its politics, no matter how this film was presented, it would have been criticized.

Thirteen Days," A test of dialogue writing!
","Writer David Self did himself a favour by not working on this script with anyone else.  As a self written screenplay based on the book The Kennedy Tapes - Inside the White House During the Cuban Missile Crisis by Ernest R. May and Philip D. Zelikow, Self has manufactured a painstakingly difficult script filled with the merry go round of conflict between the U.S. and the USSR in October 1962.  These two nations almost went to war over the Russian's stockpile of nuclear missiles in Cuba and the U.S. stockpile in Turkey.  Both sides are made to look responsible for this conflict.  The snappy direction by Roger Donaldson put me in mind of some of his most tense moments during 1987's No Way Out' which also starred Kevin Costner.  Here, Costner plays Kenny O'Donnell, the President's highest ranking aide.  Bruce Greenwood, a Canadian, and Steven Culp, play John and Robert Kennedy with accents which are mastered beautifully.  This film is never boring.  The frenzy becomes a bit much after the first hour and forty-five minutes and then continues for another forty minutes or so but as a lesson in history, it seems, for a film, pretty authentic to its historical facts.

Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Darker, more fluid advancement in the story line but not necessarily better
","George Lucas' 'Star Wars' trilogy is the greatest fantasy story in all of film history. Yes, even better than the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. 'Lord of the Rings' is fine work but the characters aren't as well developed as in 'Star Wars' and they are too long. Also, each 'Star Wars' film stands out better than each 'Lord of the Rings' film. Three chapters in 'Lord of the Rings' is one big movie while 'Star Wars' is a space western, 'The Empire Strikes Back' is a dark, attractive and Gothic work of art and 'Return of the Jedi' is like a Disney film. Each has their own personality. As far as trilogies go altogether, 'The Godfather' films will always be the greatest in movie history'.I love 'The Empire Strikes Back' but I can't go along with the assertion that it is better than 'Star Wars'. I was one of those people that saw 'Star Wars' every weekend for a year when I was 11 and 12 years when a child's admission was only 50 cents to a dollar. There was such a magnificent freshness to 'Star Wars' that audiences couldn't get enough and when adjusted for inflation, 'Star Wars' is the second biggest box office film is history, second only to 1939's 'Gone with the Wind'. Meaning that these two films sold the most tickets in motion picture history.'Star Wars' even created the entire concept of the modern day blockbuster and influenced hundreds of films after it, is the biggest movie in the history of popular culture and created a new religion. A recent poll in Britain asked people to identify their religion and a substantial portion of them wrote in 'Jedi Knight'.'The Empire Strikes Back' does advance the story line forward greatly, has a convincing and blossoming love story between Han Solo and Pricess Leia and gives us the showdown we want. It also introduces us to the legendary Yoda and a new key player in Lando Calrissian and has some breath taking special effects. But 'The Empire Strikes Back' owes its success to 'Star Wars' but has to be given credit for the fact that it teaches people, especially the young, that the good guys don't always win and that the fight for what's right sometimes seems impossible.",10,4,7,23 January 2005
Gangs of New York," Scorsese's Oscar to come....
","At last it is finally here.  This is the film that will win Martin Scorsese his long awaited Oscar for best director.

It is a sweeping epic of forgotten proportions as Americans and those around the world will be educated in how America, the real America, was built.  Daniel Day-Lewis cannot be praised enough for this film.  His volatile performance as a gang leader who controls politics and law enforcement in 19th century New York is frightening and tragic at the same time.  He never shows any sign of weakness in both his character or his performance.  He was robbed of a second Oscar for 1993's 'In the Name of the Father' and I hope he will get his reward here.  It is truly the best performance by an actor in a leading role in 2002...no question about it.  Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz are good but not great (Leo is better in 'Catch Me If You Can') and the cast is rounded off with quality turns by Jim Broadbent and John C. Reilly. Attention to period detail is second to none and the editing is put forward in a way that makes three hours just fly by.

Action sequences have to have rhythm, no question, but when you leap from rhythm to a mere blip, you leave the audience with no clear picture of what the action looked like, but rather what it felt like. The best action sequence in film history is in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' when Indiana Jones rescues of the ark from the truck line formed by the Nazis.

I liked the subject matter and the idea of the film a lot more than its execution, which admittedly, is flawed. Depression era people struggling to make something out of their lives. Crowe's children in the film represent my father's family and his siblings growing up.
