Black Swan," Swan Queen
","I also watched this movie when I was in a low mood period and this is one of my most favorite movies! I even want to have a black swan tattoo on my body!
Sometimes, people show affection on things or people are alike themselves. Back then, I feel Nina is like me. She wants to be a perfect dancer and meanwhile she is too fragile to handle some situations so she feels painful and questions herself all the time. The outside and inside both make her feel unsafe so she is trying hard to get rid of it and the chains from her mother.
This is a sad story but I think it has a perfect ending. All her emotions are being poured out and she let dream come true.
I love her evil and satisfying smile when she turns to black swan!
I also love the music when Nina having sex with Lily. The tattoo on Lily's back makes her look like flying! That's awesome!
I love the whole story idea, just using simple scenes to unfold anxiety and aspiration before our eyes.",9,0,0,5 January 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Love this movie!
","I was touched by the music! Even I am a layman in music.
I was touched by two scenes, one is billboards are in fire, one is police office gets fired.
Sad but inspiring movie!",8,1,3,26 February 2018
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Rooney Mara is so cool
","I watched this movie because Rooney Mara! And she doesn't let me down!
Actually, when I was watching, I put more attention on her than whole story and I thought she is one of the most important reasons make this film great.
Lisbeth Salander hides herself in a cold shell but she can be very sensitive deep in soul. Her superb skills give her a condition to live like that but she still needs to face evils alone.
Hope life can treat these people with kind.
Love Rooney Mara!!!",7,0,1,5 January 2018
Inside Out," Best cartoon movie in my heart
","I watched this movie when I am not in a good mood period and I cried a lot during watching. I was surprised by the whole idea of the movie because it shows a different world explaining how we act daily in a reasonable way. Furthermore, I was touched by the fact that things truly get destroyed but don't worry, we can still get better things after that cruel experience.
I was afraid of destruction but this movie gives me huge courage to face the future!",9,1,6,5 January 2018
