Catch Me If You Can," Hanks vs Dicaprio: The Mad Men Years...
","Spielberg did it again with this one. After the entertaining but overrated Minority Report, he brought us one of his most effortlessly fun films in a long time. I caught myself grinning from ear to ear many times throughout the movie. DiCaprio turns in his finest performance since What's Eating Gilbert Grape & The Basketball Diaries. Even though the story is based on a true story/autobiography of Frank Abagnale Jr., it all seems like some crazy Hollywood plot that's just too irresistible not to love. As for the rest of the cast, Tom Hanks is (as always) thoroughly reliable as the G-man set on catching Abagnale. Christopher Walken steals every scene he exists in as dad Frank Abagnale Sr., Frank Jr.'s impetus and inspiration for his outlandish check fraud spree. Like father, like son indeed. Martin Sheen and Jennifer Garner make delightful appearances in key scenes and John Williams' score is top notch, perfectly catching the snappy-cool kitsch of the 60's in every note. It's all a refreshing mix of everything we've come to fall in love with the movies. Some may be taken aback by the lackadaisical pacing, expecting some action set piece to pop up - and thank Odin there weren't any to be found",8,2,3,9 November 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The Best Film Of The New Millennium (So Far...)
","Look...Don't listen to the stodgy critics and the disgruntled loser fan boys: this is a great and beautiful work of art. The sheer magnitude and scope of the movie alone is astonishing. A lot of people out there fail to grasp the concept that literature and film are two radically different forms of entertainment (mind you, I emphasize entertainment). Just because the film version of a book does not have certain parts in it or a few characters have been altered for pacing sake, doesn't mean that it's not a worthy adaptation. Comparing a book and a movie is like comparing the Peloponnesian Wars with the War On Drugs. Why would you want to? ...Exactly. The fact of the matter is that I seriously doubt a better film version of Fellowship could ever be made. The very spirit of the book - adventuresome and epic but human and personal at the same time - has been captured excitingly in Peter Jackson's film. I'm not even going to waste my time with explaining the plot or characters because those are by now a foregone conclusion. Every single performance in this film is top notch. I didn't notice a bad line delivery or breaking of character nor 'phoning in of lines' at all. 3 hours of epic fun is really what this is. I repeat the word epic because this is the best word to describe the film. Epic. It is the definition of the word.Never before has there EVER been a film that has captured the essence of the fantasy epic like this one; and judging by this first chapter, the entire trilogy will be a towering achievement in the least. Legend? Nope. Willow? Nah. Krull? Please. Dragonslayer? Nice Try. The classic Sinbad films and Clash Of The Titans are the only ones that even come close to touching this baby in the greatness department. But there's no stop motion animation here folks. The effects, the scenery and the actors all blend together to create a fantastic world of grandeur and excitement. Not once while watching did I say 'that looks so fake' or 'he's not right for the part' or even 'this is too long, is it over yet?' A movie like this needs to be AT LEAST 3 hours to tell a coherent story and to get the essence of the book nailed down. That's where Bakshi's animated 2-hour effort from the 70's Tolkien revival failed. Sure, there are a few things that keep Jackson's movie from being 'perfect' - sometimes the pacing seems a little repetitious and there are a few moments that ordinary viewers who are not fans of the book might be confused with. But these are so minor compared to the rest of the film that they're hardly noticeable. BOTTOM LINE: This is simply bliss for any fantasy/action/epic fan or even the casual moviegoer looking for a grand ol' yarn to settle down to. The best movie of the new millennium by far (I know, it's only been a few years, but this film will undoubtedly stand the test of time) and an instant classic. See it. Rent it. Buy it. Watch it. Again. And Again. And Again. It'll never be enough. It has an insanely high re-watch value. And that, my friends, is priceless in the movie world.",10,1,1,21 October 2002
Alien vs. Predator," I'll See You One ClichÃ© And Raise You Two Wasted Opportunities!
","How does one even write a review of this movie without trying to commit suicide? Looking back at all of the classic films that came from these two franchises (Predator, Alien & Aliens) it makes me sad to see this abomination of a 'double-sequel' half-assed for everyone to see. It's out there for the masses to observe. There's no hiding it. If done by someone who actually cared about the source material and the back story of these two franchises, this film could have been something very special and just plain exciting. I don't mean an Academy Award-worthy effort, here. Just common sense and a flair for adventure/sci-fi cinema. It seems Anderson and his whole crew lack both of these skills. The cast that has been assembled, including Sanaa Lathan and Lance Henriksen himself, are all very competent and sci-fi friendly. Also, the special effects are all well done and lovely to behold. The problem lies in the story and execution of the whole affair. The plot seems extremely slight, compared to even the last two Alien movies. Predator 2 is a classic compared to AvP (notwithstanding, P2 is indeed quite a guilty pleasure). Most lovers of sci-fi action and adventure will ask themselves if they saw what they really saw after the movie ends. 'Is that all?' I really wanted to like and enjoy this flick, but in the end there was no way on earth I could embrace such a corporate, lifeless, thrown-together piece of studio propaganda. If it had been made by someone more competent and the tone had been more suited to the material, I guarantee you it would have at least made double at the box office. It had no legs and disappeared from the landscape shortly after it debuted. What a waste and what an utter disappointment this all turned out to be.",4,0,1,9 November 2011
The Insider," Al Pacino & Russell Crowe tag team Big Tobacco in a Royal Rumble of great acting!
","Guess what? A 2 1/2 hour drama about big tobacco can actually be a lot of fun. To begin with, I ended up in the theater for only one reason - Pacino. The man is great in absolutely anything he does; I don't give a rotten rat's butt what anyone says about him being tired or frequently overacting, that's all a load of hooey. Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised to see Crowe take the brunt of the acting and really run with it. He was superb in this film and deserved the ocsar for best actor this year (sorry Spacey...you were good, but not that good). Pacino and Christopher Plummer both added to the mix as volatile elements in a taut and well-directed film by a truly great filmmaker who has lots more chances to shine - Michael Mann (Heat and Last Of The Mohicans are two of the best films of the decade). Hell, even Wings Hauser and Phillip Baker Hall get in on the act and deliver great performances as well. Amazing. If you haven't seen this movie yet...what in the name of Scorsese are you waiting for? Brilliant acting, brilliant cinematography, and an astonishing cast and script add up to without a doubt, the best film of the year - American Beauty, for all it's merits, was way overrated in my opinion. Though it may seem overlong, true film fans will appreciate the scope of this amazing film. Kudos to Mann and Co.",8,0,0,17 May 2000
Valkyrie," Is That A Bomb In Your Briefcase, Or Are You Just Happy To See Me?
","The best compliment I can give Valkyrie is that it is so well-made that it makes you actually believe for a moment that they might actually pull it off. Then reality hits back and you realize this will all end badly. That up-and-down of emotions perfectly fits Valkyrie and makes it one of the best thrillers in recent memory. It features one of the juiciest casts ever assembled in a modern film - Tom Cruise, Terence Stamp, Eddie Izzard, Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Hollander, Tom Wilkinson, Ian McNeice and Carice Van Houten are just some of the standouts in a solid gathering of actors. There are an infinite number of amazing but true stories that came out of WWII and this is definitely in the top ten for sure. Christian Berkel's bomb expert Colonel has the best line of the film: 'Any problem on Earth can be solved with the careful application of high explosives. The trick is not to be around when they go off.' Words to live by...",9,1,1,8 November 2011
