Marie Antoinette," Dull, vapid eye-candy
","While not the worst movie ever, as some on IMDb have labeled Marie Antoinette, it is not a good film in any sense.The film has some positives: beautiful clothes and settings. There is such a series of shots of gourmet cakes that it is almost pornographic. Part of the aim of the film might have been to display the excesses of Marie. The aim MIGHT have been anything - the only certainty is that the director missed.The movie's major flaw, is lack of a consistency - in message, goals and characters. While marketed towards teenage girls, the film meanders dreadfully. You couldn't care less what happens to the main character. She's beautiful, but that's it. Disconnected scenes, pointless drudgery.I suppose there are worse teenage girl flicks out there, however, most modern ones are a lot more amusing and honest. This is just another Hollywood example of big budgets with no attention to script or story line.Watch something else - anything else.",3,1,2,26 January 2008
