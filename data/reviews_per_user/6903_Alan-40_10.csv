The Blair Witch Project," Can you die from stupidity? Sure you can!
","Well, give credit where credit is due.  I think the acting was much better than the average review.  There was an authentic feel to it that was created in part by the acting, no matter how annoying the dialog was.  Also, even if you didn't like the movie, you have to admit it set a new standard for scare movies.  A sub-genre, if you will.For me, the suspension-of-disbelief aspect began to break down when the kids started avoiding the absolutely obvious way out of their predicament: follow the river!  Duh.  Wait a minute -- is it possible that the Blair witch was casting spells that were affecting their minds, ultimately ensnaring them in an evil web?  Nah!  Heather gave no evidence that she could ever find her ample butt with both hands, and her sidekicks weren't even running anything close to her speed.  Keeerist!  At least they're out of the gene pool now.Well, I'll give it 5-on-a-scale-of-10.  Aside from its shortcomings, it is a history-making film.",Null,0,1,30 October 2000
Erin Brockovich," Comes off as Lifetime-TV-for-Women movie but very very good
","Much better than I thought it would be.  Julia Roberts is almost always a good bet, which is a good thing for this movie because there is not a single scene in it without her in it.  You really can't help but root for her.",Null,0,1,28 March 2000
Bridget Jones's Diary," Hard to watch at points, but a great character.
","Talk about ditzy.  But you have to give her credit.  No matter how many lumps she takes (and boy does she take them, some deserved some not) she gets back up and is out slugging the next day for what she wants. She does flirt with quitting at one point, but doesn't.  You have to admire that, no matter how off-putting the smoking, drinking, and cussin' she does.  Not to mention the complete ineptness at executing any kind of real career.So how does she capture the attention, then devotion, of two upper-crust British men (one gentleman, one cad) who can and do have other women who are slinkier, richer, more poised, and quite willing?  You have to watch to find how Renée Zellweger somehow makes it work.  I do wish there had been fewer really really embarassing scenes for her to work through.For the record, the book is better.",8,0,0,24 April 2001
Pitch Black," Well done but disappointing
","As others has said, it ain't 'Alien.'  They missed a lot of opportunities in the story for the characters to develop.  The moral quandary of Fry just doesn't make it, nor does the boy turning out to be a girl in disguise.  The DVD cover quotes a review saying 'sexy' but this has to be one of the most sexless movies possible.  Still, it will keep the kids entertained.",Null,0,1,18 February 2001
Spirited Away," The story and the art are in the detail
","There are numerous and inevitable comparisons of Spirited Away and Alice in Wonderland but I think they all miss the mark. The vision that Hayho Miyazaki conjures up is so unique and quirky that many critics seem to reach for a comparison just to attempt to get their minds around what they have just seen. My view is such comparisons do disservice to both works.Chihiro is something of a tiresome brat at the beginning of the story, an easy place to start that everyone can recognize. (Already we have diverged from the story of Alice) It seems that only her diminutive size renders her appealing. She needs rescuing, but not from the forced relocation she deplores as you might think, but from her own ennui and, possibly, the unintentional neglect of her own parents. This is a situation that most children can recognize or relate to, even ones who were children decades ago as well as those too young to recognize what is going on.This is where much of the true art comes in, and what makes so worth watching. Chihiro becomes more real in each frame. Her story of growth is pieced together meticulously but with nearly unbreakable mortar. She starts out passive and rightfully afraid of nearly everything that is happening to her, but with believable resilience, some luck, and some help from odd strangers she graduates from simply enduring to actively engaging her challenges in a way that is truly inspiring.One of the most important aspects to the story is that once Chihiro is in the spirit world, she is treated like an adult. She may not be cherished at first (actually actively despised due to no fault of her own), but she wins the chance to sign an employment contract, an act not common to 10 year olds. Once she does, she has made her own place and is accepted. She still must deal with derision from most of the creatures who populate the world ('not for a human') and the unwelcome regard of her employer (sorceress Yu-Babba) but at least she finds a low rung on the social ladder. She must give up even her own name and take the name Sen, becoming someone else that must win Chihiro back, as well as the restoration of her parents.A key insight of the artwork lies in the fact that Kamajii, the spider-like boiler room attendant, Yu-Baaba and Zeniiba the twin sorceresses with way over-sized heads, and Bou, Yu-Baaba's gigantic baby, appear the way they do not because that is the the way an adult would see them, but the way a 10 year old girl might. Miyazaki-san has managed to reach back in his mind to see this, helped with his observations of a daughter of a friend who was about that age. An overbearing old woman's face would dominate the field of view of a girl as small as Chihiro, and the busy workman's arms would seem numerous and far reaching.One thread that I would have like to see played out more is the story of Lin, the hardworking and seemingly human girl who takes risks on Chihiro's behalf before she secures a contract, and then is delighted to take her as an apprentice, although she publicly hides it. ('Don't dump her on me!'). She is kind to Chihiro when she doesn't have to be, and looks after her. Rin has her own story that hasn't been told, in a respite moment she tells Chihiro that she wants to leave the bath-house where they work. Following Rin's lead most of the rest of the bath-house workers, who once despised all humans, are cheering for her to succeed. But Rin and Chihiro don't even get to say goodbye.Much has and will be written about the fantastic paintings come to life, and the incredible attention to detail that makes the movie more lifelike in many ways than a conventional reel would be. This is probably better experienced than discussed, but there is no flaw or fault in any frame that you can find. I am completely floored by critiques of this film that have anything bad to say about the animation  don't listen to them. You will only be cheating yourself; it does not get any better than this.Update: I got around to watching this again with the Japanese soundtrack, and as others have mentioned there are some fairly significant deviations between the Japanese and English versions of dialog. Further, the English subtitles to the Japanese track are not always perfect translations -- mostly pretty good. (When Chihiro says 'Hai!' it can mean, 'Yes,' 'Yes 'm,' or 'right.') Unlike some other reviewers I think the English version is in many ways superior. In many cases dialog is not dependent on lip-sync, and the American writers took advantage of this to interject some things that would otherwise be unclear. I would recommend everyone watch both versions.",10,2,3,27 December 2005
From Hell," Haunting and Moody
","Exploring the almost mythic story of Jack the Ripper, this movie gets your right down in the slums with the victims of the story. Depp's character is a bit hard to relate to because he spends a lot of time in a drug-induced haze, even though he is lucid enough while on the job. He'd be nowhere without the friendship of his sidekick played by Coltrane Perhaps the biggest problem with this movie is it is hard to see Inspector Abberline's (Depp) motivation to solve the murders, at least until he develops some interest in one of the potential victims, Mary Kelly (Heather Graham). Even then he seems so lightweight that he could just be blown away. An atypical hero.A very good choice for a weekend rental.",7,2,3,8 July 2005
Shrek," Much better than expected.
","What's not to like?  It's funny at all levels, both kids and adults will enjoy it.  It serves up the unexpected at several points, and Eddie Murphy is brilliant.The computer animation is better than just about anything I have seen to date.  One thing that is particularly impressive is how the they manage an incredible sense of scale -- when you see Faarquad's or the dragon's castle you get a definite sense of hugeness.  That's hard to achieve in any animation.  The dynamic resolution reveals stunning attention to detail.Definitely worth seeing.",Null,0,0,4 June 2001
The Sixth Sense," Must see
","I was most pleasantly surprised by Bruce Willis' understated performance here -- a much different type of hero than we are used to seeing with that name.  At the end he gets a victory that far surpasses the endless rubber-cement explosions that Hollywood seems to think we need. This is definitely a cerebral horror film that absolutely does not rely on special effects or gore to grip you.Amazing youngster, Haley Joel Osmet as well.  Other comments are right to point out he is better than most adult actors.  Also, I doubt any single mom could fail to fall in love with his mom, played by Toni Collette.Don't miss this.",Null,0,0,9 August 1999
Fantastic Four," Fantastic Snore
","If you are looking for anything beyond a bucketful of expensive-yet-unconvincing special effects, it certainly doesn't appear in this movie. The main actors are all good and hard working, but there is no reason to care about the characters they play. The ones that come closest to being meaningful are the bad guy Victor and the 'good' guy Ben, but in general each of the five (f4 and bad guy) have such trite, myopic, and annoyingly self-absorbed world views that any sympathy you can have for them is atrophied long before the first big boom in the movie.And just in case you are interested, don't go looking for any beguiling views of Jessica Alba in her form-fitting costume. The entire movie doesn't have even one. The 'romance' between her and her two suitors is so flat you would think Sue Storm has no sex appeal whatsoever. Overall, a waste of time and talent.",4,0,1,17 December 2005
The Island," Aims High and Misses  But Only a Little
","They bend lots of sheet metal, shatter lots of glass, and generally blow crap up in this one. However the writers were clearly trying for more than just an action flick. The action they got; the moral dilemma and the scientific speculation fall short in several areas.If you have to struggle at all with the right-or-wrongness of the idea that cloned humans have no rights and can be chopped up for spare body parts at the will of their 'sponsors,' then you have to be considered beyond this discussion. Go ahead and enjoy the movie; it will look to you like a futuristic 'Die Hard.' The bad guy does his best to present the devil's case here  that cloned humans are cattle because they wouldn't exist otherwise. But the arguments are so weak even his hired guns don't buy it. What should have been explored was the moral culpability of the huge number of people who were in on it, but without time in the screenplay it is boiled down to the single line 'humans will do anything to survive.' The creamy Scarlett Johansson is heartbreakingly attractive, only slightly less pretty than her leading man Ewan McGregor. Although their characters they look like adults they are actually 4 and 3 years old, respectively, and educated to 'the level of a 15 year old.' As a mere footnote to the story, somehow Lincoln Six Echo (McGregor's character) not only starts behaving beyond his environmental programming, but somehow acquiring the memories of the man he was cloned from. This could be built into a profound theological and legal question, but instead it is merely used to help Lincoln Six Echo operate in the outside world.What is left is still quite elaborate and interesting; just don't expect too much.",7,0,0,2 January 2006
