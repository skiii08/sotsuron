The Ring," lost
","What started off as a gripping creepy movie rapidly degenerated into a damp squid for me, perhaps it was too clever because i completely lost the plot towards the end and it finished with me thinking 'what the hell was all that about'Did i eventually work it out? well that would be telling, but it left me cold and let down and wondering why i bothered.The films only saviour was it's spooky locations, eerie soundtrack and good casting, the special effects were adequate but nothing to make you jump out of your seat and unfortunately, jumping out of your seat is what makes a good horror movie so i have no qualms about what will happen to me in seven days now i've seen the video.I'll grudgingly give this 5/10 for half entertaining me.",5,0,4,4 February 2006
