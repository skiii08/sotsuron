Hereditary," Good atmosphere, bad plot
","Above average for a horror movie, really immersive for the most part. The acting of the main cast is often over delivered. Plays out as a mystery where you try to figure out what is happening. The ending is extremely anti-climactic.",6,1,5,28 July 2019
What We Do in the Shadows," Tasteful, fun and creative
",Chockful of witty situational comedy and some slightly graphical gore scenes. Highly recommended,9,1,1,30 July 2019
