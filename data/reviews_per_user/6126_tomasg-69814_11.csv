Skyfall," The end of the beginning.....
","A JB movie alright. With some excellent acting and a good script. An opening scene that should get a ticket for kind of over-speed.And some last half an hour! Stays in your mind for weeks the first time you watch it.Danny's finest 007 hours on screen besides Casino, in my opinion. Some picks of humour delights the audience very well on the journey, and there's the right James Bond feeling most of the way.A Spanish guy named Javier Bardem is far out beautiful bad guy. (Can't remember a more stone cold avenging mind for decades in Bond time line....) When MI6 is forced to hide underground, you know it's red alert.One amazing scene after another, you can't catch breath for quite many seconds. The whole production team should have been awarded a 'small Oscar' for getting this together so brilliant. And the 'Put-aside-Spectre-story-for-a-while' works great. But it sleeps in the subs, if you know what I mean... But. I don't like the way Judy Dench (M) and 007 seems to have special feelings for each other. Blabla...I know. M never showed Pierce B that kind of sympathy!:/Church scene is kind of the ending of Return Of The Jedi; a fellow to me bringing that view. (Darth/Luke confession scene.) I don't think it suits a James Bond film...touching though, anyway.I rank this Daniel Craig James Bond 007 movie towards his other stuff. To Sean, Roger (R.I.P), George, Timothy, and Pierce's 007 stuff you got to have a distance kind of mind to enjoy them to the fullest.So I finish with my personal top 6 JB movies. (One from every actor's 007 career.)*SC: 'Goldfinger' (1964.) The 007-movies as we know them starts here. (For sure.)*GL: 'OHMSS' (1969.) Underrated one-show from George L. Entertaining and action-filled. A top 10 JB movie to me. Nevermind the aging of such 60's stuff.*RM: 'The Spy Who...' (1977.) Roger Moore as 007 to the fullest. A 70's classic people today still compares to year fellow movies like Star Wars, Close Encouters, or, for .... sake, Smokey and the Bandit. Way out there, as the 70's was, and a certain '79 movie sealed it.*TD: 'The Living Daylights' (1987.) Very hard to choose one of his (sadly only) two movies. I like both of them a lot. LTK gets to me deeper in between days, but this is more of the pure JB thing.*PB: 'Goldeneye' (1995.) All-in by Pierce Brosnan. He new his work was important and very well sought after. The other 007's of his sadly disappears in too much merchandise. And DAD is quite silly still, uh?*DC: 'Casino Royale' (2006.) No one could expected an entering like this. As his fore-runner, he knew that a first job was crucial. He did it, quite well.So...now I've completed my 007 reviews. Over 1,5 years since first. Got some likes, got some dislikes. (But I hope it entertains someone out there.)I adore you (Bond) movie lovers as much as you adore me, and any other kindred spirits!",7,5,7,8 July 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Surprisingly Fit And Enjoyable.
","Well, all you SW-fans out there. You got It. A well packed-in filler to discuss and analyze into eternity. Very nice effects, and a real well credible crew to enjoy on the journey. You get to know that without some hard-core rebels who were ready to go all-in, the Empire would still run the galaxy today... ;)During the show's evolution, you enjoy the details who gets you in the right gear for remembrance of a film that takes place before a flick that entered the cinemas in stone age 1977. Some levers, ships, weapons and clothing is very well recreated to get the right feeling.Key personalities from 'the past' shows up very moderate, but with good timing and at important occasions.It's not a wild guess that we have many more 'fill-in' SW-movies to expect in the future. (Already announced, uh?) The Disney factory got the dough for a dozen SW spin-offs for sure. But does the hard core SW-fans want it?While the usual series continues next year with Episode VIII, I got a bad feeling that too high expectations of a classic middle movie as 1980's Empire Strikes Back really can strike back on you.But I want to be proved wrong.",7,6,13,17 December 2016
Rocky IV," Truly mid-80's movie.
","Yeah!The Rock got to Russia, feeling that he had to be the good ambassador for the U.S. of A by avenge his friend Creed, who got his brain smashed in by a Soviet athlete in a show-match. (The myth of robot-like Russian was in full bloom by the time; the Soviet hockey team destroyed everything in their way through the whole 80's, with very few exceptions.)This artificial movie is somehow entertaining, by all means. Very well packed in, with the whole mid 80's feeling you got watching this flick today. Some quite good acting is sometimes messed up by the silliness of over-exposed clothing and car brands. (Yes, I know.....nothing has changed 30 years later.) Once an actor superstar was wearing something on screen, people rushed to the stores for getting that flashy, important feeling of self awareness by getting those aviator jackets and Adidas clothes.The movie itself smells quite bad of patriotism and propaganda. You know: The land of the Free, vs communist Russia. (The doubtful American actor president of Ronnie Reagan negotiated hard by this time with Russian political chief Gorbatjov, to keep the force measurement of both countries low, on a chill.)Well, but the movie sometimes got it's effective moments. The training camp scenes in Russia really gets to you, and the struggle of knowing that you got to fight for your life is very well reflected in Stallone's acting.Swedish actor Dolph Lundgren was to always being associated to this movie. Going on making B rated action movies through the rest of the 80's and into the 90's, people just remember him as Ivan Drago. The tool which should show the world of the supremacy of the Russian system.But, as we all know....they failed. Of course Midget Sly finally brought Tower Dolph down to his knees, and as a bonus got saluted by the Russian audience.Fly me to the moon....",5,0,3,15 July 2016
Quantum of Solace," Some Disappointment.
","This 'Casino Royale Pt. II' could have been so great. So great. The promising opening scene was a real roaring and loaded one, when you watched it on the big screen at the premiere. This gonna turn out good, I remember saying to myself after some 10-15 minutes into the show.Then the interest faded fast, and the story got striking dull to me. It turned out to a common action-movie with less Bond-feeling than it's precursor. The chase after a major crime syndicate that started in CR, suddenly wasn't that interesting anymore. A clip-show of action packed scenes that was suppose to keep you engaged, doesn't do it. Much violence. Very much violence. The producers defended it with Bond's strong will to avenge Vesper Lynd's death, but I think that failed. The producers seemed to have packed in some 80 m $ more than CR, for nothing. (Total cost of some 230 m $, I've read.) The movie is overall quite good, but has too many lacks. The cast is good, the environments is nice, but the real, solid 007-feeling isn't just there.The women who passes by are just for looks; best of them is beautiful Gemma Arterton, who plays her part for some laughs, as I see it. Easy going, with humor. The main Bond Girl of the movie (played by Olga Kurylenko) is quite flat, as the usual 'Pleasure Girl Who Has Been Kept Imprisoned By Villain'. She is on her own vendetta journey and crosses Bond's way on the road.Jesper Christensen's Mr. White was to be developed further on. A well played personality by a professional actor. Jeffery Wright's Felix Leiter of the CIA delivers a good touch to the movie, too.The somehow main story (of water supplies for an exposed Latin country) is the most important sub-message of this film. Policy makers who wants control over the helpless masses. The end is a lecture of what's rightfully comes to you when you're too evil minded...This is not one of the greatest James Bond movies. Shortest running time of them all (106 minutes) which suits this movie good. It's not standing out as a true classic like Goldfinger, OHMSS, For Your Eyes Only, Goldeneye, or it's mate movie Casino Royale.But it's a part of the 007 movie log all right, and deserve to be watched even in the future. Next up was a major improvement, some four years away. Too far away, back then.",6,0,3,19 March 2016
Rocky," One Of A Kind.
","I guess there's A lot of people born in the 80's or 90's taking this for a poor 70's movie. Slow, boring, and dull.Filmed in a semi-documentary way by the director to get that 'street-feeling', it's really a great move. Today not many people can't stand to see a movie filmed in a 'handy- cam' way...)Re-visit - for an example - 'French Connection' (1971.)Younger watcher's of Sylvester Stallone by his so called youth can't believe their eyes, but for god's sake: Do It!!Here is pure and good acting, from a guy that was almost broke and finished in the business he once choose to enter, in then 1975.Made up A boxer's story his way and made it work all the way to an Academy Award.The company did not had high hopes and gave away just a strict 1 M$ (same as the 1st James Bond movie 14 years earlier) in production costs.)You can clearly see the fails and the flaws of a 70's movie, but that's the charming parts of it. The whole cast crew gives their most to make you believe it, and you do that. The steps Sly takes on the way to the final confrontation is very heartful and moving, which of course was the attention.Fellow actors Burt Young and Talia Shire is excellent all the way.Accused for stealing a concept from a real heavy-weight fight in 1975, Stallone always denies the Ali-Wepner comparison. (The difference of Rocky almost punch movie champion to the floor; the latter being saved by the bell and then pronounced as the winner by judge decision.)Real boxer Chuck Wepner gave Ali a real deal to handle, referee didn't blow the whistle until a few seconds left of the 14th.(?) (Correct me please...)All in all a great 'feeling' movie.Carl Wheaters is going punch you hard if you disagree!A beautiful 70's movie; you like it... or you're not.",8,2,2,28 April 2017
Rocky III," Remember the amazing 80's.....
","As artificial as film boxing can be, it peaked here. Yes, the IV fight with Dolph Lundgren (Ivan Drago ) is as incredible as these RIII fights. No, the strength of the Rocky sequels is not the boxing, it's in the struggle with personal life, and the before-and-after fight scenes, that Stallone lifts up his Rocky Balboa with some good acting sometimes. But he obviously thought that the audience wanted an always coming back-machine, who securely would punch out an 8 feet alien monster if he just gets 'mad enough', in Paulie's words.No, I think the balance in this movie is brought by Carl Weathers, who's Apollo Creed gets nice to his former antagonist, and wants the newcomer Clubber Lang (well played by Laurence Tureaud/Mr. T) to smell the floor, and therefore puts his skills into slugger Rocky, and gets a rough piece of rock into a sharp diamond, but of course not without some motivation trouble on the way....Well, back in -82 this was surely a smash hit at the cinemas, but the Rocky series was sadly turned into too much way-out fiction. The fights of the two first movies are nice, the one in Rocky II has some very good choreography and directing, and the same last man standing sense that of the first. But after a bad episode V in 1990, Stallone waited 16 years and gave us some little more realism in the Rocky Balboa of 2006. Thank you for that, Sly.",5,1,2,19 December 2015
Jaws," Just True Classic.
","Thanks Steven Spielberg, that you found the way out of the complete storm the making of this movie was. All you movie-fans already know the story, and I just want to share my profits of It. The unique mind of a shoot that Spielberg holds, make him one of the greatest in my opinion. (OK, the whole team behind him should be applauded too, for getting this together.) It still stands out, as 40 year old piece of film, and matures continuously like a fine wine. Still watching It from time to time, one can always find new angles to enjoy. Born this summer, I never saw it fresh, of course. But I can imagine the hype it represented 1975. Nevermind the fake shark's failures, or the sometimes deficient facts of the script, the luck of the casting is what really stands out. Without the grumpy Robert Shaw it would have been a complete different movie. Without Richard Dreyfuss as the logical, sensitive marine Biologist it would not be the same, too. Roy Schreider's sheriff of the Amity Island struggles with both family and the city community for keeping the people 'out of water'. You can easily find extracts of yourself in all of the three men: Stubborness, fear, insecurity, resignation and anger. That is why I like this movie so much. Watch it with Brody's eyes, next time with Quint's. The other next time with Hooper's. And another time with the Mayor's? Just never, ever buy the fact of some kind of a smart shark. Because it will ruin the experience of this classic 'sea-thriller.'",9,2,4,5 December 2015
Casino Royale," Most Impressive Debutant.
","He was a real trump in the 007 history, the good Daniel Craig. Not too many people had high hopes when revealed who was the next in line to be transfigured to one James Bond.Neither did I. Mostly because of my lack of experience according to Craig; saw him in 'Munich' and some other stuff, but never studied him closely. (Common people was skeptical about a blond Bond too; all right....)This is maybe my all time favorite 007 movie. I was delighted when leaving the cinemas after the premiere; some decade later I still watch it as Daniel Craig's sensational debut, and (so far) best performance. Nowadays, this movie has the taste of a fine, tasty and well matured wine. (You might reference to Pierce B's 'Goldeneye', from which I got the same feeling.) The new-thinking freshness - who was necessary after Brosnans way too flashy exit - of digging up the 'old' Royale story and make something decent of it, was ingenious. James Bond Mk. VI. But from the so called beginning. Confusing? During the Craig years, occasionally I've had hard times not to refer to the Bond movies past, and it's time lines.A 'Back To The Future' state of mind not needed here, that's for sure!!Formidable casting and a script that hardly sleeps. We got action from the very beginning - true classic opening scene! - and a very good chemistry between newcomer Craig and since long M of Dame Judy Dench. The catchy, smart and suggestive theme song who has great gravity, is a nice take-off for what to come during the show.Double-crossing, love, betrayal and greed. All the well needed ingredients for a James Bond movie is there. For many fans of the series, Eva Green stands out as the all time favorite female act. (Maybe not mine, but there's always split sentences about everything.)Otherwise, the cars is there. The charismatic villain. The supporting act from one Felix Leiter. Elements just all right - and enjoyable - for completion. When the curtain fell after the final scene, Daniel Craig now really was Bond. James Bond.",9,2,6,18 March 2016
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," 40 of age and still enjoyable.
","George Lucas was exhausted - and had lost several pounds - when his finished work finally was to be shown to the public officially on the big screen.The recordings had been very troublesome, and was on a budget shoestring until the end. (Did it stop at 11 M $ ?) In 1977 the movie landscape was very well mixed, but It lacked Space Adventures who was far out there.Spielberg's 'Close Encounter' from the same year did not speculate in fantasy as deep as Lucas' adventure; here we got a whole table of pure imagination and creativity from a guy who just wanted to show us the eternal battle between good and bad, dark and light, his way.And by 1977's standards and special effects options of the era: What an enjoyable classic!It's an adventure who has a good mood from start to finish. Great locations, great humour, great acting.Don't want to cherish the old trilogy in front of the 'sequels', but it brings heck a lot more charming and warm feeling re-seeing those 77- 83 flicks.I leave it that way......'Star Wars' is probably one of the 10 most important movies of the 20th century.",8,5,6,28 October 2017
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Famous second.
","Well, so many things had been written through the years about this. Gonna keep it moderate.Yes, the Star Wars Saga matured A LOT with this movie. They tossed away most of the naivety and let the grown up people be just that. Grown Ups.Farm boy Skywalker comes of age, starting to be aware of his legacy. Two other fellas has to admit they're in love. The androids and robots keeps entertain. The dark lord shows some of his single pennies of humanity. Environments developed to great treat for the audience. (For example the impressive Cloud City takes; still watchable 36 years later.)I still like the first three (quite oldish) movies in the series much better than the following. In my opinion, SW founder G. Lucas waited way too long with the sequels. He once said - I've read - that he waited for screen special effects to be developed for translating his visions just right.(Personally I think that's bulls**t; he simply wasn't all clear of what way to turn in the story, even if he supposedly had some 'present' and 'future' ideas.) If the 'Episode I' had been written and filmed in, let's say, around 1988-89, with the crew still kind of fresh from '....Jedi', we would have been presented a whole different movie, not having that heavy political theme of the -'99 flick, I think. (The story of senator/future emperor Palpatine - Ian McDiarmid - is a rip-off from history anyway....slowly building up his ascendancy like the way a well known German did in the 1930's.)And the SW fans of the 70's and 80's (like me) would have felt a more close connection to the originals, rather than having the jump of 16 years.Anyone agree?",8,1,3,15 July 2016
Spectre," There's A Bond for every Era.....
","Daniel Craig's last (?) Bond closed up well. SPECTRE is a good, modern Bond-movie as we write 2015. My chronological Bond-brain always put bugs in my mind; I often match the individual eras of 007 with the present; BAD. But that's me; I maybe think too much... You must put aside the past as much as you can to get full enjoyment of this darn good show. Remembering the old, I want to front hold the development of directing. (And of course, the special effects facilities.)Sean Connery did a great bunch of Bond's in the 60's; founded it all, and George Lazenby did an underrated single performance. Roger Moore was the gadget era, which somebody will remember him by. But I personally think he filled his cup in the Bond era. Timothy Dalton was a stage performer at first, who did the Bond of the novels I've read a couple of times. Two great films. Pierce Brosnan did a great first performance, the rest of his movies lacks of good 007-spirit; mostly commercial subscripts and some half-ass performances of the casts. Daniel Craig is so far a 007 of is age. The decade since his arrival has been enjoyable!WILL JAMES BOND RETURN?",6,1,3,4 December 2015
