Despicable Me 2," definitely worth seeing - as good as the first one
","i just came back from cinema and have to say that it was great, fast, funny, full of jokes for audience of all ages, although storyline has a lot of secondary threads it lacks some major twist that could make you say 'i did not saw that coming', but then again it is aimed at audience that expects fun and not mind bending storiesit does have some moments that are a bit scary for 5 year old so make sure that your young one remembers that it is only a story and it will end well (which of course is true)like in the first part there are some bloopers at the end so don't leave too quickly",9,32,60,22 June 2013
