The Blair Witch Project," Make sure you see it with friends!
","I guess i'm not sophisticated enough for this flick.  I just didn't 'get it'.  I still enjoyed the heck out of it for its comedy. Talk about over hyping.  What was so scary about this movie for people? The scariest part was <spoiler alert!> the snot running out of the girl's nose in her 'I'm so scared!' speech.  My father and I were dazzled by the craftmanship of the witches.  Those were the scariest twigs I had ever seen. Oh and those stacks of rocks were great, too.  Oh wait, i'm focusing too much on the 'special effects' and not the psychological aspects of the movie.  Great plot set up.  There was this witch right, back in the olden days, and it has something to do with some guy coming out of the woods, and some children, too. Its a great Mystery Science Theatre candidate.  Make sure and watch it with your friends and a bunch of beer.",1,0,1,27 October 1999
