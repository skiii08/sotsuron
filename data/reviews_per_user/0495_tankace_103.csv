Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Less killing than the first but still nice.
","Kill Bill Volume 2 follows the Bride to its last target of her death list and although this movie lacks the killing spree of the first its dialogue and performance are great and we also learn here about her back story, why the Assassin Viper Squad tried to kill her and her relationship with Bill (it was more intimate than I though).In general the movie close all the lose ends than the previous had left as well as giving us with a good way the identity of the Bride ,which was a secret during the Volume 1. So when the movie ends the story is practically 100% finished and I believe that Tarantino tried to do just that, made a two part movie,now the why I don't have any idea, but as the third movie in a franchise is usually the worst and some times destroys the story of the previous two, see for instance Spiderman 3, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines Matrix Revolution and X-men the Last Stand, I think he made a good choice. In the Volume 1 the love of Quentine for the Japanese culture and the samurai sword was obvious ,for Christ sake about 65% of the movie takes place in Japan! In this one we see his love for the martial ,but we also have some nit picks of western ,like a sunrise and some more (No spoilers!). I generally like the on equal measure this two flicks, for are really cool and tell a story ark of an kick ass female assassin ,which isn't the norm as we have see in leads role women in a handful of action films, like the Alien and Aliens, Terminator, Terminator 2: Judgement Day and Mad Max: Fury Road. In summary for the girls ,who want to show to men that they can be lethal, you can add and the two Volumes in your collection.In short is a really good Tarantino film as it is usual with is director ,who is among the greatest of the last two decades.",8,6,9,4 July 2016
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A disgrace to the saga
","In honor of the fourth of May ,the official Star Wars day I will start reviewing the prequels, ow boy this going to be ruff. Nowadays is easy to see how bad the Phantom Menance is but when it first came out, it was 16 years after a Star Wars movie was in the big scene, so everyone old Force users and young links were exacted for the continuation of this epic saga. Then they saw the flick and the backlash was an epic one and rightfully so. In case and point, the cgi are ugly to put it polite, the majority of the characters are either racist stereotypes like Jar Jar Bing (curse to be!) ,boring like Padme Amidala or both and for the case of the Jedi council ,which is useless, I mean a PLANET is under foreign occupation by one of senate members and they just do nothing. Why? You are consider to be the protector of the Galaxit Rebuplic and you have the Force. Understood if you can not sent the whole Jedi membership ,but sent at least more than two people when the situation goes to hell. To add to that the battle of Naboo is a CGI mess,they tried to do again the battle of Endor, and we get a CGI mess and a boring (if that is possible) Space Battle, in Star Wars!! The only good things are Liam Neeson performance, the pod racing and Darth Maul, this three small bits proved the Menance to become unwatchable. I do not recommended for any reason ,but to see how underwhelming it is.",6,0,2,4 May 2016
The Hangover," This how R-rated comedies should be
","Hangover is a great comedy for a number of reasons.Firstly its story is original ,but understandable at the same time: four friends have a bachelor party in Las Vegas and the next morning have no idea what happen, how and why. A simple story,in a comedy, is great because you can add on it whatever you like and it will ,still, work.Secondary the majority of the characters that our protagonists meet ,are either likable or hilariously over the top. Third and last the jokes are at times quit cruel and when someone react ,in that crazy situation, he or she starts cursing, which is logical if you think what has happen and in the duration of a single night!! To be more analytical, the last part is were the R-rated comes and gives the felling of realism ,be honest here even the most calm person you know ,found himself( lets be real girls' hangovers are boring) in such a situation, he would in hulk mud for a long time. In a sense Hangover is masculine comedy with the proper humour.The only problem that, this movie has is its sequel, those movies ,which should not exist at the first place,overload this open and shot case with out any good reason apart from the studio make more money, in other words the usual weakness of the comedy and horror genres, after a great movie came out unnecessary sequels and bad imitators. In the end, I really like this movie and if you are a man , it should be in your favorites comedies.",9,1,2,17 April 2016
Iron Man 3," MCU Christmas Special.
","From the title is obvious that the movie take place during the Christmas period. Anyway Iron Man 3 though not on par with the first film in the trilogy ,is still a quit entertaining yet overrated movie at the same time. So why is that?Firstly up to today (2016 September) is the highest grossing solo superhero movie of all time making 1,215 billion $ and Robert won the People's Choice awards for the best Action Hero of the year and in general the movie won and get nominated on several awards. And yes the story is quit interesting, the effects are amazing and Ben Kingley was a mega troll move on the director part. Though not many liked this interpretation of the Mandarin this troll move was really funny to say the truth. Those are the pros of the flick.Now to the cons: it has a strange pacing and at times it feels either too fast or too slow, and the second revelation about our lead villain was a bit dumb and didn't make a lot of sense to me at least. Now it is common knowledge that the MCU movies are lacking in making good villains with the exception of the fan-favorite Loki and her is the same story ,different melody. And now to the box office, I find it too much that the movie grossed more than the two previous Iron Man together and this is due to three things.One the Iron Man Logo sells big, two it is a closing chapter to the first Marvel Cinematic Universe Avenger (not in the time- line of the series, but of the release of the movies) and three and final as a Christmas movie it is among my favorites along side Die Hard, It is a Wonderful Life and Homw Alone. All in all the Iron Man trilogy isn't one of the best and with only the first movie being praised by everyone and the two sequel being OK and good closure respectively.",8,0,1,22 September 2016
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Historical action flick!
","Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark is among the most celebrated and loved action movies in cinema history. It is one of the game changers of the action genre for with that film the running man became popular with many movies adapting this formula. Also the flick catapult the career of Harrison Ford in to legend and not with out reason. The movie is centered to the quest of professor Jones to discover the Lost Ark ,which contains the ten commandments, it rumored that if someone get them he or she will get immense power. So professor must find it before the Nazis seize it and God knows what they are willing to do with it. The plot is great and this is the MOVIE with which national socialists (they know nothing about socialism) the go to villains if you wanted to make the antagonist hated and kill him with awesome ways. I have no issue with that for see these criminals of war taking a dose of their one medicine is liberating.To the music ,just iconic and anyone alive has sing it at least ones per year ,it is so in our culture that even today kids under fifteen knows it! What do you expect John Williams made the music and he is also the master mind in music for some other project you may ,dear reader know. Between them are: Star Wars, Jaws , Schindler's List, Jurassic Park, Saving Private Ryan , Harry Potter, Born on the fourth of July, just name of few!! In short his music rocks and the movie rocks.Also the quotes , the scenes have let a lasting impression to the world and the recognition which has the movie took is totally ,100% justified. Highly recommended to anyone alive and breathing.",9,0,0,3 July 2016
Unbreakable," Superhero movie origin story and without knowing it.
","M. Night Shyamalan has become one of the most hated directors and writers in modern movie history and I am agree with that. For equilibrium sake he took Avatar and took out everything that made the series so good, also After Earth and Happening .Yes, as it seems apart from Wayward Pines in which luckily he has the secondary role of executive producer ,his career has gone down hill ,but in the turn of the century and early two thousands he made some very good films , like my personal best Unbreakable.The film came out in 2000 just when superhero flick were making a come back after Batman and Robin (muxc) and Steel and unfortunately was overlooked by critics, although went very well to the box office. To the story, it centers between two characters, David (Bruce Willis) who after an accident ,from which he is the only survivor and he hasn't even a scats(!) starts investigating why that happened and he meets Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) an artist opposed with comic books, who insist that Dave is a superhero.We see the dynamic among those persons be extended to David family and the fall out come after ,bonus Robin Wright and Spencer Treat Clark who played respectively the wife and son of David are fantastic and I was surprised more with Clark who was only thirteen years old back then. His performance is only shadowed by Samuel L. Jackson, who as usually steals the show not with extreme action and awesome quotes but by been so grounded and calm that at times you think that his bones are indeed so fragile as he say.If this flick came out today everyone would loved it and it would be praised for its originality and realistic tone. But sadly it saw the light of day the period before X-men and Spiderman when the audience had lost faith to the capes and cowls. One more fact that the critics did not speak for it, was that its ending (twist of course we talk about Shymalan here) lack the impacted of the Six Sense and immediately the shoot it for that, even though in the story fits like a glove.So go see it if you have not already, if you are comic geek like me then you will praise it after words.",9,0,1,24 June 2016
Fury," Better than I though.
","When I show that Brad Pitt and Shia LaBeouf were in the cast in though 'the flick would be awful' ,'you put the homeless man and the idiot of the Tranformers together!', 'What the *beep* are you thinking'. After words I watched the flick and I though 'Either I am too harsh to LaBouf and Pitt or they know to act well, but they like to mess with the audiences' ,that are my ideas about those guys!To the main story ,we follow a crew of a tank named 'Fury' after the Operation Overlord and we watch as these guys go on a mission in order to destroy as many Nazis as possible. The flick more than deserve its 'R' rating for this has gore, curse and the general brutality that defies War. For disclaimers isn't better than Saving Private Ryan, but it doesn't try to be , it is a good War world 2 movie and if I should which WW2 film copies, that is Das Boot, but it is more that has similarities with it rather than a rip-off.To the performances ,amazing, everyone plays great their role and the commitment to the project was apparent. It said that LaBouf to be in his role he didn't was during filming and he stinted show bad that the rest of the actors couldn't be near him for long! OK that is crazy and the guy must have some issues ,but at least he showed acting skills for ones after the Tranformers apart from Lawless. Also it is in my one of the best WW2 movies after the turn of the century (But lest be honest the Pianist (2002) and Der Untergang (2004) are the best!).In any way you see it is a good War movie with great action, a fine story and characters you care about. It isn't a masterpiece , but at least is really well made and definitely you should watch it if you love WW2 flicks like me.",8,3,6,11 July 2016
Citizen Kane," Landmark of the film Industry
","Going all the way back in to nineteen forty-one and reviewing after finally watching Citizen Kane is an interesting experience to say the least. Also this two hours film in a few years is going to be eighty years old, so watching it and now reviewing it is like time-traveling and been a Whovian to the core I can't but feel goosebumps.So the film is centered to a group of journalist who try to find out what the final words of a publishing tycoon Kane meant. During their visiting we get by numerous a persons, friends, adversaries, once loved ones to him who was Kane. Everone is giving us a different take, others say that he was a annoying arrogant fraud, some a brilliant entrepreneur, others a bossy and authoritarian figure. During these interviews and read we see flashbacks of his life and how his people next to him perceive him. In other words we don't take the same portrait from two different people for Mr. Kane, this is also true in life, for one a man maybe funny and quit interesting, while someone else is going to find him a obnoxious A-hole, you can be liked to anyone I guess.One thing which struck me about the film is that it begun with a about ten minute montage of Kane's life, in short Orson Welles spoils the events from the get go. But after-wards what we get is the point of view of these events from the people who were doing them , but never from Kane himself ,which is ironic having the title character not been the central character. In truth Kane is the key of the plot and the plot is...wait for it... who was he really? If you had to summarizes the whole movie it comes to that who was he, a hero, a scum, an over-ambitious man, it is in the end up to the viewer to decide who he could judge him. This why I believe that this film has become one of the classics, it is a case study of the life of a man from his start to his final days and after-wards the people around him ,the pre-mentioned friends, adversaries, loved ones and added to them the press are going to give their point of view about him. In other words we are the protagonist of our own movie, which is our life (!), the audience and the critics the persons surrounding us who will give their own grade to that matter from 10/10 to 0/10.All in all it was a great character study and if you are interested in psychology, sociology or public relationships you have to give it a watch.",9,1,3,25 April 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Give your code name :' Rogue One'
","So there we have a Star Wars PREQUEL, as we all know the prequels are at best boring and at the worst case scenario a disgrace to the name Star Wars. Thanks to Yoda ,the Force was strong with this one and it definitely deliver us with the best prequel in the Galaxy's Far Far way history. The story is as it follows, the Rebellion takes word of a new weapon been produced by the Empire (the first Death Star) and so an operation takes places in order to find out what it is and how to send to hell.That is more or less the story and let's be honest the whole film it is a set up for Episode IV. But it is made in such way that it makes the 1977 film even better for now you get what has happen in order for this plans to be delivered in to the Alliance hands. As for the character development, was as bit sloppy and made in a harry ,but the manage to do the needed minimum , for the audience to care for our character and it was done quite well. All the actors did their best and now to the good stuff: the effects and battle-scenes.One word ,mindblown, beautifully made, excellent mix of computer generated and practical to the point that you at times couldn't tell the difference. As for the fighting... goodness this was what we wanted needed and then some from the fight on the ground to the space battles ,it feel like watch a WW2 movie by in space. That is a compliment and quit fitting to this universe for when the first movie's space battles were made Lucas took inspiration from the air-combat in WW2, so that is a nice node to the original and the biggest war in human history.All in all forget Christmas, now we celebrate Star Wars. Recommended to any Star Wars fun and may the force be with you force users. Happy celebration to all.",9,3,8,21 December 2016
Iron Man 2," Sequels don't always cut it.
","Iron Man 2 is not on part with the first movie, not even close ,if anything this is the worst movie of the MCU as yet. The main reason for the decrease in quality from the Iron Man, is that Iron Man 2 is by default a filler,though quit an expensive one (it had a budget of 200 million, 60 million more than the first movie), but filler none the less which exist only to introduce S.H.I.E.L.D. and Black Widow in to the MCU and set the stage for the Avengers.Not that I am complaining for any of this things (:p), what can I say I am only human. So what is good with it?First the new actor who plays Rhodey Rhodes is really good and I buy why he and Tony are best friends, Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts is decent on her role, but the person who steal the show are Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury(one of the best casting ever) and Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, the role that made her in to the A-list actress she is today. For real why anyone in six years after this flick hasn't made a movie with her in the lead role?Second the action scenes are well executed and the CGI are great and don't disappoint either.Now the main drawbacks from the film: One the villain is just there in order for Iron Man to have someone to fight. Two the movie's plot is slow and though it is only two hours and five minutes long it feels much longer. Third and final is the man himself (Not Stan Lee) Tony , whose character doesn't change from the whole situation, to be honest after the first Iron Man ,his character will remain mostly the same up to Civil War eight years and five movies later.In the end Iron Man 2 is an enjoyable movie with good action and a mostly functional plot. An the fact that is the worst for what the Marvel Studio has gave us or among the worst if you include Thor and Thor the Dark World.,which aren't also bad, just not the best, is a sign that this one of the best Franchices in history.",7,0,1,21 September 2016
12 Monkeys," Monty Pythons writer+ time travel+ Apocalypse= weird but good!
","12 Monkeys is one of the most interesting and weird movies, I have ever seen. Anything from its designs ,costume and setting are unique and I am unable to say for sure from where Terry Gilliam took inspiration. What did you expect he is one of the writers of the Monty Pythons movies ,so such a surrealism in the movie ,it should be expected! So the movie is no doubt a good one and it has the rare distinction to be a good non-linear flick. Just for the record that kind of flick has a confusing story, the editing is made in a non-linear way and at times you find yourself question what the hell is happening. And that method has become famous by Quentin Tarantino.And sadly this method though quit interesting, has some major drawbacks: 1) It is difficult 2) You have to know when and where to do it That is the reason why few directors use it. Just take the movie Alexander , which is a complete mess ,honesty I have no idea what was he thinking.And here we go: In 1996 (keep in my the movie came out in 1995) a man- made virus emerge and devastates the human population forcing us to go under ground in order to survive. So about forty years after a operation is organized and gives to some convicts a choice, if they travel through time in order to gather evidence for the virus for the science team to create an antidote for this virus, they will be pardoned! One of the volunteers is James Cole, played by Bruce Willis, and he is the main character and for this movie the point of view character and this mission ,although it sounds pretty straight forward, there is very important issue with the time travel business: Time traveling has the major side effect , it mess with your perception of reality and we can clearly seeing to Cole's case .This breaking of the understanding of what is real is seen by the fact Cole is seeing and hear things that doesn't add up and the fact that at times his story line is anything but linear, for he is in one point of time and in other in the next scene makes for a surreal experience ,which at times makes you question ,who must reliable is your POV character, for even though it is clear that time travel creates issues, so much craziness seems a bit extreme! And that is great this gives one for the main themes our relationship with technology, which on the one hand helps us find solution (time traveling) ,but on the other the virus was artificial!Also an other theme that come in to view with so much time hopping the memories of Cole can they be real or he for real nuts, it is open to you to decide and whatever you think ,you may right,wrong or both ;)! In short in a world that has sane people act like idiots and the, so called, crazy give logical expansions for what is happening ,how could we be sure for what we think ,is made for logical conclusions or we have lost it? That question is made by Brad Pitt's character Jeffrey Goines for that times (literally) he seems be totally mad and what he says makes sense and when we see him 'be sane he sounds and moves with no connection to the reality! In general the movie give zero care to say an linear story or make any real sense of what is happening, but it try to make you question all of the above ,with some time traveling throw in to the mix ,just to confuse you even more! And here is the broken part, the fact that you can't not make sense what is happening and the nut job character you meet don't help either. That ambiguity makes the flick awesome for philosophical questions like those above can be made, but they have to fit to the story and here they do very well.In short if you want to play smart to the hipsters,cine snubs that think they are smart then watch that movie and used mad clews in order to break their little pathetic ideals to the iceberg of the Titanic! Have a good it and if you don't understand it the first time, its OK I deed it to watch two times in a weekend to get it and then read some analyses for that! So don't feel that the film wants to make you feel stupid, it wants to make you fear confused, confused?",8,1,2,21 July 2016
Rocky V," What happened ?
","Rocky 5 is by far the worst in the Rocky film series and with good reason .I don't have the slightest idea who this movie failed show bad, but I will now give it a try, write below if you agree or not with me what you think and I could add ,but I forgot to do it. To start Rocky is not even the main character of the story here, which is not right if you that the movie is called ROCKY 5. Also it shows us stereotypical behavior of everyone playing in this movie and the way all this is played out is just awful and boring. Finally the new boxer is nothing more of a scum, there you could tell me that Rocky did stark as a middle man for load shark ,but he did it out of necessity not choice and after his win he want just to be with his loved ones. It is a bit funny that with the end of Cold War ended also for many year this Francaise also.",4,0,0,20 March 2016
Elizabeth," Becoming one of the most historic women in the global history
","Elisabeth is the biography of Elisabeth the first of England who is credited often of starting the process of making Britain one of the strongest biggest and most advanced empires of the whole time, so the film had a lot to do. The final result is a well made depiction of the early days of our protagonist from a seclusive girl to the monarch of a renaissance kingdom.The idea to so the process of this transformation was a quit smart one as the majority of history buffs know what took place during her reign from the built up of the navy, to the final establishment of the English Church and the explosion of art in the Fair Isles but few have a good knowledge of the person behind all that. And the film does portrait the political game of the fifteenth century very well, with some dramatization and simplification here and there in order for the common viewer to keep track of the event ,but with out losing the essence of the story.As for the queen herself, Cate Blanchett gave a great performance of the character and she showed very well how difficult and at times heartbreaking was for her to adapt to a court divided in which who you like and who you trust doesn't always mean the same person. Also thankfully she didn't become a cry-baby during all the events of the film, rather her pain was shown much more esoteric and damaging her psychology than her in a psychical term.To the setting ,costume and personalities we have excellent to the first two and a little mixed of dramatization ,but not to a point that was more fiction than fact like some else, (Brave-heart, The Patriot, Apocalypto ).In the end a good historical film ,if you are a history buff go watch you will like it ,for the rest ,just give it a try.",8,0,0,4 April 2017
Oldboy," De-Sou I pity you!!
","Oldboy (not the 2013 ,the original) is striking example of an cult action film and even now, it is praised for its acting, action scenes and story which has one of the most shocking plot twist in film history. So it is time to cut my teeth to this little gem.In short the story follows De-Sou ,a worker who in 1988 is kidnapped and he is held for 15 years and after wards he is released and now he tries to find out who held him and secondary after why for his antagonist Lee Woo-Jin (great villain) forces him in order to finish his 'game' with him. At the same he befriends a young chief Mi-do ,with who they get on with on the bed (---) if you have seen the film you know what is coming. Also we see some of the most intense and brutal action scenes in history, especially the hallway , wow my it was brutally awesome.AND now the plot twist, if you don't know it skip this paragraph. Lee reveals that he hypnotize De-Sou and his daughter ,who is actually Mi-Do ,in order for them to get close ,so he knows how feels like when you lose someone close ,as Leee was so close with his sister,when he and De-Sou were classmates in school. That practically breaks De-Sou and makes Lee the winner of this sick 'game' , so De-Sou cuts his tongue as a show to Lee in order to keep that secret ,between the two. After that Lee, commits suicide because he realized that his revenge can't bring his sister back from the dead. In the end De-Sou 'ask' the doctor how messed with his head to erase his memory as for him to live in peace with Mi-do. As if this last hypnotism worked it is up to you.All in all Oldboy is neat, brutal ,awesome and traumatic neo-noir and it is recommended for crime-seekers everywhere. But if you are unable to deal with violence, that kind of mystery and plot twists ,it is better to pass this one. BUT don't what the Spike Lee remake for it is awful and boring as hell.",9,1,3,22 December 2016
Batman Returns," Batman gets the Burton treatment.
","Batman Returns is the sequel to the original 1989 film and because the previous film made almost twelve times its budget ,making one of the highest grossing movie of 1989, Warner Brothers gave to Burton free range to make the movie as he liked to. And here is why the movie has issues for Burton is a really good director in creating strange characters out of some idea and give it a Gothic beautiful style. But in adapting a character of a already existing source isn't his strongest suit and Alice in Wonderland is proof to that! Despite that I will say that it is a fine movie.So to anyone who has see it that is the reason why the Gothic and funny elements of the first film were cracked to eleven in this one. Now to the story it follows the new criminal called Penguin ,played by Dany Devito, who using black mailing tactics and allying with a corrupt business man ,play by Christofer Walker(!) of all people device a plan in order to take over Gotham and Batman has to (of course )stop them. While this plot is happening we also take the origin story of one of the most well known and loved( By men mostly ;)) anti-heroines of all times and main love interest of the Dark Knight ,Catwoman. Now Michelle Pfeiffer did a really good job portraying the sexiness and wildness of the character ,but let's be real here guys, this Catwoman is less and interesting character and more an loose woman in a skin tide leather costume, no offense to Pfeiffer I believe that you are a great person.Now apart from the strange sex under tones one other thing that ,this flick had it was that it is much more darker than the original. In the 1989 movie, yes it had the maniac the Joker, killings and Gothic image, but it was more like a Nightmare Before Christmas and less a horror movie. I don't know why but Burton did the reverse making is more horror flick and difficult to kids to watch. For real when I was ten I though that this film was a horror movie and I was afraid of it. And the design for Penguin, the criminals under his command and the streets didn't help either. So many parents didn't let their kids to go and watch the movie and for ones I don't blame them for it is more for teenagers than for kids.That had as a results the movie though it had more than twice of the originals budget it grossed far less and despite making almost 267 million this massive decline of gain made the studio to rethink who to make a Batman movie less Gothic and murdering and more friendly to children. Just for the record the 1989 film made a bit more than 411 millions so personally no matter what is send for the producer, if you had that facts in your had ,would you have similar ideas? But we all know how that went.",7,0,4,22 July 2016
Creed," Rocky is back!!
","Creed is the seventh movie in this franchise, which started way back in nineteen seventy six and has seen ups ( Rocky 1, 2 and Rocky Balboa), just enjoyable ( Rocky 3 and 4 ) and downfalls (Rocky 5). And Creed is in my opinion the best since the first and is my personal favorite. In short Creed is awesome and I was amazed that Stallone really this time acted, for real in constant wit what we have seen from him in resent years, for instance the Expentables series.So this film follows Adonis Creed, who as the name reveal is Apollo Creed's son and he wants to become a boxer like his late father, but here is the nice part : He wants to be famous by his own and not by his surname!! So he asks Mr Balboa of training and advises. One bonus fact is that is depicted as a fun of the Rocky lore, like we are, which shows that the writers wanted him be rel eatable and not be a puss over like with Jurassic World. Now the secondary characters like Creed's mother are human in their reactions ,but have their time to make a joke which after you see the flick, you will remember it.The training and fighting scenes were expertly choreographed and Micheal B. Jordan looked the part . But the person who stole the show in the flick was Rocky himself ,who now is more a father-mentor figure that the lead and this fitted him ,because lets be real ,Stallone you can not be a lead in a sport-action flick in your late sixties! If this is the end of the Rocky saga or the beginning of the Creed, is as yet ( June 2016) unknown. In any case is a strong intro to the story line of this franchise.",9,0,1,21 June 2016
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," The worst X-men flick!
","X-men Origins: Wolverine was planed to be the starting ground for the series Origins, which would show the beginnings of the heroes and heroines of this Franchise. Sadly the movie was panned by audiences and critics alike ,besause to give you the short version it was bad and the fact it didn't make enough money to be consider blockbuster and so the plug for the Origins series was drawn out.So which is the reason for its underwhelming performance? For starters had almost every cliché of an action film we all more or less know and we have seen in that least a dozen movies! If this was a simple action adventure, then none would wine about that, but when you try to make lead role the most favorite character of the X-men series ,the criteria go, logically, up! There is one ,now another issue was the underdeveloped characters in the movie ,I didn't like them ,hate, get interested for their stories at all and it goes with out saying what happened to Deadpool!Next to the list is the effects, wow, are hilariously bad!! For real some of them look so bad that I was wondering were did the 150 million dollars of the budget went. Probably to Hugh Jackman, the producers and the merchandise ,haha, I fart on your general direction. Finally it has more plot holes than a Swiss cheese and so many inconsistencies that you thing ,the writers never bother watching the previous installments.Final thoughts, if you are under twelve then seems horrifying and good ,but after puberty you realize who must it suck.",4,0,2,22 June 2016
Hot Fuzz," One of the best crime comedies ever!
","Hot Fuzz is now 10 years old ,so it is a good opportunity to review the gem of action, crime and comedy .For starters ,it is the second film in the Cornetto trilogy which is the brain-child of Simon Peg with his friends Edgar Wright and Nick Frost and in the film they more or less satirize and pay homage to the trademarks of buddy-cop films, while at the same time been their own thing.So the story is as follows: The ultra officer Nicholas Angel is transferred in to a tranquil village ,where things seems to be calm and the crime rate zero, not a good place for a man of action like him. But as it is obvious not all are as they look like and he tries to uncover what is happening. In general is a crime we have all seen but the way is done and the quotes are what makes this film awesome, what did we expect anything written by Simon Peg is hilarious and amazing and here he didn't disappoint.Another part of the awesomeness is the casting, they are all perfect and Timothy Dalton is the epitome of fun and sinister .And now that I mention the casting both the Hound and Walter Frey are in this one, goodness everywhere I look it seems that all the English actors and actresses are in Game of Thrones, awesome!In general the film rocks and it is the best crime comedy of the new Millennium since Snatch. It goes without saying that it is a must watch to every one who like action and comedy and cops film of course.",9,1,1,10 May 2017
Dead Poets Society," Pretty inspiring for a comedy
","Dead Poet Society is one of the most classic example of inspiration, that's the whole meaning of the movie ,do what you love or you dream and even if you fail at least you will be in peace with yourself that you try. This movie I was thinking when I started reviewing in IMDb, that I am going to write my personal opinion and whether they be accepted or not ,it is my adding in to the world of entertainment. Pobin Williams is one the best professors ever portals and if he really existed , I would gladly study his lessons. All in all it is one of the best drama and the moments which make it a comedy, are with no question amusing and you really fill happy seen them. To summaries I can not understand why lost the best picture by Driving Miss Daisy and not Born on the 4th of July and Dothe right thing, at least then I could say that it lost against good written ,impactful films , but here is like not giving Mary Curie the Nodel because she is a woman or in this case a comedy, Wow Captain my Captain.",9,0,0,20 March 2016
Terminator Salvation," The possibility was there but they just couldn't do it!
","Terminator Salvation is on papers an excellent idea, the back story of how the resistance manage to send Kyle Reese back in time in order for the events of the first film to take place.And to be honest the effects and battle scenes are very well made and compared with Terminator 3 and Genisys, it is a far better film from both in both characters and action. But there is the elephant in the room which is that the action scenes are few and far between, most of the characters are paper-thin and the story is quit jangled. In all honesty the film could have been really enjoyable, if they focused more in the current (before time travel) movie environment, we might had something like Rogue One, but history is not written with ifs and the huge issues of production and studio intervention dammed the project. Christian Bale reputation might suffered the worst due to a break down he had in the set, but let's be real we all faced a disappointing project ,which is stress-full, exhausting and irritating and few of us in some point we screamed and cursed our lungs out because of that, so Mr. Bale is not here to blame for that mess!!In the end Salvation is for me the point where everyone must understand that the Terminator franchise has no stem anymore and any idea for a sequel, prequel , etc. must be deleted and try something else that works.",7,5,7,21 May 2017
X-Men," The Starting Point
","The first X-Men is ,at the time of this review ,16 years old. Wow. It is amazing if you seat and think that for a minute, then you will realize that this movie is older from a large percent of the people who now believe that Superhero movies are the norm of Hollywood blockbusters. So it is an important flick,but I have to be honest though here we have THE MOVIE,which restarted the superhero as a genre in general after the death of it from Batman and Robin it is a little dated by today's standards. But its legacy it is unquestionable for it gave birth to the great superhero flicks of the New Millaia which dominate the Box Office.As for the casting Patrick Sturat as Professor X, Ian MacKellen as Magneto were wish fulfillment to fans around the world. Dispute these great casting Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is the show-steal-er here and his portrait is the reason why most X-men films have him as a center character and he was the only one to get solo films apart from Deadpool. And something mind-blowing is that when he was first announced many disagree ,because he didn't looked the part, but after that film mouths shut.As for the action is well directed and entertaining, though the final plan of Magneto is quit cartoony, which a bit ruins the film for me, but that is my only major drawback. As for the theme on which X-men were made, prejudice against the persons who are different from the average Joe or Jane is handle in a mature way and not shoved in.All in all if you haven't seen it for a long time re-watch it worth your time.",8,1,2,29 March 2016
The Terminator," Post Apocalypse from robot 101.
","We, humans, have imagined for centuries who the world would be in the future. This is one of the most usual setting for science fiction and the most common of that variety is the post-apocalyptic future, in which all things more or less goes to hell and humans have to survive in the wreckage of our fallen civilization. Now there have been many interpretations of that kid over the years in books, television series, comic books and most prominently in films. Now Terminator isn't the first science fiction film in a post apocalyptic world, far from it there have been dozens of them with some of the most well known up to its opening in 1984 be Logan's Run, Silent Running, Soylent Green, Blade Runner and Time Machine (1960). So what made to stand out of the crown?First it is the story ,which goes like this, in the future machines have rise up and we are in a war against them for survivor and dominance of the planet. During it Machines send back in time a robot, made to look like a human, a Terminator in order to kill Sarah Connor the mother of the leader of the resistance Jon, before she gives birth to him. For that the Resistance send also a human back to the same date in order to prevent the robot from its goal!The story was one of the most original at the time for it made a revolutionary change to the Post Apocalypse: use time travel as a weapon, back in 1984 this idea was ground breaking for none have though up to that point 'Why not kill the future at its root?. One other thing that was added was hardcore action in the mix and the result was so successful that after this flick many movies and comic books were written using this style, with 12 Monkeys and X-men Days of Future Past been just two examples.In short the movie rocks, the action rocks , the effects are awesome ,apart from one scene and I think that was the first movie to make the Predestination Paradox famous. Also the fact that from 1984 and beyond robot killing machine look much more threatening doesn't hurt either for before 1984 all robot looked like radios on legs!If you haven't seen it ,do it and if you believe that Terminator Genisys was a shame to the Terminator Logo ,we are on the same side!!",8,0,0,18 July 2016
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," The hero from Hell returns
","With the announcement of the Hell Boy 3 for 2017 I though it was a good time reviewing the second movie in this franchise. To start ,the action is much better than the previous installment ,with more creative being put in the manner of weapons ,which the characters use. Speeching for the character everyone plays his role nice and Doctor Kraus steals the show with his over the top accent ,suit and his abilities, incredible if you consider that he lacks any material form and he is just air!!To the plot, is a simple one on the one hand and informative on the other, to keep it simple an elver prince wants to awake the Golden Army in order to overthrow the human dominance of the world and it is up the Bureau of Paranormal Reasearch and Defense to stop him off course. The great thing is that with these plot we get also some history of how the creatures of the myths and the Humans interacted and you get why the villain of the story wants to do it. To add to the creatures the designs are incredible and the line between this a puppet , this cgi or both, is not very clear and you think that this being are there this includes Hellboy , Abe Sappien and Dr Kraus as well.The sad thing is that like with the previous installment this movie was not a big box office hit because, like with 2004 movie who open the same year with Spiderman 2 ,it open the same year with Dark Knight and Iroman show the audience went to these movies and completely forgot Hellboy. I do not say that these movies are bad no Spiderman 2 ,Ironman are great and Dark Knight is my favorite superhero movie and movie in general, what I mean is that we have to be more open to what entertainment is given to us ,both to keep the variety high and to open the door to artists who want to show their own unique style, being also stated that these product is good and worth your time and money! Over all if you haven seen these underrated superhero flicks do it ,you will see that they are enjoyable at the very least and to the fun out there of The Hero from Hell, gross fingers and lest hope the Del Toro has not lost his style.",8,1,2,29 May 2016
Spider-Man: Homecoming," On par with the first two Spiderman films.
","Spiderman Homecoming is the sixth film featuring our friendly neighborhood Spiderman and his first solo film in the MCU and I have to tell it right now to pull out of my chest, it is on par with the first two Spiderman films.Now to the film itself ,no spoilers of course we follow our high school hero as he tries his best to be a superhero and at the same time have a functional life as a student, good luck with that. At the same time we follow Adrian Toomes the antagonist of the film portrait by, let's face it a legend of the superhero community, Micheal Keaton aka the Vulture. What I like about this film is that we see how the effects of the actions of the Avengers in the world and something that now should be expected by the inhabitants of this world, get use to the superheroes, yes a new superhero is a interesting news, but not world changing as the world has already changed. To our new wed-sling-er, Tom Holland is excellent in his role and I loved seen him try to be a hero with various level of success, what did you expect he is a teenager, he is new in this game unlike Iron-Man ,Captain or Thor ,who have years or in the case of Thor centuries of experience, so his attempts are the predicted by a youth trying to get in to a grown up game. Also they nailed his nerd persona and over all difficulty to socialize in to his environment. And as for the subject how is the best Spiderman ,well for me they are both number 1 I can't and I won't decide. As for Micheal Keaton ,well he was quit good and this Vulture though differed greatly from the one from the comics and animated series, he was a good first villain for our new hero. This Vulture reminds me an pitch from What-culture for this character and I have to say if the creators of the film watched that video and though to apply some of the ideas in it, then awesome. As for Iron-Man he isn't much in the film, however here has taken the role of a father-mentor figure. Which was both funny and interesting as some years prior if someone saw Tony Stark he would say 'that is a terrible idea' now after the Avengers films and Civil War it was ,in my opinion, the natural progression of his character as now he and in general the original Avengers (Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Iron-Man, Thor and Hulk) have to take responsibility for the new heroes who have take inspiration by them (Scarlet Witch, Ant-Man and Spiderman, Vision doesn't count). The action is nice and creative ,nothing more. As for the jokes, well placed and in great quantity and quality. My last praise is the portrait of school life. It was great and though the cursing was missing (not at all, but it was minimized) the director and writers showed, they have a clue of how the mind of young person works, for further clues, go watch Cop Car.My issues now are, that it had some repeats from previous Spiderman films, the action as I said is good but not excellent and finally set up for future films. OK I now it is a shared universe and but I am starting to getting sick from the set up Marvel ,don't over do it , just sick to make good films ,as you do, and the audience will come.Over all it was a great experience and a solid introduction to the A class films of Marvel who are up to now (my view here): Iron-Man, Avengers, Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, Avengers Age of Ultron, Civil War ,Guardians Volume 2 and Spiderman Homecoming.",9,36,67,7 July 2017
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A fitting end for the original trilogy.
","The Return of the Jedi is the last film of the original trilogy and in many ways lacks some of the magic of the previous installments, but this is forgiving for three simple reason. One it ties the story nice and clean, two the battles are awesome and three we see Luke becoming a full Jedi and he ,like the rest of his team, kicks ass. I think the main reason why is so looked down is the fact that is not as historic as the New Hope and Empire ,but it just ends with the story nicely. Where is the problem with that? It is at least twenty times better from Spiderman 3 or X-men the Last Stand ,which were the ends of their own trilogies, but we all know how bad and disappointing they were and everyone wants to forget them, where as the previous two are well loved by all. In other worlds no be just a great closing chapter to a landmark of a series is not a disappointment ,but a Herculean task. I have already recommended the previous two and I will do the same with that , it deserves more love.",10,0,1,4 May 2016
Pan's Labyrinth," Gillermo del Toro maybe best product as yet!
","Now to be perfectly honest with you ,dear reader, I am a HUGE fan of del Toro films, with the Hellboy movies been among my favorites superhero and fantasy movies and Pacific Rim the best flick about giant robots since Iron Giant, so yes I genuinely believe he is a great director, writer and producer. And as far as I see it his best work as yet this one Pan's Labyrinth one of the most beautiful, atmospheric and captivating film I have ever seen in my life.The story takes place in Spain after the Civil War of 1936 to 1939 and follows the young bookish girl Ofelia ,who goes with her pregnant mother to a military camp under to control of her step-father, the general and commander of that place and one of the most cruel, arrogant and sadistic villain in movie history, who could give Ramsay Bolton a run for his money. During her stay at each opportunity she has, escapes in to a fantasy world that is just around her corner and confronts creatures that are both amazing to look at and totally terrifying. The movie also gives time to the rebel group that is hunted down by the Franco forces and their tries to survive and beat back the fascist in the camp.The contrast between the fantasy world that we among side Ofelia explore and the real one is close to perfect for we see both similarities and differences. To elaborate on that this contrast makes it impossible to see these two worlds separated for when you look closely you find out that in their structures and designs have some parallels that are too go to spoil you have to see them yourself.Another great thing about the flick is that the story feels like a fairy tail, but isn't like those we all know like Snow White and the seven dwarfs, Sleeping Beauty , the Little Mermaid and so on. For del Toro turn the model of the classic fairy tails complete on its head and gives you a story which feels both realistic in plot, out of this world when it comes to the fantasy elements, which looks as they were the child for a beautiful dream with a horrifying nightmare and you want to look over and stare at it at the same time.As for the acting, is perfect with Ivana Baquero that plays Ofelia been so good that for a while I forgot that she was acting, Doug Jones as the titled Pan as is usual for him been in to the character( literally) and the rest of the cast having their time to shine.For anyone who likes creature feature, fantasy, the fairy tails with a twist or in general good movies is a must watch, like now. And to close with a warning, it is not a film for children, not at all ,it is for a more mature audience ,so if you want to watch it with your kid, young nephew or niece ,do it as your own digression.",10,2,3,2 November 2016
Alien," Space and Horror all praise Lovecraft!
","To honor the father of horror I thought to review some film which has taken some inspiration from his work. Although a direct good adaptation of his work, apart from Re-animated, many directors over the years have used his elements to create some of the best horror film in history. My personal favorite is Alien from 1979.But some back-story for its creation is necessary:In 1978 in Ridley Scott had a food poisoning he was send to a hospital to take out that infection and he has said many times how terrified he was having such a alien thing in his body and the damage it made to him and so using that experience and adding some elements from H.P. Lovecraft one of the most historic horror-science fiction was made: Alien! The title itself is fascinating for alien means both an exeterrestrial as we usually use it and the original meaning is foreign, something we are unfamiliar with.This unfamiliarity has its roots of the elements of Lovecraft, which the crew of Alien used,with the most important been the fear of insignificance, the terror that we now face something that we can't say for sure what it is, what it can do and if we can beat. In short cosmic horror, the best kind of horror and even 80 years after the dead of Howard Phillips Lovecraft. And this flick did more that enough to made the audience fear desperate ,trapped and out of breath from fear.A note for new horror director (Who do a really good job with flick like Oculus, Don't Breath, The Witch and my man Del Toro with Crimsob Peak). If you want to create an excellent film take notes from Alien and you will be in a good way. As far as I know horror movies are beginning to come back and I am glad that we passed the era of torture porn. As for the jump-scares the eleventh hour is close!And now for the film itself ,this one Shining, Aliens ,Jaws and Oculus are the only movies that have made my crawl out of horror. The atmosphere is perfect the environment in the space-craft is eerie and all the actors do a fantastic job. As for the creature itself ,go watch man ,just that.All in all this movie is among the many films that you have to watch before you die and worth every minute. Also the extended edition is also perfect unlike with other cases George Lucas!",9,1,2,5 February 2017
Suicide Squad," Review of the later out put of the DC Universe V2
","When Suicide Squad first came out I thought that was OK and enjoyable ,but now after long and hard thoughts I change my mind and saw the mess that it is , although I find some enjoyment watching it, it was more of the type 'It is so bad it's good' rather than a genuine an appreciation for a good product.But because I am not a negative man out of nature I will start with the things that I liked and were good in the film. Firstly Viola Davis as Amanda Waller was a great casting choice and she was the bossy bureaucrat that comic fan we know and love to hate. Will Smith was good as Deathshot and not with out the usual over acting by his part. Even Jai Courtney made a good job as Captain Boomerang (no clue how but it happened). And also they were some decent action scenes here and there, specially in the middle. And that's all the good.As for the drawbacks wow boy does it have a lot and I can't recall them all so I will point out the obvious and most prominent. For starter where the character development? There is almost none. Then there is Harley Quin and the new Joker. Margot Robbie dispute the fact she did her best her Harley was quit obnoxious in the end.Not that I blame Robbie for that she was trying and with a better script could can excellent so keep her! As for the Joker he was in for what a quarter of an hour and this isn't the Joker, it was his loser cousin for Pim my Ride. And in the end I see no squad no team ,no camaraderie, nothing ,we haven't a real team. To go with the technical aspects effects were on part with those of Gods of Egypt ,that hurt much my eyes.To continue sometimes I couldn't tell what was happening during the fights due to the editing ,the coloring (which was dirty and ugly to look at) and the lighting. To close the technicalities I muss address the editing ,damn it was quit broken and uneven but I won't blame the directorial team for they had only six weeks to write the script and edit the film so they had their hands full.All in all the third film in the DC cinematic universe wasn't very good and over all continues the trend of DC sucks. For real Warner Bros. and DC pull your head from your ass and make a good flick.",6,1,2,3 February 2017
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Captain is cool
","This is on my top 5 MCU films at the time when this review has been written. That flick had it all and then some ,action, good drama, an mind blowing story and its outcome has opened this Francaise, which is now composed of movies and TV series, to a brave new world. The effects of the Winter Soldier, seen them in following movies and in Marvel's Agent of Shield the past two years made me convinced that after the Avengers, Marvel isn't done get and the fact that at 2014 Guardians of the Galaxy also came out, wow, you bet that the following years this cinematic universe won't die any time soon. To summaries this film made Captain America awesome and show us that he isn't a good kid because he's an American ,but because this is his nature as a person not only a Soldier as everyone were thinking.",9,1,3,19 March 2016
Doctor Strange," Dr. Strage Sorcerer Supreme is truly supreme.
","OK up to now it is clear as the sky that Marvel Cinematic Universe may never make a bad film for in eight years has put out 13 films and not a single one was disappointing, awful or bad, a bit underwhelming yes, not living up to its expectations yes but more than that ,nothing. And with the Sorcerer Supreme we are now in hits to losses 14 -0, damn.So OK it was quit like Ironman meets Harry Potter, but the performances were spot on with Benedict Cumberbatch ,as it is common with this actor, becoming his role and convicted me that the mystic arts are in good hands with him, although he remind me a lot House. As for the rest of the team Mads Mikkelsen as the main villain ( Dude stop playing villains it doesn't end well for you, but you do it excellently so keep going) was good for Marvel standards and he would made Voldermord sake in his tunic(?). Even the love interest of the Doctor (not The Doctor) was not just there but she was truly moving the plot. Personally credits for that has to go to Rachel McAdams, she was an excellent choice for her job, after her take down of the Catholic Church in Spotlight.To the effects,... I have years to see such since Inception, I mean OK they used the style of Inception but who cares, it was done in an awesome faction and I want more than that. It was a blast to watch such a beautiful and colorful scenes, that I felt a little bad that I didn't watch them in 3D.For costumes, I have only one thing to say, they were so much like their comic counterparts that I though they put them out of the pages and on to the scene.But I have to be the Devil's Advocate and point out my minor in deed issues with Dr. Strange. The jokes weren't always on point and a little lesser some scenes and at times we got too much exposition. There are my only concerns with the movie, total nit pics!All in all it is an awesome movie and if you can go watch on cinema, it worth every minute on them.",8,3,7,16 November 2016
Interstellar," Your Space Odyssey
","Interstellar is the most scientifically accurate movie I have ever seen, here as usually Nolan create an incredible film about the way we use science to go forward end combined with the determination as a specie to survive really send us to places we can't even imagine.Everyone plays their role perfectly and although you may don't understand fully the science ,you more than you get the fears ,hopes and that times desperation which our protagonist have deal with during their adventure in the star. Do not hear the people who try to find problems in the movie in order to make believe that it is rubbish, because it isn't firstly and secondary every film ever made has a issue or two but the good ones can overshadow them and be remembered funnily and Interstellar is in this category no doubt about that.",9,0,1,15 March 2016
Full Metal Jacket," Full Hardcore Crazy War!
","Full Metal Jacket is the third war movie that Kubrik directed and in my opinion is also the best for it shows the madness that is the essence of modern warfare ,in which the valleys of our society are thrown out the widow and are replaced with a system in which the humanity is worthless. I personally like very much for it is a lot of over the top moments, gruesome fights and a great criticism of the War in Vietnam and the war in general.The flick start with the new marines been trained in order to be fit for service. The training as you will see is made in order to kill the civilized and made these young men, killers and spoiler if you don't fit you ain't worth a s**t. The scene steal the nut job sergeant played by the real life sergeant Ronald Lee Ermey ,who is also the sergeant in Toy Story ,true story (:))!The second part of the movie is in Vietnam in which the devastation is more or less a mandating thing and the soldiers there seem to be calm in a alarming level. For Christ sake they sing 'Micky Mouse' while marching with casualties of war left and right!!! In short the movie shows with a brutal way that human aren't meant to be in War, for in War we go mad and nothing is holy then.In short you should watch, if you haven't already' for it is a landmark of cinema and a blush of flick in general. Have a good time!",9,1,2,6 July 2016
American Sniper," A great war movie, which is totally underrated
","The American Sniper is one of the newest movies in the war movie category and it truly shows how the war on Irak affected your protagonist, played by Bradley Cooper,and his family.First thing first, Cooper was excellent to the role,which was a big surprise to me because I knew him as a comedian,but here he really makes you believe that he is a strong yet traumatized warrior .Sienna Miller was also good at presenting to us what it meanings to be with a person like that and as I saw ,it is hard. Also I think that after letters from Iwo Jima this the best war movie that the old cowboy Eastwood has ever made because although it show us that some thing worth fighting for, the cost of war in the soul and body, it makes the gains worthless, if you can not be with your loved-ones. To conclude the people who say bad things about this flick are out of their minds and are either hipster or so called 'film-critics'who love to say that it is not Apocalypse Now, which is one of the greatest movies of all time but,they have pasted about forty years since then and a lot have changed, and lets be honest the war movies of the late seventies and early eighties are great but they are almost hilariously over the top and a bit inaccurate in a historical manner. In other words here the critics got it wrong and the box office right.",9,11,15,24 March 2016
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The worst Star Wars movie.
","In my point of view the Attack of the Clones is the worst of the Star Wars series as a whole. To start Natalie Porman portraits Amidala, the mother of the heroes of the future rebellion Luke and Lya, as just a pretty chick ,which has, for some reason , at the end a crash for a annoying teenager ,which has no control of his emotions and has killed a village. I do not care if they killed his mother, Anakin Skywalker is a Jedi OK to kill two to three persons in rage but then he should pull himself together ,not in sense do a small genocide!! Also the Jedis are even more useless the the Phantom Menance (if that is possible) and it takes them about 80% of the running time to act in effective manner. In the point they see a millions strong army just emerge almost out of thin air and the President of the Senate use them to take extra authority, due to the break up of the Galaxic Rebuplic.Why the can not think that something big is going on behind the scenes, if they can not read the mind of him( because he is the Leader of the Sith) or even the persons close to him? The battle at the end though nice to look at is clones against droids, in other worlds the soldiers in both sides are next to nothing to be as easy to replace as a pair of socks!! And the cgi is a pain to my eyes and seen it again ,brings me tears, because ,one the animated series The Clone Wars has better designs and is a TV series!! And second and most important Star Wars is at the every least lay the foundation of the Computer Generated Images (CGI) as a whole, with out its offer the effects may still look like as before Star Wars ,fake to the point of laugh.But my biggest complains are that this flick, first, is plain merchandise movie, made just to sell toys and action figures and not to tell a good story. Second and by far my biggest problem however is the man himself George Lucas ,who was director, lead producer and main financier of the movie. In other worlds ,he had total authority of the project and no one was in a position to stop him of put whatever he liked ,but not what was best for the project as a whole . If you have not seen it already and you hope to have a enjoyable experience, then you will be disappointed.",5,0,2,4 May 2016
Ant-Man," Tiny Iron-man, but still good.
","Finally I decided it is time to review the film ,which you can't tell the title with out chuckle a bit , because it seems so outrageous and silly and yet and yet the Marvel Studios still made a decent film out of it and bring one of the original Avengers on the big screen ,despite the lack of size ( ;)).So in the film we follow Scot Lang ,who is recruited by Hank Pim ,the original Ant- man in order to help him steal his plans of how to change a persons or things size. Add to the mix add some nice slap-stick , Corey Stoll as the antagonist and you have your movie ,which by all the marvel films so far I feel it as the most family friendly of them all, like the Home Alone or Honey I shrank the kids of the MCU. And that is by no means bad ,I actually believe it is good that MCU can make and films like that. Up to 2015 we had seen already ,WW2 film (First Avenger) ,Space Opera (Guardians of the Galaxy) , the technology genius (Iron Man) ,films about Gods (Thor) and not one but two big team ups (Avengers). In short ,yes the film feels like that has similarities with Iron-man but they are superficial at best. Also if you are inept in the comic history ,you know dear reader ,that Ant-man from the comics has the most mixed and controversial story from all the Avengers. So to watch a film about him ,been both faithful to the premise and in all honesty removing the parts which no-one want to see it was a pleasure and gave me quite a lot respect to the creating team.All in all if I have to compare the newest man with a power-suit with the original I would say that Ant-man is better than Iron-Man 2 and 3, but still far behind the first film. So buy or rent it and watch with the whole family.",8,0,0,20 May 2017
Captain America: The First Avenger," Little by the numbers, but quit enjoyable ww2 film none the less.
","Having reviewed the sequels of this flick, I though it is time finally close this trilogy with the first one of the group, The First Avenger. The reason why I didn't review it up to now was the fact Winter Soldier and Civil War are so good that completely overshadowed their predecessor, but this isn't right for the film is also good.In short this is the origin story of the most patriotic of all the Avengers, Captain (Wow captain ,my captain!) America, who before this film he was a joke for he was made to fight Nazis and be the poster boy of the Patriotism in USA. As a person who lives in a country in which USA wasn't the best ally ,I should have hated this movie on the spot, but I can't for a number of reasons.1. It is by default an alternate history ,with all the Hydra experiments and Super Soldier program, from were Steve Rogers gained his abilities.2.Although the story-arc is a bit basic,good soldier and friends versus Nazis, for the purpose of the movie works.3. The action scenes are great.4.The attention to detail in order to recreate the 40's setting, one of my favorites in cinema.5.Finally is the friendship between Bucky and Steve.Is every well portrait by Chris Evans and Sebastian Stan, bonus points that they are close to perfect for their roles.In the end the final product was good and even to this day the movie is in the top ten of the highest grossing flick about WW2 and after watching it ,I can't say it earn it with out reason or that critics.In summary is a good WW2 film, with superheroes in it and it is a lot of fun, I recommended with out question. Funny story if you think about it Captain is about nine decades old, man this isn't fair, I am not even a third of his age and I don't look so good!",8,1,3,7 October 2016
Predator," Hunter-killer born by a joke
","To start with Predator is one of the most well known and loved action movies of all time and it was even nominated for an Oscar! To be honest for a bit silly macho flick is awesome and after seen it, I understand the reason for that. Simple put is a movie made for Men, which have became an endangered specie nowadays.Apart from the usually prays I want to give you guys a lesser known fact about the way Predator came to been.To keep it short ,in 1985 after Rocky 4 someone, as the story goes, joked that in Rocky 5, Rocky would have to face an alien because he had run out of opponents to fight with and the producers of Rocky 4 Jim and John Thomas took this abused idea and made a movie out of it. For real this is the true story. This in my point of view the definition of a fantasy of one man is the reality of an other. Now go spread the word and use this story as a tool to silence everyone who says that ideas don't work in real life.",8,1,2,24 March 2016
Léon: The Professional," Relationship between and older man and a girl been not creepy.
","Léon is the best movie about the relationship of an older man with a girl and seen how much the Killing Joke did that so wrong and that this movie is an awesome neo-noir movie which as I mentioned to my Pulp Fiction review it brought this sub-genre back from the dead. So does it hold up with today's standard? Answer: Are you messing with me the flick rocks and here is why!The movie is a pulp or Hard Boiled film through and through. For disclaimer, Hard Boiled/Pulp movies are the crime stories in which a character faces an traumatic event and after that he or she tries to accomplish his or her goals. Also the story takes place in a urban environment, which has seen better days and as for the characters everything goes from corrupted cops to assassins with hearts of gold and anything in between. Just to make it crystal clean this stories are also detective stories but where the stories of Poirot, Sherlock Holmes etc take place in the aristocratic cycles of society , the Hard Boiled ones are more everyday stories , some examples of those stories are Dirty Harry, Sin City,Pulp Fiction and Leon.To our main story ,after the murder of her family twelve year old Matilda(Natalie Portman) is taken under the wind of the professional assassin Leon (Jean Reno) and form an unusual friendship in which Matilda learn the trick of the job. Apart of the amazing performance of Portman, Oldman(from corrupt cop to Comissioner Gordon, wow what a change) and of course Reno the film rocks because it is character-based and not action-based and it deserves the cult status it has.When a crime movie,comic or TV series is based of its cast then though it is harder to make a good action scene, it packs more for you had become invested to the character and you care who lives or dies. Just think that in the first Taken, how much you were nervous about Liam Neeson's character when he tried to find where is his daughter and how bored you were by the Taken 2 and 3 in which the story exist only for Neeson to kill some and not watch his character evolve over time. In the end Leon is a must watch for every person who loves a good crime story and as cult classics go this is one of the best in the area. Wow and be genteel to flower to those who have seen it you know what I mean!",9,1,1,22 September 2016
The Revenant," Freeze and Oscars go together!
","The Revenant is mostly known as the film that gave Leonardo Dicaprio his long waited Oscar after a career filled with one awesome performance after the other, but it is great and by itself ,even though as for accuracy falls a bit out, however the rest are spotless.The film follows Hugh Glass and his team as they venture out to the eighteen hundreds West in order to get furs and during their travel they get in to a lot of trouble and he is badly injured (you know how) a member of his team will play dirty for the group to leave him to die in this cold and inhospitable place. Dispute his condition Hugh tries to survive and eventually revenge his mistreatment. And here is where the actors, cinematographers and the directing and writing of Alejandro González Iñárritu go in and make this film a piece of art , with minimal dialogue, beautiful scenes and close to excellent pace.And of course I have to mentioned Dicaprio of here give it all and then some for with almost zero dialogue manage to carry ,about half of the film alone and I am sure that he and the rest of the team after the end of the shooting the were in desperate need of a warm bath and even I felt cold just by watching the flick. You know that it a good sign when the audience feels what they see in the scene and here it is no exception.All in all the film rocks, Leo won his Oscar fair and square and definitely watch it if you haven't already ,it is among the great Oscar films and not a Oscar grab, like Crash(2004) , Sheakespaer in Love(1998).",9,1,2,22 March 2017
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Parody of its prequels but at least it is fun to watch
","I am not going to lie Terminator 3 isn't near as good as the two previous flicks in the series, which are some of the most historic action and science fiction movies of all time and Terminator 2 is without question one of the best films in history period. So by no means I say it is good , all I am saying is ,you will at least have fun watch it ,something which it can't be said for Salvation and Genisys ,man what misfires!So even though the Judgment Day close more or less the time-line of the series, it was decide (for cash of course0 to continue the story but it clearly done in a harry and the final product was underachieving to say the list, but the unintentional comedy in the acting and the hilariously over the top action scenes saved it from been an awful flick to a 'So dumb it is funny'.Side note here Mr. Schwarzenegger I know you wanted work after been the governor of California ,but from this flick you had to figure out that your glory days were over and for real it is impossible to be a protector muscle mass in your fifties (now seventies), sorry I love many of your films, but the truth is the truth!!Overall not good ,but a enjoyable hour and fifty (forty nine but who counts?) of action one-liners and the one thing that saves the film, the ending, no spoilers here go watch to find out for yourself ,dear reader , but for those who have seen it, it was really unexpected to be honest.",6,1,1,7 December 2016
The Shining," A true cult movie.
","Shining is in my point of view a summary of a cult movie. When it first came out was killed by the critics and the audiences ,but over time it gather a devout following and it has become a classic of the horror genre as a whole and one of the best movies made by Stanley Kubrik. I can not say( OK write tactically ) for this one because what can you add on a flick which cane out in 1980 and it has been studied for literally decades!! A quick summary is that a couple goes to a hotel ,which is closed during the winter and after some weird events the father goes starts to lose his sanity ( to be fair is played by Nicholson who is born to play nut characters, for real his most famous characters are of their minds). Its scariness is not due to some stupid jumped scares, but the tone and the atmosphere is the true reason, it really makes the movie at times, creepy as f**k. It is also true that after the end of the shooting the building ,which was used as the hotel ,was buried to the ground ,no clue how did that happen!! So if their is a ghost there in the end then ,it may dislike the final product, man even in death some people do not have any taste. To conclude if you want to have some scary time ,them go watch it ,it is a great flick, in the end.",9,1,2,16 May 2016
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Where terminator should had stopped.
","Terminator 2: Judgment Day, what could I say that it hasn't been said before for this masterpiece of action, science fiction and technological innovation? The film has it all and then some. But having already review the rest of the series I believe it is time to close with these movies and what better closing than the best?In short, for those who haven't seen it yet ( what were you doing in the past two and a half decades? ), we again follow Sara Conor ,who after the events of the first flick has become a total bad-ass amazon in order to prepare her son of the incoming apocalypse and then come not one but Terminator and one of then is seriously up-gated. So it is up to our heroes to survive. As for the actors everyone does an excellent job ,but Linda Hamilton is the greatest surprise for she changed markedly and now is unrecognizable, as for her son Edward Furlon is awesome to his role and it is a shame that after this role and American History X, he hasn't made a decent career, for real you had the potential to be a 5 star actor and you drop it!! As for the original Terminator, Arnie was amazing ,but a part of me feel disappointed that after that role he has become a parody of himself, pity but a bit expected, he isn't Stallone who has some talent, Mr. Governor made unfortunately a career on his muscles and he got old he couldn't continue.And not the the focus of the film the effects,even now in 2017 still amazing, will CGI seeming new and with many practical effects and stunts, with some of them for real putting the actors or the stunt doubles in danger. Ahh, well ,this why these kind of films always rock for everyone is giving his best for his role and doesn't use chip tricks.All in all in retrospective the series should has ended here and all would fine and good, but greed came in and had to ruin everything. Highly recommended and a must watch to everyone!",9,4,9,8 January 2017
Edward Scissorhands," Burton when he made good films, this was one of them .
","Tim Burton was ones among them most loved and respected directors and writers in the business with his first films like Beetlejuice (1988), Batman (1989) and Edward Scissorhands (1990) been some of them and today I will review the later. In Edward Scissorhands, we follow a typical suburban family, who discovers Edward, a gentle, quiet and lovable man, who has a 'small' issue, he has scissors for hands!! OK, that seems wacky and nuts, but this Burton we are talking about and his style is intense to say the least. After-wards the family brings him in their home ,where the rest of the community starts to come to see that person ,ho frankly is as unique as it comes. Something I admire is that how they approach Edward, it was totally realistic ,think yourself how would you act if you saw a dude with scars in his face ,in goth clouting and wit huge scissors for hands, this how!! In general the film feels like a modern fairy tale with the mix of Gothic and suburban colorful image. One other thing that I have to praise is Johnny Depp as the title character. Also this was his first major big screen role. And unlike the ones we all have known and at this is point bored to see, he was completely unrecognizable as Mr. Scissorhands, very little dialogue and he mostly expressed himself through saddle facial moves and body language. Which is also really realistic for he was isolated for years and he didn't have any human contact for years up to now, so yes it is reasonable for him to be a little awkward.To continue we have also a romance in the film ,which is handle so beautifully that at times you feel sorry for our protagonist for even though he is quit nice, his fantasy , as it is showed by his enterprises when he uses his hands, is of the chart, he can't hang or pet some because of his hands. Pretty sad if you ask me, I mean we often hear about persons, who have incredible strength or possess a deep knowledge of martial arts, but they are unable to be physical with others out of the fear that they would cause intentionally any injury. Now think that Edward has literally sharp blades for hands, it is if not worse, then the next worst thing after the previous examples.All in all this a modern classic ,with a ending that will make you cry and it is high recommended to any couple or film-buff in general. Also like Princess Bride this is the one of the thousand romantic films that everyone can enjoy!",8,0,0,1 January 2017
Dunkirk," We shall at the beaches but at first we need to get out and fast of a beach.
","Clocking in in just one hour and forty five minutes long this the shortest film ever produced by Christopher Nolan after the Following his first feature film way back in 1998. Still in this short time you get five to six different perspectives about the Dunkirk's Evacuation during the first days of WW2 and the stress and fear the was in the air during these days.Through out the duration of the film you feel that time is in short supply and at any moment a bomb, a bullet or a torpedo will come and kill more soldiers who are trapped like fishes in a barrow and if this army is lost then the war will be over in a moments notice with the Nazis victorious! So Nolan and his team had a very difficult work to do and in all honesty they not only manage to make a good film but actually a great flick, boy after the Inglorious Bastards WW2 has came in full force in the cinema, I can't be more happy about that! The only thing that wasn't outstanding was the acting ,the actors did their part flawlessly, no doubt about that, however there wasn't any performance the stole the show. And that is fine for this was a story about surviving a insufferable situation and the heroic efforts of military personnel and common civilians who at times went above and beyond to save the stranded army there. As for effects, cinematography, authenticity and historical accuracy ,outstanding ,no other word can describe it best the work that was put here.Also the one thing that stuck with me was the music which reminded me a lot a ticking clock and filled me with fear and anxiety about what would happened next because if this army was lost then France and especially Britain would have zero capacity on continuing the war so it was a big deal at this point.In the end when the film was ending we got the famous speech by Winston Churchill and his remark that there is along way ahead of them with this conflict and the end. Although abrupt the end is totally in mud with the situation at hand 'Yes we saved our soldiers, but with evacuation you can't win Wars'.Overall this film dispute not been as brutal and bloody as Hacksaw Ridge of the previous year is still an excellent WW2 film like the Ridge and what can I say, Mr Nolan you are a magician in the director chair!",9,1,6,12 September 2017
Aliens," Be afraid be very afraid ,o wait wrong film, but still true.
","Aliens is one of the best sequels in film history for it took the Lovecraft inspired terror for : 1) continued to the horror elements almost excellently and 2) made it a pitch perfect action-film with awesome scenes, effects and many more!The film takes place sixty years after the events of the Alien, with out 's' in the end and we see Elen still recovering from the shock of the film now is been task alongside a battalion of space-marines to investigate some issues with the colony, which has been made on the moon of the first film. And then the marines find out that the enemy is way out of their league and it becomes a race for them to escape.What I am fan of Aliens is that it makes it clear that humans had it coming for the arrogantly settle a unknown place and with just brute force can fix the problems there. But as they say in Greece 'You make plans and God laughs at you!' and we see something else : the hubris of Ancient Greece ,the sin of too much arrogance and bolt actions with out thinking first. And Cameron has stated that he draw inspiration of the Vietnam War for the theme of 'The Big Bad Marines biting more than they can chew' .Ok that is one nit pick of mine with that film, but I won't blame the directorial team ,but the eighties for film which had some kind of conflict ,usually used the recent then experiences from that war to show how bad was the situation in the flick. Alas if it is done nice I am unable to crumble about it and here it also the case. One other pros of the film is the effects, gore ,practical all that good stuff which I love from action films of the eighties, because they are real, the actors can react in and with it and so their job is made a lot easier to be what they must be in the studio. Which in this case is people in a hostile environment.Also Sigourney Weaver is awesome in her role and I consider her role as Rirley and she continued the long standing tradition of strong female characters in Cameron with the likes of Sara Conor and Neytiri. For if you think it for a moment the majority of leading female characters in action flick is only by him , Tarantino and George Miller if you include Fury Road (Which I do!).In conclusion if you haven't seen it, what were you doing in the last three decades? Go watch it and if you are a man and have a girlfriend ,then watch it with her to show her that you appreciate women for more that their looks!",9,1,1,14 February 2017
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Best X-Men movie up until Deadpool!!
","X-men Days of Future Past is the best X-men Movie of the main series and second if you count Deadpool. It is based in the comic of the same name and for those in the loop here is the basic story. After devastating War against the Sentinels ,robots programmed to hunt mutants, the team of the X-men sends Wolverine back in time in order to stop the cause of the fight from ever happening and by that preventing the War from occurring.The future itself is terrifying and comparing it with the mid seventies,where Logan has gone, makes you wander how an action decades before a tragedy can make or prevent the event. In the seventies also we meet the main cast of the characters of the First Class and thanks to Wolverine they are completed in the persons we all know and love. Personally after seen the flick for a third time I think that this is a Mustique film because her characters' actions show if we humans can become better or not and I really liked the portrait of Lawrence ,she is the end all Mustique ,from point of view. Pity that after the newest film she will leave the role, but she at least gave us a career define role.Although the director has made some changes of the original comic the basic is there and Singer adds something more : Hope. Apart from time travel, the fear created by racism , amazing action and see both the previous cast and the new in the big screen, this X-men movie has based on hope for the future ,hope for no matter how bad it gets we can still find a solution and as Patrick Stuart himself said in the movie: 'If someone lose his path does not mean that he will stay lost' .In the end I love this flick and is my favorite comic book movie of 2014 ,even more than the Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy! With Bryan Singer on the director chair I feel safe that Apocalype will be good and the main cast are as solid choices as they get ,so Mutant and Proud comic and in general geek comrades :) !!!",9,1,1,16 June 2016
Captain America: Civil War," The best of the Marvel Cinematic Universe so far!! :)
","Civil War is the closing chapter to the Captain America Trilogy and it rocks. To add to that ,altough its unlucky numbering, (it is the thirteenth installment of the MCU) it managed to be what we wanted and much more. To start all the characters were awesome and the new Spiderman.. THE BEST, Tom Holland is the most comic book accurate portrait of the friendly neighborhood we ever had in the big screen. Also Black Panther was great and now guys we have a royalty in the team ( OK another loyalty because there is Thor, but is more a God than a prince). The action was mind blowing thanks to the Russo Brothers ,these two are the Coen Brother of Action Flicks. Last but not least the arguing between Captain and Ironman was amazing ,because from either way they were both right and you could get why the had this ideology. I more than like it and go see it now, if you want to see Superheroes battling out , but you wished Batman V Superman be better. Well your wishes came true!",10,1,6,9 May 2016
Batman Begins," Bats is back to the spotlight!
","When Batman Begind was announced ,they were already several attempts to bring back Batman to the Big Screen after 1997, but all of them failed. Then Christofer Nolan fresh after Memento, was hired in order to direct this movie and he cast Christian Bale, who had made a name for himself with roles in American Phycho(2000), Equilibrium(2002) and the Machinist(2004),but he hadn't become an A-list actor yet. In general although the team for this movie was looking good, everyone was worried that this would be a flop many criticized the cast of Bale as 'not Batman enough'.Then the flick came out in June of 2005 and took the world by storm, for it wasn't just the film fan wanted ,but also the one which they needed and deserved. Now it may made less than the Batman of 1989, but comparing it in box office numbers with the rest of Batman film, it was the second in the list. As for the audience and critics loved it for its darker more realistic tone and the felling that it wasn't just a superhero movie,like the Spiderman movies and X-men, but a crime drama ,with a vigilante in an awesome Batsuit and some terrifying villains to face.Now let's see why the film rocks: Firstly the casting is close to pitch perfect, everyone from Morgan Freeman's Luscious Fox to Micheal Cane's Alfred and Garry Oldman's James Gordon are as good as they could get and the cherry on top Christian Bale as the Caped Crusader, one of the best casting choices in superhero history and in film in general. He is totally in his role and you really come to understand why he turn to such extreme ways to fight crime. Secondary the designs ,from the Gotham City area ,to the Bat Cave and prisons are great. The show stole two thing the Batsuit and the New Batmobile, the Tumbler. The suit itself is great,though a bit bulky to say the truth, but the design and the gadgets on it are so realistic that at times you think 'wait can this be real?', as for the Tumbler, it is my personal favorite Batmobile for it gets it anything right that is necessary for a good Batmobile, the mobility, speed and usefulness and it adds to it some tricks that are too awesome to write them down ,just go watch!Finally the last part that made me give to the film a 10 out of 10 was themes. In short the main was fear and how do you deal with it, for Batman is at his core than victory of man over fear against pain, injustice and for a minor theme inside the flick ,the legacy you are going to leave after you are done. The second major theme is the definition of justice and here is where the other core value of Bats comes out, he refuses to kill, no matter the situation for as he says 'I am not going to become the enforcer of the law!'!In the the film's impact can be seen in the cinema as well in the Bond series, Star Trek and to the X-men films after 2005. In short this is one of the most historic films in the superhero genre and many non- superhero films also have elements of it in them. To EVERYONE go watch it immediately!",10,1,2,27 July 2016
The Princess Bride," A romantic movie that is good?!
","I do not like romantic movie for a start. I think them nothing more than a cash cow in order to attract stupid girls in order to live their unrealistic love fantasies and if they have a boyfriend to torture him in the process. But sometimes , one in a thousand I may say it comes a romantic flick that is a quality entertainment for everyone, EVERYONE. Princess Bride belongs in this category because it focuses more in the story ,making it fun, and to the characters in order for the romances to become more 'realist', in which I mean to make sense the couple to want to be together and you to wanted that to.Also the sword fights are well choreographed and the one liners are clever,funny and take you off guard. To everyone guy, who have a girlfriend ,if you try to find a romantic movie that you can have fun alongside your romantic partner with out wanting to shoot yourself after words ,then this the flick for you ,have fun!",8,2,4,10 May 2016
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Primates rising!
","After the disaster the remake of Planet of the Apes of 2001 was, a decade later this was the next try in order for the series to start again and this time paid of and we now have a trilogy of these films. This one and the two next take inspiration more from the latter film of the original series (mainly Conquest and Battle), which they weren't very good to be honest and did their own thing.In the story we follow the now iconic chimpanzee Ceasar from his early days to the beginning of the events that started to fall of our society. This start comes from a try of us to cure brain diseases ,but when tested to Apes ,it has the unexpected outcome of making them smart to a point that match a humans intelligence. In short this is both a prequel of the 1968 film and a remake of the how we ended with that society. In general what I praise of that film is how it tackles one of the most baffling problem of humanity, how would we treat a creature of similar or even equal intelligent level which doesn't fit our definition of what is a human or a clever being in general. And if you have seen a lot of sci-fi series and movies you may have noticed the uncanny similarities between the alien and us, this no coincidence and I don't have to mention the manner of the treatment we did to our fellow human when they were different from us.In general this how a remake should be done, both being faithful to the themes of the original and at same time doing it in a different way. Also there is and a third idea from my point f view, do remakes of films that weren't very good or they are now dated to a point they look ridiculous ,however they had an idea which could be used and make a great film, this film is a great example, the Thing of 1982 is also and the Fly of Croneberg.Overall is a very well made film and manage to introduce this franchise to the new generation and re-kindle the interest of the older fans.",8,1,1,20 July 2017
City of God," Goodfellas of Brazil!
","City of God is by far the best film about the underdeveloped areas of Brazil and the fact many of the actors, producers and crew were from the district of the same name gives to the flick much more faithfulness to its source. In summary go watch for it is amazing, brutally honest and it doesn't fear to be funny, make the characters likable and to show the more day to day problems of life, like as the narrator say' find a girl'.This is important because a lot of people believe that ,in areas with high crime rate life is 24 /7 miserable ,well it has its dark moments yes, but humans are adaptable and can find happiness anywhere they live and this film shows that in an excellent way. The performances from even the little kids are great and you almost think that you saw a documentary with the realism in the scenes. That's because is partially true for the film is based on the accounts of the real life inhabitants of the City of God in Brazilia Brasil.Here we see the story of this area from its foundation in the sixties to the urban and dirty environment of the eighties as we follow our narrator Rocket who lives in the area and we learn through him the history, the habits ,the inhabitants and status quot at any given moment in the story. For a film made with only 3,3 million dollars it is amazing directed and thank God ,dispite the low budget no sake camera! The people we meet in the City have their flaws and redeeming qualities, which is awesome, for it makes them totally human.The only sad part isn't that the film isn't known or praised or even didn't make money ( it make 30,6 millions). The tragedy lays to the fact that thirty years after the events of the movie took place, the urban centers of Brazil and in general South America haven't ,with the exception of Chile and Ecuador, got better and crime, drugs ,police brutality and corruption still ruled these areas and unfortunately the problem doesn't show and sign of recovering.I really liked it and I am total to my title 'The Goodfellas of Brazil' for this historic gangster flick has influenced it and the writers have said that took inspiration from 'Funny how?', but they didn't copied it, they studied its best parts and applied them to the story while being faithful to their own vision of how to make a great film.",9,1,3,30 June 2016
X-Men: The Last Stand," A failed ending
","The last Stand is without a doubt the worst of the original x-men trilogy. It is dumb,boring and the characters in the movie are neither likable nor persons that you could relate to like the first two movies. This movie was the beginning of the 'New Dark Age', as I call it, of comic book movies that lasted for about 3 to 4 years and the majority of that type of film was either critically, commercially or both banned and it took the rise of the Marvel Cinematic Universe for the the superheroes to come back even stronger than before. This would the worse movie in the x-men film series up until the X-men Origins Wolverine ,which is considered to be one the worse films of the superheroes' movies as a whole",6,1,1,15 March 2016
Hellboy," Underrated
","Hellboy is one of the most unique movies in the superhero epoch we live in, because despite the mostly critical acclaim it gain ,like its sequel ,it wasn't a box office hit like Sam Raimi Spiderman or the X-men movies. That is sad because Hellboy is a really nice film ,full with good humour,elements of horror and awesome creatures designs,which you can't tell if it is computer generated or practical effects. Guillermo del Toro brought to life perfectly this world,within which paranormal creatures live beside us and the Bureau of Paranormal Investigation and Defense does its best to keep our world save and sound. If you love fantasy theme movies and have a soft spot for lovecraftian creatures coming to life ,give it a watch, I am pretty sure that you will at the very least like it.",8,2,2,17 March 2016
Ghostbusters," Ghostbusters! Need I say more.
","Ghostbusters is one of the most known movie of the eighties and has become, like the Evil Dead ,a go to flick for beating back ghosts and devils in general. So with the new movie been coming, I believe it is time to review the movie that mixed science, paranormal and comedy. The story is well known ,but for those who have no idea about it (I pity you) , a team of scientist is trying to find ways in order to track down and capture ghosts in order to get fame and money for their research and for Bill Murrey get lade.Now let's analyze why did it get so much fame. Is it good as a flick?Yes it is definitely entertaining as hell, with great one liners, jokes that we still use and of course it epic theme song who everyone know, from the movie ,the television series (from there I learn it) or videos from YouTube. Also it manages to bring two genres that usually don't mix well science fiction and fantasy with great results! And Bill *beeping* Murray, he deeds no introduction, he is awesome in every movie he is in ,except from Garfield.Does the effects hold up nowadays?Not very well, I mean they are nice to look at and they don't feel fake. However comparing them with what has come... there is no comparison they haven't aged very well and today even a ten-year-old can say the difference between the effects and the costumes on scene. But there aren't so bad there are joke ,are still descent.Final question: Do we need a sequel?The trailer for the up coming flick is banded and some say it will suck loyally ,but I believe we have to see the final product in order to say if it is good or not. However when Ghostbusters 2 came out many said that it was unnecessary and it was a shame for the Logo ,but after more than two decades it has get a great cult following with many saying now that the backlash was an overkill and why we don't have a ghost busters 3.In general, cross fingers and hope that it will good and that fun overreacted ,it won't be the first time!",8,1,2,6 July 2016
X-Men: Apocalypse," Great closure of the new trilogy
","X-men Apocalypse has received mixed reviews from critics and some audience members, but I will say that ,is awesome no doubt. For starter it introduce the characters of Storm, Nightclawel, Cyclops, Marvel Girl and continued the thing of the new trilogy, with the First Class been in the sixties, Future in the seventies, this was in the eighties and the setting ,the costume and the references show that it was put work in to it.Now when I went to see it ,I had just finish my exam period in the university and I wanted something to light up. I get it and much more. For the title character Apocalypse I was pump and Oscar Isaak took this character ,whose freaking name is APOCALYPSE and gave an great performance ,that combine with the fact that the powers of the character were more that he fingers in my hands gave me much joy. To the story Apocalypse lived during antiquity and was praised and after a big sleep he awakes in the '80 and seeing how the world had become he decides to give lessons in power. For that he takes four persons to be his horsemen and increase their powers to maximum. Between them is also Magneto ,just THINK a buffed up MAGNETO my lord of Light protect me. Against them are the X-men who are a mix among the older team and the new students ,great!This movie like the First Clas is an X-men movie with out Wolverine in the lead role, though he makes a small cameo and I will say I was waiting to see him like that since the two thousands', the same apply to many of the new X-men who were much more in the movie than I expected and the actors done a fantastic job. Sophie Turner as Gean Grey, great choice and she is really well suited in this uncanny team, first you take the North and now the X-men I bend the knee to the new Queen of the Nerds!Now to the theme of the movie, here is family and what we are willing to do in order to have one, protect it and avenge it ,if it went there, the movie shows what are the X-men apart of superheroes ,are a family and as Macvoy says 'I feel sorry for the man who is going to hurt them (X-men)' ,thanks Professor you are awesome. Now I get a bit why critics have hit this movie show much, it is because after Days of Future Past, Deadpool raise the standards for X-men flicks and the fact that only three weeks before Civl War was in release made many people to compare them and lets face it Civil is the best movie of Marvel so far! In the end between Batman versus Superman and Apocalypse the latter took wrongfully show mixed reviews. Also this the last movie with Jennifer Lawrence as Mustique ,pity but we end up with a high note.",8,14,22,2 July 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," A disappointment in the end
","Amazing Spiderman 2 is the definition of a broken movie. For those in the loop, broken,as I know it, is a flick that its elements of the storyline does not join well and you fill that what seen you saw do not make any sense. A broken movie isn't necessarily bad ,for instance 12 Monkeys is a broken movie ,but it is quit good. No here we have the bad type, because its story lines within the movie are related with a very dumb way and they made the same mistake as Spiderman 3: too many villains. Also Andrew Garfield portrait of Spiderman is to over the top for me and to put simple does not convince me that is a true hero, just a teenager who have powers and has fun with them. And the villains ,o boy they are even more stupid than Spiderman 3, there at least they had some understandable reason to hate Spiderman, but here they were just some ugly CGI creatures. The only thing going for is the chemistry between Garfield and Emma Stone and the opening apart of that is pretty boring. I understand why Sony team up with Marvel now, cross fingers for Civil War comrades.",5,0,5,12 April 2016
Transformers," If you see it drunk then you will have more fun
","I grew up watching during the weekends Transformres, I also ,like any 10 to 12 year old boy Transformers' toys and I put then to fight.So I will give you my point of view to the first Transformers movie ,which came out in 2007. The reason why ,I start with this and not the most recent one is the fact that ,the first of this Franchise is the best and by best I mean most tolerable to watch ,because the next three are treason against the Cybetronians as a whole. To start with the good part the CGI are almost perfect and the voices of Optimus and Megatron are amazing. And now the bad part. Firstly everyone here acts awfully indeed and the worst were by fact Megan Fox and Shia Lebouf ,their characters are so stereotypical that the supporting cast seems to play OK, and that no easy feet. Next the action is fully of unfocused scenes, sake camera and too many stupid one liners. Thridly and by far the most significant reason , why I have negative feeling for this movie is the fact the the Tranformers are not the MAIN characters in THEIR OWN MOVIE. To add insult to injure this flick nominated for 3 Oscar. WHO? This has no explanation apart for the effects part. The last complain is the ending which although is not horrible, I felt it rushed when I saw again the movie. The funny thing is that , when I was in my teens and Isaw for the first time I like it ,but when after a year when I saw it again one year later ,was a nostalgia killer ,for a time I end up hating the Transformers. If someone is to blame is the Paramount and Micheal Bay, the later has more blame because he made of Franchise out of it and thanks to the previous mentioned acclaim ,his ego went berserk. As a result of that, the following flicks were even worse. First Tranformer ,then Teenage Mutant Nintza Turtles and in 2017milk to it will come out a Power Ranger movie ,it is official, Hollyhood is set on milking to death our childhood.",6,0,1,22 April 2016
Guardians of the Galaxy," Marvel's Star Wars
","Guardians of the Galaxy is one of my favorites superhero films and movies in general. This is one of the funniest ,haywirest films ever directed. It shows also ,that the marvel studio has the courage to invest into even the lesser known hero teams of the marvel universe and still make a enjoyable movie out of it. As someone can see from my summary above, from my point of view these team is very much alike with the Star Wars' team ,but it doesn't become a simple copy,instead is shown, in reality, the Guardians have their own storyline ,which is simply a child of Star Wars. Also the comedy is excellent as well as, its cross with the sci-fi elements, creates a ton of entertaining and even thought provoking moments. To conclude I hope the 2017 sequel to be as good as the first ,continuing Marvel's score (up until today in march 2016) of zero bad outings.",9,1,6,3 March 2016
The Evil Dead," Small budget ,huge pay off and copycats!
","Evil Dead of 1981 is among the most historic horror movies and low budget flicks alike.The 22 year old back then Sam Raimi with only 350 to 400 thousands dollars at his disposal and his closest friends, among them the now legendary Bruce Campbell, he made the ground zero for the cabin in the hoods archetype we all know and frankly had ourselves full of it. So that is a bonus reason why to watch it or re-watch: to see how this sub-genre of horror is done well.The story is simple,nice and neat, five friends go for some days in a cabin in the hoods and during their stay there are attacked by demonic spirits and do their best to survive this onslaught of demons and gulls.And there is the stuff that imitators are made of ,for many future directors and studios just saw the low budget and high score (with only limited release it made 2.4 millions, which means about 6 times its budget) and went berserk to carbon copy the formula in order to get a piece of this new pie.As I have wrote before this one of the issues with the movie making business, when something new comes into view and critics, audiences and even the Oscars love it, studios don't look why the movie or series of movies made money, for the causes like ,good script, nice characters, captivating scenes which made sense in the story, the original or good- looking or interesting cinematography. No they focused to the gore, locations of the incident and genre, the external features of the flick and not the ones that matter. For the people don't love Star Wars, Deadpool or Saving Private Ryan ,because are science fiction, gory and R-rated or brutal respectively, they like them for their unique style, story and characters.Anyway to finish my rant about this issue ,when something is popular don't carbon copy it, made the style your own and give it something of you, this why City of God is praised like the movie from which took inspirations The Goodfellas and Legends was boring as hell.As for the legacy of Evil Dead, it is huge and has got a cult status equal to the Clockwork Orange, Fight Club and Labyrinth and today is put at the same category with classics of the horror genre like Dracula (1931), Psycho (1960), Halloween (1978), Jaws (1975) and Scream (1992). To add to that even nowadays we see it in its great sequels and TV series which as far as I heard of is pretty groovy.All in all I recommended for anyone that likes horror movies and new directors who want some idea how to make their first horror flick. Also to the latter group if it isn't as good as you wanted to, don't be too hard on yourselves, usually the first time is the hardest and the one with the most mistakes, the next one will be better, expect from Syamalan then it is the other way around lol!",8,0,1,7 November 2016
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Sexiest killer ever!
","If you said to me that I was going to die by the hand of some of the women of this movie ,I would die a happy man for this film is any martial art expert wet dream. Pretty girls with swords, gory deaths and the dialogue made by Quentin Tarantino ,sign me in!!The movies follows the Bride as see goes on a vengeance quest to assassinate the people who try to killed her in her wedding day. God an other mass killing in a wedding ,it makes you think if R.R. Martin inspired Tarantino or the slaughter in this flick the producers of the series in the Rains of Castamere! Who knows, but it is fun to try to connect two amazing productions for it is confirmed by Quentin him self that all of his movies are in the same universe! So he is not a uninitiated to this idea.The dialogues as we all know by now are quick, quotable and create tension by themselves alone. Every character is unique and you come in a few minutes know his story art, temper and ideals. What would you expect after innovative killings ,sharp dialogue and great cinematography, the other strong point of Tarantino is that he can flesh out characters in a matter of seconds ,there very few directors and writers who can do that. So that flick deserve rightfully its cult status and more than a decade after it is in everyone list of amazing flicks.If you haven't seen ,as the man said himself :' The *beep* you were doing the past years ,living under a rock?'.",8,3,6,30 June 2016
Logan," Wolverine close with a blast
","Logan is, as we know for the time, the final film of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and after the awfulness of Origins and The Wolverine which was just a good action film with a weak ending ,I wouldn't imagine that the final chapter of our hero to be as good as it was rumored to, but in the end was even better.For starter the film takes place in 2029 and Wolverine and Professor X are in their last ,they are tired and their abilities aren't working as they used to. It was extremely painful for a big fan of the X-men watch these to legends be like that. However we still see glimpses of their old selves and with Wolverine when it comes out it is epic to say the least. Also they found a young girl who has abilities and they help her escape from their pursuers.What I loved with the film was the fight scenes and imagery who justify complete the R rating and gave us the Wolverine film we wanted to see in years. Another pros of the flick was the quiet moments between the action which flesh out our protagonist showing us that dispute the low point of the mutants in this film, what drives the plot is hope for the future for if they manage to save that girl then she at least will have a better life than the had.As for the man himself Hugh Jackman was amazing ,this is by far his best interpretation of Wolverine and he portrait very well this weary and grumpy version of the most popular X-men. The little girl was the show steal-er ,as her action scenes for me were the best in the film. As for the villains Pierce and his superior are the second best villain I have seen in the X-men films since William Stryker and I like that they didn't do what they did out of hate but by their point of view they were fixing a mistake of them. Which is realistic for the best antagonist is the one who thinks that he doesn't do something evil for evil sake but either good or his job and here is the later.Finally the emotions that this film brought out to me were sadness, fear and at times relief. The relief is mostly for the quality of the film for it is from my point of view, the best super-hero sequel since the Dark Knight. Definitely go watch in cinemas and be aware it isn't a kids film or a pop-corn action.",10,1,5,6 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Don't hate it, it's OK
","The sequel to the Avengers was no doubt one of the most hipped movies in history. Everyone waited for the dark knight of Marvel's All Star Team and dispute the fact that the first was better Age of Ultron in all honest did not disappoint me in any way. All the cast members played their roles nice the villain Ultron had truly the power and capacity to be a real danger to the world. Also the ending was quit fitting and set quit good the seen for the follow Marvel movies. In my point of view the movie fell victim to the population of angry nerds, who try find errors even to excellent superhero films, because now the fact that know every minor thing about the superheroes and heroines, who have become box office giants, give them advantage over the rest film-lovers and they use it to show their self as all knowing and the rest are idiots. Listen everyone I am also a divot follower to the pantheon of superheroes and I say its fine, if you like superheroes in cinema and just happen to know a thing or two more ,then go introduce the new generation to this world, do not use it to show how amazing you believe you are. Remember with great power comes great responsibility.",8,0,3,13 March 2016
The Dark Knight," It is a excellent film.
","The Dark Knight is in, my opinion ,the greatest superhero film ever made and one of the best movies in film history.This film has more than the fan boys and fan girls asked for,it also has the makings of an excellent movie from an action point of view ,a critic view and of course a blockbuster view. It is the movie that solidified the superheroes period of cinema ,in which we live. I believe that it will became one of these movies that you have to see before you die, like the Godfather ,Lorens of Arabia ,Ben Hur, Saving Prinate Ryan,Schinder's list and so on, if it is not already. To conclude, if you are alive and you love films and superheroes ,like myself, then go see it ,right now",10,1,2,21 February 2016
Toy Story," The first full length CGI movie
","Toy Story has become at the time of that recording 21 years old. Twenty One!! This the most influential animated movie since Snowwhite and the Seven Dwarfs, which is the every first full length movie and it came out in 1937!! OK to pull myself together ,I am pretty sure that the majority of you, who read this is under 18 and can not think of a time before all animated movies used CGI. And the amazing part is almost everyone though that Toy Story would be flop and their luck of faith, although disturbing, was way off. Also the characters like Woody, Buzz, Rex and the rest of the gang have rooted in pop culture and its sequels are awesome in their own right. In all honesty I cannot choose which of the three is better I love them all equally. To summaries Toy Story is one of the best family flick ever made and you should show it to your kids and maybe re-watch, yourself dear writer, all the trilogy with the Toy Story 4 coming out in 2017!",9,0,1,5 April 2016
Toy Story 2," It was planed to be direct-to-video!
","Toy Story 2 is the sequel to the movie Toy Story of 1995 and when the movie was in the drawing broad it was planed to be a direct-to-video sequel for up to 1999 Discey had a habit to make such films and always lacked the magic of the original theatrical installment. The examples are too many to count, but just for the record some of them are The Return of Jafar, Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas, Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World and The Lion King II: Simba's Pride. All of them are either disappointed or down right a insult to the original, with the exception of Lion King 2, which although it isn't great ,its story and character are decent.But due to the popularity of the original and the quality of the story the Discey studio decided to give to the film a proper theatrical release. So in 1999 the film opened and immediately critics, audience and in general everyone loved it! Some of the critics even said that it out shined the original. Personally I disagree for the Toy Story trilogy is so well made that I see it as one animated film of four hours and forty minutes run time! Now the story follows Woody, Buzz and the the rest of the gang to their new adventures. During the film Woody is stolen by a collector who wants to sell him for profit and has it is know you mess with one, you mess with everyone and so the gang organize and send a rescue team with Buzz himself as the leader! I loved that Buzz when he saw his friend in trouble he didn't though twice to go and save him, this shows that after the events of the first Toy Story how close are these two, indeed one of the best bromance in cinema history! Also we learn about the history of Woody as a Toy and the depth of Woody and Buzz friendship, man a Cowboy and a Space Ranger as best friends, awesome. In the previous film the theme was identity and that you can determine it yourself. Here is how much important is to be part of a family, team and generally have a place to call home. And the trouble our rescuers face in order to save Woody really shines that importance and put Bernard and Miss Bianca to shame! We also meet new characters that are just as spirited and fun as the main cast with Jessie steal something more than the show, Buzz you know what I mean ;).To conclude, just watch it and if you have kids watch it with them, for this is one of the best family films of all time, and for those who have already watch 'I am your father'. Even then Star Wars was referenced in films!",9,0,1,21 July 2016
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," This movie sucks big ,big time, like the rest!
","Before 50 shades of awfulness, this series was the most hated thing in cinema and I am going to say that it deserve every small or big hate that it took and I am one of the persons ,who hate it with a rage of a thousands Suns!! To start the characters are dumber than a spoiled tomato ( I wanted to use worse language ,but the IMDb program does not allow that, whatever) and the pedophilia of the alpaca (Jacob) is disguising to say the least, the effects are bad beyond the point of hilarious and to the point of being bored to death. To skip a lot of things the final battle against the loser cousin of count Dracula in the end it did not (spoilers!!!!!!!) happened ,I mean even the movie of the Ninja Turtules of 2014 although the first third is stupid ,the final battle is cool and close the story in a at least satisfied manner (for real the last 30 minutes are awesome). I remember went I try to watch the first Twillight and after I was close to kill myself , likely I passed the shock with a nice shower and really to see the water on the floor was a more fun experience form these movies all together. Now to the final part is this 'saga' the worst thing ever, in my point of view the man of the Channel of Awesomeness said it better is the worst thing of the past decade and for the persons over 30 this is the worst product of entertainment of their life ,but do not fear we homo sapiens are quit good at making bad thing ( genocides, economic crashes, these movies, colonization, world wars and 50 shades) every generation will have this one product of out culture which will be bad in every way possible. And if you are someone who like it, dude what in the name of Lucifer is wrong with you! In the end this is the worst box office franchise of the first two decades of the new millennial and its awfulness will live in infamy. Let us all remember it in order to prepare ourselves for the next strike ,went a person decides to capitalize to something which teenagers will fall in love ,but afterwords will find out what silly they were.",2,2,5,26 May 2016
Mission: Impossible," With this Tom Cruise became an action star.
","Mission Impossible, just that ,the first of this franchise which took Tom Cruise of his dramatic roles and make him a believable action star and to say the truth is very well made and its scenes are so memorable that in every movie they have been redone and other movies have copy ,make a reference or parody them. So with the mission impossible six being announce and in pre production and with been twenty years after its release, I though it was high time to review this flick.To start does it hold up with the standards of the action movies nowadays? Yes, definitely and it is even better than a lot of them and even some superhero movies(superhero movies don't count as action flicks). The reason for that is not only it set the stage for spy movies to be more adrenaline fueled and give us spies who aren't just a copy of James Bond, but also it renewed the running man formula, that Harrison Ford made with the Indiana Jones, for real with so much running no wander why Tom Cruise look so young!One more thing is that the story isn't over the top but some what grounded in this world and so despite the lower stakes, the danger is more personal and show you get invested to the characters, who are also very well written and portrayed. In short although it hasn't the greatness of the Golden Eye, which came out one year earlier, I believe that it has a greater impact in cinema than this, just ask any regular film goer and he or she is more likely to have seen Mission Impossible than Golden Eye.Bonus fact the jokes for it are freaking hilarious like : ' Franchise Unkillable' ,'We will continue seeing sequel, up until Tom Cruise quiets', ' Cardio Cruising' and so on!! ha ha ha!In the end Ithan Hunt is a great alternative for James Bond( or even his son for as we know 007 had a weakness for women) and don't say thinks like 'Is just a copy of 007' for it isn't, like Bourne after words ,just continues the spy tradition and it doesn't make spies around the world feel shame for their work.",8,2,2,30 June 2016
Up," For anyone who says 'Animation can't be emotional' watch that!
","Up is by far the saddest Pixar film I have seen and I still wandering why it didn't get the Best Picture in 2009. Apart from the excellent animation, interesting story ,the opening is by far the most famous part of the film for it shows the life that our hero Carl Fredricksen had before he embark to his adventure towards the Paradise Falls.No spoilers for the opening minutes, but they were both beautiful, funny, sad and in the end tragic for our elderly man and after seen them you understand why he is grumpy all the time. Also at his great escaped, he is joined by Russell a plump ,joyfull boy-scout and they form one of the most mismatched duos in film history. And after-ward in the island they meet the talking dog Doug, I want him can we keep him?!!!As for the island itself ,is what your child-self would dream from an tropical island, vivid colors, huge trees and animals that you won't believe that really exist. This change in tone is done in a so amazing way that even Carl smiles! Also to our duo ,what I got, was that Carl saw his younger self to Russell and Russell got a father figure that was absent from the majority of his life. What a twist right? But how times in our life did we wished to happened to us and this was the best execution of that cliché I have seen.Over all I love Up and you should definitely watch show it with your kids, they are going to love it!",9,0,1,6 February 2017
Stalingrad," Cold ,War and Desperation
","Stalingrand of 1993 is among the many interpretations of this famous Battle of the Second World War and It is the best of them all. It has it all and it also quit accurate in portraying the fight around ,in and below the ground in the city as well as avoiding to glorify it ,but going directly to the meat of the case : The hell that it was and the suffering of the Soldiers in the front lines.As is the standard, the movie follows a platoon of German which is send to the city in order to help in the capture of the city and all of them soon release that this is not going to be walk in the park for the Soviet resistant is fierce and almost from the first minutes of combat you think 'The crew doesn't waste any time , they go straight to the front lines. Awesome'. The reason why I love this quick transition is that , from the title we all know what will happen and so we naturally expect to see the brutality of war and thankfully Joseph Vilsmaier ,the director, and his team also get that and their efforts are focused to make the fight intense, be accurate of the sake of the period and make the characters ,nice dudes, in order to care if they survive or die. You that feeling it is the same when you are watching Game of Thrones and we get that here ;).To focus on the accuracy of the film ,I was surprised for a lot of effort it was put in it and the costume ,the weapons and the setting is as close as it gets. For that to happen among the actors, the writers, the director's team and producers, it was also a military consultant in aid with the re-enactment. Man I like it when I see a film crew try it best to recreate a historical period and even if something goes south, you still will appreciate the final product due to the obvious effort ,which is put in it. Now as wrote before ,thet flick focuses on the struggles of a single platoon and its members, that focus works to the films favor for when you dealing with a historical subject ,is always better to start with something simple and fuse it in the era. Simply put make the story to fit the era and not the other way around. For although this film isn't a biography (so we can call a historical fiction!) the production, the story and the dialogues are made with the final goal to represent the battle of Stalingrand faithfully.Closing the film is definitely worth watching as a war film, history film and with a good amount of action, so it has the maximum appeal. And the 2013 Stalingrand is a abomination which puts shame to a fight which claim the lives of 1.5 to 2 million people.",9,1,2,6 February 2017
Reservoir Dogs," Quentin Tarantino opening work!
","A quarter of a century ago a young director and his friends came together in order to make a heist film, but he wanted to make it in an nontraditional faction.The result payed of and we know that film as Reservoir Dogs. The film though it is 25 years old still is as captivating, enjoyable and relabel as today, dispute the fact that many of it references in pop culture are now dated and forgotten.What made me like this film is that from its opening to the end credits ,we see the preparation, recruitment and outcome of the heist, so we know the needed information about our characters from their goals to their character. However the heist itself we only learn about it from your crew and so we can picture what happen ,what went wrong and the reason why trust has been thrown out the widow.To the references I mention that are dated, true there are but they are placed in the dialogues as a starting point for a conversation. This is what makes the dialogues real and sell the fact that these persons live in the real world ,for a decent percent of a conversation start with the phrases 'Have you watched the {movie B or film A}?' or 'Do you know this film/series?'. It feels natural because Tarantino had already understand that people remember what they have watched in a cinema or on TV (and today on-line) and it is a good measure to see if you can talk with someone or just sat up and wait until the group calls of today.Also the non-linear way the events are presented force the audience to picture themselves the causality of the story and so end on a conclusion by their own. That requires from the director to believe that his audience are willing to put their brains at work, which is so rear and often forgotten by many director/studios. Over all Reservoir Dogs is great and as first features films by a director go ,it is one of the best and as the opening shot for the Quentin Taratino Cinematic Universe is has a special place to the heart of any of Tarantino's work!",9,0,0,26 June 2017
Pulp Fiction," Quentine Tarantino best story arc ever.
","Pulp Fiction is not doubt one of the most interesting film ever made and has a devout following from around the world that has memorized every quote, scene and insult in it. To be fair the film has only one flaw at times it is a little slow, there is the only flaw that I found, you d**less pieces of s**ts. No let's talk in a more civilized way and you to the bathroom the take away the pressure.As for the story, better call them stories we follow two mob hit men, a boxer, a gangster's wife, and a pair of diner bandits as their activities are intertwine while they are doing their work, organize their crimes and generally continue their lives and then all goes to hell as they try to get out from their situations as quickly as possible. There is the summary in the movie for you.Now to the good stuff :The dialogues are funny, interesting, thought provoking and in a matter of minutes flesh out the character's ideals, philosophy and well character. This has become as stable of all Tarantino movie ever since Reservoir Dogs ,but here we see it become the awesomeness we all know and love.Secondary is the dark comedy in the film for we see murders, accidents and all kinds of criminal activities and yet we see it all played out as a day that work for out multiple protagonist. If you think about it, as plumier has got used to cleaning the excrement of our fellow humans and the smell has no affect on him ,it is the same thing.Last and not least is the time line of the events in the movie, which are like a broken puzzle and for decades fans have tried to put them in a chronological order. As for what Tarantino himself is thinking about the themes and time-line of the movie he said 'I will say nothing fan of the movie can theorize themselves what are them themes and ideals in the film ,why ruin their fun?'.In short every hypothesis (not theory of theories are confirmed by fault, sorry my science rand again(!)) about it are right so everyone can enjoy in his or her own way the flick.In summary Pulp Fiction is the film which together with L.A. Confidetial (1997), Leo the Professional (1994) and the Usual Suspects(1995),Seven (1005) and Fargo(1996) (always from my P.O.W.) brought the neo -noir sub-genre of cinema in the modern day audience. A much watch for every one in the end.",10,0,1,20 September 2016
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Volume 2 and still going strong :D.
","In to the second installment of the Guardian of the Galaxy our team meets Peter's Father ,Ego,Yondu faces issues with his crew and everyone is for a lack of a better word a brick ,even Baby Groot ,which was beyond adorable and up and right hilarious. In general as a sequel was on part with the first film, thought not all the jokes were on point and the soundtrack wasn't so memorable as with the first one.Over all the film had amazing visuals ,excellent computer animation and ,in all that ,we got a in-depth look in to the psychology of each character. And it was done in a funny, enjoyable and 'normal' way (we talking about a space film, with a talking raccoon, a living tree and gold aliens ,the term normal ,we have to take him with a grain of salt). To be more precise all the main characters (apart from Groot )face trauma due to their up bringing and this team ,these Guardians aren't just a team, is their closest to a family.But what I got of film is that all the misadventures of all the player in the film come out of their actions. They acted foolishly and got in to trouble, basically karma. And I can't forget the most outrageous Stan Lee cameo ever, it was funny to the point of tears.Over all I am unable to say more about the film since that would be to heavy of a spoiler and I don't want to spoil that flick for you, go watch in theaters as soon as possible.",9,9,16,10 May 2017
30 Days of Night," A nice twist on a known legend
","30 days of night to start, is a decant horror movie in its own right with great effects, acting and in general works as a movie for the vampires. To elaborate on that ,in modern-day vampires have lost their horror status, twilight and vampire dairies are to blame here no doubt that, and unlike them here vampires are depicted us hunters and humans are shows as more or less helpless against them. This is my reason why that movie is so good , because hits on the primal fear of the beasts that roam the world and when we try to fight back, we are powerless against them and what we know due to that, becomes useless, in short the summary of lovecraftian horror. If you love the horror movies and wish to see vampires get the respect the deserve go watch this forgotten gem.",8,1,2,13 March 2016
Army of Darkness," One of the most epic small budget films of all time!
","Army of Darkness is the final installment in the Evil Dead trilogy and it was the most successful of the team grossing 21.5 million dollars and has also the most jokes and slapstick moments of the three, but by no means it isn't bad. That is something I admire with this series, as the movie had more jokes and slapstick, they became also funnier and kept their quality while doing it. Another out come of this flick was that Bruce Campbell with his sarcastic, goofy and physical approach to his role, got the B-movie stardom and rightfully so, as for the director Sam Raimi well for his work about his work Sony decided that he would direct the Spiderman movie, nine years after the army of skeletons made their assault. In other words, no Army, no Spiderman and the Superhero genre we all know and love ,it wouldn't be as big as it is nowadays.To the flick itself, it stands alone pretty easily for it manages to contain in the first minutes all the story line of the previous film, so everyone has the needed knowledge to figure out what is happening. As for our protagonist, Asley (HAHAHAHAHAHAHA) he time-traveled in to the thirteenth century and as it is obvious he wants to go back. The scene though a bit cheap are close enough to the real deal in order to accept them and everyone will remember who Ash go the control of the castle, 'This is my Boom-stick!!', one of the most epic threats in movie history. And to the final battle of the garrison against the Army of the dead lead by the evil- half decomposed Ash!To make justice to the battle I have to write for it separately from the rest of my analyses for the film. It is a great stop motion work with the soldiers, which is also a pretty nice homage to the fight in Jason and the Argonants of 1963. The cinematography is on point ,so when something blows up is nicely done and doesn't get you out of the rest ,like with someone else( Bayhem). Finally to the comedy during the siege is on point always fit every event is in and the one of the best insults I have ever heard 'Baby you got really ugly' ,trully Bruce Campbell is the man.As for the ending ,it is known that are two of then, in the theatrical Ash return home and 'Hail to the king' and in the Raimi wanted to put ,he slept to much and he is now on a post-apocalyptic world. In all honesty the second fits with the tone of the movie better, but personally the first is more of my preference because ,Jesus Mr Williams has past from enough misadventure already and with it Ash vs Evil Dead could happen ,so bonus points to that.All in all is an awesome film and recommended to fun of horror , comedies , B- movies and anyone alive more or less ;). Have a good one and always remember the words Klaatu Barada Nicto, in any case you find yourself in a graveyard ;).",8,1,1,15 November 2016
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," It is a little better than the episodes 1 and 2, but to little to late.
","The Revenge of the Sith is the last of the prequel trilogy and it is a bit better from its predecessors. To its pros the opening start fight is nice, although I wise we could see more from what is happening, Palpatine's seems are OK, but lets be honest when he talks about how good is the Sith, it is like you say that the Nazis are not as bad as you think! My favorite part is the battle at the Wookie home planet of Kashyk and it is awesome to see clones and Wookies team up to break the droid attack and the final fight between Obi-one Kenobi and Gneral Grevous is fine. Also ,dispute its over stylized moves his duel with Anakin at Mustafa was fine and I enjoyed Anakin's slaughter of the Separatist leaders before the duel. But those are the only redeeming facts of that flick, because it suffers from the same problem as the previous installments ,like the stupid romance of Anakin and Padme, the inaction of the Jedi, who act only at the end when they are decimated almost to a man and truth to be tooled if they could not defend themselves even now, they had it coming. Continuing the CGI though better, the fact that you can see when the environment, means of transport or a character is real or not its a hint that they are still weak. All in all this is a fight which could be categorized as a guilty pleasure and if you see it with friend at a Friday night, it is going to be a fun experience ,but afterwords nothing is going to stick with you like with the Original Trilogy. So 6/10, but in truth, I would give a 6.5/10.",6,0,0,5 May 2016
Inception," What is a dream?
","Inception came out in 2010 and it is just amazing, Nolan truly made a modern masterpiece here for it is a inside to the nature of human brain and the way it makes scene of the reality. Nolan knows how to create a great scene and to integrate philosophy in it. He does it close to perfection and I may be bias ,but his works will be remembered for generations to come! Just see the legacy of the Dark Knight trilogy, Memento and Prestige for these flick are flicking awesome.The story here is like a heist movie married The Nightmare on Elm Street,had a kid, the kid when to university, studied the nature of the brain and learn martial art in order to be pitch perfect! Cobb, played by DiCaprio (why the academy didn't give him an Oscar then?), and his team are recruited in order to go inside the thoughts of the CEO of a colossus company and make him break the company, because it is too big of a danger for their employer ,played by Ken Whatanabe. Everyone plays terrifically for each person of the gang brings a different skill in to the mix and they make a crack team of dream intruders for the job.The effects are so awesome that your head will blow up like a melon been shoot by a machine gun! Every frame fills real ,but then you start thinking 'Are they inside a dream or not?' ,which make it even more awesome for when a movie tries to give philosophical messages ,it should give the audiences at times the room for them to make questions, then the interest for the plot will go throw the roof. Also the great set pieces and choreography help to make it a work of art! Bonus fact cgi wasn't a lot in the movie so when you see a shoot that seem impossible to be made by anything else but cgi ,is about 90% of the time practical effects! This because Nolan what's the stunts to fell real and it paid of!!If you haven't see it do it ,JUST DO IT. What in heaven world were you doing in the past six years, living under a rock or something? The fact alone that we still talk about this, should be enough of a reason to convince you to go watch it! Have a nice time doing it you will love it and if you a Nolan fun ,like me, you are definitely going to adore it. And after watching it Freddy won't be able to kill you in your dreams!",10,1,4,6 July 2016
WALL·E," Best sci-fi movie for kids
","Walle is a piece of art, I can't put it in other worlds apart of that, Pixar ,here, has created a new classic suited for our world ,who is based on scientific advancement, fears about the environment and how the future will be after wards.To add to that Walle is one of the cutest characters I have ever seen and his movie more than deserves the high rating it has. I remember very well when I went to cinema to see it with my school, is one of the few good memories I have from the years in junior high school. In summary, Walle is the cutest post-apocalyptic movie which has been made,is beautiful to watch and gives to the kids good lesson about the way we treat our planet, this blue dot in the sky to paraphrase Carl Seagan.",9,1,2,14 March 2016
Scream," What a surprise!!
","Scream is a good movie, more of that is a great meta-movie /parody of the slasher genre of horror ,which by 1996 ,when scream came out was in decline. West Craven here in a way made fun the main movies of his directorial history (like A Nightmare on Elm Street) and show us that even the most hardcore Filmer can be caught of guard. That is in a sense the story of Scream and fortunately Mr Craven and the actors made a great job pocking fun in the clichés of the horror movies we all know and either love or hate. To the point this flick was a sleeper hit and twenty years later has become the guideline of 'How to survive a horror movie'. Before I saw for the first time Scream ,I thought that it was overrated, after seen it it more than deserves the praise it gets. If I have to nit pick some thinks, is the fact that it is a bit dated for todays standards and the chill which once made people chill ,has been spoiled due to the low point in which horror movies are in modern-days. Note that it also had unnecessary sequels like the films it made fun of, what a irony!I am pretty sure that, horror movies will come back ,like the superheroes movies before them and Scream will be seen as a historic film ,like Phsyco(1960), Dracula(1930) ,Alien(1979), The Thing(1982) and the rest of the historic horror movies which even today we praise them as landmarks. It will come its time for sure.",8,4,4,18 April 2016
Wonder Woman," I was waiting for this film in years and it paid off!!
","Wonder Woman is one of the most iconic character from the comics and also one of the oldest ,been in adventures ever since 1940. To add to that, it was irritating to many, myself included, that from the trio of the Trinity of the Justice League ,Batman and Superman had already dozens of films and series dedicated to them ,but perhaps the most famous super-heroine in history lacked the same level of screen time ,until now!To the film itself, is the origins story of Diana for Themyscira to the trenches of the First World War, as she goes in order to end it as soon as possible. Accompanied her is Steve Roger eh Trevor who acts both as her guide and tutor for the world outside the domain of the Amazons. To the Princess of Themyscira herself Gal Gadot was excellent in her role not just playing but been this Amazon ,strong ,decisive, ready for fight at any time ,but at the same time showing how outside of the world she is, but always willing to learn new things for it ,from the nationalities to dancing(!). Chris Pine after finishing traveling around in the Enterprise, was the right mix of comedy and sidekick to Diana ,more or less reacting in a normal manner to these ex-ordinary events. To his credit ,we don't crash land in a island full of Amazons using swords, bows and arrows and wearing tunics everyday. And the support crew played their part and delivered with great quotes and well placed action and comedic wits!To the crew I glad that the men in the film weren't all of the douses (with the team of Trevor been the best example) ,unlike with previous women leading films. As for the actions ,godness was directed excellently and at any time I understood were each character was or what was doing. Over all what we want from Man of Steel ,Batman vs Superman and Suiside Squad ,it was fulfilled here. Ah and color ,a lot of color, made the watching so much more entertaining! And as for the setting ,I was worried how a 100% good character would be in a war in which wasn't any good or bad ,only gray and mud and morally questionable tactics. But my fears were subdued as the director's team find the solution and worked out in the end. However I have to say I have some nit-pitch. Firstly it seems to have 'borrowed' plot elements from Captain America the First Avenger, just saying. Some clichés weren't avoided, but were used cleverly I might say. But the biggest issues were the villains. In all honesty the antagonists were a bit generic (war-monder and mad scientist) and a small plot twist (no spoilers) which has become a bit of an issues to superhero movies for since Captain America the Winter Soldier we haven't seen yet a truly awesome villain. By the way they were quit inaccurate with the portrait of general Lunderdorf, but I am not to bug about it ,as this a superhero film not a historical one .Over all this one of the best origin story for a super-hero film and I proudly put it along side Kill Bill, Aliens, Terminator 2 and Mad Max Fury Road as great action film with females in the leading roles, girls this is the film you were waiting to add to that collection. Addictionally I am glad that women now have in public a symbol of feminism and fight to the rights of women , taking the big screen treatment!! And DC ,it took long enough.",9,6,15,10 June 2017
Carrie," How bullying and puberty affect a person.
","Carrie is one of the most iconic horror film in history and De Palma directing and shooting makes you understand everything by the images and cinematography ,how the characters feel, why they feel like that. The result is you can understand their actions through the film and their motivations, though at times a bit shallow, you can get why they do it. Also Brian De Palma shows very well the working of the senior high school students, from the unnamed hierarchy, to the cruelty the teens are capable off it goes with out saying if you had a difficult years in school you will sympathize with Carrie and even rude for her. An other thing worth mentioning is that the cruelty in house and at school can twist the way a person sees things and in the final scene of the infamous school dance we see that in a very realistic and disturbing manner. As for the subject of puberty is demonstrated by the telekinetic powers Carrie gains after her first Luteal phase. And gradually she starts to disobey her religiously fanatical mother, accepting complements as a good thing and even dancing with her cavalier. However there is and a dark side to that : she can now pretty easily hurt anyone how hurts her physically or emotionally and it is dangerous as innocent people may and do get in the cross fires.In general puberty is depicted like a new power coming out from the person and there two bad outcomes from it :When it isn't put in check becomes cruelty (seen in the girls bullying Carrie).The other possibility is when it comes in the hands of a person who was continuously bullied then the tables are turned and the hunted becomes the hunter, basically the quote of Nietzsche 'He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster. And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee.' becomes a reality ,just showing that the goodness and kindness how can be lost and even the most cruel maybe they do it just to get respect like in high school of instance.OK I will close mist analyses here for I may over did it. However this is a great adaptation of Steven King and perhaps the most faithful book-to-film take from all the films and series that have been based from his work so far ,together with the Green Mile, Misery and Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.",9,2,3,29 August 2017
The Iron Giant," If only Transformers were so good.
","Iron Giant is one of the movies ,which stick to me as a kid and now in my adult life I remember it finely. What really bothers me is the fact that this flick bombed at the box office, WHY? Did the Giant suffered enough already? Any way this is also one of the last hand drawn animated movies to be made before their type ,when close to extinct in the twenty first century. For just think how many animated flicks were in theaters(video movies don't count) in last decade and a half, which weren't made with computers, I am sure that three to five is the maximum number for most of us, for by experience know only five! FIVE, in Fifteen years !Now I don't for any reason hate Nemo, Toy Story ,WALL-E, Ice Age and Schrek, no are some of my favorites and Lego was hilarious. What I am saying is that Iron Giant apart from its great story, images and moments 'You stay ,I go, No following' ,man I still cry when I think of it, had also the 'luck ' to see its kind in its last days of glory, before Pixar and Dreamworks took over the industry. #MOLOPOLY!To the film itself ,at the high of the space race a robot from space crash land in the USA and befriends a boy, which teach it, who to be like superman. The effects are great and even the setting look accurate for the fifties period, why it earn 23 million to a budget of 70? The answers are ,the Six Sense which opened the same week, with the Giant and blew audiences away and the themes were judged by many parents as too adult. For real I feel go to an adult in the twenty first century and see an animated film and not be laugh at for that, in the end a good flick, is a good flick, end of story, because that argument of 1999 is obvious stupid!If you haven't show it to your kids yet, do it, JUST DO IT! Bonus if Micheal Bay had think of making the Tranformers ,more in line of this film the films would be so much better.",9,2,4,26 June 2016
X-Men: First Class," The mutants are back!!
","X-men First Class came out in 2011 and it is a reboot-prequel of the original trilogy who end with the Last Stand ( what a dumb movie) and it is awesome . Until I see X-men Apocalypse I will review the installments of this franchise which with this flick came back from the dead!! To the film itself ,is set in the sixties during the Cuban Missile Crisis and we meet the younger versions of Magneto, Professor X, Mystique and Beast, who try to stop the World War III for happening. To the cast everyone plays his or her role close to excellent with James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender stealing the show.What I liked was that they both want the best for their mutant brothers and sisters but the means they prefer are as far as it get ,dispute that their friendship is totally real. Bonus fact Fassbender is the better Magneto than Mackellen and I stand to my view!! To the rest Jennifer Lawrence ,before becoming Katniss ,plays Mystique and she rocks, you totally believe that she wants nothing more than to fill part of a bigger team ,the same goes for the Beast, who is my favorite character of the X-men since I can remember myself and his depiction here redeemed the character from his first appearance in the Last Stand. The only character that felt a little shallow were the team of the villain of the story, apart from Kevin Bacon who was the epitome of an arrogant, mad scientist,but it was not so bad to break the movie.Now to the theme, because every superhero no matter who great ,over the top or Strange( for Dr Strange :)) he or she is has a theme ,which is the fuel for the actions that they do. Spiderman's is responsibility ,Batman's is justice, Punisher's is vengeance and so on. To the X-men the theme is as I previously wrote to find somewhere to belong and face the racism of the rest of the society because of their powers. And here we get it and then some ,with Magneto been the Malcom X and Professor been the Martin Luther King of this universe and in the end their view are both right!! ( Although personally team Magneto) In summary the movie is great and its only weaknesses , which to find you must nit pick, it is the the villains ,except from the leader and their plan .But its strong parts is the rest characters , the action, the setting ( in 1963 the first X-men comic was published so they literally return back to the basic) and the alternate history from our own ,which the creators of the movie made. I like it due to it answer indirectly a big question ,what would the world today be like if heroes like that of the myths walk among us!!A thing of Beauty!! You should definitely see it if you have not already.",9,1,1,15 June 2016
The Wolverine," Better than Origins ,but not the best in the X-men.
","Wolverine the movie is the second solo flick featuring the fan favorite mutant and for starters is better than Origins ,but this does not say much because Origins is in every top ten of the worst superhero movies in history. The interesting think is that is set in Japan and seeing Logan in this place where fighting and honor ,due to the code of the Samurai, Bushido, is one and the same ,is quite cool.As for the time line, is after the Last Stand and before Days of Futrue Past.Here we see Logan having lost his willingness to continue existing ,after the events of the Last Stand. It is made clear that his ability to regenerate from any injury and slow aging are curse as he sees it. To give you an idea as the movie is set in 2013 ,then Logan must be around 130 years old at least!! So when a Japanese scientist says to him that he can take away his abilities, then he is going for it. And here is the movie's major plot hole, his abilities, unlike the adamantium ,are not put in to him ,but are part of his genes ,so telling him that can take away his powers is like saying to a blonde that you can take away the gene that make his or her hair blonde, scientifically impossible. Nevertheless for the sake of the story it happens and a little time after the action starts and the fight scenes rock!!! Their are some of the most entertaining action scene I have seen. In the same time we watch as Wolverine regains his attitude that makes his character famous and you fill good for him. And now for the ending ,to tell the truth is a bit underwhelming and most of secondary character are not very interesting, but as the story went they were OK?!In summary is Wolverine good ,yes ,great ,no ,better than Origins or the Last Stand ,totally man. So why in the Helmet of Magneto has a lower score than either?? Anyway you will have fun see it and as far as solo Wolverine movies go ,if the following in 2017 continue this way then it will be a nice send of for Hugh Jackman as this character. I think a lot of people will feel sad when this happens, me included.",7,0,0,16 June 2016
The Dark Knight Rises," Excellent Clossure to one of the greatest trilogies ever!
","Dark Knight Risese is the closing chapter to the Dark Knight trilogy and as for third installments go is pretty good to say the least and fitting to to be honest. Now I am aware the plot holes and some issues that the film has ,but these are minor thing and can break a film if the whole of the final product isn't go enough and I had to watch four times in order to find out the issues, this because the movie itself is perfect!The story takes place eight years after the events of the Dark Knight and we see that Bruce has since then retired from crime fighting ,but when Bane comes out ,he must put the cowl one more time. What I like about Bane is that he is the only villain in the feature films even that is equal if not superior in strength from the Dark Knight and add that he has a good strategic mind, he is a force to be reckoned with! Also Catwoman is in the film and Anne Hathaway is the best Catwoman we have so far in the big screen, she is sexy, agile and with a lot of fines, this what as Catwoman be and see portraits it perfectly. And he suit... is the kid that fan-boys (for the most of part!) dreamed of!As for the comics the flick takes elements from are of course the Dark Knight Returns, No Man's Land and Knightfall (for hardcore DC fan you know what is coming! no spoilers). Although Batman is less in that film in comparison with the previous ,with a run-time of two hours and forty five minutes, the longest in the trilogy (Batman Begins was two hours and twenty minutes and Dark Knight two and half hours), we still get a lot of him. But the time we don't see him we see the legacy that his action have left on Gotham and to the peoples in it. Awesome!In conclusion the flick rocks, the ending rocks and this trilogy rocks! Highly recommended to EVERYONE. Also Christian Bale, still the best Batman ,sorry Ben Afflect. And to me personally the film gets a 10 out of 10!",10,1,4,1 August 2016
Iron Man," Marvel Cinematic Universe starting Point.
","In honor of the release of Dr. Strangle in the next October, I will review the first play boy arrogant human in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Antony Edward Stark aka Iron Man. What is to said about this billion-er Playboy Philanthropised that it hasn't said before but anyway this is my review and here we go.Before the 2008 theatrical appearance, Iron Man was consider a B-level hero, unlike Spiderman and the X-men, so he didn't had any big fan base, with the majority knowing him by the Spiderman series of 1993 and his own solo series which isn't the best animated series to say the truth. The reason why the newly found (back in 2004) Marvel Studio started making his movie was that he ,like the rest of his nowadays fellow Avengers were the only characters the Studio afford to buy off. So here is the know well known story why the movie was made.To the movie's story: After his captivity by rebels in Afghanistan ,the billion-er,genius, engineer Tony Stark has a change of heart (literaly) and he designs an armored suit in order to fight crime. What makes the movie as awesome as it is, is Robert Downey Jr. portrait that perfectly shows how an arrogant man deals with the realization that his action do more harm than good in the world and he turns around in order to redeem himself. To be fair and the rest of the cast are good but Downey steals the show. And the reason for that is, he had only to play himself as he had hit rock bottom with drugs a few years before the movie and that film was his come back. Wow!The other major thing that defined the future of the MCU was the tone. Though it has its darker moments the movie is pretty colorful, funny and exciting, in short you want to watch over and over again. And here is when a perfect storm of greatness began ,for after it, the rest of the Avengers start popping out like Hulk, Captain America ,Black Widow, Hawkeye and Thor and conclude with the amazing film that is the Avengers(2012). To be more clear if this movie sucked then probably the superhero genre wouldn't be as big as it is now. And to be real between 2005 and 2009 the comic book movies( including the superheroes) especially the Marvel ones were in a decline.This was because they either try to copy the Batman Begins tone and end up lame or just not as great as they could be (see Elektra(2005),Constantine(2005), Spiderman 3(2007), Spirit (2008) and Watchmen (2009)( to be fair it was OK) etc.) or just the studio run out of ideas and made a piece of junk (X-men the last stand, Fantastic four ,Fantastic Four 2 and the Ghost Rider movies etc.) so when Ironman came out start to change the tide and making way for the MCU and even the newest X-men films to bring our modern mythology back to the spotlight.In the end ,Iron Man is a great film and one of my favorites superhero movies and MCU films even to this day.",9,0,1,20 September 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A good-looking messy film in the end
","I am a big fan-boy,I have being waiting this movies for about 2 years, when I realized that it was not a joke. So my expectations were really high because, Batman V Superman guys who wouldn't be about that. And now let's go to the real deal,is it good? To put as simple as possible, comrades of the superheroes it is not what we wanted neither what what we need it, but I believe it will earn its money back and more, because it is at least a decent blockbuster. Whoever as a fan-boy I was not very pleased with the final product as my 6/10 proves.Now If anyone is going to say that I should not be so excited, then he or she is a fool, for one simple reason, BATMAN VS SUPERMAN, What you don't understand? And the main issue: As far as I understand Snyder tried to make this movie the starting point for all the DC cinematic universe ,like with Ironman in 2008 for the MCU.But he did not do it very well and this movie felt a bit rushed.To the pros of the flick Ben Afflect was a good Batman ,as Herny Cavill for Superman and Gal Gadot for Wonder Woman and Jeremy Irons as Alfred were well made casting choices. Also the fight scenes,especially with Batman were good and entertaining. If you are hipped with this movie then you are going to be disappointed as I am a bit myself. But to everyone: it is not a bad movie, it is just a enjoyable action flick with good casting and nothing more, although as a friend of mine said to me about a year ago , a movie were just Batman meets Wonder Woman would be awesome and I agree by seen this movie. Bonus fact ,it could be easier to focus with just two main characters, just saying. In summary here we have an example with a movie which try too hard to set the ground for following flicks and forgot to be more centered to its main story, although it could be better, Dawn of Justice ,at least , was not a simple cash cow.",6,1,2,26 March 2016
Toy Story 3," The first billion dollar animated movie.
","When Toy Story 3 came out on cinema ,I was a teenager and I was thinking I was well over the kids films and cartoons( I though anything animated the fool) and when this movie came out ,I was put in charge to keep an eye to my younger sister and a friend of hers, when we went to the cinema. So I had the idea that I would be just job for the older Brother. Then I saw the movie and it was glorious! When I came out of theater ,I was thinking' this isn't just a kids film ,it is a work of art which everyone can enjoy!'The story continues the ark of the previous flicks. Now Andy is going to go to College and the Toys are anxious with that, for the purpose of a toy is to be played so what's their goal now? After wards, they are send mistakenly to a day-care center (the original goal was to go to the attic) ,where they think that all the problems are fixed, but things aren't always as they look like and its up to one of the best Cowboys of all of fiction, to bring his family back home. Apart from its beautiful animation, relatable characters and solid story, the closing chapter of this trilogy deals with the deepest themes of them all, abandonment and what to do when your purpose (you can also say career) is done, for it is hard to continue when the base of your living ends! That theme is the most adult of the trilogy ,for everyone from senior students to hard working adults are afraid of they can't keep up with their job or even worst their area of expertise in now unnecessary (which means their skills are also needless). For real when I gave my exams for go to university I was thinking just that message and when School is finally over what I should for in Greece it is a common say that when a person goes to university has a hard time keep up with the demanding program there. Likely I adapt quickly ,but it was hard and that movie gave me that lesson better than all of my school teacher!Now I have already wrote the amazing facts about Toy Story 1 and 2 ,with 1 been the very first full-length movie with computer generated images and 2 to be at first planed to go direct to video! So, in my point of view, seems right to give a great fact about 3 also. Toy Story 3 is the first animated film to be A BILLION DOLLAR MOVIE! For real it grossed a total of 1,063,171,911 $ world wide. That number wasn't unheard of in twenty ten ,but it never happened with an animated film, to put it simple ,the massive success of Minions, Frozen, Zootopia (all of them grossed over 1 billion) ,wouldn't be possible if Toy Story 3 didn't create that opening.In short this flick is a future classic and its legacy ,like with the rest of this amazing trilogy, I hope to be continued with the four installment, which will come out in 2018. Fingers crossed!",9,0,1,22 July 2016
X2: X-Men United," The best of the original X-men trilogy
","X2 is easily the best of the original X-men trilogy. OK to be better from the Last Stand does not mean much, but from the first X-men which was consider before 2002 one of the best superhero movie is saying something. Also what makes it, in my point of view ones of the best comic book movies, is the fact that unlike the other two of the trilogy, even today with much better superhero flicks ,like the Dark Knight trilogy and the MCU still holds up and can stand in, at least, decent terms with this two mega-blockbuster-Francaise. To write down now about the flick itself, the plot is amazing ,the action is well executed and the characters here are even more likable than its predecessor. For example the best aspects is the fact that Wolverine here has to make a choice about him as a person and the older students by the end have become part of the team. Those 2 story lines perfectly capture the essence of the X-men, which are the fight for human rights and though diversity and straggle a group of people becomes more than a team,they become a family. All in all it is a great film and has aged really well. Just for the record I wrote this review in order to get all as many users of IMDb excited for the X-men Acocalypse ,which will come out this spring. Fingers crossed ,I believe that the director and the actors will justify us with a great finale of that trilogy.",8,0,0,16 April 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The right order to watch Star Wars: 4, 5, 6 and 7
","The Force Awakens was relished during the last Christmas( of 2015) and it is the continuation of the saga after the Return of the Jedi.So is it good? Better from the prequels ?Even with the Originals? The short answers are yes ,wow surely man ,to become as good as the originals it will take time. In more details is an awesome flick and the fact you do not know what will happen ,like with the prequels ,is a great because it is a New Start(pun intended :) )so the saga comes back tall, proud and strong. As for comparing it with the prequels ,they do not even stand a chance, the story ,the effects ,the fighting both on the air/ space and on the ground are super and the character have already gain fun and I am included to this group. Now against the Original trilogy is not the landmark of the New Hope or Empire Strikes Back is more in the level of the Return of the Jedi and I believe that 5 or 10 years from now will gain a status among the audiences and whatever problems ,it may have, are going to become a part that will make stronger, like the jokes for Batman voice from the Dark Knight trilogy. Simple put Star Wars is back and if everything go well it is going to stay here for long. Strong is it with the Force.",9,4,23,6 May 2016
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A landmark of the cinema-history
","In honor of May,the official Star Wars month, I will review all the Star Wars movies in chronological order. Now lets start with the New Hope: It opened on May 1977 and after that the world as a whole changed big time. This movie is even studied as the archetype of the hero journey and made the words like ,lightsabers, the Force, Jedi and names like Lya ,Luke , Han Solo and of course Darth Vader known world wide.Every science fiction flick or TV series after 1977 is in, one way or an order, a child ,godchild or imitator of Star Wars. From Guardians of the Galaxy to Rick and Morty and almost anything in between. The impact can be seen in movies or series from totally different genres, for instance due to its success studios decided to invest in the superhero stories that inspire George Lucas to create this unforgettable saga and from that it came Richard Donner's Superman ,Tim Burton's Batman and the 1992 X-men series and Batman the animated series ,which are the fathers (spoilers) of the superhero genre ,which now dominates Hollywood. In simple ,no Star Wars, no Superheroes!! If you have not watch it ,I feel sorry for you and go do it now!!",10,1,1,3 May 2016
Deadpool," A real thrill and extreme funny
","Deadpool , it is the first of eight comic book movies ,whose will come out in this year (2016). It is part of the x-men Francaise which had its ups and downs over the years. Deadpool to summaries is the best meta movie I've seen for a long time and makes justice to the character of Deadpool, as well as the superhero movies as a whole. The movie is full with gore , fun ,excellent fourth wall breaks (even one sixteen wall break) and the meta-humor was perfectly in mod with the today world. By far this movie open this year superhero movies with an explosion and silences all the haters who talk about superhero fatigue (go talk you fools about young adults movie fatigue). To conclude go to watch Deadpool ,you will not be disappointed like with him previous incarnation,who everyone wants to forget.",10,6,19,28 February 2016
300," Faithfullness to the comics ,but not to the actual History, yet still awesome.
","More than a decade after this film hit the scenes ,people still use the phrase 'This is Sparta' to sound more intimidating and awesome and many men started working out in order to take the look of the Spartans in the film. Now this doesn't mitigate the fact that the flick is full of inaccuracies based on the battle, the look and the armor used back then.However I still like quit a lot this film ,dispute these HUGE inaccuracies for the fact that the film tries to be faithful the the comic of Frank Muller and not the actual event and the producers, acting crew and stuff in general knew that and didn't try to be historically correct, they just work to make a good action film and honor the myth of one of the most epic Last Stands in history and they succeed, plain and simple.As for the battle itself it is awesome and enjoyable like the rest of the film. Also while in scenery and look they failed ,they manage to get right surprisingly much more thing than someone would expect and I highly encourage you to investigate it then yourselves and then re-watch the film, then you will think 'Boy I didn't expect to get right that one'.If I have some beef with the film is with its slow-motion style which was overused afterwards by many action-flick and made a laughing stock and Zack Znyder for with this film Warner Brothers decided to make him the chief mind for the DCEU and from that we got a mediocre Man of Steel ,a disappointing Batman vs Superman and the Suiside Squad a superhero team ,with zero commodore and honest the second worst team up since 2015 Fantastic Four. Honesty my issues aren't with product ,but with the team behind it.Over all an awesome action film and to everyone who dislikes the matzo Spartan, one 'This is Sparta' ,two really (?) you hate them because they are more fit than you that's low and pity-full.",8,1,5,10 April 2017
Kingsman: The Secret Service," My favorite spy movie of 2014
","Kingsman , follows an elite team of spies appointed in order to stop crisis around the world and the recruitment in to their ranks of Exjy ,who as all hero journey go becomes awesome and kicks ass. This time the villain that the agency has to stop is Samuel E, Jackshon ,who is a billionaire Eco-terrorist who has as goal to kill a respectable present of the world population, something like the Nick Fury turns bad and he is hilarious!As for the action, is extreme well choreograph, the stunts, the gore, the kills are so well make that is like the comic book ,tha this series is based came to life. What I loved was that all these agents, huntsmen (and women) are in love with spy movies and they brag about it. Everyone from Austin Power to Borne and the granddaddy of them all (possible that is true;)) James Bond are mentioned both as role model and poking fun to some of the plots holes that they have in their stories.The dialogues are also very well written (I suspect Tarantino has put his hands in to that) and the changing between the polite British tone and the ripped fire cursing made me laugh my ass off. The great result must be from the fact that everyone must had a blush working their and it was apparent to the way the characters were reacting to their environment (bonus fact to work their ,you could work beside Mark Hamil himself!).In the end is a enjoyable spy film ,with elements of spoof films of old and I recommended to all, just make sure that in the company you don't have a person with a wick stomach, did I mention the gore? Yes ,I did so do squirms people aloud!",9,16,26,26 June 2016
Ran," The Japanishe version of King Lear.
","Akira Kurosawa is among the most respected directors and writers of posrt-WW2 Japan with many of his films been consider as classics and Ran, which in Japanese means chaos is one of them and one of his last work. What I like is the fact that Mr. Kurosawa took inspiration of one of Shakespeare plays, King Lear to be precise and fused it with a historical figure of that era the daimyō Mōri Motonari, but the main plot is more or less the same with King's Lear.So during the Warring State Period of Japan we meet Hidetora Ichimonji a elderly warlord who seen that he is at the end of his life he gather his three sons and divides the area among them but he with retain the title of Lord. For that his youngest son ,Saburo fiercely disagrees with that plan and tells it immediately to his father that his plan is flawed. But Hidetora has none of it and banish him and gives the first castle to his eldest son Taro and the rest two to his second, Jiro. And as it is obvious by the inspiration of king Lear the two brothers treat their father poorly to a point he is reduce to a beggar!And at the same time Jiro seems to overthrow his brother, while Saburo with his allies later master a big army in order to pressure the rest two Ichimonji to take Father under his protection. In the end all of the House of Ichimonji is dead, their main castle is soon to be destroyed and the once prosperous realm is in ruins.Now to the characters for some of them are quit intrigue. I will start with the Ichimonji and then analyses some of their peripheral allies and antagonists. For starter Hiderota while he at first is in peace, he can't see that the brutal method which he used in order to take power have left a lot of grudges against his house and that his sons aren't as united as things. As for his first-born he is an oaf under the control of his wife Lady Kaede, whose castle was the now First castle and in the process her whole family was murdered in the night of her wedding (I guess the George R.R. Martin may took some inspirations) and she has one goal: to stay in her castle and keep it all cost, so she forces Taro to banish his Father and later after Taro is secretly assassinated by a trusted man of is brother Jiro during the siege of their Father's men in the abandoned Third castle, so to look like normal, she seduces Jiro.As for Jiro he is the Petyr Baelish family and he makes plans to take down his brother for him to be the next ruler of the clan, from this actions he seems to be angry that though smarter and better leader from his older brother he never got the recognition he deserved ,but when he becomes the ruler after his brother death he is practically a pawn against Kaede,who is leagues more manipulating than him and in the end she is one of the reasons the Ichimonji fell. As for Saburo he is blunt but not mean ,headstrong but not an idiot, in general he should be the next ruler, but it wasn't meet to be. For closing it will writer about my favorite secondary character,the right hand man of Jiro,Kurogane, although he has the dirty job for his lord ,he is totally realistic and when war is up on them, he is the only person who wants to find a solution with a peaceful way and also the only who see that his lord is 'under the spells' of the recent widow of his brother.As for the fighting, is fast, devastating and 100% historically accurate. What I loved is the impact of the early firearm arquebus has for it kills two of the brothers ,Taro in a way to hide a treason and Saburo to deprive him of his victory. Also during the decisive battle of the dominion of the Ichimonji's state the firearm ,turn the table on the bigger Jiro's army who uses just mass attack of infantry and chavarly , but Saburo's troops, dag in the woods and every time the larger army comes to them is slaughtered. This is also true for the period, the introduction of firearms during the second half of the Waring period changed the way Wars were won and lost. Kurosaga intentionally shows firearm like that to make parallels with the atom bomb, the War changed and everyone who didn't not follow then new rules can't survive.All in all is an epic of a film, which though a bit slow it worth your time and gives plenty food for though and analyses of the psychology, war and the hobbesian world of that treason and violence create.",10,0,2,4 January 2017
Apollo 13," Houston we have a great film!
","It has been almost half a century after we have stepped on to an other celestial body apart from Earth and in Honor of this achievement I am going to review the best movie about these missions Apollo 13 ,which dispute that it is more than two decades old still pack a powerful punch of emotions, characters and a tribute to the resourcefulness, ingenuity and traveling spirit of our species as a whole.So the film follows the NASA team of the mission 13, who after a disastrous malfunction ,the crew on the spacecraft is in a dire situation and so the man on the ground and on the space-capsule must find out a way to return the crew safely back home. If you know basic space-race history then you already know that the team return alive to Earth and they even gave advice to the actors and production ,like the rest of NASA in order to help the directing team to make the film as authentic as possible and over all they did it.Now granted many of the sense are dramatized and some arguments are put it to mix to create tension in the story and show the how hazardous was the position of our team. But in reality both the crew and the NASA team on the ground were as calm as it gets, no joke I saw the original recordings and the tone of the voice was CASUAL. That is a testament to the professionalism of the NASA personnel, even in the worst case scenario they kept calm and gave the 100%. Now that doesn't diminish the quality of the film, on the contrary it strengthens it for shows how the artistic liberty should be done, with elegance and showing the humanity behind an event, which is exactly what happened with that film. Wow and the astronauts ,I am 200% sure, that posses balls of steel!Also many dialogues are a bit simple, which they would never be in that way, but let'd be honest 99 out 100 people aren't trained to be in NASA so that was also a logical move from the director and writers part.As for the acting, the visuals ex-ordinary and for the later to get the best possible sense of weightlessness of space they used an airplane known as 'the vomit-comet' to make them pitch perfect and they got it. To return to the crew Tom Hanks rocks, Kevin Bacon rocks and Ed Harris surprised me because he usually took part in action films not in serious biographies, but still he rocked as the rest of the team, a truly dream team, out of this world! ;)All in all I love that flick and makes me sad the fact that when those events happened there were so many ideas for the future and despite the fact that technologically we have made a lot of progress, the real deal, space odysseys to encounter strange new world and perhaps there wonderful inhabitants, it hasn't become a reality yet.",9,0,1,27 January 2017
Fantastic Four," Honestly we had to figure it out that Fantastic 4 can't do it.
","This is the second film of the ground zero for the super-hero teams and the first proper film ,released in cinemas, which marketing and all that good stuff, unlike the 1994 attempt. But unfortunately this film is boring as hell ,the characters are paper thin, the effects are laughable and the final battle is anticlimactic. That is the basic summary of this film.Dispute that I will give them graded for the incarnation of the Thing and the dynamic between him and the Captain America, hum, I mean the Human Torch. Now that I think about it, Marvel Studios did make a risky investment to Chris Evans back in 2011, if you take in to account that his previous attempts in a super-hero film were this film and its sequel which is equally lack-last-er.Aw and one of the best cameo from Stan'The Man' Lee! That's all.Apart these two good things the film is a let down and I think that we had to figure out from them that maybe Fantastic Four can't become a film franchise. Which is both sad and ironic, they were the very first super-hero team back in 1961 and in two decades of tries and Fox has failed four times in the row and don't get we started with Fan4stic!Now to go to why they failed both with this one and its sequel is that they didn't try to em-praise the science fiction part of the Fantastic Four. Why to leave that out? Since their inception this team is all about alien civilizations, planet-consuming entities, mad scientist and they have Doctor Flipping Doom ,one of the most awesome villains of all time. Why to make a semi-romantic comedy drama and with the 2015 they went the other way around. Edgy, greedy and anxiety ,but in the end they did the same plots more or less with the first three films. Then Fox should have sold the rights back to Marvel and cut their losses.Over all I have my doubt that we will see a decent Fantastic Four film any time soon. In all honesty that angers me to the full. I am ,at the time of this recording, 21 years old and I have seen Spiderman, Batman, the X-men, Hellboy, V from Vendeta, Sin City, Superman and of course the crew of the Avengers get good films in my life-time, why it can't happen with Fantastic 4 to?",5,1,3,30 April 2017
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," One of the best movies ,period!
","Empire Strikes Back is no doubt one of the best movies in history. Just everything in here was better of the previous installment. Action, suspense, fights, romance( very easy to became a dumb romantic- comedy, but not in here my friends) and it has, if not the best ,one of the best plot twist at the end no spoilers, but you know for what I am writing about. If I could give it 11 /10 ,I would but ,that it might created problem in the IMDb system ,so 10/ 10 is good enough. It is said that like the New Hope, the production of the Empire had a ton of issues, for example Carry Fisher was high on cocaine during all of the shootings of the movie and the majority of the crew was not in more clear state of mind ,if you know what I mean. Fortunately the Force was strong and the movie was excellent, which by itself that fact considering the production problems is a miracle. I love this flick and as a very picky person ( not in food anyway) I want the best possible and here I got it, I highly recommended it for watching immediately. May the Force be with you!",10,1,2,3 May 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," What a lovely movie indeed!!
","Mad Max Fury Road is the fourth of the Mad Max franchise and it had been 30 years after the last Mad Max movie and that was Beyond Thuderdome, which was not the greatest closing chapter for the original trilogy (although if you want to find a movie to become your guilty pleasure is a great choice). When I saw it ,it blew me away with its effects, which were for the 90% of the time real and not CGI, the combat on the cars : Gladiator meets Fast and the Furious ,only it is better than any Fast and the Furious. Also the characters are hardcore madmen or women, who fit perfectly in a environment like that. My favorite is Furiose ,which is a Amazon through and through, well done Charlize Theron, you are awesome. The story is ,to tell the truth, very simplistic though that to the flick advantage in order to give space for the action to be as epic as possible, and it paid of big time. In truth George Muller create the best action movie of the decade and we are only half way through! To add to that dispute its adrenaline and gasoline fueled madness, this movie ,which maybe be the most macho movie of the 2015 has an environmentalist and feminist message to give. George Muller how did you and your team did that?! In the end I had a blast seen it and I recommended to you with closed eyes.",9,1,9,6 May 2016
Gladiator," Historical accuracy not much, but an amazing project non the less.
","With Gladiator be now about half of a generation old I though it was time to review this great flick and the impact to the movies in general. As it is quit known it is a fictionalize as Game of Thrones ,but unlike many historical movies that doesn't bother me much for this flick literally brought the interest for the classical world and let's face it the movie is *beeping* awesome and from the setting alone it is shown the huge work it was put into the project.The story is center to the Roman General Maximus Desimus Marinious ,who after the Emperor Commodus ascends the throne ,he is betray by him and now he has only one goal in life, to kill Commodus himself! The great think it is that though heavily fictionalized the characters ideals and way of thinking is compatible with what Romans had as base for their behavior. They performance although, which are all great don't harm the either! My only small complain is that the gladiatorial fights aren't very accurate (but are awesome) ,dispite that what saves them from criticism is the big budget which make the spectacle nothing short of wow inspiring.Now to the main subject of this review, the increase of mainstream audience for the classical era. When Gladiator came out ,the common people wasn't very kin in Classical history and often dismissed it and studios also didn't give much interest to the sword and sandal genre thinking of it a think of the past. Then this flick made 457,6 million dollars world wide and won five Oscars ,so after EVERYONE wanted a piece of the pie. This renew interest brought us HBO Rome, Spartacus: Blood and Sand, 300 and so on. Now it also borough and awful creations like Gods of Egypt, the remake of Ben-Hur and some more, but if this the price for the people to get started in learning history so be it.Over all I have a soft spot for this film and it truly make me go find out more about the people who ones lived and their actions, tragedies and greatest achievements. Like it or not Gladiator make history mainstream in the pop culture.",9,0,0,1 July 2016
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," How to make a good sequel of Indiana Jones, put James Bond in it!
","Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is the closing chapter of the Indianna Jones TRILOGY ( Crystal Skull doesn't could) and it is my favorite of the three ,what it has and makes it a bit better than the two previous flick is Jones father ,played by Sean Connery which is funny as hell and an amazing sidekick to his son. We also have Nazis again in order to see these bastards get what they deserve, street justice!The plot is a bit similar to the first movie ,Indi is task by a business man to find the Holy Grail and prevent the Third Reich from acquiring it and use it to conquer the world, what did you expect these are the same people who wanted to create a master race of humans! During this quest Jones meet and teams up with his father Herny Jones Senior ( the real name of Indi is Herny Jones Junior) and the make a good duo.The action is always to a Indiana film great with awesome stunts , gripping fighting scene and some slapstick humour here and here to light up the atmosphere in order to the audience time to relax for to much drama it is a thing and can make a viewer bored. What I also like to Indiana Jones films and we get the in the Last Crudaser, is that much of the sets are historical places and you always get a bit of the history of the place ,just a bit to make you go look for it! I for real think that this was done on purpose in order to learn the viewer some history ,thank Steve ,you are great!In conclusion if the Indiana Jones film had stopped i=to the last Crusade the we would have one of the most awesome trilogies in cinema history, but then 2008 came ,I have nothing to write now for this flick ,but its time will come. For the Last Crsade just go watch NOW!",9,0,0,16 July 2016
Valkyrie," A real life conspiracy.
","Valkyrie is the story of a team of German officers during WW2, who after fearing for the progress of the war, they make a plan in order to assassinate Hitler ,seize power and then make peace with the advancing allied forces. When I was in my teens I really loved that movie for I had a major crash with anything related to history, after I though that it didn't worth and now I see as a quit accurate adaptations of this real life conspiracy, which not many people know it.As for casting, the actors were extremely similar to their counterparts, with Tom Cruise seeming to be a twin to Claus Von Staufebenrf, the protagonist and main character to the flick. The cinematography is amazing and the sets are as accurate as they get, what do you expect Bryan Signer of the X-men directed it. But anyway as all we know basic history is it obvious what was the result of the conspiracy.Man I think that if they had Eric Lenscher (Magneto) with them things would have been different.;)Now there are some inaccuracies here and there and some thinks that were changed but over all the crew tried to be as authentic as possible and be faithful to the history and the did it. When you adapt a story from a novel ,a comic book, a historical event it is impossible to be 100% accurate, some changes for production sake and keeping the run time in reasonable length, but the most important think is the film present to the audience the main facts and present them as close to reality as that is possible. Here that is a bit easier for the story is focus mainly in Germany and the whole story is started in March 1943 and ended in July 1944. The last part is crucial for may saved the movie from becoming like Alexander of Oliver Stone or Bayhem Pearl Harbor. It focuses in one story of a bigger period and didn't try to make it as complex as possible but as good as it could be. Just think the most well known and praised WW2 movies, like some my favorites Saving Private Ryan, Letters from Iwo Jima, Das Boot, the Great Escape, the Downfall, the Pianist and Schindler's list. All focused in one in event of character and play the story as it went and showed the way the people reacted. This way is more easy, it helps the audience to relate to the characters and it can then focus to make the settings and costume accurate.As conspiracies shown in movies go this is one of the best , because it is grounded to reality and simple in order everyone to get the bigger picture. That is how conspiracies are made, not with absurd complicated traps and goal. For real it is impossible 9/11 and similar conspiracies to be true because are so absurd that Willie Cody will come and say :'that's stupid' !",8,0,1,1 July 2016
Evil Dead II," Remake/Sequel with horror and comedy together!
","Though the movie is called Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn it is more a remake of the 1982 flick and was obvious that it would be a different creature from its predecessor. But firstly it is as good if not better than the 1981 with improved effects and better acting. That was expected fro it had a budget of 3.5 millions and up to now both Raimi and Campbell had more experience in the movie making process.So what it is so better with the Dead by Dawn?To begin,as mentioned then practical effects are amazing, are on par with other well known,for their practical effects, eighties movie like the Thing (1982), the Indianna Jones Trilogy (kingdom doesn't count) and the Fly (1986). They both spooky and interesting to watch which is what you want if you are making a flick about demons. Groovy!Secondary the movie has something that was missing from the original flick, a lore. You get to know why the demons attack our crow, from where are they coming from and a prophecy for if you make a fantasy world why don't ,if done right, put also a prophecy. And side note with that flick the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis, the Book of the Dead, became famous and out side from the Lovecraft work and made more people interested to reading his work, pretty neat ,I think!Thirdly the movie fused horror and slapstick comedy with great efficiency. This fact alone made it ,for me at least better than the previous installment which was a simple horror film, a good one and a historic but just a horror film none the less. For that credits must go to Bruce Campbell who lift about half of the movie all by himself, the dude worked hard to provide us with something good and he didn't disappoint. All in all it is one of the best horror movies I have seen and I highly recommended to anyone, this one of these films you have to see before you die. For real I am dead serious about it ;).",8,0,0,12 November 2016
V for Vendetta," Vengeance and Revolution.
","It has been eleven years since V came out and despite its modest box office run, the cult following ,which has created is impressive to say the least. As is commonly known is based on the graphic novel of Alan Moore, one of famous comic artist and writers ever and as he does with every adaptation of its work disown it. For real I can not see why, for the changes to the characters ,story and some events every adaptation of a literature work has those ,but we don't see the guys who wrote X- men: Days of Future Past wine abouts it.Any way the film as it stand is amazing and the political commentary it makes to the Post Nine Eleven world we live in ,makes it still on the point even a decade after its release. So the story centers to a post crisis stricken United Kingdom in which a totalitarian regime has rose and propaganda ,fear and lack of freedom in general is the norm and we follow our ,in sense, the main point of view character Eve, who meets on fifth of November V, a vigilante dead set to raise the government to the ground with any mean if need it. So as the story progress we witness Eve coming in to her out and a revolution movement happening.The theme of the film is sum up by the man in the Guy Fox mask himself: 'The shouldn't be afraid of the government ,but the government of the people'.It sounds a bit easy to understand ,but the meaning applies and to the real world as well. The governments shouldn't keep secrets from the citizen who vote for them nor spy on the in the name of security and we all know these were true then and true now. So ,fine it changed in order to fit better the time of its making, just like the original was made to criticize the Thacher type of government in the eighties, where is the problem ,both adaptation hit the authority where was deed it at the time.In the end ,Alan Moore maybe has created many amazing comic book run and graphic novels ,but in these case was an asshole and the flick rocks. A must see in deed!!",9,0,2,25 June 2016
