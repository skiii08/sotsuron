The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Almost Perfect
","The Hunger Games: Mocking Jay, was very close to a perfect movie. Jennifer Lawrence delivers an emotionally intense, but believable Katniss Everdeen. The Characters portrayed were intelligent and believable. At no point did they make choices that would seem illogical or out of place, simply to drive the plot forward... (with one small exception) like in so many movies these days.The movie was genuinely inspiring, and generally unpredictable. Leaving the audience squirming in their seats as they try to anticipate the coming scenes. Certainly I am glad to have never read the books, because knowing how things would have played out would have ruined so much of the suspense and intensity. At no point was I bored, choosing to hold my bladder for the final half our, so as not to miss a moment.EXTREME SPOILERS AHEAD, only for those that have already seen the movie: My only small gripe, the only thing that makes this movie not completely perfect, (and this is certainly a subjective opinion) is President snow's choice to allow the rescue-team to recover the tributes from the capitol. Sure, one of them had a small chance to kill Katnis, sure she would feel emotional trauma at the pain inflicted on Peta, but I imagine it would have been a lot more effective to execute them, than to give them such a moral boosting victory and allowing them to save more important figure-heads of the rebellion. This decision did not seem as smart, nor as sociopathic as I imagine President Snow to be. I can live with writing this off as President snow being rather demented and therefor somewhat unpredictable, but not without a little reservation.",9,10,34,29 November 2014
This Is the End," This is a bad movie
","Full of celebrity wanking. 'Wow guys, look at all my cool celebrity friends! Can you feel our awesome sense of humor and creativeness? Aren't we funny and witty!?' The juvenile and toilet humor lacks any real wit. You end up feeling the cast all deserve to die and wish that they would, long before the end. Best thing about it was some surprisingly cool special effects. I really thought this move was gonna be cool, but it was just lazy and felt like an inside-joke that I wasn't a part of. Some of the performances and adolescent humor made me embarrassed just to be watching. Too bad, Seth Rogan is such an endearing hottie with a friendly voice, it's sucks to hate on him, but in this movie, I have no choice.",3,3,8,25 November 2013
Interstellar," Inner Ear Cancer
","So... many are going to disagree with me: but... Interstellar sucked. 50% of this was due to the soundtrack. It's not that I'm super picky about what amazing tunes should play during my movies. It's just that I don't think they should make me vomit my brain out of my skull. The droning, overbearing-soundtrack featured everyone's favorite instrument: The Dial-tone-xylophone-pipe-organ-flute. This usually hung on one note in a very high pitched whine, or, if you were lucky, it would be featured in a cord that replayed over and over again. Not just replaying though, but getting louder and louder over time, so loud that one might seriously consider burying their face in molten lava, if only to escape the assault on one's ears. So loud that the words the characters are saying can not even remotely be discerned, even in a very high-class theater, with state-of-the-art audio. However, remember, this Soundtrack-for-Masochists was only half the reason the movie was lame.The other half was bad science, overplayed space-movie-tropes and extremely questionable character decisions.First we have the blight, it's killing every plant on earth with dirt. Yes ladies and gentlemen, the final blow to humanity will come in the form of a clingy dust that just won't wash away. Why, or how this came to be is never explained, but it's killing all the plants and getting stuck in our lungs, and for some reason it's going to end humanity because everyone seems to have forgotten how to grow indoor hydroponic food like with already do with a number of crops. Also, the blight is somehow, kinda-maybe a biological plague that feeds off nitrogen... or is it dirt? I don't freakin' know at this point, and the movie doesn't really help you understand if one is causing the other, or if their the same thing, or what.Add to that, some excruciatingly poor, or at best implausibly unvetted decision making, toss in some random space-madness, and after about the halfway point, the movie became a chore to watch. As Interstellar gets closer to the end, it starts to seem like a contest in a game of 'wouldn't it be cool if' before it blessingly concludes with, everything is fine now because of black holes and gravity, yaay.Save yourself some money by putting on some headphones and plugging them into a light socket while watching the most contrived and nonsense episodes of Star Trek. If you can't hear half of the dialog because of the painful whirring in your ears, you have succeeded in simulating Interstellar.",3,5,9,28 November 2014
The Wrestler," for wrestling fans or desperate homos
","A lot of people told me this movie was awesome. Well, they're gay... no literally. I can see why they would like it. Lots of very beefy half naked guys running around groping each other, for the rest of you... well this movie is about a washed up pro-wrestler. Really, he's washed up, he's not smart, or funny or anything interesting, he's just some desperate washed up old man and I found it hard to relate to someone so stupid. He's hard to feel sorry for because, well, the things he does are just so stupid you feel he deserves what he gets.The lack of empathy for the main character does not negate how depressing the movie is. Also, don't watch this movie if you still think pro wrestling is real.(hahahahahah) This movie is also done in the style of 'amature camera' as seen an many documentaries, this would normally work, but the main character is so depth-less that this just seems like a cheap ploy for attention.Finally, this movie has a strange hypnotic effect on people who are interested or were interested in pro-wrestling. My boyfriend liked it, and he hates everything. So like I said if you are a pro-wrestling fan you will probably somehow like this movie... otherwise stay away, stay far away.",2,3,17,10 May 2009
