The Blair Witch Project," Great Concept!
","I understand this flick is not for everyone, but I think it is one of the best *films* -- not just suspense/horror films -- I've seen in a long time, and an antidote for those of us long jaded by Hollywood formula films. You might not like it, especially if you were expecting the formula, but if you are looking for something fresh and creative AND very very scary, I can recommend this one highly.  The concept -- the actors actually filmed most of the footage since they are supposed to be making a documentary -- is brilliant.  I think some might under-estimate this film because it looks amateurish -- but that's why it works so well!  Afraid of the dark?  Half the film is black, threatening, night footage.  The sounds are left to terrify the viewer -- and it worked: I kept hitting the mute button when I couldn't take it anymore and thus found myself watching a black silent screen!!!  This is great stuff.",10,1,2,2 July 2000
