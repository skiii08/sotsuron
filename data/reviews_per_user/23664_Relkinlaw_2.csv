The Equalizer," It is the depth of the Characters as brilliantly woven together by A. Fuqua that Earns a 10 from me.
","This movie is about the war of good and evil, the transformation of the hero, Denzel, from killer to protector, and his ardent wish to be in the service of good--a redemption from his Black ops background. I believe it is the subterranean nature of this conflict that makes him an anti-hero. His past was something he describes only to Teddy: 'I've done a lot of bad things in his life; things for which I am not proud.' The use of violence by DW in his past is unquestionably evil and a disease from which he suffers (he is unable to sleep and dream), and from which he must find redemption; clear ref to Bush era of targeted assassinations, imprisonment and rendition of huge numbers of violent men taken to black sites--for money and never based on any evidence. Thus, he planned his death to avoid destroying his soul because he knew the things he was told to do were fundamentally evil. There was never any real basis for their death or imprisonment, nor was the Bush admin. ever able to do anything but lie about the use of violence. Thus, with violence co-opted by the 'Government' for whom he worked, he is a man who has lost any faith that his 'work' had, or could have, a moral basis. We meet DW in this shadowy world of dreams he reads the Old man and the Sea by Hemingway and Don Quixote, by Cervantes. And the reason he is doing this is spiritual. He keeps a connection with his wife, recently having passed, through this 'dream-world' of fiction she had begun: moreover, The Old Man has no name, yet he fights 'forces of nature' to be himself; Don Quixote fights for freedom in a time when his abilities are out of sync with the nature of the times. So, too, DW, learns that he is both men, thus, when he returns, he plans and executes his own death, and is symbolically reborn by destroying true evil.",10,0,1,10 August 2016
John Wick," John Wick must lose himself in order to find himself
","KR is brilliant in this ambiguous, deep and strangely moving film. Like DW in the Equalizer, KR has risen above the amoral, dirty 'business' of assassins whose job it is to keep Hell filled with souls. He had his most profound hopes fulfilled by Brigitte Moynahan, who, significantly, is not in the film. She appears only in KR's memories so that he can perhaps maintain a connection with the pure life of joy he had in this world. Moynahan is symbolic of Dante's Beatrice, his ideal woman, residing in Heaven who guides Dante to paradise. But, before Wick is able to mourn the loss of his Beatrice, sick, sycophantic, arrogant yet pathetically weak urchins invade his home and kill his sweet beagle, sent by his dying wife, called daisy, which his Beatrice has sent so as to allow him to go on and believe in the beauty of this world. When this last vestige of purity is torn from him, however, he descends to the twisted, almost phantasmagorical life of darkness and death in which assassins (and their minions) reside. In order to return, he must dig up his tools and his coins, symbolic of his past life as an assassin having been sent down to hell. He had been reborn, only to die when he buries Moynahan. The dramatis personae he meets during his descent to the world of death are likened to the souls who come to the shore of the Styx river to be ferried by Charon and was then miraculously returned to life. The burial of daisy faintly suggests the Greek God of fertility, the opposite of Charon. The portrayal of the assassins is shot in the light of suspended disbelief, symbols of those who take life, descend to hell, and buy their way back to the real world. The imagery is brilliant and never misses a beat. All of the assassins strangely want him to return as if he is Lucifer himself, and they express joy (and legitimate fear) that he is 'back'--e.g.,the 'cleaner,' the Concierge at the Continental, whose name is Charon because the producer knew that the audience needed the symbolism 'dumbed down'. KR was apparently the best of all, each of them must admit, but the question that tortures them is why he has returned--they have never tasted the purity of real life--so, has he returned because the 'real' world could not satisfy, or is it the 'reality' of the assassin's dreamworld that has drawn him back? This is the tension which is played out on the edge of a knife. The images of the film pass from real to dreamlike and back again; one has to reorient and accept that both are false. The assassins consider themselves 'Professionals' while, KR, who has perspective on this murderous world, knows their evil nature. The coins used by the assassins as their only currency and are a brilliant allusion to the Ferryman, Charon of Greek myth, who is paid to ferry the deceased across the river Styx to Paradise. The coins are used exclusively by assassins in place of 'money' because, fundamentally, these trained assassins don't need money--since money is only valuable in this world--and Charon does not take but a coin for his ferry. They need the coin, for that is their lot in life, to need to traverse the river. In a campy scene, KR finds a puppy again, in an unnecessary 'hit the audience over the head' image, signifying his return to this world after banishing death from this world.",10,2,6,10 August 2016
