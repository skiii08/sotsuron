The Blair Witch Project," Stone Soup
","The Blair Witch Project deserves an A as film class final project. The concept is good. The throwback to the pre-special effects days where the imagination was loosed to create horror/fear is fine.  As entertainment a C is much closer. The 'forest' has been great in myth and literature as a frightening place where trees blot out the sun and poor lost waifs wander. So how do we get stuck with this scrubby excuse of a forest? I've been lost in far scary forests and this one would have been a joke. Then we have the acting... There isn't much worse than reaching the end of a movie and the only remaining character is someone you hope dies quickly and painfully. Fortunately, from the beginning we knew all the characters had disappeared and were undoubtedly dead so we had little to stress over. It is just amazing how many people have seen this 'ink blot' of a movie and managed to project their own imagined story lines, fears, stellar performances etc into it. I haven't been a fan of  all white or all black paintings that profess to have some deep insights into life.  It is commendable that with not much more than that the directors were able to catch an audience willing to fill in not only the details but all of the main ingredients. Any one remember Stone Soup?",5,0,3,11 August 1999
Minority Report," Spielberg
","It is sad when critics reach the point where the name of the director automatically insures a positive review.  Genius that he is or was, the last 2 films are by any standard poor.  Here again despite the appeal of Cruise, is a movie that lacks any cohesion, sensitivity, vision, or logic.  There is no 'minority report'.  Rather there is an echo.  There is no sympathetic character, only a world devoid of any redeeming characteristics.  Craft maybe high but the story is totally lacking.  Why is Spielberg so fascinated by the loss of children?  How do you justify motivations covering 6 years? Why do the plots have to be transparent? Why does the movie drag on?  Watch it without the thought that this was done by the same man who gave us Jaws, ET, Indie etc.  Even the best directors often run dry, Kubrick for one. Here is another.",4,1,2,21 June 2002
Cast Away," Well, Hanks is good.
","There are movies that are part very good but in the whole unsatisfying. This is one.  The plane crash and struggle to the island are well shot.  Hanks is great in his struggle to survive on the island both physically and mentally. Wilson as a companion and primitive god is a good device.  Unfortunately the love story that surrounds the action in the movie's construction is too thin and doomed from the outset to eliminate any reasonably 'happy' or meaningful conclusion. Two people pretty well absorbed by their respective careers, Hanks a Fedex exec and Hunt working on a PhD, cannot quite find time or the full commitment to formalize their relation. A dramatic accident that creates the action and one person show for Hanks. Finally, rescue after 4 years and confrontation with Hunt who has moved on. Hunt however does deliver both a 'you are the love of my life' speech and a 'I had a really hard time after you were lost' line.  Please.  How could Hanks have a meaningful relationship with Hunt if she honestly believed that her hard times had any comparative aspect to being lost on an island for 4 years of near Hellish suffering? Who can believe that Hanks would want or expect Hunt to leave a husband(why cast 'Big' from Sex in the City?) and child?  The three items that kept Hanks going were Wilson ( a mixture of god and inner values), the package ( a commitment) and the picture of Hunt (love interest).  In the end he's left Hunt, delivered the package and lost Wilson.  Yes he can wander any of the roads open to him as in a new life. No, it doesn't make sense or pull the movie together.",7,0,1,29 December 2000
La La Land," So So
",Anyone who finds the chemistry between Stone and Gosling wonderful will be divorced in a few years. Seriously a better male figure would have made this a classic. Stone is wonderful. The music is good. The story is pretty good. Still the story needs a more accessible male figure and that is not overcome by the rest of the story.,7,0,7,17 February 2017
Up," Up is Down
","In the past couple months I've seen Coraline, Aliens vs Monster and now UP. UP is the weakest of the 3. Balloons are beautiful and the scenery is great. And that about sums up the 3 D. The story? Yes Bambi and Lion King have the sad beginnings from which our 'hero' emerges. Carl, however, is an old man who at the end defeats a guy who has to be 90+ years old. Dogs flying airplanes? Please. The talking collars are maybe believable but come on. The hero of Carl's youth kills people who come to 'steal' his elusive quarry Kevin? Just one more 'loss' for Carl and the much missed Ellie. Why does Russell remind me of Dash, check his mouth. Why does the black father at the end look like Ice or whatever his name was in The Incredibles? What happened to Russel's father? Why is Carl there at the end and 'mom' is sitting in the audience? They needed Russel to be an orphan and they couldn't come up with a story line for it. The whole no child section is just too much at the beginning. If you are looking for a good cry about lost lives, lost loves, lost dreams and some ridiculous resolution when you throw away your cane and become an adventurer, here is your movie. Maybe they'll make a 3 D animate version of Sleepless in Seattle next?",4,13,42,29 May 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Waste
","Both my wife and I decided that the screening audiences had to have been too intimidated by George Lucas to comment on the fact that there is no dialogue or story underpinning the very pretty pictures. Maybe George just sees more in a scene than the rest of us and tries to minimize lines to avoid taking away from the pictures. Still this is at best boring, stilted, and at times comical in the inconsistencies of the actions, powers, and knowledge of the characters. Really, until the end no one is supposed to suspect that Darth is the father? Please! Everyone could have died at the end and there would be no sense of loss. I've seen them all from the beginning and after the first 3 there has been no quality in these films worth mentioning. The critics live in world of awe for the directors or executive producers and have had to swallow Kubrick's last picture and most of Spielberg's recent stuff knowing that they are addressing icons. Sorry. Nothing worse than genius that has lost its special gift. Few are great for a life time. These have left their great works far behind them. We can only be glad that the first 3 had a special quality. Enjoy the good and try to tolerate the rest.",5,3,6,10 June 2005
Vanilla Sky," Too Slow
","Ebert describes this as requiring heavy lifting. Seems to me that at some point the viewer decides if the reward is worth the lifting and personally by the 90 minute mark I had decided that no 'explanation' in the conclusion was going to balance out the tedium of the action. Did Cruise deserve to be wealthy? Probably no. Was he responsible? Not much. Did he 'use' Diaz? Yes. Was she using him? Seems like it.  Did his getting into the car with Diaz after his night with Cruz justify the results? By what yardstick? Do we care about Cruise or Diaz as people? Cruz was 'cute' but Cruise was unconvincing. Weak science fiction at the conclusion. And if the first voice saying 'open your eyes' is Cruz's voice, then there is no moment of objective reality in the entire movie-it is all dream.",4,0,0,2 November 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The Series is a 10
","I'm grappling with the overall view of this final piece of the series. The initial 90 minutes were in general not up to what I expected.  All the involvement of the prior movies was missing.  I can recognize Jackson's desire to set up the final character developments but as a stand-a-lone piece, I believe he would lose an audience that wasn't already committed to the series.  So how do you rate the movie by itself?  I love the multiple conclusions because they address the issue of how someone who experiences something so outside the realm of anyone else can continue to 'live' in the world of everyone else.  Pippin and Merry didn't in the book. The moral turmoil resolutions for the main characters where they decide who they are and what they want to achieve are great. I agree with everyone who says Sam was the best character and should be up for an Oscar (not that Hollywood matters).  I was less impressed with Gollum after the not so good piece in the beginning where he kills the character who actually finds the ring. Did Jackson think that furthered the development from the hints from prior movies?Battle scenes:  amazing.  Scenery:  wonderful.  CGI:  good but problems with size again: look at the elephants and Legolas.Superb performances by the Rohans and Gondors.  Still find Liv Tyler weak.I really wanted to love this movie and despite some expected tears during the various conclusions, felt I hadn't got what could have been based on both the prior movies and the books.  So still the best epic that has ever been done but I suspect that someone someday will surpass this.  Until then, here is the mark, beat it.",9,1,2,17 December 2003
Gladiator," Overrated and derivative
","To give Gladiator its due, the music is good and aspects of the filming are also much above average.  Unfortunately, there is little to either the story line or the acting to understand the ridiculous comments regarding the quality of this movie.  The antagonist is reminiscent of Caligula with over-acting and a twisted personality that defies understanding where his political strength came from.  The protagonist is wooden and compares poorly to all the prior 'heroes' of this genre. Russell Crowe manages to make Victor Mature look good which is quite an accomplishment.When you start a movie by having the aging caesar far removed from the political center of Rome decide that he will confront his perverted son and announce that the son is getting the shaft and the general is getting the glory, credibility drops like a stone.  No one but Maximus, the son and the daughter know of the plans for succession. Oh, surprise! son kills father. Son kills Maximus' family. Maximus spends the movies going through slavery, remote gladiator contests, Rome and final confrontation. If there was one clever plot element along the way, I missed it.  Gladiator=glad it was over.",6,0,0,28 May 2001
