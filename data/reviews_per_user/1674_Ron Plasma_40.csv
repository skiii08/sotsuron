The Blair Witch Project," Simply Brilliant

Ron",Null,0,0,22 November 1999
Frost_Nixon," That Was The Sixties That Was
","I'm sort of pleased that such an esoteric confrontation as Frost/Nixon achieved a theatrical stage and I suppose an extension of that is that I'm pleased that such a narrow tail be brought to the wider cinema audience. (Those of us in the sticks have little opportunity for 'theatreland'.) My pleasure I suppose must spring from the times, the morals. David Frost to me was the clever one (!) amongst the Cambridge Alumni who brought buffoonery and satire to 60s TV. Apparently his star waned in the early 70s, a fact lost of those of us who spent those years isolated at 'University' when this meant something so very different.And Nixon. To be fair, his VP days escaped me as well, (too young), but he was the fag-end of the 60s as much as 'Gimme Shelter', (or Altamont for the statistically few who were there.) Again. I learnt about Watergate through Computer Science academic journals. Don't ask me why.Bring them together.A good early start, even though Tony Blair seemed to have been drafted in to play Frost. Some light introductions to Nixon as avarice and Frost as archetypical TV presenter. But soon Martin Sheen as Frost seems all Froth. Frank Langella as Nixon, however grows darker and darker. Deeper and deeper.Then somehow Frost triumphs. I'm sorry. I missed the ascendance. The all important on camera turnaround was lame. And I'm afraid that affects my overall view.Ron (Viewed 25Jan09)",6,1,7,3 February 2009
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 1:0 down - ninety minutes to go!
","I saw it.  It was OK.  The effects, well the panoramics, (I'm tired of the zap-'em-ups), were excellent.  The story was minimal.  The - what was that they were supposed to be doing? Oh, yes - acting was wooden.  You've read all about it.  Don't bother reading this.Ron",Null,1,2,12 September 1999

Very little in that the number of events is small. This of course is at odds with the magnitude of these events.And we know the ending, even though I found myself engrossed by the 'tension' of the final cockpit skirmish.. In this respect it had a lot in common with Touching The Void. The Big difference being TTV was a fascinating insight into the minds and motives of extraordinary men.

Erin Brockovich," A serviceable smile
","The China Syndrome.  Silkwood.  The Insider.  Ring any bells?  Well now it's time for Erin Brokovich.  (OK.  I'll take back The Insider.)  Enjoyable stuff, but far from gripping I'm afraid.  Was it meant to be?  Or was this just another vehicle in which Julia Roberts can stretch those legs and smile that smile?  Never mind.  We'll let this one through with just the quibble on how hard I find it to accept Salford's finest, (Albert Finney), basking in California sunshine.  Sunday mornings were never like this.Ron",5,1,4,17 September 2000
I'm Not There," This Review Kills Fascists
","I'm 57. I write that because if both the Internet and I last, I might re-read this in years to come and revel in what it was like to be so young.However, if the former survives and the latter doesn't, I imagine at some stage I will experience the 'life flashing before you' episode. My expectation is that this will be a 'Man Who Fell To Earth' set-up, (even now, there's a lot to get through at one sitting), with a video wall of simultaneous TV broadcasts.I'd be more than happy if one screen played 'I'm Not There'. (I'm hoping that by the time it's required, another will be playing the yet to be green-lit 'The Bobby Charlton Story'.)I don't claim to be a Bob Dylan fan, but I never cease to be amazed at how his soundtrack has resonated through my life, (so far). Perhaps this film was too easy  but equally susceptible to idolatry. It worked.Other people interpreting Dylan also populate my memory stacks. Todd Haynes' free skipping between Dylan originals and on screen covers felt perfectly natural, and absolutely seamless.But was it a good film? Dunno, but very enjoyable. And Cate Blanchett??? Amazing. But very, very unsettling! Great stuff.Ron Plasma (Viewed 17Jan08)",7,3,5,18 January 2008
Coraline," Sweet
","Sometimes it's just curiosity.A quick diversion. I'm currently in Belfast, and loving it. I've had a strange fascination with this city's history over the last forty years and it's somewhat strange to be amongst names I remember so vividly from my past. As evocative as 'I counted them out..' to me is 'after another night of violence in '.One reason I'm enjoying myself so much is I'm staying smack bang in the centre of the city, walking distance of the recently rebranded QFT as well as two multiplexes. And this city centre is so familiar, yet so not English. (I probably mean not American.) Customary eating chains are not to be seen, or are at least few and far between.But now we have Victoria Square. A cathedral of glass and shopping topped by an Odeon in all its smelly popcorn stickiness, and surrounded by all the usual food simulating suspects. (I won't name them.)I'm nearly there. Hang on.Admission price fairly hefty, but I do get a fancy pair of spectacles. For this is Coraline 3-D. Only  not wow. For in the interminable pre-show there are trailers for any number of coming-soons – all in 3-D. I'm 58 now. I've seen it all before, but there's no denying, 3-D is here to stay.The film? It was OK. Not really for me.Ron (Viewed 26May09)",6,0,4,26 June 2009
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," Penny Lame

Shakespeare in Love," Pray, good people, be civil.
","At an early juncture of Shakespeare In Love from a Juliet laden balcony came the words 'O Romeo, Romeo!'.  This was greeted from the row behind me at the Trafford Centre with 'Wherefore art thou Romeo?', and a fit of giggles.  So. An enthusiastic, well read, but uncouth audience.It didn't matter.  There was plenty for discerning ear and eye in this glorious re-colouring of Elizabethan England.  From the 'Carry On Willie' lines of Thames' boatmen, to the harsh mind of a young John Webster.  The huge and impressive cast sparkled and were clearly enjoying themselves.  For my part I laughed, I cried, I was tempted by an orange.  Well worth my penny.",8,0,0,11 February 1999
Billy Elliot," Billy Whiz
","Nineteen eighty four/eighty five was an emotional time for me.  Thankfully I wasn't losing my job down a mine, or my very life on a football terrace. But sons were coming thick and fast, and my idealistic vision for their future was fast being shattered by grim reality.  And so the dual dramas of parent/child and system/individual in Billy Elliot quickly found vulnerable flesh in me.  Only after a settling gulp did I start to see the wider picture.  This is OK stuff - but just a little shmultsy.  The artistic kid from the wrong side of the tracks?  Surely Monty Python in the seventies, or Beyond the Fringe in the sixties, parodied this into ridicule?  Nevertheless the Bell boy was a great (dancing) star and his disgruntled frowns were adequate acting.  I'm afraid I can't say the same about his support, especially Julie Walters, for whom this seemed an exercise in stock character acting, without any real relevance to the rest of the plot.
Ron (Viewed 2Oct00)PS Needless to say the boys would now never dream of a job which required any physical labour and, although football has captured their imagination, a Â£40 a match season ticket and a prawn sandwich is their greatest aspiration. Sigh!",6,0,2,28 February 2001
Pirate Radio," Carry On Climbing Up The Ladder
","My God this was an awful film.And I was looking for every once of delight as without thinking too deeply, this seemed a rich area for a feel good film. (Yes I have. See my review in January.) I had heard some excruciating reviews, but to be fair, there have been any number of Richard Curtis films post 4W&AF which struck me as mawkish at the time, but now feel quite pleasant in a nothing else on the telly sort of way.Thus the precise perfection of sub-three minute ground-breaking distorted guitar that was The Kinks, against an exploding background of unself-consciously happy, dancing people boded ever so well. You Really Had Me from 'Girl'.But then what? A succession of mind-numbing excuses for plots/laughs that drift away without the slightest effort of context, culminating in PSH and Rhys Ifans seeing how far they can climb up a ladder. Laugh? No.A slow word rate and general lassitude meant I had the Carry On references in my mind before the sad news about Peter Rogers. My condolences.Ron (Viewed 7Apr09)",3,5,11,2 May 2009
Bridget Jones's Diary," Pants. Big Pants!
","I hadn't realised that Crouching Tiger had set the tone for 2001 as a girlie year.  Things really got into the swing with Bridget Jones, and I started to recognise some of the Chemist's goods which filled the pre-trailer advertisement slots.  Still.  No complaints.  Don't suppose I dare!  And high marks for Rennee, an unobtrusive Texan in the realm of a Grant fop.Ron (Viewed 15Apr2001)",6,0,1,29 May 2002
Notting Hill," Maybe some weddings. Possibly a funeral or two.
","It's carnival time for Notting Hill in that London, which has reminded me that there are a number a films for which I have still to log my comments with the IMDB.  Sorry fans.  I really have been ill.So, Notting Hill.  Yes I enjoyed it.  Even from the very first scene where they are in bed and jump out yelling, 'F***, f***, f***erty f***'.  No, wait a minute.  That was Four Weddings.  Anyway the bit where they read out one of Auden's Twelve Songs at the.  No.  That must have been 4W&F.  Still Hugh Grant was great as. as. as he usually is.  And I really enjoyed it.

Burn After Reading," Screen Diving
","My joke about the toilets at the Carling Festival isn't going to translate onto the global IMDb scene, so please take it as read  it was pretty damn good!But the film? Loved it. Why? Pure entertainment. A galaxy of stars each putting in a splendid cameo. John Malkovich was, I guess, Being John Malkovich, (did I really just write that?), but Frances McDormand was superb in her quest for fleshy perfection. And then the god like perfection that is George Clooney came in with another Oh Brother idiot. What a joy. Top marks though to Brad Pitt. A magnificent acting performance sees him as an ineffectual, girlfriend-less nerd. How good can you get?Ron(Viewed 21Oct08",7,1,5,3 December 2008
Cast Away," While the Cast are away
","This is clearly a subject which easily captures the human imagination but I will give Zemeckis his due credit, in that I although I groaned at the prospect of two and a half hours of learning to catch fish, light a fire etc, etc, my need to get up and move on remained on hold.  So.  Good points? An impressive air crash with an underwater ballet reminiscent of Tom Hanks trying to reach a Normandy beach.  A wonderful sense of the power and beauty of tides, both in their height, as Hanks battles against them, and their omnipresence as beautifully portrayed from the island mountain top panorama. But most of all for me was the middle of the night eyeball with an enormous whale.  Did we dream that?

American Beauty," What? A beauty?
","OK everyone.  Take some time out and look up Hyperbole in a dictionary.  (To save you further time - I can tell you that patronising means treating in a condescending way.)  Stop giving films votes of ten until the next Mean Streets, Godfather, or Pulp Fiction comes along.  I mean!!  This dammed thing is number 2 at the moment in the IMDB all time greats.  Get real!!But...  Kevin Spacey is brilliant.  Mena Suvari and Thora Birch are excellent in their own very different ways.  The bedding of Mena by Kevin is one of those GREAT film moments for me.Yeah.  This is an excellent film.  It deserves seven or eight from me.Ron",7,0,0,16 February 2000
The White Ribbon," Best In Show
","The White Ribbon was dark, mysterious, labyrinthine, a real puzzle. Doesn't sound a barrel of laughs does it?Nor was it. But it was a wonderful film. How can this be? My only suggestion is the remarkable balance brought to the screen. An excellent cast deliver a complex story challenging even my enormous brain to fathom out out exactly what's going on. But time and time again I 'lost the plot' because I was transfixed by a fabulous shot of – a wall. Or – a field. Or – a road. Seriously. And no mind altering drugs involved.All my pretensions tell me this was the best film of 2009. I find it hard to argue.Ron(Viewed 17Nov09)",7,4,12,24 January 2010
Being John Malkovich," Oops inside your head
","Being John Malkovich started poorly through my own eyes.  The chaos and artificial lighting of the marital home threatened a headache for me, and once the floor seven and a half joke had had its moment its claustrophobic feel began to irritate me.  Then, around the time Catherine Keener appeared, the way out became easier.  From here on I was gripped.  I single Ms Keener out because a) she is devastatingly beautiful, but also b) it was impossible to relate to the John Cusack, Cameron Diaz or John Malkovich characters.  I should add that this is the result of a fascinating storyline rather than poor acting.  OK.  I'll admit it.  It was very very late on that I remembered that Cameron Diaz was in this film.  I may have used this line before, but, Cameron Diaz?  Unattractive?  What an actor!  Top marks this year.It's the morning after by now.  I feel I need to go back again.Ron",8,0,1,6 June 2000
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Supernanny
","The Men Who Stare At Goats was a bright, sparkly affair, stuffed absolutely full of nonsense, but nonsense brought to life by an earnest delivery from George Clooney. How I admire the way this man goes about the idiot beauty roles.Can't say quite the same for Ewan McGregor, who always strikes me not so much as versatile, rather searching for a new Renton.Not to worry. In the end I found the real star of this fluff to be the wonderful Jeff Bridges. A triumph in military regalia and pony-tail.Sign me up!Ron(Viewed 1Dec09)",7,1,1,2 February 2010
No Country for Old Men," Nice one Bros
","Wonderful. Wonderful, and surely a great film. Support me here. Some films I think it's just me, but this was classic.But why? Short scenes? Not the annoying pop-video rapid cut. Not the pretentious lingering shots. But each one a gem.Daylight, by and large. None of those ridiculous scenes where someone is alone in the office/warehouse/spaceship and decides to conserve energy by working with only a desk light. Come on! Familiarity? The Barton Fink corridors. The Fargo fence. Oh, Brother  the landscape. (Was that a reverse angle Ethan Hawke?) Familiarity? It took me a while to warm to Terminator  but that was Sci-Fi. Much of the same mindless violence here, but exactly that. A psychopath, rather than a macho hero. Yet still able to patch himself up with a needle and thread! And team that with Pulp Fiction  yes, it's up there. I can't recall another film where the thrills are so perfectly timed and executed that I spent the whole couple of hours with an idiotic grin an my face. 'That was funny wasn't it? I don't want to think too much about the gore'.Did I mention Pulp Fiction? OK. Not quite. No surreal story thread. But pretty damn close.Ron Plasma (Viewed 23Jan08)",8,0,2,24 January 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," 'I Shot A Man In Tesco  Just To Watch Him Die'
","Two hours forty is a test of any man's cheek comfort and bladder, but luckily The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford held my attention. (It seems so long ago, but my last review had to be re-written because IMDb found it too short! No problem here. The title alone would earn 10/- on any decent newspaper.)Let's not go overboard though. This wasn't Billy The Kid, and Robert Ford was no Pat Garrett, but it was nice to see Nick Cave don moustache again in the Bob Dylan/minstrel role.I found the plot laboured, and family ties about as hard to follow as those in Broadbottom, but pleasantly shot and a performance from Brad Pitt that took me a while to appreciate. I certainly did in the end. This is a wonderful, menacing piece from Brad.Plot spoiler  he dies in the end.Ron Plasma Broadbottom, UK(Viewed 4Dec07)",7,0,2,5 December 2007
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Ron the Anglophile
","As with last year, 2001 has got off to a cracking start.  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon came with five star credentials.  Now experience is that such enthusiasm for a film - that isn't from the USA, (where hype comes as standard), or from the UK, (where local reviewers are just pleased to see anything!) - is justification for an early view before the art houses file their prints away in the 'no-one came' drawer.Well!  Yes and no.It's martial arts for heaven's sake!  Frequently performed by high kicking women!  Sarah Michelle Geller/Cameron Diaz playing it half laughs/half lust? No, no!  Michelle Yeoh & Ziyi Zhang; and let's not forget - Ang Lee.  I'll admit it.  Fifteen minutes into the film I nearly stood up and applauded the first roof top fight sequence.  It was that good!  But then the second and third were merely only OK.  It was the fifth, or was it the sixth? - dancing through the trees - that reminded me that special effects can actually be special.  Some nice location stuff too.Ron (Viewed 6Jan2001)(Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon?  It's got to be rude!)",7,0,0,9 February 2001
Gran Torino," Il buono, il buono, il buono
","You have to admire him. This was Clint Eastwood playing yet another Clint Eastwood and deservedly raking in the Dollars – so familiar, so new. I loved it! Perhaps it's the self awareness again, self awareness of the cowboy hero, then the cowboy anti-hero, then the cop anti-hero. And, brilliantly we now have the old man anti-hero. No-one could do it better.And of course long after the film ends you realise that after all the wry smiles, Mr Eastwood has put Clint in a coffin. If this was Clint's exit from the bright side of the camera it will be a pity, but what an exit!Ron (Viewed 20Feb09)",8,2,9,2 May 2009
Moulin Rouge!," Grist

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Time flies by when you're the driver of a train
","The curious thing about Benjamin Button is that he is born an old man and dies a baby. Born old. Dies young. Geddit?This sets the scene for Brad Pitt to deliver such lines as 'I'm seven, but I look a lot older', and 'will you still love me when I get acne?'. And am reading too much of a Mrs Robinson into it when a latterly older Cate Blanchett dismisses Brad Pitt with an off-hand 'Good-night Benjamin'? Need more? I thought not.I found this a wearisome film which perversely aged me disproportionately throughout its 166 minutes. Just how many times can the Daisy or Benjamin characters 'return'? I lost count. And interest. This was a short story for heavens sake. Did we really need the trail through U-boats, Presidents, and hurricanes?This isn't going to be a popular review I'm sure. I apologise in advance. But it's Awards season, and I'm reeling from a barrage of big guns. Oh for a summer of quietly considered films.Ron(Viewed 8Feb09)",6,3,5,18 February 2009

","I'm picking up the pieces of the last Millennium - but with a new resolve which permits patchy video reviews.So, Pi (seen on video).  Promised an awful lot to a Computer Nerd like myself who has evolved from a sixties Maths Nerd.  And when 3.1472 in the opening credits suddenly became several screens worth of digits - and counting - I gave a wry smile.  But then some dark (i.e. ungraspable) mystic tale began to unfold and I'm afraid I got bored.  Stick to the facts.  Give me Big Bird any day.Ron",2,5,8,27 January 2000
The Insider," Deuce
","I don't recall an awful lot about Heat other than the Pacino/de Niro elevenses.  No.  Wait a minute.  I don't really remember that, but it crops up in movie conversation all the time doesn't it?  I do remember the wide angles.  This is good exercise for us on the front seats.  But a plot?  A shoot out where the same number of bullets that halved the cast of Saving Private Ryan on reel one failed to take out de Cino (or was it Paniro).  Was there anything else?  Sorry.  Back to the Insider.  More of the same, but thankfully without the noise.  I suppose The Insider is actually the better film, but after over five hours I need a break.  Come on.

Toy Story 2," ...and beyond.
","You have to admire it don't you?  Toy Story 2 has all the delights of TS, but with added technology.

Life Is Beautiful," Laugh? I nearly died!
","I would normally run a mile in the opposite direction when faced with the prospect of concentration camp drama - but a concentration camp comedy?  I'm sure many will take the same line.  But opening reviews rank this as a must-see.  So.  Must see.  The first point to note is that it takes the best part of an hour before we realise that Roberto Benigni is playing a Jew, which is a reasonable point and makes for happy viewing.  This isn't a north European ghetto.  This is a beautiful Tuscan mountainside village and Charlie Chaplin is centre stage.  But then the storm troopers arrive.  And the chronology is irritatingly wrong.  And the camp is surreal, but in an inappropriately comic fashion.  I felt for Giorgio Cantarini and thought about the lies my father told.",7,1,2,8 March 1999
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Ordure
","A commitment is a commitment.  I've now got two 'new releases' to review. Both are way off mainstream.Firstly Salo, finally passed for public viewing in the UK.  Was I shocked? No, not really.  I don't recall my heart racing at any point.  Was I rallied into action?  No.  My stance on Nazis remains the same, although perhaps it is time to discuss 'lest we forget'.  I have just realised that some of my friends have fathers who were too young to have fought in the war.  Did I wonder why I paid good money to stare into my lap as film of young people eating s*** projected above my head?  Well - yes!I tried hard to find artistic merit in Salo.  I don't buy the excuse of a defeated populace.  I smell cinematic laziness.  Fabulous period décor? I thought so.  Anyone else?But no more of this please.Ron (Viewed 3Jan2001)",2,3,12,3 April 2001
Eyes Wide Shut," It came. We saw. But did it conquer?
","There is no doubt in my mind that Eyes Wide Shut is a master work.  It's a feel isn't it?  Somehow you can sense that Nicole Kidman, a very beautiful woman, has been coached into the role of - a very beautiful woman.  But it's not the same beautiful woman.  What a clever trick!  The New York streets, (put together in Pinewood), are so New York that you expect Gene Kelly to splash about in their puddles.  Then there is the set that is a large number of the most perfect naked female bodies.  Phew!  That must have been CGI. It would upset the natural balance of the world if all that flawless flesh gathered in one room.  Omitting to do the faces was just a tease.  Oh, yeah.And Tom Cruise was OK.  So.  Masterpiece?  Maybe.  It works for me.",8,1,1,25 October 1999
The Reader," Hard Lines
","A hard beauty. A joy to behold. Unadorned, utilitarian, purposeful. Cold as steel, and maintaining a firm line constantly. What man could resist? Yes those 1950s trams were things of great wonder.Kate Winslett was OK too, but my problem is that I always find Kate's characters slightly annoying. Unfortunately, I feel the same about Ralph Fiennes. And believe it or not, Bruno Ganz as a Robin Williamsesque university lecture , and Lena Olin as the Manhattan based gallery something-or-other, (who ARE these people?), surpassed them both. Ganz in particular. Shudder.The film itself I felt started slowly with no real meat to the cold romance depicted.

","What a pleasant way to start the year.  A fun cartoon, but one with just that edge of intellect.  And more!  It provoked the 'is it as good as the book' discussion amongst my boys which even dragged in the most street conscious of them.  It was a joy to watch.  Bearing all this in mind, does my opinion actually count?  Probably not.  I'll just add that I couldn't decide whether it was Laurie Anderson or Mr Blobby providing the Giant's voice.  Oh Superman!

Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Smokin'!
","You can't ignore him, this Woody Allen bloke. Gone is the succession of one liners. Long gone. Gone is Allen himself in his annual outing. Gone is an addiction to New York. So what do we have left?Well, we have a European tour which now reaches Catalonia, and quite pleasant it is too. Pleasant. I think I found Match Point 'pleasant', but I may have been in the minority there. I think we may have to get used to this. The older ones, you know,  Distant memories, but enough to grant Woody leeway. I think we now have very much a Ronnie Corbett arm-chair joke  cosy, familiar, and professionally executed. But forgettable.So just in case that turns out to be the memory let's mention some interesting contribution from Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall; a new side to Javier Bardem; and an outstanding performance from Penelope Cruz who I suspect has set the anti-smoking lobby back thirty years and in fact may even have caused Operation Trident a headache or two.

By the time I got to see the 'staggering' flo-mo effects, they were already commonplace in TV beer adverts.  Now I come to think about it, so were anthropomorphic creepy-crawlies.  That's the problem with special effects.  They soon become old hat.  With me the watershed came about fifty minutes into the film.  I began to get bored, and there was a long way to go!What's next.

I'm happy with long though.The Thin Red Line is a remarkable film and will stay with me.  The gently blowing strands of long grass on a seemingly insignificant hillside rank alongside bleeding heads on 'Apocalypse Now' bamboo poles as harbingers of doom.  And the repeated sudden switch to the strikingly beautiful fauna of otherwise pacific islands was a trip all by itself.  Surreal.  Not quite real.Now then.

Slumdog Millionaire," The Colour Of Money
","We have long known that the worst toilet in the world is in Scotland; Trainspotting's Edinburgh for Danny Boyle, but the Glen Affric bothy for us adventurers. So the early 'humour' of a small child jumping into a sea of (word censored by authoritarian IMDb)somehow boded well for what was billed as a feel-good movie. Even when you are, literally, in it deep, you can still crawl your way out.But I'm afraid I saw in Slumdog Millionaire too much that could not be soaped off: Torture; child abuse; mutilation. Come on? Not nice.I'll probably change my mind over time, but such horrors burnt my own retina to such an extent that the  once again literal  riot of movement and colour didn't compensate. A good film, but as far as I was concerned the 'feel-good' was limited to the 'Millionaire' scenes that Celador present us with every week.Two final points at opposite ends of my muddled mind: I've seen Freida Pinto described as the great beauty of 2009  but wasn't she Candice in Corrie a few years ago? Four days before watching 'Slumdog' I learnt the word 'crore' from Raju's resignation letter. I don't have 'dedication' rights, but I wish all Satyam innocents well in these astonishing times.One more. One more.

Well me initially, then the God-like George Clooney, who I thought was going to appear in a new tie for every scene of this film, (not quite), seemed right on message. But when Vera Farmiga endorsed the trend by wearing one as her entire ensemble, (double Windsor around the waist, the rest coquettishly draped over her backside), it was back where it belonged.Do I digress? This was a fabulous jolly, several in fact, with George Clooney charming the pants of everyone. Isn't it strange to see GC playing someone you actually want to be? Was there a moral? Who cares.

"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Oh boy!
","Then came the Coen brothers!  The trailer-hobo-trailer had whetted my appetite even before I had spotted the Ethan and Joel rubber stamp of excellence.  But then came the film itself.  O Brother is such a wonderful film.  Beautifully, beautifully shot.  Fabulous acting from George Clooney - yes that George Clooney, and John Turturro; and John Goodman.  And Michael Badaluuco.  And Tim Blake Nelson. A fabulous script.  Magnificent references to Homer; to Johnson; to Southern politics, (and this praise from someone who thinks that the South starts at Stoke).  Were I not laughing so much throughout O Brother my jaw would have dropped to the level of Delmar's at the sheer perfection of this film.Ron (Viewed 21Sep00)PS More clues to those of you trying to piece together my biography through these reviews - my ex father-in-law claimed to be related to Baby Face Nelson through Shetland origins.  Beat that!",8,0,0,28 February 2001
