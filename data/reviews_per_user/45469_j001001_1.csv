Deja Vu," Deja Vu-a fantastic sci-fi movie
","What a great movie! It combines Sci-Fi, action, and other essences of mysteries. How they change time and how will it develop isn't really understanding at the beginning, but it always leads to an special ending that you couldn't predict. Maybe the time in our world looks like that, too, like a huge river. One day, when we have develop higher technology, maybe we can prevent many disasters in that way(although it seems dangerous) The leading characters, except Denzel Washington, aren't so famous as Tom Cruise and Keenu, but this movie can make them more famous! There's still too much to explore with our ATF agent Doug Carlin!",Null,0,1,13 June 2007
