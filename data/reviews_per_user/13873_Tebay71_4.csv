Sucker Punch," I unexpectedly fell in love with this movie
","I heard nothing but bad things about this movie, and I finally saw it. I fell in love with it. Everything about it was so great and visual (as excepted with Zack Snyder). What people lose grasp of, I think, is that 90% of the film is in Babydoll's head. Therefore, anything goes. Yeah they're dressed scandalously, but what else would they be wearing in a young girl's mind? And of course they're going to be able to fight, it's all in her mind. It was a way of escaping for Babydoll. If my mother and sister were just killed, I might be a little screwed in the head too, wouldn't you? I think people saw the preview, and just assumed hot chicks and special effects. They didn't (and usually never do) think beyond what is shown to them on screen. I love Synder's work, and it's sad that this is by far his least appreciated film.",7,29,51,4 June 2011
Insidious," One of the Worst
","I want to preface this by saying I am a very big horror film fan. I've seen a lot of horror films, and I have great respect for the genre. Having said that, this is one of the worst horror films I've ever seen in my life. I paid $1.50 to see this at the theater, and I want my small change back.There are so many weak points in this film, it's hard to begin with just one. I'll begin with the weakest, the directing. Now I'm a fan of Wann's original Saw and Dead Silence was even tolerable at points. Insidious is just one big whiff. The decisions the characters made at points were so unbearable that I contemplated just leaving the theater early. The part that has stood out to me to be one of the worst parenting moves in the history of film was when the mother finds the sheets covering her son with bloody hand prints on them, and she just waits for her husband to come home to 'deal with it'? No calling the cops, no getting her family out of the house, just wait outside on the porch (with whatever did that inside with her son alone) for her husband to come home? Another point was when her husband is doing his out-of-body experience or whatever, we're supposed to just forget about that and be surprised later in the film that his son can do it too? Lastly what bothered me about the directing was when the husband is in his class room and 'Wann' and the doll from Saw are written on the chalk board. This is just flat out classlessness. Not only am I pulled-out of the story, but I'm not thinking of the film at all. I'm thinking of how pretentious the director is for having those in the background.The acting was just so atrocious that I cannot even begin to describe how the actors 'tried' to look scared. It's like they just graduated from acting school and were going over the script in their heads thinking, 'okay, I have to be angry or scared now', then cue the clich√© look.The last points I'm going to gripe about will pertain to the directing again. These are things I've heard the most when people have complaints about the film; the sudden shift of what the film is half way though. The first half is a sort-of Paranormal Activity with a bigger budget, then the second half is Dead Silence/haunted house experience. The first half was the most fitting for the film since the film is named Insidious. The second half came out of nowhere and wasn't called for by any justification. I compare it to Dead Silence, because of the way the dead people's make-up and movements were done. It's as if they just walked off the Dead Silence set and walked right onto the Insidious set. This sudden change in the pacing and tone of the film made it seem like it didn't know what it wanted to be.All in all, I cannot recommend this for anyone. This is just another sad excuse for a horror film that unfortunately got popular, which means there will be sequels to suffer through.",1,2,6,1 February 2012
The Woman in Black," Coud Have Been Great
","Going into this film, I had read many conflicting reviews. Some loved it, some thought it was generic. I can see each side of those arguments. For many hardcore horror fans, they will come out thinking 'I've seen this 100 times before, but the saddest part is that it could have been great.' The directing was the hardest part to watch with this film. I'm a fan of James Watkins' Eden Lake, so I was expecting the directing to be better in this. It seems like with every subtle genuinely terrifying thing in The Woman in Black, an unnecessary jump scare followed. I don't know if Watkins was pressured by producers or the studio to put in those dumbed-down jump scares, but they ruined the film. As Alfred Hitchcock said 'it's not the scares that terrify the audience, it's the anticipation.' As I was watching this film, I was just anticipating jump scares, which doesn't genuinely scare anyone.Daniel Radcliffe was embarrassing with his acting. Absolutely atrocious. He didn't look scared, thrilled, saddened, or even happy. Just indifferent the entire film. He didn't act at all, just gave generic surprised looks. Having said that, there's something about him that I liked still. He has the 'it' factor, just as an actor has 'it'. Regardless, he was bad in this film.This isn't a bad film, but it sure has been done before. As I said before, this could have been amazing. I did get chills throughout my body at certain parts, but they were quickly replaced by disappointment due to jump scares. If you're a horror fan, this will be run of the mill to you. If you're new to horror, you may like this. Overall, this could have been great.",4,1,3,7 February 2012
Warm Bodies," Warm Bodies Movie Review
","When I first saw the trailer for Warm Bodies I didn't know what to take out of it. Are they trying to be this year's Zombieland? Is it going to have any horror in it at all, or will it be more of a romantic comedy? Will it have an indie feel, or would it have too much CGI? Then I saw that Jonathan Levine (The Wackness, 50/50) was directing it, and I suddenly was on board for this movie.Heading into this movie, I was hoping that this could be another gem hidden in the trash-movie-month that is January. I got The Grey last January, so could I get another one this year? Eh, no.This film certainly has its moments where it's pretty entertaining, but unfortunately there are too many other missed opportunities that overshadow the bright spots. Probably the best part about this movie was that it gave an honest try at an original idea, which is obviously more than we can say about the majority of movies.Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer were the two main actors in the film. There were moments where they probably could have used an extra take or two. Overall, they did their jobs well enough. John Malkovich plays the recognizable face that doesn't really need to be in the movie, but it's more marketable if he is character of Teresa Palmer's strict father.The main issue that I had with the film was that there were so many conveniences. There were too many scenes in the film that were just glanced over quickly, but most of the audience would assume would be a large emotional plot point. There were far too many moments that felt like they were rushed to be able to finish the story faster, which is odd considering the film is just over 90 minutes.I walked out of the theater feeling underwhelmed. I can't say that I dislike the film by any means, but I can't say I'll ever watch it again. It was a fine way to spend an hour and a half. I had some laughs, and I liked certain aspects of the movie. It will definitely entertain some, and it will definitely bother some. Unfortunately, the fact is that there were too many overly convenient parts of the movie for me.5/10",5,20,51,23 January 2013
