Hereditary," The Love It or Hate It Movie
","Notice the ratings? The viewers either gave it a ONE STAR or TEN STARS
This is a love it or hate it movie. I suspect the audience who hated this movie wanted it to be the typical gory out jump out of your seat type of horror movie What sets this horror flick apart from all the others is that it's upsettingly powerful on an emotional level and the acting is superb and the perpetual drone-like background music is another plusSo go and watch it without any expectation.",10,3,6,29 June 2018
Black Panther," Loved The Visuals But The Script, Not So Much
","I have been a Marvel/DC buff since I was a kid. Spent hours poring over my uncle's comics on a daily basis since I was 7 years old and been waiting for this movie for eons. I watched the trailer and was impressed by it and couldn't wait to see it on the big screen. The verdict: It was a disappointment. I wanted to like it so much but I just couldn't 
The stars of this movie are all very attractive but the quality of the acting isn't up to par. Even an academy award winner N'yongo couldn't connect with her co-stars
The characters lacked depth and there was no chemistry between any of them. Even between the King and his mother, and the King and Nakia. The fight scene's script between Killmonger and T'Challa when the former challenged him for the throne, was taken from Troy's fight scenes between Paris and Menelaus and between Hector and Achilles. The movie is visually breathtaking but they could've done better with the script and storyline.",3,4,7,12 March 2018
Black Panther," Disappointed
",I have been a Marvel/DC buff since I was a kid and I had wanted to like the movie so much but it was a disappointment for me. The fighting scenes reminded me of Troy's and the dialogues are not well written. The special effects are excellent though,3,2,3,11 March 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A Highly Entertaining Film
","I do not watch Mr Affleck's movies because I've never liked his acting and his face but I loved the movie.I , along with millions of other Batman fans, was furious when they chose Mr Affleck for the part but he surprised me. He was actually good in that movie. He played better than Cavill.Loved the CGI, soundtrack and cinematography.Kudos to Affleck for not being too much of an ass in the filmLoved Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. Very tall, very beautiful and a real bad a**All in all the film was entertaining. A movie that made nearly a billion bucks at the box office, can't be all that bad, can it",7,1,4,24 July 2016
