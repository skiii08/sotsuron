The Blair Witch Project," As horrifying as you allow it to be.
","When I left to the theater to see the Blair Witch Project, I thought it would be so incredibly horrifying that I would have nightmares for days on end.  However, five minutes into the film, I felt completely natural and at ease.  Blair Witch is the kind of movie that you would think would gross you out, but there is surprisingly very little gruesome imagery; most of the film's chills are derived from medieval witchcraft that the film-makers come across; and most of all, it's truly what you DON'T see on the camera that will freak you out.But then again, you won't be really scared until the last ten minutes.  And how scared you'll be depends on your imagination.  The film goes on and on with other things that you find yourself waiting for something to happen. The first half-hour of the film is really just a funny home video (although it is quite enjoyable).  There's quite a bit of unnecessary language, and the camera is consistently shaking up and down for most of the film.  Of course, this makes Blair Witch's characters and presentation very believable.The Blair Witch Project has an interesting approach to the horror genre, it's like NOTHING you've seen before; the satisfying ending will leave on the edge of your seat screaming for more, which makes it a worthy film experience.  If you want to see a big-budget horror-flick with tremendous special effects - where seeing IS believing, then Blair Witch isn't it.  If you want to see a scary home video or something that's different from other films, then I highly recommend it.  This is a true horror classic.",8,1,3,23 August 1999
