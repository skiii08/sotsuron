Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," ONE WORD - OVERHYPED
","'Star Wars: Episode 1:The Phantom Menace' was grossly overhyped.  I shall discuss the major problems in four main categories.One, I hate Jar Jar!  Damn Jar Jar!  What were you thinking, Lucas, when you created Jar Jar?  This is no Chewie, my good man!  I think everyone understands the problems with him.Two, Anakin was quite annoying.  'Yippee!' should not be heard in a sci-fi film.  I don't even think 'ET' did that.  Also, the end was quite irritating; Anakin was ACCIDENTALLY destroying the Trade Federation at the same time that Jar Jar was ACCIDENTALLY destroying tons of droids...sigh...Third, what is the deal with Amidala's makeup?  Is she a Kabuki actress in her spare time?Fourth, Darth Maul was overhyped.  They made him sound really important to the story.  He's barely in it.  R2 has more screen time than him.However, Lucas saved the film for me when he added one character: Sebulba. if it weren't for Sebulba, I would absolutely hate this film.  He was so awesome!!!  Pudu!!Anyway, with Sebulba I give this movie 5 stars, but without I give it more like 3.And as for Episodes 2 and 3...I have this advice for Lucas..Try not...do or do not...there is no try...Sadly, TPM's powers were weak.",5,0,1,31 May 1999
Fight Club," A wonderfully done movie, innovative, intelligent, and plain old cool..
","First of all, I must apologize for one of my shortcomings with this article.  Due to my slackness in getting into the theater, I missed the first few minutes, but don't worry.  Everything still came together. 'Fight Club' is the newest dark film from director David Fichner ('Seven'). The main difference between the two is that this has a lot more undertones of comedy. The story itself follows the nameless main character, played by Edward Norton (American History X).  This character (let's call him Jack) is having severe problems with his life: he feels like it is caving in on him.  The entire movie is narrated by Jack, whose sense of dry wit is often amusing. He tries to make himself feel better by buying kitchen sets from catalogs, which is illustrated with an amazing shot of Jack walking through a living catalog, but nothing helps.  Finally, Jack turns to support groups, visiting under false names and crying about diseases and afflictions he doesn't have.Just as he starts to get his life to a tolerable state, 'she' starts getting involved in the groups.  'She' refers to Marla Singer, a trashy looking girl played by Helena Bonham Carter ('Hamlet'), who has a certain aura of Sadie Burke around her (if you don't understand, read 'All the Kings Men'). Marla is a faker, like Jack, and Jack can't cry with another faker in the group. This leads the two of them to split up the seven support groups among themselves, and they each get each other's numbers. Now, Jack works for a transportation company and he has to make trips about accidents or other problems with vehicles.  One of his trips leads him to meet Tyler Durden, an egotistical young soap salesman who is intrigued by Jack's cleverness.  When Jack goes back home to his condo, he finds that his room is now a pile of smoking rubble.  Needless to say, Jack needs help and calls upon Tyler, played by Brad Pitt ('Interview With a Vampire') for shelter in a run-down large house. One of the most powerful scenes in the film comes when Tyler and Jack sit down at a bar and discuss the way that life works.  The conversation inside concludes with a statement by Tyler: 'The things you own end up owning you.' Then they take their talk outside, where Tyler asks Jack to hit him, after which they get into a full-fledged, good-natured fight.This inspires the two of them to create the titular organization of 'Fight Club', which becomes a haven for guys who want to, well, fight.  The first rule: you do not talk about fight club.  The movie then follows the evolution of the club and a romance involving Tyler and Jack with Marla as the center of attention.  And everything goes smoothly. Until Tyler takes it too far. 'Fight Club' is one of the cooler-looking movies I've seen this year. It's not my favorite, but it certainly was amazing in certain perspectives. The narration by Jack was, as said before, often hilarious.  It constantly shows us the thoughts of Jack, and they're always interesting.  There are a lot of cool flashbacks, interesting shots (such as a zooming out close-up of a filled trashcan), and weird thoughts (Jack's cave and his power animal).This movie was not without drawbacks.  I felt that some of the scenes were unnecessary and could have stood to be taken out.  Plus, some of Tyler's actual antics bothered me quite a bit (but don't miss the pigeon thing). Also, this may not be a movie for girls, as it is more of an action movie than anything and makes itself quite clear that it is made for males. However, Tyler's basic philosophies kept me captivated.  He holds many of the same views that I do.  I especially like his statement from the previews:  'We've all been raised by television to believe we'd all be rock stars and movie gods.but we won't.' So, feel free to watch this movie if you can.  I would say that it is worth the five or six bucks for a ticket.  In the meantime, I shall be making and selling soap.",Null,0,1,2 January 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Johnny Depp...coming back!
","'Johnny Depp?' 	'Yeah.  Heard of him?' 	'No. What was his most recent film?' 	'Ummmm.I think.'Nightmare on Elm Street.'  He played the kid who got eaten by the bed.' 	'Oh, yeah!  Himyeah, I guess soHey, he was also Edward Scissorhands!'	 	'REALLY?'	This conversation may have been slightly exaggerated, but as a whole it could certainly be possible.  No offense to you Depp fans out there, but Johnny hasn't exactly been setting standards in Hollywood.  He seems to me to be rather reclusive or selective or what have you.  Mr. Depp has not appeared in a great deal of films which have been widely accepted by the public, and after 'The Astronaut's Wife' fell, some wondered if he ever would have a career. 	However, all of this may be ready to change.  Johnny Depp has just appeared as the main character in a box office hit that came out the week before Thanksgiving of 1999: 'Sleepy Hollow.'  This film may be the stepping stone he needs. 	'Sleepy Hollow' is a wonderfully dark film by Tim Burton (as if he does anything besides dark films), which is based on the Ichabod Crane story by Washington Irving.  Depp plays Ichabod, a constable in 18th century New York, whose scientific means of criminology are alien to the old school torture lovers who are his compatriots.  He is sent to investigate three murders in a small town called Sleepy Hollow (hence the name). 	There he meets up with the Van Tassells, a rich family who practically owns the town.  Crane also runs into Mr. Van Tassells' mysterious daughter Katrina, played by Christina Ricci ('Casper').  Ricci is one of the few actresses whose career I have watched throughout my life.  It's always interesting to watch Wednesday Addams and the nice girl from Casper go on to star in 'The Opposite of Sex,' but anyway 	Ichabod is informed of the situations of the murders by five important men of various occupation.  A little back-story is included, where the origin of the horseman is revealed.  An interesting trivia fact is that the growling Hessian horseman is played by Christopher 'always playing a villain' Walken ('Pulp Fiction').  Afterwards, the shaking Depp tells his informers in true Shatner-like speech that 'the killeris a man of flesh and blood, and I willdiscover him.'  And so the search begins. 	As Depp is preparing, we see Jonathan Nesmith, one of the citizens of the town, get chased down and decapitated by the horseman, whom we now see. After this tragedy, Jonathan's son decides to avenge his father by helping Ichabod.  More heads get cut off, and more violence ensues, until Ichabod, Katrina, and the Nesmith boy go to a huge, strange looking tree in the forest.  It is discovered that the tree bleeds, and inside of it are all the heads that the horseman has collected.  More importantly, the Hessian's skull is missing, and it is immediately deducted that whoever has the skull is controlling him.  Pure genius. 	They don't have much time to sit around and think, though, for as it gets dark, the Headless Horseman flies out of the tree on his steed and heads out to get another victim.  Even more violence ensues, and more heads roll, but names shall not be given to protect the ending.  Aside from the regular plot, the audience is often given flashbacks which help illuminate Crane's childhood, and explain how he thinks nowthe effect is amazing. 	This movie is rated R only for violence: no profanity, and only one slightly suggestive scene (with nothing actually seen).  There is blood and bone galore in this film, the presence of which is heightened by the sheer darkness of the film.  The choreography of the killing scenes is astounding, especially the sword play, which I can't even begin to describe.  It can only be seen. 	Other plusses: good acting, good setting, not too modernized, and Christina Ricci is hot.  Some minuses: it may freak out some people, it may trouble the weak of stomach, and it may bring back bad memories for those who have already been attacked by a Headless Horseman.  However, the biggest minus is the movie's cruel and unforgiving portrayal of the skull-deficient among us. Headless people well definitely be offended by this awful stereotype, but apparently this movie is not attempting to appeal to them. 	Instead, it appeals to everybody who likes a good action movie, a good mystery, a good drama, Tim Burton, or anybody who loves dark movies.  I know I do, and I loved this movie (Johnny Depp shall live again!).  So go to the theater, watch 'Sleepy Hollow,' and revel in your blissbut don't lose your head.",Null,0,0,11 January 2000
American Psycho," 99% brilliant
","I saw this movie when it first came out, and there were over twenty people in the theater, including me and my friend.  By the time it was over, it had fallen to six, but we both thought that the film was, as a whole, a masterpiece.  Yesterday, I rented it for the first time (since no one else will ever check it out) and watched it with another of my friends.  Once again, totally blown away.This IS indeed among the most underrated films to come out.  It's got an amazing cast, amazing acting by the cast, and beautiful locations.  On the other hand, it's one of the most gratuitous movies I've ever seen.  Doesn't bother me in any way, but it's very easy to see why the Oscar committee might run and hide.  One look at the threesome sex scene, and they were hiding under their seats.The true beauty of this film comes out in the acting of Christian Bale, a virtual unknown.  True, he had held a bit part in 'Pocahontas' and the role of that kid Jack in 'Newsies', but I doubt he'd want us to talk about that. The role of the psychotic, yet well organized Patrick Bateman came almost immediately after him being in a role as far to the other side of the spectrum as possible...Jesus.  His incredible breadth is shown throughout such tense scenes as the business card showdown, the hilarious phone message ('I just had to kill a lot of people!'), and the disturbingly funny murder of Paul Allen, done to a personal review of Huey Lewis and the News.The one problem, the very ending.  This second time, I figured out what was really going on, but it took me a damn long time.  I'll probably end up watching it again today...just to make sure I was completely right.  Still, I can stand up and say 'I completely understand the ending to American Psycho!', and people will respond 'What are you talking about?'",8,1,2,30 October 2001
Resident Evil," 'Take him to the nemesis project.'
","Bollicks to you, Glacier.  You talk as if a midget with brass knuckles was punching you in the balls during the duration of the movie.  I'll agree with anyone who says this film wasn't art, but it was NOT a bad movie.  I'm not gonna nominate it for an Oscar, but it was entertaining, and much more so than 'Tomb Raider.' And before we get into the 'you don't know the game' issue, let it be known that I am a diehard fanatic of the Resident Evil series, having played all of the games, owning two, and having beaten both '2' and 'Veronica'.  The game itself consists of walking around rooms being frightened by sounds, and very often there isn't much zombie fighting involved.  Granted, ninja kicks to the heads of Dobermans forced my eyebrow to rise a little, but I let it pass, especially once they showed the Licker (only complaint I have is that such a weak character would be made into the 'boss').  The special effects weren't great, and I found myself chuckling to myself at the sight of the zombies, but what got me into the film was the constant ambience.  It played just like the game, with more moments where you're scared of the silence than gunplay against approaching zombies.  As for accuracy to the game, it's not all there (if it was, they'd be able to hold eight guns at a time, and eat plants to cure their wounds), but as it is a prequel, it doesn't have much to stick to anyway.  The beginning introductions were accurate, and the ending was seamless, as well as being extremely creepy. And while I had expected to hate this movie, as video game transitions typically suck eggs (i.e. Super Mario Bros), I was very pleasantly surprised, and while I can't repeat enough that I wasn't blown away by the depth or artistry involved with the film, it was a good, mindless, lets-shoot-the-hell-out-of-some-zombies movie.  And if this series which seems like it's gonna sprout is true AND chronological, it's only gonna get cooler.  Anyone who remembers a specific line from the end of the movie, and knows what it's referring to...you know I'm right.",8,0,0,22 March 2002
