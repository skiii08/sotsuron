The Ring," Eerrh..wow..I..was..eerrhh..scared
","I hope the obvious sarcasm wasn't wasted on anyone. I ordered a ticket for the 'Premier Surprise', which had the tag line, 'massive hit in USA', hoping it was 8 Mile a friend and I took the deal.After 5 minutes I wondered if I could get my money back (from the small talk around me, seemingly I wasn't alone in that thought). From the boy, who is a clear 'Sixth Sense'-rip-off to the heavily inspired filming and cinematography from Blair Witch, this movie was a huge disappointment. I admit the 'Horror-genre' has it tough, it's now easy making one that's critically acclaimed, but I have found out it's all about feel and mood. Films like 'The Shining', 'The Exorcist', and 'The Kingdom' have that great creepy feel, which, even if you don't get scared, just shows the best of genre, and is a joy to watch.The Ring doesn't have it. It made me laugh a couple of times, when being to thick to take serious. I voted it 3, because I have seen worse horror-flicks. But the hopeless copying of other films, and a plot full of holes and errors can't swing it up to more.",3,0,0,30 November 2002
Live Free or Die Hard," As a generic action flick it passes, as the Die Hard 4 it fails
","The Die Hard dynasty is the definition of the heroic anti-hero. John McClane is a hero by accident. He is forced to be a hero, not because he is inclined to be one.This is why I, and others, distinguish between Die Har 1&3 and Die Hard 2. And without telling to much, I now put number 4 in the series in the latter category.I'll tell you why.... John McTiernan had the right take on it, and you see it in both the 1 and 3. He doesn't treat John McClane as a hero, he treats him as an ordinary guy, albeit a bad-ass type of ordinary guy. This is what makes Die Hard ultra cool. - Bruce Willis kicking ass and cracking jokes. If you hit him he falls over, bleeds, but gets up again, retaliates ending in fatality, and a snide remark.Number 2 made him too much of a generic hero, and Live Free or Die Hard aka Die Hard 4.0 has a bit of the same problem. John McTiernan made a balanced gourmet (action)meal, in the proper serving size. 4.0 struggles with the same as you do, when you try to recreate the meal you just had. You liked it, so you make a double portion, and because you liked certain elements, you add extra of that. And the result of that is always the same, it's OK, but not as good as you had, because it's out of proportion and after gorging on it, you suddenly feel you've had too much, spoiling it all a bit.Although John McClane in 4.0, is very vocally underlined as not being the heroes hero. The rest of the movie portrays him as such. Everything is a little bit extra, and little big bigger, and a bit more explosive. Sometimes you wonder if the director was thinking, 'and then here it would be nice with another explosion, maybe John bleeding a bit more'.Live Free or Die Hard goes a long way with the template and the pedigree, but because of it's eager to give a little bit more of everything, it stops short of giving the same cool feel as the John McTiernans.As an action flick though, it's exciting and keeps you entertained most of the time. It does get a little long towards the end, and some of the mushy elements, gets well... a little too mushyAll in all, it's worth seeing, and you should take a hide during the summer to do just that. Because Bruce Willis is good company. Even if you do miss the John McClane of the past millennium.",7,36,72,1 July 2007
