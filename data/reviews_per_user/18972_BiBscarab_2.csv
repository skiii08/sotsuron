","Typical user comment about this film...'The last 5 minutes of this film are truly terrifying',(They weren't) Well what about the previous 95 minutes?. Strip this movie down and you have a few students running around in a wood with a camera. Sounds too simplified? well sorry but thats basically it apart from a few sound effects. Theres nothing to be scared about. 'Plays with your imagination'......??? OH MY GOD I'VE JUST SEEN SOMETHING!....it's a ........Tree and theres ......another one....and its ........Dark ARRRGGHH! somebody's just re-arranged some rocks it MUST be supernatural, Gimme a break. People who were scared by this Crap must be scared of their own shadow. Gotta go somebodys just re-arranged my milk bottles outside, could it be......the milkman?, wheres my camcorder?",1,12,22,10 August 2002

","O.K here we go....Val Kilmers portrayal of the terminally ill Doc Holliday...SUPERB. The tension in this film grips you right from the very beginning and never lets up,although it never builds up to a particular climactic scene because the Film's littered with them. The build up to the O.K corral scene is intense and i must point out that the 5 seconds before the shoot out is edge of the seat stuff,as you can see by the look in the clanton gang's eyes that all hell is about to be let loose. Yes this film delivers.....Great acting,Action,Top notch cast,Memorable dialogue,etc..etc..Definitive Western,get it now!!!",Null,0,0,1 November 2001
