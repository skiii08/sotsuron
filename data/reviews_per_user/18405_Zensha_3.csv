Requiem for a Dream," Perfect Artwork, Good Acting, Average Story, Bad Storytelling
","Finally got to watch this movie after such a long time.Let me begin with this: You will hardly find any other 5/10 stars review for this movie, this is a love or hate movie for most and I will try to elaborate why it is so without spoiling it too much.SPOILER ALERT: I wouldn't really call them spoilers since I won't be talking about any details. But I will be saying things like 'the ending is good/bad' so please stop reading if you don't want to see any of that.In short, it is exactly what my summary says: Perfect Artwork, Good Acting, Average Story, Bad Storytelling.If you are looking for a masterpiece of an artwork, this is the one. Tragically beautiful, and great choice of style and film score. For a 2000 movie, it is almost a 10/10 in this aspect.Acting was really closer to average for most characters, but Ellen Burstyn's performance alone is more than enough to make up for any blemishes. I would even suggest anyone to watch the movie just for her acting.Now comes the bad bit:The story is absolutely nothing new. It's simply a confirmation of what most people already knew: drugs are bad for you. And that's fine. But the major downside of this movie is that it stops at that (drugs are bad). The characters have absolutely no depth to them. The movie shows close to nothing about their inner struggles and compelling reasons behind taking drugs. They are simply a portrayal of a stereotypical druggie, nothing more; nothing less.What can a person learn from this movie? Nothing at all. Unless you haven't already heard about drugs being bad for you? If you already know drugs are bad, perhaps this movie can remind you that drugs are really really bad, and that's it. No solution, no depth, no hope.Like I said, it's a beautiful piece of tragic artwork, but absolutely nothing inspirational and nothing new to learn about. Avoid it like a plague if you enjoy transcendental and inspirational movie, but definitely do give it a shot if you are all about arty farty Shakespeare kind of movies.Personally I regret watching it, because there is nothing educational or entertaining about the movie; just makes the world seems more gloomy that's all.",5,2,3,14 October 2015
Sicario," A story that could have been told in a few sentences
","The plot feels realistic. But perhaps a little too realistic that it feels more like a broadcast from a news channel instead of a movie. Any story can be summarized into a synopsis and told within a few sentences, and Sicario made me feel like it's more of a synopsis than a full-length movie, mainly due to the lack of character development and plot details.***Spoiler Alert***Similar to what some of the reviewers have already mentioned, I found myself questioning throughout the entire film why Blunt's role was even necessary (her acting was good though). They could have had Toro play the main character and added more depth to him. And even if they did need to pick a domestic agent, surely a more suitable person for the job would be an agent who would be more likely to agree to their unconventional methods, instead of a door-kicking naive girl who gets in the way all the time.And why was here a need for Blunt to point a gun at Toro outside the tunnel when she didn't even know what the hell was going on? That was all in all a really silly decision to make. What about the bodies in the house? Was there a need to go through the trouble of hiding them behind the walls?Too much time was spent on Blunt's character, which wasn't really going anywhere at all. Much more could have been done if the script was written better. I give it a 6 because firstly the acting was decent. Toro and Blunt was great, but I couldn't take Brolin seriously at all. I guess they were trying to make him into a hard ass character who never failed to laugh when everyone else looked dead serious, but to me he was just plain annoying. And secondly the movie felt like an accurate depiction of real life issues, which I found quite educational.",6,1,3,16 February 2016
Vanilla Sky," Breaks your heart into a million pieces
","I was so heart-broken after watching this film that it literally took weeks for me to get this movie out of my head. I've watched a fair share of tragic romance but nothing came close to touching my heart as much as Vanilla Sky did. Titanic? Not a chance!I often judge how good a film is based on how much emotion it evokes, and it is no exaggeration in saying that this is a true masterpiece that burrows deep into one's heart and toys with the emotions you thought you never had. Loneliness, regrets, longing, you name it. It's simply inexplicable.I watched this film years ago, but here I am, still getting this tingling sensation while I'm typing this and listening to the soundtrack (Sigur ros - The nothing song). I want to watch this again so badly, but don't think my aging heart can withstand another heartbreak.",10,0,0,20 December 2017
