Blade Runner 2049," Ponderous and Overbearing
","So I'm not going to spoil anything and enough reviews have gone into some detail so I won't waste to much time on specifics.Just coming off an evening of watching the original ('The Final Cut') and this back to back.First let me say the original stands up quite quite well. Most jarring are the car effects and the presence of pay phones and absence of smart phones. :) Second... Wow... This sequel is visually stunning, captures a lot of the feel of the original but is way too much, way too slow, and way too loud! It is probably the first film where I have said it could have used a little dynamic range compression.Anyhow let's just say my 7 probably could have become an 8+ with some tighter editing and about 20-30 minutes on the cutting room floor.I think people giving this a 9 or 10 and gushing praise are a vocal minority. Fine film but with some post production flaws and no masterpiece, at least not yet. Maybe a 'Final Cut' will save it?",7,3,8,21 October 2017
Frozen," Disappointing.
","First of all let me say I am completely basing my impression on proper context. I am a reasonable student and fan of animation in general and many Disney, musical style, movies in particular. For example I rate 'Mulan' and 'Tangled' quite highly. Also a big fan of 'Lilo & Stitch' and 'Finding Nemo'.Anyhow it is tough to define what didn't work here. I just watched it and had high expectations from the hype so that may have set me up for a let down. I would say the biggest items are a weak dialogue and a few jarring plot items or twists that jar me out of my suspension of disbelief.Probably the biggest one is the whole Elsa flight and ''Let it Go' montage. This was broken on a few levels.First the good. The music is a reasonably catchy, pop power ballad and the visuals are well executed. However the whole premise is what ripped me out of the mood in the first place. How in the world has a young sorceress, who has repressed her powers basically her whole life and been completely untrained, able to craft the fortress of solitude etc. on the first try? One grants fantasy lots of things but if she cannot control her power to the extent of randomly freezing things mere hours before, where does the precision come from to craft high art and animate things? Maybe if she had been secretly training with the trolls for 10 years. Also why in the world the parents though it was a good idea to closet her away instead of finding some trainer is beyond me. Sigh...Next was the almost giggling funny transformation from the regal attire to some sort of rather, well, shall we say sexy outfit. Apparently just revelling in the girl power, but it seemed strange and out of place.Another minor irritant is the somewhat tiring, and sudden, appearance of the *another* comic relief... snowman? Also why the rather diabolus ex machina of the bad prince near the end. I know it set up the sacrifice but that could have been done is a less contrived way.Well I hope I'm not coming across a demanding too much. I've got caught up in many other Disney offerings and not felt as let down; for example 'Brave' was an overall better offering in spite of that film's weaknesses.",5,5,12,22 May 2014
The Adjustment Bureau," Well worth the time to watch - Great Scifi - Romance Blend
","I will fully admit pushing this from a pretty solid 8 to a 9 because I think it was a little underrated.If you liked Edge of Tomorrow you will like this. I think Emily Blunt has a bit of a niche in Sci-Fi Romance nailed here. Chemistry between Blunt and Damon is nice and I always like Terence Stamp.As an aside I always hesitate watch Matt Damon movies because I think he will annoy me but he always sucks me in... in a good way. I think I conflate him with Brad Pitt which is unfortunate.I marked this as spoiler because it could have worked either way as a sad or uplifting ending and I think what made me jump it up to a nine was because, heck, we all deserve a happy ending once in a while!",9,0,3,2 September 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Pretty Disappointing...
","I am not sure why I gave this a six. It probably deserves less. Maybe some of the acting was decent and at least there was no Jar-Jar Binks; although the stereotype Eastern 'grandma' was rather painful (however, mercifully, she did not tag along).As has been mentioned many times this is not a sequel but a *remake * or reboot of IV. One or two references might be considered an homage but the whole plot was basically lifted.Also CGI battle scenes are over the top as usual in the last several outings.I've now been fooled twice into seeing the start of a 'new' Star Wars trilogy in the theatre. Shame on me. The last two will be in watch on a library disc or Netflix category...",6,23,33,3 January 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Rather Bad and Ultimately Boring and Forgettable
","OK so first of all I'm not some sort of squeamish viewer who is panning this movie because of the comic book violence. Heck I quite liked flicks like '300' and 'Kick-Ass'. This film just doesn't know what to do with the tone and, similar to most movies these days, actually bores the audience with interminable action scenes and CGI. I actually checked my watch on the church brawl, yawn... I would have loved a good spy flick parody but this was just sad. There were a few good performances and the odd good laugh, and I really wanted to like it, but it is pretty much a mess in the end. If you haven't already seen it in the theatre give it a miss and catch it on streaming, rental, etc.As for the IMDb rating, what the heck? 8.2!! #238 at the time I write this??!! Top 250 material this is not! The shill review corps is working overtime on this one.",3,10,21,28 March 2015
