The Monuments Men," No Monuments Were Saved in the Making of this Movie
","In 2014 'The Monuments Men' directed by George Clooney was released, starring a questionable group of men tasked with the mission of rescuing artworks stolen by the Nazis. During World War Ⅱ, U.S. President Roosevelt (Michael Dalton) ordered these men with the mission of making sure the art treasures of the Western World survive the war; this army unit comprised of seven curators, museum directors, and art historians. With the help of members of the French Resistance, such as the French art historian Claire Simone (Cate Blanchett), these men carried out the task of recovering and delivering the masterpieces to their rightful owners. This group of remarkable men would eventually suffer the loss of two members, Donald Jeffries (Hugh Bonneville) and Jean Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin); instead of this causing their resolve to falter it strengthened the men and their belief that their mission was worth carrying onwards. After the Nero Decree was issued by Hitler (James Payton) on the 19th of March the Monuments Men had to go into overdrive, not only did they have to recover the millions of pieces of art stolen by the Nazis but also retrieve them before the Russian equivalent troops seize the artworks with no intention of returning them. While the dialogue of the film is captivating, there are two recurring underlying messages. The general argument in the film is that during war that the missions should not be an either/or stance,that it is both equally important to save both the people and their culture. While some argue that these men should have been more involved with aiding the Allies in stopping the Holocaust, they were not men that were going to change anything the tide in that battle, but they could preserve who they were as a people. This is best demonstrated in the movie when one of the men returns a stolen painting to the empty house of a Jew, simply because it belonged there. The other central theme was whether a soldier's life is worth risking and potentially losing over a painting or a statue. The director, through the compelling stories of bravery of the men, makes a strong case for the belief that saving the world is about more than just saving its people. This movie is precious to me; the saving of art is equally as important as the saving the people. In the beginning fifteen minutes of the movie George Clooney's character states that, 'Your lives are more important than a piece of art,' and it was not until the death of two team members that he realized this was not the case. His voice overlaps the scene of Jean Claude's death and his earlier opinion of their cause is changed when he expresses, 'No piece of art was worth a mans life. But these last months have proved me wrong. This is our history and it is not to be stolen or destroyed. It is to be held up and admired.' During war towns will fall and people will die but who we are as humans must survive. Our achievements are important and are worth protecting no matter the cost.",10,0,0,23 June 2014
Lone Survivor," Not Even Death Could Have Killed Him
","On the 10th of January 2014, a movie hit the theaters that would leave everyone in the crowd shocked, crying, and filled with pride. This movie is Lone Survivor directed by Peter Berg and based off of a series of true events that were put into a book written by Marcus Luttrell, the only survivor of tale. The movie starts off with real footage of United States Navy SEALs boot camp and everything it takes to make it before they are granted the honor of calling themselves a Navy SEAL. The focus is then shifted to the mission presented to the unit which is a Taliban leader Ahmad Shah (Yousuf Asami) who is responsible for the death of over twenty United States Marines, as well as any villager or refugee who was aiding the American forces. In response to these deaths, a United States Navy SEALs unit was ordered to execute a counter-insurgent mission to capture or if needed take out Shah. The team assigned to the mission comprised of four SEALs: team leader Michael P. 'Murph' Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), snipers Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg) and Matthew 'Axe' Axelson, and communications specialist Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch). The team is flown into the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan, where they must make a trek through several mountains in order to arrive at their designated location, a small town miles away that Shah has overtaken. Along the way they find themselves accidentally discovered by an elderly shepherd and his two teenage grandchildren; one of which clearly shows his hatred of the U.S. SEALs and it thus assumed to have Taliban connections. After a heated conversation between the SEALs they agree to let the unarmed men go and quickly backtrack into the mountains in hopes of getting coms up for extraction. However, no matter how far they backtracked it wasn't enough and they were confronted with hundreds of Taliban men armed with rocket launchers, full auto rifles, and countless grenades. The next hour of the film turned into one of the longest and most intense ground force combat scenes of the last decade. Each of the men suffers serious injuries during the gunfight from jumping off the edges of cliffs, at least five gun shot wounds each, and countless broken bones. In the end, all but Marcus Luttrell lives to tell the tale of the brave men, both navy SEALs and the villagers that aided him in his escape. The movie wrapped up with a four minute montage of videos and pictures of the real men involved with this tale as well as an epilogue to what happened to the survivors afterwards. The overarching theme of this movie is what the will to survive can drive a person to do as well as what the hope to make change happen can make a person risk in order to see it done. The men in this story take an unimaginable amount of damage to their bodies and are still able to take out about ⅓ of the Taliban forces themselves. Such bravery is demonstrated when Danny Dietz treks up a hillside swarmed with Taliban in order to get the coms up, alerting the base of their location. On top of earlier injuries, he is shot six times before making it to the top and the final shot caused Dietz to fall to his knees, but no further, he did not fully fall to the Taliban, even in death. The other theme of this movie is the drive to make change happen as well as the overwhelming kindness of a people. Towards the end of the movie Marcus was found by a local Pashtun village leader, Mohammad Gulab (Ali Suliman), who takes in Marcus and attempts to nurse him back to health. After a few days the Taliban arrive with the mission to execute Marcus, but were driven away by Gulab and the villagers. However, they planned on coming back in full force with Shah leading the assault. Gulab knows that they cannot hold Shah's forces for long, so he sends an unidentified mountain man to hike the fifty plus mile journey to the nearest American air base. Why did these people risk everything to help an American SEAL who has taken the lives of their fellow brethren? Because the villagers of that town were bound to help Marcus as part of a traditional code of honor known as Pashtunwali, a true act of selflessness that Marcus could never fully repay. This movie stunned everyone in the theater I was in. During the montage and epilogue at the end, not one person got up to leave; everyone was still as a mountain, and tears were cascading down everyone's face--even the toughest of men were not afraid to cry. We witnessed a movie that could only show a glimpse into the bravery that those men had, and that small glimpse was more than any of us thought possible for a human being to muster.",10,1,2,23 July 2014
