The Blair Witch Project," deep forest
","i lived in one little village for three years. i was 14 then. i remember the horror i felt while i was passing by  the dark forest. i was affraid of dogs, big cats( in my language it is dzudzan some kind of wild cat) and crazy people wondering around. when i watched this movie i remembered the days when i had to go directly throught forest. after seeing this movie i would never be the same person while walking in the forest. well today i live in the relativly big city and i am not afraid of forests.for those people who are not afraid of this movie: try to walk in the forest and think about this movie and you'll be affraid of every sound forest make, and than cames shadows... your mind is trying to explain it ( what is that), heart is pumping faster... in those moments i prayed for God to help me. God help everybody who is alone in the forest 10/10",10,2,3,25 January 2002
Akira," Blood, details and boring
","First: This movie is full of BLOOD. Blood on the street, face... So if you are fan of bloody movies see this, also if you like SF you should see this movie. For me the begining of the movie is great, middle is good but boring, an d the end is little stupid for me (transformation to big creature on stadium). I watch this but only once 5/10",8,9,18,27 October 2002
The Others," Boring like sixth sence
","This movie is boring like sixth sence. I cannot like this movie because of good ending and four good old scares. one scene with old lady scares me to death, BUT that is almost everything. photography  is great, scene selection also, actors are great, but movie is too long.This movie is better than Sixth sence6/10",10,0,1,23 April 2002
