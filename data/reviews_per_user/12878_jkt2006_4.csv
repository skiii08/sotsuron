First Man," Brilliant direction, script and performances!
","Loved every minute of this biopic. Felt throughout that I was with the main character Neil Armstrong and what he felt, went through and achieved. Awesome direction, script and Ryan Gosling's performance. Claire Foy doesn't disappoint either",8,2,2,24 July 2019
Bird Box," Was good not great
","It was well directed, and performed but that's where it ends. Leaves too many questions unanswered not only at the end but during the entire length as well. Was overall a painful movie to watch with all characters going through the suffering during the entire length of the movie. May be not my type of a movie...But as I said the direction and performances are totally up to the mark",6,0,2,21 January 2019
Uri: The Surgical Strike," Good job done by the team!
","Well written, directed by Aditya Dhar. Was not expecting it to be this well scripted and executed. Vicky Kaushal and Mohit Raina do a great job and needless to say Paresh Arawak who excels as usual. I would say one of the best Indian war/ military movies ever made, well so far.",8,1,3,21 January 2019
3 Idiots," The worldwide gross is now above US$80 million
","This movie was the masterpiece of 2010 from the new breed of Hindi cinema from India. This movie is one fine example of what good, awesome, entertaining cinema can do to you. The movie, once it is into its first 15 minutes doesn't let you move an inch, then on a roller coaster ride it makes you laugh, cry, laugh ,then cry again and then the wonderful climax, the ride is just amazing. Wonderful direction, absolutely wonderful performances, lovely cinematography, the gorgeous Kareena and other wonderful actors make it all worthwhile. The movie made a total gross of US$80 million worldwide, a big one for a Hindi movie, is still selling the DVDs and Blurays, although many Hindi movies have begun to cross US$20-30 million in gross collections now. If you believe in A class, cinema in its splendor kind of entertaining movies, do not miss it. IMDb editors need to look at the worldwide gross as well in case of non-US blockbusters like this one and not only the US domestic gross which states it as US$6 million plus here for this movie. A good no. of Indian films now gross over $20-30 million US dollars, sometimes worldwide, sometimes in India domestic market alone. Please ensure to get the worldwide figures to present the correct picture. Also, India happens to be worlds second largest movie loving and movie selling market on the planet, next to the USA. Hoping you will listen. Thankyou.",9,1,3,22 December 2010
