The Legend of Bagger Vance," The Greatest Movie Ever
","One of the best golf movies ever. Matt Damon did a great job trying to find that special, authentic swing that everyone has. Will Smith was great. He gave Damon great ideas and showed him if your not in control with yourself, you are not believing yourself. Sometimes, you just have to step back and take a look at the whole picture. Playing with professionals is scary at first, but then, something comes outside of you and you need to perform at the very best. Robert Redford, the director, showed what the game of golf really is. People don't give enough respect to this game which is not right. I am a golfer myself, and the biggest thing that helped me was that I knew that I just had to find myself. I want everybody reading this to go watch this fantastic film.",Null,1,3,12 September 2002
Days of Thunder," NASCAR Comes To Life
","Tom Cruise did an incredible job. The movie was based on the NASCAR series which was a great idea. Lots of people out there don't understand racing, but after watching this particular movie, you will begin to appreciate everything that it has to offer. Nicole Kidman did an amazing job as well. The concepts were done creatively and made it show the life that racers have to go through. It's a matter of life and death sometimes. Recommend this to people that love NASCAR.",Null,0,1,1 November 2002
Dumb and Dumber," Great Job By Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels
","This movie is a classic for everyone. I've seen it like a hundred times, and not gotten sick of it yet. The more you watch it, the better the jokes become. Story was hilarious and the actors were amazing. The cast was great and incredible soundtrack. The dialogues are unforgettable and make you laugh all the time. I totally recommend this film to be watched by everybody. My friend Josh and I are trying to act out all of the scenes for our friends at school during the day. It's a movie that really put Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels on the top of the charts for comedian roles.",10,0,0,31 October 2002
The Matrix," Computer World Meets Reality
",Keanu Reeves was the man. Awesome theme music during selected scenes. Intriguing dialogues between characters. The action sequences were outstanding in that they spent quite a long time on showing it from every angle possible. Lawrence Fishbourne did a fabulous job as well. The cast was extraordinary. I was strongly recommend buying this film on DVD because of the sound and picture quality that you will get. It will change your scope on the world tremendously. The dangster gives it a perfect rating.,10,0,1,1 November 2002
