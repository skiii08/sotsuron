The Blair Witch Project," The best horror movie I have ever seen
","I am a big fan of horror movies and I'm not easily scared but this movie scared me.  For starters, it looks so real.  Theres no phony fake effects and theres no computer generated images (Cgi).  CGIs, though they may be good, can easily be distinguished from real images.  Not only does it look real almost everywhere you look (for example, the web site) there's something trying to convince you that it is real.  In fact many people function under the misconception that it is real.  There was no script so the dialogue and actions were those of the actors.  They literally went out into the woods and the producers and crew harassed them.  You can visibly see the break down of humanity among them.  The complained about jerky camera movements are like that because these people aren't professional camera people.  They did just what anyone else would do when they got chased while holding a camera.  They ran and didn't bother to keep it perfectly steady.  The legend is very intricate, there's even a video that you can rent that discusses the legend as if it were true.  I also have the video games which, believe it or not, furthers the legend.  Another thing that makes the movie so scary is that you never see what's doing it.  There's n o monster to attack, no psychotic that you can see.  Whatever it is it can be anywhere.  It's all around you, you're lost in the woods with no one to help you and no way to protect yourself.  That was the scariest thing about it, that you never knew where it was.  It could've been coming at them from anywhere and it has the power to kill you.  And it wants to kill you. Rent it, or better yet buy it.  You won't regret it.",Null,0,1,16 October 2001
