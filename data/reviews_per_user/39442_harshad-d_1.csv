Sucker Punch," Not a movie everyone would like
","There are movies which everyone loves, and then some which everyone hates. Sucker Punch cannot fall into either category-- its more like a film made by a geek for the geeks among us. From what you see in the opening sequence - the lead character being lead to the asylum - you get the feeling that this movie is done by a director who wanted to put in what he himself loved into the movie. The dark clouds, a very brooding arch with the name of the asylum on it, the stylized automobile...everything gives the scene a typical flavor. And you either get immediately attracted to it or you just get put off. Me, I was pulled magnetically! The movie has everything a geek loves - there's Steampunk, there's Fantasy and there's Sci-Fi. Running through all this are the lead girls-with-big- guns-and-swords and the amazing fight sequences. Its a totally fun movie. But if you go in for the movie looking for a reason or method to the mayhem, then you will come out feeling confused, disappointed and duped. Its a movie to be enjoyed just for the way it IS. No hidden meanings to be expected, nothing to be deduced. Everything is served the way it is, and you have to enjoy it in that spirit. Don't treat the movie like Wine--looking for all the hidden flavors and subtleties - but treat it like a shot of Vodka - just take it for what it is, shut up and feel the kick! And one solid kick it is, with the lovely girls, skimpy skirts, big explosions, massive fight sequences and amazing CGI. I went along with a non-geek friend and he didn't get it. But he found it entertaining. So before you go for the movie, think of what you are looking for.",7,11,17,27 March 2011
