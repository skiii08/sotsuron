Ali," I'd rather recieve a sharp blow to the head
","I went to this movie expecting an at least mildly entertaining film with some good fight scenes. I instead viewed a nearly unbearable piece of overhyped crap that was held together only by the fight scenes (which were, in all honesty, pretty cool). This disastrous film made it impossible for me to care at all about what happened to the main character, Muhammed Ali. If they had developed on one theme and perhaps exposed some respectable, likeable characteristics in the guy, instead of portraying him as this womanizing hypocritical boring ass, then perhaps it would have been possible to care about what happened to him. As it was, all I could care about was how much more time I had to sit through the painful dialogue and attempt at a plot. If you must see this movie, do yourself a favor, wait until it comes out on video and fast forward to the fight scenes.",3,1,1,22 January 2002
A Beautiful Mind," Only superficially beautiful
","While this film was certainly a well refined, polished product of the Hollywood film machine, I felt that it lacked real depth and purpose. There is nothing necessarily wrong with a film made to please audiences; it's the fact that this one insists on taking itself so seriously that irks me. Russell Crowe turned out a reasonably impressive performance, but If you want to see Jennifer Connelly show off her acting abilities to a far greater extent I'd recommend 'Requiem for a Dream'. The dialogue was slightly stiff and cliched, and the actual facts of the story were strained almost beyond recognition. However, the real flaw does not lie within the film itself, but rather the hype surrounding it. 'A Beautiful Mind' has been purported to be a great film of mind altering proportions, when in reality it is merely another flimsy product of audience appeasement. 'A Beautiful Mind' has no more depth than 'Ace Ventura, Pet Detective', although the latter surely lacks the arrogance.",Null,0,1,9 July 2002
