The Ring," Scary child
","The most scary aspect of this film is not the premise that you will die in 7 days time from watching the video (although that is quite cleverly done especially when you get to see the video) but the child actor Martin Henderson who plays Noah. Boy every time that child was on screen he scared the living willies out of me. I thought the kid from the Shining was bad, but if you are looking for totally creepiness check out Mr. Henderson.",Null,0,1,27 February 2003
