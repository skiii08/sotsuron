Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Boring at times, but ending makes up for it
","There was bound to be a sequel to the original Sherlock Holmes from 2009, seeing how much money it made, even with Avatar being released at almost the same time. And here it is,although I wouldn't really call it a sequel, because the old story is mentioned nowhere in the film.The film, like the old one, is full of gags and jokes involving mostly Holmes and an exasperated Watson, who should be on his honeymoon. These are all pretty funny, but the film does get boring around the middle, and you feel like you're just waiting for the climax. But when it does come you are rewarded for your patience. Again, like in the first film, Holmes uncovers Moriarty's plan to wreak havoc on the world, and stops him from executing it by throwing him off a cliff. But Moriarty pulls Holmes down with him. Everyone thinks he died, and Watson writes a book about him, honoring him as 'the best man of the law I have ever known'. I won't tell you the ending, it's a surprise and maybe the best part of the film.In conclusion, I don't think this is as good as the old one, but it's still enjoyable enough. I suggest you go see it if you haven't already, but don't expect to be blown away. Expect to be amused and entertained, but no more. If you do that, you'll enjoy it.",7,0,5,21 December 2011
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Definite improvement upon the Swedish version
","Let me just start by saying that I have both read the book and seen all three of the Swedish films, so going into the theater I knew what to expect. And I have only positive things to say. Sure, a lot of the scenes in this version resemble those in the Swedish one, but that was to be expected, wasn't it? I mean, both films are adapted from the same novel!About the film itself: As you might expect from an American remake with David Fincher behind the wheel the film is a lot more action packed and goes through events a little faster than the Swedish version. The cast is superb and very well picked, and the atmosphere throughout is very dense and isolated. As the story slowly unravels it becomes more and more gruesome and mysterious, and it grabs you and doesn't let go for the next hour and a half. Then what seems like the showdown arrives, but the real answer to the great mystery is even more surprising than you think, and it's something you couldn't have possibly thought of, but which, when you think about it later (as I'm doing now) is pretty much the only logical one. As the final scenes, which make the connection with the second book, play out you can't help but feel sad that it had to end so soon. SUMMARY FOR THOSE WHO DON'T FEEL LIKE READING THE ABOVE: This film is definitely better than the Swedish version, and its mystery has a way of gripping you and not letting you go until the end. You should see it.",8,4,11,28 January 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Excellent, almost equal to the first one
","I really wasn't expecting this to be this good, seeing how both parts 2 and 3 were so disappointing to me, but this is a very fast and enjoyable ride. The story is very linear with almost no diversions, as it is supposed to be in a mission:impossible movie,the script is well-written, the acting is also well-done (can you believe Tom Cruise is 50 years old?), the action is amazing, especially the scene in Dubai, which I think is one of the best action/operation scenes in film history. The film really pulls you in and does not let you go until the end. But of course there were also some bad points. One of those is the amount of way-too-advanced technology the they just seem to be able to pull out of their pockets so to speak. Also numerous times there is a 'deus ex machina' kind of thing, with people being saved just in time, that stuff. But other than that this is a very, very entertaining piece of filmmaking that any action fan can't miss, and which is almost equally entertaining to people who aren't necessarily action fans.To conclude: Good points: Good story, good script, good acting, great action,engaging. Bad points: too much too advanced technology, deus ex machina rescues",8,6,10,24 December 2011
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Very entertaining and with message
","This is the prequel to the 1968 sci-fi masterpiece, which shows us the very beginning and how the apes take over the world,It begins with a scientist, Will Rodman, who is developing a cure for Alzheimer's disease, which is made more interesting by the fact that his father has it, too. Anyway, he thinks he has it, but he decides to test it on apes first. It turns out to enhance the apes' brain capacity hugely, and they try to break out. The humans barely contain the breakout and kill all the apes, but one of them was pregnant and a baby ape is rescued by Will and taken home. Over the years Will and Caesar (the ape) grow a tight bond, but Caesar is growing up and when he attacks a person in the street he must be taken to a containment center. Behind the facade of the nice ape-playground there are cruel, small cages in which the apes are kept 23 hrs of the day. This hugely angers Caesar, and because he is almost as smart as a human, he crafts a plan. He manages to steal some of the Alzheimer's cure and give it to the other apes. Meanwhile the researchers find out the Alzheimer's cure is poisonous to humans, and when the apes break out they spread the virus around the world. This is where the movie ends.Besides being a very entertaining movie and very well acted by the not- so-famous cast, it also bears the message that we shouldn't experiment on animals, because all sorts of things could go wrong. If it's not out of the theater yet where you live, go see it. Whatever your taste, you will not be disappointed. Pinky-swear.",8,3,6,16 September 2011
The Theory of Everything," Entertaining, but Best Picture? No
","Movies in the ever-growing 'biopic' genre tend to focus solely on the lead actor/actress and his/her performance while neglecting important things like a memorable supporting cast, a well-written script, a good soundtrack, innovative cinematography, etc. Which is understandable because the Academy has always focused too much on the acting when awarding their Best Picture Oscar. 'The Theory of Everything' exhibits many of these flaws, but despite this it's very entertaining. Most of this entertainment comes from marveling at Hawking's story and Eddie Redmayne's painfully accurate portrayal of the debilitating effects of his muscle disease. It's certainly not worth a Best Picture Oscar, but your money won't be wasted on it.7/10",7,0,0,28 January 2015
The Mist," Terribly awesome, one-of-a-kind film
","Most Stephen King movies are good, some even awesome (Misery, Shawshank Redemption, Green Mile), and The Mist can count itself amongst those three. If you've read the book, you'll know how close the movie keeps to the book, but that's only good, because the book is so awesome (i'm a Stephen King fan too :). The fact that there's almost no music (apart from some music at the end, but that fits in perfectly) makes the atmosphere tense and makes the characters seem more realistic. The movie, far from being a run-of-the-mill horror flick, shows how people can lose their heads and turn to anyone who promises them savior (Mrs. Carmody). Apart from that frightening idea, there's also plenty of 'regular' horror, with about 3 bloody scenes. That may seem nothing compared to say Saw 3,which is basically one big bloody scene, but if there were too much blood no one would take it seriously, because (forgive me) those 'Other dimension creatures' are a bit too fake to believe. But the very best part of the movie is the terrible ending in which **HUGE FREAKING SPOILER** the main character, David, his son of 5, a woman he met at the supermarket, and two old people, one of which is his old elementary school teacher, are sitting in the car in which they had fled, which had run out of gas, and so they know that they're going to die because the Other dimension creatures are everywhere in the mist. David takes out his gun, which has 4 bullets in it but they are with five. He shoots the others, including his 5 year old son, while he really wanted to die himself too. He crawls out of the car, wanting to be killed by the creatures, but then the army come down the road. And the terrible truth occurs to you: he just killed 4 people, including his son, for nothing! With that thought, the movie is over. I remained dead still in my seat for 2 minutes. A masterpiece.",8,0,2,11 May 2011
The Imitation Game," 'The Imitation Game' trumps its rival
","'The Imitation Game' and 'The Theory of Everything' are two uncannily similar movies. They both tell astonishing tales of genius scientists, their monumental achievements and equally monumental hardships. They both feature excellent lead actors who give career-defining, Oscar-worthy performances. However, in almost every aspect, 'The Imitation Game' is just slightly better. Cumberbatch completely disappears into the role of Alan Turing, a genius mathematician who shortened World War II by two years by cracking the Germans' Enigma code along with a team of scientists. It would have been easy, and cliché, to spend a large amount of time on Turing's struggle with homosexuality, for which he was convicted in the early 1950s. But one of the biggest virtues of 'The Imitation Game' is that it portrays Turing's attitude to his sexuality exactly as it was: he never struggled with it, he simply accepted it for what it was. He was wholly devoted to his cause, and anything which stood in his way he would remove, to the point of marrying his team's only female member despite his homosexuality, because her parents would otherwise have ordered her to return to them.Because the movie is a biopic, it is inherently flawed. The reasons for this are that biopics tend to focus so much on the acting and the story that they neglect such things as soundtrack, cinematography, and script. These things are usually rushed and therefore imperfect. However, as biopics go, this is a good one.8/10",8,2,6,1 February 2015
The Adjustment Bureau," It was OK
","I have to admit, I had higher expectations of this movie when I went to see it, taking into account the fact that this kind of movie is really my kind. The idea of some kind of society controlling everything does always gets my attention. But after seeing it the conclusion is: It was OK, but could've been a lot better. It's the kind of movie you can only watch once without getting bored, but that one time will be an enjoyable one. Damon does good work as an almost-senator who falls in love with a pretty girl he met (weirdly enough) in the men's room, only to then be kidnapped by the adjustment bureau, which is the secret society that keeps the plans for every single person in the world, but he does anything to get to her, which (of course) happens. 7/10",7,0,0,12 April 2011
Super 8," Good movie, bad ending
","I'm writing this about 1 hour after I got out of the theater.I go to everything that Steven Spielberg had anything to do with, and I haven't yet been disappointed. And that didn't change with 'Super 8'. The story is set in the 1960's, five boys and a girl who are obsessed with making movies are going to shoot a scene at midnight at a train station. As they're shooting a car drives onto the tracks and collides with a passing train, causing a huge explosion. Having survived the crash they go over to the car that caused the crash and find their science teacher, severely injured, pointing a gun at them and telling them no to tell anyone, or THEY will kill them and their parents. This is where the movie takes off.The acting in this movie is really good given they're all just kids, and the grown-ups also do a good job. It's really noticeable that SS produced this movie, it's all perfectly made. That man has a great talent and I hope we'll be able to see much, much more of his work.Later in the movie we find out the train was an airforce train, which was carrying parts of an alien spaceship, and that the science teacher stopped the train to help the monster that hides below ground escape. The monster was locked up underground and is very angry, so when he can finally go aboveground he starts abducting random people, including the girl I talked about earlier. The boys (3 of them; one chickened out, the other has a broken leg), of course, go into the alien's lair to save her, which they manage, but then they are chased into a dead end underground tunnel passage. Joe, the main character, then bravely steps forward and convinces the alien to stop what he's doing.And then comes the bad part. There's just a huge gap of information. How was the alien suddenly able to build a ship when for 5 years he was unable to? That and the ending is incredibly cliché. If not for the ending the movie would have gotten an 8 from me. But don't blame SS, he's just the producer. It's the director's and the writer's fault.7/10",7,0,2,20 August 2011
Die Hard," An epic action classic
","First off, you should know that I rarely give out points higher than 8 (in fact, the only movie I've given a 10 yet is Pulp Fiction), so 9 is an incredibly high rating for my standards. This is a movie that changed the action genre forever, and since it's release there have been many copies of it. But anyway, back to the movie. Willis being a fairly unknown actor before Die Hard, this is the movie that launched his career, And it's understandable why. His acting is an important part of what makes this movie so epic, because many of the scenes feature just him, operating on his own against Gruber and his crew, and throwing out some incredibly funny lines when talking to Gruber and that black cop, who is by the way another important element of the movie. He's such a typical cop, lazy, eating donuts in the car, but when things get serious, he's alert and helpful. But finally, THE thing that makes this movie so awesome is the action. Action like we'd never seen it before back in '88, raw and uncompromising, spectacular and bloody. McClane (Willis) gets hurt and shot so often you find it hard to believe he can still walk, let alone run, but that doesn't matter. If you take this movie too seriously, you won't enjoy it. So, when you go watch this epic, just sit down and enjoy the action without thinking about it, because that's how it was meant to be watched.",9,1,2,11 May 2011
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Excellent, but falls short of being a masterpiece
","Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's 'Birdman' is a masterpiece on many levels. First of all, a very unusual camera technique is used to make the entire film feel like one continuous shot, which is very engrossing. Secondly, the soundtrack consists almost entirely of scattered, dissonant jazz percussion, which gives the film an unhinged feel. It really is on a level with the one in Kubrick's 'The Shining'. Thirdly, all of the lead actors give solid, occasionally great, performances.But what makes this film fall short of being a masterpiece, oddly enough, is Inarritu's directing and writing. The frequent use of surrealism is intriguing, but it doesn't seem to have much meaning or purpose. The story is thin and exists only in service of the performances. Nevertheless, 'Birdman' is an experience you will remember for some time, and I urge you to see it.8/10",7,1,7,25 January 2015
The Godfather," What can I say?
","I mean, really, what hasn't been said about this film yet? That's right, nothing, and so I'll now write a review that doesn't go anywhere.There are those that say this (or maybe pt2) is the best movie ever made, but I couldn't agree with that. One of the best, yes, but not the best. And then you have those who say it's overrated and boring. I think those people are just not used to extremely long movies anymore, and that's sad, because these people are missing out on some other awesome long movies (casino, GF 1,2,3, Heat, Once upon a time in the west, etc.) Anyway, back to the movie. It was the breakthrough for several great actors, including Marlon Brando, in the brilliant role of the compassionate but cruel Don Corleone, and Al Pacino of course, in the role of Michael, the Don's son who didn't want to take over the Corleone empire at first but in the end does anyway. When I fist sat down to see this movie it was with thoughts of 'overrated' and 'way too long', but the 2h55 just flew by, really. Though it was the longest movie I'd ever seen, it felt no longer than say Inception, which is 30min shorter and (in my opinion) a really boring movie, and at the end I couldn't wait for pt2, so it was a convenience that I had it standing right next to me in my DVD-rack.",10,0,1,16 May 2011
