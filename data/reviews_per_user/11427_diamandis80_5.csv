It," Underwhelming
","IT was underwhelming. I have not read the book and I barely remember the first movie, so I'm commenting on it as a standalone movie. I didn't like how IT's properties are not well defined. When can he appear and when not? Why did IT rip the first child's arm off with its teeth and then later was just french kissing the Jewish child instead of instantaneously ripping its face off? Were there no other children in that town (well, there were as we saw in the school scenes)? Why did IT pick this particular gang? How is it possible that children go missing every exactly 27 years and no one but the fat kid noticed the pattern? Too much suspension of disbelief for my tastes.
When the three kids entered the house, why did they wander off one by one when they knew what they were facing at this point? They're supposed to be scared. The natural response is to stick together. I hate nonsensical things like this in movies just to make for fake suspense. Since Bev was the only one willing to enter the house in the first place (did not raise her hand), why did she not go in with them? The scene were they leave one by one at the end was cringy and to Stand By Me-ish. Also, I think the fat kid had done enough in this movie to get the girl (that would have been original at least). Stutter boy was just going from one stupid decision to another the whole movie.I also didn't like the Goonies/Stranger Things atmosphere (made stronger by one of the kids being in Stranger Things) with the cliche rural America friendships, the bikes, the token girl and the token black or asian kid. It's been overdone and I loved it at its prime when I was about that age, but it needs to go away for a while again.",5,1,2,25 July 2018
Snatch," Without being inco-f***ing-spicuous ,WATCH THIS FILM!!
","I was afraid that the British humour in this movie would annoy me and bore me to death. However, I was surprised to discover that this is actually an extremely entertaining film. Some of the quotes I heard in it still linger in my mind. Especially the one where Brick-Top says inco-f***ing-spicuous. Hilarious!! This is the best European film I have seen since the German : Lola Rennt. It was also the first time I saw Vinnie Jones in any film and I have to say  that he should never have bothered with football and should have taken up acting from the very beginning. If you don't see this film I can't say that you have missed the experience of a lifetime but you sure have missed out on 90 minutes of trully excellent entertainment!! (8.5/10)",9,0,0,16 April 2001
Man of Steel," Something to pass the time, but definitely not the best Superman movie ever made (that'll be Superman II)
","I've given this movie a 5. I liked the acting by the more experienced members of the cast, Russel Crowe, Diane Lane and Kevin Costner. They added a lot to the whole and helped keep it just above par. I liked Henry Cavill as Superman. I hope they continue with him, but with a better script next time. The dialogues were mostly good, but there were quite a few plot holes. You know, the moments during a movie where your brain is telling you that what you are seeing is just not logical. Examples? The fact that Superman didn't help his dad in the tornado. He could just have covered him in the car. The fact that multiple people saw Superman unhurt by fire on the oil rig and then holding the whole thing so that it didn't fall on the helicopter. Same goes for him saving everyone on the bus when he was a kid. His identity surely should have been exposed far earlier. There are more. You'll find them.I've never read the comic by the way. All I know about Superman is from the movies of the 70's-80's and particularly Superman II. It might be that I was just a child back then, with a rampant imagination, but Superman II had feeling, it had character. Zod and his two henchmen (well one was a henchwoman) in Superman II were convincingly despicable. As a child I hated them for being such bullies and I felt utter joy when Superman tricked them in the end (and I particularly liked when he broke Zod's hand, and the pain on his face, before sending him to his icy prison). I understand Man of Steel is a reboot, but it also appears to be a remake of Superman II. Zod did not convince me in this one. The henchwoman was a bit better, but still, their motives were not convincing (and definitely not canon from what I gather). Also, despite not ever reading the comic, I know that only Kryptonite can affect Superman. A change in the atmosphere can't. I also didn't like the excessive and often pointless use of CGI. Again, Superman II, with 80s's technology did this better. Finally, Superman breaking Zod's neck? That's a no no. He doesn't do these things. At least the Superman I know.",5,1,4,19 October 2013
Transformers," The Rape of the Transformers
","In this movie you will witness the rape of the whole Transformers concept in the name of, amongst other things, US army propaganda. After about 45min into the movie I couldn't wait for it to end. I don't know where to start. It was obvious that Shia LeGoof could not believe his luck starring in this film. Megan Fox? Pretty? Who cares? Even if she had shown skin, she would still not be worth the 7euros. Classic nerdy boy-super hot chick plot line. We've seen it before (for the past 30years actually). The marines? They should have all perished in the first 15min of the film. And please stop adding lines about freedom in movies. Americans have not tasted freedom yet. Besides Tranformers, it's another concept they haven't fully grasped yet. Secretary of Defense? Sad and pathetic. I heard they are hoping for a trilogy. If the sequel is anything like this, it is going to be a flop. I sincerely hope they lose serious money in 2009. It's a shame IMDb does not allow half marks. This movie is a 4.5/10. However, if you take away the first 45min or so and the at times excellent visual effects, it would barely reach 2/10 in my books. Every Transformers fan should get their hands on this movie, so that they don't pay hard-earned money when the sequel comes out. You have been warned!",5,2,6,25 September 2007
The Shawshank Redemption," I'm gob-smacked!!!
","I had never heard of this movie.I missed it when it came out in theatres.But fortunately it was my destiny not to miss it.It is amazing!It has absolutely no 'leaks',no parts in the plotline where you say 'hey,something's wrong here'.Freeman and Robbins give an excellent performance. It is one of the very few Hollywood movies I've seen,which actually contains large quantities of drama and feeling.Don't miss this movie,cause if you do you've lost one of the best experiences of your life",10,0,0,15 December 2000
