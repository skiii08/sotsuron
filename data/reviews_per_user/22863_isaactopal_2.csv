Catch Me If You Can," Amazing movie!
","This is one is my best movie I have ever seen. It had everything - great actors, great music by John Williams, the amazing director Steven Spielberg. It wasn't boring for a second although being over 2 hours long. I simply didn't want it to end and this is the main reason I gave the movie a 10.I loved the main character Frank's attitude and his brilliant way of thinking. The fact that it's based on a true story makes it even better. I had to Google Frank Abagnale Jr. after watching this and the friendly face that smiled on the pictures wasn't really what I expected. Leo plays the roll very well. I'm also thinking that Leo and Tom Hanks must have had a lot of fun filming this.I have definitely watched Catch Me If You Can more than ten times and i can watch it over and over again! Loved it! <3",10,1,2,2 April 2019
The Godfather," For Me, This Is The Definitive Film
","This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in film making and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. If i can give it 11 stars out of 10, i will.",10,1,2,2 April 2019
