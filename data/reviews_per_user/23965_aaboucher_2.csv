Blade Runner 2049," No, no, no.
","I understand that there's a unique art behind this film but I watched the Book of Life in Spanish having never seen it before and speaking little of the language and understood it better. If you enjoy slow-paced action, an A-List actor who barely appears in the movie and a complete state of confusion, then this is the movie for you. If you're looking for an engaging storyline that your eyes can stay open for, trust me, even the Emoji Movie is a better choice. Such an utter disaster of a movie that I'd fallen asleep by the end of its ridiculous story. I didn't even understand what was going on until 3/4 of the movie was done.",1,8,17,7 January 2019
Bird Box," What a rollercoaster from start to finish.
","I have never seen a movie with a full set of A-List actors thrill me and excite me with such gripping drama. I was on the edge of my seat with tension at every moment and despite the fact the audience was made aware of what would happen for the most part, there was still a constant excitement. By far the best movie I've ever seen.",10,1,7,7 January 2019
