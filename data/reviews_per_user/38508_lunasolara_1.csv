Howl's Moving Castle," Another masterpiece from Miyazaki-sensei
","This a movie that anyone can enjoy, from your grandmother to grandkids, without being too fluffy. (There are plenty of explosions for those who need them. *laughs*) I saw this while in Japan on vacation and it was certainly worth the 1800 yen (about $18) I paid for the privilege. This is an adaption of the book by Diana Wynne Jones, so don't be surprised when you hear English names throughout. While I normally disapprove of overhauling a novel for the big screen, this is one occasion when it seriously needed it and it was masterfully done. Howl is a far more admirable character in the film than he was in the book and the movie moves along at a fair clip without ever getting bogged down. Sophie's many transformations from young to old to not so old to young and back again (many of them very short-lived) are wonderfully done and add a wonderful dimension to the story that I'm sure Ms. Jones would (and probably does) approve of. The book was perfect as a book, but the screenplay is perfect for the screen while retaining the essence of the book. I look forward to dragging my friends to the theater to see if the translators and English voice actors have done it justice.",10,3,5,2 June 2005
