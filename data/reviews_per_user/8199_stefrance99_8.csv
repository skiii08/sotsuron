Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Jewish humour, (Not for Rednecks, Christians and other bigots)
","For those who may not have known (or even guess, given the name) Cohen is of Jewish origins (although educated in a Christian school), like Seinfield and other Jewish comics he is the first to criticise his culture/heritage and make us laugh. Very often the jokes against the Jews are in fact aimed at the reaction of the protagonists of the scenes, best example is the 'Throw a Jew down the well' scene when he sings a country like song and that the audience repeat the lyrics, or again in the minivan with the graduated students. To understand some jokes you have to either know history or culture, the Jewish Satyre puppet laying an egg being crushed before hatching is a direct reference to the behaviour of some eastern countries citizen against the Jews in the Nazi/Stallinians years of the mid 20th century. I think Cohen had a lot of courage in some of his scenes and I would love to see a behind the scene extra to see how much of it genuine, the Khazak Anthem song, the well mannered people dinner party, the Jesus church, the abduction of Pamela Anderson... because if they are, then that Americans are not so 'trigger happy blood minded killers'.Why I gave only a 6 is that although it's a good laugh it doesn't teach us much more about America that we already know. Yes there are loads of Racists (WASP, Rednecks), yes they are a Theocrary instead of a Democracy, yes they are usually unaware of what happens outside their borders but we already know that, don't we? I have lived in America and I can tell you there are a big bunch of very decent and friendly people over there, it' true that the IQ level seems to drop as they gather in larger and larger groups but I think it would have been nice to include some gags with genuinely friendly Americans.This movie is sure to make some fuss, and on my shelves it goes next to Fast Food Nation, Farenheit 9/11, Bowling for Columbine and Supersize Me and the likes",6,5,9,30 August 2007
Zodiac," Just toooooooo long
","Well, I surely am not among the mass of admirers, close to 50000 IMDb fans voting between 7 and 10, wow, I have to start wondering whether I'm not wrong about that movie.Actually I do agree with most of the comment about the acting, it's perfect, all the guys are impersonating their characters to the perfection, as any movie director could just dream. So the acting is great, the filming is great, the story is good, all stories based on 'a true story' always has that extra scary edge to it.But I'm sorry to say, it's far toooooo long, some people speak about the suspense, I want to ask them where the hell is it? The first few murders are thrilling, the last 15 mins of the movie are thrilling, but the 'in between' is absolutely boring and not saved by the acting.We watched the movie with my wife not knowing anything about it, just picking it from the actors (that we like a lot) and the poster, well after the 1st hour I was starting to check my watch, 1h30 later we were starting to consider leaving the theatre but for not having checked the length of the movie, we stayed hoping for a swift deliverance, it only happened 45 mins later, after another 30 long minutes.So again, there is no denial about the quality of the story or the acting or even the outcome, but I will disagree with anyone speaking to me about suspense or even movie masterpiece. Watch it if you are insomniac it may help you to find sleep.",5,4,8,17 February 2008
Alien vs. Predator," Burn the Witch!!! Burn the Witch!!!!
","0 it only deserve a '0', how could it be possible that such an Icon movie was allowed to be slaughtered by one of the worst movie writer ever? Paul S.W Anderson has already done it's worst with 'Mortal Combat', 'DOA' and the 'Resident Evil', how could they let him direct, write and produce what should have been one of the most exciting encounter between two major figures of the SF cinema. Even the comics released with the background of AVP have a much better storyline than this S**T, he just took the end bit with the ritual scaring from the original comic. We already know that Predators have encountered Aliens in the past (Predator II: inside the predator's trophy collection you can see an Alien's skull). Using humans as a background is OK, but why on earth nowadays, why not use the 'Aliens' background of a terraformed human colony to re-enforce the AVP feeling. And using humans then why not at least use some tough Colonial marines, like in the video game? Don't we all miss Corporal Hicks or Private Hudson or even Vasquez and her heavy machine gun and bad mood? Of all the possible scenarios Anderson went on to writing one of the worst and cheesiest scenario possible. I'm sick of it because the disappointment is at the scale with the expectation I built from being a 1st minute fan of the Aliens and Predators movies, comics and games.... Mr James Cameron, please if you read this, can you make AVP2 so we can bury AVP or even better burn it.",1,0,3,8 September 2007
Ghost Rider," Could have been a way lot worse
","It's a comic book adaptation, and does exactly what it says on the tin... I was fearing a lot when I first saw the trailer, but the movie comes out quite well, the special effects are decent, Cage acts nicely and the follow up from the comic is respected and is the proof that it doesn't take a genius to make a decent adaptation. After so many slaughters of comics by Hollywood (Dare Devil, Elektra, F4, AVP, etc...) it's pleasant to see one that has not been butchered. Actually looking forward to see some sequel especially if made in the same manner and quality.However this is not a piece of art, but an entertaining pizza movie",5,0,1,13 February 2008
I Am Legend," Watch the trailer not the movie
","When some movie ends, you can't help but ask yourself: 'Why?', 'I am Legend' is such a movie. Why such a good start and such a cheap ending?Why such a good acting (Will Smith) on such a poor story line? Why such a minimalistic presentation of the victims of the KV Virus, leading to the incoherences or unfinished feelings?Why trying to build a religious and moral crap 15 minutes from the end? Why ending without answering some questions: the KV virus is apparently only for humans, dogs and rats?... Why some people are immune?... What is the liquid he pours in front of his door?... Why the trained and fit military background man such as Will Smith character fails where an underfed religious fanatic and 12 years old kid succeed?Why the hell does he start sleeping into his bath and ends up into his bed? Why with all the technology at his disposal doesn't Neville even have a pair of night goggle or light amplification ones to go into dark building rather than use a torch lamp that betray his position...?So regardless of how appealing the background is, or how good Will Smith struggle to survive and achieve something is, there are too many WHY for me to call it a good movieFrom the middle to the end of the movie, the degenerated human victims of the KV virus had an uncanny CGI facial look (eyes expression, bald head) and superhuman movement (jump, fighting abilities) resemblance to their older brothers of 'I Robot'.The special effect to turn NY into a desolated Island are great but the effects used onto the KV Victims is poorly convincing, which is a shame as recent movies have shown quite stunning looking undead/monsters...The inconsistencies are constant in the movie, especially after meeting the first KV Victims.What can be infected and what can't, deers, lions are at loose in Manhattan while from the first night we can hear hundreds of owls of mutants, how did they manage to survive that long? I can't see anything surviving a rat swarm if all the rats turned into the things in Neville's laboratory...The KV virus turns its victims into a hairless, super zombie, sensitive to UV, OK fair enough then how comes that theses zombies are able to make a trap and not able to to just move within the shadow of the buildings or even wear clothes to protect themselves. Why do they know where he gets his DVDs from and after 5 years not even know where he lives?The whole night/sun light which is appealing and creates a sort of pressure at the start of the movie turns crap after the mutants dogs' attack... If the dogs are just hurt by direct exposure of sun beam and stand in the shadow of the building why can't the other zombie mutants do the same? This part was probably the most disappointing one as it created a huge confusion.Neville goes around all NY apparently mapping a list of buildings completely empty, surely these buildings are in the dark, no? So why does he freaks out to enter the building where the deer and dog have entered and just enters a new habitation building so casually?Why not exploit the indication that the zombies have a new community with leadership and control over animals rather than as Neville says 'they have lost all humanity'?Why not exploit the fact that the subdued zombie used by Neville for his experiment was the 'mating' or 'female partner' of the tribe leading zombie? The two points above would have reinforced the reason for Neville to fight to find a cure...All through the movie we are fed with a couple cool ideas and it turns into an anticlimax, especially the last minutes at the safe heaven, with the cheap wall and door guarded by a couple guys with assault rifles and the sound of a church bell...........Will Smith plays very well but sadly it's not enough to turn it into a good movie and it's appalling to see how many people have so little reflexion... I may have been harsh with 3 but it surely doesn't deserve a 8Enjoy or not, as usual this will be your call but you have been warned",3,2,5,5 February 2008
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Not good, but not totally bad either
","Improved compared to the 1st one, which to be honest wasn't difficult at all. So rather than good points I would say less bad points. 1) If you don't know the comic you will enjoy it more, if you do, probably not 2) Acting was better and bit more credible 3) Special effects cool but not breathtaking, but the case is worth it 4) Interesting idea to represent Galactus more like a moving Black Cloud/Hole, making him even humongous size human as in the comic would have made it unrealisticNot good points 1) What the Hell with the Silver Surfer destroying (suposedly) Galactus 2) The surfer is too human 3) The battle against Dr Doom is yet again an anti-climaxAnd just for the note, as I'm really tired of 'Cliche' in movies why put a Chinese Music with a background and people dressed in Japanese Kimono. How can people be educated when you see this kind of sad cliché, kind of, they are all Yellow and that's the same. If bother to have people speak Japanese, dress in traditional Kimono and act like Japanese why the Hell put a Chinese music with that. After that people don't understand why kids have no general knowledge...",5,1,3,28 August 2007
Transformers," You have always been weak.....(at adapting Super Heros/Animation to the big Screen)
","Why 8 and such a title? Well because if you look for a cool action packed Blockburster, with amazing CGI, great soundtrack, wicked humour, a storyline written on the back of a Subway Ticket and good looking war-machines then this is your movieIf you like Transformers then this has nothing to do with it, the only respect (aside from reusing the same dubbing actor for Optimus Prime) is the colour scheme, Yellow for Bumblebee, Red/Blue for Optimus Prime, Greyish for Megathron and so on, aside from that I Challenge anyone to tell me what transformed robot is supposed to look like when in his vehicle shape. For me this is the biggest disappointment as rather than say that call them Transformers I would call them Mimickers or Dopplegangers...even some car advertisement have car/robot transformation more realistic.-----------------------------Spoiler bellow---------------------------- I know there is little room on the back of a Subway ticket, but once they have the 'Cube' and they know that upset and bloody minded Decepticons are chasing them, where should you go for safety and fighting your ground? In the middle of a City, but of course, where you can have maximum collateral damages doh!!!!! Sorry but even though the fight were awesome why the hell didn't they made the stand at the Dam? Just imagine, 5 Autobots VS 7 Decepticons on a narrow Dam fighting between life and death with a couple Decepticons trying to destroy the Dam to add some more casualties wouldn't it have been really cool?Go watch it as it's place is in a Theatre or at best a Home Cinema, but don't buy it",8,0,3,14 August 2007
30 Days of Night," It's a Bloody movie but also a Bloody movie
","This movie is hugely entertaining, great special effects, cool 'new' looking vampires, fantastically gory but the plot, well, that's the only thing absent in this movie... so 10 for the Vampires 0 for the plot = 5What was good? The location, it has been proved in movies like 'The Thing' or 'Shinning' that snowy landscape enhance the feeling of isolation. So the careful set-up, airport closing, 3/4 of the population leaving etc...plays beautifully to install the right mood.The Vampires themselves are quite cool, purists will complain about the teeth thing, and I can see their point, but all in all they look plain evil, not quite human, but not Nosferatu alike either. Quite liked the guttural language that sounds like an old middle eastern dialect. The strength and agility is there, the blood thirst is there, the contamination by blood/bite is there, so yes they are Vampire. Also to make them even less human (while human looking) they are just dressed in summer dress or suits and still look impervious to the bone-freezing cold.The gore, well I have to say that it's hard to make a movie that is gory but stays scary. The gore also gives that bestial aspect to the vampires that keeps the viewer indecisive on whether they are more human or more bestial. And probably the most convincing beheading I have ever seen on screen (not to count the one I do in my back garden)The special effects are very decent and not overdone, that contribute to the cool aspect of the vampires.What's not good? The Vampires start the movie as a cunning, well organised deadly killing machine and end up little less than a bunch of savage gathered together by a pack leader. I would like to understand why after methodically making sure that no communication means were left (mobile phone burnt, sledge dogs slaughtered, internet/radio/phone station destroyed and helicopter in pieces), that the power station is neutralised (within the first few hours of the first day) do they become so stupid (aside for justifying the title). They use baits to find out survivors, they obviously kept a few alive as snacks too, but why? Why after being obviously aware of the start of the 30 days of night does it take them 19 days and a few hours to raze the town to burning cinders? Why did they not, after the first 24hours searched systematically each house and then burn them to find hiding survivors?Granted they are Vampires, they don't feel bullets much (or so it seems), but they are not impossible to kill (shotgun to the head, beheading etc...) why is there is only one fire axe available in the movie, no chainsaw either...just one axe...lame...The time span, this is the worst let down of the movie because it kills the atmosphere built at the start of the movie, and barely explained how the survivors manage to sneak and get food, water and other 1st supplies. It's just jumps from day 1 to 7 to 27 and then last day it says how little ideas the writer had for the plot. The time span ads nothing to the plot, it doesn't really re-enforced the sense of survival because the gaps are too large, nor does it gives a feeling of hope as they close to the return of the sun.The snow, well it's beautiful but had the very bad habit of leaving tracks that could be used by the vampires to follow the survivors Where the Hell have the remaining vampire gone a few hours before sunset in a burning city? What could have been done to make the movie better? Drop the 30 days of night idea and replace it by a rare long sun eclipse or something like that, this would have probably saved the movie as the survival and struggle would have been for a few days and there would have been no need to explain the painful inactivity of the vampires.Not necessarily kill the entire city in the first few hours of the first day, this would also have given the survivors with more casualties for the the following days.Trying to kills the vampires traditional ways (holywater from the church, wooden stick in the heart...) only to find this doesn't workMay be put some more weapons at the disposal of the survivors, how about taking the UV bulbs and fixing them on lamp torch? That would have created some cool weapon for little cost.Find another non cheesy ending. So as you can see, it's a decent movie let down by the plot (as many are), watch it if you like vampires without being a purist, watch it, just make sure you don't spend too much money on it.",5,0,1,14 February 2008
