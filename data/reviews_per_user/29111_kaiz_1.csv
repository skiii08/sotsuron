Catch Me If You Can," not bad
","This is quite an entertaining and interesting movie and also not the typical movie you would expect from Steven Spielberg. It is also much better than SpielbergÂ´s couple of last movies. It has very nice and relaxing pace and gives you kind of a chill out feeling as you watch it. Sixties are portrayed very stylishly and the soundtrack is really good. Christopher Walken is great as usual. He defenitly gives the most memorable performance of this movie. Hanks is okay, nothing special. Di Caprio? Well, I think there are other actors who could have been better but he gets the job done. At least he is not annoying. Not a movie you would remember too much about after 6 months but it has some great jokes and an interesting story. Hollywood entertainment - nothing more, nothing less. 6/10",6,0,2,23 March 2003
