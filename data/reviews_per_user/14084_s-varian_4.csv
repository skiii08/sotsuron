Casablanca," best movies ever made
","Casablanca is an iconic movie that allows us a cultural freeze into the time period. Humphrey Bogart, and Ingrid Bergman are phenomenal actors and they give an explosive and life changing performance. There is an air tight plot with an extremely well written screen play. The pacing is awesome. The themes in Casablanca were life altering as well. The price of freedom is worth any sacrifice. There's a memorably music score, there are tons and tons of great quotes.The entire plot is action packed and it is satisfying story line that keeps the audience interested and on the edge of their seats. The ending is one of the most beautiful and satisfying endings of any movie, it's extremely beautiful and calming. Overall Casablanca is one of the best movies ever made.",Null,2,3,8 May 2012
The Graduate," Robert Redford as Benjamin Braddock? noooo
","The Graduate is such a crazy good movie. I love Dustin Hoffmans underdog, kind of loserish character. He asks for nothing, and gets more than what he bargains for. I had read somewhere that Mike Nichols had given Robert Redford a screen test for the part of Benjamin Braddock. I laughed, because there's no way RObert Redford could pull that kind of character off. Dustin Hoffman was phenomenal because he was so good at being nothing. He was too good at it. It made for such a dynamic screen sensation when he laid next to Mrs. Robinson and tried asking her questions about her interests. Heres a kid who doesn't like much stuff himself, but he wants to know all about someone else. It's such a great script and i could analyze everything that happens all day and write books on it. I also loved Simon and Garfunkel in this film. Some movies are just totally made by the sound track, and this one is one of them.",Null,0,0,13 May 2012
Singin' in the Rain," not a fan of musicals, but still phenomenal
","I'm a huge Gene Kelly fan and I've loved this movie since i was a kid. I'm not particularly fond of musicals at all, but the plot in this one far outshines the fact they sing. The classic story of an evil lady trying to sabotage an innocent girl is almost always an entertaining story. The whole script was just so well written from every stage of the movie, from the flashbacks in the beginning, to the end, and even some of the song lyrics, every things perfect. What i love most about this movie is the fact that it blends comedy so well with the fact that its also a musical. First and foremost, it's a love story with twists and turns and such, and secondly, they sing. I mean, i have to admit some songs were catchy and the choreography was phenomenal, i just find most musicals something hard to relate to.",Null,0,2,13 May 2012
Psycho," best horror movie of all time
","Psycho is by far one of my favorite horror movies. Hitchcock was a phenomenal director, and a phenomenal screenwriter as well. I've never seen a movie with a more perfect script than this. The story is told so well, that i've seen this probably ten times and have never gotten bored or annoyed by it. Anthony Perkins plays a phenomenally creepy mentally insane murderer, who in all truthfulness haunted my dreams for years. I know have a healthy respect for him but only because he plays his part so insanely well. Anthony Perkins is what makes Psycho, Psycho. The shot by shot remake of this film, while identical in every way was missing the most vital thing, Perkins. He can not be replaced, as no one can mimic the character he became to complete this film. The chemistry was seriously lacking in the remake because you copy Hitchcock, but you can't be him, you can't be his genius.",Null,0,0,13 May 2012
