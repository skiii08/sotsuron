The Ring," If I could give this less than '1' I would
","This movie was such a waste of my life it's unreal.  I spent the entire movie debugging the film.  It was not scary, it was not even remotely realistic and WAY over-rated.  Seriously, if I could give it anything less than a '1' it would be a negative 4.8 on the over-rated movie richter scale.",1,0,2,31 January 2004
Training Day," An amazing rush
","I was not expecting to like this movie.  I'm not for blow-it-up, shoot-em-up or blood-n-guts movies, so I anticipated being mildly amused at best. However, I could not pull myself away from the screen.  Unfortunately, I waited until the DVD came out to watch it and missed out on the big screen action.  The characterization and acting of both Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington were phenomonal.  Denzel is an extremely talented actor, but he blew me away in Training Day.  He WAS Alonzo Harris.  He drew me into this movie so deeply that my heart was racing and I was on the edge of the couch. Both these extraordinary actors are nominated for Academy Awards and they definately deserve them.  This movie was about truth and the search for 'justice' - street or otherwise.  I was astounded by the directing but more so by the script.  It is an amazing script.  I can't stop raving about this movie!  Training Day will now be added to my list of all-time favorite movies - I recommend this to everyone, especially on DVD for the deleted scenes and alternate ending.",10,7,18,22 March 2002
Shaun of the Dead," If I could give this a ZERO...
","This was easily one of the absolute worst movies I have ever seen. It was supposed to be funny - well it wasn't funny in the least. Actually, what I found hilarious was the fact that I lost 90-ish minutes of my life watching this movie. I have seen some BAD movies in my day, and most of the time I can find something to appreciate about them. Shaun of the Dead has NO redeeming value to it whatsoever. I had wanted to root for his character, until I realized that HE wrote the script. I heard a four-letter 'C' word ONE too many times to tolerate and found that British humor is incredibly offensive - if this is, in fact, 'British humor.' Think it's because I'm a girl? My fianc√©, who LOVES toilet humor and parodies, begged me to turn it off. He said it was worse than having his nose hairs ripped out with a tweezers then having lemon juice poured up his nose. That's pretty bad. It was simply the most over-rated pile of rubbish I have ever seen. I do not recommend it and I sincerely hope that the writer seriously considers a new career.",1,21,68,18 August 2005
The Others," This movie was good when it was called 'The Sixth Sense'
","SPOILERS I was so incredibly p***ed off when I saw the end of this movie and realized I had seen it two years ago in 'The Sixth Sense.'  The movie, up until the end, was good.  However, there's something about a rip off ending that really wrecks a movie for me.  True, this is a re-make from an older movie, but come on - wait ten years before releasing something identical to one of the biggest movies in history.  The only redeeming factor is that Nicole Kidman plays one screwed up mofo, once you realize what she did. All-in-all, I left the theatre wishing I had waited for video and saved 8 bucks, since I paid that the last time I saw it in 1999.",8,0,0,4 November 2001
War of the Worlds," Straight to the point 'review'
","I thoroughly enjoyed War of the Worlds, though I know the critics and IMDb junkies will have it torn apart by the end of opening weekend. Spielberg did amazing things with this flick and I was impressed. The casting was great - Dakota Fanning is the most unbelievable little girl. She is amazingly talented. When she screamed, I could feel her terror - when she cried, I just wanted to reach out to her on the screen. She is SO convincing and the movie would be lacking so much without her. Tom is great as Ray, but not because of the reason that I expected. It's because he's just a blue-collar guy trying to protect his kids. There is absolutely nothing extraordinary about his character and I think that's why it worked so well. I wanted to smack Tim Robbins so bad and I think that was the point - he was a great choice for the role. Morgan Freeman as narrator was a nice touch. Yes, there are plot holes (big ones) but the movie is quite entertaining. This was the first movie in a long time that I just sat back and let the special effects fly. I'm really not a big fan of Spielberg in general (ordinarily I just don't care) but the effects in this movie were awesome. The machines look strikingly similar to the old, old comic, so they're a bit cheesy but the stuff going on around them makes up for it ten-fold. There's a scene where Ray is looking for Rachel and comes up over this little hill and the landscape as far as you can see is red from the 'extermination' and it is eerily beautiful. It's the Spielberg touch. Go see it - it kicked 'arse!'",10,3,12,30 June 2005
