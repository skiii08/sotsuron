Source Code," Why do they do this?
","First of all: why do they, in movies, tend to use wrong terms or combinations of terms just to look cool? When they are sending Colter (Jake Gyllenhaal) into the Source Code they say: 'Charge the drivers.' What the hell does that mean? It just doesn't make any sense.There are so many loopholes in the technology that is supposedly behind this Source Code project. I understand that it is fiction for mere entertainment, but at least try to sell it as if it were possible or at least logical.And then there is the plot itself, which is so simple and shallow that I was never 'in touch' with the characters or why they were acting the way they were. It was easy to predict the questions that were raised, and you can see the last 15 minutes coming from a mile off.The idea was nice, although it consists mostly of pieces put together from other movies, but the execution was just plain off.",5,0,1,29 April 2011
The Bourne Ultimatum," Hopefully this really is the end...
","I have to confess first that I didn't see any of the first two Bourne movies, but after reading some rave reviews I gave this one a chance.Didn't know much details but I knew the main storyline. I was expecting a movie with clever twists and turns mixed with some intense action. Well, there was action alright. But only half of it was decent. Mostly the action involved a shaky camera and some loud noises, cars crashing. Nothing really spectacular.As far as plot twists go, this was as straightforward as can be. Even without knowing much about it I could almost guess everything bound to happen.The acting was fair, action decent and story weak. I am glad the series is ending here... or is it? The ending sure leaves an opportunity to come back to the Bourne franchise when they need money.",6,2,4,21 September 2007
