Your Name.," Missing Anime Days
","'Treasure the experience. Dreams fade away after you wake up.'Wow, that was actually really good. Even when watching it at 1am in the morning at my Japanese friend's place, it was really exceptional. I hadn't watched anime in a long while, so when she suggested turning this movie on (which I had heard of in advertisements before this cuz of it's endless popularity), I happily accepted, despite the early hours of the morning. When I watched it, I realised that despite having loved anime in the past, I'd never actually watched an anime movie before. But ultimately, it really wasn't too different in style from TV shows. They managed to capture all the traditional anime elements (school life, dates, part-time jobs, festivals, etc.), yet put an original spin on all of it. And, like most anime, it has a completely weird premise and dark plot twists. Funny thing with anime is that I can never really tell how it'll end, cuz so many anime in the past have had the craziest kind of endings. I can never really be sure. I'll always be in doubt until the very last scene.The Japanese-style scenery and animation was spot-on. The soundtrack was really good (as is always with anime). Look, pretty much, this movie's great all round - just give it a watch.Actually, I almost forgot to mention that it's also good on the emotional side of things, so much so that I glimpsed tears in my friend's eyes towards the ending...Pretty much infinite praise for this anime. It really was so good. Lol also, just sort of realised that I miss my anime-watching days so badly.",9,4,6,24 June 2017
It," Not too scary, but not too bad
","Not as good as the reviews say, but still okay. Never seen the original, but gave this a watch cuz everyone was saying how scary it was. It's really not actually scary though. In fact, most of the time there was a sense of comfort cuz Pennywise didn't really harm any of the protagonists in the entire movie, and I got the idea that he wasn't going to about halfway through. There was probably one scare that made me sort've jump, but that was it. The rest of the movie wasn't that tense. The actor of Georgie was annoying, but that was the only actor I thought was subpar.",7,1,2,7 October 2017
Fight Club," Weird, WEIRD ending
","I was really looking forward to this movie, hearing it was a cult classic, but it really didn't live up to expectations. Ultimately, this movie is about a bunch of guys with first world problems and to escape these 'problems' (by the way, the protagonist's problems include living a dull life with a stable, reasonably well-paid job that he hates. A lot of people would die to have the life he's living) they beat each other up in a so-called 'fight club' to be something they're not in their normal life. They also decide to take it out on other people and become a crime gang.The whole movie, you're waiting for something exciting to happen, and instead, nothing happens. Then, you come to the incredibly confusing/weird ending where we watch the protagonist run around the city in his underwear (yes, you read it right). I don't really understand how this is 'cult', but I wouldn't recommend watching this. It's boring and very long and there's no great conclusion to look forward to. Special mention to that I despised the main character. His actor was really annoying. Don't know who that was, but thankfully I don't think I've seen him in another movie. And no wonder why. His facial expressions were the most annoying parts to this movie. Even on the front cover!",6,1,3,18 November 2016
Passengers," Actually pretty good
","I was actually enticed to watch this movie after listening to its Chinese promotional song ('Light Years Away' by G.E.M.). The Chinese promotional trailer/song was better than the movie (which they usually are), but the movie was still quite good. Although having a dark, depressing concept, the movie itself was fairly light and almost feel good. There was a part of me that wanted it to be darker and to further explore the morality of Jim's actions, but I'm sort've glad they didn't make it feel lonely and lost. I'm surprised the critic reviews have been as bad as they are, considering this really wasn't a bad movie. Sure, it wasn't a masterpiece in terms of themes, feel and storyline, but it was engaging enough and quite unique. The visuals were excellent and so was the bartender android. A good romantic movie to watch.",8,3,4,7 October 2017
Troy," Okay, I guess
","'Imagine a king who fights his own battles. Wouldn't that be a sight?'Not exactly great tbh. A historical war movie similar to 'Defiance' and 'The Last Samurai', but not as good as either. It didn't feel like there was any relationship between the audience and the characters, so it lacked the emotion other war movies have. The one-on-one fight scenes were impressive, despite the lack of good music. As far as themes are concerned, the movie was about mortality and the physical power of a human. It IS original to have a physically- perfect character like Achilles in the 'War' genre, but it's not enough to save the film from averageness. Watch half an hour of this too see if you like it. If not, don't keep going because it's like that the whole film and it's 3 hours long (could've been cut to be much shorter as well).",6,0,0,31 October 2016
The Shining," Doesn't Live Up To Fame
","Despite being known as one of the best horror movies out there, and one that builds tension rather than rely on 'cheap' jumpscares, I felt this movie to be relatively dull. With a run time of 2h 40m, there may have been 3 good scenes lasting maybe 3 mins each. The remaining 2h 31m was filled with boring, stretched out hallucinations, radio calls, conversations that don't relate to a plot, and Jack Nicholson losing his temper. I know some people seem to think that this builds tension, or even fear, but I neither felt engaged or scared. Just bored. Though I liked the music, it was carelessly thrown about and never fit the scenes that it was played over. It felt like the work of a 9 year old learning to use iMovies. Not sure if this was intentional or not, but it just felt wrong. Though I disliked most of this movie, there were some great ideas and scenes in it (e.g. the kid riding the toy vehicle through the corridors), but it wasn't until the very ending scenes when things actually got interesting and tense. The ending scenes could have been better had the tension been built up better beforehand, but sadly, it wasn't to be. And when the ending scenes, which were pretty typical and clich√©d, were the best aspect, it's not looking good after trudging through 2h of gunk. To describe this movie in one word: boring. Very disappointed, as I was genuinely eager to watch this after all the hype and good reviews, but it doesn't live up to expectations and wouldn't even crack my list of Top 25 Horror Movies. Not sure if mediocreness is a running theme in Stephen King movies, but the two I've watched ('The Mist' and 'The Shining') haven't really astonished me.",5,9,21,28 October 2016
Saw III," Annoying protagonist
","The movie wasn't too bad. Not as good as the first two, but still alright. In fact, the worst parts of the movie were the characters. Particularly, Amanda and the guy who goes through all the traps (not sure what his name is). Amanda, or Jigsaw's accomplice, was really quite pathetic and destroyed the entire purpose of the 'Saw' franchise with unwinnable 'games'. She was annoying and confusing and really didn't live up to Jigsaw's far superior actor. However, she only contributed partly to the problem with this movie.The protagonist guy was incredibly frustrating to watch. I know he was in mourning and everything, but seriously!!! He could literally save every person from the traps, but didn't. What made him more annoying was that with every person he could save, he was indecisive until the last moment, when he decided to save them, and he's too late. Frustrating. Just because he can't make an obvious decision, people suffer brutal deaths.Other problems I'd like to note: the surgery scene was far too gratuitous. Should've been removed. Also, I didn't like how Jigsaw got angry. He's always incredibly calm and under control. Why did the writers make him crack? Overall, if you enjoyed the first two movies, you should give this a watch, but don't expect much.",6,0,0,21 November 2016
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Really not great.
","This once again shows that the critics have lost the plot, and that they'll throw out high ratings to anything Disney dumps out on our screens. The plot was filled with problems and the movie prefers to stand alone rather than develop the series as a whole. The plot is somewhat incoherent. Rey, for example, is a character with exceptional strength with the Force, but she's pretty much entirely untrained. How does she have the ability to control the Force like a Jedi Knight who must study for years to attain similar power? How did she defeat Kylo in 7? There's not really any explanation. Raw power doesn't mean that she can focus it to achieve the things she does. This was one of many problems I had. Mark Hamill was right about Luke's characterisation. His whole character doesn't really make much sense. This was surely a result of the movie-makers intentionally avoiding fan expectations to try and make the story unexpected. They'd rather have an unguessable plot than a good one.We didn't get to see any epic lightsabre duels, no real training from Luke Skywalker, and no explanations for what happened in 7. Snoke was cool, yet unexplained. I'm hoping that he turns out to be Darth Plagueis (the Sith who could supposedly cheat death) and returns in the next movie. This would be a way to recover from the badness in this movie, cuz they'd have a chance to give the character a background and to make the plot more coherent. Sadly, I doubt they will, cuz all good ideas fans have had have been rejected on the basis of wanting to create an unexpected plot. Look, I agree that a movie/show should not be manipulated by the fans (like how the most recent season of Game of Thrones just gave the fans what they wanted), but going exactly against what the fans want is still a result of the fans.Honestly, I prefer some of the prequels to this. 3 is definitely better. The prequels at least tried something new, and had epic lightsabre fights which are now absent in the sequel series. The whole Jedi lore that was developed in the prequels is almost completely dumped in this. 7 and 8 attempt to imitate the original, but it should've been an equal balance between the styles of the prequel and original, or just a completely unique style. I wasn't a fan of 7, but I thought this could at least pick up the pieces of that. I was wrong.",5,1,1,27 January 2018
Ip Man," Favourite martial arts movie
","High-budget and high-quality. Ip Man is really a unique kung fu movie with excellent sequels. The fight scenes were incredible and built onto the story nicely. Southern kung fu styles like Wing Chun (less acrobatic/less kicking and more short-range than Northern Shaolin styles) are rarely shown in movies, so it was great to see a different type of kung fu on-screen. Donnie Yen is a top actor/martial artist and perfect as Ip Man. It was fast paced and somewhat set out in story arcs (the sequels are entirely laid out in story arcs, with one overarching arc). Soundtrack was also good. Can't really fault the movie, so 10 stars. Highly recommend.",10,0,0,21 October 2017
Saw," Well-Deserved Fame
","'Saw' is perhaps one of the most well known horror movies, and it certainly deserves to be so. Every aspect of this movie was so well done, there wasn't a moment I felt disengaged. The villain was excellent, as were the creepy dummies and masks he left in his tracks. Those who don't enjoy horror movies also enjoy 'Saw' for it's uniqueness, elaborate storyline and lack of jump scares. The completely unexpected ending crowned the movie. After finishing watching, I just wanted to watch the sequel and the following movies in the series. Considering this comes from the guy who did the 'Conjuring 2', can you really expect anything but a masterpiece?",9,1,5,28 October 2016
The Last Samurai," Beauty beyond words
","'The perfect blossom is a rare thing. You can spend your life looking for one, and it would not be a wasted life.'Honestly, this is my favourite movie. Funny, because 'War' is one of my least favourite genres. But this movie is what I think is perfection. I admire Japanese culture, which probably helped, but this just had something special about it. And I can't finish watching it without tears welling up in my eyes (I think this is the only movie I've ever cried whilst watching). It's sad, it's heartbreaking, and it's very much how the world has been. There are many things that can be learnt from this movie. Ultimately, the movie comes down to people defending something they love and hold dearly, and dying for that and a precious and forgotten code of values - Bushido. It's amazing how the movie takes you down the exact path of Algren (Tom Cruise) - at first you view the Samurai as evil and you're sure you can't forgive them for what they did in that first battle scene, but as you see more and learn more, you begin to love the very thing you thought you'd always hate. Despite other movies being similar (namely 'Defiance'), they just don't hold the same beauty and intricacies of 'The Last Samurai'.If you're looking for something to make you cry, try this. Even if you aren't, watch it anyway. Wouldn't recommend anything more highly.",10,6,13,29 October 2016
In Time," Refreshing
","Ah, 'In Time' is always a delight to watch. It's strong on every level - plot, themes, entertainment, music, acting (with the exception of Timberlake). It's premise is original and interesting. From start to end, it's meaningful - every line of dialogue has a place and there's no time-filler. I am astounded the movie didn't receive critical acclaim. I understand there are plot problems, but it's not enough to compromise the rest of the movie. If you're over mindless action movies that, I highly recommend watching this - the whole way, it's intelligent, engaging and original. Characteristics increasingly hard to find in modern movies.",9,0,0,29 October 2016
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Not good. Really not good.
","This was really actually bad. So bad, I'm not even going to go into it deeply. I'll just list my least favourite aspects: Tauriel, Legolas, the fight scenes, Thorin, the clich√©s, the trailer, the war, the ridiculously impossible stunts done by the elves, the whole movie to be honest. So, let me get this right, Legolas struggled to kill 50 Urukai in LoTR, but took out at least 500 orcs on screen in this movie??? What happened between the Hobbit and LoTR? Did he just get old and lost his ability to take out 500 victims in one fight? That can't be it, because let's assume he's better than average in fighting for an elf, wouldn't like 10 average elves be able to take out an entire army on their own? Just imagine what that army at Helm's Deep could've done. They would've obliterated the Urukai long before the Rohirim arrive. Sorry guys, but this was a poorly-conceived movie even if you like epic fight sequences. Boooooring.",2,3,4,18 November 2016
The Cabin in the Woods," Don't Like It? Watch More Horror
","When I first watched this movie, I didn't really understand it, and treated it like just another horror movie. I may have given it a 5/10. However, I began taking to horror and watched a truckload of all the classic and modern movies before watching this again. The movie was completely different. I understood the subtle jokes and spoofs of horror movie clich√©s, and the references and allusions encompassed throughout this movie. The best part about this movie is that it's correct in how it stereotypes horror movies and you can see that when watching other horrors. The more horror movies you've watched, the cleverer and more intricate this movie seems, and more humorous.DO NOT WATCH IF YOU ARE EXPECTING AN AVERAGE HORROR MOVIE. UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A SPOOF.",8,1,6,28 October 2016
