The Ring," Let's cut the pretense. This movie was ultimately crap.
","While the more arrogant people in the room like to say that those who point out the gaping plot and story holes in this 'film' just don't get it, this flick is merely a bone thrown to the jack-asses who have been jonesing for that grainy, Zapruder-like offering to salivate over since the first Blair Witch.When the audience is left having to figure out HUGE gaps in the movie, it's not because the film is trying to be a think-piece. It's because it's a piece of crap. Leave big enough holes and everyone can feel smart by making up the explanations. The talk of the sequal only feeds the people who are starting to realize you can't really defend this movie. 'Well, we only know part of the story now. You'll know it all after the second movie.' Sorry. That's a little flat for me, and only reinforces that this movie was poorly made.To be honest, though, I didn't have that bad of a time watching. You certainly feel cheated when it (finally) ends, but until then you don't know how many loose ends will be left unexplained.Like with Blair Witch, though, it really doesn't pass the 'waaaaaait a minute' test just after you walk out of the theater and start thinking about what you just saw.Finally, I really don't give a crap how good or bad the foreign versions of this film were. I don't watch Japanese films. I'm not about to start watching Japanese films. I'm out of college, and no longer have to pretend to enjoy foreign or 'indie' films of ANY kind, so I rarely do, save for Life is Beautiful, which kicked ass.In a nutshell, the ride isn't bad, but when it's over you'll be left to guess a great deal of the story, and I don't consider that intellectual entertainment. I call it poor film-making. .",7,0,1,18 January 2003
Finding Nemo," Visually appealing, but too long for the story
","The people who spent years of their lives putting Finding Nemo together did an absolutely wonderful job at their keyboards, and during their on-site investigation of what the ocean looks like.Also, I found the voice actors did a commendable job, although I'm never sure how much is the actors, and how much is the animators synching and designing the characters who go with those voices.I did, however, find that this story was dragged out WAY too long for what it was. I imagine that Disney requires most of their animated features to involve everyone looking for a single character, or a character finding him/herself, but there really wasn't much going on in this film that would have been lost had it been condensed into an hour, or even 45 minutes. I may have been drawn in at some point, but had to sit there too long to stay involved.I think that children will find the characters fun and cute enough to thoroughly enjoy the film, however, although at this point I'm probably the only person who hadn't seen this picture. Now if I would just rent Titanic ...Take care.",5,1,3,10 December 2004
Pan's Labyrinth," Good, but not what you probably think it is
","My impression has been that this film is being marketed as some girl's fanciful creation of a fantasy world into which she retreats during a time of upheaval. Technically, that's probably true. But not the way Americans might expect it to be.If you expect to be drawn into Willie Wonka's chocolate factory for 90 minutes, you will be very disappointed. I would hazard that perhaps only about 30 minutes is spent in any sort of alternate reality. And that reality, while generally visually appealing, is actually much darker than Wonka's, for the most part.Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed this film considerably. But it's not 'Chronicles of Narnia.' There are rather graphic acts of violence, and the escape the girl finds in her alternate reality isn't exactly as rosy as you might expect. Every time you think maybe you should turn away from the screen in anticipation of what is about to happen, turn away, because that's exactly what is about to happen.The positive notes are not as readily digestible as they generally are in American movies. You have to be willing to accept that you have to work a little to find them.Finally, I would recommend this movie, but don't go if you're expecting something light or fanciful.Take care.",7,3,6,7 February 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Incredibly unremarkable
","I've seen the overwhelming number of glowing reviews of this film, and what they tell me is that people who are fans of musicals, Johnny Depp or Tim Burton will gush about ANY of their efforts that actually make it to the big screen. The songs were okay, but this movie suffers from the fatal flaw commonly found in movie musicals, in that the songs are just padding for a story that would otherwise take about 12 minutes to tell. Come to think of it, that is a flaw shared almost universally by films directed by Tim Burton, who has been exposed since his early breakthrough efforts as a director who is clearly more comfortable with style than any sort of story structure. A couple of actors were brought in for a bit more singing talent, but none of the songs really required much in the way of pipes. Burton is well-suited in his typical role as a decent director (as long as the film in shot in blue-and-white) who makes bad movies. Depp again sacrifices doing watchable fare in favor of being what he apparently considers an 'artist,' and Bonham-Carter does the yawn-through she usually does in roles donated to her by whoever her latest fling is. And as is also typical, a cast filled with actors many of us really like gives us a pedestrian effort, apparently believing that our affection for them is enough to keep us blindly attending sub-par fare. There's really just nothing to recommend about this flick, and if it's at the top of your list of movies to see, you'd really be best-served going with your No. 2.",1,29,63,23 December 2007
The Polar Express," Doesn't quite get the job done
","I didn't really know what to expect when I went to 'Polar Express.' All I knew of it was what I saw in the trailer. While watching it, I struggled with the urge to ask the people I went with, 'What, exactly, is the point of this film?' I struggled, because the point is obvious. It's your basic 'faith-in-Santa' story, which is fine. What I later realized was that this was quite a large effort to put forth such a small idea. I would liken it to building a skyscraper to house a newspaper stand. A lot of expense and effort went into the film, but it really didn't make it any better than it would have been had there just been a small cast of actors doing the same story. The only exceptions to me are the roller-coaster effects of animation when the train is traveling, which is quite nice, but not so over-the-top that it will make your stomach drop. I thought that was well done.But even the animation was wanting. Having watched 'The Incredibles' the night before, I think I prefer my animated characters to act animated - not pretend to move as humans. I honestly found the animation a little creepy because things just weren't right. It got downright sloppy when it came to the boy they picked up on the wrong side of the tracks. When he began chasing the train, and was brought on board, the lengths and movement of his arms was very odd.Ultimately, I didn't really find the movie or its characters very endearing, or anything close to resembling an instant holiday classic. It was a small story that had a lot of generally superfluous action and other crap tacked on to make it last 90 minutes. It seemed much longer.",5,2,4,11 November 2004
American Hustle," A SHORT review of the film (for a change)
","The performances in 'American Hustle' were fine. It was competently directed and didn't beat us over the head by constantly screaming 'it's the 70s!' But it didn't really serve the movie to stretch what should have been 30 minutes into 90. We don't need to worry about learning about the characters because their voice-overs give us that info.After the first 1:30, it does pick up a bit, but other than not knowing the exact details of how things are going to unfold, we're TOLD that things have been set into motion. There are no surprises in how these play out, and at the end you're just thinking, 'meh.'Take care.",5,1,1,22 March 2014
The Bourne Ultimatum," If this is the last film, I won't shed a tear
","I went to this film with the hope that the weaknesses in the previous films would be improved upon and that this would be a solid flick. Of course, I ALSO went to the second one hoping for the same thing. In both cases, I was disappointed.I thought the first movie in this trilogy had a good thread throughout, but was a little inconsistent and rough. But, with the promise of at least one sequel, I figured that the people who made the first film would see the flaws, strengthen them, and produce a really good second installment.They didn't. Nor did they do so for the third movie. Honestly, these movies are pretty much interchangeable. Scant minutes of dialogue between chase scenes, and not much quality to anything non-action-related.If you just want action with nothing special in the area of plot, this is your film. If you want a true suspense and thrill, you can easily do better.",6,0,3,10 September 2007
The Aviator," A very nice experience
","I tentatively went to see 'The Aviator.' I'm not really a Leonardo Di Caprio fan, not a big fan of 3-hour movies. I'm very glad I made the effort, and not because I turned around right after and sneaked into 'Meet the Fockers.' The film was shot very nice, although some suspension of belief was necessary for some shots that were very obviously 'fake-looking.' Generally, it was nothing fancy, and only a few things (like flashbulbs popping) were overdone a bit.The performances were very enjoyable, even to the point where Kate Blanchett was every bit as annoying as Katherine Hepburn as Katherine Hepburn seemed to be in real life. Possibly a bit of overacting there. Di Caprio did an outstanding job as a younger Howard Hughes, and the scene amid the Senate testimony does not disappoint.The story is an interesting one, and like Hughes or not, it makes me long for days when there were truly 'heroic' men of vision like Hughes or Chuck Yeager who always sought the next dragon to slay.You are, however, very aware of how long the movie is. It doesn't really click along. But that time is filled with entertaining material and it's difficult to really point to any one thing and say 'that should have been cut' to shorten the flick.I'll be buying this one the night the DVD comes out.",8,0,3,12 January 2005
Meet the Fockers," Basically the first movie warmed over
","I wasn't a big fan of 'Meet the Parents,' because it's basically Ben Stiller going through one agonizing situation after another, then at the end everyone understands everyone, blah blah.You're pretty much getting the same thing with 'Meet the Fockers.' All the performances were entertaining, and everyone played their roles very well. Streisand and Hoffman were given large characters to play, but didn't chew up the scenery, and that's better than I'd expected.Still, you've seen this movie before, but there are plenty of laughs if you enjoyed the first one, and I would recommend it for those people.The only other real negative I would toss in is that the use of Yiddish/Hebrew was superfluous. Rather than it just popping up as the result of normal situations, it was painfully overused in the context it was presented in.",6,0,1,12 January 2005
The Incredibles," Slow to start, but picked up nicely *pseudo-spoilers*
","I found that 'The Incredibles' was very nicely animated, and I enjoyed this much more than 'Polar Express,' in which I found the animated characters to move a little creepy. It was nice that there were good family lessons taught in the film, that the children behaved generally as 'normal' children would, and that there were positive female role models. I did think that the violence was a bit much, as well as the attempted suicide.Just to be clear, by 'suicide,' I don't mean that someone killed him or herself. But an attempt led to a rescue early in the film, when I thought there could have been quite a few other ways to set up a situation for a similar rescue other than a person intentionally trying to end his/her life via quick descent.As far as the violence, I just think it sometimes departed a bit much from typical cartoon violence when 'real' weapons were shot (as opposed to cartoonish, laser-type weapons) from time to time. There wasn't too much of that, though.I just thought I'd throw those in for the adults who are concerned about bringing children.I did find that the film sort of dragged for about the first half, until the entire family finally became involved in the adventure, and after that it was a very nice ride to be on. It was also nice that the heroes had to use quick thinking, and rely more on the females than most movies tend to, rather than always brute force to overcome obstacles. Even the brawn had to have some thought and strategy behind it. Ultimately, I'd recommend 'The Incredibles' for a full-price ticket, as opposed to those I'd only see for matinée prices, or wait for DVD.",8,1,2,11 November 2004
The Mist," Nothing to offer but a few effects
","I'm only commenting on 'The Mist' to spare some of you from wasting what these days is a good amount of money on a movie that is complete garbage. Sure, there were some nice effects regarding the 'monsters' and a little gore, but effects are pretty much the only thing this flick has to offer.As per the trailer, you all know that a bunch of people are trapped by the mysterious mist and what lives inside of it. In other words, your standard zombie movie scenario. NOW, imagine that typical zombie scenario where probably 60 percent of the time they spend trapped (and this is NOT an exaggeration) is filled with religious diatribes by Marcia Gay Harden's zealot character. After the first couple of outbursts, WE GOT IT! But no, the audience is treated to another, and another, and another, between every bit of action and alternate dialog. Do you really want to spend what is supposed to be a 90-minute escape listening to someone talking damnation for about 45 of those minutes? This movie provides no escape at all. It is a failed attempt at social commentary, wrapped up in the horror genre and is just not worth it, regardless of whether or not you find the ending satisfying.Please do not spend a penny on this. Forty minutes after the last preview ends, you'll be wishing the exit is handy.",1,5,16,3 December 2007
Saw," A lukewarm execution
","Having see 'The Grudge' a couple of days before, I welcomed the opportunity to watch 'Saw,' as a more psychological, rather than supernatural, thriller.Although I did not think the film was great, I liked the main idea, and didn't find most of the twists and turns to be predictable to the extent that I groaned when they'd occur. At the least, I wasn't spending my viewing time thinking about what would 'obviously' happen next, because there were definitely some surprises in there. But while the idea of two men waking up trapped in a dingy bathroom while a puppetmaster pulls their strings was a good one, the performances were generally not that good. They were passable, but the dialogue is very poor, and no one was going to parlay that crappy script into an Oscar nomination.The psychological thriller styles itself after 'Se7en' and 'The Cube' but the execution pales by comparison. (although the dialogue in 'The Cube' wasn't exactly fresh). I thought it was probably worth full price admission for the story, but the dialogue will likely keep you from truly being drawn completely into the film.",7,0,0,31 October 2004
National Treasure," A nice little ride
","'National Treasure' was a very nice time, and I recommend it to anyone wondering if it's worth the money. It's not really a roller-coaster ride, nor is it a psychological or suspenseful thriller. Instead, I think it is a nice combination of ingredients.There is enough action in the form of chase scenes and some occasional gunfire to satisfy the action-obsessed, but also presents enough of a puzzle to keep others interested, and vice versa. There is a the usual blooming relationship thing going on, as one would expect, but it never gets in the way of the movie's thread.I know that some of the conspiracy-minded will think that the treatment to subjects like the Freemasons and Knights Templar is superficial and simplistic, but who really cares, other than the nutbars who set their clocks by 'The Da Vinci Code'? It never attempts to spin an incredibly tangled web and claim it is actual fact. It touches on some historical truths and weaves them into the story without taking them or anything else too seriously.I would also say this is the perfect example of a movie where suspension of disbelief is required. Obviously, it is a little difficult to believe that, assuming you could steal the Declaration of Independence, that you could store and treat it in the manner they did and expect it to stay in one piece. Again, who cares? That doesn't really have anything to do with the story.There is also enough comedy an light-hearted moments typical of Nicolas Cage action films, but I believe they are a bit better in this film.In summary, I think that while this isn't exactly the greatest action film ever made, it's a nice combination of action, adventure, puzzle and comedy that will satisfy most people who watch it, and it's definitely a good time.",7,0,0,22 November 2004
30 Days of Night," The idiot's vampire film. Please avoid it.
","I'll try to be as vague as I can, but I felt it was necessary to write that this may contain spoilers of one kind or another. But if you do not want to read further, my point is basically that this is a film in which almost nothing stands up to the least bit of logical thought, even with the suspension of disbelief.Like many of you, I was lured to watch this film with the hope that it would be as entertaining as other films based on graphics novels like 'Sin City' and '300.' It seemed like a sure thing, giving the shaky-camera treatment to a twist on the vampire story. But something went horribly wrong along the way.We begin with the town of Barrow, Alaska, closing down for a 30-day period in which there is no sun. Skip forward a bit, and we've got a town under siege by perhaps the most pathetic group of vampires since those in the original 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer.' Don't get me wrong, they rate fairly high when it comes to freaky appearance. But we've got a town that, because of an exodus during the season, is down to 152 people. From here, we basically go to the same premise as every zombie movie ever made: A small group of survivors has to avoid capture, death, or a fate worse than both. The clock is ticking at 30 days because the sun will rise again after that stretch.NOW, there seem to be a few dozen vampires. And they know they have 30 days to feast. So they proceed to pretty much exhaust the entire food supply on the first day, then have a HECK of a time finding the survivors over the next month in a town of about 40 buildings. This attempt is made even more difficult by the fact that, with their superior physical abilities and numbers, the vampires still choose to hide and lurk about, rather than systematically checking every building in town in groups.There is some dialog on the part of the vampires, but it's generally nonsensical and doesn't really tell you anything. I'm not even sure more than one vampire ever speaks. In fact, you don't learn anything about the vampires, other than they don't manage to clean themselves up during the entire 30-day period. And as much as they enjoy the killing, once they seem to be seriously low on food (lets say, the last 29 days), there really is never any indication that they or the people trying to elude them are ever actually hungry. This being the case, you're kind of left wondering why they are attacking the town to begin with.Ultimately, this basically is like 'The Blair Witch Project' in one important way: Once you begin to think about it in the least, it suddenly becomes incredibly stupid. And style doesn't compensate the viewer for the lack of substance. Avoid this flick at all costs.",2,5,14,20 October 2007
Casino Royale," Room to improve, time to be patient
","As the trailers indicate, 'Casino Royale' is sort of a prequel to the other films, but takes place in today's world. Fair enough. There are so many incongruities and continuity errors among the films that if you try to take any sort of linear approach to the movies as an ongoing story you'll drive yourself quite mad. The fans just ignore them. After all, if Felix Lighter can toggle back and forth between races from movie to movie, we can accept that this is sort of a fresh start with a familiar character without it necessarily being negative for the franchise.This is the approach I took to the film. The character is familiar, but not exactly what we're used to. He is closer to the Connery portrayal as a 'blunt instrument' for MI-6, but he is more raw and I think the key here is that many things that are likely being seen as negatives by many can be explained by the fact that the movie IS a sort of prequel. He doesn't speak that much. He doesn't have the groan-inducing, corny quips. He doesn't spend time lunching with his target. Those are more the marks of a polished James Bond who, as of this movie, doesn't exist yet. He gets his 00 status at the very beginning of the film. I choose to see the character differences as a Bond at the early stage of his evolution, rather than decrying them as flaws in the performance.That being said, there are still things in this film that are departures from the norm. Bond seems to rely more on the team concept at MI-6, rather than doing all the legwork until an entire Naval fleet makes its timely appearance at the end to clean things up. This sort of runs counter to him being the headstrong, ego-driven character. There were almost no gadgets to speak of, so no obligatory 'now listen up, 007' gadget-introduction scene. It was a little more action hero, and less smooth operator, and while I think it's fine that the character is not as polished (see above), it seemed like they had similar scenes that you get from previous films, but it didn't seem like there was a great deal of thought put into how to put those scenes together, or how to transition from one to another, especially the closer to the end of the film you get. It made things seem choppy or tacked-on at times.I think that in the next few films the Bond character will evolve more into what Connery gave us, but I would probably find a new director who understands the franchise a bit more. Pretty much any director could have pulled off what was shot in this film.Overall, I encourage viewers to take this film on its own merits, rather than comparing it too much with earlier incarnations. That being said, it's better than Timothy Daulton, but will never be better than Connery. I think there is a good chance of being better than Moore, though, and maybe even the last Brosnan one. At the very least, if you are a Bond fan, you will be entertained, and any 2+ hour movie gives you more for your money.",6,1,1,25 November 2006
Shark Tale," Decent production, but hard to identify with
","First, I can see why people may feel the need to criticize the story of this movie. After all, it's been done a few thousand times. Keeping in mind that a young child has probably only seen the story played out a few dozen times, though, I can let that slide.What I would inform parents about, however, is that this roughly seems to be a hip-hop culture flick as much as a children's flick. The musical turns are to that culture, as are most pop culture references. A number of children in the theatre when I attended did not seem interested in the characters. My guess is that they couldn't identify with the characters, or understand some of their behaviours, because they don't share the cultural experiences. While I support diversity in a film's characters, it really only works when children can empathize with the bulk of the characters.And is it necessary to put images of seemingly stoned rastafarians in a children's movie? It seems to me that, as is the case with many Disney and other animated efforts in the past 70 years, only supports racial stereotypes.Overall, though, the story is simple and may have a valuable lesson for the child who is actually able to stay with the film to the end. There are just too many obstacles to arriving at the end, regardless of how visually appealing the film may be. Take care.",4,1,7,10 December 2004
