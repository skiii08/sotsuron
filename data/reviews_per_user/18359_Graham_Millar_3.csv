Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 'Phantom Plot' Fails to Menace
","The Phantom Menace blows.  Cartoonish and gangly, this latest endeavor from The Lucas Emporium, Inc. seemed to think it was such a sparkling epic that it could easily afford to overlook such passÃ© film staples as plot, acting, and dialogue, none of which make an appearance anywhere in the movie.  Too dependent on the 'cuteness' of the omnipresently and incomprehensibly irksome Jar Jar Binks (oh, but what a great action figure he'll make!), the visual spectacle of its overworked digital landscapes (like something from the pages of a 'Where's Waldo' book), and the dubious believability of the stone-faced, deadpan performance of Natalie Portman as Queen Abidala (did these actors get to create their own accents?), the movie falls limply and quite disappointingly short of its cult-classic predecessors.The adorable little lead actor and the light-saber scenes (which looked like replays of the Luke/Vader fights with more money dumped into them) did little to float this barge.  Perhaps the robotic Portman -- who had as many facial expressions as the sharpshooting battledroids -- would have been better cast as a droid herself.  Even the pivotal race sequence looked over-produced and under-thought, which proved to be the theme for the entire film.At the end though, it had the definite taste of a prequel, and it did leave me with a strong hunch that better things are to come.  Meanwhile, however, I can only recommend this movie to the die-hardest of 'Star Wars' zealots, much as I'd recommend 'Star Trek V' to trekkies.",5,0,1,13 June 1999
Schindler's List," Objet d' art
","Schindler's List is unquestionably the finest re-enactment of Holocaust horror there can ever be. Dubious historical accuracy aside, it's infinitely more important for the audience to recognize how perfectly the film duplicates the emotional impact of the Holocaust. One cannot feel such fear, shame, rage or love for humanity through any other means. To see this film is to witness the full potential for human good and human evil, side by side. To weep as you watch is not to fall prey to the director's manipulative imagery, but to acknowledge the abhorrent events of the time. You can watch it any way you want; my recommendation to take the fullest advantage of the magnificent craft employed by the director is to let yourself be placed right inside it as you watch, without fear or trepidation.",10,9,18,15 March 1999
The Green Mile," Soporific epic has moments.
","This widely praised film deigns slowly, as a parent to a child, right up until its first execution, which hits the audience over the head with a scene of a violent, tremorous death and ensuing smoke wisping from the corpse's char-broiled body. It then resumes its gentle preach until the second execution, which displays, in lugubrious detail, flames ripping up the side of a man's head, thoroughly cooking his flesh and gassing witnesses out of the room as he screams and while the guards debate the matter.Special effects, like countless modern films, do not enhance anything but rather only distract. Patience while enduring the slumberous opening and the presentation of unimaginative characters, plus the exhausted screen writing standard of the old man telling his drawn out story in a flashback, is rewarded by a good scene of men crying and an inspiring last line.Many details were unnecessary, and at over three hours long, it seems someone released the uncut version by mistake. Short naps do not run the risk of missing vital plot developments. At least 45 minutes should have been whacked.For an infinitely better Stephen King film, see 'The Shawshank Redemption'.",6,1,2,2 July 2000
