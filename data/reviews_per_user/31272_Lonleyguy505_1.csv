Requiem for a Dream," This movie got screwed
","Lord of the Rings sucked!!!! But yet it got all the Academy Awards. Requiem for a Dream should of swepped the awards. Ellen Burstyn should of easily gotten best actress. And Jared Leto should of been awarded the best actor award. This movie was the most shocking movie i have ever seen. No movie has ever broke me down to tears at the end. If i were a heroin addict I would quit after watching the sad, dramatic, depiction of the truth behind drugs. Everyone who loves this movie I recommend the novel. The novel is even more eye opening. Darren Aronofsky, although he only has created two films, he will be the next Oliver Stone. Get used to his movies, you will see them for years to come.",Null,0,1,13 November 2004
