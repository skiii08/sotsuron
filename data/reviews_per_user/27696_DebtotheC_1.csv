The Equalizer," Denzel's VERY BEST! in years!
","I didn't know for sure until I saw the list of credits listed herein, but I definitely had a feeling that Antoine Fuqua had something to do w/this film, and that feeling went on to be justified. Unlike 'Training Day', an entirely moral man was to be portrayed--a man who believes in the rights of the 'little guy' and that right should conquer over evil, which McCall goes on to do. I loved this film and loved the role that Denzel plays in it. Denzel (almost) always has chosen to portray great characters in film. Sometimes evil; more often moral, but ALWAYS interesting and this film does that with a capital I! My only complaint is that I wish something would have been shown a little bit earlier about what happened to Alina, since her survival was really what McCall was fighting for from the very beginning. But I am by nature, a bit of a nit-picker--only real complaint though!",9,0,1,9 June 2015
