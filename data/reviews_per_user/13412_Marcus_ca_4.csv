Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Everything you could expect, and more...
","I was hearing a lot of comments that the movie wasn't as good as the hype made it out to be, but after seeing it opening night it was everything I expected.  The movie was awesome, especially the light-sabre fight scene, and did an excellent job of sparking a lot of a new interest in the films to follow as the storyline unfolds.  One thing that did take some getting used to was the overwhelming use of computer graphics in the movie (but we knew that was coming) and my one complaint would have to be Jar Jar's crazy accent - did anyone know what he was saying half the time?  Overall, Phantom Menace rocked and is sure to give way to a whole new generation of Star Wars followers.",8,0,0,20 May 1999
American Psycho," Ummm, is there a plot to this movie?
","Ok, sure a person could rant and rave about how this movie is an extraordinary essay of the human psyche gone wrong, mushed into the materialism of the 1980's.  Or, a person could sit there dumbfounded for the first half of the movie until they get tired of trying to figure out what the point of it is, and leave to go get some take-out and go watch something good on TV.  I mean, seriously, this may be an attempt to twist our minds and shock us, but there are waaaay better movies a person can rent for that. The movie had very little plot, Bateman's evolving dementia was hardly believable, and the constant mention of 'Restaurant Reservations' as the definitive status symbol for the 80's businessman was over-killed in the first 10 minutes.  If you really want to see this movie, wait for the VHS, or better yet, the DVD, which I'm sure will be marketed with some sort of 'Extra Uncut Footage' or 'Special Edition' packaging for an extra $10.",5,0,1,14 April 2000
Coyote Ugly," Big Disappointment
","From the previews this movie looked like it was going to be hot...music, dancing, bar, fun, girls with attitude, just lots of fun.  Instead it was full of the usual slew of cheesy cliches - the concerned father who can't care for himself and is worried about his baby girl, the love interest, the struggling artist in New York.  So predictable and so lacking in what it what it could have been, but that's why it got a PG rating I guess.",6,0,1,4 August 2000
Gladiator," A Stunning and Amazing Film That Will Move Your Soul
","Before seeing this movie and having only the preview to rely on, I honestly believed that although it looked entertaining and full of action, Gladiator would be mediocre - another over-hyped, blood-and-guts film that would be way too long.After just watching it however, I am completely humbled.  This film is amazing.  Everything about it, from the cinematography, to the costumes, the special effects, the score (I am in love with the score!), and even the acting, was outstanding.  You know a movie is really good when it is three hours long and you hardly even notice it from all the mind-blowing action and gorgeous scenery on screen.  The story itself is also well-done, but I will save all the details for your own visit to the theatre, which I definitely recommend (and find the one with the biggest screen and best sound system possible!).  It does contain a lot of violence and 'gore', but if you can handle it you will appreciate everything else the movie has to offer.Not only does Gladiator instill an awe-inspiring sense of wonder and appreciation for history by capturing all the splendour, grandeur, and political complexity of Ancient Rome near the end of its empirical might, but it also has embedded within its story that eternal theme of peace and serenity for which every soul searches.",10,0,0,5 May 2000
