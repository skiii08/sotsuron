The Blair Witch Project," No Spoilers, Just The Facts...
","Oh dear.  What a calamity.  This movie had so much promise, so much potential greatness - so what happened?  Why did this excellent on paper movie, not do the business on film?I know exactly why - a weak script, average performances and too much pre-release hype.  To go into more detail..Before I begin, the movies as most people clearly know is far from original - we have seen this done before and far better in Cannibal Holocaust, so we are not seeing anything new, irrespective of what Hollywood will tell us.
OK, the initial premise is good - it makes you want to see it, and to see how the future of these guys unfolds.  However, the main problem lies within - you never feel as if you are with these people.  At times, you feel yourself rooting for the Blair Witch.  I could have produced very similar results if I took 2 friends camping ANYWHERE in England, left a Hi-8 camera running throughout.  There was a severe lack of substance in this movie - although you may think that a lot happened as you leave the aisles, nothing really did.There were some good moments in this, and as a whole, I was intrigued to see how things would unfold - at several points, I found it difficult to take my eyes off the screen.  However, the other 75 minutes of this movie left the viewer wanting, and delivered nothing.  As we know, this is an amateur production - myself being an amateur film-maker, I spent a lot of the time figuring out how shots were produced - but this also was it's major downfall.  Scenes of argument and confrontation, always seemed 2 seconds away from total hilarity, as if the actors were ready to roll around the floor laughing.  Not a good sign.So to sum up - Blair Witch is a horror movie?  sadly, no.  Never will be - not in this lifetime.",5,0,2,31 October 1999
