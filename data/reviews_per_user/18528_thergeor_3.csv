Walk the Line," good
","This movie kept my interest the whole way, based off of really good acting and a great story. It shows the trials of addiction, unhealthy relationships, but also has a good love story and shows that fame isn't always the best thing for you and people around you.",8,1,1,29 January 2019

","This movie isn't a baseball movie, but it uses baseball as a way to show the struggles of black americans during this time period. Jackie Robinson was a really inspiring and brave man, and this movie shows it well.",8,0,1,12 February 2019
Back to the Future," classic movie
","This movie is really entertaining and they show differences in time periods really well. The relationships between Micheal J Fox and his parents are really funny and interesting, it makes you think what would you do if you were in high school with your parents.",8,0,0,14 February 2019
