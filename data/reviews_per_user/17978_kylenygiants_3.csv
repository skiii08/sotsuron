The Ring," Boring Boring Boring
","What can i say about this movie. i cant say anything except 'BORING'. I heard everybody talking about how scary this movie was and they couldn't answer the phone in a week. So i rented it. I was said to myself, 'Its only a movie. Its only a movie.' So i wouldn't get freaked out. Then the movie was over. I was practically asleep. Even Scary Movie 3 was even scarier. they just spoof the ring. The only part thats scary in the movie was when Aymara killed that guy. Yawn. I am getting tired of writing this bad review. So i will close this paragraph up with a bad review by saying, THIS MOVIE SUCKED!THIS MOVIE SUCKED! THIS MOVIE SUCKED! THIS MOVIE SUCKED!",2,1,5,10 August 2006
Spider-Man," the greatest super hero movie ever
","Spiderman is the greatest superhero movie ever. When i started to watch this, i was just thinking a mediocre movie. But after i saw it, i was in shock. I couldn't wait for the second one too come out. of course it wasn't as good as the first one though but it was good. Now i can't wait for the third one. This is one of my favorite movies. It was great. The special effects were good. The plot was awesome. There was no boring part in the movie. The cast was cool. Everything was cool in this movie. I thought the battle over time square could have been longer though. That was the only thing i would change in the movie. i would give it 10/10 stars",10,0,1,10 August 2006
Saving Private Ryan," the best movie ever
","Saving Private Ryan is the best movie i've seen. It shows what war was like and what the men had to go through. Its about 8 men risking their lives just to save one man. Steven Speilburg did an awesome job directing this movie. I cant say one bad thing about this movie. I was just amazed. I cant believe this isn't in the top ten of the top 250 movies. If you haven't seen this movie, you are missing out. This film has a great cast, and a great director. The greatest war movie ever is the best movie ever made. Speilburg does a very great job at recreating the D-day scene. There is only one movie you have to see in your lifetime and that is Saving Private Ryan. 10/10 stars.",10,2,3,10 August 2006
