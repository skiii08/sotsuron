Deja Vu," Not a thriller as much as an action-flick
","When I walked into the cinema last night I didn't have great expectations. Tony Scott isn't my type of director. My personal opinion is that he is very overrated even though he isn't very well known. 'Enemy of the state', 'Man on fire' and 'Spygame' isn't really great work in the art of directing. 'Top gun' is an amusement to my parents that grew up in that generation, but I don't really care for it. Secondly. A Jerry Brockheimer production. I'm not a fan of mass produced expensive movies that are made to make money. Now I'll stop throwing my opinions on Scott and Bruckheimer at you. But my point remains standing. I didn't have great expectations on this movie.******************SPOILER*************** Anyway. I sat down in my chair thinking I was going to see a thriller. The first few minutes went fast (I noticed that Jerry Bruckheimers name appeared three times (on separate locations) in the first three minutes of the film. His Logo, 'A J. Bruckheimer production' and 'Produced by J. Bruckheimer'. The man obviously loves to be known for his great producing skills.) and it seems like it's going to be a nice movie. I thought I had judged the movie to fast. Then the ship explodes in a rather expensive computer-animated explosion. I can't say anything else then that the explosion is very entangling.(Bonus to Scott if he's the one that picked the Beach Boys song on the radio) OK. let me just say that the first 1/3 of the movie is kind of thriller-like. But the last 2/3 is action. No thriller there at all. I think that the average length of all the clips in this movie was about 2 seconds. The movie's pace unbelievably rapid. Which is good...If the story is thin and you need a lot of action, bullets and explosions to compensate. There where a car-chase, a number of bullet festivals and a good ol' crashing into the house with an ambulance stunt. The music could be described simply as 'random post-2000 action-flick beat'. It was far to loud, annoying and I think they actually just had one bar that they looped over and over and over again. Don't listen to anyone that says the story doesn't have any holes in it. The story is one of the least through out creations I have crossed paths with. If you have another opinion on this. Please start a thread on the movie's message-board and we'll discuss it there. There's simply not enough space here to do that. Very strange when he lights a laser-pen on a screen and then the whole town gets power failure. If the screen is actually a portal. Then why doesn't he just jump though it? If the portal only can transport light, the girl should have been able to see them in the control room. Right? One thing that I found very strange was that you (atleast in the Swedish version) never heard the word Deja vu once. The movies had nothing to do with this phenomenon at all. Very strange. Maybe the original script had more scenes where this was discussed and someone cut them out.*Cough* Producer *Cough*. I sure hope so because it really left me hanging when the movie was over. It felt like they never got to the point. One more thing. You never got to know why the bad guy was bad. You never got to know anything about him. This is something that I found so annoying that I decided to post this comment in the first place... Why did he even blow up the ship in the first place? It makes no sense because we never got to know him or his intentions!Conclusion: If you like action-flicks: See Deja vu. It's a nonstop action-movie that has some, but not to much, clever twists and turns. If you like thrillers: Don't expect to much. If you like good movies: Don't expect to much. If you want to spend two hours of you life and never get them back: See the movie. It will entertain you.",3,5,11,30 December 2006
