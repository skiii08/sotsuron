Lucky Number Slevin," Not what I was looking for........BETTER
","When I saw the ads for this movie I thought it was going to be another whimsical dark crime comedy like Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrles. Wow I was wrong, not only was the dialog witty fast paced and smart, but it kept you constantly guessing. It is a very well conceived plot with great development that makes you think for yourself. There's twists turns, intense drama that makes you hate, and few good laughs, but all around one of the best crime/ thriller movies I've seen. I highly recommend this film. Anyone with a brain can enjoy the fast script and hidden quirks. Not to mention excellent performances by everyone in the cast, each character is fresh and different and they all have their quirks. Also an acting shout out to Josh Hartnett, his performance in Hollywood Homocide was pretty pathetic but this definitely made up for it and makes me think he is capable of being more than a pretty boy.",9,1,2,10 November 2007

","Zach Snyder has created a masterpiece. A beautiful and enthralling blend of cinema and animation. The entire movie was eye-candy and the acting was very well done too, not just Gerard Butler performed well in this movie, from the creepy and soft egotism of Xerxes to the madness and rage of Captain. Not only is the acting worth praise, but the dialect as well, there was not one moment in this film where I groaned in my head or thought that this movie had used a disgusting clichÃ©. In the whole, this piece of cinematic art will disappoint no one it is on a steadfast road and there will be a great chance that it will be a favorite of my own children in the far future. Magnificent, elegant, outstanding.",10,2,7,11 March 2007
