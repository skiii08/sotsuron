Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Can`t wait to see it again!`
","I found this movie to be one of the most entertaining that I have seen in a long time. What was done in to make this movie possible leaves me in awe! The computer work was fabulous. The story line gives you so much of that 'Oh, I just knew that was the way it was' if you saw the original Star Wars with Mark Hamill. The Jedi fight scenes were so well done that you have no option but to think that they are really fighting withLight Sabers. I found myself on the edge of my seat with each thrust, each spin, each jump. This movie seems to delve into the religious and cultural part of it`s characters as well which was sadly lacking from it`s forbearer. It was an important part of the scenario. The cities as well as the world were fantastic. I love the Gungan city and all the Aquatic characters. They were so believable. Some people laugh at them but who are we to say that on a planet far, far, away these creatures are not looking at us and laughing too!! Jar Jar Binks was great and the movie would have been lacking without his presence. He kept me laughing that`s for sure! The battle of the Droids was really well done. Kudos to those who created this part of the movie. What I liked most about the Battle Droids was that they were  surprisingly intelligent. There was a thought process that exceeds any computerized system today. Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn I have to say was my favorite character. (ok, Jar Jar was the funniest!)His screen presence was strong and you could feel the leadership and confidence in him. I will see it again and again!!",Null,0,0,22 June 1999
