Marie Antoinette," Gorgeous movie cut short
","This movie had the potential to be great.I thought I would be put off by the modern soundtrack, but what really annoyed me was that Sofia Coppola cut off the movie. I wanted Copploa to show the grueling, horrible adversity that Marie Antoinette had to go through with her husband's execution, the torture of her children, the horrifying trial she was put through, and to her own humbling execution.It was great up till then...sure, a few liberties here and there, but over all, it was gorgeous. The music, the shots, the costumes, everything...the parts with Louis Auguste and Marie Antoinette's consummation was both hilarious and heart breaking.I was a bit miffed they didn't include Louis Charles...the time line may have been a bit off. I'm pretty sure he was born by the time the French peasants stormed the Bastille. And when Louis Auguste asks Marie Antoinette about the lime avenue...that was actually asked to his sister, Elisabeth.Rose Byrne as Duchesse de Polignac was delightful though! I think she really captured the lively spirit of the Queen's favorite. Mary Nighy was great as Lamballe, and the Molly Shannon and Shirley Henderson was hilarious as the aunts. I also really enjoyed Judy Davis as the Comtesse 'Etiquette'.From a historical point of view, I loved how personal Marie Antoinette was and the great attention to detail they paid to her. This movie was about a young woman thrust into a political turmoil way beyond her years. In that, they did a fantastic job. It is people who ultimately shape the way history happens and I absolutely loved how personal this film was.All in all, good movie...but it had the potential to be much better. However I would rather have a historical movie that is okay than no historical movie at all.",10,1,3,6 November 2006
The Illusionist," Surprising, beautiful period piece, excellent acting
","I don't know how much of this movie was historically accurate, but I loved it.I was most worried about Jessica Biel, because honestly, I can only see her as Mary from 7th Heaven trying to break out into movies and not doing very well (with Summer Catch and Stealth). But Jessica Biel surprised me...she was actually really good and I think she has a bright future in movies if she continues in this direction.Plus...Rufus Sewell? Edward Norton? Paul Giamatti? Excellent acting from everyone! Rufus Sewell is always amazing in the roles I've seen him in, and Edward Norton...wow, that man is awesome.I loved the music and the swirling intro at the beginning and everything about the set was so lavish and so beautiful.Great movie. :)",10,3,4,30 September 2006
Pride & Prejudice," A refreshing, exhilarating rendering of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice
","This movie was absolutely breathtaking. It was simply...exquisite. It was beautiful, gorgeous, excellent, wonderful...oh, it was just so good! The way it was shot...oh, Lord, England's countrysides are beautiful! And there was this awesome (albeit dizzying) part where you got to see through Elizabeth's eyes as she swung in circles on a swing...great way to suck the audience in. And wow, I don't remember seeing P & P look this good! The attention to detail in the sets and costumes was superb. And Darcy...Darcy was so sexy. 'You have bewitched me body and soul. I...love you and cannot bear to be parted from you.' *swoon* And the music...so soft, so gentle...so calm and soothing. Gorgeous. I want to get this soundtrack...this film transports me to that feeling of sublime happiness. And it's so romantic! I mean, that sounds girlie...but, the romance was beautiful! It made me cry. I wanted a dashing Darcy to stride purposely through a field to tell me that he loved me! There was some stuff they left out. Like the Hursts. Who? Exactly. I didn't even know they were left out until I started to read the book again last night. The film stayed true to the story of P&P and rendered it hopelessly lovely.",10,8,14,28 November 2005
Happy Feet," Funny, but a bit too angsty
","I liked this movie. At least, the parts with just the penguins and just the 'happy' stuff.I didn't find the angsty doom and gloom of the penguin elders necessary, nor did I find the whole human angle necessary at all as well. Did anyone else feel the environmental vibe to this? I loved Ramon, and Lovelace, and Mumble and all the funny bits with the one liners but Mumble's quest that included deep sea angst was a bit too much. I don't think that a fun kid's movie should've been overshadowed with messages about preserving nature and animal cruelty in zoos.And was Mumble's face staying baby-like throughout the entire movie on purpose? All the baby penguins were adorable but maybe Mumble's face was suppose to reflect Elijah Wood's face in real life? Perpetually baby-like?The singing and dancing parts were, however, delightful. I love musicals like this and the penguins put up quite a show. Bravo to them. :) The amigos were a favorite part of the film and were a great laugh all around.",7,1,3,26 November 2006
