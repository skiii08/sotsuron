The Blair Witch Project," duuuuuuuuh
","I feel sorry for anyone who genuinely felt creeped out by this movie.  For me, it was like watching America's Funniest Home Videos.   Halfway through, I was just waiting for it to end.  Quickly.  These were 3 of the stupidest people I've ever seen in real life or on screen and, since they were playing themselves, I can only assume that they're not particularly bright in real life.  In conclusion, the concept could have worked.  The product, thanks to the dummies, didn't.",1,1,2,8 November 1999
The Legend of Bagger Vance," ugh
","This movie, with its agonizingly drawn-out 60's-style camerawork and storyline, is apparently out to, singlehandedly, undo all of Tiger Wood's work to bring golf into the mainstream of young America.  Personally, I love golf, but this film made me want to clone myself so that we could both not see this movie.  While Will Smith did an admirable job of filling a role that was obviously written for someone twenty to thirty years his senior, Matt Damon once again proves himself to be a magnificently overrated actor. Robert Redford?  Please, no more directing!  I don't know how many more of those long closeups of the main character's 'soulful eyes' I can take. Charlize Theron, while an incredibly talented person, has yet to land another role since 'The Devil's Advocate' that proves it.  Unfortunately, this is no exception.",3,1,3,26 April 2001
Scary Movie 2," The Wayans Brothers owe me $
","They Wayans Brothers owe me $16.05!  That's $7.00 each for two tickets and $2.05 for the popcorn I was forced to fling at the screen.  It would appear that the only reason they made a sequel, aside from lots of cash from a slow-witted studio, was to include whatever lame jokes might have been left out of the first one.  I spent the first hour telling myself that, at least, the last half would be funny.  Little did I know that the 'last half' was fifteen minutes long and, no, it only got more inane.  I should have known we were in trouble when the opening gag --- no pun intended ---ripped off 'The Exorcist', quite possible the most-spoofed-to-death movie ever.  This turkey would have been funnier if they had slapped the credits on 'I'm Gonna Get You Sucka' and played that instead.",1,0,1,16 July 2001
The Green Mile," wonderful, but....
","After reading the book, I was expecting a great movie and that's exactly what I saw.  Although The Green Mile is 3 hours long, I never noticed.  The entire audience was caught up in it and I could hear people around me just bawling.  That said, this movie was 5 minutes too long.  Right at the end, it seemed like Darabont suddenly felt the need to explain what needed no explanation.  Rather than let the story and images speak for themselves, he crammed way too much into the end.  As a result, the last few scenes with Dabbs Greer nearly completely ruin the incredible movie that had been built to that point.",9,0,0,14 December 1999
