Despicable Me 2," Comedy Genre at its best!!!
","DM2 is definitely a competitive movie to its prequel,you may not find the stealing of moon this time though. Except the plot,sequel is way better than its prequel especially in terms of comedy. Steve Carell has outdone himself really. There is more importance to Elsie Kate Fisher(Agnes) here as the directors know well what we'd like to see. I bet you cannot find any other animation films this much funnier. Both the directors are the smartest ever i've seen. Budget is low as movie already soars in Box office. They knew exactly what to do to make the Box office come their way. Yep,I am talking about the minions. When I watched the prequel I never thought they were making a sequel giving more value to minions. But they found a way. That was spot on! What I still wonder is whatever they tried to give us a comedy,it never failed anytime. That is never easy. Great stuff! May be here, we need Tom Hanks' voice to get a lot of votes for this wonderful movie. Come on! All go see this. Don't waste your life by being miss this funniest flick. When it comes to music, Happy song is just amazing. Its safe to say that background music is brilliant as always. Minions at its best during the climax. Final words: This is surely one of the greatest animation movies of the century. Just spend your bucks to encourage both the directors to make another splendid movie. Of course,we can anticipate more from them as Sandra Bullock (Richest Paid Actress) is pulled for their next one.",10,3,5,15 July 2013
Interstellar," First half is Masterpiece and second half is Nolanpiece
","Nolan has once again outdone himself. I do not have enough adjectives to describe this movie. It's ineffable.It's pure class.Exquisite.Mathew has done his best and Hans Zimmer's another best.Perfect and possibly the best sci-fi flick of the millennium.No one has explained about time travel so far,but we got Nolan here.Why worry? He has explained in his typical way. Brilliance all the way.Love you Sir Chris Nolan.Michael Caine,Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain all rocked very well too.As Nolan said,watch the movie at least twice in theatres. Once the bluray comes,we shall own the movie.",10,2,11,27 November 2014
