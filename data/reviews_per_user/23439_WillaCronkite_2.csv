Walk the Line," Phoenix Ain't No Johnny Cash
","He never once really captured Johnny Cash's essence. He seems like a lightweight where Johnny Cash was a heavyweight. His voice sounded phony, not nearly as deep, ragged, or stark as the real Johnny Cash. Phoenix's voice sounds like a whispery frat boy at times when he sings....a sound the real Johnny Cash was incapable of making. And he doesn't seem remotely country enough. He doesn't sound or act like a real hardscrabble country man. Very disappointing. It's interesting to me how easily fooled some folks are by the most half-baked attempt at a Southern or country accent. This is the kind of film that makes you realize how truly great COAL MINER'S DAUGHTER and RAY are. Those were films where--even if you had spent countless hours watching the original performer---the actor and performer merged in your mind on screen in the movie biography.",4,1,5,4 March 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A Masterpiece---for Trolls
","Unbelievably dull and tedious.  A movie for those who like watching trolls run around frantically for three hours.  Only of interest if you possess the stunted sensibility of a troll or haven't developed beyond an infantile sensibility.  Worst of all is how one feels like this has all been done before, endlessly, over and over in other movies; most of them not much better or worse than this drek.  When that hack Lucas ripped off the Tolkein books in so many ways, he began this tired treadmill of effects-driven troll movies devouring themselves endlessly.  When will it ever end. The fact that this empty-headed eye-candy is so popular speaks volumes about the stunted, easily-amused state of a vast cross-section of current society; forever in arrested development; sucking down whatever weak green media-hyped pablum is fed them.",Null,1,2,9 January 2004
