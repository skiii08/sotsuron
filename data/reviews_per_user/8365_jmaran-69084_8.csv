The Incredible Hulk," Pretty much a bore.
","I loved 'The Incredible Hulk' as a kid so I was really looking forward to watching this movie. What a complete disappointment. The action didn't even start until half-way into the move, and it was completely predictable. This movie was simply boring from start to finish and Edward Norton as Bruce Banner? I don't think so. I don't write long reviews so I won't list all the really lame things about this movie. Either take my word for it that it has very little redeeming value and and skip this one, or watch it and be prepared to be bored out of your mind.",3,1,4,16 November 2018
Star Trek," Excellent entertainment.
","Yep, there are holes in the story. Putting that aside, this is great fun to watch. If they had done a bit better job of not being sloppy about those storyline holes, this movie would be a 10!I'm a Trekkie from way back, but I have to disagree that the holes in this movie were any worse the many holes in the storylines of the original TV series. Give it a break, Trekkies, and enjoy this for what it is. We can't expect exact duplication of characters, either. These folks did a very decent job with their characters. If I have any complaint at all it is with Spock and Uhura having an affair. That was a bit of a stretch too far.The second movie in the trilogy isn't bad, either, although the aliens at the beginning were a bit ridiculous. Overall, I'd give it a 7. But the third movie? Well, that really was a waste of time. The holes in that storyline made the holes in the first look like pin holes. So I guess I do have my limit on just how bad a storyline can be and still be forgiven. I'm afraid the 3rd movie has zero redeeming qualities. I give it a 2 only because Pine still manages to do some great acting given a terrible script.",8,2,7,17 November 2018
The Bourne Identity," OK movie but . . .
","Matt Damon as Jason Bourne? Uh, no. Completely unbelievable, thus unwatchable. Very bad casting of the main character. Movie was OK otherwise, but not even close to the excitement of the books.",3,0,1,9 February 2020
Justice League," I love a good superhero movie but . . .
","This was trash. I turned it off after about 15 minutes. Really, really bad.",1,2,7,26 October 2018
Man of Steel," This movie had such promise but went south fast.
","The movie was moving along pretty well - for the first 35 minutes - but lost its way fairly quickly. Let me just say the moment Lois Lane appeared on the scene, it was all over for me. The way in which her character was written was foolish. I was ready to deal with that, but at the 40-minute mark, Clark inexplicably comes across a space craft. It's bad enough they made Lois look like a jerk with a huge chip on her shoulder trying to play it tough with lines like, 'Are we finished comparing dicks?', but to quickly follow that up with a scene that is so illogical it stretches one's imagination beyond bounds told me the rest of the movie was probably a loser. I didn't waste my time watching the rest of it.",1,1,10,28 October 2018
War Machine," Ho Hum
","If I'm supposed to take the message seriously, it would help if Pitt wasn't acting the fool. He's either lost his mojo, or he did this one just for the money. He was so bad, I couldn't finish watching the movie.",5,1,3,7 June 2018
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," Needed a little more grit.
","This was a decent movie with a great story to tell, but the backstory was handled a little too soft and pretty - it needed more grit to fit the topic. Actually, the entire movie was a little too soft and pretty, but I've watched far worse.",6,1,2,23 October 2018
Arrival," Interesting concept that doesn't pan out
","This movie is full of plot holes from start to finish. Even worse, the entire movie was bland, slow, boring and pointless. If you're expecting a great sci-fi movie, let me tell you that the aliens arrive at the start, leave at the end, and that's it - nothing much in between. This is a movie more about the self-actualization the main character goes through than anything else, but the music was good, I'll give it that.",1,1,6,22 February 2020
