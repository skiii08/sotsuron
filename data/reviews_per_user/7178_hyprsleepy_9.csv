Requiem for a Dream," Not just a movie about drugs
","To just call it a drug movie is totally missing the point of the movie, in my opinion. A requiem is a song that is played in mourning for the dead. Therefore the title literally means a song mourning the death of a dream. Listen to the soundtrack and you will hear what I'm talking about.I always thought it was interesting that Jennifer Connelly's character Marion Silver and Marlon Wayans' character Tyrone C Love are very much like opposites of each other. Marion comes from a rich family who gave her money but not love, while Ty is from a poor family that gave him love but had no money. Marion is very fragile because no one ever cared for her and she lacks the self confidence necessary to succeed. Inversely, Ty's mother didn't care if he was rich or successful but he always felt that it was the only way he'd be worthy of her love.They're all chasing a dream, and they all want someone to love them, but it's strange because they already have that. They just can't see it.This movie is one of my all time favorites and one of the most emotional experiences I've ever had while watching a film. 10/10 stars.",Null,2,4,28 February 2007
Closer," Dialogue driven film with an award winning cast
","Six years after the movie release of Closer and 850+ reviews to sift though...I don't know how mine will be noticed so this is mostly for my own gratification and to help me remember.I instantly loved Closer. It's so wonderful to experience a film that goes back to the basics: characters, great writing, focusing on dialogue. It's unusual nowadays. The way the characters all played off each other, the wordplay, and the verbally jousting, it was all exceptionally entertaining. I think we've really lost that in movies. It's very unusual to hear fantastic dialogue and to hear intelligent people interacting. From the witty things they say while seducing each other to the brutally honest things that we all think but don't necessarily say - it's all here. There are so many great lines and so many great scenes. The theme song, The Blower's Daughter, is perfect and represents the movie in a nutshell. Be warned that this isn't a movie to share with the kids and it isn't for the faint of heart or for those who want a more standard romance to watch. There will be those that will be shocked by or upset by this film and find it offensive or difficult to watch.Closer is an adaption of a play written by Patrick Marber. Cliven Owen actually performed this play in the original London stage production although at that time he was playing the character of Dan instead of Larry! It's impressive to see how well he was able to totally change his perspective and act so convincingly as Larry. After seeing Closer I really couldn't envision him being anyone else. The great thing about a movie vs. a play is that you don't have to shout your lines and it can feel that much more real and intimate.While there may only be four characters to work with you get a deep dive into each of them. In my opinion this is all four actor's best work ever.",Null,1,2,23 December 2010
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Quick Comparison of both versions - both excellent in their own right
","Here is a rundown of the differences in the two movies:-MIKAEL BLOMKVIST-American - Blomkvist is played as more of a tough guy and not a good guy. His flaws are laid bare and he shows himself to be much more detached than emotional.Swedish - This is the 'good guy' side of Mikael. He is sensitive, caring, and smart. He shows a protective side when it comes to Lisbeth. Physically speaking the Swedish Blomkvist doesn't look as sturdy as his American counterpart. He has a gut and appears to be quite a bit older than Lisbeth which can make the relationship between them more shudder inducing and probably accounts for why there are fewer sex scenes between them in the Swedish version. -LISBETH SALANDER-American - Perhaps because Blomkvist was made into such a strong character Lisbeth was then morphed into a more withdrawn and vulnerable girl so as to complement the new Blomkvist. She still has attitude, aggression, and rage but she also exhibits a quiet shy side that was not in the original as well as more of a romantic side.Swedish - In this version Lisbeth is not shy, not gentle, and not nice. She doesn't chase Blomkvist - he chases her. She perfectly embodies everything you think of when you think of a strong female lead and has an unpredictability and edge to her that is exciting to watch. Her dragon tattoo is much, much better.-OVERALL- I liked the American Mikael and the Swedish Lisbeth. While I may prefer a scene or two from the Swedish version, such as the ending, overall I enjoyed the American version more. On the flip side, I can understand why some may hate this version because Lisbeth was their favorite character and she's been changed into something they don't like. For me, the modifications to Lisbeth's character weren't severe enough to put me off.The Swedish version captured a cult following for a reason and I would recommend both to anyone who has an interest in darker gritty movies that have a raw intensity to them. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo isn't for the faint of heart and that's what I love about it!",Null,223,328,22 December 2011
District 9," This movie is often misunderstood
","District 9 is an action packed science fiction film that deals with morality and ethics.After watching it a second time I realized that what the human news reporters thought was a 'control module' that dropped off the mother ship was really Christopher's ship! It pulled on my heart strings when watching the father & son bond and made me wish I had a kid of my own. The social commentary was sharp and did not pull any punches, which is probably why it hurt a few people's feelings and ruffled some feathers. Not everyone will like or identify with the main character and if this is a sticking point for you then you may dislike the film because he's not a terribly likable guy.In regards to the negative comments: #1. Some wonder why the aliens would allow the humans to boss them around even when they were stronger and had such great technology and weapons. It was mentioned in the movie that the aliens were very docile and easy to command. This is probably because they were 'workers' and more akin to insects such as ants and bees than mammals. It is normal for us to think that aliens would think like us, but this is assuming far too much.#2. District 9 takes the struggle of the blacks in Africa during the apartheid and turns it on it's head - making the blacks the ones who were being racist and cruel. This has angered some blacks who think that movie makes them look bad, but hey anyone can discriminate against other humans (or species). The main character's name is a very common one among the white oppressors and the Prawn's language has a lot of clicking sounds, much like the Bantu tribes that were victims of the apartheid. There really were signs many years ago saying that blacks were not allowed. This wasn't a clumsy half-hearted attempt at a historical connection as some have asserted.#3. Some think that the movie makes humans look bad or that the way they behaved was unrealistic. Humans have the capacity to be bad though! If aliens landed on earth and needed our assistance and the whole world was watching, yes we would help them. You know no country would allow themselves to be publicly shown to be heartless. No they would not blow up the ship or attack it, especially without provocation. Once they were on the ground yes, we would quarantine them so that they were separate from the human population. That's only smart and a good safety precaution. Yes, we would monitor them militarily, especially upon first contact as oral communication would be difficult or impossible thus leaving force as the only universal language available. Of course we would build them shanties and not mansions. Is it likely that any humans who lived near the aliens would feel about as comfortable as they would living next to a maximum security prison? Absolutely. Would companies that dealt with weapons be interested in the aliens, sure. Would such companies have the money to push law makers around and put themselves into a favorable position to gather technology? Probably. This isn't a plot hole as previous commenters have suggested. The movie is quite logical and realistic in it's depiction of how humans would react if aliens like the Prawns were found hungry, dying, and in bad shape.District 9 has an important message - do not judge a book by its cover. Something we all should remember but too often forget.",Null,3,5,19 September 2009
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," I saw this when it first came out but didn't have an IMDb account at the time
","I've never had a movie break me down and make my heart ache the way this one did when I first watched it (in the theater no less). This could be an unfair comparison though since I had a recent break-up right before watching this movie. Jim Carrey played Joel as a real person and did so in such a believable way that I immediately became impressed with his range when I had been lukewarm about his other attempts at drama.I've known couples like Joel and Clementine and at some scenes I've been them. Of my friends who didn't like the movie they were always people with no experience or very little. I think what makes people love this movie is realizing how realistic it is and respecting that.One of the things that makes Eternal Sunshine stand out is its depth. The movie has little hints for you to find and uncover if you watch it multiple times. If you pay close attention you can see that Joel and Clementine have probably erased each other more than once as have other couples. It makes sense that if your memories are gone but who you are as a person is the same that you'd find the same people attractive and have the same desires and of course the same problems and issues. And so one of the main points of the story is a reminder that, 'Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it'. Therefore, the only way to grow as a person and progress is to keep your memories, no matter how much it hurts. It is part of growing and moving on. It is part of progress.",Null,3,5,23 November 2010
Joker," A work of art and I do not say that lightly
","The acting, the music, the cinematography, the themes - I could gush for hours about the sheer amount of breath taking QUALITY in this film. If you like good cinema you will like this.'Joker' stands as one of the most left wing films I have ever seen that persuasively validates left wing theory, which is funny because they are the ones attacking it without having seen it! Cancel culture is stupid isn't it?I felt the crushing weight and pressure of a cold society that did not care about the working class and that favored the elite. I saw a lonely human being kicked until he decided enough was enough and that resistance was not only the best way, but the only way forward.I never felt more revved up to 'fight the power' and give the middle finger to a corrupt system than after seeing the Joker!The movie doesn't glorify shootings or vigilante justice so much as it makes it clear that if you take away options for people and treat them like they don't matter and don't exist then rebellion and riots WILL HAPPEN. It isn't so much a threat as an inevitability. People need to feel like the game isn't rigged against them to want to play.The way to fix society is to reach out to others more, to be more kind, and to fix the broken corrupt system that lacks humanity and only cares about money.The Joker is a hero for those who society deems garbage and worthless. In the movie there is a protester holding a sign that symbolizes modern-day society and it's connection to this movie perfectly: We are all clowns.",Null,9,17,13 October 2019
Vanilla Sky," What is happiness to you?
","Vanilla Sky's trailer tells us that the movie is full of hot people in a tangled romance and that the movie is fairly fluffy and normal and something you've probably already seen a million times before and that couldn't be further from the truth.It is a haunting, dark, psychological movie that dives into David's subconscious and examines his innermost desires and fears. 'What is happiness to you?' is a line that is used multiple times in this movie. I really connected with the main character as he faced his demons and tried with all his heart to find happiness. Vanilla Sky is a love story but it is also a story of maturing and finding yourself.The best friend of the hot guy who steals all the girls from him is played perfectly by Jason Lee. You can sense the admiration and resentment of David Ames all mixed in together. I've never thought much of Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz or Penelope Cruz till I saw them in this. I figured Tom could only do action and that Diaz could only do comedy before I ran into Vanilla Sky.There's a scene where Cameron Diaz says, 'I swallowed your cum - that means something!' and the whole theater was in shock. We couldn't believe what we were hearing. The director mentions that his intention in that scene was to let us feel as though we were hearing a conversation and listening in on something that is normally private and that's exactly how I felt throughout a lot of the movie.What is happiness to you? It's a personal question that everyone should find out for themselves.",Null,5,8,11 November 2010
Warm Bodies," Funny and Sweet, like Wall-E mixed with a zombie movie
","And they said you couldn't have a zombie romance story. Take that vampires! The zombie R was surprisingly strong, but sensitive, sweet, loving, and protective. He wanted to talk to the pretty girl but had trouble finding the words, or at least vocalizing them. His determination and frantic antics were endearing.Julie was not some wussy victim or brainless babe. It made me happy to see she was tough and could take care of herself. She had a rebellious streak that made her entertaining to watch and a softer affectionate side that showed itself with R.I can honestly say I liked both characters and wanted to see them succeed. I particularly enjoyed the scenes where R eats the brains and we saw more of Julie, her old boyfriend, her father, and how they all fit together. It was heart felt and well-done. The relationships and the complexity of them was less evident in the movie than in the book but I could still feel it. If you liked the movie I highly suggest reading the book, by the way.Warm Bodies was well paced and acted, and one of the better zombie movies I have seen. Watch it, and provided you aren't dead inside, be overcome by it's cuteness!",Null,86,123,7 February 2013
Law Abiding Citizen," A morality tale with plenty of action
","This is a movie that's extremely fun to watch in the theaters because you get to hear and see everyone's reaction to each of his killings. The best one had people actually saying loudly 'wow' and 'oh my god!'.What drew me to the movie was the fact that the hero wasn't going around killing people with his bare hands or face to face. He was doing it with his mind, with careful planning, and deft precision. That was something refreshing to see. I can totally relate to his feelings of anger over the flaws in the justice system and his desire to take matters into his own hands - to make things right.The ending was disappointing but the rest of the film was not and I liked it overall.",Null,262,357,19 October 2009
