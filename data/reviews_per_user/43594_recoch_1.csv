Source Code," Shame on who ever made this movie. Propaganda indoctrinating the minds of defenseless humans.
","I am losing faith in humanity for paying for this garbage. The purpose of this film is not to entertain but to subliminally plant ideas in your head. It has an agenda.Make money from peoples emotions. It is just incredibly sad that Hollywood has make movies that are aligned with current issues to make money.If you buy into this film you also have to buy into the premises it subliminally promotes. You have to accept ideologies like patriotism, dying for you country is good, good looking women and men are always righteous and good. War is sometimes necessary. The government does everything it can to protect their citizens. Just a disgrace and an insult to the paying audience.",1,5,13,22 October 2011
