First Man," Boring to death
","Let's say that it's very well done. Perfect, to say the truth. But soulless.
Very boring. Ideal in case of insomnia",5,0,1,2 June 2020
The Princess Bride," My first DVD
","This was the first DVD-movie I bought, that was a couple years ago. I consider myself as a 'cinema-crazy-about', but I preferred this one before other ones. I actually have hundreds of DVD. What I want to explain it that PB is one of my favourite movie, really wonderful. It doesn't matter how old the movie is, soundtrack is great, characters too. But maybe the best thing is about the story: they tried to make an ironic story about fairy tales, and they obtained one of the best films ever made. I consideer it was only a lucky time: something similar to make a second part of a film, you can get the best, but maybe you can obtain the worst film ever made (Star wars 1, don't you think). It is not only the story, but the script, characters, actors/actreeses, and about everything, director.I can say this movie is one of my favourites. Anybody who can consideer himself as a 'cinefilo', knows about this movie, At least, if not one of its favourites.",10,0,1,27 November 2004
Marriage Story," A very good story, but...
","A very good story, with solid dialogues, great (GREAT) camera work and fine directorial.
Adam Driver is awesome, maybe his best work till today.
Maybe the problem was Scarlett Johansson. I truly hated her after only 30 minutes. I don't know why she changed so much from the very beginning, but acting like a selfish girl was more than enough when Halloween happened in the film. Her work was the perfect portrayal of being the villain of the film whilst doing nothing terrible.",9,8,12,2 January 2020
