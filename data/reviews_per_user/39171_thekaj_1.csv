50 First Dates," Good, but easily could have been great
","This definitely was a good romantic comedy, but take out about 3 minutes worth of footage, and you would have had a great movie.  The plot has already been done before in Groundhog's Day, but this does change it up enough, and Sandler and Barrymore's characters are likeable enough to make it worth the while to see this one.The problem is that it almost seems like after they had this great romantic comedy in the editing room, someone remembered that this is an Adam Sandler movie, and it HAS to have some gross lowbrow humor in it.  So intermixed with the great scenes, they inserted cut away shots of walruses doing some trick, or a one liner from a secondary character like Rob Schneider or Sandler's coworker.  Most of these feel tacked on, aren't that funny, and they all take away from the timing and either the romance or existing humor of the scene.  In the end this movie suffers, although not fatally, from an identity crisis.  Not knowing if it wants to be a straight laced romantic comedy, or lowbrow romantic comedy.",Null,0,0,15 February 2004
