Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," One of the best movies I have seen. I watch a lot of movies and I must admit this is one my favourites. It is definitely worth seeing. Loved it.
",Best scenes in it great story line Robert Downy performed the role excellently. Cannot wait for the third one. You have to see it! It is one of the best movies around. do not listen to the other reviewer because it is not a waste of money. Excellent work with the speed camera. Loved the 'little hazel' scene excellent ending but I wish Irene returns in the next one. Just putting dots in just to fulfil ten lined rules. ................ ..................... ..................... ................ ...................... ........................ ............................ ........ .................. .............. ................ .................. ......... ...........,10,2,3,22 August 2012
