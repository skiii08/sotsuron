Walk the Line," Oscar Worthy?
","Walk the Line was a great bio pic that let's us all see into the life of the mysterious man in black. Joaquin Phoenix gave a great performance, but I'm not convinced it's worthy of an Oscar nomination. I felt, at times that he was trying to hard to act 'mysterious'. Joaquin was never 'lost' in the role, I saw mannerisms and facial expressions that I've seen in his other movies. Don't get me wrong, I'm not bashing, but Jamie Foxx played a far more convincing Ray Charles than Joaquin did of Johnny Cash. Reese Witherspoon, on the other hand, stole the show and deserves a nomination for her role as June Carter. She was very convincing as the quick witted country singer. Reese has played many good roles in the past, but none more believable than this.Definitely see the movie if you are even the slightest bit into Johnny Cash. Highly recommended.",7,1,2,29 November 2005
