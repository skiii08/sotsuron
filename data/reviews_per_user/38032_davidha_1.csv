Casablanca," An unequaled masterpiece to this day....
","It was nice to see this movie get the credit it deserves, i.e. ranked ahead of Citizen Kane.  Although (Kane) is a good movie, it is often regarded as the 'best' movie of all time.  I beg to differ.  Casablanca has no equal. A perfect blend of drama, intrigue, mystery, comedy, and action that few films can accurately boast of, yesterday and today.  Hands down, the best 'flow' of any movie I have ever witnessed.",Null,0,0,18 August 1999
