The Blair Witch Project," Worst movie I've ever seen
","For the cost of the admission, I could have rented 'The Ringmaster', 'Spiceworld', and 'Stop, Or My Mom Will Shoot', been equally as bored.  This movie is utter crap.  The only thing scary about it is contemplating being stuck ANYWHERE with these 3 losers.  If you even consider the possibility that this incident really happened, the world is a better place to live without Heather, Mike and Josh.  Consider that they are surrounded in dry, dead tree leaves, smoking cigarettes, and screaming at each other about how lost they are.  Light a damn  signal fire and someone will come and rescue you!  I think you can hear the sound of small airplanes overhead during the film, and I am expected to believe that these 3 college students can't figure out that they should signal them?I was expecting something like 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' from this film. I got a film I could have made myself.  'Honey, dust off the camcorder; let's get rich!'",1,1,2,7 August 1999
