The Ring," Horses for courses...
","* * * Contains spoilers * * *Okay, so the American remake is a bit different to the Japanese original, -it's bound to be, -different cultures expect different things from their films. Both are good, and complement one another, and maybe this will prompt more people to risk the subtitles and seek out the original.* * * * * * * * * Spoiler alert * * * * * * I thought this film made great viewing, -and at times was genuinely scary, -or at least very creepy. However, I did feel the horse scene was overdone, -almost like finding yourself watching a real car accident, and it really churned my stomach. I enjoyed all the rest so much, it's a shame I'll maybe avoid seeing the film again because of this one scene. The crack of the horses' leg against the ship rail, and it screaming as it was sucked under and into the propeller, is unfortunately the main image I've brought home from the film. I like horror movies and I don't scare easily, but however much I know it 'isn't real', I just don't enjoy seeing an animal getting hurt. I think the point would have come across just as well if the horse had leaped over the rail, and just disappeared into the sea. Gratuitous cruelty, -even represented by cgi effects- lost the film a few points from me.",7,0,0,14 February 2003
