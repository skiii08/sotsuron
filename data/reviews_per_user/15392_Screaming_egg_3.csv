Hereditary," Very scary but not enough!
",80% of the movie is brilliant! But the end..seems like they got bored to write a complete script! Movie had potential to be a classic but ruined it!,5,0,1,17 July 2018
Oldboy," GROSSLY OVERRATED, definitely not a 8/10
","While the scenario had tons of potential , the actual movie is very subpar. Pointless drama & useless violence, lots of unexplained choices and wanna be dramatic music.The movie thinks it's soooo smart, while in fact it is but a pretentious, posing and wannabe-deep failure, who doesn't know if it's a thriller, a drama or a soap opera.",1,3,10,2 December 2018
Don't Breathe," Well deserved 1 Star
",Another movie which tries to be 'deep' and ends up a massive disaster. The plot is full of holes & in the end the evil gold-digger wins.Characters are totally unlikable & the winner makes you mad! Actually if the blonde girl had died and the story was believable it would probably be a decent movie.,1,2,3,7 October 2019
