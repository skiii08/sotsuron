Blade Runner 2049," Bad sequel
","Don't get me wrong this a pretty OK future dystopia sci fi film but it spends far too much time trying to be a sequel to a classic at the expense of its own story which has massive holes in the plot. Visually stunning, particularly the AI girlfriend though the whole film seems obsessed with naked ladies for no good reason. The sound track is heavily based on the original but tries too hard to match Vangelis and fails, heavy handed, music overpowers speech and the sound fails to reflect the action. Story is an interesting development of the original but could easily have been told in a 2 hr film and the blatant setups of more sequels are annoying, and as for the leading man, Gosling just spends the whole film being a smug and self satisfied Ryan Gosling. I've watched the original Bladerunner countless times since it came our (last time a couple of days ago). I can't see myself bothering to watch this one ever again.",2,19,41,7 October 2017
World War Z," Why let a good book stop you making a rotten movie?
","What we have here is a pretty mediocre zombie movie in the same sort of vein as the far better Zombieland. About the only thing it has in common with the book is title. The characters are about as uninteresting as it gets and there are so many holes and hanging threads in the story you can't help worrying they are planning a sequel! They attempt serious science but it laughable, has WHO Cardiff heard of biosafety levels? Where do they get the sat phones that work inside, and why leave out what must have been a very exciting in flight refuelling to get the C130 to fly that far!Seriously, if you haven't read the book don't waste your money on a ticket to watch the film, go buy the book for a properly entertaining zombie yarn!",1,7,12,4 October 2013
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Oh dear
","Not the worst scifi sequel of the year, the new Blade Runner get thats honour, but it was close run thing, gaping plot holes, silly jokes (yes I know what the steam iron spaceship was about, pointless and childish!), ridiculous characters. Seems more is put into making millions out of the brand than delivering a sensible story. What story there was could have easily been told in 90min and giving either side some remotely competent commanders would have meant a walkover. We all know how to take out an at at but the revolution seems to have forgotten. Oh and as to the penguin things, bet Disney has made a fortune out of soft toys porgs.",3,1,2,28 December 2017
