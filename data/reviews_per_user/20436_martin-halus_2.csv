Source Code," one more with AN IDEA
","A good idea is sometimes more than all the special effects worth millions of dollars. Believe it or not, sometimes an idea happens in Hollywood, too. And what makes this flick above average is just the idea.Source code reminds me of the Phone Booth with Colin Farrell back from 2002. Simple idea, not too long, good acting and it all makes sense together. In this case, Colter is a dead soldier whose brain is kept alive to participate in a military program. The program, that makes possible to live over and over again somebody else's last minutes of life.Although there are several questions you might ask and you feel that it does not always seem right, don't bother to think too much and don't look for the answers. Even if you don't like sci-fi that much, I believe you will enjoy it as much as I did.",Null,0,1,13 July 2011
Taken," Good action, nice acting but...
","I have been looking for some action this month and this piece satisfied me well enough. There is a great job from the director and especially from the camera and cut although it misses some points to excellence.The main idea - retired 'James Bond' - Bryan (Liam Neeson) saving his daughter in Paris - is simple but efficient. It provides all the action we need. Liam really stands out and outdoes himself. The movie is not too long, I would say just the right time, it keeps you thrilled for the most of the scenes. He is self-confident, sure of himself and desperate to find his Kim. This is the good part - believable.On the other hand, there was time when I thought 'how the hell could this happen ?!' I mean, some facts are not so convincing. There is too much luck and accidents that favor Bryan. I just could not go with it. In the end there is a little twist, but this is not enough. Bryan always knows where to go and what to do. And if he gets caught, hanging bound waiting for execution, he escapes the death miraculously. But I guess this is just the way the movies are turned today..Despite this, I think the movie is well worth watching. Its not disgusting but of course without some corpses would be no action and no fun. Enjoy the show! :)",Null,2,4,6 November 2008
