Ford v Ferrari," Motor head or not!
","Get your popcorn ready kids, cause you're in for a ride.
It was like watching the actual 'le mans 66'i was cheering like it was a live broadcast running on tv.
bale and damon, the new dynamic duo to appear on screen,bearing crazy resemblance to their characters they exceed expectations with their acting as well.
I've done my research yes, the film is as accurate as an arrow, with a bit of sprinkles on top they made it possible.
Definitely a huge oscar contender this year with its fascinating cast and crew delivering an absolute treat for the viewers.

The King," Netflix, a usurper.
","You ask yourself, is this movie in any way different than any other modern classic?
Will it differ from its history predecessors?A Shakespearean family tragedy of war and suffering, of life and death, of goodwill and resilience.When you keep your mouth open throughout the thing, you know that there's something different, not partially but fully.Chalamet(hal) gave us his greatest performance, yet its buried underneath the piles of films hollywood produced, the great cinema, the place where people go to, you forget such gems exist!People think that when netflix produces, its an instant failure, a conspiracy that should be long forgotten.a crazy 7.3 rating that baffled my mind, how could it be? People might not share my thoughts but a collection of details proves my point.Directing, camera work and cinematography, acting, colors and editing, set design, a score composition that grips your heart and mind instantly, but thats not all.An uncanny battle that puts the likes of game of thrones to shame, your heart starts beating fast, no control over your breath, you start contemplating whether you should be fighting along side the king or not!How oh how is this movie not well recognized, i have been watching so many movies lately and I haven't felt such an urge to rewatch it seconds after it finished.ALL HAIL THE KING!",10,4,6,24 March 2020
Joker," Thank you todd phillips.
","Its very hard to analyze whats going on in this movie, or maybe my head is flooding with words i cant write, since i was a kid i have always been a fan of dc and joker
Seeing him in batman the animated series(1992) or tim burtons take on the character or even reading comics that involved him made me realize not only how complex this particular character is but also how he can be written in so many different ways.
Today im 22 years old, i walked into the theatre thinking that the hype might be coming from fans missing the joker on screen, but hold on a minute, todd wrote and joaquin delivered!.
Legendary performance, great writing, moving score, great use of color pallets and a mesmerizing study/deep look on both the joker and society, thats not all, expressing to you how the joker made me feel throughout the movie is a hard thing to do, so i leave the rest to you.

Wonder Woman," Ooooof, where do i start.
","A perfect combination of bad cg and lazy writing gets you bad acting by gal, still not sure how this movie has better ratings than man of steel, a movie that came out in 2013 surpasses this one undoubtedly.
Sat through the whole thing wondering where all the love for this movie came from,other than pine's acting this movie isn't as great as people say!",5,0,3,23 September 2018
Incredibles 2," Waited 14 years and got what i wanted
","Pretty amazing how an animation sequel surpasses its predecessor, comedy,animation and action-wise, incredibles 2 packs the movie with beautifully-made action sequences and great dialogue that hooks you instantly from the first minutes, with its funny,humorous well-written script, it delivers the highly-waited incredibles sequel we all longed for",9,4,9,22 June 2018
