The Ring," 'The Ring', amazing and scary.
","This movie moved me so much... you wouldn't believe. I took a pillow with me to the theaters, but i used it only twice. All the other times I used it nothing happened. Throughout the movie, the suspense and sense of death was carried by the characters. Everything seemed so real, so scary that in a time in the beginning I was screaming and crying and laughing and I said to my sister and my friend that I want to get out. When I go to sleep now I always think there is a dead body in the closet, and that the house I live in is haunted. I think I could die in seven days, and I obviously wanna see now The Ring 2. If you like horror movies, or just wanna have a good time with your friends, then this excellent movie is for you!!!!",9,0,1,26 August 2005
