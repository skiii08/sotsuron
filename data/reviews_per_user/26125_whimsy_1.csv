Minority Report," Worst in recent memory
","Bar none, the worst movie I have seen in recent memory. Grossly unrealistic, even for a movie set in the future. Why do these computer interfaces all involve waving your hands around? Pseudoscience abounds. The plot is tenuous at best, but I didn't give it much of a chance to get all the loose ends tied up - I left midway through the chase. That's how bad it is. For reference, the last movie I walked out of was Chain Reaction.",1,5,10,24 June 2002
