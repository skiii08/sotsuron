The Ring," 'Ringu' Rules
","I've avoided seeing this Americanized 'product' of the original Japanese classic up until now and for good reason, as I've discovered.There's nary a scare in it.America, as it had done with so many great overseas properties, just waddles along and sits on them, remaking them in replicant form and throwing in big star names for credibility and to push box office.The exteriors in this one are somewhat atmospheric but apart from that, it's pretty stale and Samara, when she finally appears, looks more like your cranky, white trash neighbour than anything sinister or foreboding.Definitely for the easily pleased or those not even aware that Ringu exists or is the definitive, original version.",4,1,2,12 November 2019
Green Room," Dumb Show Favourite
","The shills must have been paid well to promote and hype this limping excuse for a movie.Filmed exclusively in state of the art P.B.S. (Pitch Black Syndrome), I read about where there were some major intense scenes and gore in this movie but who would have known...? You know that The Ain't Rights are a real legit punk rock band because they wear Minor Threat and Dead Kennedy's T-Shirts but they're just as dopey and harmless as The Mutants from San Francisco once were.Patrick Stewart barely registers.Pat (Yelchin) with half his arm sawn off barely registers pain but has a romantic interlude with a new, disease infested punk rock girl of his dreams, whilst contemplating the universe and some curious paintball memoirs.A small, runtish dog seems to have wandered onto the set by accident.No adrenaline rush from this turkey, just a migraine more likely, from squinting into the darkness trying to decipher who's doing what to whom.If you can't waste enough time watching this, you're not trying hard enough....",2,2,4,15 November 2019
Green Room," I've Got A Splitting Hedachi...
","The shills did a great job hyping this semi-mediocre piece of garbage - they must have been well paid.All filmed in the best tradition of state of the art P.B.S.(Pitch Black Syndrome),you can close your eyes and you won't miss a thing.Apparently there was some first rate gore for the hounds and anyone breeding vampires but who would have known..? The members of the 'Ain't Rights' wear Minor Threat and Dead Kennedy's T-shirts just so we know they're real legit punk rockers but they're all as dopey and harmless as the Mutants from San Francisco once were.Patrick Stewart doesn't register.Pat (Yelchin) with half his arm sawn off by now, feels no pain but instead gets a romantic interlude with the new, disease infested punk rock girl of his dreams, whilst contemplating the universe and curious paintball memoirs.Another small runtish dog seems to have wandered onto the set by accident.Its all yet another over-hyped crashing bore, designed for high adrenaline thrills but more likely to provide migraines from squinting through the darkness to try and decipher who is doing what to whom.I really wish this fake, dishonest brand of movie making would stay in the can where it belongs.Someone in a review somewhere made favourable comparisons of Green Room to Romero's Night Of The Living Dead.How low can you go..?",2,2,4,15 November 2019
The Babadook," Can We Forget About This Film Already..?
","Don't think me unpatriotic or unsupportive, being Australian, but I consider this way overrated piece of drivel to be one of this country's poorest films.I wish I'd made it though myself, for purely financial concerns but then I probably would have spent the rest of my life playing it down for artistic integrity. On an international level, it's like the general populace had been warned that they would all rot in Hell if they ever dared to dislike this film.Almost 'everyone' loves this miserable tale of a dreary modern day harridan going to pieces and taking it out on her poor defenseless child - (drumroll...enter the Babadook). It's like someone hitting you on the back of the head going 'Isn't this priceless'?- 'So freaky and scary'. Get over it.If you want to see a true Australian masterwork of startling effect, then try Walkabout, Wake In Fright or Between Wars and bury this overpraised piece of piffle once and for all.",1,3,9,12 November 2019
Us," ...ridiculous
","Ironically, this tepid little film has it's own doppelganger all it's own.There's the film that's all shrouded in heresay and media hype, courtesy of a one-hit director and then the actual shoddy film you get to watch once you've payed your money.Summed up - a new found capitalist making a film that rails against the evils and injustice of capitalism and corporate ID as a big 'message statement film'.Whilst collecting the rewards of course.Peele's doppelangers are neither scary or with any real redeeming social comment.They're just cartoon nasties wallowing around in near pitch darkness, (as has been the excruciating 'cop out' trend of the horror/suspense genre for the last 15 years or more).Comedy is spliced in between the mortal terror of this film to cover it's bases, since there's nil tenson or a decent scare in it.Without these interjections of jive humour, the whole flimsy thing would undoubtedly sink like a lead balloon.Cypress Hill and other like acts on the soundtrack, ranting on just like Santa's baddest elves also are used to depressing effect to prop up one's 'social conscience'.This film is not the one you 'only 'think' you've been hearing and reading about - it's merely just another fake, selfish Hollywood cash-cow.",2,1,2,1 August 2019
Life of Pi," Richard Parker Drops Dead
","I hated this movie. Pretentious, smug and ever pleased with itself, it actually made the cliche of 'asking for a refund' when it was over a realistic and rightful option.Woeful stereotyping of the main character if memory serves along with huge helpings of completely absurdist Fantasia style elements made for a truly pathetic viewing experience.A cutesy-fool movie for the budding middle class philistine...",1,2,4,9 December 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," History Re-written
","There is much to love about Tarantino's sprawling 60s tribute, the style, the flourishes, the homages and the wonderful spiky humour.It's confidence in itself propels it along and despite its lapses in what one may consider plot devices and storytelling, any more criticism aimed at it would have to be considered nit picking by any half formed cineophile.While the chaotic finale transfers it's allegiance to wish fulfillment from the Nazi enclave to the infected hippies of the era and once again registers familiar shades from a previous work, the film however is so immensely watchable that it's hard to deny the director his preferred prognosis of events.The performers are all a joy to behold and identification is solid throughout for denizens of the era, resulting in that rare example of filmmaking whereby at the end, one feels and recognises the compulsion of wanting to visit it one again in the short term.",7,0,1,6 January 2020
The Evil Dead," Join us
","What a pleasure it is to revisit Raimi's classic time and time again and never tire of it. Hard to believe 39 years has passed since The Evil Dead splattered it's way onto our screens and into our existence but this fact only reinforces it's tenure now as a modern 'classic' of horror cinema, even though it was ahead of its time back in 1981. It cost supposedly $50K to make and yet what they achieved with that paltry sum is indeed astonishing.They, for the most part didn't put a foot wrong. From the swirling fog and mist, to Cheryl's leafy assault and pursuit amongst the undergrowth, Linda's hilarious demise, the surreal excursion into the basement and of course the landmark final tracking shot - a movie of this flaming originality and departure only comes along perhaps once a decade. The Evil Dead stood in for the 80's, Blair Witch for the 90's and after that, I can't really think of the next entry ( there has been admittedly kind of a drought for awhile). Like your worst dream as a ten year old, The Evil Dead resurrects itself in real time as the everloving fun-house nightmare you cannot escape.",8,0,0,12 June 2020
Silence," Phone Call From God...
","Mmm..here's one that's difficult to evaluate and offer a polished critique of. Perhaps it's best just to say whether one just enjoyed the film for 'what it was' and whether or not it moved you in some way, rather than getting into...well, you know. I personally don't think Scorsese has made a 'bad' film, not the ones that I've seen anyway, with the exception of Gangs Of New York and that's only because I've never seen it. Never did and still doesn't appeal to me.For the time being anyway.
However, I liked Silence a lot, although by its end, I had the feeling it isnt saying anything we all didn't already 'know'. Still, it was a project the man had envisioned for many years, so we should respect him and the film for that.",7,1,1,17 November 2019
Reservoir Dogs," Huh...?
","Dont get me wrong, I like this film as much as anyone else, always have, but my question is this.Why in God's name does Mr Orange admit to Mr White that he is in fact a cop when his fellow reinforcements are virtually outside the door and thus his final reprieve would have been assured.....is there something I missed or overlooked?",7,0,0,21 September 2019
"Sal√≤, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," In Remembrance My Handsome Stranger
","When this film was finally able to be seen in a strictly limited release in Sydney at The Academy Twin Cinemas in Paddington (ah, memories), I made probably one of the worst decisions I ever made, in a long line of worst decisions ever made, mind you, to take a date with me to see it. Already a half established cinephile myself by that time, I knew everything one needed to know about it, its reputation, its maker and the supposed purpose it's maker intended. Blah blah. My date however had no such prior warning and as such, 'Gremlins' being probably the most mischievious and outrageous celluloid outing in his recent memory, I realized afterwards my choice of movie for the occasion was utterly inappropriate and irresponsible of me. Oh well. I vaguely remember his face as just a blank canvas, with his jaw hanging open for most of it and I can't remember if I apologized afterwards or not. If not for anything else, he inadvertently saw a landmark piece of cinema that he otherwise never would have. I'm not going to wax on about this movie however as it would just become more words, another opinion, more boredom concerning a film that will polarize people's worldviews until the next ice age anyway or worse case scenario. I can only say I enjoyed the film despite its queasy excesses and applauded its formalist muck rucking filth. This angry and passionate man had something to say and this is how he expressed it, in his chosen art form. His reasons and anger for me was infectious, hilarious and identifiable, even given the huge cultural, political and personal gulfs that would undoubtedly exist between myself and it's maker. I still look for ways in that I should label his film as exploitative, misled or pretentious but I'm afraid I cannot locate them. I think with a back catalogue of some of the most stunning films that I ever had to fortune to grow up on, it seems strange or more likely improbable that Pasolini would have waited for that long in his career just for the opportunity to make a disreputable or dishonest film. No way. I salute this filmmaker . A good man, who died for his art and perhaps for who he was as well.A consumate artist who just didn't have enough middle fingers during the the creation and making of this, his final film. God bless him. (!)",8,0,1,23 January 2020
It Chapter Two," Caught In Flux...
","Make no mistake despite the mixed reviews, this is an outstanding sequel, even superior to that of it's predecessor. There are so many wonderful touches installed in this film, the humanity, the giddy humour and the persuasive melancholy of who we are and our place in the world. There isn't a false note. Of course all the horror and insane creepiness is all still intact, bigger and bolder than before, some of the set pieces are inspiring. Yet even so, all this seems to take a backseat to what else is being conveyed here at times, in which the assembled cast admirably manage to put across. It could almost be considered an entrant for the Cinema Of Personal Expression in a minor way and in modern terms.Yes the French kissing CGI ghoul was slightly stretching the boundaries but apart from that everything looked and felt right in so far as the cruel, fun-house effect that the film strove for. It didn't reach perfection but I believe it achieved everything one could have hoped for in terms of a companion piece to the 2017 film. It's almost a shame that it's all ended but a grand exit in my opinion.",8,1,1,28 December 2019
The Silence of the Lambs," Gimme Gimme Shock Treatment..
","Watching The Silence Of The Lambs again some 30 years later, you come to realize it's greatest strength being, is that it is an 'actors piece'. This is what raises the picture up to it's still seminal and legendary status today, whilst the background story, events and supporting cast can seem slightly dated and diluted, due to the sheer number and diabolical content offered by thrillers since its inception.Both lead performers have weathered and survived the years immaculately however and is primarily the root source of why this film still holds up as strongly as it does.Both are exquisite in their creation and to watch.The haunted house finale is a bit wobbly and unreasonable even back in 1990 but probably not enough reason to carp.I don't think, in regards it's honouring, the Academy sweeps the thriller/horror genre under the rug in so far as accolade, more like a case being that films of undeniable excellence such as The Exorcist and this one are just so few and far between.",7,0,0,10 January 2020
