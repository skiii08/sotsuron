Kill Bill: Vol. 2," It was a total DULL disappointment - spectacularly un-clever
","This movie was 95% talk and 5% action. I wouldn't have minded it so much if the talking was stimulating, but it wasn't. There was one scene where Bill was talking about super heroes and their alter egos. I about puked. Kill Bill One was good. I saw it twice in the theater. I will never see this movie again. It was a total disappointment! After the set up of volume 1, this dull and spectacularly un-clever `sequel' just whimpers home.  It tries to inject depth to the one dimensional killers of volume 1 but fails miserably.  Even the introduction of a child into the mix fails to resonate any real emotion.  This could be the worst film released this year.  I agree, if anyone but Tarantino had his name attached to it, critics would be bashing this thing without mercy.",Null,8,16,2 May 2004
Iron Man 3," The Best #3 film of all-time. Long live the new champion of the number THREE!
","Well, it's happened again for the armored Avenger. It's no wonder that everyone is again praising Iron Man in some way. Iron Man 3 is a best comic adaptation worthy to follow the greatness known as The Avengers. The original Iron Man may have surpassed every original installment of any superhero film to date. The sequel advanced the character of Tony Stark while setting up Avengers quite nicely. Iron Man 3 goes beyond even that and when you start at the remarkably high level that the first film achieved, that's saying something. It manages to deliver everything with the same style and integrity of the first film but adds more intensity, drama and action. Again, like the original, Iron Man 3 is a film everyone can enjoy because it cares enough to deliver excellence on every front. The remarkable cast more than delivers and Cheadle's Rhodey was certainly an upgrade over his role in the second film. The story itself is told in a masterful, crisp manner featuring the great dialogue that we all now expect from Marvel films. It's witty and uses the perfect use of humor yet again although this is by far the darkest film in the trilogy. The plot features advancement and complex characterization all the way through. Add the huge comic book style scenes and slugfests that were lacking from the first and you have what ten years from now people will be calling the best number three movie ever made. Yes, better than Return of the King. This is truly movie-making of the highest order and it easily deserves all the praise it has generated from both fans and critics alike.",Null,0,6,30 April 2013
The Girl Next Door," ridiculous tease movie
","What horrible d-tease movie. With very few sexy moments and absolutely no nudity, what was the point of this film? where they trying to preach `sex is ok' to teens without showing any? have you ever seen a porn star that hot? usually, they're just skanks with ridiculous boob jobs. speaking of ridiculous, this movie is just that. What was this movie trying to be? sexual? Inspirational? All it ended up being was annoying.  Again...What horrible d-tease movie.

Spider-Man 2," Absolutely an incredible experience ... A+++++
","Spiderman 2 is not just a good comic book movie. Spiderman 2 is a great movie period. Rarely have I gone through such a range of emotions during a film, I mean this is Spiderman not some movie you'd expect such depth from. Absolutely an incredible experience that everybody should be a part of.Spider-Man 2 is simply one amazing film. The complexity, depth, heart and action were off the charts.  I honestly can't remember when I saw a better movie. I totally agree with film critic Roger Ebert when he calls this movie the best comic adaptation film of all-time. I echo the high praise his partner Richard Roeper and just about every other critic in the world has given this instant classicthumbs WAY up from me too! I was stunned by how many times I was actually moved emotionally by the film's plot. I know many movies claim to have something for everyone but this one manages to pull it off while remaining interesting and compelling all the way through.  There are spectacular action scenes as well as heartfelt family moments.  There is romance and there is humor.  I can't imagine anyone age 8 through 65 not enjoying some aspect of this film. Director Sam Raimi, the cast/crew and writers should all be proud of this masterpiece and take a bow.  The only remotely negative thing I have to say about this movie is how can they possibly top it? Also, after giving us something this good, how can I wait years to see the story continue?!? I can't wait! I also can't wait to see Spider-Man 2 again, and again, and again",Null,0,0,1 July 2004
Troy," AWFUL - a pretentious waste of time
","Another example of how a big studio prostitutes a story to make it likable to a wide audience, miserably failing in the attempt. It aspires to be much more than what it actually is, almost to the point of being pretentious. Only Eric Bana's performance merits recognition and the storyline deviates too much from the original to be taken seriously. Since when do I go to movies to see 'what might have really happened'? Lacked proper character identification, much less development; managed to make a 10 year stalemated siege look like 2 months; completely ignored the role of the immortals (except for making some of the characters look deluded); contains 1-lukewarm love story that is supposed to cause this whole event and 1-ridiculously pointless extraneous love story (ps-if this is what really happened, she would only be a trophy); battle scenes were so shaky it was nauseating. This is just the short list. On the whole, lacked epic feel--should have stayed home and watched Braveheart and Gladiator.",Null,0,4,23 May 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," Why is Death Fun? Mess of a Movie
",If you want to see a movie where literally millions die but a handful survive (fortunately a hotdog stealing homeless man and his dog are two of them) then this movie is for you.  (Spoilers).................  This movie depicts people dying in weather related accidents left and right.  Were we suppose to think seeing newscasters killed by giant tornadoes in Los Angeles were funny somehow? Why did Quaid's character have to hike to New York? He wanted to be with his son but all I could think of when the helicopters arrived to pick them up was that he needless killed his best friend on his pointless hike.  He could have just choppered in and looked for his son with the rescue parties. This movie is typical summer mindless action but I don't find millions dying such a fun summer topic.,Null,0,1,30 May 2004
Spider-Man 3," Incredible Experience & a GREAT film!
","What I said about Spider-Man 2 holds true for this movie. In fact, it took everything good about the second and added more action and excitement.Spider-Man 3 is not just a good comic book movie. It's a great movie period. Rarely have I gone through such a range of emotions during a film (not since SM2 anyway). Absolutely an incredible experience that everybody should be a part of and everybody should rush to see.The complexity, depth, heart and action were off the charts. I honestly can't remember when I saw a better movie. I totally agree with the film critic who said it's the best of the three movies due to the added complexities in its storytelling and the evolution and growth of the characters as a whole since the first movie. I was stunned that SM3 is actually an improvement on what was essentially a classic. I know many movies claim to have something for everyone but this one manages to pull it off while remaining interesting and compelling all the way through. There are spectacular action scenes as well as heartfelt family moments. There is romance and there is humor. I can't imagine anyone at any age not enjoying some aspect of this film.Director Sam Raimi, the cast, the crew and writers should all be proud of this masterpiece and take a bow. The only remotely negative thing I have to say about this movie is how can they possibly top it now? Then again, I said that after Spider-Man 2 so who knows? Bring on Spider-Man 4!",Null,10,44,3 May 2007
Van Helsing," HUGE Disappointment - WAY over the top & VERY Dumb
","This movie was EXACTLY like watching a two-hour video game.  How old was the person that wrote this script?  I know you don't go to this type of film looking for a deep plot or even a believable story but you at least expect coherent entertainment. From the opening fight scene with Mr. Hyde through the end of the film, there wasn't one single moment when you bought in to the CGI chaos that was depicted on the screen.  When severely underdeveloped characters are flying around and defying every law of physics, you're never allowed to get involved in the movie on any level other then the `cool cartoon' level (and quite frankly very few of the jerky CGI cartoon creature scenes were that cool).  I could literally list the WAY over the top, unbelievable cartoon moments but that would fill up an entire page. The sad part is that most of the CGI monsters looked really fake. From Hyde to the baby vampires to the vampire women, they all looked extremely cheesy. Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale are exceptional actors but were so stranded by this script and by the stunts that it almost hurt to watch them floundering on screen from one fake backdrop to another.  The hambone that played Dracula threw so much over the top cheese at EVERY single line he delivered that my arteries hardened just watching him.  To call this film a disappointment would be an understatement.  I was greatly looking forward to it because of the concept, the cast and the obviously huge budget.  It's such a shame that they threw this much talent and this much money behind a script written by someone's pre-teen child.  I guess I should be asking myself why would I expect anything remotely intelligent from a movie that was directed by the director of The Mummy & Mummy Returns?  I'd say next time I'll know better but there won't be a next time for me sitting through any more of this guy's movies.",Null,1,1,7 May 2004
Van Helsing," Scariest thing about 'Van Helsing'? Watching it!!
","HORRIBLE. It was actually more fun LAUGHING at the stupid plot turns, events and Kate's awful Transylvanian accent. I love Hugh Jackman, and very disappointed he chose to make such a ridiculous movie. Maybe 3 year olds might like it.This was not even a movie. It was a group of people in the CGI department getting their rocks off. I can't imagine a movie that could possible be worse in every way (except visually). The writing was beyond stale, the direction was so over-the-top I thought the movie was a parody of an action movie. STAY AWAY! Go see something else, go see anything else, or stay home and watch paint dry. It would be vastly more entertaining.",Null,0,1,23 May 2004
Hellboy," TERRIBLE (w/ SPOILERS)
","Hellboy did have its fun moments but it just seemed too over the top for my tastes. It featured too many cheesy moments that ruined the feel of the film. There was also an underlying frustration factor present as the movie unfolded. I don't think the director was aware of this mounting viewer frustration but he re-enforced it with practically every scene.  The good guys were buying the farm at every turn.  From the beginning with the Nazi slice and dice to the museum guard massacre to agent after agent of the bureau being slaughtered to innocent guards and bystanders dying to poppa Hellboy through the end, I hate the overwhelming supernatural enemy that can't be killed but takes out good guy after good guy.  It's one thing to establish a horrific and formidable villain but it's another to frustrate the viewer.  This movie had more of the flavor of an idiotic Freddy Kruger movie instead of the feel of a good comic/action film. It seemed more interested in making the audience delight in the way people were killed instead of portraying the actions of the lead hero.  When the agent with Hellboy that had the talking half corpse on his back was killed by the giant hammer/pendulum fell to his death, did anyone laugh at that subtitle? This director missed the mark by being all over the place in terms of style and he seems to be too warped to notice.  The ending also seemed so very anti-climatic. Spoilers ......................... ...................................................... ........................ ................. The mastermind of all this carnage has a giant squid jump out of him and gets squashed by it off camera??? What??? An interesting effort but this film is ultimately a failure because the plot couldn't keep up with the CGI. (PS-By the way, after killing every agent in sight, why keep the useless agent Myers alive and poorly chained?)",Null,8,12,10 April 2004
Prisoners," Superb Performances. Intense To The Max!
","This is one intense and drawn out film, maybe too much so. I wonder if this movie really had to be over two hours long? It felt even longer but not always in a tedious way. The subject matter is extremely heavy and morose and there is no break for the viewer right through the conclusion. (BTW- the ending elicited many gasps, muttering and even consternation from the crowd I saw it with.) The performances really are superbly intense, believable and even award worthy. There are a few scenes where you really feel emotional pain ooze from the screen. Maria Bello, Viola Davis, Terrence Howard and especially Hugh Jackman each give us at least one scene that breaks the heart. It's powerful, intense acting at its most emotional peak. Despite the great performances however, this really is a one and done film for me. I recommend it but I can't say I'd ever want to see or experience it ever again.",Null,5,9,20 September 2013
Logan," Just A Flat Out MASTERPIECE!
","Holy Cow! We've finally got the Wolverine movie we've all been waiting for and then some! Mr. Mangold has nailed the character and the action, and Hugh Jackman is truly a part of a Wolverine movie that has showcased the true character that the fans had hoped to see full on. Yes, we've seen superb runs and flashes but nothing this deep or this epic.How could any movie fan in general not just adore this film? It brought elements of a lot of great genres. Logan has to be considered genre-defining. The characters, action and story were all beyond outstanding in this movie. We are taken for a ride and can relate to Logan once again. The acting is superb and the dialogue is perfect for the level of each character. Every single character feels believable. You follow the story through Logan's eyes and what a ride it turns out to be. This movie is emotional and moving in every single way that matters and is unique and is as far away from anything X-Men we've seen before. In this case, that's a very good thing. The fight scenes and pace are superb. I honestly could see Oscar nominations here on multiple fronts.This movie is sophisticated and delivers a grand, tragic story. The action fits in nice but serves the story first. Unlike other 'dark' films, the tone is perfect and fits the character. The supporting characters are utilized in a comprehensive and cohesive manner and are wonderful in and of themselves. I loved everything about this movie and they left it as if this was the perfect end to Hugh's run.",Null,337,646,18 February 2017
Big Fish," Disturbingly BAD ... Overrated as it gets & Dumb as it gets
","Why would that idiot even tell stories that are so odd that no one in their right mind would believe them?  They're not particularly clever or eccentric enough to captivate anyone.  We, the viewer, were even treated to them visually and that just added to their deplorably foolish nature.  I was not captivated or enchanted by even one of these tall tales. This film reminded me of that classic TV moment on the `Simpsons' where homer remarked to Marge about having to pay for concessions he had pilfered after a school drama production `I had to see Krabopple's butt, believe me I paid for it!' Well, I should have looted my theatre's concessions after this flop because I had to see Danny Devito's butt.",Null,10,27,23 May 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," VERY Overrated - Bizarre But Shallow
","Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind wants to be a bittersweet comedy about erotic loss and memory loss. But it doesn't have the heart or brain. It does have an idea with so many clever compartments that audiences can unload their emotional baggage into it. And that may be enough to make it a critical hit but it will just tank at the box office. Without more depth and inspiration, all this cleverness ultimately goes down the drain. Critics are determined to give this film a high grade because they want to seem clever but the fact is that this film is just a strange mess and nothing deep at all.  Bizarre for bizarre sake because you really don't care about either one of these strange characters.",Null,19,45,10 April 2004
Man on Fire," Awful In Every Way - The Director Should Be Banned
","After the girl's abduction, this movie takes a left turn and just goes right down the tubes. I spent the rest of the movie either annoyed or disgusted by the irritating decisions the direct made.  His presentation was awful to the point of nausea. The horrible ending just drove home the point that this is not the way I wanted to spend a couple of hours on a weekend. Any message that the film attempts to convey is sunk by its mediocre storytelling and overall bizarre quality. If you absolutely have to see it, don't expect it to be as good as the trailers would lead you to believe. It starts ok but it's one big let down after that.  As for the co-stars, Walken only gets about eight lines in this whole movie and the plot is terrible.",Null,6,17,2 May 2004
The Terminal," Very Disappointing
","Tom Hanks, not the problem. The supporting cast, not the problem. I hated the ending, our Hero deserved better. And our Lady in distress, I never thought for a minute she would leave her lover for our Hero. That is where this movie messed up the ending.  It was like watching fireworks shoot into the sky with no bursts of brilliant color. Very disappointing. Director Steven Spielberg is far too interested in walking the line between cute and believable. Victor is basically a human E.T., and we're supposed to laugh as he seems all too happy to be stuck in the airport doing funny stuff, like make cracker sandwiches with ketchup and mustard and make small talk with an INS agent so that he can pass on information to her love-smitten would-be suitor Enrique in exchange for dinner. In other words: 'Do tricks for food.' I didn't think Spielberg could sink this low.",Null,1,3,26 June 2004
The Wolverine," Met and then exceeded all expectations! Great film.
","The Wolverine is exceptional in every way. It's an awesome action flick that totally surpasses its predecessors. It ultimately stays true to its comic-book roots while finding a unique and believable pivot point for an outstanding film all on its own. Take out all the action and you'd still have an entertaining character drama. That says a ton.It's not just that this movie is more character driven yet still delivers thrilling action sequences, though that's true. Rather, it's that there's a whole story here. The Wolverine starts with the perfect pace and springboards in to aspects of the classic Miller/Claremont Marvel Comics mini-series in breath-taking ways. It's a multi-faceted tale with an emotional richness seldom associated with films in this genre. Too much of 2013 has given us good reason to equate summer movies with empty, flash-bang exercises in computer-generated imagery and mindless action. But the writers here are as interested in the subtext as they are in the high quality action. There's no denying that mutant powers are a tool but it's the character depth that really drives this film. They use state-of-the-art special effects to deliver a live-action version of the comic books. What fans already know, however, is that vintage Marvel books are classics because of intelligent writing as much as comic book flare and fantasy. The movie delivers tremendous story and skillfully weaves together character, plot and action. It's just plain spectacular on any level that you judge it.",Null,3,8,27 July 2013
X2: X-Men United," X-Ceptional Film In Every Way!
","In terms of high adventure, this is 'The Man Who Would Be King'. The acting is superb. The dialogue is rich. Every character feels believable. No cartoonish villains, every side of the issue is presented by people who believe they are the ones who are in the right, and honestly fell that way. This movie delivers on its characters, and the action scenes are there only to advance plot and build character, and that's the best kind of action sequences. This movie redefines comic book genre. It restores the sense of epic adventure and grand-scale storytelling that's been absent from far too many of today's alleged blockbusters. I swear, if this movie wasn't based on a comic book it would've been one of those adventures that would've received considered for the Oscars back when the Academy still cared about films in general, not just the ones with the best campaigns.",Null,0,0,10 April 2004
Sin City," ignorantly overwhelmed and exacted by the violence
","I'm not a big fan of the gangster film genre. Especially not this one. Some comic books were just meant to be comic books, and not transferred into film. All this film is about is corrupt people with the urge to kill each other in the most violent ways possible, sometimes by just being sick individuals or for revenge. A lot of people go to see this movie and think they are cool and tough but the're really just ignorantly overwhelmed and intoxicated by the violence and whoring that consistently makes this a bad view that you can live without seeing. The acting is mediocre and nothing special, and the only thing I remember after the movie is not the acting, story, or even the 'black and white representation of a comic book' style. The only thing I remember is an ugly pot-bellied rapist getting his reproductive organs ripped from his crotch and then getting his head literally smashed into a flattened pulp by Bruce Willis. This is cool if your a young guy and very stupid, but if your a mature and intelligent person it will just anger you that people are actually stupid enough to enjoy this crap.",Null,10,21,3 April 2005
Coach Carter," Please do not support this embarrassment to Sam Jackson.
","I went into this movie with low expectations, and unfortunately the movie did not even meet these standards. There were at least 3 lines in the movie that were said at least 5 times, such as 'i make my players maintain a 2.3 gpa because...blah blah blah'. the movie had absolutely no character development, and the only character that did get developed ended up getting aborted. this pro-abortion, everything is whitey's fault movie had me looking at my cell phone every five minutes, anticipating the ending.

Dodgeball," Dodgeball is simply awful, like everything Stiller has been in since The Royal Tenenbaums,
","The movie's go-to gag consists of people getting smashed in the groin or the face with a red rubber ball. This gets old after the first dozen times or so. Anyone with a sizable role in Dodgeball gets mired in the script's dissipated tone. Two of the climactic jokes involve Happy Days references. How tenuous is that? BEN Stiller's overbearing schtick officially reaches its expiration date with the desperate and puerile 'Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story.' There are  a few scattered laughs to be found amid the sports-underdog treacle and crass body-fluid gags that constitute this, the fourth Stiller comedy of the year (so far) - but the diminutive actor's cartoonish mugging is responsible for exactly none of them. This movie reeks of desperation from the start, resorting way too often to the 'Funniest Home Videos'-style spectacle of people getting hit in the crotch with red rubber balls.
