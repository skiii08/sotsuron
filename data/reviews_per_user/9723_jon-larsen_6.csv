Requiem for a Dream," Hollywood at its best!!!!!
","Ellen Burstyn blew me away in this film! This is her best role so far!This movie is about four drug addicts. They all have dreams, but as dependence on drugs is increasing, their dreams are turning into nightmares.The acting is phenomenal. The story and how Aronofsky tells the story is just fantastic! The music is extraordinary. The cinematography is amazing! The directing is great. I also love how Aronofsky expresses his feelings without words and body language but with camera!I've almost seen a thousand of movies and no movie has ever affected me like this one! Even though this movie is amazing, I warn you: This movie will haunt you for several days!Mr.Aronofsky has done a great job, if you feel sick,depressed or got the feeling that you're not going to touch drugs, after you've seen this movie! The movie is very brutal,tragic and honest. I hope you stay off drugs after you've seen this!This is a cinematic masterpiece and a fantastic work of art! 10/10",10,29,47,7 January 2010
Snatch," My stomach hurts! It literally hurts!
","Last year I was working on the IMDb Top 250 list, and I noticed that Snatch was on the list, so I decided to take a look at it. I was in Denmark at that time. I live in Faroe Islands.I stayed at my uncle's apartment, and he told me that you have to watch some of Guy Ritchie's movies before watching Snatch to get to know his movies better, so I watched Revolver. I was not very keen on it and then I was not looking forward to see Snatch.While my uncle was not at home, I decided to watch it. I wanted to turn it off after the first second, because I thought it was so weird. I'm 14 years old now, and I knew almost nothing about cinema back then, and I had never seen such a movie like Snatch, and it's style! I thought it would be stupid of me to turn it off after 1 second so I kinda forced myself to watch it. To be honest, I actually loved the weird style after 10 minutes!The cinematography was great. I had never seen something like that before and the editing was just as great too. There were lots of great characters and the script was excellent. It was funny and clever and it will you make you laugh every single second! This movie is like Pulp Fiction. You can almost quote every line! The acting was totally awesome! Jason Statham, Vinnie Jones and the rest were great, but Brad Pitt totally stole the show!I was thinking to myself 'This movie can't be any better!', but then it got better! Brad Pitt showed up! His accent got me laughing all the time! My stomach hurt, it literally hurt, and I got many bruises on my thighs because I could not stop hitting myself from laughing!This was one of the few movies that I didn't want to end, so I decided to watch it again the next day and the next day after that.I have seen a lot of movies in my life, but there are few movies that are better than this one! It's definitely in my top 15 of all time.It truly deserves a 10/10",10,31,46,14 December 2010
American History X," American History X
","Film Review American History X is about a skinhead called Derek Vinyard. He brutally kills two black guys and goes to prison for only three years. His brother, Danny, who worships Derek, was the only one who saw him kill those guys, but he didn't testify. In prison he slowly befriends a black guy. This black guy, Lamont, tells Derek that he went for prison for 6 years because he stole a television and accidentally dropped it on the foot of a police officer. Derek realizes that black people and all the foreigners are not treated fairly. He also realizes that what he has been doing is completely wrong. After three years when he's released, he notices that his little brother, Danny, is following his footsteps. Derek teaches him a life lesson and tells him that he's choosing the wrong path in life. This is an amazing film. The director, the cinematographers and actors did an amazing job. I thought it was a fantastic idea to shoot the film in color and black and white. When you shoot films in color it's to get a more natural image of life and black and white is to express the realism in films. That's mostly used in documentaries and films that are based on real life. Although, back in the very old days, almost every film were filmed in black and white. I also loved the idea of filming the flashbacks in black and white, because Derek regrets his past and the color white symbolizes innocence, which I assume is not the right symbolism in this case, but it does symbolize for some common sense, although black symbolizes something more depressing like death, grief and melancholy.That's not the main reasons why I love this film. The main reason why I loved the film is the story and the message. The film does an amazing job to show what's right and wrong and the way it builds up to the message is just genius. It's a story of hope and even people who have so much hate in their minds can be flipped. This is a film that everyone must watch and I hope it touches everyone who watches this film just as much as me, and I hope they learn a lesson for life.I have seen many films in my life but there are not many films that touches me so deeply like this film. It's one of the best film I have ever seen in my life. 10/10",10,0,1,6 October 2011
Twilight," On my bottom 5!
","This movie is simply awful! I don't hate it because it's a chick flick. I hate it because the acting was so awful, i just wanted to scream at the television!The story was so incredibly bad! There is no character's development, and the characters are so bad! This movie is a disgrace for vampires!Are vampires vegetarian? Do vampires go out while it's sun outside? Are they supposed to sparkle? Are vampires supposed to be driving and wearing sunglasses? No, they're are not supposed to drive and vampires do not wear sunglasses, because they're not supposed to be outside on a sunny day! Do vampires eat animal blood instead of human blood? And do they have souls? NO!!I gave this movie 1/10 because I enjoyed the cinematography!This movie is a great example of a bad movie!",1,114,351,24 April 2010
It's a Wonderful Life," One of the greatest movie ever made in cinema history!!
","When I heard about this movie for the first time, I thought it was just a forgettable and funny movie. But I was wrong. I saw this movie last Christmas and I did not find it funny, but I loved it, though! Everything is so great in this movie. The story is amazing. The characters are great, and the character's development is fantastic! the cinematography is grea, and the acting is fantastic. James Stewart was mind blowing. The whole movie is amazing,touching and encouraging. You cannot describe how good this movie is. Nor can you describe how good the message is.This is the best feel-good movie ever. It's a life changing movie, actually. It makes you feel good to be alive. Do me a favor and watch this movie as soon as possible! When you're sad, think about the message this movie delivers, because you will get a smile on your face! I'm 14 years old. My English is not very good, but I hope this review was useful!",10,119,131,14 March 2010
Mary and Max," Masterpiece!
","To say it short, this movie is about a friendless 8 year old girl in Australia who befriends an obese 44 year old male in New York by writing mails to each other.I'm not a big animation fan, so I wasn't looking forward to see this movie. I am currently working on the IMDb Top 250 list and Mary and Max just entered the IMDb top 250, so I took a look at it.I watched it with a small screen on my computer while chatting with someone on Facebook. But then I logged out because I got hooked by the fantastic but sad narration mixed with humor by Barry Humphries, so I watched it with a big screen. Thank God that I did that, because this is an unforgettable and heartbreaking cinematic experience! It got fantastic narration and dialogue that will make you laugh and cry!PS.There are many scenes that will choke you up, so bring some tissues.PSS.Don't watch this movie with your kids!I hope this review was useful!",9,54,61,31 October 2010
