Ford v Ferrari," Bale's outstanding portrayal
","If you're not a car/racing nut, don't be put off by the title. Even though the storyline is about the real life battle between the two car giants, the best thing about this film is Damon's and Bale's on-screen friendship, the cherry on the cake being Christian Bales portrayal of Ken Miles. I couldn't stop watching this film and everytime I grinned from ear to ear. I'm glad I saved it for watching during the Covid lockdown.",9,4,4,24 April 2020
