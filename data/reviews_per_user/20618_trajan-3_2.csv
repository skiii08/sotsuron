The Sound of Music," Glorious
","How sad to read negative posts about this film. Sad to think that some people cannot release themselves into the sheer joy of this exhilarating musical, perhaps the best film musical ever. The backdrops are gorgeous, the songs without parallel, the story supports the music, and Julie (Maria)and the Captain fall in love. This movie takes me back to my childhood but I also love it as an adult. Julie Andrews is luminescent and the Captain well played by Plummer. May this movie live ten thousand years!",10,1,7,27 December 2000
Dumb and Dumber," gag!
","This movie is horribly made, badly scripted, boring and an insult to anyone's intelligence. The sophomoric humor is one thing; I like a good pratfall as much as the next person, maybe more. Here unfunny gags are repeated over and over and over. Why do the 2 stars trek off from Rhode Island toward the west? To chase some woman. How silly and pathetic. Typical Hollywood: druling ugly guy(s) wind up with bombshell dame.",1,27,71,27 December 2000
