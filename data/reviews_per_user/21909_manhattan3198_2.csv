",THIS IS THE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME BECAUSE IT'S THE MOST ORIGINAL IDEA FOR ANY MOVIE OF ALL TIME IN THE HISTORY OF MOVIE MAKING. NO OTHER MOVIE EVER HAS COME UP WITH A MORE ORIGINAL IDEA AND IT'S THE BEST COMEDY CAST EVER PUT TOGETHER IN ONE MOVIE. MOST ORIGINAL IDEA FOR A MOVIE OF ALL TIME. IT WILL ALWAYS BE A NY CITY MOVIE AND THE HEART OF NY CITY. IT WILL ONLY BE A MOVIE FOR KIDS WHO GREW UP IN THE 1980'S. GOD BLESS HAROLD RAMIS. IT'S ALSO THE BEST AND MOST REMEMBERED MOVIE OF ALL TIME FROM THE 1980'S. NO OTHER MOVIE VEVER HAS COME UP WITH A MORE ORIGINAL IDEA THEN THE CONCEPT OF THE IDEA OF FOUR GHOSTBUSTERS. THIS MOVIE IS A PERFECT COMBINATION OF EVERY MOVIE GENRE PUT TOGETHER TO FORM ONE COMPLETE MOVIE. YOU GONN CALL. YEA IT WHAT OTHER MOVIE IS A CHARACTER AS BIG OR MOST REMEMBERED OF ALL TIME THEN THE MARSHMALLOW MAN.,10,3,4,21 September 2018
