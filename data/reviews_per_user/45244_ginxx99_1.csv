Sucker Punch," Don't miss the sublime
","****SPOILER****It appears that the Director has you all fooled... Get your mind off the scantly dressed girls and pay attention. Two words: MULTIPLE PERSONALITIES... think about it, watch it a few times, then decide what's real and what's not.P.S. If you still don't get it do the following: 1) go look up anima (spirit guide) or Carl Jung 2) look at what made her sink into delusion and who got killed, then who was the next to get killed. Make the connection? I'll give you a hint little sister then older sister... oh and 'tell mom I said I love her' 3) people didn't get lobotomy for nothing! I don't care how bad the asylum, she/them had issues to work out.4) LASTLY, Who's story is it?!? Hmmmm....who narrates it.",10,4,9,27 March 2011
