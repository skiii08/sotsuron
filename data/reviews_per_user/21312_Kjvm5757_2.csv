The Equalizer," Absolutely Amazing
",Every minute of this action packed movie is amazing. This is the single best movie I have ever seen. All of the actors do great jobs at their roles from the villains to the side characters they all give convincing performances. Denzel Washington proved that he is the best actor of all time with his great performance in this masterpiece. The plot makes sense and is not contrived at all. There are no loose strings or plot holes making this movie very well thought out. The music in this movie is some of the best i have ever heard. I will definitely be purchasing the soundtrack if one is ever made for this movie. The movie does a great job of making all of the characters seem important to the audience and has Denzel feel like the greatest vigilante of all time. You must see this movie as soon as possible. Everything about this movie is great. Overall the best movie of 2014 and possibly the best movie of all time.,10,5,17,5 October 2014
22 Jump Street," Worst movie i have ever seen.
",Absolutely atrocious. The jokes are terrible the characters have ABSOLUTELY NO DEVELOPMENT the humor is non existent ALL of the character are unlikeable bickering idiots (not even funny ones) the slapstick is overdone and (once again) unfunny. I only laughed because of how bad this movie is and when people in the audience went home HALFWAY THROUGH THE MOVIE. If you have not seen this movie I envy you. Then they have two cringe worthy fight scenes that were THE WORST I HAVE EVER SEEN. There is almost NO ACTION. The CLIMAX OF THE MOVIE WAS SPOILED IN THE FIRST TRAILER FOR THIS MOVIE WTF!!! And of course this movie treats the audience like morons by explaining every single reference and running gag from the other movie. Channing Tatum is an egotistical unfunny Mary-Sue who never once fails at by his own means while the fat one just fails at everything possible (just like this movie). I have absolutely no idea who any of the characters are because they aren't memorable and are AS BLAND AS WHITE RICE.,1,7,17,13 September 2014
