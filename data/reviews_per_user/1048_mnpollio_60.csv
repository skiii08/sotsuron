The Blair Witch Project," A triumph of marketing genius over substance or style
","More than 10 years after its premiere and many who watch this film may well wonder what in the world the hubbub was about. The truth is that the marketing campaign for the film is a far more interesting topic than anything that appears in the film itself (more on that later). A relatively simple tale of three amateur documentary filmmakers who vanish into the Maryland woods while investigating the title phenomena is the center of this film. The amateur nature of the film-making in that everything we see is fairly badly shot through a jittery hand-held camcorder is supposed to add authenticity and accentuate the 'you are there' atmosphere of the unknown a la Romero's Night of the Living Dead. Unfortunately, a glaring discrepancy is that Romero's film actually had a solid premise to hang its low-budget authenticity on and the Blair Witch Project has nothing of the kind. The opening moments which introduce us to three characters, played by Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams, are dreadfully uninteresting and fail to do much to ingratiate the leads, other than to emphasize that Donahue is a type-A control freak who micromanages the entire foray into the woods badly. If anyone can figure out what the 'legend' is that is supposed to be so fascinating to inspire a documentary and propel this story forward, they are doing better than I. The mishmash of background provided by snippets of interviews with locals indicate that the legend may or may not have something to do with a witch, a ghost and/or an old male psycho who kidnaps people - the entire explanation is murky at best, which is a fatal flaw since we have no idea what exactly these people are searching for. While there would be some suspense to be mined from easily losing one's way in the wilderness, that quickly dissipates thanks to the ill-tempered characters basically shouting and cursing at other with dialog that is rather painfully made up on the fly. The supernatural elements are total misfires due to two issues: 1) for much of the time, when the characters claim to hear something ominous in the nighttime forest, the audio is so bad that we often cannot hear the same things, and 2) the reactions to the most minor of events are so hysterical as to induce unintentional laughter (ie., someone sees a pile of sticks in the forest, which results in screaming and running). Of the actors, Leonard makes little impact in his limited screen time, Donahue is shrill and annoying, and Williams hints that he might have been able to do something worthwhile within a better structured film. By the end, few if anyone will know what, why, where, how or who The Blair Witch is. It is truly a shame that some of the savvy poured into the marketing did not wend its way into the film. Over-hyped as the little film that came out of no where, such a claim was near laughable since the internet had been abuzz for months before its release laying the ground work for the film and deliberately confusing easily credulous viewers that it was true and what they were seeing was actually a video found abandoned in the woods rather than actors playing a badly written plot. Coupled with a front page Time Magazine article, ready-to-be-duped patrons flocked in droves to see the true story of the poor young victims obliterated by the supernatural, only to subsequently be disappointed in that they were conned and the production they were conned into seeing was a badly filmed, motion sickness inducing, amateurishly acted mess. Don't believe me? Seriously, try to find anyone in the physical world (not in the anonymity of the internet) who will actually admit to having been terrified or even marginally entertained by this film. It takes a really long search. And in the age of similarly filmed efforts like Cloverfield or Paranormal Activity, Blair Witch's fading star gets less notable with each passing year.",3,1,2,9 May 2010
Alien 3," An abomination of near-epic proportions
","One would love to have heard the story planning sessions for this abysmal third film that pretty much put the final nail in the series coffin before a lackluster attempt to revive it with another ill-fated fourth film. Ridley Scott's original was a simple And Then There Were None haunted house feature set in outer space, but filled with jaw-dropping class and style that made it stand out from the pack of a number of worthless imitators. James Cameron's sequel was a virtual text book on how a sequel should be made in that it upped the ante both action-wise and emotionally by expanding the Sigourney Weaver character, getting the audience firmly on her side and giving her a compelling relationship with a daughter figure. If the first film was an homage to a haunted house film, then the sequel is a rip-roaring homage to war films.By contrast, it is difficult to figure what the goal of David Fincher's atrocious sequel is aiming for. It does not up the ante action-wise nor does it expand the characters from the prior films. In fact, Fincher's audience-hating mess offs two of the major characters from the prior film in the opening moments and sidelines another - apparently because of lack of imagination. We then discover relatively early in the proceedings that the leading lady is living on borrowed time, which all but eliminates any rooting interest in the film. While creatively Fincher has license to eliminate audience favorites from the prior films, he cannot jettison them with so little respect and then not replace them with characters at least as interesting without it seeming like a slap in the face, but that is exactly what he does. The denizens of the prison asteroid where the doomed heroine and her ill-fated crew crash in the opening moments is populated by an interchangeable melange of nobodies who blur together.The storyline, such as it is, conspires a dubious and illogical scenario of how an alien could have accompanied our heroine and then propagated itself on the asteroid. Rather than an army of aliens (a la Cameron), Fincher ratchets it back so far that we instead get one modest-sized alien that is far less intriguing or frightening than the one found in Ridley Scott's original. Action-wise we get badly directed, murky-looking scenes of frantic bald men running down hallways. The alien moves at the speed of sound (almost like a Benny Hill sped-up sketch) so that it would be impossible to elude it, yet a number of characters illogically seem able to outrun it.Fincher makes it clear from the start that he is far less interested in action or character development, but merely wishes to hang his own bizarre stabs at style onto an unwieldy framework - and stylistically he is no Ridley Scott or even a James Cameron. Why Weaver, who no doubt could have negotiated for a better story, would have returned and participated in this pap is indefensible. Even worse, why 20th Century Fox did not just end a promising sci-fi saga on a brilliant note and instead chose to have it interred and vivisected by hacks is equally unknowable. As it is, we have the perfect example of Class 101 on how NOT to make a sequel in a successful franchise.",1,968,1146,11 April 2007
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A less than auspicious start to the new trilogy
","After a 16 year lull, George Lucas steps back into the director's chair to provide us with the long-awaited Chapter I of the Star Wars saga. Perhaps no film could have met the expectations of delirious fans long-starved for another trip to a galaxy far, far away, but it would have been nice if Lucas had tried. Going back to view the original Star Wars, one must still be impressed that its simple good vs. evil storyline structure holds up and is enhanced by the incredibly personal flourishes – from the sets, the visuals, the rich intergalactic canvas that Lucas weaved showing an amazing array of alien beings, the background that Lucas allows each character/species, the wry sense of humor, the nice balancing of game newcomers with old pros. Unfortunately, in the interim, Lucas appears to have mistaken simplistic for simple. The Phantom Menace comes off as a Spongebob Squarepants rendition of a Star Wars film in both intellect and imagination as it pitches itself to easily impressionable 2-year-olds in the room. The storyline somehow manages to be needlessly cluttered, not well thought out and almost laughably pointless all at the same time. It comes across as something still in the development stage and given that it took Lucas 16 years to cough this up – it seems even more tragic. Opening with some incomprehensible drivel about trade agreements – the viewer is never clear on how important any of this is. The opening dialog would not have made the cut on an old Space 1999 episode and the editing is woefully inept. Watching actors like Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor, both far better elsewhere, interact with tacky looking CGI effects and pretend that they are at risk from a gaggle of obscenely incompetent aliens and robots, all of whom speak pidgin English and are about as menacing as the buffoons from a Marx Brothers comedy is a real low point. Much ink has been spilled lambasting the inclusion of an alien – Jar Jar Binks – whose ineptitude and Amos & Andy borderline stereotype delivery seemed to take the brunt of the criticism for the film. Yet say what you will, at least the character has a strongly discernible personality – something all of the other characters grossly lack. After rescuing Queen Amidala – the woman who will become mother of Luke and Leia – Neeson and McGregor are waylaid on the desert planet Tatooine – a place not especially interesting in the first trilogy and even less so this time around. This allows us to be introduced to the young Anakin Skywalker – later to be Darth Vader – and the plot to laboriously hook him up with his future. The film does have its moments – notably a mid-film desert race riff on the Ben-Hur chariot race that would have been infinitely more effective had it ended earlier – but oddly none of the sequences reach any memorable impact akin to any lesser scene from the original trilogy. Lucas seems far more obsessed with CGI visuals that lack both the believability and punch of effects from 20 years ago than he does with such things as depth, pace and suspense. Neeson acquits himself well as the wise Jedi master, but that pretty much ends the quality acting. Someone forgot to write McGregor a part in this film as he basically stands around looking on. Natalie Portman is lovely, but spends huge chunks of the film speaking in a monotone from behind kabuki make-up and bulky costumes that make her appear a cross between a pagoda and a Chinese New Year dragon. Pernilla August is positively catatonic as Anakin's mother – causing her throwaway revelation of a virgin birth to be near laughable. The less said about Jake Lloyd as Anakin, the better. There is no subtlety or shading to his performance – he comes across as some cross between an over-caffeinated Little Rascal and a mannequin, and screeches the film to a halt every time his character is required to conduct himself in a way beyond his years. Samuel L. Jackson stands out like a sore thumb trotting out his tiresome tough guy riff as Jedi Mace Windu. Beloved droids R2-D2 and C-3PO from the original trilogy are reduced to mere cameos here, as is Yoda, who becomes increasingly underwhelming with each appearance. The film also lacks a strong villain – a problem not solved with Ray Park's all-too-brief appearance as Darth Maul, who turns out to be a rather disappointing character despite his intimidating appearance. A less than auspicious start to the new trilogy.",4,3,6,28 July 2009
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The pinnacle of adventure films
","I must say that I cannot find anything to carp about with this thoroughly entertaining and rousing adventure flick which pays loving homage to the cliffhanger serial of yesteryear, while elevating the entire genre to a whole new level of sophistication.The plot sets daring archaeologist Indiana Jones (the superb, indispensable Harrison Ford) off on a rip-roaring adventure to locate the fabled Ark of the Covenant. The villains are no less than the Nazis, led by smarmy rival archaeologist Paul Freeman and slimy Peter Lorre look-a-like Gestapo agent Ronald Lacey. Assisting the hero are past and current love Marion Ravenwood (a terrific Karen Allen) and Sallah (John Rhys-Davies).The film boasts stellar special effects that are used in the service of a literate, intelligently written storyline. The dialog is believable and the relationships amongst the characters are fascinating. The film has terrific atmosphere and flawless direction from Steven Spielberg, who really hit all the right notes in showing the kind of expertise that could be brought to popcorn films. The action set pieces are all splendid and suspenseful. Ford and Allen share a terrific chemistry. In fact, so strong is the relationship between their characters that the follow-ups have suffered a bit from the absence of the Allen character - a flaw that Spielberg and company seem unwilling to correct even in the newly announced forthcoming venture. The film has terrific villains and builds to a breathtaking climax with a healthy dose of cynicism thrown in at the end.A truly superb film that is usually to be found on the lists of the greatest films of all time and at the top of the greatest adventure films ever.",10,2,4,29 April 2007
The Big Lebowski," Indefensible garbage
","I have been a fan of a number of efforts from the Coen Brothers. Truthfully, even when they miss the mark, I am still able to find something worthwhile in the effort. The Big Lebowski is the exception to that rule. I originally saw it in theaters, where it played for an eyeblink and received mixed reviews. It was one of the few films my family has ever walked out on. I caught it later on cable and watched it to the end to see if I missed anything worthwhile, since it had inexplicably developed a cult following. The answer was a resounding no.In what can complimentary be deemed a plot, the action centers on a zoned out bowler nicknamed The Dude, who somehow is mistaken for the title billionaire and gets pulled into what must be the most ill-conceived kidnapping plot in the history of cinema.The ludicrous nature of the action would seem to recommend it to comedy, but the film is devoid of laughs. Unless the idea of a young woman's body parts being sent via mail is especially funny to you. The film introduces one needless and ostentatiously bizarre character after another in order to drum up some semblance of entertainment, but since none of them are important to the 'plot' and have nothing of comical worth to contribute, it all seems a huge waste.The dialogue is basically thinking up new ways to drop the f-bomb every 10 seconds. What passes for comedy is having the avuncular narrator (Sam Elliott) actually stop the proceedings at the midway point to good-naturedly ask The Dude why he has to to use such chronic foul language, to which The Dude responds with another f-bomb. How meta! How coy! And to rouse viewers lulled into a stupor, there are occasionally pointless unrelated fantasy sequences.Julianne Moore shows up to no avail, speaking in some wacko old-Hollywood actress rhythm (think Jennifer Jason Leigh in The Hudsucker Proxy). But whereas Leigh's impersonation had a legitimate reason to be, Moore's quite simply does not. Jeff Bridges can be an amazing actor and has contributed some wonderful cinematic contributions. This is not one of them. It seems incomprehensible that a following has cropped up around this character, because The Dude is little more than a cipher. The Dude is a completely passive non-entity, who spends the duration in a zoned out state. He seems to have nary an opinion on anything and it is inconceivable that anyone could mistake him for the title character, much less a sentient being at all. The plot careens him from one improbable and unfunny set-up to another eliciting little in the way of energy or emotion from him. He is just not remotely interesting here.The only appealing or likable characters in the film are Elliott's narrator and Steve Buscemi, as a perpetually sunny and helpful fellow bowler. Alas, Buscemi is basically here to be bullied, brutalized, cursed at, and finally die. If most of the cast is awash in unlikable and appalling characters, the worst by far is John Goodman. The normally reliable Goodman is so over-the-top that his every moment on screen is like fingernails down a chalkboard. He plays The Dude's 'best friend', a completely incompetent bully who inserts himself into everything to the detriment of all involved. He drops the f-bomb as much as The Dude and treats everyone around him with loud-mouthed contempt. He is an illiterate, detestable, brutish bore and the performance desecrates the screen, yet the filmmakers actually seem to think his antics are a riot. The film is pretty awful without Goodman's godawful work, but with his participation it descends even further into cinematic hell.I cannot think of anything to say complimentary about the film and the fact that this abomination was vomited forth by otherwise talented filmmakers seems inexcusable.",1,15,30,27 January 2017
Citizen Kane," Years after the controversy, the film fails to stand on its own merits
","It is virtually impossible to come across a 10 Best Films List from any 'serious' critic or film institution that does not have Citizen Kane ensconced in the Number 1 slot. I have literally heard film historians who insist that if you don't like this film, then you don't like films. Well, I happen to love films and I do not especially like Citizen Kane and, refreshingly, I see from many of the comments there are legions of people that also do not appear to like this film much either. Much of the aggrandizement stems from the high esteem that the film industry and critics held auteur Orson Welles and the empathy they had for Welles in the obstacles that he faced in making this film. Yet while one can appreciate the single-minded ferocity an artist can have in bringing forth a vision – one must also admit that many times the end product of that vision is not a masterpiece. Welles' melodrama, which is a thinly veiled depiction of the life of legendary power broker William Randolph Hearst, put him on the wrong side of the publishing magnate, who did not like having his life be the subject of a film and set forth the dogs of war to try to hamper Welles. Many critics gathered around Welles and starting inventing superlatives to describe the end result as an antidote. At the time, this picture caused quite the controversy and became a cause célèbre. Unfortunately, decades after the death of Hearst, when many new film watchers barely know who he was, the film must be judged on its own merits and not the controversy it caused in its day, and that is where the film falls apart.The film opens with the death of its central character, the obscenely wealthy Charles Foster Kane (played by Welles) and his whispered dying word of 'Rosebud'. A group of journalists go on the hunt to figure out the meaning of what or who is 'Rosebud', and we get to see Kane's life unfold in retrospect based on the investigations of journalist Joseph Cotton. 'Rosebud' is the film's central mystery, but it is basically a McGuffin. People going into the film familiar with the answer will find the proceedings utterly pointless. Those unfamiliar with the identity of 'Rosebud' may be less charitable once they realize that they have been gamed into hanging on for something so trivial. In fact, it is almost laughable as to how slight the storyline ends up being.Welles depicts everything on screen at arm's length. There is no character to draw the viewer into the events that unfold or to win sympathy. They are all just ciphers moving in and out of the frames. Emotionally, the film is positively glacial. The acting, even by Welles himself, is outrageously stiff. Events befall the central character and have minimal impact and thus the viewer has absolutely no reason to be impressed by them. Fans of the film drone on and on about 'shots' and camera effects as though great film's succeed on those merits at the expense of story, acting, style and substance. Welles, the director, overuses the canard of mammoth Gothic sets that dwarf his characters to emphasize their purported loneliness or disenfranchisement. This may have been impressive at the time, but now it merely seems a ploy to compensate for the tepid dialog and stale performances. Anyone who truly wants to give director James Cameron grief about his dialog really needs to go back and listen to Citizen Kane with an unbiased ear. Additionally, the much lauded darkness of the film and trick camera shots that earned Welles praise for his cinematic decisions become far less impressive when one realizes that Welles directed and photographed ALL of his films in this fashion, whether it was warranted (Journey Into Fear) or not (The Magnificent Ambersons). It was simply his directorial style and he offered no other alternatives in his career because it was all he knew how to do. Unlike other films of the era which are still impressive, even if we don't like their point of view (Gone With the Wind comes to mind), it is difficult to even understand how Citizen Kane rated as a great film in its day. Its central character remains aloof and the grand secret of Rosebud leaves most viewers I know shrugging their shoulders, if not lamenting the loss of time it took to find out about it. The revelation, rather than arousing sympathy or understanding for Kane, fails to make him any more accessible and, like the camera work, ends up coming off as a last-minute gimmick to try to make Kane the man seem more human than we have witnessed in compensation for the lack of development during the course of the film due to the weaknesses of the writing and acting.And finally, for those film historians/critics who are still thumping their chests 70 years after the fact as to how the Oscar voters gave the Best Picture to How Green Was My Valley over Citizen Kane, the answer is quite obvious to someone watching the films with fresh eyes. HGWMV may have its share of downbeat moments and may not be 'perfection', but it contains in its running time more emotion, character development and solid storytelling than Citizen Kane is able to muster on its best day. It is far and away the more accessible film for viewers emotionally - then and now.",4,7,14,18 March 2011
Inglourious Basterds," Two-thirds brilliant - one-third rubbish
","While not a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino and his often ADHD film epics, I do have some appreciation of his talents. So despite the fact that the previews for this film literally made me cringe, I decided to give it a shot and was pleasantly surprised. The film opens in Nazi-occupied France in one of the most tense and perfectly acted openings I can remember set in a farm house harboring Jewish refugees beneath its floorboards and a rather intimidating interrogation between the farmer and charming/threatening SS officer Christoph Waltz. Unfortunately, the action then switches to the Inglorious Basterds of the title and the writing/directing suddenly seems to have been taken over by a rather immature and volatile 10-year-old. The action shifts yet again to a cinema in France operated by a young woman who escaped in the opening passage and who is now masquerading as a Gentile. The woman - played beautifully by Melanie Laurent - finds herself thrust into the spotlight as she has become the unwilling object of affection of good-natured young Nazi war hero Daniel Bruhl and the Nazi powers-that-be have decided that her theater should host the premiere of a new propaganda film based on Bruhl's exploits, which will attract the Nazi hierarchy, and brings her under the scrutiny of Waltz again. Thankfully, this plot thread becomes the main one with the 'Inglorious Basterds' taking a back seat. I say thankfully because something becomes glaringly clear early on. Every time the film focuses on the German, French or British characters, everything seems to flow with intelligence and suspense. When the film shifts to the American characters it turns into amateur night in Dixie with the writing and acting. Something even more notable when Brad Pitt and company have to interact with the international cast. Never have I seen a more glaring discrepancy in acting prowess than watching the American actors flounder opposite the European cast. While I am not a WW2 scholar, I am familiar enough with it to note that I have never heard of any U.S. forces conducting themselves with the bloodthirsty savagery of the title team during that campaign. Their cause and patriotism seem oddly irrelevant to them so long as they can maim and murder with abandon - which makes them not so much better than the Nazis they abhor. Indeed Pitt seems more than willing to torture allies for his jollies. The overly bloody sequences of them scalping people and disfiguring them with near psychotic glee seem to belong in a completely different film and mar much of Tarantino's otherwise amazing accomplishments here. Tarantino provides some truly terrific passages - including a lengthy mid-film sequence where British officer Michael Fassbender and one of the Basterds try to pass themselves off as Nazi officers in order to meet at a bar with glamorous double-agent Diane Kruger and chance makes it spin completely out of control. Acting-wise the international cast belts it out of the park leaving the American actors looking like hacks. Waltz is nothing short of astounding as the brutal and competent Hans Landa and he easily steals every scene he is in truly earning his Oscar. The case can also be made for wondering why neither Laurent or Kruger were not seriously considered for a nomination. In a film with so few appealing characters, Laurent woos the audience over to her side and makes her ultimate attempt at revenge one to savor. For the majority of the film, Bruhl is appealing and sympathetic as the lovestruck Nazi war hero. So much so that Tarantino must suddenly make him behave completely out of character from anything witnessed previously in the conclusion to excuse executing him without compunction. August Diehl and Gedeon Burkhard make strong impressions as well during the extended sequence at the bar, as does British actor Fassbender. Of the Basterds, German Til Schweiger comes off the most convincing. Eli Roth and B.J. Novak are just plain embarrassing, while Brad Pitt swaggers through the film in a laughably caricaturish performance sporting a ludicrous corn-pone accent with a grimace tattooed on his face that makes him appear to be smelling something rotten (perhaps his performance?). And Tarantino should also note that having every other character die in a bloody hail of bullets can become old and disheartening after a while. Yet despite the lousy writing for the Basterds segments and the dreadful American performances, Inglorious Basterds is well worth watching and remembering for terrific plotting for the majority of the film and the high quality of acting from the European cast. Truth be told, even with its weaknesses this, Avatar, Up in the Air and Precious are all substantially better films than The Hurt Locker, which topped them all at the Oscars.",7,0,4,9 April 2010
Alien: Resurrection," Beating the dead horse
","If Alien was a sophisticated sci-fi thriller set in outer space, Aliens was a virtual textbook on the correct way to make a sequel and Alien 3 was a wall-to-wall catastrophe that put the nail in the coffin of a stellar series, then Alien: Resurrection is little more than a cheap attempt to wring one more round of cash from a once durable tentpole. After the disastrous third entry, it was difficult to see where this film could go or why enduring leading lady Sigourney Weaver would want to go there with it.A couple of hundred years after the last debacle, the Company has once again launched an effort to clone the aliens and also end up with a bizarre hybrid of Ellen Ripley (Weaver) who also shares alien DNA. During a visit by a group of mercenaries, all hell breaks loose with the aliens going on the rampage and the mercenaries forced into a prickly trust with the hybrid Weaver to escape with their lives intact.On the plus side, while practically nothing works in this sequel, it still manages to surpass the wet fart of Alien 3. Although it would have been in her best interest to take a powder after the prior film, one still has to hand some credit to Weaver for still managing to find new facets to play in a role that should have been played out. The problem here is that Ripley has always been an audience favorite and too much time is spent with the viewer wondering how far this latest incarnation can be trusted. This is a bit sad since this film desperately needs some rooting interest.The screenplay feels like it is at least four drafts from being completed. It is a veritable skeleton, which barely gets its sketchy characters into position before starting the pursuit. It never gives a compelling reason why the Company maintains its compulsion to exploit the aliens, much less why they want a clone of Ripley hanging around. The new characters are without exception badly written and underdeveloped, which means the only way of having any impact is by shamelessly overacting. Ron Perlman, Dominique Pinon, J.E. Freeman and Brad Dourif indulge in laughably hammy over-the-top performances that make them memorable, but not in a good way. Michael Wincott, as the leader of the mercenaries, is barely introduced before being discarded and Dan Hedaya is simply dreadful as the leader of the military contingent on site. Apparently remembering that James Cameron had much success introducing a mother/daughter relationship in Aliens, the filmmakers here try a clumsy stab at the same thing between Weaver and series newcomer Winona Ryder. Unfortunately, the film offers no time for such trivialities like character development, and the dialog is groan-worthy. Ryder spends her time on screen looking ill-at-ease, miscast and fails to find any sort of camaraderie with Weaver, rendering the mentor/student relationship that the film half-heartedly introduces utterly pointless.Director Jeunot's direction reminds one uncomfortably of David Fincher's previous effort, but without some of the ponderousness. The visuals and special effects are merely adequate, trodding ground that the prior entries have done better. Worst of all, this film squanders the opportunity presented by the return of the alien queen by rendering her harmless in favor of an ill-conceived alien/human hybrid that makes an appearance in the final stage of the film. This proves to be one of the most misguided developments because this new creature seems to look upon Weaver at its mother and astonishingly manages the feat of being the only character in the film to elicit any sympathy. The final moments where it is betrayed by its 'mother' and its all-too-realistic shrieks of agony and looks of uncomprehending betrayal during its uncomfortably protracted death scene serve to emphasize that none of the 'human' characters that one has wasted an hour or so with previously were remotely as believable or worth their screen time.If one could only scour one's mind of Alien 3 and now this entry (to say nothing of the Alien vs. Predator foolishness), the world would indeed be a better place.",4,1,2,13 April 2011
The Hunger Games," Plodding adaptation of a great bestseller
","Suzanne Collins' novel was a deserved bestseller because it was fast-paced and intelligent with a strong heroine at its core. Which is why it is so disappointing that the most accurate description of the film version is plodding.Set in a repressive future, where twelve progressively poorer districts pay penance to a rich capital city by way of a lottery that forces a male and female teenage recruit from each district to participate in The Hunger Games, a yearly televised gladiator style competition played until only one survivor is left standing. When her innocent and vulnerable 12-year-old sister is selected against all odds, the resourceful Katniss Everdeen volunteers to take her place, and along with the male offering, Peeta, is whisked away to be trained for the deadly games.The film is largely faithful to the novel, but feels compelled to tone certain aspects down to its detriment and add things that are unnecessary. Director Gary Ross provides by-the-numbers direction that is far more dull than inspired. His visions of this world are disappointing. The dirt poor District 12 looks like a set for denizens of Deliverance, except that Katniss, her sister and her friend Gale are entirely too well scrubbed for such a place. By contrast, the capital city and its citizens seem like they were snatched from one of the cheesier episodes of 1960s Star Trek.The set up of the lottery, the trip to the city and the training seems to go on forever. Ross and company provide some very badly done flashbacks to fill in gaps in the narrative. For instance, Katniss is conflicted that Peeta has been chosen since he risked the wrath of his tyrant mother and showed her a kindness when her family was starving. The book told us in a couple of paragraphs. The film requires no less than three flashbacks so vague that those unfamiliar may think Peeta is being mean to her in them by throwing food to pigs.Once the action moves to the Games, it doesn't get any better. The use of music (which can enhance suspense) is severely limited and Ross films the action with one of those jitter-cams, which often makes it near impossible to fathom what is going on. Worse, any time we start to become involved in the action in the forest, Ross and company segue to an added sequence featuring Donald Sutherland's icy president or Wes Bentley's calculating gamesmaster (a character not in the novel) or some other lackluster diversion.The casting which sounds great on paper, turns out to be a mixed bag. Sutherland dusts off his glare as the predominant villain. Bentley is fine, but his role is excess baggage. Woody Harrelson is a great choice to play a former winner who functions as an adviser/agent to the the two main characters, but the script has reigned in or eliminated some of his best moments. Elizabeth Banks is little more than a buffoon as the ludicrous Effie Trinkett, while Lenny Kravitz manages to be sympathetic as a kind stylist.In the core role, Jennifer Lawrence seemed to be a real coup for Katniss. Unfortunately, she comes off like a more mundane Helen Hunt. Katniss should be appealing and dynamic. On paper, she popped. On film, not so much. Part of the problem is that Katniss is conflicted about a number of things and Lawrence has confused conflicted with ambivalence. Instead of filling the gaps destined to happen in a film transfer, Lawrence keeps both the other characters and the viewer at arm's length. We believe she is tough and resourceful and can do miracles with a bow, but she is so aloof for the most part that we don't care. Instead of insight, we get far too many scenes of Lawrence either brooding or weeping as a substitute. When she develops a rapport with a young competitor, Lawrence fails to make us understand why or feel that it is anything other than a plot contrivance. We never feel any doubt in the film that she will triumph, so the film seems to be marching slowly to a preordained climax. Lawrence also shares no chemistry with co-star Josh Hutcherson, which mutes the later moments between them.It is arguably a scripting and acting fault that Hutcherson, despite lack of chemistry with Lawrence, actually emerges as more sympathetic and whose character, whose future seems much murkier, elicits more concern. Hutcherson manages to take on a more passive role, and successfully elicit the sympathy that often and puzzlingly eludes the lead. Yet if Lawrence has no chemistry with Hutcherson, she has even less with Liam Hemsworth as Gale. The film takes a character whose appearance in the novel was basically as a bookend and tries to set the ground for some kind of Twilight-lite triangle. Hemsworth is entirely too clean for District 12, generates no heat with the leading lady and has the thankless task of being reduced to either smiling or pouting - the latter of which he does not do well. Too many segues from the action to Hemsworth looking angsty to remind us that he is in the film and supposed to be of some import become annoying quickly.While not a total disaster by any means, the film truly misses the mark by a farther mile than many would have you believe. The film is neither suspenseful nor does it allow us to really get to know or root for the heroine, a character that jumped off the written page. The additions are ill-conceived and the workmanlike direction proves entirely unsuited for material that requires a surer, more inspired hand. And would someone please tell directors to stop shaking the camera all over the place in some misguided attempt to generate 'you are there' excitement...it doesn't work.",4,2,3,26 May 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Overly busy sequel with some high points
","Some people actually prefer this sequel to the original, although it is difficult to imagine why. The wedding of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann is disrupted when a bloodthirsty corporate pipsqueak demands that they locate a compass in Captain Jack Sparrow's possession which he imagines will give him domain over the seas, while Jack finds himself forced to repay a debt to the ghastly Davy Jones - captain of the infamous Flying Dutchman - lest he become the latest ghoul addition to Jones' crew. One certainly cannot accuse the plot of sitting on its laurels...and that is the problem. The plot is overly busy and laden with unnecessary exposition which slows down the pace and allows the charm and fun from the original to wane. There are definitely comic highlights - such as a couple of madcap chases. The cast members are still in top form even when the screenplay fails to support them. Depp is chronically watchable in this role and nothing can change that fact. Jack Davenport gets more notes to play this time around as down-on-his-luck Norrington and Naomie Harris is a delightful addition as the voodoo priestess Tia Dalma. Keira Knightley gets much more to do this time around and is fortunate enough to be thrown together with Depp. Orlando Bloom - who functioned as the heart of the original film - is saddled with a tiresome subplot, which finds him stuck for much of the film on the Flying Dutchman trying to 'rescue' his father, played by a shell-shocked Stellan Skarsgard. It is a subplot that we cannot get behind and fails to have much impact. Similarly, the screenplay has characters that we should support betray each other repeatedly on a dime - including a late act development which is really hard to buy. Bill Nighy is visually impressive as the squid-like Davy Jones, but neither he nor sniveling Tom Hollander as the corporate stooge resonate with the viewer as strongly as Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa. The final moments set up the next installment and offer a glimmer that it may surpass this effort.",6,0,0,28 December 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A good movie lifted to greatness by Depp
","It would seem a given that an action/adventure film based on a theme ride at Disneyland would be an underwhelming disaster. However, one would be refreshingly incorrect on that score - at least as far as this film goes. An incredibly imaginative and rousing swashbuckler directed with technical finesse by Gore Verbinski and sporting a solid screenplay. The film would have been good fun on its own merits, but it has been gifted with a tremendous lead performance by Johnny Depp as the riotous Captain Jack Sparrow - a lucky pirate rogue who manages to succeed in spite of himself. The visual effects are dazzling and the film has a spirited supporting cast. Geoffrey Rush is an intimidating villain as the cursed Captain Barbossa. Keira Knightley is enchanting as the gutsy governor's daughter and secret pirate groupie accidentally caught up in the adventure. Orlando Bloom brings much of the grave beauty of a young Douglas Fairbanks to his role as the more traditional hero and provides the film much of its heart. Yet the real reason to be amazed is Depp's incredible work. Any actor can take a great role and be good in it, but only a great actor can take an iffy role and turn it into a scene-stealing delight the way that Depp does here. This is the mark of a great actor and he should have walked off with the Oscar were Oscar voters not so overly entranced with Sean Penn's tiresome Method acting from Mystic River. If the film has any weakness, it is that it sports at least one ending too many and the pacing starts to flag slightly before the credits roll, but these seem trivial compared to the achievements.",8,0,2,28 December 2010
The English Patient," Odious tedium
","More than a decade after enduring this atrocity, I am still at a loss to determine what exactly compelled viewers (not to mention the Academy Awards) to lavish this uninspiring vapid mess with such over-the-top praise. There are so many things inherently wrong with the film that it becomes difficult to isolate which one of them is the most responsible for the film's implosion. Based on a popular novel - the reading of which would probably take less time than enduring the film - The English Patient centers on an mysterious count hideously disfigured by burns who victimizes his nurse (and the viewer) with the tale of ill-fated romance that left him physically and emotionally scarred. The film has its moments of beauty, but sweeping desert scenes are a dime a dozen in cinema and hardly earn this film's heralded descriptions of 'sweeping' 'majestic' and 'grand'. The film's two biggest problems are its length and its leads. The core story is relatively simple, but is so loaded up with pointless subplots and completely unnecessary extraneous characters that the film literally screeches to a halt shortly out of the starting gate. Willem Dafoe shows up late in the film to overact shamelessly and provide a narrative function that could just as easily have been satisfied by the nurse in a fraction of the time. Meanwhile, Colin Firth, whose character sets the film into motion as part of the central love triangle, is barely given a nod worth of screen time. Director Anthony Minghella seems to have no knowledge of the basics of pace, character development or how to emotionally involve his audience. A truly compelling romance requires that the central pairing crackle and draw the viewer into their emotions, whether the romance is illicit, young love or mature. Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott-Thomas are both singularly fine actors, but both share a similar acting style in that they are often restrained and emotionally aloof. The writing and dialog between them leaves the viewer unable to tell whether their characters are in love or merely in lust - but either way the actors generate zero chemistry between each other. Both come across as cold, selfish, uninteresting and emotionally inaccessible - leaving a glacial dead zone smack in the center of the film. To somewhat alleviate that, we get a romantic subplot between the nurse and a Sikh bomb expert that has a bit more emotion, but placing the emotional burden of the film on two supporting characters is highly unfair and completely ineffective. Juliette Binoche, as the nurse, acts pretty much like your standard super-model, leaving what little sympathy is generated to come from Naveen Andrews appealing work. By the time the film inexcusably limps towards its unforgivable third hour, most viewers will actually be rooting for the English Patient to do away with himself and regret that he had not done it a good 90 minutes earlier. Simply dreadful pretentious piffle.",2,14,26,6 December 2008
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," A big shiny package with nothing inside
","I have never read the C. S. Lewis novel from which this film originates so I am going in cold and judging the film on its own merits and have no idea how closely it adheres to its source. The film starts off quite well with a lot of potential, but somewhere along the way misses its footing and ends up delivering a rather empty viewing experience. The end result fails to achieve the emotional depth or scope of Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy (films it appears to want to emulate), the imagination of the Harry Potter films, or even the ambition of the more recent The Golden Compass. The opening is fascinating and sets the stage nicely, taking the four central characters - two brothers and two sisters - from war-torn London to a more pastoral setting. The youngest child, played by the adorable Georgie Henley, stumbles onto a wardrobe that opens into another realm filled with talking animals, ice queens and epic battles of good vs. evil. Naturally, she compels her siblings to return with her and aid the forces of good - embodied by a wise, noble lion voiced by Liam Neeson - against the forces of evil, led by Tilda Swinton's queen. Unfortunately, it is around this point that the film begins to falter and lose its initial impact. The visuals range from good to merely adequate, with the battle scenes particularly smacking of CGI phoniness. Purportedly there is some pro-Christian agenda at work in Lewis' novel, but one really has to stretch to find it in the film as it just never seems that deep - in fact, it is amazing how quickly the film evaporates from the mind after it concludes. Swinton is suitably malevolent as the queen, but despite that none of the characters ever truly seem to be at great risk from her, which results in a veritable dearth of suspense. By contrast, Neeson appears to have become entombed in the role of wise mentor and desperately needs to stretch himself. He has become a veritable cliché. James McAvoy is charming as an impish faun who befriends young Henley, but then he is off-screen for far too long. The biggest problem lies with the central characters. The film works well when the emphasis is on young Henley, who is the most appealing and accessible of the siblings. Unfortunately, the second half punts her into a supporting role in favor of Skander Keynes, as her conflicted brother and the younger of the boys. Keynes's role requires some degree of acting prowess to carry one over the contortions his character is forced to go through during the running time, but he seems to only have two reactions - very surly and slightly less surly, which confounds any evolution. The older siblings have it even rougher. Blond pretty-boy William Moseley seems on hand only to appeal to the teenyboppers in the bland hero role and the film/story never seems to know what to do with the older sister, played by Anna Popplewell, so she instead just seems...there, like a prop. And therein lies the film's problem as a whole. It ends up performing the same function as a Christmas gift box wrapped in sparkling paper that holds nothing inside. It is lovely to look at for a short time, but then one is ready to move on to something with substance.",5,3,5,9 August 2008
Us," Undeniably creepy enigma
","During a trip to a boardwalk amusement park as a child, young Adelaide Wilson wanders away from her parents and into a strange hall of mirrors where something terrified her. Years later, Adelaide is a married mother of two children and is a bit skittish when her husband wants to meet up with friends at the same beach. A string of coincidences and portents leave Adelaide more than a little uneasy. Even worse, that night back at the vacation house, the family is besieged by four malevolent doppelgangers brandishing sharp scissors who seem to want to destroy them.Anyone wondering what filmmaker Jordan Peele had up his sleeve after the success of Get Out, need wonder no more. As to whether Us equals or surpasses the earlier film, will be up to the respective viewer. That said, the film is undeniably ambitious and creepy. The film looks fantastic and has a sense of the surreal right from the start. The viewers are allowed to tap into Adelaide's unease and the film has the viewer off balance long before the unsettling action begins.The attack on the house and the dynamic between the different characters and their doubles is scary and disconcerting. Many questions abound. Are these doppelgangers only after the Wilson family or is it more widespread? What do they want? Where did they come from? Why is any of this happening? Some of the questions get answered and some remain enigmas. Undoubtedly if one dwells too much on the details about 'the tethered' and their existence, one can spot weaknesses, but Peele gives just enough detail without going overboard and allowing us to do too much questioning. Truthfully just the concept of us all having shadow beings that despise us is jarring.The film is violent without being disgusting. The attack scenes pack quite a wallop, but some of the quieter scenes can be even eerier and more disturbing. For instance, watching Elisabeth Moss's double grotesquely smiling while indulging in lip gloss while alternately threatening a woman cuffed to a bed is a bit nightmarish. As is the strange way the doubles have of speaking or communicating.Winston Duke is a lot of fun as Dad Wilson and his intimidating double. However, the film would not succeed at all if not for the amazing performance from Lupita Nyong'o as Adelaide. Essentially playing two markedly different roles, Nyong'o manages to be initially frightened and sympathetic as Adelaide before graduating to a tough and resourceful fighter determined to protect her family at all costs. As her double, Red, Nyong'o is scary as hell - speaking in some kind of combination between a hiss and a gasp. We may not be able to discern Red's ultimate plan, but she leaves us no doubt that it does not bode well for humanity and it will cause the most pain as possible. This is a really incredible performance which received raves, but was completely overlooked in awards season, which is inexcusable.While I figured out the twist involving one of the main characters before its revelation, I was in the dark for a lot of the film and I mean that in a good way. I also had the feeling that literally anything could happen to anyone, so the stakes were high. The up-in-the-air ending a la The Birds will probably not sit well with everyone and there are still questions left unanswered, but the ride is worth taking and the film should be allowed to take its place in the pantheon of terrific ambitious thrillers that seem to be cropping up with some frequency.",9,2,7,14 February 2020
The Others," Refreshingly old-fashioned, character-driven haunted house story
","Set in the isolation of the Jersey isles in the days directly following the conclusion of World War 2, Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, an upright Catholic mother coping with the absence of her husband who has yet to return from the front and the burden of raising two precocious children (Alakina Mann and James Bentley) whose deadly allergy to sunlight requires her to keep their immense home shrouded in darkness. Into their strange home arrive an eccentric trio of servants, headed by the seemingly benevolent housekeeper Mrs. Mills. Shortly thereafter, Grace finds their lives turned inside-out as it becomes increasingly apparent that they are not alone in the house and in fact may be the targets of a malevolent haunting. Alejandro Amenabar's lush haunted house story is moody, atmospheric and plays far more like a richly textured old-fashioned film from the 1940s than the garish gross-outs and rock-'em/sock-'em visuals that cater to the attention deficit audiences of today. He has been blessed with a stellar cast, spooky settings and a solid screenplay, which keep the audience guessing as to what is going on. Sharp-eyed viewers might guess some of the elements, but it is doubtful that they will guess all of them as Amenabar has a tendency to consistently provide new twists to muddy the waters. Bentley and, particularly, Mann are credible, sympathetic youngsters, who may be victims to their physical health, but are often more astute as to what may be happening than their mother. Fionnula Flanagan is an inspired choice as the motherly housekeeper, whose unflappable demeanor masks a bit of the sinister. Much of the film rests on Kidman and her interpretation of the not always likable Grace. At the start of the film, Kidman presents Grace as rigid and unwavering – a woman to whom no obstacle cannot be overcome by sheer will and a reading of scripture. She honestly seems to love her children, but seems torn between the resentment of constantly living in darkness and isolation on their behalf and embracing the inherent martyrdom of such an existence. There is a certain bit of viewer satisfaction in watching her world shaken up a bit and seeing her iron façade start to slip. Kidman does a marvelous job of walking the line between making Grace a force to be reckoned without turning her into a hateful tyrant and then slowly transitioning her into a far more complicated woman, whose emotions slowly start bubbling to the surface. I actually find this a far more difficult and intriguing performance than the one for which she would win the Oscar the following year in The Hours. A truly worthwhile and haunting film that actually grows on the viewer even moreso over time.",8,0,2,21 August 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Scattershot story elevated by Depp
","It is hard to understand what producers/writers were thinking with some of the developments in the latest entry in this series. Although the story does not seem as 'busy' as the last film, the action is still all over the map and truly hit or miss. The charm and fun of the original is nearly missing this time around. Characters are dispatched with nary a thought - including some underage characters - that casts a pall over the entire production. It takes a good while for the heroes - now led by the revived Barbossa - to travel to the netherworld to rescue Captain Jack Sparrow from 'hell' and return to challenge nemesis Davy Jones (an unrecognizable Bill Nighy in impressive squid make-up) and snide government stooge Tom Hollander for a final battle. Despite showing up late, Depp carries the film relentlessly forwards by still making Captain Jack a character that one simply MUST watch. Geoffrey Rush's return as Barbossa is more than welcome and provides a nice counterbalance to Depp. Supporting cast members are not served nearly as well as in the previous films with Jonathan Pryce, Jack Davenport, Naomie Harris, etc., getting particular short shrift. Keira Knighley's role gets magnified to outrageous proportions with each successive film - she has fairly usurped much of what could have been Orlando Bloom's role. It isn't that she is bad, but that Elizabeth Swann never seems to have the 'heart' that Will Turner brought as a central character. If Knightley is overused, then conversely Bloom should sue - because his role has become so inconsequential and ill-conceived. The film really loses something by shifting so much focus away from him. Bloom is sorely misused here. The final moments can complimentary be described as chaotic - definitely for fans of sound and fury over content and charm. While it is great to imagine that the antagonistic relationship between Sparrow and Barbossa will continue, virtually no one will be pleased with how writers have chosen to conclude the fate of Will Turner or his relationship with Elizabeth Swann. And what is with these film's penchant for having characters uncharacteristically betray each other at the drop of a hat? It does nothing but distance them from the audience.",6,0,0,28 December 2010
Alien," Stunning sci-fi classic that still terrifies
","In the future, a group of exploratory refinery workers are prematurely awakened from suspended animation to investigate what initially appears to be a distress signal emanating from an inhospitable planet. Once landed, the three crew members who investigate come across a mammoth derelict spacecraft housing leathery eggs, which spews forth a hostile alien life form that attaches itself to one the crew members. The fallen crew member is taken back to the mother ship for help and this becomes the precursor for all hell to break loose. Although by now near legendary, I will refrain from revealing more for any new viewers.There are those that dismiss this film as being a glorified big-budget retread of It! The Terror from Beyond Space, but the film is infinitely more than that. I choose to think of it more as a rendition of Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None set in outer space with a far more frightening nemesis than anything Christie imagined.A lot must be said about the style and realism of the film. I believe this may well have been the first (or at least one of the first) science fiction films where the heroes were blue-collar workers rather than the proverbial scientists. The dialog and interaction among the various crew members is believable and engaging. H.R. Giger's alien designs are much-celebrated for a reason and very few have been able to come up with something as continually shocking. The creature is seen in various stages of evolution, with each one being a repellent yet oddly hypnotic realization.Director Ridley Scott provides the tense and unrelenting atmosphere of the film. He also paces the film to perfection. It starts off slowly with a sense of creeping dread and then Scott ratchets up the suspense to a near unbearable crescendo. We are allowed to get to know each character and their quirks and share in their terror as they realize that their unwanted stowaway is a lot more dangerous and intelligent than they imagined. Scott makes effortless use of the dank dark confines of the spaceship, with its dripping water/coolant, tight spaces, oddly shaped doorways and clanking chains. It chronically seems as though something unspeakable is always on the verge of jumping out at one of the characters. Interestingly, although the film has a reputation for being violent - after the notorious 'chest-buster' scene, Scott keeps the remainder of the deaths largely offscreen.The cast fit well into their roles, with Tom Skerritt's stalwart captain and Ian Holm's icy scientist especially notable. However, acting-wise the film is deservedly known for allowing the previously unknown Sigourney Weaver to burst onto screens as the ever-resourceful, cool and intelligent Ellen Ripley. Ripley initially (and wisely) blends into the ensemble cast, but as the film progresses it becomes apparent that she will be the one to watch and will be the biggest obstacle to the alien. The fact that Weaver is also quite sympathetic and identifiable certainly helps the audience root for her.The final moments of the film are sublimely exciting. The film was followed by James Cameron's equally legendary sequel, which struck out into new territory and became a classic in its own right and also cemented Weaver as an action heroine. Then the series was vivisected by David Fincher's audience-hating vomit Alien 3 and the barely better Alien: Resurrection, before lapsing into Alien vs. Predator nonsense. However, none of those atrocities can dim the brilliance of the original Alien and its sequel Aliens.",9,0,1,18 April 2011
American Sniper," Propaganda at its most pandering
","While not a fan of Clint Eastwood's directing, it is undeniable that he reaches his full potential with American Sniper, a film based on the autobiographical novel by the late sniper, Chris Kyle, who boasts the most recorded kills of any sniper in U.S. history. That is if Eastwood's goal was to become America's answer to Leni Riefenstahl. As even her most dubious critics will admit, Riefenstahl captured some amazing images that are still remarked on to this day, but it was all done in the service of making Nazi Germany idealized. Similarly, Eastwood captures some fine technical achievements, but wants to fall back on a seriously laughable claim that his film is 'not political'.I have actually read Kyle's book and for a film that is 'not political' it works overtime to provide Kyle with introspection, personality, insights and philosophies that are no where to be found in his novel. Eastwood has the Kyle of the film raised with a nonsense philosophy of the world being comprised of sheep, wolves and shepherds (ostensibly Kyle) all imbued by his stern Christian Texas dad. This black and white mantra apparently allows him to rise to greatness as a sniper mowing down Iraqis. Kyle is depicted as being single-minded, yet regretful of having to pull the trigger. The Kyle of the novel was anything but regretful. There is no such philosophy provided by his father in the novel. Kyle, in his own words, was absolutely thrilled to be at war and gunning people down. There was no introspection or regret involved. He comes off badly as a clichéd white Texas, Christian gun fanatic, who was beside himself to find an outlet that allowed him to take out real people 'legally'. He informs us that had he not had a family that society expected him to return to, he would have been happy continuing on as a sniper. A long way from the outlook of the WW2 soldiers, who did their patriotic duty, but who looked forward only to returning home to their loved ones and peace at last.Kyle also claims to have killed two men in Texas and murdered at least 30 U.S. citizens in the wake of Hurricane Katrina from atop a post on the Superdome. If true, then he is a violent psychotic who used a conflict to disguise and promote his true inner self. If false, he is a habitual liar whose word on anything should be considered dubious. The latter is certainly backed up by a court case with Jesse Ventura where a jury rules against Kyle and he was forced to pay up.Even worse, Eastwood uses his film to blur history and try to gloss over the Bush administration's lawlessness in the Iraq debacle. Through clever images, he tries to link Iraq with 9/11, which is a long discredited lie. He never mentions the discredited reason for attacking Iraq, the weapons of mass destruction idiocy, because that would clash with the black and white viewpoint of the film and its main character. Instead of getting any kind of nuanced picture of Iraqis invaded and attacked in their own country for trumped up reasons, they are all depicted as crazed savages. All of Kyle's kills are, of course, justified despite split second reaction. The word 'hero' is blindly bandied about so much until it ultimately has no meaning whatsoever. The only performance of note is Bradley Cooper's central one, which is solid if not spectacular. Although truthfully, many of the scenes of Cooper being 'heroic' rather distressingly resemble the sequences in Inglorious Basterds where Daniel Bruehl's German 'hero' sniper sits in a bell tower repeatedly gunning down Allied troops, while the German audience viewing his escapades deliriously applaud over every death.The film also relies on American viewers being ignorant of the details of the Iraq conflict. Eastwood provides Kyle with an adversary of Bondian villainy - a sniper on the other side - with whom he gets to play a cat and mouse throughout the film. Incredibly, while this larger-than-life villain gets barely a mention in Kyle's book, he is elevated to gargantuan proportions in the film so that we can root for Kyle. The film also has this villain switch back and forth between Suni and Shia for convenience, which is something that would never happen. We are also shown another villain who drills holes in the heads of young boys, which would no doubt raise the outrage in anyone. Except such a sequence never happens in Kyle's book, and the screenwriters unwittingly give the background information on this character and give him a denomination that would have made him an ally to U.S. forces. But why should we care for piddly details when Eastwood and his writers don't.So in conclusion, we get a huge piece of propaganda that glosses over the origins of the Iraq War, turns its people into violent savages, gives George W. Bush and those responsible a pass and we are supposed to overlook its goal and content because its technical aspects are well done. At its center is Kyle, who repeatedly boasted that he loved killing and was glad to do it. A man who made a number of discredited claims. Most telling, Kyle claimed that the majority of the proceeds of his book would go to veterans charities. However, apparently less than 3% of the millions raked in have gone to said charities while the late Kyle and family kept the bulk. Certainly it is their choice, but propping up a con of massive charity at the expense of other fighting men, reveals a certain lack of honor and character. Is this really the hero we want representing America to the world? If yes, then we have fallen farther than expected. Audie Murphy must be rolling in his grave.",1,6,32,20 April 2015
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Lucas' showcase for CGI is a dismal wreck
","I did not think it is possible, but George Lucas has somehow excreted a sequel that manages to make the lameness of The Phantom Menace look like high art. At this point, it seems very clear that Lucas, irate that fans have pigeon-holed him into a niche as the auteur responsible for adventures in a galaxy far, far away, are going to seriously pay for it. And what better way than for Lucas to simply take a dump all over the opening trilogy that he has promised to provide for years? Attack of the Clones becomes the latest casualty of Lucas' incompetent writing and direction resulting in a much-awaited sequel that viewers hoped would improve on the problems of its predecessor, but instead finds entirely new ways to exploit and exacerbate them. The plot – such as it is – picks up roughly 10 years after the last film. Anakin Skywalker is now a strapping young man and acolyte of Jedi Master Ben Kenobi, who gets assigned as a glorified bodyguard to former Queen Amidala (now Senator Amidala), while Kenobi goes off in search of the supposed clone army of the title. There are a number of plot holes and inconsistencies as well as developments that simply fail to effectively dovetail with what viewers already know from the original trilogy. For instance, there is nothing especially heroic or admirable about the Jedi Knights as depicted in this film. They seem to be a suspiciously virginal monastic order with particular disdain for both emotions and outsiders – and they are almost laughably incompetent. They are constantly taken by surprise by enemies in their midst and most action scenes will be marked by a stretch where the Jedi participating will somehow lose their lightsabre during the battle. Yet their dialog – especially that as delivered by Samuel L. Jackson and the increasingly tiresome Yoda – is delivered with a smug self-righteousness that crosses the border of hypocrisy into arrogance. Also interesting is that Lucas fails to give us any reason as to why Amidala would be a target of assassination attempts since she brings nothing conceivable to the table to be a threat to anyone. It all functions as little more than a plot contrivance to throw Anakin and Amidala together for Lucas' ham-fisted idea of a romance. As though suddenly realizing that he needs to maneuver the future parents of Luke and Leia together, Lucas conspires painful passages awkwardly inserted into the story where we are supposed to see their relationship developing to a point where both parties buck the rules to become married. The film also continues to suffer from the lack of a good villain. Christopher Lee shows up late in the game as a sinister character called Count Dooku, but it impossible to tell in the mishmash of a story whether his goals are ultimately good or bad. Would that the attention Lucas has lavished on his overabundance of phony-looking CGI effects had been aimed at the story. C-3PO and R2-D2 are back, but used badly – especially in a concluding conveyor belt action scene that results in C-3PO's head being placed on an attack droid's body with assorted crummy one-liners in accompaniment. The various alien cultures that Lucas presents are not remotely imaginative and saddled with notable stereotypical English dialects. Ewan McGregor holds himself with a bit of dignity as Ben Kenobi, so it is a shame that Lucas has yet to write him a good role. Samuel L. Jackson's macho tough guy shtick is past its shelf life. Natalie Portman seems to become increasingly more catatonic as Amidala (her scene after falling out of a copter is high unintentional comedy). Poor Hayden Christensen has it the worst. He is stuck with the impossibly daunting task of eliciting audience sympathy for an anti-hero whose character arc is already known to the audience, trying to convince us that he is hopelessly enchanted with his wooden leading lady, and that he actually has a degree of mentor/student chemistry with McGregor, all while being saddled with bargain basement dialog that makes the central character seem little more than a shallow, petulant brat. He manages a couple of nice moments where he hints of the darkness to come, but is largely crushed by the Lucas ball of ineptitude. In the director chair, Lucas seems to have no idea how to generate suspense or pace the film in an effective manner. In fact, it often seems that the film functions as barely more than a showcase for his CGI effects studio. A dismal wreck that truly has completely derailed what should have been a far more promising and durable series.",2,2,5,4 August 2009
The Thing," A mess and a travesty of the 1951 classic
","There is a good reason why the 1951 The Thing is a classic. Howard Hawks influence is obvious and it packs the excitement, bravado and camaraderie that he brought to his westerns. It introduces us to a variety of characters that are amiable and sympathetic, and balances that with the conflict that erupts between the scientists and military in dealing with the alien threat that confronts them.Looking for anything of similar depth or entertainment value in John Carpenter's woebegone remake is pointless because it simply does not exist. This film adheres a bit more closely to the source novella by John W. Campbell Jr. Carpenter's version adopts an Invasion of the Body Snatchers mentality, wherein a creature 'infects' others and takes on their appearances to move about at will. It is an interesting concept, but it becomes apparent that the sole interest Carpenter has is in crafting progressively gorier and grotesque effects to gross-out the viewer.The film keeps the same setting in Antarctica and opens with some Norwegians attempting to kill a sled dog. The chase intersects with a group of Americans at a neighboring research facility, who think the Norwegians are crazy. When the dog is sheltered in the American facility, it is revealed to be The Thing of the title. The remainder of the film is basically a guessing game as to who is really human and who has become an assimilation of The Thing.The storyline sounds infinitely more exciting than it plays out. Carpenter has little to no interest in the characters populating his thriller. There are no women at the base and the men have little to no discernible personalities. There is not a role that is not filled by a capable actor, but no one manages to make much of an impression. Even lead Kurt Russell - doing another one of his lamentable John Wayne imitations - just blends into the bland background of bottled testosterone. Unlike Invasion of the Body Snatchers, where it seemed a distinct tragedy that the central characters were being turned into cold, unfeeling beings, the characters in this film are already relatively emotionless and so we feel no tragedy over their assimilation.It is easy to understand why Carpenter has no interest in plot, character development, or even building genuine suspense, his attention is too focused on the next special effects/make-up freak show extravaganza. All of the imagination seems to have been funneled into the next gore scene. The initial scene where The Thing departs its guise of the sled dog and launches an attack on the other dogs in the kennel is revolting on more levels than one can care to count. The dog's head splits open and the tentacled creature goes on a bloody rampage assimilating animals all around into a giant writhing wall of quivering flesh and fur that splits open in various spots to reveal writhing bloody innards. Animal lovers be forewarned. Full disclosure, when I initially attempted to watch this film (and being a fan of the 1951 original) I actually walked out of the theater shortly after this sequence. Several years later, I decided to give the film another chance and made it all the way through to the end.Later sequences are just as repellent. Body parts fly to and fro, chests are crushed, arms are bitten off, limbs take on lives of their own and try to skitter away. Again, lots of imagination, but it would have been far more impressive if Carpenter had channeled this initiative into more substantial areas of his epic. At the time, this depiction was a bit of a surprise coming from Carpenter, whose thrillers had heretofore largely eschewed graphic violence. Here, he makes up for it a hundred fold.Gradually the men are wittled away. Unfortunately, no one cares. There is no sense of urgency or concern for any of these people. They are all unknowable ciphers and easily interchangeable. We truly cannot tell who The Thing has infected less because of its diabolical nature than because the men are all written and played as colorless cookie-cutter tough guys from the average grade-C action film. Carpenter seems to have no idea how people would genuinely act in such a tense situation and there is no camaraderie amongst the men at all. None of them seem to be friends or work well together - they are a gaggle of lone wolf Marlboro Men braving the great unknown. Despite being isolated together and living in close quarters for months, none of them seem to know even the most minor of things about each other.The vague, ambiguous ending with two of the characters resting amongst the carnage, sharing a drink and trying to ascertain if the other one is human or The Thing is exceptionally vacuous. For one thing, knowing that The Thing propagates itself through body fluids, why in the world would the two men chance sharing a drink from the same bottle? Then again, do we really care about either of these guys? The answer would be a resounding no.Interestingly, the film has developed a cult following and fanatics talk about it like it is some sort of a classic. Unfortunately, nothing could have been further from the truth. At the time of release the film was a major box office disappointment and the majority of critical reviews were scathing. In fact, the only people who really seem to consider this some lost classic are gore hounds who think bloodletting should trump storytelling.",3,34,68,21 April 2011
Armageddon," A big barrel of noise and flashes for the ADD generation
","The second (and better) of 1998's dynamic duo of garbage about heavenly objects on a collision course with Earth - although this says more about the lousy quality of the earlier Deep Impact rather than any specific accomplishments of this ordeal. A giant asteroid is on a collision course with Earth and NASA taps oil rig worker Bruce Willis and his motley band to travel to the stars to intercept the asteroid, drill into it and blow it to pieces before impact. Naturally precursor fragments hit Earth first to give us a small taste of the disaster that could be coming. The entire scenario is ludicrous, but the film knows it and seems to revel in it. Dumb can be fun if done well, but Armageddon is not particularly well done, despite having some promising elements. Lead Willis normally has two settings depending on the project - smarmy and lifeless. Since this is a 'crowd-pleasing' action flick, he trots out smarmy and manages to be thoroughly obnoxious. Look quick for Owen Wilson and Michael Clarke Duncan as some of the lesser members of the team. Billy Bob Thornton acquits himself nicely slumming it up as a sympathetic NASA official. Will Patton also manages to turn in a 'real' performance as another oil rigger. Ben Affleck manages to be appealing in his first 'big budget' effort and Liv Tyler is coltishly sexy as Willis' daughter and the token love interest. Keeping in the spirit of the film's overwhelming machismo, she gets to stay behind and look fretful while the 'real' men do the work. Actually Jessica Steen accompanies as a co-pilot, but since someone forgot to write her a role she is fairly irrelevant. The screenplay is a mess - there is barely any sort of character development and suspense is marginal at best. The tone is jingoistic to the point of nausea - there are so many flags flying that it seems like Fox News Channel at its most pandering. The cinematography is like ball-bearings in a blender with assorted eyeball-burning flashes thrown in for good measure. There are literally no sustained shots for more than 3 seconds and action scenes are often incomprehensible due to so many non-stop quick cuts. A real endurance test visually with nothing there mentally to pick up the slack.",4,1,6,9 August 2010
The Village," Shyamalan well on his way to obscurity
","Director M. Night Shyamalan was considered something of a wunderkind when he burst upon the scene with the hit The Sixth Sense. His follow-up film, Unbreakable, was bound to underwhelm. This was largely because The Sixth Sense was so absurdly over-hyped that nothing could equal it, even though Unbreakable was arguably a more intriguing film. I even enjoyed Shyamalan's Signs, which was a big hit but which detractors slammed because they did not like the final reveal regarding the aliens. Shyamalan's next entry, The Village, is fairly indefensible.The film is set in some non-descript place and time, although the dress and characters seem to indicate the rural 17th or 18th century. An isolated village is populated by a large number of hard-working folk, who fear to cross the village boundaries lest the evil creatures that inhabit the surrounding wilderness terrorize them in rebuke. There is a love story of sorts with young village blacksmith Joaquin Phoenix spurning the flirtation of flighty Judy Greer in favor of village elder William Hurt's beautiful blind daughter Bryce Dallas Howard, who in turn is the unrequited love of seemingly harmless village idiot, Adrien Brody.There are a huge number of problems with the film and the majority of them stem from a writing/storytelling standpoint. The biggest problem is that Shyamalan has fallen into a trap wherein he apparently feels his films MUST follow a certain formula. Introduce a conventional story told fairly well and then cap it with a big twist that no one saw coming to make the viewer go back and re-evaluate all that went before. This works well in The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, has mixed results in Signs, and fails miserably here.It is particularly tragic here because Shyamalan handles the opening passages regarding the village, its denizens and their fearfulness of the unknown waiting just beyond the village outskirts quite well. The film captures the flavor of a Grimm fairy tale and there is undeniable suspense when Phoenix, testing the boundaries of the village taboo, moves beyond the village limits and the mysterious creatures descend upon the village to launch an attack during a wedding. If the story continued on in this straightforward vein, Shyamalan may well have had another hit on his hands. Unfortunately, he unleashes one far-fetched and wrong-headed 'surprise' revelation after another in the final two-thirds that shoot the film in the foot and then run it off a cliff. And for the record, I was able to predict the 'shock' ending while standing in line looking at the poster and pontificating aloud that if Shyamalan really wanted a crummy climax this is what he would do...and he did it! Shyamalan has compiled a solid cast, but they are often not well used. One can forgive Shyamalan for having a shocking Hitchcock-style attack on a main character that sidelines them at the midway point, but when one sees where this set-up is going and how wasted the actor in general ends up being, it just becomes lamentable. The only cast member to truly come out of this smelling like a rose is Howard. She is appealing and charming and provides some much-needed energy to the film. By contrast, the normally reliable Phoenix has been instructed to play his role in such an introverted fashion as to appear catatonic. Hurt is uncomfortably affected as the village elder and Sigourney Weaver is sadly wasted as another elder and Phoenix's mother. The film seems to be building to something between her and Hurt, but then forgets about it. However, all of them have it made compared to Brody, who is strait-jacketed into the role of the happy mute idiot who abruptly turns into a psychotic stalker by plot fiat. Finally, we come to the final third of the film, which puts the nail in its coffin. Sadly, we come to realize that the entire point of this exercise was an excuse for Shyamalan to wow us with this asinine twist. It does not work. It does not work because the story worked immeasurably better when taken at face value. It does not work because a twist without a decent story to back it up is pointless. It does not work because scrutiny of the dates on the cemetery grave markers bely its foolishness. It does not work because it relies upon an almost impenetrable suspension of disbelief in regard to the motivations of the elders. Why would supposedly 'sensitive' and well-meaning people place their purportedly loved offspring in such predicaments, attempt to rob them of their free will, and then absolve themselves from helping when matters hit rock bottom? This latter is especially irritating when Hurt makes his various revelations to his daughter. After copping to the truth of the reality of the village, why on earth does he not make the final journey himself instead of sending his blind daughter off into the wilderness on an arduous and potentially deadly rescue mission, particularly when time is of the essence? The lack of credibility in these actions is mind-numbing. One can just imagine Shyamalan thinking how novel and suspenseful it will be to send a blind woman off on an adventure without wondering whether it makes any narrative sense to do so. It is also absurd that the film never gives Weaver's character any kind of soul-searching moment in these final passages considering what is at stake. Do none of these village elders have a conscience? Between the misused cast, the narrative and logic lapses, the predictable yet laughable twist ending, and the promising opening squandered on folly, the film is never more than a painful memory and never less than a monument of a filmmakers tragic overindulgence. I would say better luck next time, but alas Shyamalan seems to be on a spiral downward with his subsequent follow-ups.",Null,2,3,6 August 2011
The Shining," Atmospheric, but overrated thriller
","Arguably one of the most loved/loathed 'haunted house' thrillers ever. Stanley Kubrick/Jack Nicholson fans cannot seem to praise it enough, while fans of Stephen King's legendary novel are decidedly more lukewarm towards it. Personally I find the film rather schizophrenic, which leaves me somewhere in the middle. Anyone hoping to see even a marginally faithful adaptation of the King novel will be sorely disappointed as aside from the very bare bones of the story, many of King's memorable set pieces and much of the emotional pull of his story has been abandoned. Aspiring writer Jack Torrance and family are hired on to become caretakers of the oppressive Overlook Hotel during its off season in the wilds of the Rocky Mountains. Despite the threat of isolation and stories of a prior caretaker who went mad and murdered his family, the Torrances persevere and find out that the hotel has some rather nasty spooks determined to set Jack against his wife and son. Director Kubrick provides a chilling and ominous atmosphere thanks to hypnotic cinematography and amazing sets. The corridors of the hotel seem to go on forever. The film has its decidedly chilling moments – particularly the appearances of murdered twins, Nicholson's ax-wielding attack on wife Shelley Duvall and a memorable chase through a wintry labyrinth. Unfortunately, it has some glaring problems narratively and with its lead performance that cannot be overlooked. The title of the film is the slang term given to a psychic power possessed by both Danny Lloyd as the son and Scatman Crothers, as a hotel chef. In the King novel, the power was a major player in the story. In the film, both Danny and his power seem an afterthought and the hotel – which was decidedly malevolent in King's story – comes across as rather a neutral entity that just houses nasty specters. Danny's primal fear that his father will turn into a monster that will murder he and his mother is oddly muted in the film – largely because Kubrick treats the characters and their emotional plight as of little consequence and is much more concerned with setting the stage for Nicholson to enact his raving madman performance. Sadly, Nicholson's much-ballyhooed central performance nearly derails the film. At no point does anyone buy him as a caring husband/father who makes a shocking transition into a psycho. Instead, Nicholson plays him from the outset as a creepy nut with pedophile mannerisms to such an extent, that it becomes impossible to believe that anyone would follow him into another room much less into a 3-month isolation with a young child. While Lloyd is largely relegated to prop status speaking in a strange voice and drooling, Nicholson stomps and chomps the scenery sputtering, snarling, and hissing in between inappropriate one-liners. There is no doubt that his madman act is impressive, but it is also one-note and robs his character of any sympathy. Seriously, from frame one there is not one moment where he seems relatively normal and there is no moment where he shows any reluctance in his descent into madness. This film also serves the dubious distinction of marking when Nicholson's performances segued from real acting into caricature until About Schmidt came to the rescue. By contrast, it is not until reflection that one realizes Duvall, as his terrified wife, has delivered the film's best performance and shown him up. Additionally, the final shot of the film, which is apparently supposed to be a surprise, is anything but, indicating that Kubrick and his writers are not overly familiar with horror genres conventions. Yet for all its faults, the atmosphere and lavishness provided by Kubrick is a definite must-see in that few subsequent thrillers have been able to compete with it and he does provide moments they stay with you, even if the end product is not as impressive as some of its parts.",7,1,2,18 March 2010
American Beauty," Some brilliant parts, but the whole is underwhelming
","Interesting, but staggeringly overrated comedy-drama focusing on the rot and discontent underneath the pristine front of suburbia. The film opens with narration from Kevin Spacey advising us that he is dead and detailing the events that led to his demise. Spacey is a typical example of the depressed suburban husband and father. His marriage to shrewish Realtor wife Annette Bening is miserable and he is barely on speaking terms with truculent daughter Thora Birch, who is developing a flirtation with the shy young videographer/drug dealer next door (Wes Bentley). Spacey cracks when he is forced out of his company and goes through a complete life change - including striking up a friendship with Bentley and a flirtation with his daughter's jailbait high school friend Mena Suvari. This is something of an odd film tone-wise. I can find few people that will say they out-and-out love it, but instead they will concentrate on certain elements and praise those factors to the exclusion of others. The acting is really a selling point for this film. Spacey simply has never been better and will probably always be identified with this role. The young cast members are all quite compelling. Suvari's arrogant pretensions give way to a rather touching vulnerability late in the film, while Birch reveals an appealing side with Bentley that is missing from her interactions with her parents. Bentley has also never been better as the intense guy next door, who sells drugs and copes with abusive homophobic dad Chris Cooper, but manages to find beauty through his video camera in the most unlikely places. The remainder of the adults fare less well. Allison Janney has a thankless role as Bentley's catatonic mother, while Cooper is largely a one-note caricature. Much ink has been spilled about Bening and while one can give kudos that she is unafraid to tackle head on a thoroughly unappealing character, it is undeniable that she is really playing a nasty harpy on one strident note. Spacey keeps reminding us that she 'was not always like this', but our only indication is a flashback to her laughing on a carnival ride, which is hardly conclusive of any range to her character. Some of her scenes - beating herself up after failing to make a sale and the laughable sex scenes with Peter Gallagher - are downright amateurish. There are a number of sequences in this film that are truly arresting and memorable, but for every one that astonishes there are an equal amount that go no where or just completely fizzle. Indeed the film seems to carry an attitude that it is much more insightful than it truly is. The entire scenario of dysfunction underneath the surface of suburbia and its denizens revealing themselves to be polar opposites of what their surface may hint is an old plot device used often well before American Beauty discovered it, so what this film presents is hardly novel or groundbreaking. The end result is a polished film featuring some strong performances and a handful of amazing moments, counteracted by a number of forgettable plot contrivances, a surprising shallowness and an uneven tone that often keeps the viewer at an emotional arm's length.",6,1,4,25 January 2011
The Patriot," Absolute rubbish
","Utter bilge disguised as history lesson which plays as such a typical example of a latter-day auto-pilot Mel Gibson career effort that one could go down a checklist. Over the top violence? Check. Gibson cast as a one-dimensional character who endures a ridiculous amount of physical turmoil? Check. Cartoony villains? Check. Death(s) of major supporting character(s) to give Gibson's lead a motivated vendetta? Check. The depiction of the British army is so laughable that it seems impossible they could have ever amassed an empire at all much less won any hard fought battles. Gibson is typically and unmemorably cast as a French-Indian War veteran and widowed father of a gigantic brood (no doubt Mrs. Martin expired from prolonged stays in the delivery room). He hopes to avoid any conflict in the forthcoming Revolutionary War, but when his family is targeted and threatened by Snidely Whiplash (oops, I mean Jason Isaacs channeling Snidely Whiplash), naturally a macho man has to do what a man has to do. The late Heath Ledger is on hand as Gibson's eldest son Gabriel. He looks pretty in Revolutionary War outfits, but there is little more to the role than that. Trivia claims that screenwriter Robert Rodat penned 17 drafts before settling on the current version. He should have penned at least another 17 more because the final version is trash. The film has all of the depth of a puddle. The British are all evil and stupid, Gibson is some unholy combo of Rambo and George Washington, and to say that the film takes liberty with facts is an understatement of massive proportions. One scene involves the British army locking unarmed women, children and old people in a church (including a major supporting character) and setting it ablaze murdering all inside. Try as I might, I have researched this and cannot locate so much as one recorded incident of such a thing being perpetrated by the British army in the Revolutionary War. The film's most laughable moment features Joely Richardson, as Gibson's sister-in-law and token love interest, being placed in charge of caring for his underage brood. When the British arrive at her home to take them prisoner, she literally sneaks them out under an entire platoon's nose by hiding under tables and behind bushes, etc. My description fails to do the lunacy justice - I thought perhaps I had wandered in to a children's fantasy-adventure for a moment. Total garbage - I suggest fans of this film pick up a book and read about the Revolutionary War - it would really be eye-opening for them.",2,10,20,26 May 2010
Van Helsing," Sounds promising on paper; far less so in execution
","Director Stephen Sommers was fresh off the success of The Mummy films, when he apparently had the inspiration to start a new franchise centering on the legendary Van Helsing character. Fanboys everywhere began imagining what older actor would take the part. The announcement then came that hunky Hugh Jackman would play the role of a younger Van Helsing, who would not just hunt vampires but a variety of monsters from the Universal stable. Enthusiasm was through the roof...then the film came out and the end result was like air being let out of a balloon.Jackman does indeed play Van Helsing, who is an assassin on behalf of the Vatican crossing the globe offing monsters. The film opens with him taking down Mr. Hyde and running afoul of the law. Then he is dispatched to Transylvania to deal with Dracula and his brides that are trying to procreate. This all has something to with Frankenstein's Monster and a werewolf, but if you can figure out how then you are doing better than I am.The film boasts a strong cast who are often not given anything of worth to do, an array of special effects, and a frenetic pace that will hopefully distract from the fact that the story is an overstuffed mess. The film would have been far more better to have focused on one or two monsters instead of the bunch we have here. We get Dracula and his three brides, Frankenstein, the Wolf Man, Mr. Hyde and a villainous Igor (badly played by Kevin O'Connor). Frankenstein is never adequately worked into the plot and the Wolf Man seems an afterthought. Along with these characters, the film also must make room for Kate Beckinsale's sexy tough-as-nails gypsy co-hort and David Wenham as a dorky friar aiding our hero. It is just too much.It also does not help that the film comes across like a wall of noise. There is never much sense or fun or charm to anything we see. The non-stop visual effects are a real mixed bag. The effects involving Dracula and his brides are fine, but Mr Hyde looks like a cross between Gumby and The Hulk and the werewolf effects are embarrassing. Why is it that 30 years ago we were getting state-of-the-art werewolf effects in The Howling and An American Werewolf in London, but these latest CGI werewolf effects look like crap? Also, the plot never makes it clear why the Vatican forces Van Helsing to work on the wrong side of the law when writs from them would instantaneously give him the cache to do whatever need be done.Of the cast, Will Kemp as the werewolf and Shuler Hensley as Frankenstein may as well not be in it for all of the focus they get. Roxburgh does little but snarl as Dracula. Wenham has some amusing moments and Beckinsale has never been sexier.I am a huge Hugh Jackman fan. I have had the privilege to see him in films, on stage and in person, and the man oozes personality and charisma from every pore. In Van Helsing, he is completely underwhelming. He has been handed a role that could have been filled by a stunt man without noticing a difference. Van Helsing as written has no character traits, no humor, no charisma, no history and no presence. He stands unsmiling, with a variety of weapons, and grunts or recites lines in a one-note grizzled tough guy voice. The actor that humanized Wolverine and became a star with X-Men is apparently on vacation here. He does get to do a lot of running, jumping, climbing, falling and swinging. He dons a loincloth in one scene, but alas no nudity to compensate for the absence of anything else.Much could be forgiven if the film was dumb fun (like The Mummy), but it is not. It is loud, annoying, incoherent, squanders a great leading man and promising supporting cast, contains dreadful werewolf effects and ultimately is little more than a big waste of time.",4,2,5,12 October 2014
Dreamgirls," Bland and flat
","Dreamgirls, despite its fistful of Tony wins in an incredibly weak year on Broadway, has never been what one would call a jewel in the crown of stage musicals. However, that is not to say that in the right cinematic hands it could not be fleshed out and polished into something worthwhile on-screen. Unfortunately, what transfers to the screen is basically a slavishly faithful version of the stage hit with all of its inherent weaknesses intact. First, the score has never been one of the strong points of this production and the film does not change that factor. There are lots of songs (perhaps too many?), but few of them are especially memorable. The closest any come to catchy tunes are the title song and One Night Only - the much acclaimed And I Am Telling You That I Am Not Going is less a great song than it is a dramatic set piece for the character of Effie (Jennifer Hudson). The film is slick and technically well-produced, but the story and characters are surprisingly thin and lacking in any resonance. There is some interest in the opening moments, watching Jamie Foxx's Svengali-like manager manipulate his acts to the top, but that takes a back seat in the latter portion of the film, when the story conveniently tries to cast him as a villain, despite his having been right from a business stand-point for a good majority of the film. Beyonce Knowles is lovely and sings her songs perfectly well, but is stuck with a character who is basically all surface glitz. Anika Noni Rose as the third member of the Dreamgirls trio literally has nothing to do for the entire film. Eddie Murphy acquits himself well as a singer obviously based on James Brown, but the role is not especially meaty and ultimately has little impact. Foxx would seem ideal casting, but he seems oddly withdrawn and bored. The film's biggest selling point is surely former American Idol contestant/Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson in the central role of Effie White, the temperamental singer who gets booted from the group and makes a triumphant closing act return. For me, Effie has always been a big problem in both the show and the movie. The film obviously wants you to feel sorry for her and rather ham-handedly takes her side, but I have never been sure that this character deserves that kind of devotion. From the start, Effie conducts herself for the most part like an obnoxious, egotistical, self-centered diva, who is more interested in what everyone else can do for her rather than having much vested interest in the group of which she is a part. When she is booted from the group for her unprofessionalism and bad attitude, the charges are more than well-founded, but the stage show/film seem to think Effie should be cut unlimited slack simply because she has a great voice. Even though the film tries to soften some of Effie's harder edges to make her more likable, the charges still stand. Her story becomes more manipulative by suggesting she should have our further sympathy because she is an unwed mother struggling to raise her daughter - using the implication that (much like the talent card) motherhood immediately makes any behavior excusable. Indeed the only big effort the film makes to show Effie's mothering is to tell us about it and then include a scene where she barks at her daughter in the unemployment office, insists that the girl has 'no father' and then refuse to look for gainful employment to support them since singing is all she knows. In the hands of a skillful actress, the gaps could perhaps have been remedied with technique and charisma. Unfortunately, Hudson is not that actress. She sings well, but the dialog-driven moments do not come naturally to her nor do high emotional moments. Effie's signature moment (the aforementioned And I Am Telling You... number) is well-sung by Hudson, but emotionally flat in the acting department. Effie is supposed to expressing her rage and desperation at her predicament, but Hudson comes off as a cabaret performer belting out a hot number. All in all, not quite the emotional highlight one expects. The latter portion of the film is basically a predictable melange of events that maneuver Foxx into Hudson's earlier position and allow her to strut back in and lord it over everyone. Foxx's criminal offenses in the film are undoubtedly par for the course of many struggling record producers, but the film's seeming implication that he has it coming because he helped usher in the disco era is rather ridiculous, not to mention pretentious and condescending, particularly coming from a film with all of the depth of a puddle. The end result is a faithful rendition of the stage hit, drained of emotion, energy or anything that can be described as dynamic.",4,18,30,25 June 2007
Mamma Mia!," Pleasant, but unremarkable rendition of the far better stage hit
","Back when the stage show Mamma Mia first arrived, I refused to see it largely because it sounded inane to me. A year later still going strong on Broadway, I knuckled under and was stunned at how much joyful fun that it turned out to be. The energy between the performers and the audience and the show's unflinchingly sunny demeanor were infectious. Unfortunately, these are elements that are incredibly difficult to translate to the screen, as proved by the film adaptation of the same show.The slight storyline is a transparent reworking of Buena Sera, Mrs. Campbell. Set on an exotic Greek island, Meryl Streep finds her world turned upside-down when wedding preparations for her daughter Amanda Seyfried to Dominic Cooper are interrupted by the arrival of three men from her past, one of whom unknowingly is the father of the bride. The storyline only has to be good enough to hang a wide diversity of ABBA songs on – and for the most part it is. However, the film takes some liberties from the play that simply do not work on screen.The lion's share of the muted effect of this film, cannot be laid at the feet of the cast or the screenplay, but on the direction. Director Phyllida Lloyd does not seem to know how to film production numbers for maximum impact or stages them in such a completely inappropriate way as to diminish them. As a result, numbers that worked incredibly well on stage are re-staged here amateurishly. Several times, Lloyd actually interrupts numbers that have real potential to cut away to dialog scenes and then never returns to the music. This happens several times. Other numbers are clumsily rendered to try to get a laugh which takes the winds out of the sails of the performers. Julie Walters' version of Take a Chance of Me is constantly upstaged by crummy attempts at physical comedy which prevent the actress from really belting it out of the park, which anyone who has heard her on the soundtrack knows she could do. Similarly, Does Your Mother Know was a show-stopper on stage and would seem a perfect fit for Christine Baranski, but the filming and choreography of the number in the film comes across like ball bearings in a garbage disposal, leaving the viewer to wonder at its end, 'Is that it?' This is not to suggest that the film does not have its moments or some charm. Streep is surprisingly appealing and amusing despite a pleasant, but limited vocal range. Walters and Baranski are amusing as her friends, although they are never given the opportunities of their stage counterparts to really showcase their vocal and comic chops. One respects the efforts of the film to beef up the male roles to some extent, but this has limited success. Stellan Skarsgaard is fine, but the comedic aspects appear to have been drained from what was a very funny role on the stage. I like Pierce Brosnan in most everything, but when he opens his mouth to sing, some unholy combination of Joe Cocker and Winston Churchill bursts forth that makes one want to drive spikes into their ears. The relief that they have spared us his mutilating Knowing Me, Knowing You, is short-lived when we then must endure a tortuous new addition for him at the end. Of the three male leads, Colin Firth comes across as the most charming and appealing and reveals a sweet singing voice. I do have a problem with the film's treatment of his character, though. In the play, it is not unexpectedly revealed that Harry is gay and has a long-time partner back in England. Here, while I have no problem with the film pairing Harry up with a hot younger guy in Greece to keep him close to his newfound 'family', the ludicrous build-up that heretofore this guy in his late 40s had 'no idea' that he was gay until exchanging some barely noticeable glances with a male bartender feeds into a lot of misguided myths about homosexuality being a choice. Seyfried is a revelation as the daughter and she is nicely matched by the hot, underused Cooper as her paramour – who sadly does his one production number in bathing trunks and not a form-fitting Speedo like his stage counterpart.In the end, the film is pleasant, easy on the eyes, and a relatively painless 90 minutes, but never comes close to capturing the lightning-in-a-bottle, unapologetically cheesy charisma of the mega-hit Broadway show.",6,1,1,3 April 2009
Batman Begins," Strong reboot to the Batman saga
","Kudos must be given to Tim Burton, who rescued the Batman character from the bottom of the barrel campy 1960s TV show and gave him some respect with his Gothic-inspired 1989 blockbuster and its sequel Batman Returns before Joel Schumacher put a nail in the coffin with Batman and Robin. Similarly, one must now give thanks to director Christopher Nolan, who reboots the franchise in a completely new and exhilarating manner.This film, aptly named Batman Begins, retells the Bruce Wayne/Batman creation, but does so in a fresh way. It documents Wayne's journey from young boy, whose parents are tragically taken from him, to a disillusioned young man, who watches helplessly as criminal kingpins go free without repercussions to dominate the landscape of Gotham City. The action takes on a new angle as Wayne departs his beloved Gotham City and disappears for a number of years ostensibly to find himself. He is recruited at one point by the enigmatic Liam Neeson, head of a rather shadowy organization, and mentored in fighting skills and mental acuity. When the true evil purpose of the organization is made known, Wayne balks, escapes and returns to Gotham to claim his mantle as the scion of the wealthy Wayne fortune. He also intends to launch a daunting campaign to reclaim Gotham City from its criminal elements in the guise of frightening vigilante Batman.Ironically, whereas many proclaimed Burton's vision in 1989, it is now fairly decried in favor of Nolan's more thoughtful, realistic take on the legend. Truthfully, it is difficult to gauge the success of the two films together as both visually and tonally they are so different. Nolan certainly succeeds in areas where few have attempted to take a comic book franchise previously. He presents fully realized characters, firmly establishes their relationships to one another and allows the story and action to generate logically and organically from those roots. Characters that were given short shrift in both the earlier films, TV show and even the comics, are nicely fleshed out here and given far more vital roles. The expert cast certainly helps in that area.Intriguingly, this certainly marks the first time that the Bruce Wayne/Batman character emerges as the most interesting person in the film and seems about time that he was not overshadowed by the villains of the piece. Christian Bale crafts a fascinating portrait of Bruce Wayne and his alter ego - with his Batman a lot more intimidating than earlier versions. This also ranks as the first time that there is shown to be an intentional effort to present a public front to Wayne that would seem to make him an unlikely suspect as Batman. Bale moves effortlessly between the thoughtful seriousness of the real Wayne, the boozy disaffection of the public Wayne, and the primal charge of his new nighttime creation.Alfred the faithful manservant has always been present, but underused in the Batman lore and it is nice to see the role not only beefed up considerably, but played by such a reliable stalwart actor as Michael Caine. If Alfred has had it bad, then Commissioner Gordon (here Lt. Gordon) has often been portrayed as a overweight oaf or a sputtering nitwit. How refreshing to see a dignified Gary Oldman in the role portraying Gordon as one of the few honest cops left in a corrupt police force and a wholehearted backstage supporter of Batman. Linus Roache provides a warming presence as Wayne's visionary father and Morgan Freeman is a more than welcome addition as a new character, who basically becomes Batman's Q - creator of all those wonderful gadgets.The action sequences are exciting and believable without overwhelming everything around them and Nolan keeps everything moving at an invigorating pace until the climax.If the film has any missteps - and they are minor - it comes in two areas.First, the film does not really establish a primary villain for our hero to challenge, which seems a bit strange. While it is interesting to see Batman deal with mundane gangster-types, as embodied largely by Tom Wilkinson, they are lacking the true dynamic of a great villain. Neeson and his cadre are ostensibly the biggest villains of the piece, but they do not emerge as such for some time and then offscreen again for a huge chunk of the film. The most memorable of the villains in the film is certainly Cillian Murphy's chilling Dr. Jonathan Crane and his alter ego - the Scarecrow. Nolan and Murphy coordinate a fairly plausible adaptation of a rather ludicrous villain. Unfortunately, Crane remains a largely supporting character. As wide-ranging as the diabolical plan of the League of Shadows is and as well-acted as the various villains are, none of them really seem much of a challenge for the hero.The second misstep is much more minor, although still an irritation. The film adds another character - an assistant district attorney, played by Katie Holmes, who is also a childhood friend of Bruce Wayne and his unrequited romantic interest. All heroes need their leading ladies in some form, but did Nolan and company really have to make this Rachel Dawes such a wet blanket. One can certainly admire her do-gooder sensibilities and her tenacity in facing down intimidating opponents, but her irritatingly preachy diatribes at Wayne grate. She seems especially insensitive of his feelings during the debacle of the trial of his parents' murderer. Holmes really does not help matters here either. She brings kittenish sex appeal to the role, but does not have much chemistry with Bale, is not particularly convincing as an attorney and never seems to be operating on the same level as the rest of the stellar cast.That said, this was certainly a most promising and invigorating beginning to a series that had fallen into almost laughable disgrace.",Null,0,1,19 July 2011
Meet the Fockers," All-star craptacular
","In Meet the Parents, Ben Stiller was a jittery boyfriend planning to ask for his girlfriend's hand and desperate to win the approval of her parents, particularly ex-CIA borderline psychotic dad Robert DeNiro, only to find his efforts consistently blowing up in his face through a series of Murphy's Law-style shenanigans. It was not trying to be the greatest film ever made and generated enough genuine belly laughs and pleasantness to rank as a success. Certainly part of the success was generated from the prickly chemistry between DeNiro and Stiller, and the fact that pretty much anyone could identify with the well-meaning efforts made by Stiller that did not pan out. Naturally a sequel was concocted wherein the future in-laws would now meet Stiller's folks. Sadly the pleasantness and belly laughs of the original are missing in action, despite amping up the cast. DeNiro's conservative ex-CIA psycho is etched to such a one-note extreme that he seems to be one-day shy of becoming an ax murderer. Stiller has been reduced to doing nothing but stare slack-jawed from the sidelines. Similar to the first film, both Teri Polo (as the girlfriend) and Blythe Danner (as her mom) are treated as slightly better than props. As Stiller's parents, the casting department scores the coup of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand. In fairness, I dreaded Streisand, but surprisingly found her playing the only character that could seemingly exist outside of this film and one of the few to not irritate me beyond measure. She is not given anything particularly funny to do, but she does play her role well enough. By contrast Hoffman, portraying the kind of touchy-feely overly emotional liberal that exists only in the minds of crummy screenwriters and FOX News pundits, is excruciating to endure. Watching he and DeNiro, both of them playing extreme caricatures that could not possibly survive in the real world detached from this woeful film, is nearly surreal in its badness. The comedy at large is dreadful - with much of it being divided between the Fockers hormone-crazed dog that DeNiro's cat tries to flush down the toilet in a painfully strained moment, and DeNiro's obnoxious tot grandson (is there another kind?) that he has dragged along for cheap reaction shots. Competition for the film's lowest moment (aside from any time Hoffman opens his mouth) is fierce. Normally I would defer to the introduction of the Focker's busty Latin maid (who also provided Stiller's first sexual experience), which results in unending shots of the baby grandson leering at her cleavage. However, the worst is given an entire time-consuming subplot to pad out this already odious film, wherein DeNiro becomes convinced that the maid's good-natured teenage son is really Stiller's love child. With no proof whatsoever and no thought to the consequences this would have an innocent bystander, DeNiro shoots up Stiller with sodium pentathol, convinces him the teen is his child, and then systematically sets in motion the public humiliation of BOTH Stiller and the teen. Thereafter, the plot strand is dropped - with no further appearance by the kid nor any inference that anyone has told him this was all a lie. This entire scenario must take up roughly 30+ minutes of screen time, generates nary one laugh, and then is completely forgotten like there were not people other than Stiller who were injured by DeNiro's machinations. Owen Wilson makes a brief return at the end (seriously he and Stiller should be banned from working together), but charitable viewers may forget he is in it. There is talk of another sequel, but I have seen enough Fockers (and members of DeNiro's family) to last a lifetime after this sequel.",1,1,2,28 October 2008
Saving Private Ryan," Great opening sequence, then downhill into overrated territory
","Following the WW2 D-Day Normandy Beach landing, a platoon of soldiers led by Tom Hanks are dispatched on a glorified public relations stunt to locate and retrieve the title private from the front lines.Director Steven Spielberg can be a great filmmaker, but one must beware of his 'serious' efforts designed to win over his detractors, film critics and Oscar voters. These 'serious' films can run from the masterful like The Color Purple or Schindler's List (despite a few missteps in its final moments) to overrated misfires (The Empire of the Sun). SPR falls squarely in the overrated, mediocre category. Oscar voters actually made the correct decision in passing it over for the Best Picture Oscar.The opening moments - depicting the Normandy landing - are impressive. Unfortunately, the film loses that momentum the moment its story kicks in. For one thing, no one is rooting for a mission that takes these men into danger for what is basically a rather asinine publicity stunt. While it is true that the U.S. Armed Forces did attempt to return home men whose siblings had all died serving their country to avoid wiping out an entire generation of a family, this was done by sending word to that soldier's unit of his planned extraction and then doing so at a convenient moment. Entire platoons were never sent on glorified rescue missions for low-level serviceman that placed large numbers of people at unnecessary risk. So the plot is largely preposterous.While there are a number of great war films that can get away with presenting types in place of three-dimensional characters, this film is not one of them. There is very little camaraderie among these men and they largely blur together. We know them less as individuals than by the types they are presented as - and none of them are truly able to break out of these constrictions. For instance, we identify them solely as the second in command, the Italian guy, the Jewish guy, the newbie coward, the medic, the sniper, the jerk.Incredibly for Spielberg, who usually features rich cinematography, this film is ugly to even look at. Everything is filmed in shades of gray, washed-out blue and dirt colors, often using a jittery hand-held camera for a 'you are there' feel that functions more to generate either a headache or motion sickness rather than any sort of authenticity.Once the men start off on their mission, the story repeats the same steps over and over again. One of the men will reveal something minor about themselves (i.e., a personality trait) and then be brutally killed in the next scene in the most drawn-out agonizing way possible. Then the men will trudge forth, another man will reveal something, and then be eviscerated in the following scene. One could almost do a Lawrence Welk to this - 'And a one-a, and a two-a and BLAM!' The predictability of the action becomes wearisome and the only suspense lies in figuring what manner of unspeakable demise will pop up next. Will it be a bloody gunshot wound or will someone be blasted apart with Spielberg uncharacteristically allowing the gore and body parts to drench the jitter-cam? This predictable nature also allows to realize exactly where the film is headed.For instance, if the film remains true to clichés, then once the surviving men meet Private Ryan, we anticipate that he will be a sunny all-American young man impossible to hate. We also anticipate that he will be a stand-up guy that will refuse to abandon the other members of his squadron in their hour of need, so that the surviving members of his rescue mission will be suitably impressed enough to stay to fight with them. When the diminished rescue party does reach him and be turns out to be Matt Damon, drawing out his biggest aw-shucks grin and practically oozing middle-American likability, you know the film has no surprise anywhere on its repertoire.The majority of the supporting cast could change their roles and no one would notice so little impact are they allowed to make and so few are the facets to their respective characters. Two exceptions that stand out (and not in a good way) are Jeremy Davies' absolute descent into pure ham with his breakdown on the stairs and Edward Burns' unintended utter obnoxiousness throughout the course of the film. Tom Hanks is likable as usual, but he is playing...Tom Hanks. Only this time, with a slight quiver to his hand to key us in on the toll this war is taking on him.By the time the film rolls into its final moments, it has been an exhausting, unpleasant viewing experience - or something misguided people like to pretend is 'powerful'. Anyone with an iota of sense knows that 'war is hell', but that does not mean we want to pay to have it inflicted on us for nearly 3 hours without break. I think I finally had enough at the climax when one of the men held on to a grenade too long and literally blew apart - with all of the gore that implies. I stayed to the foregone conclusion, but I think I had shut off from that moment on.And a foregone conclusion it is since Spielberg rather strangely opens the film with the elderly living Ryan visiting Arlington cemetery and then closes it again with him in another one of his clumsy codas. I have no idea what to say when Ryan turns to his family and wonders if the men's sacrifice was all worth it. However, I do know that this film, despite its most ardent admirers should not be considered one the great war films ever made. For all of its patriotism and attempts at realism, for all its brutality and in-your-face approach, its story and characters are just not worth that amount of consideration.",Null,1,2,1 August 2011
The Favourite," Misleading advertising - depressing and overrated
","Set during the 18th century reign of Queen Anne in England, The Favourite focuses primarily on the dueling relationship between two women - Lady Sarah of Marlborough and her cousin Abigail - in their bid to oust the other from a position of power in court through the Queen's favor.Judging from the non-stop adverts for the film and its designation at the Golden Globes, one would expect to view a savage comedy of manners, but instead the final result is anything but comical. More often than not, it is downright depressing, tiresome and childish. The film gives us a brief crash course in the political maneuvering. Parliament is split, there is a war going on, taxes are high and everyone is jockeying for a foothold on which to sway the Queen. The serious decision making seems to be delegated to the Queen's current favorite lady-in-waiting, Sarah, a childhood friend. Into the mix arrives Sarah's black sheep cousin Abigail, who initially snags a job as a maid, but ingratiates herself with Sarah, and then ultimately the Queen. This leads to a power play between Sarah and Abigail as to who will retain the Queen's favor.Where to start! Given that the film strives for some degree of authenticity and received serious awards, it appears to play havoc with both facts and atmosphere. I really do not see ladies-in-waiting at court dropping f-bombs. The film also devolves into a series of sordid lesbian encounters between the Queen and Sarah, and later the Queen and Abigail. Granted that history is up in the air about whether or not such encounters happened or were the product of malicious gossip intended to damage the Queen, much of it ostensibly initiated by Sarah in retaliation for being replaced. However, I think given the players and history involved, there are more intriguing stories to be told here than settling on questionable salacious encounters as a centerpiece. Unfortunately, that is not the road chosen by the writers and the director.The film is not overly long in running time, but ultimately feels at least double. Not sure if it is just me, but the odd score was off-putting as well. Technical aspects like costumes, sets, etc., are top-notch.Emma Stone gives one of her best performances as the initially fresh-faced, but ultimately manipulative Abigail. She seems genuinely concerned and open, so the audience gets suckered into her machinations as well. Conversely, Rachel Weisz is all subtlety, intelligence and snark, as Sarah. The film dramatically overstates the kind of power the Queen gave Sarah in governance, but Weisz is completely credible pushing around sputtering men of power and leaving them stewing in their own juices.Where I differ in the acting department is in Olivia Colman's performance as Queen Anne. Anne was considered a bland monarch (barring the lesbian gossip) plagued by miscarriages, the deaths of children, and questionable health, but still managed to rank some serious accomplishments during her reign. Colman was a surprise upset winner for Best Actress, but damned if I know why. Although I did not carry a stop watch, it seems that Colman has less screen time than co-stars Stone and Weisz, who landed in the supporting actress category, which makes her inclusion as Best Actress indefensible. Worse, I really find her the least of the three actresses here. Colman's Anne is depicted as an easily manipulated, weak, mewling child. We never get any indication that this woman could rise to the occasion of even minimal leadership. She is a one-note caricature to be either pitied or repelled by, who is eternally at the mercies of outside forces and the whims of heinous lying shrews. I freely admit that my disdain for the part could be the fault of how the writers have envisioned Anne, but I would be remiss in not pointing out that Colman does absolutely nothing to transcend the problem or breath any semblance of dignity into the role. Her Anne is merely a plot contrivance to set up the rivalry between the real leads - Stone and Weisz - and then retire to the sidelines to marinate in her own apathy and weakness. Not a fan of her work here at all.Although the advertising for this film includes some savage one-liners, the film is almost devoid of comedy. Certainly the latter half is no laughing matter. The depressing climax which finds Anne duped into ostracizing Sarah (and her husband) into outright exile, Anne being felled by a crippling stroke which makes her more of an emotionally unstable infant than before, and Abigail realizing that her role as a favorite (including pleasuring the Queen in a dead-eyed manner) is not all it was cracked up to be, will leave no one skipping out in high spirits. A real desperate miss here.",3,3,6,26 April 2019
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Total dreck
","After the success of both the book and film of the original Jurassic Park, it was a no-brainer that there would be a sequel. There were many directions that such a sequel could go, but Michael Crichton's intent to 'cash in' was made evident when he not only stole the title of an Arthur Conan Doyle dinosaur story to christen his sequel, but pretty much recycled the story from the original with minimal revisions. He even stooped low enough to revive the character of Ian Malcolm from the dead and hope no one who read the original novel noticed. Spielberg apparently knows he is dealing with crap, so while he keeps the bare bones of the Crichton sequel, he throws in everything but the kitchen sink in an effort to inspire some form of excitement. Apparently there is a second island on which millionaire Richard Attenborough was breeding dinosaurs, which is now in danger of being plundered by his greedy nephew (Arliss Howard channeling Snidely Whiplash) and a group of hunters (led by an overacting Pete Postlethwaite). Sensibly, Attenborough turns for help to Jeff Goldblum's chaos theorist Ian Malcolm, the one character he despised from the original film and the one least qualified to lead such a venture. Yet because Goldblum was an entertaining and popular supporting character, there needed to be some thin reason to bump him to lead (Sam Neill and Laura Dern are sorely missed). Naturally, there is no reason for him to accept, but the plot conveniently gives him a paleontologist girlfriend (Julianne Moore), who is already on the island. This motley gang is completed by an oafish Vince Vaughn, dead meat character Richard Schiff and Goldblum's stowaway teenage daughter (the sublimely talentless Vanessa Lee Chester, who is excess baggage until her 'big' moment when a velocirapter kindly stands still long enough for her to execute ludicrously complicated gymnastic moves to knock it through a window). It is hard to understand what this group hopes to accomplish against the far better organized hunting party, and indeed they accomplish nothing other than to place themselves in one degree of danger after another through chronic stupidity. Are we really to believe that Moore's character who has successfully lived on this island for weeks without incident is now capable of making the number of disastrous lapses in judgment that even a third-grade Boy Scout would avoid? The special effects are spectacular, but the characters are so thinly conceived and obnoxious that they fail to even register as the 'types' presented in the original film. Goldblum's elevation to leading status here is also a misconception - for 2+ hours he kvetches, he moans, he wrings his hands, he rattles off criminally unfunny gag lines, and basically demonstrates why this character was better used in support. Departing completely from the novel, the concluding moments attempt to drum up suspense by bringing a T-Rex to San Diego (not exactly an exciting landmark city!) to run amok. Amazingly, the T-Rex devours the entire crew of the boat carrying it to San Diego, and then locks itself back in the hold. The carnage in San Diego is almost lackluster and relegated to the T-Rex chasing some Japanese tourists and devouring a family dog in front of a caricaturish yuppie couple and their rather underwhelmed tot, before conscientiously returning to the hold of the boat to do away with the asinine cardboard villain. The visual effects are terrific, but the same cannot be said of the acting, writing, editing or direction, which is incredibly uneven and unfocused for Spielberg. A total mess.",3,2,11,7 March 2008
Schindler's List," Just misses being a masterpiece thanks to sledgehammer climax
","Schindler's List is one of Steven Spielberg's first 'serious' Oscar-bait attempts and it is a superb (near flawless) piece of film-making up to a point. Spielberg has chosen to relate the horrors of the Holocaust through the biographical story of businessman Oskar Schindler. Schindler was an opportunist who decided to exploit the Jews affected by Hitler's final solution and utilize them in his factory. As he witnessed first-hand the repercussions of the Holocaust, he gradually began to take active efforts to save the 1100 Jews in his employ by literally buying their lives. Spielberg's stark black-and-white photography enhances the realism of the film and he directs the material with a refreshing no-frills approach. Spielberg is usually known to be a very sentimental director and what is astonishing about his work for much of the film is how cool and unsentimental it is. This is not an insult, the approach works wonders. He let's the tension and the terror of what unfolds speak for itself without embellishing with tired Hollywood clichés and intrusions. Liam Neeson's performance as Schindler is nuanced, enigmatic and entrancing. He is a person that one never truly gets to know, but his evolution from unconcerned businessman to one who in a sweaty frenzy tries to beat the clock to remember all of the names of his employees in order to save their lives is amazing acting. Spielberg and Neeson never try to turn Schindler into a saint and we get a warts-and-all central character. Ralph Fiennes is also astounding as the thoroughly amoral Amon Goeth and Ben Kingsley contributes one of his finest restrained performances as foreman Itzhak Stern. I also found Embeth Davidtz moving in the peripheral role of Helen Hirsch, a young Jewish woman who becomes the beleaguered object of affection for both Goeth and Schindler. The film is required viewing for anyone interested in history, the Holocaust or simply masterful film-making. In fact, the only thing that prevents me from ranking the film at its highest level is its conclusion. Spielberg in his latter years seems to have a problem with providing satisfying codas to his films  the more serious ones provide the greater difficulties. Schindler's List is no exception and I believe that he panders in the final few moments and fails to accept the intelligence of his audience for processing what went before. He has just crafted a perfect account of the events and torn our hearts out in the process  viewers are fully able to comprehend the depth of the accomplishments of Schindler. However, Spielberg seems to feel we need a refresher course. He adds a totally unneeded closing where the real surviving Schindler Jews and their offspring march side-by-side across the screen (all the better to marvel over their numbers) and pay tribute at Schindler's grave. While I must say I was mildly interested in seeing the modern-day equivalents of some of the characters I had just seen on screen, it was like a subtle, insightful film suddenly brandishing a sledgehammer and adopting a totally different approach to make its point. Still, just in case any is still slow on Schindler's accomplishments as a savior, Spielberg then literally types it out for us to remind us exactly how many were saved and how many offspring from future generations have been saved by Schindler's selfless efforts. I really found this drawn-out and needless climax to shatter the mood generated by the earlier portions of the film and it prevents me from rating this a masterpiece.",8,4,12,3 January 2007
The Mist," A promising effort that derails completely
","I freely admit that I was a fan of the original novella on which this film was based. It has widely been considered one of the best stories in the Stephen King pantheon and there were a variety of rumors circling for years of prominent filmmakers promising to adapt it to the screen. After two successful prior King efforts, writer/director Frank Darabont seemed a promising choice, but there turn out to be problems with this choice. Darabont is a wonderful director with intimate character-driven stories, which was shown to good effect in both The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile. However, Shawshank was a straightforward drama. The Green Mile, despite some elements of the supernatural woven into the plot, was anything but a horror film. Darabont tries his first shot at one of King's out-and-out horror stories and the result is a bust. A situation made unfortunate by both the promise of the set-up and the people involved. King's novella focused on a group of people who endure a freakishly severe storm and then take refuge in a local grocery store as a mysterious mist closes in bringing assorted horrors with it. While King's source story had its ragged spots, it worked well as an in-your-face scare story with an ambiguous ending. By contrast, Darabont ultimately wants the film to be something a lot more than what the story was, so instead of a rousing jump-out-of-your-seat scare film, we get a patchy social commentary. The end result is unevenly paced and packs a lot less impact than had Darabont just gone ahead and filmed the thriller aspects as the focus. Instead, we get a couple of mildly suspenseful encounters with assorted creatures (rendered with mixed results by CGI) and far too many scenes of tense human confrontations within the store that veer from sweaty whispering to over-the-top shrill shouting, none of which are a fraction as fascinating or insightful as Darabont apparently believes. The cast is made up of solid, reliable actors, which largely do well with their roles. Thomas Jane is a handsome and talented actor, but he is still waiting for his breakout role, and this is not it. He elicits sympathy as the focal character, a father concerned with the safety of his young son and the wife that he left back at home, and wisely eschews overdoing the action elements. The only time his performance fails to ring true are during his final histrionic moments. Laurie Holden is appealing, but does not have a lot to do here. Better still are Toby Jones and Frances Sternhagen (the latter largely underused). By contrast, the only major acting misstep comes from Marcia Gay Harden chomping the scenery as a borderline psychotic religious fanatic who makes matters worse inside the market. While I find the character largely believable (let's face it, people like this are becoming more and more common in the world), a little bit of her goes a long way and a character that felt like a supporting role in the novella seems expanded on film beyond reason to promote Darabont's new social commentary designs. Arguably the saddest part about the film is that it does succeed in a modest way until its final moments blow it completely out of the water, much in the way that the film Blow Out fell apart in its final moments, when its lead character acted in a totally incoherent and inappropriate way. While I have nothing against films, particularly horror films, having downbeat endings, it needs to grow naturally from the story and not seem to be there only to shock. The final moments of the film find a handful of the survivors fleeing the grocery store lest they become sacrifices for the religious fanatics and making a run for freedom in their car. A scant few minutes later they decide to commit suicide en masse, with Jane's father shooting his young son in the head, only to have...wait for it...the US army roll by a few moments later appearing to successfully drive off any monsters with their tanks and flame-throwers. So, in other words, any characters that have generated rooting interest end up dead as basically a punchline. Unlike a thriller like Seven, where the shocking conclusion seemed appropriate and to add to the film, The Mist serves up a pitch black ending that ultimately serves no purpose, seems tacked on, and features characters acting in ways completely at odds with their personalities. Why leave the store at all? They could have surrendered themselves to the fanatics and it would have made more logical sense. And having the army roll through to save the day sheer moments later in a perverse gotcha incredibly draws more attention to the stupidity of it all. Some viewers at my screening actually burst out laughing at how inane it was, which I hardly think is the reaction Darabont was hoping for here. Unfortunately, the ending has the tendency to tarnish any of the successful elements that happened before and leaves a really bad taste. It is ironic they chose this route along with a Thanksgiving/Christmas release time because I was completely at sea as to who they thought would give this climax good word of mouth - and judging from the dismal box office returns, apparently it was no one.",3,6,13,17 March 2008
Call Me by Your Name," Beautiful snoozefest
","With critics and film afficionados inventing new superlatives to describe it, I really want to love this film. Cinema needed a new entry in gay romance that could take its place alongside Brokeback Mountain. Alas, this is not it.Set in the 1980s, the story centers on the summer love affair that develops between 17-year-old Elio (Timothee Chalamet) and visiting grad student Oliver (Armie Hammer), who shows up to assist Elio's professor dad at their idyllic Italian villa. The film touches on all the pitfalls and heightened emotions of first love between two erudite and well-spoken guys. The parents are present throughout, but pretty much leave Elio to his own devices, to write his music, read and fantasize. The film largely has two things going for it. First is the beautiful photography. Everything looks lush and intoxicating - the villa, the quaint Italian villages, and gorgeous scenery. Second is Chalamet's lead performance. He disappears into the role of Elio - never for one moment do we not believe that this is who he is. The intelligence, the emotion, all are genuine. Although not a fan of the film, I think this performance is easily better than Gary Oldman's bring-out-the-latex Winston Churchill that took the Best Actor award this year. It will be interesting to see if Chalamet can maintain the acting momentum in his next roles.That said, the film is well over two hours and does not merit that length by a long shot. As beautiful as the scenery can be, director Luca Guadagnino spends absurd amounts of time focusing endlessly on fountains and streets and trees to the point where one wants to shout at the screen to get on with it already. While establishing the scene is important, a little less of Elio's parents and visitors having long-winded philosophical conversations to hammer home the point that we are walking among brilliant, high-minded individuals would also have been welcome. It truly seems forever for the leads to acknowledge their attraction and act on it, and that is the crux of the film.A big failure is that every great love story needs chemistry. As terrific as Chalamet is in bringing his character to life on screen, he cannot generate any chemistry with co-star Hammer. In my mind, Hammer suffers from something I tend to call 'The Idris Elba Syndrome' in that everyone keeps stressing what a fantastic and charismatic performer he is and I really want to like him, but I find him more often than not stiff and uninvolving. Here is no exception. I give him credit for taking on what is apparently still a stigma of playing a gay role, but there is not an ounce of chemistry with Chalamet. While physically Hammer fits the bill of the glamorous movie star-like American visitor (I keep waiting for him to reach under the table and bring up a box of toothpaste to shill) that is about all he brings here. He looks a bit long in tooth to be a 25-year-old grad student. He keeps referring to working on papers and is given a moment to wow us with his intellect wherein he corrects Elio's dad on something - but the dialogue seems unbelievable coming out of his mouth. He captivates all the young women in town who gaze at him adoringly on the dance floor and discuss his prowess as a dancer - another laughable moment since Hammer looks more like someone suffering palsy than dancing. Worst of all, in the romantic moments, he is stiff, stiff, stiff. We know ahead of time that Oliver and Elio will eventually part at the end of summer, but we should not already be acknowledging that Elio can do better.Another problem is how staid the film is given its purported bona fides as being an 'erotic' tale of first love. The much-ballyhooed notorious peach scene seems more American Pie-ish than erotic. When Elio and Oliver finally have their first love scene, the camera moves from the still partially clothes actors to a minute-and-a-half stationary shot of a tree outside the window. Really? If the actors and/or the director were this timid, why not just fade to black rather than have a lengthy shot of a tree? If any film called out for some degree of nudity, it is this one, but all we get is brief or blink-and-you'll miss it shots. Chalamet briefly bares his rear walking into the bathroom to change. You would need a bionic eye to catch a split second shot of Hammer pulling up his bathing trunks, while his only other revealing scene takes place in such darkness by a window that it could be Kate Smith standing there. Ironically, we get more skin from a topless supporting actress in a tete-a-tete with Elio. The male nudity in this film could easily have passed unedited in a PG-rated film - I am pretty sure Cops and Robbersons had more lengthy nudity. Producer/writer James Ivory complained to the press about the timidity of American actors and their refusal to do frontal or casual nude scenes when the material called for it - and he has a point here. Perhaps at least Hammer's role should have gone to a European actor that could assimilate an American accent. As it stands, instead of eroticism, we get a rather staid and dull series of coyly filmed encounters - and let's not forget that tree!By the end, I was struggling to stay awake and actually was mentally urging Elio and Oliver to part. Michael Stuhlbarg as Elio's dad gets an inspiring speech at the end, but you may well have wished the film ended a good thirty minutes previously. I am all for further explorations into gay romance and look forward to them, but I certainly hope that they are more successful than Call Me By Your Name. Perhaps in another 10-20 years someone will remake this effort with a bit of a pulse. It would be hard to better Chalamet, but the inclusion of a mannequin in Hammer's role may be an improvement. I know people love this film, but this was a really sad miss for me.",4,6,22,2 June 2018
The Hurt Locker," Underwhelming and empty exercise
","Despite the critical accolades showered on this film, it seems hard to take its Best Picture Oscar seriously in light of its amazing competition - pretty much all of which succeeded far better in their respective goals. I had the pleasure (or displeasure) to watch the film with my cousin - an Afghanistan and Iraq War veteran. He was already picking apart the film's much-heralded 'authenticity' before the first 30 minutes were up and stalked out in a huff after 1.25 hour never to return. Some of the errors I would not have noted without him; others were so glaring that the viewer would need to be headless to overlook the illogic. Given that this film's 'realism' was one of the trumps critics and fans were citing, it was a bit of a surprise that such could be so easily dismissed. The story - such as it is - focuses on an EOD team in Iraq having to contend with reckless loose cannon Jeremy Renner. Renner is quite good in the role - the writing and the film itself are not up his level. Much ink has been spilled about Kathryn Bigelow becoming the first Oscar-winning female director. I think this moment should have come sooner, but not with Bigelow. From the start, critics have invented superlatives to describe Bigelow's resume, but I thought she was a hack when she made the cult film Near Dark and her subsequent entries like Strange Days, Point Break, K-19:The Widowmaker, etc., have not changed my opinion. She combines all of the worst aspects of macho-man male directors without any mitigating factors. It is not a compliment to say that any of Bigelow's films - including this one - could have been made by a run-of-the-mill male action director. Bigelow consistently sacrifices logic and coherence for the next big bang or money shot. Arguably, my biggest annoyance is what is missing from the film. Agree or disagree on the Iraq War, but no one can dispute that it is one of the most controversial political events in U.S. history. A pre-emptive war initiated by the U.S. on trumped up evidence against a country that posed no legitimate threat and which repercussions are still thundering throughout the U.S. and the Mid-East. A really amazing film could (and should) be made on exploring such fall-out. How ironic then that the first award-winning film to set itself during the war has absolutely no view on it whatsoever. The characters we meet have little to contribute on what or who they are fighting. It is little more than a glorified testosterone-fueled action film with nothing to say about much of anything. Unless, of course, one takes a cynical approach and assumes that Bigelow and company's point is that we should thank goodness for endless warfare or else what would men like Renner's character - who are ill-suited for either family life or contributing to peaceful society on a daily basis - possibly have to do with themselves. Strangely that does seem to be the theme of her film and it is as disheartening and wearisome as her direction. One also trembles to think that now that Bigelow has made such an uncontroversial film on such a controversial subject and given the approach such cache, how many directors will now inundate us with films set in the Iraq War (a la Vietnam) that will also have absolutely nothing of interest to say?",5,2,5,20 September 2010
Mulholland Drive," Near masterpiece that degenerates into an incoherent mess
","The first two-thirds of this film feature some of the best directing David Lynch has ever done. Aspiring starlet Naomi Watts arrives in Hollywood to stay in her aunt's apartment and discovers amnesiac Lara Elena Harring taking refuge there. In between auditions, Watts assists Harring in getting to the bottom of the accident that left her with amnesia and the identity of the shadowy people pursuing her. Various other subplots encircle the central thread including a perky landlady, a cuckolded director and a police investigation. The film is alternately surreal, darkly humorous and creepy. Watts, in particular, is magnificent in a breakthrough role as the inquisitive starlet. She is incredibly appealing, gutsy and sexy. Unfortunately, the latter third of the film collapses in on itself into an incoherent and ludicrous jumble of death, lesbianism, logic loopholes and loose ends, with Lynch repeating many of the same plot contrivances that he perpetrated in the equally incoherent Lost Highways. It is rare to see such a promising and deftly rendered production take such an immediate and sharp downward spiral. Part of the problem could conceivably be that the film was initially intended as the pilot for a TV series that was not picked up. Lynch then tacked on a crummy non-conclusion filled with gratuitous sex, nudity and violence, which fails to answer any of the mysteries presented in the early passages and nicely sabotages the fine performances.",5,1,3,29 December 2006
The Piano," Beautifully photographed art house drivel
","Since The Piano, writer/director Jane Campion's star has understandably dimmed and it is not hard to see why when viewing this heralded 'success' from early in her career. Beautifully photographed and bizarre to a fault, The Piano exhibits much of Campion's excesses at their worst. Mute mail order bride Holly Hunter travels with illegitimate daughter Anna Paquin to meet new husband Sam Neill in 1850s New Zealand. They get off on the wrong foot immediately when Neill does not bring enough men to transport the huge and unexpected piano that Hunter brings with her from their disembarking point on the beach. The piano is subsequently claimed by a half-Maori neighbor (Harvey Keitel), with whom Hunter ends up bartering sexually for its return, much to the chagrin of her cuckolded new husband. Campion definitely gets points for originality, but then most of her work is nothing if not original. Incredibly the film was embraced by many as a sort of pseudo-feminist tale, but one really has to stretch it to envision that. Yes, Hunter's Ada exerts her power to deprive her new husband of her favors after the abandonment of her precious piano, but she is also presented as a neglectful mother, a casual whore, self-destructively suicidal, and a rather nasty and obnoxious all-around individual. All things that should make her a fascinating cinematic study, so it is then a mystery as to why she is so dreadfully uninteresting and tedious. We never really get insight into her character and her actions in the final moments with the piano are impenetrable from any standpoint. This leaves a veritable hole right at the center of the film, and we never understand the obsession that the others harbor for her. The film is beautifully shot and scored, and one must applaud Campion for not dulling down the erotic aspects of the film. Keitel (cast against type) and Neill do fairly well, but it would have been interesting to see them switch roles to see if this improved the sluggish chemistry or not. Paquin performs capably as the neglected young daughter prone to wild storytelling. Many have gone overboard in heaping praise on Hunter's work as the mute central character, but I find her quite unappealing and overrated here. Depriving Hunter of her ear-shattering Texas twang actually helps make her performance easier to give as at least vocally she does not have to convince us as a woman of the period. However, the remainder of her performance is basically summed up by many stern looks and a couple of tantrums where she throws things around (while giving further stern looks). Her one-note effort could be a main reason while Ada fails to connect in any meaningful way, at least with this viewer. Incredibly, for a film with a feminist reputation, both the lead character and the film in general are incredibly misogynistic, proving that one need not be male to be sexist. By the time the film crawls to its conclusion, you may well have wished you had not joined Hunter and company on her voyage.",4,5,9,7 March 2008
Clash of the Titans," Fertile ground for a remake generates very uneven results
","In the eternal remake mill of Hollywood, it was by no means a bad idea to remake the 1981 action spectacle Clash of the Titans, which was a flawed, but fun epic that functioned as stop-motion special effects legend Ray Harryhausen's last hurrah. It is still fun, but one would need to be blind not to notice that the special effects are showing their age and that a good deal of entertainment stems from watching the cast of aging European acting nobility spouting bad dialog.This Clash of the Titans keeps the bare bones of the original story with hero Perseus, the son of king of the gods Zeus, pressed into service to lead an expedition to save Princess Andromeda from being sacrificed to the dreaded sea Kraken.This Clash is neither cheesy nor lacking in big budget effects, but it definitely lacks fun. The adventures of Greek mythology are a treasure trove for filmmakers and they have an entire new generation completely unfamiliar with them, so it seems strange that it is rarely revisited. One can certainly understand the intent of director Louis Letterier and the screenwriters to distance themselves from the potential camp pitfalls of the original and imbue some level of seriousness to the proceedings, I sincerely doubt that the end result should be this listless.Most of the issues stem from the screenplay. The changes/flourishes they have added to this remake are ill-conceived and seriously hamper being engaged in the film. One of the biggest problems lies in a rather foolish change made in the dynamics of the relationship between Perseus and Andromeda. In the original film, they were romantic foils and Perseus had a definite stake in whether or not Andromeda was spared her fate. In the remake, Perseus (Sam Worthington) and Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) are barely nodding acquaintances. Perseus undergoes the journey largely because he is annoyed with the gods and Andromeda stays behind continuing ministering to the beleaguered citizens of Argos as some sort of Mother Teresa figure. It is a bizarre change which robs the story of any sense of urgency. If the leading man has no particular stake in the outcome, there is something missing.For a romantic foil, the writers have added a new character named Io (Gemma Arterton), who was cursed by the gods to never age. For some reason, she takes a shine to Perseus and accompanies him on the journey as some kind of consultant. The character is fairly nonsensical and the film really assigns little time for anything that resembles romance, so the infatuation that develops between the characters is fairly mundane.The protagonists have also changed to some extent. Whereas in the original, Andromeda was to be sacrificed because her vain mother offended the sensibilities of the goddess Thetis, Hades is rather unimaginatively made the villain of the piece. Indeed the goddesses of Olympus, often a force to be reckoned with in their own right, are largely forgotten in this film.The film is decidedly grittier than the original, completely lacking in the magical visual splendors of its predecessor. It does not even look particularly enticing with many sequences oddly drained of color. It is also lacking in suspense. The sequence in Medusa's lair – a highlight in the original – is strangely missing any element of tension here. And isn't it a bit dumb that everyone except Perseus succumbs on this journey? While there were a number of deaths in the original, the entire party was not annihilated.While the cheese factor on Mount Olympus has been minimized, it somehow does not seem an improvement. Liam Neeson, who seems be trapped in these roles now, is rather dully cast as Zeus. The only other god of note is Hades, played by a tiresome hissing Ralph Fiennes. Back on terra firma, the cast does not have it much better. Gemma Arterton is lovely, but her role is ill-defined and ultimately pointless. Jason Flemyng is predictably hammy as the disfigured villain Calibos. Davalos fails to make much impression as Andromeda, who always seems to hover just outside of the action. Any fanboys hoping for a redux of the infamous nude bath sequence from the original with Judi Bowker are destined for disappointment.There is no question that Sam Worthington – fresh from the success of Avatar – contributes a better performance than Harry Hamlin. Hamlin's pecs and hair seemed to be doing all of the heavy lifting, but Hamlin was also surrounded by a better production. Worthington has the correct physicality and he sure looks nice in a skirt, but the screenplay has turned Perseus into such a one-note dour sort. He only embarks on the quest to thumb his nose at the gods and spends most of the film slapping away any help provided by his father. Defiance seems to be the character's only characteristic, which hogties Worthington acting-wise. With a better screenplay, he may have rocked the part.In the end this is little more than another missed opportunity. There are a couple of highlights, such as the scorpion battle and the climactic appearance of the Kraken, but these were done better in the original. Similarly, any of the new elements that the filmmakers thought would make things more interesting, more often than not, fall flat. I do like that Pegasus is a sleek black horse rather than the traditional white.I gather a sequel is in the works. Not necessarily a bad development given that there are so many adventures that can play out from this material, but hopefully the screenwriters have learned some lessons from this effort. A word to the wise – give Worthington's Perseus more than one character trait and a stake in the outcome. And while they're at it, how about giving those goddesses on Olympus something to do as well?",Null,1,1,7 September 2011
Mission: Impossible II," Laughably incompetent
","While I was not a fan of the initial overrated film adaptation of the popular TV series, the discovery that new director John Woo was taking over the helm made me decide to give this sequel a chance. Unfortunately, the end result is a laughably incompetent action film. Between this and the equally lamentable Broken Arrow, I am at a loss as to why Woo has any reputation in Hollywood. Tom Cruise returns as IMF agent Ethan Hunt, who matches wits with terrorist Dougray Scott who plans to release a biotoxin in Australia. Ving Rhames returns as Cruise's able-bodied co-hort and Thandie Newton is along for the ride as the token love interest - a cat burglar and former girlfriend to Scott. The screenplay is haphazardly plotted and not especially interesting or suspenseful. There are so many sequences of people ripping off their faces to reveal that they are in reality someone else completely that the effect long since loses any relevance. It also introduces a rather obvious issue that if the person you are impersonating looks to be 6'3' and you look to be 5'6' in height why does no one wonder why you have suddenly shrunk? Cruise spends the film glowering, showing off his athletic prowess by doing back flips at the drop of a hat and glaring intently at Newton in a desperate attempt to convince that they have chemistry. Although Scott seems a physical match for Cruise, he is one of the more boring villains in recent memory. Woo directs scenes between Newton/Cruise and Newton/Scott as though he were filming a Calvin Klein ad with endlessly arty filtered shots of blowing scarves and swirling images that nearly border on lampoon. His action scenes definitely qualify for lampoon with the adversaries flying through the air, smashing into solid objects at ridiculous speeds with nary an injury and assorted Road Runner-esqe foolishness that inspires far more titters than adrenaline. The end result is a laughably tedious exercise not worth anyone's time.",2,1,3,9 April 2010
The Dark Knight," Spectacular sequel , although the fun has left the building
","Director Christopher Nolan defies the odds and crafts a sequel that surpasses the original. In short, this becomes The Godfather-Part II of comic book movies and establishes a new parameter that others that follow will be judged - perhaps a bit too harshly.Gotham City's march toward the light is bolstered by the efforts of nighttime vigilante hero Batman and by idealistic crusading district attorney Harvey Dent, but their efforts are undermined by the appearance of a brilliant anarchist known only as the Joker, whose diabolical attacks have a tendency to expose the seamy underside of many of Gotham's citizens.The film unfolds like a labyrinthine crime epic, with a multitude of supporting players and wide-ranging locales. This offers a dynamic landscape and an unpredictable quality to the production that is riveting. Nolan's direction is expert.Once again, he demonstrates a fine feel for character development and how to have action spring naturally from the proceedings rather than feeling inserted. The film is incredibly exciting in some stretches and never less than thought-provoking in others.Christian Bale returns triumphantly as Batman/Bruce Wayne. He still creates an appealing, multi-layered hero, but the real dominant element this time around is the story. Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman are all back and in top form. Oldman, especially, continues to find new terrain in a character all but reduced to nothingness in earlier incarnations.The film gets a lot of mileage out of two new additions. It took some real chutzpah to use the Joker in this film - a role which was virtually owned by Jack Nicholson in 1989s Batman. When word came that Heath Ledger was cast in the part, jaws dropped at the lunacy. Amazingly, it became the performance of the year and left people wondering Jack Who? Ledger's approach to the Joker is almost a polar opposite to Nicholson and it not only works - but succeeds gangbusters. We learn almost nothing about this character and Nolan uses him only as much as he needs to, but every moment he steps on screen it becomes impossible to tear your eyes away. Ledger crafts a character of maniacal brilliance. This is truly a chilling character for the ages and the posthumous Oscar was more than deserved.By contrast, Aaron Eckhart gets far less credit for his turn, but he also creates a compelling character in the upright, yet morally flawed Harvey Dent - destined by tragedy and chance to become the unbalanced Two-Face. The film sets up his character as the emotional soul of the new Gotham and then puts him through the ringer. Eckhart is appealing and charismatic as the righteous Dent hinting at shades of gray beneath the surface. Later, he cuts a dramatic and sympathetic figure as the broken former hero of the people whose spirit and psyche become casualties of the Joker's manipulations. A further thumbs up to the convincing make-up for Eckhart's late film transformation as well, which is far more amazing than anything handed to Tommy Lee Jones in Batman Forever.What prevents me from rating the film as a perfect 10 are two quibbles. One minor and one not so minor.Once again, the character of Rachel Dawes is a stumbling block here. The critically drubbed Katie Holmes from the original has been replaced by Maggie Gyllenhaal. Although I found Holmes lacking, I will chance being in the minority here when I say Gyllenhaal is not an improvement. The character remains a wet blanket, but this time she gets an entire subplot - a romantic triangle with both Bale and Eckhart. Like Holmes, Gyllenhaal is not remotely convincing as an attorney and shares no chemistry with Bale (nor Eckhart). However, Holmes at least brought some sex appeal to the part - Gyllenhaal by comparison seems downright pallid and often uncomfortable. She gives us no good reason why the two most eligible bachelors in Gotham City would be even minimally interested in her - much less entranced. When she keeps going back and forth between the two men, she brings all of the emotional heft of a woman deciding her grocery list. As such, the romantic subplot is a washout and lacks the emotional punch needed in the later moments.Some of the late plot twists are a bit overly manipulative. The film's insistence to turn Batman through circumstance and by his own martyrdom into a tragic pariah in the final scenes smacks of needless melodrama. The characters and film's insistence that Gotham City could not stand to know the truth about the deterioration of Harvey Dent seems a manufactured philosophical crisis that comes out of left field. Truthfully, the citizens of Gotham are oddly fickle and cynical, and we have only the pontificating of the heroes rather than anything concrete that we have seen that forces the final conclusions drawn by those on screen. So while the ending has a certain power, there are far too many mental and emotional jumps required by the players to realize it, and even then it is not 100 percent convincing.Yet I feel that the film's biggest flaw is that one would think no matter how serious the proceedings, a film based on a comic book should have some elements of fun. As amazing as all of Nolan's accomplishments are, this film is not a fun watch by any stretch - it is dark, despairing, emotionally wrenching, often nasty, unpredictable and ingenious. However, the fun element is completely A.W.O.L. As such, while I stand in awe of its successes, I could easily go 10 years without wanting to sit through it again, which I am pretty certain is not the hallmark of a perfect film.",Null,0,1,19 July 2011
Avatar," Visually astounding and emotionally compelling
","There comes a moment about two-thirds of the way into Avatar. The medicine woman of the Na'avi, wonderfully interpreted by CCH Pounder, watches as the home which has housed her tribe for generations is obliterated by the corporation mercenaries out for the ore that lies beneath it. She lets out a howl of anguish and the look on her face is the pure stunned horror of one seeing their dreams and heritage destroyed in one fell swoop. It is at that moment that I realized that James Cameron had succeeded and had not only drawn me into his story, not just visually, but emotionally, and had managed to make a strange race of blue aliens vibrantly accessible and credible beings. Visually the film is beyond critique. It succeeds beautifully in whisking one away to a world that heretofore could only have been imagined and, even then very limitedly. The film opens with former Marine Jake Sully pressed into service to step in for his deceased brother to utilize an avatar - a DNA-mixed hybrid of human and Na'avi - to attempt to learn what he can about the natives of the planet Pandora, who are proving problematic to the corporation and their hired gun mercenaries who wish to exploit the planet for their gain. He agrees to spy for gung-ho military overseer Quaritch, but ostensibly answers to scientist Grace Augustine who supervises the project. Despite his initial reluctance, Jake integrates into a tribe of Na'avi and learns to love his life in the avatar, and the humble lifestyle of the Na'avi as well. The planet Pandora is character onto itself - a stunning vista that seems constantly alive with vibrance, light and motion. Cameron has cast the film perfectly as well. Sam Worthington is restrained enough to be the perfect conduit for the viewer to enter Pandora, yet charismatic enough to be the kind of leader that one could believe in. Zoe Saldana amazingly interprets the Na'avi princess making her an inspirational character. Supporting roles are ably filled by Stephen Lang as a hissable villain, Sigourney Weaver in a wonderful turn as Dr. Augustine and Michelle Rodriguez, finally in an appealing role. A lot of criticism has been directed at the dialog, but any writing major can tell you that a screenplay is much more than dialog. It is primarily structure and Avatar is structured brilliantly - further none of the dialog rings hollow to my ears. Quaritch and company may be a bit one-track, but one would also be lying if they denied that their real life counterparts are easy to point out. Similarly, the dialog sounds fine to my ears - scientists talk like I imagine scientists to talk like (when an injured Weaver rouses herself enough to muse 'I need to take samples' - it feels right!), military talk like what I have heard military talk like, and the dialog between Jake and the Na'avi seems to me unpretentious and works all the better because of that approach. I have heard rumblings of a sequel, but they really should not proceed down that line as this story concludes on a perfect note and needs no further expansion. I look forward to visiting Pandora and its denizens many times in the future, but at my movieplex or home video screen, not in a sequel. Avatar is a visually astounding and emotionally compelling film experience worth the ride.",10,3,6,2 February 2010
Mission: Impossible," A rather dull adaptation
","Film adaptations of beloved TV shows are a dime a dozen and it is not hard to determine the diamonds (The Untouchables, The Fugitive, Charlie's Angels) from the lumps of coal (pretty much everything else). Given that Brian DePalma is the guiding force behind The Untouchables and the very structure of the TV show Mission: Impossible opens many avenues that one could explore with a large budget, a talented cast and the big screen, one certainly can be forgiven for keeping an open mind. Unfortunately, the end result is roughly 1-2 large scale action sequences surrounded by pure tedium. There is a lot of blame to go around for the end result, which burned up the box office and inspired two sequels (so far), but rarely if ever gets a mention on anyone's lists of favorite summer blockbusters. First, the storyline and characters are thoroughly uninteresting. For some reason known only to the screenwriters, the focal character is someone completely new, while the Jim Phelps character who led the TV series is shunted into support. The film allows absolutely no time to get a feel for the IMF team and how they work as our initial introduction to them is during a mission that turns into a disaster, leaving the majority of the team dead due to an obvious traitor. Naturally, the powers that be assume the traitor is the 'lone survivor' (Tom Cruise), but we subsequently learn that another team member survived the melee (Emmanuelle Beart), so the two go on the run to steal a list of covert agents from the government to draw out a spy kingpin, who they hope will force the hand of the traitor and expose him/her (or some such thing). Like the TV show, there are a few twists and turns, double-crosses and reversals. Unlike the TV show, none of them are particularly surprising or involving. The cast looks better on paper than its plays out on screen. Kristin Scott-Thomas and Emilio Estevez are in the film for barely more than an eye blink before being dispatched. Lead Cruise is certainly up to the physical challenges of the role, but gives us no good reason to root for his character. He spends much of the film either blank-faced or glowering. Beart, as his co-hort and potential love interest, is lovely but listless. Jon Voight takes on the Jim Phelps role and pretty much contributes the same dull auto-pilot performance that he has reserved for his roles in popular entertainment for the last 20 years. Jean Reno is wasted as a later addition to Cruise's team, while Ving Rhames gets fed what few good lines there are and attempts to appear intimidating. Henry Czerny trots out a slightly starchier version of the uptight government official that he played in Clear and Present Danger. Meanwhile, more discerning viewers wait for the far-too-brief appearances of Vanessa Redgrave, who manages without breaking a sweat to make her fellow cast members appear laughable by comparison. DePalma, once known for some incredible set pieces, provides the film with stillborn pacing. He ratchets up the adrenaline in the final act in and on top of a speeding train, but prior to that we get one mildly amusing set piece with Cruise attempting a theft while suspended above the floor in a government building. Unfortunately, the scene goes on and on and on and on, ultimately losing whatever suspense and originality it may have initially possessed. These elements all culminate in a promising concept that misses its potential.",4,1,4,12 June 2009
War of the Worlds," Not perfect, but a still rewarding experience
","Interestingly, War of the Worlds is one of the box-office hits that few people want to admit that they like. Yet even accepting its weaknesses, I enjoyed the film to a large extent. Freely adapted from H.G. Wells legendary story, it depicts the chaos that escalates in the face of a Martian invasion as seen through the eyes of regular guy Tom Cruise and his family. The opening scenes establishing the family – particularly single irresponsible divorced dad Cruise, surly teenage son Justin Chatwin and young daughter Dakota Fanning – are some of the film's weakest moments. Then all hell breaks loose and director Steven Spielberg demonstrates that he is one of the best purveyors of well-choreographed action on screen. Our first vision of the Martian tripods rising doom-like from the ground to start its rampage amidst a horrifying cacophony of alien sound is truly a terrifying moment. The uncertain journey of Cruise and his children to escape the invasion and reunite with the children's mother in Boston takes on a believably surreal quality – coupled with the fact that we truly are never certain of a positive outcome for all involved. To be sure the film suffers from problems. The mother character, briefly played by Miranda Otto, is all but forgotten for the duration of the film when one could imagine a very proactive role. The film does move in fits and starts – sometimes understandably so, other times not. A late stage segue where Cruise and company shelter from the aliens in the basement with an increasingly bizarre and unbalanced Tim Robbins seems to have an entirely different tone from what came before. It is not that Robbins is not fine in his role, so much as the subplot is jarring. A later action scene opens with Cruise running into 'old friends' who immediately become lost in the shuffle of hysteria – a development that would have been more powerful if we knew these people prior to those few moments. The visual effects and sound effects combine to make the alien horde an intimidating presence. The film's worst misstep is in the conception and portrayal of Cruise's son. Initially surly and grating, Chatwin somehow manages to only become increasingly more appalling as the film progresses. Rather than step up to the plate in the face of this apocalypse unfolding and take responsibility for his sister, particularly in light of the disdain for which he holds his father, the son can think of nothing better than trying to ditch his family at the first opportunity and strike out on his own. The film screeches to a halt every time Chatwin has one of his tantrums to the point that we honestly do not understand why Cruise tolerates it since it places them all at risk. Bad writing and acting come together in this one character, which incredibly Spielberg and company actually seem to believe we have a vested interest in. Dakota Fanning fares better as the daughter, although her shrill screaming will doubtless start to wear on the viewer after a while. She does, however, share a touching moment with Cruise late in the film where she asks him to sing her a lullaby for comfort and he embarrassingly realizes that he does not know any and launches into a tearful 'Little Deuce Coupe.' Cruise makes an effective leading man. Rabid detractors seem wholly unwilling to forgive Cruise for his jumping up and down on TV and adhering to Scientology (while many of the same hypocritically give Mel Gibson a pass on far worse foolishness), but I think it is well past time that everyone acknowledge what was fairly well known previously in that Cruise is a solid and reliable actor and more than holds his own anchoring big budget films. The climax is a problem. The film conclusion - taken straight from Wells - does not easily lend itself well to cinema – in that it is hardly an edge-of-your-seat prospect that the aliens are done in by the common cold. As a side note, Morgan Freeman's opening and closing narration, which praises the wisdom of God for such 'protection' from the invaders, seems a bit fatuous when one must also reason that God was responsible for the aliens that launched this rampage. Additionally, the saccharine nature of the ending with Spielberg determined to give as many characters a 'happy ending' as possible rings completely false and somehow seems abrupt and tacked on to what went before. Yet these failings do not obscure that there are some incredibly exciting, suspenseful and tense passages in this film, and for much of it, we are in fact caught up in Cruise's plight, which makes this a far from perfect, but still rewarding sci-fi experience.",6,0,1,6 August 2009
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Atrocious!
","I adore the original classic novel by Bram Stoker and looked forward with relish to see Francis Ford Coppola's take on it, but the end result is a total disaster. Despite incorporating the author's name in the title, the end result is far from the author's original work in both tone and content. Technically, the film is beautiful. The visual effects are eye-catching, the cinematography is lush and the score is moody in a way that thoroughly evades the remainder of the film. This film adds some of the characters from the novel absent from earlier film incarnations, but as the result is irrelevancy it seems pointless. The biggest disaster is in the film's vision of Dracula. The opening attempts to tie him in with the legend of Vlad the Impaler, the inspiration for the character but something Stoker never actually did in the novel. It also introduces a 'tragic' love story completely missing from the novel and for good reason - it sucks big time. Apparently, there is some unspoken rule in vampire films now that the focal creature of the night must be a romantic figure - so instead of Stoker's vermin-like embodiment of pure evil, we end up with an undead Heathcliff. Gary Oldman, initially plastered into old man make-up and sporting a thick Romanian accent that garbles most of his lines, metamorphoses into an 18th century ZZ Top member and fails to generate either chills or elicit sympathy. Winona Ryder, as the object of his affection, has never been more ravishing, but the screenplay cannot decide whether she should be frightened or be a heroine from a grade-Z bodice-ripper, lustfully inserting 'Oh, my love' as every other line. The normally reliable Anthony Hopkins is a laughable ham as the venerable Van Helsing, and the less said about the remainder of the cast, including the hapless Keanu Reeves in a nothing part, the better. Coppola's visual style is also off-putting and takes one consistently out of the setting. Honestly, was he directing a film or an MTV video? And was that werewolf creature actually raping that woman? Ughh! By the time Ryder does a wild gypsy dance to bring on the night quicker and tearfully puts her beloved out of his misery, you are ready to drive a stake through all of them, especially the director and the screenwriter.",1,9,16,8 March 2007
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Excruciating on multiple levels
","It is nearly impossible to comprehend how a relatively durable series like Die Hard could take such a devastating crash in this third (and worst) outing. The original was an immensely enjoyable action spectacle. While the sequel lacked its predecessors intelligence, it was fast-paced and entertaining. By contrast, this latest effort is a tiresome, chaotic waste. Part of the problem is that the plot was reportedly taken from other sources and usurped by the Die Hard franchise and the shoe-horning shows. Does anyone buy for a moment that the married couple we watched in the first two films has inexplicably separated again and the heroic McClane (Bruce Willis) has turned into a washed-up embittered old drunk? The film makes a major misstep out of the starting gate by presenting a character that we are familiar with from two prior films and depicting him in a way and in a state that makes little narrative sense. The plot (such as it is) also relies heavily on coincidence, illogic motivation and general stupidity. The villain is played by Oscar-winner Jeremy Irons, who is purportedly the brother of the Alan Rickman character from the original, and who turns in a performance so dreadful it must be seen to be believed. He drops clues to various traps/bombs around NYC and has McClane and the police running frantically all over the place. In the absence of the reliable Bonnie Bedelia and Reginald Veljohnson, the plot rather incoherently conspires a reason to throw together the belabored Willis with an African-American shop owner, played by Samuel L. Jackson. Rather than amusing banter a la Lethal Weapon, we get two characters, particularly in Jackson's case, who seem to actively despise each other for the duration of the film. Worse, Jackson is portrayed as an over-the-top racist/bigot, who can barely make it through any scene without some raging anti-white sentiment amidst a flurry of foul language being unleashed. It is wearisome enough that the filmmakers actually seem to think this should be funny, but even worse it shows Jackson schooling his grandchildren in this same sort of vile outlook and tries to play it for cheap laughs. Of course, then this is used as the set-up for a predictably lazy action sequence later on which firmly highlights the film's total lack of originality. When it becomes apparent that a school is one of Irons' bombing targets, it is a foregone conclusion that the following will fall into place: a) it will be the school attended by Jackson's grandchildren, and b) there will be some ludicrous cockamamie reason why the grandchildren will be the only ones not evacuated from the school forcing a dire rescue attempt. Interestingly, the prior films in the series did provide a colorful cast of supporting characters to help/hinder the hero in his venture. Not so here, where the supporting cast is relatively interchangeable and instantly forgettable. The action sequences are utterly devoid of any tension or excitement, and the finale pretty much sputters out like a match in the wind. One can only hope that more than a decade has given the filmmakers some insight in which to improve the upcoming sequel from the debacle they hit with this one.",1,6,23,26 June 2007
"Hail, Caesar!"," Some good scenes and performances, but overall a misfire
","A film by the Coen Brothers is always worth checking out, but contrary to their reputation they can either achieve cinematic brilliance (Fargo, Blood Simple, No Country for Old Men) or excruciating lows (Intolerable Cruelty, The Big Lebowski, O Brother Where Art Thou), and a number of in-betweens. Hail, Caesar is definitely not one of their crowning achievements.The story is set in the heyday of the big Hollywood film studios and centers on studio 'fixer' wheeler-dealer Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) detailing the various fires he must put out in order to keep production rolling on some the studios future hits. Aside from the usual, Mannix must contend with the ostensible kidnapping of the studio's most popular leading man (George Clooney) from the set of a Ben-Hur style biblical epic by a cabal of Communists and ward off the machinations of twin sister gossip columnists (Tilda Swinton) on the trail of big scandals.The film should be a lot of fun. Unfortunately, it missteps entirely too often and has huge dead spots. The obvious problems with the film hit the viewer pretty quickly. Eddie Mannix was actually a real figure, but the sanitized do-gooder that we see here bears no resemblance to the real thing. Brolin is an amazingly talented actor, but here he is forced to play everything straight as the film's purported anchor, which ends up making Eddie more than a bit of a drag in the central role. In fact, Brolin/Eddie is so stiff here as to be painful.Worse, the only time the film comes to glorious life and gives us an idea of what a success it could have been, is when it recreates in cheeky fashion some of the set pieces from yesteryear Hollywood. Alas, these moments are too few and far between, as the film gets bogged down in the tedious and criminally unfunny kidnapping plot, which takes up too much screen time and is never as amusing or subversive as the filmmakers believe. Every time we detour to Clooney and his kidnappers, you can almost hear the sigh of frustration from the audience.An amazing cast has been compiled for the film, but a number of them are wasted. Blink and you may well miss Frances McDormand as a daffy editor or Jonah Hill as a professional patsy. Scarlett Johansson gets a nice homage to Esther Williams spectacles and shines briefly as a tough-talking actress, but is underused. Ditto, Channing Tatum, who dazzles with a Gene Kelly-esque sailor dance routine before being utterly wasted. Clooney hams it up nicely, but he is saddled with the film's worst subplot which pretty much hogties his performance. If there is a standout, it is newcomer Alden Ehrenreich as a Gene Autry-type singing cowboy. Ehrenreich seems to be one of the few acting like he is in a comedy and is perfectly believable as the nice guy rube. Some of the film's few highlights are courtesy of him being forced to step in as a last minute replacement as lead in a British comedy of manners. His miscasting is hilarious and sets off director Ralph Fiennes into spasms of apoplexy.Alas, the misses far outnumber the hits. The tiresome kidnapping plot that dominates the screen time is ultimately pointless. Between the respectable recreations of old-style Hollywood splendor set pieces, most viewers will be checking their watch. The film is episodic and haphazard - it also needs a decent editor to remove what bits simply do not work. The whole thing culminates into a disappointing viewing experience.",3,1,2,6 January 2017
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Black Swan's more pretentious self-impressed cousin
","Oscar voters and film elites adore movies that they think are about them or reflect their view of the industry, and if the legitimate stage can be woven in to give it a more literate cache, so much the better. Sometimes the results can be a true classic (see All About Eve). Other times, the result is Birdman, or as I like to call it, Black Swan's more pretentious, self-impressed cousin.Riggan Thomson is an actor of certain age, whose most recognizable feat was playing a superhero on screen, before his career stagnated. He views the lead role in a stage melodrama on the Great White Way as being his avenue back to legitimacy, but finds hurdles at every turn, including but not limited to, his ex-wife Amy Ryan, dysfunctional daughter-cum-fetch-and-carry-assistant Emma Stone, pushy agent Zach Gallifianakis, unbalanced co-star Naomi Watts, temperamental co-star Edward Norton, and some fairly ludicrous appearances by Riggan's screen alter ago, Birdman, which clues us in fairly early that Riggan is a few bricks shy of a load. He pretty much crosses the edge when make-it-or-break-it stage critic Lindsay Duncan telegraphs her intention to pan the play and trash Riggan's career.For all of the awards thrown at this film and all of the 'serious' people it panders to that think it is the equivalent of inventing the wheel, one would naturally assume that the film is particularly insightful and enthralling. One would be incorrect. The film has all of the subtlety of a bulldozer and the depth of a nearly dry puddle. Director Alejandro Inarritu (who inconceivably was awarded two consecutive best directing Oscars for this mess and the underwhelming The Revenant) seems far too self-impressed with what he places on the screen leaving the viewer with the uncomfortable impression of a completely average person masturbating to themselves in the mirror and thinking it is a legendary moment. His grandiose and bombastic fantasy sequences are both sops thrown to the average film-goer who may have somehow nodded off during the endless dialog sequences and inside jokes to artsy-fartsy film fanatics who lambaste mainstream cinema as crass.Watching the emotional and psychological disintegration of a main character is only fascinating if the film can draw us in to the character's plight from the start and works best when the character is initially fairly normal. As in Black Swan, Riggan is initially depicted as so tightly wound and hair-trigger unbalanced that he is off-putting immediately and then when he starts his descent, it has barely the same interest as passing a traffic accident.Gallons of ink have been spilled about the irony of casting former Batman Michael Keaton as Riggan, with numerous citing Batman as his downfall and this film as his resurrection. Truthfully, Keaton turned in one fairly solid performance as Batman - the same year he gave a strong performance in Clean and Sober. He appeared beyond bored when returning for the sequel, Batman Returns, and then opting out of further sequels. He followed with a gaggle of fairly forgettable character turns and outright bad lead work before fading away for a long time. His career was far more impacted by bad choices/roles than his association with Batman, a situation fairly obvious when one views the kind of Oscar-caliber actors showing up in comic books films of late and being feted for their work both there and elsewhere at the same time. Keaton's work here is shamelessly unrestrained, hammy and unbelievable. I think he is far better in his restrained and underrated turn in the subsequent Spotlight.Both Norton and Stone have some decent moments from the supporting cast, but part of the problem with this film is that there is literally no moment that seems natural. Every sequence is scripted and played like it is being put before an acting class to teach them how to hit every emotional note...and it feels like it. Never do we forget that we are watching a not especially good melodrama, featuring actors directed to pitch everything to the rafters doing BIG ACTING. Nothing in the film is especially credible, foremost the embarrassing confrontation scene between Riggan and the critic, whose near psychopathic hatred of Riggan has her planning to destroy him and the play before she has even seen it, ostensibly because this is what the writers imagine that high-falutin' critics do.The ending (or endings since there are a few too many) is particularly hard to endure and foolish. Out of his mind with stress, Riggan takes to the stage with a real gun in an effort to kill himself. Despite holding the gun to the side of his head and pulling the trigger, the film goes on to a further scene wherein he only ostensibly blew off his nose. A feat which earns him a rave review from the critic and adulation from his inner circle, while no one seems to think he intended to commit suicide. This then allows him jump out the window to his death...or fly out the window to oblivion...or whatever. I doubt much of anyone cares at that point since the film wore out its shaky welcome at least a good hour beforehand. Ideally, this film can function as a cautionary tale of what kind of terrible waste of time cinema elites pretend to love to make them feel superior, that leaves everyone else cold and scratching their heads in embarrassment for their high-minded brethren.",2,4,7,18 June 2016
Carrie," Never a huge fan of this film
","I have always had a hard time understanding the love that people have for this film. While billed as a horror thriller, even as a kid I never found it especially scary or thrilling. I think part of that comes from making the protagonist so identifiably sympathetic and the targets of her climactic wrath so ridiculously villainous that one can only walk away thinking the majority had it coming. I have never read Stephen King's original novel so I did have a fresh take when watching the film, and I had a hard time with some of it. It would still be a few years before director Brian DePalma hit his stride with Dressed to Kill, Blow Out and The Untouchables (before falling into veritable obscurity), and I find his direction really uneven and awkward here. The film seems to veer in tone from dead serious scenes to comical scenes that seem to come from a teen sex comedy of the era. DePalma is also overly impressed with utilizing cinematic trick shots, like split screens and fast-motion, which are distracting and really add nothing to the mix. The underdog theme really appeals to me, but the details of the story are unconvincing. For instance, I know that there were (and are) mean people in high school, but I don't believe that I have ever seen such en masse nastiness as what is depicted here - it is so over-the-top as to suggest a misogynistic fever dream. Carrie is relentlessly brutalized at school and at home, and only some of the time are the actions of the perpetrators believable. In light of this, Carrie's gift never seems much of a 'curse' and one just sits back waiting for her to vent her rage. Some of the issues I have are this:1. The trick played on Carrie seems to me a bit ridiculous and disgusting. I really envision very few teenagers (OK, truly none) coming up with such an idea, especially involving the murder and mutilation of animals to obtain a copious amount of blood to throw on her, when any easily obtainable liquid substance would do for their purposes. Plus the unreliable positioning of the bucket with a single rope - chances are the blood would have gone everywhere but on the target.2. Are we really expected to believe that after such a ghastly incident all of the students and teachers would then laugh hysterically over the event without making any move to help her, including the sympathetic gym teacher who has acted like a mentor to her? One poster suggested that the universal laughing was in Carrie's mind, but after several viewings of the film there is nothing to suggest that the laughing is anything but literal as depicted by DePalma. As such, their reactions are completely ridiculous.3. Finally, are we really expected to believe that Carrie in her rage would ultimately harm or kill the people who have shown her kindness along with everyone else? Not only did her date appear to be falling for her and conducted himself like a true gentleman, but it was obvious even to her that he was shocked by the trick and was almost immediately injured in its aftermath (in a really stupid way!). Are we to believe that with the type of person Carrie was that she would thoughtlessly allow the unconscious guy to burn to death in the flames? Not to mention to cruel way that she dispatches the gym teacher.The film does have another great thing going for it other than its underdog story, and this helps lift above the mundane and silly. DePalma either had a great eye for casting or a superlative casting agent. Sissy Spacek was fully worth her Oscar nomination and cuts a sympathetic and appealing figure as Carrie. Piper Laurie is a cruel delight as the quintessential religious zealot as depicted back in the days when such people were considered fringe lunatics rather than mainstream Americans (oh, the good old days!). While their characters are unbelievable, both Nancy Allen and John Travolta turn in memorably vicious efforts as the 'masterminds' behind the plot. William Katt, Amy Irving and Betty Buckley are all appealing as the various people who take Carrie under their wing and unwittingly set her up for the fall.",6,2,7,22 April 2008
Raging Bull," Ostentatiously pretentious with a one-dimensional central character
","Certainly a contender for the most overrated film ever made. I like some of Martin Scorsese's work, but I have never understood the near hysterical reactions elicited by critics and his die-hard fans over his contributions to cinema which, much like Steven Spielberg, range from wonderful to embarrassing. To them, every Scorsese film is 'brilliant.' However, despite the reassurances of various critical associations and hero-worshipping fans all too willing to declare this the greatest film made in the last 30 years, most viewers may well wonder what all of the hoopla is about. The film is a biography of boxer Jake LaMotta and documents his volatile, tempestuous nature both in the boxing ring and in his personal life. There is no doubt that Robert DeNiro hurls himself heart and soul into this role, but much of the accolades heaped onto his work center on the arduous physical labors he endured to get himself into fighting shape for LaMotta at his prime and then make himself fat to depict LaMotta having gone to seed. One must admire his dedication, but it was hardly the first time an actor had gone to such efforts  people quickly forget the weight gains of actresses such as Elizabeth Taylor for Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf or Lynn Redgrave in Georgy Girl more than a decade prior to DeNiro in Raging Bull. Ironically, other than the physical, there is nothing to recommend LaMotta as a character around whom a movie should be centered. He greets every obstacle in his life, either person or event, by trying to batter it into bloody submission. There is no range to him and he is most certainly not a charismatic person. I certainly would not wish to spend more than a few moments in his presence much less the duration of this film, which ultimately depicts LaMotta as little more than a not especially intelligent, violent pugilist. The profane dialog is anything but memorable and the people who surround LaMotta are little more than ciphers. The film is brutal and often hard to watch, more so because of its pretense rather than brutality. Scorsese films the whole thing in stark black and white and choreographs some of the boxing footage with mournful classical music. All of these touches seem to indicate a serious subject of near biblical importance  but that subject most definitely is not seen on screen in the guise of LaMotta. Joe Pesci pretty much contributes his stock Joe Pesci performance as Jake's brother. The film's biggest attempt at humor comes at the expense of Cathy Moriarty, a whiskey-voiced actress who resembles a 30-year-old vamp but who the film initially tries to pass off as a virginal 15-year-old(!). To her credit, she gets past that initial hurdle and makes Vickie LaMotta the only sympathetic character in the film. Raging Bull is by no stretch a bad film, but it is a criminally overrated one done in by ostentatious pretentiousness and an unsympathetic central character who (no matter how amazing the actor's physical transformation) is nothing more than a one-dimensional thug.",4,66,112,29 December 2006
Blade Runner," A visually stunning film that actually improves on subsequent viewings
","It's 2019 on planet Earth and blade runners are glorified bounty hunters called in to identify and destroy rogue replicants, synthetic humans with fixed life spans relegated to work in dangerous environments. Harrison Ford is a semi-retired blade runner called back into action to hunt down four renegade replicants that have mutinied and returned to earth in search of their creator, who they hope will extend their lives.Ridley Scott's science-fiction/film noir epic based on Philip K. Dick's novel may not quite live up to its legendary cult status, but it certainly comes close enough to warrant a success. I saw the film on its original release in 1982 when it received mixed critical reviews and tepid box office, but its reputation has steadfastly and deservedly grown over the years. It is that rare film that actually improves on subsequent viewings as it reveals hidden depths on further introspection and facets which were dismissed as misfires the first time around have been re-evaluated.One thing that was never disputed was the visual impact of the film. Not since Fritz Lang's legendary silent film masterpiece Metropolis has a futuristic world been depicted with such convincing and compelling realism. The Earth of Blade Runner is a grungy, polluted, rain-soaked hell-scape of seemingly endless night drenched in neon, gigantic skyscrapers and nightmarishly crowded streets. This is a rare film in that even if the story failed to work at all, one could sit in wonder for the running time just admiring the elaborate denseness of the background and the limitless imagination of the director and the set designers, costume designers, visual effects artists, and various technicians that brought it all to breathtaking life. We see flourishes of both the future and the past in everything, including wardrobes and hairstyles that remind one of the 1940s. That alone is a simply amazing achievement. Truly, the sheer verisimilitude of the environment is nothing less than stunning.The 'villains' of the piece – the replicants – are undeniably deadly, but their hopes for a better and longer life make them oddly sympathetic. These synthetic humans ironically seem more emotionally accessible than a number of the humans populating this future, which is unquestionably the point the film makes. The question of what exactly constitutes 'being human'. The lines are further blurred with the introduction of the assistant to the head of the company that manufactures replicants, a stunning beauty named Rachel (played by Sean Young), who unbeknownst to herself is a replicant with the memories of another programmed into her. Ford becomes entranced by her and feels oddly sympathetic to her plight when she begins to realize the truth.One of the things that drew many complaints initially was the low-key performance of Ford in the central role coupled with his world-weary voice-over narration. However, I have grown to believe that both elements work surprisingly well. The narration and the restraint of Ford's performance are both ingredients very popular and often important to the noir genre that Scott is partially paying homage to. Vangelis' soulful jazz-inspired score also adds to the atmosphere of the piece.Rutger Hauer is first-rate as the charismatic and threatening leader of the replicants. If his final confrontation with Ford is anti-climactic, Hauer nicely pulls off the undertones of the character's final moments on screen. Young has become a huge Hollywood joke after her career derailed a number of years ago, but her work here is quite moving and displays some of the promise that she demonstrated early in her career. Neither Edward James Olmos or M. Emmet Walsh have much to do as Ford's colleague and supervisor. Joe Turkel provides a subtle turn as the creator of the replicants. William Sanderson is also memorable as a lonely company employee whom the replicants befriend for their own reasons. And who can forget the lithe and beautiful Daryl Hannah, who makes a terrific impression as the deadly acrobatic replicant Pris. Her showdown with Ford is one of the film's highlights, even if it could have lasted longer.A truly marvelous achievement that should be watched more than once to fully appreciate what Scott and company have accomplished.",8,1,3,22 June 2011
Casino Royale," Outstanding new direction
","I freely admit that I was a naysayer on getting my initial gander at Daniel Craig as 007, but when I finally relented to see the new take on the series that essays James Bond's first mission as a 007 agent, I was more than pleasantly surprised and rank this as one of the very best in the series.Bond: The blond Craig looks all wrong for the part. With his rugged, overly craggy looks, he seems more like a rugby player or a bouncer rather than the sophisticated icon of the Bond series. However, he has the correct forceful personality to sell the role. He has Connery's hard edge and dry humor, plus there is a surprising vulnerability to his approach as an 'unpolished' Bond that makes him both more grounded and accessible than his predecessors. His off-kilter looks actually enhance the film's approach of an upstart rougher Bond. I am also hard-pressed to remember a prior Bond who could so memorably fill out a pair of tight speedos so nicely.The villain: Mads Mikkelson's Le Chiffre is rather a weak villain. Despite his intense glares and a rather nasty torture sequence, he never truly seems too much of an obstacle to Bond. Oddly, whereas most Bond films rise and fall on the strength of their villains, Casino Royale becomes a rarity in that it succeeds admirably in spite of a forgettable villain.The woman: Eva Green gets one of the best introduction lines in the series. She spends her first few moments sizing up Craig's Bond and cutting him down to size before entering into a refreshing back-and-forth banter for the remainder of the film. She is lovely and grounds her character so that not only does she seem believable, but you can nearly understand why Bond falls so passionately for her. It is one of the more intriguing female roles in the series.The screenplay, which remains largely faithful to Ian Fleming's novel, is one of its strong points. The central action centers on a high stakes poker game in the title spot in Montenegro where Bond must prevent the villain from winning the pot to finance terrorism. While it seems a somewhat mundane conceit, the film is expertly paced - balanced well between slam-bang action sequences, headier dialog-driven moments and a rather affecting romance. Judi Dench is inexplicably back as M, but she provides a nice note of consistency in an otherwise completely new direction for the series. The locations are beautiful and the leads share a particularly strong chemistry which helps sell the final third. The black-and-white opening is eye-catching and the silhouettes of naked gyrating women have been abandoned in favor of an action motif. Chris Cornell's title song seems more grunge rock than 'Bond', but is a new and distinct improvement over the last few 'wailing diva' debacles. A grand start for Craig's Bond - I look forward to more.",9,1,4,2 April 2007
Identity," Initially promising thriller whose tension sputters out at the midway point
","A textbook case of something that probably sounded daring and more entertaining on paper than it does in execution. Identity is initially an update on Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None. A legion of diverse characters become stranded in a storm at an isolated desert motel, where one by one they are picked off by someone (or something).The story is not new, but it is most definitely reliable. The atmosphere is tense, there is a definite sense of dread surrounding the proceedings. An ace cast has been compiled to inhabit the roles of the prospective victims and the screenplay throws in some twists, like all of the people discovering they were born on the same day or everyone's last name is a state. Tidbits which definitely perk the interest and make one wonder whether there is not a supernatural or metaphysical element going on. Meanwhile, a subplot is concurrently running concerning a schizophrenic murderer (Pruit Taylor Vince) and his concerned physician (Alfred Molina). Is Vince the perpetrator behind the killings? Are we seeing something that has already happened being told in flashback? Unfortunately, the screenplay has one twist that comes right around the midway mark that utterly annihilated any further suspense or rooting interest that one has in the film. The viewer is then left with a healthy expanse of dead space that becomes more tedious and illogical with each passing moment. The writers/director probably thought this novel twist was monumental, but it actually shoots the film in the foot. It is predicated on the fact that we MUST have some sympathy with the institutionalized killer - a character that is marginal at best up to that point in the film. It is completely wrong though. The viewer's sympathy and interest lie with the people back at the motel, and by robbing the main plot of any reason to become emotionally involved, the film renders itself pointless.There are good performances about. John Cusack is a solid and likable leading man. Ray Liotta trots out his familiar tough guy shtick to good advantage. Amanda Peet is a lively leading lady, although why everyone in the film is able to immediately peg her as a prostitute when she is dressed more demurely than Rebecca DeMornay's shrewish actress is beyond me. Speaking of DeMornay, it would have been nice to keep her character around a bit longer. The remainder of the cast is comprised of familiar and perfectly reliable performers like Clea Duvall, John Hawkes, John C. McGinley, etc. In fact, the two fuzziest and least involving characters are the ones portrayed by Vince and Molina - and when the film drops on us that this is where our attention should be focused and our involvement lies, it is near impossible to remain engaged any further.The latter third of the film - utterly devoid of tension despite increasing noise and hysteria - seems to go on forever. The film then, of course, attaches on a coda that leaves the door open for a possible sequel. The 'shock' revelation of the 'person' behind the murders at the hotel will not be much of a shock to attentive viewers or those at all familiar with thrillers in general. Unfortunately, the truth is that it really makes no difference who the 'killer' at the hotel is and that is what stops the film in its tracks. Definitely an A for ambitious, but a C- for the end result.",4,1,4,15 April 2011
The Sixth Sense," Solid if underwhelming work
","The Sixth Sense is a solid supernatural melodrama, whose reputation as something far better may leave new viewers underwhelmed and pondering its accolades. Known as the film that made M. Night Shyamalan a force to be reckoned with in Hollywood (a reason to be annoyed with it right there), the film is well written but follows a relatively unsurprising path up until its 'shocking' twist climax which apparently had rather dull-witted viewers who had never before seen a film inventing superlatives to describe it. The story focuses on a young boy (Haley Joel Osment) with the ability to 'see dead people' as the film's notorious tagline informs us and the relationship that develops between his stoic psychologist Bruce Willis and himself. There are a number of things to like about the film. It is atmospheric, solidly constructed and features a truly amazing central turn by young Osment, who is both believable and sympathetic as the beleaguered young boy. Toni Collette is also memorable as the boy's concerned mother. There are a few jolts here and there, but the film somehow never manages to be truly terrifying - largely because sharp-eyed viewers will intuit early on that the specters mean the boy no harm. On the downside, the film would be benefited from a better leading man. Even fans of Willis must admit that his cinema acting can be divided into two classes: smarmy or lifeless. The more serious the drama, the more lifeless Willis becomes. His chemistry with Osment is often as chilly as the temperature drop that precedes a ghost. In fact, the very tenor of his performance helps give away the much heralded surprise climax. One cannot discuss this film without touching on the climax - which is really the aspect that pushed this film over-the-top, but it is hard to explain why since many viewers will figure it out within the first 20 minutes and will not be the least blown away by the final revelation. The fact that the revelation really has no bearing on the plot itself or the personal outcome of the young boy's future is bad enough, but even worse is the fact that Willis' detached demeanor robs it of much in the way of emotional punch either. A good, but not a great film from a director known more now for his missteps than his classics.",6,0,1,9 August 2010
Sin City," Visually striking trash
","The look of this critically acclaimed film is striking: A neo-noir comic book that springs to life on the screen and is so richly textured that it takes your breath away. Unfortunately, 30 minutes later the novelty of the cinematography wears off and there is nothing to replace it. Based on a Frank Miller graphic novel that I have not read (and would not read having endured this travesty), the film is little more than a series of ultra-violent vignettes set in the dark, dank crime-riddled streets of the big city. There is nary a violent or sexual act that the film does not lovingly glorify to the point of it becoming a fetish. As depicted, every man is violent and corrupt and every woman is a whore. Despite an unending spate of recognizable faces, there is literally no likable character with which to engage viewer sympathy. None of the vignettes are surprising or clever trudging tediously from point A to B without any evidence of wit or class. There is virtually no suspense involved at any point in the film making this one of the most desensitizing and soporific films to come along in quite some time. By the time an army of barely-clad weapons-laden prostitutes take the screen amid the rivers of dark-hued blood spilled so liberally throughout the film, one recognizes that the film has devolved into little more than a sexually stunted, ADD-riddled cyber-geek's Mountain Dew-induced fever dream.",1,0,2,16 February 2007
Gangs of New York," Scorsese's 'dream' project is surprisingly insubstantial
","Purportedly director Martin Scorsese spent decades shepherding this dream project to the silver screen. When the production finally started, his ardent fans declared that the film would finally win him a long elusive Oscar and take its place as one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces of all time. Sadly, reality has a habit of intervening.Set in the latter 1800s, the film depicts the corruption, violence and conflicts between rival street gangs in the Five Points area of New York City. The film opens with a particular conflict between the Nativists, led by Daniel Day-Lewis' Bill the Butcher, and the Dead Rabbits, led in a glorified cameo by Liam Neeson's Priest Vallon. Vallon's murder by the Butcher is witnessed by his young son Amsterdam, who returns years later and unrecognizable in the guise of Leonardo DiCaprio, who is hellbent to have his revenge. This typical tale of revenge is set against the backdrop of political corruption culminating in the Draft Riots of 1863. Arguably the most surprising thing about the production is that, given its nearly 30-year gestation period, the screenplay still comes off as unfinished and aimless. The drama unfolding in the background often seems far more fascinating than what Scorsese decides to focus on, with the main revenge drama especially predictable and clichéd, populated by characters that fail to engage either our sympathy or (with only one exception) grab our attention. It is a given that DiCaprio will infiltrate Day-Lewis' gang with the old nutshell of saving him from an assassination. We know this will be followed up by Day-Lewis developing a fondness for him that DiCaprio finds himself reluctantly reciprocating, which calls his whole plan into question. We also know that DiCaprio will face constant jeopardy of exposure and that there will be one Judas in the mix. Scorsese also throws in a token love interest in the form of dirtied-up, yet still comely pickpocket Cameron Diaz, who seems to have wandered in off the set of Oliver Twist.The film ever so briefly touches on the injustice of immigrants arriving to America only to be conscripted immediately into the Union Army upon disembarking the ships – a plot thread far more interesting than anything else Scorsese spends time on. There is some attempt to depict the political corruption of the time with a glad-handing Jim Broadbent as the infamous Boss Tweed, a subplot that Scorsese handles clumsily at best. A ridiculous amount of time is spent on an election wherein DiCaprio convinces Brendan Gleeson, a man who showed him kindness on the death of his father, to campaign for office in the hopes of quelling the gang violence. The film ostensibly argues that Gleeson is a stellar pick because he is a relatively honest man from the streets, who knows the parties in question and has the courage to stand up for the people. Unfortunately, this time-consuming subplot culminates in a laughable sequence wherein after having won the election Gleeson goes to privately talk reason to Day-Lewis, who casually assassinates the man. Apparently this is supposed to be a shocking scene, but Gleeson heretofore was such a minor character and it seems inconceivable that someone as knowledgeable of the parties and their acts as the screenplay insists Gleeson is would go alone and unarmed into Day-Lewis' lair to lecture him and not see this outcome. When one reflects on how much time is lavished on this dead end subplot, it seems inconceivably wrong-headed. And if anyone can make heads or tails out of what is going on with the Draft Riots at the end, you are doing well.Additionally, the film contains a jaw-dropping instance of incongruity. At one point, Day-Lewis tortures DiCaprio and then brands his face with a large poker. This incident nearly kills the character, but yet a few scenes later, DiCaprio's face appears largely unmarred. Ahh, the joys of being a leading man.Broadbent, Gleeson, Neeson and Henry Thomas are all wasted. While both DiCaprio and Diaz are fine, neither are able to break out of their clichéd roles. We are never given any reason why Diaz's character takes an immediate shine to DiCaprio other than that he is the lead and she is the romantic interest. The only one to make a strong impression is Day-Lewis, and I don't mean that in a good way. Duded-up in 1860s fashions, swaggering about like a peacock, and twirling his hysterically villainous mustache, Day-Lewis has the tendency to remind one of an over-the-top Oilcan Harry/Snidely Whiplash clone. This performance would be perfect for The Perils of Penelope Pitstop, but not a deadly earnest Martin Scorsese drama.The final shots depicting the growth of NYC seem to suggest that we have just witnessed events of such profound impact that they influenced the very future of NYC. Yet we walk away from this film feeling none of that. Instead, it often seems that while Day-Lewis and company are holding court center stage, the most interesting develops are taking place on stage left.",5,0,1,17 June 2011
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Entertaining if overrated third film
","The third (and originally thought last) of the Indiana Jones films sets the intrepid adventurer off on a search for his missing estranged father, who specializes in Holy Grail lore. There are some wonderful things here to appreciate, but the series is starting to show some wear.Harrison Ford is first-rate as always. Sean Connery is an inspired choice to play his resourceful father. They have terrific comic chemistry and that is where the film succeeds the most. Technically it is a beautiful looking film and Spielberg and company still seem to honestly enjoy making them. However, the film falls short in other areas. While the pairing of Ford and Connery is worth the admission price alone, was it really necessary to tone back the action to such an extent. At least two action sequences (the underground escape in Venice leading into the motor boat race and the actual climax) prove to be anti-climactic. Suddenly the action ceases and it feels wrong like a plug was suddenly pulled before the pay-offs. Ditto, the final tests that Indy has to pass to get to the Grail are, if anything, lackluster. Also, the villains are exceedingly weak.The storyline resurrects the Nazis as the villains, but Julian Glover's mealy-mouthed wealthy patron is neither as threatening as the cult priest from the second film nor as memorable as the villains from the original. In fact, he is decidedly forgettable. It is nice to see John Rhys-Davies and Denholm Elliot back from the original, but why are they played suddenly with a slight comical edge that seems strangely buffoonish? And where the heck is Karen Allen? As Temple of Doom was a prequel, it was not expected to see her back in that film. However, this one follows Raiders in the timeline and there is not so much as a mention of her much less an appearance. Instead, we get blond Alison Doody, who is physically striking but plays a badly underwritten role as a sort of female Belloq (from Raiders), who is on the hunt for the Grail and will pair with anyone who will get her to it. She is not likable enough to become invested in nor hateful enough to root for her defeat, and shares zero chemistry with Ford, so she ends up merely taking up screen time. The denouement with her character will have most people shrugging rather than being especially interested. What were they thinking? By the end of the film, we have had a pleasant ride, but one that has not particularly taxed the viewer in the suspense or excitement department, which makes it seem a step backwards from Temple of Doom on that front. By contrast, the stabs at borderline campy comedy and a screenplay that is both less interesting and less intelligent than Raiders, make it pale compared to that film on those fronts. While I love Ford and Connery together and would watch this more often than not I must admit that the Last Crusade as a whole functions as a bit of an anti-climax.",7,1,6,1 May 2007
Goodfellas," Slick, flashy, often brilliant, yet cannot make you give a hoot about its characters
","Goodfellas is a technically impressive film and interesting to review largely because of the huge following it has amongst film critics and Martin Scorsese fanatics alike, most of whom reverentially believe it is his best workand they may be correct.The story based on a novel by Nicholas Pileggi chronicles the rise through the ranks of the Mafia of Irish-Sicilian Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), who has always wanted to be a gangster since he was a kid, and finds his wish granted. We follow him from a rambunctious teen to his first arrest, his marriage to Jewish wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco) through to their fall into drugs, and finally as an informer prior to entry into the Witness Protection Program.The film has a dry sense of humor and is technically and visually amazing. Scorsese loves the mobster milieu and is obviously working in his element here with a nicely picked cast. The attention to detail, the camera work, the costumes, the choice of music is all well thought out to the most intimate minutiae. The film is a fairly fascinating peek at life inside the Mafia. Scorsese allows events to unfold believably and the moments near the end where Henry and Karen become increasingly paranoid that they are under surveillance, complete with jittery, over bright intense camera work that heightens their unease, is arguably some of Scorsese's best work.The acting is fairly solid. Liotta manages to hold things together as the focal character and he gets nice support from Bracco. DeNiro manages a dignified turn as Liotta's mentor and friend. Joe Pesci won the Oscar as the psychotic killer Tommy DeVito. He is utilized well enough here to overlook the fact that it is basically the same performance he gives in everything else.Yet as amazing as the film is, it still has its drawbacks that prevent it from becoming the classic that many of its admirers would have you believe. As fascinating as Goodfellas is, I actually find Scorsese's similarly themed subsequent work Casino just as impressive technically, yet far more interesting in that it tells its tale using the backdrop of the formation of gambling mecca Las Vegas. I realize that I am in the minority with that view, but there it is.Yet most notable of all is that Goodfellas seems utterly incapable of connecting on an emotional level with the viewer. The superior Godfather films featured similar themes and focused on characters capable of shocking acts of violence, yet managed to connect on an emotional level so that we had some concern for the players. By contrast, at the end of Goodfellas, as brilliant as I thought some of the direction and technical aspects were, I found that I did not give a damn what happened to any of the characters on screen, including Henry and Karen. I was completely indifferent to whether they lived, died, escaped, etc. And this issue makes for a somewhat empty viewing experience.1990 was a very interesting film year. Coppola released his last Godfather film that year. Although it got an Oscar nod, critics largely overlooked it in favor of Goodfellas due to the fact that it is not on the same level as its predecessors. There is no question Godfather III is a flawed film, but it is also more emotionally rich than Goodfellas and any one of its flaws is more interesting to discuss at length than any of Goodfellas successes. Conversely, critics and Scorsese fans have spilled gallons of ink over the 'injustice' of Dances With Wolves winning the Best Picture over Goodfellas, but it is not hard to see why it did. DWW in its own right is just as technically impressive as Goodfellas (maybe even more so considering its director was an amateur with a passionate vision), but DWW connects emotionally with the viewer in a far more powerful way than Goodfellas ever does. At the end of DWW and Godfather III, I had to know what happened with those characters. At the end of Goodfellas, not so much. What Scorsese has achieved is certainly noteworthy and makes for a very good, solid gangster film, but most definitely not a masterpiece. It is slick, flashy and technically well done (sometimes even brilliant), but its inability to make me give a damn about any of its characters is a huge stumbling block.",7,9,18,24 April 2012
Jurassic Park," Superlative Sci-fi thrill ride
","While I am not a gigantic fan of Michael Crichton as a writer, I must admit that he does come up with tremendous concepts. Jurassic Park, while little more than a thinly disguised upgrade on Westworld, was a concept that just begged to be filmed. And let's face it, dinosaurs on the rampage are a lot more spectacular than haywire robot gunslingers. The fact that it found its perfect partner in director Steven Spielberg is just icing on the proverbial cake.Billionaire philanthropist Richard Attenborough gathers a cadre of guests to a private tropical island to view his latest enterprise, a theme park populated by genetically recreated dinosaurs. Paleontologists Sam Neill and Laura Dern are in awe, chaos theoritician Jeff Goldblum predicts doom from frame one, and grandchildren Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards are having the time of their lives. Naturally, it does not take long for something to go haywire - in this case industrial espionage that cripples the security systems of the park stranding some of the guests and allowing the dinosaurs to escape their habitats and start a rampage.There are a number of things that could have detrimentally impacted the film and Spielberg and company navigate them astutely to make the film far much more than just a summertime box office thrill ride. First are the visual effects. From the first moment that we get a good look at the dinosaurs, we never doubt their existence within the confines of the film. They appear to be genuinely living and breathing creatures that behave in perfectly convincing ways. With the minor exception of a close up shot of a brachiosaur that seems slightly underwhelming, the effects are flawless.While it is the popular stance to proclaim that Crichton's novel is better, I disagree. While there are certain scenes from Crichton's novel that I had wished made it into the film, the majority of the changes are improvements. The screenplay grabs enough of Crichton's long-winded scientific gobbledy-gook to make the concept plausible, but cuts it off before it bogs down into one of Crichton's eye-glazing rants. Additionally, Crichton's novel contained a case of such jaw-dropping, collective stupidity regarding two plot points that have wisely been abandoned for the film. One of Crichton's weaknesses is an inability to craft appealing characters and the novel of Jurassic Park is no exception. Populated by an interchangeable melange of glacial, aloof jargon-spouting ciphers and mustache-twirling villains, it is difficult to give a damn about who lives or dies in the novel, including his two appallingly charmless children characters. By contrast, the characters of the film may not be deep, but they are appealing, humorous and accessible.The acting is solid all around. Neill makes a stalwart hero, both intelligent and active. Goldblum manages a number of humorous moments as the naysayer in the group. Both Mazzello and Richards are appealing, a marked change from the novel where Richards character especially is headache-inducing. Dern does not have a lot to do, but does it well. The biggest character change from the novel is morphing Attenborough's billionaire from a cardboard villain into a warm grandfatherly figure, whose dreams of providing the world with some splendor take a tragic turn. His tete-a-tete with Dern lamenting his intentions gone awry is a touching moment.Spielberg is also at the top of his game here. Tonally the film captures the awe-inspiring wonder of E.T. with the gut-wrenching thrills of Jaws, a combination that only Spielberg can do so well. His pacing is pitch-perfect. He allows just enough time to introduce the characters, get the background of the science and the lay-out of the island, before moving full blast into excitement. The first attack by the tyrannosaurus rex is a career highlight, but the film also has a great deal of tension in a more low-key sequence when an industrial saboteur is confronted with an initially docile seeming critter that turns nasty. The concluding moments detailing the pursuit of the main characters outside of and through the main headquarters by a pack of voracious velociraptors is the stuff of white knuckles.A really amazing and worthwhile film experience that now - even after two sequels and imitators - has yet to be equaled. A rare film that functions as both popcorn entertainment, but also allows you to walk away feeling that you saw something you had never seen before. Avoid the next sequel - The Lost World - which is a dud retread directed by Spielberg on a bad day, with Goldblum's supporting character mind-numbingly bumped to the lead, and concluding with a ludicrous underwhelming rampage through...San Diego.",10,1,1,8 June 2011
