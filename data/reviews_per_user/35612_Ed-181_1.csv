The Blair Witch Project," Boring and trivial
","A good premise -- finding video and film left behind by three folks who disappeared in a dense forest -- and generally good acting -- all three main characters and those in supporting roles were fine.  However, the film is very repetitive, which makes it seem much longer than it really is.  (A plot summary would take about ten sentences, at most.)  In addition, somehow the 'villain' never seemed real.  And, PLEASE, don't tell me that someone would have prepared for such an outing (as our heroine supposedly did with her backpacker's guide) and not know that if you get lost and come upon a stream, you simply follow it downstream until you find a home, town, or the shore of a large body of water, any of which allow you to quickly find others.",2,0,1,17 October 1999
