Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I thought this movie was great!
","Like millions of people worldwide, I was very excited about the upcoming Star Wars movie. I was by no means a zealous fan of the series, having only seen the movies once or twice, but nevertheless it was quite obvious that this movie would have an incredible impact on the movie-going audience and be remembered as a great film of my (teenage, post Gen-X) generation. I first saw the The Phantom Menace the Friday after it had opened with a bunch of my friends. I sat for two hours jaw agaped at what were the most visually stunning effects I had ever seen. I left the movie thinking it was 'a cool flick' that was worth five bucks and a bit of my free time. A few weeks later I wondered if I had truly appreciated the film or even taken some serious thought as to whether or not it was just another big hype, bad script, poor acting, makin' millions blockbuster that I had for such a long time dreaded. That was when I went back to the theater. After hearing and reading so many praises and bad criticisms, I had to find out for myself. By the end of it all, I walked out of the theater very pleased with what I had just seen. As for the writing, I can see where some would find many moments a little sappy, but they were more necessary than I at first thought. The plot was interesting and was what I thought was rather well structured. The actors did a wonderful job, especially McGregor and Portman. These two young actors brought believable emotion to the film at times which it was necessary but seemingly impossible to pull off. All of this of course is, as I said earlier, topped off with some of the coolest eye candy ever. I loved it, hype and all.",Null,0,0,23 June 1999
The English Patient," Wow!
","I had never seen The English Patient before and expected little more than something that, all things considered, would be a good movie however much it might drag. The desert scenes from the trailer along with the two tapes on which the movies were on brought back memories of falling asleep during Lawrence of Arabia in film class. Nevertheless I was enthralled with the incredible acting. The cast fully utilized the wonderful script and did a terrific job all around. I was glued to the set because of this and wonderful cinematography, which I suppose I had not paid near close enough attention to while watching Lawrence of Arabia in film class. In fact, I don't think that I could truly appreciate the film or write a review that could do it justice because of my relative illiteracy as far as film viewing is concerned. The bottom line, however, is this, great film.",Null,0,1,25 June 1999
Notting Hill," A romantic comedy that's good for a change
","So many romantic comedies today are big box office draws with well known casts and do very well, unfortunately they often tend to be horribly written, unrealistic, and appeal large audiences. Notting Hill did away with this generalization of mine. Though not entirely realistic, it works its way around that by adding the realism by the characters reactions and development. The acting was well done all around and every character had depth and intrigue. And, above all else, it made for a simply great romantic comedy. This movie had the chance of being horribly done. Thank God that it wasn't.",Null,0,0,27 June 1999
