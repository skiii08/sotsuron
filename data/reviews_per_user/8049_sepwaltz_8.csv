","This movie is very famous and loved by people all over the world. This story is very moving and fantastic. A boy Elliot and E.T. who comes from planet shares a strong bond and they overcome many hardships. I respect Elliot and E.T.'s friendship. One of the most famous scenes is E.T. pointing his glowing finger to Elliot's forehead. There are many wonderful scenes and especially I like flying scene by bicycle. Elliot and his friends fly in the night sky. It is beautiful and memorable scene for me. Moreover, I also like this background music. As the story goes on, the music gets magnificent especially the climax scene so I was impressed. You can enjoy the friendship story, great visual, and music.

Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Fantastic
","It is very exciting movie. I like Disneyland and I also like an attraction of Pirates of the Caribbean but I had never seen this movie. After watching this, I regret that I didn't watch such a fantastic movie. Captain Jack Sparrow is very cool. I was surprised that the performance of Johnny Depp. I love Charlie who is a character of Charlie and Chocolate Factory and also acted by Johnny Depp. Both characters are acted by him and Charlie and Jack are quite different character, so I think it is difficult to understand that these character are acted by same actor. Captain Jack Sparrow is very unique and attractive character. These are many action scenes so full of exciting and the BGM is also wonderful. Music, actor, plot are all fantastic. I want to watch the sequel.",9,0,2,13 October 2015

The technique of CG is amazing. Some monstrous creatures are appear in this movie. Their appearances are so terrible that I shocked by them. One of the impressive scene is an egg with crack on it and light leaks from it. This scene is beautiful and exiting. Throughout the movie, it is scary to watch for me. However, I like its beautiful planet scene. Moreover, the dark tone of the color matches a sunless atmosphere of this movie.

Resident Evil," wonderful action scene
","It is a science fiction horror film and based on the video game. I have never played this game so I had only known there are many zombies and people fight them. After watching this movie, I surprised that characters are very attractive. This story is not only scary but also describe of human involvement. Alice, who is a main character of this film has no memories when she awakes. As the story goes on, gradually she regains own memories. I think these flashback scenes are great. We can realize many things at the same time she remembers her memory. It is very exciting to revere many secrets such as who is she and what she wanted to do before she lost her memories. There are many zombies and cruel scenes so this film is scary for me. However, I enjoyed action scene of Alice and her company very much.",7,1,2,13 October 2015

","This is one of my favorite film. In this film, the important item is Wonka Bar. It is very famous chocolate and all over the world, only five Wonka Bars are special. There are golden invitation tickets for Willy Wonka's chocolate factory in the each five chocolate packages. Not only in the film, but also many stores sell Wonka Bar in reality. This film is loved all over the world because of its humor character and story. Johnny Depp acted Willy Wonka, who is little strange, and eccentric character. I like his acting very much. I also like Oompa Loompa. They are very small and not human. They sing many strange songs in this film, and I can't forget their songs. They are very strange but I like them. In this film, there are many sweets and the factory looks very colorful. I can enjoy not only its story but also its visual and music.",10,3,6,14 October 2015

He gather five students to supplementary tution. He don't tell them why they must take this tution. He only says 'Write a composition about What is onself?'. He is also a mystery person and at first, his purpose is unclear. Almost all matters are hard to understand its opening, so you can enjoy watching this movie to the very end.
