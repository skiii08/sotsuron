Ali," KO'ed
","`Ali,' directed by Michael Mann and Starring Will Smith, is the story of the life of Muhammad Ali.  The movie picks up Ali's life in 1964 just before his first bout with Sonny Liston and ends after his victory in 1974 at the `Rumble in the Jungle' versus George Forman.  Throughout this time we are introduced to Ali's relationships with many of the public figures of his time.  It continues to follow him on his rise through the boxing world and his untimely defeat at the hands of the government for failure to comply with induction into the military during Vietnam.  We are also introduced to the women that came and went in his life as well.  However, it felt as though they were too worried about what to show and what not to show that they didn't show anything at all. The women just came and went and not much was done to explain.  This could be to keep Mann from getting into exposing a part of Ali that Ali doesn't want exposed, or could be done to stay with Mann's overall image of the film.  No matter the choice the film still struggles to explain many points. The film is not a complete waste though in that it does work to dig deeper into some subjects. The choice to go into Ali's relationship with the Nation of Islam and its representatives is experienced in many different ways.  You see the influence that is has on the women that he chooses, the burden it puts on him, as well as to his changes in his personality after he first is given the name of Muhammad Ali.  Another major point of the film is that of the building of his ties with Malcolm X before he is assassinated and its effect that is has on Ali.  Including the reaction to Ali's hearing of the assassination, which shows the tie the two built over time.However the one topic that is up front and center the entire film is Ali's outspokenness.  This is the only subject that comes across the entire film. You are able to see his cockiness along with the arrogant air that surrounded him constantly.  His use of rhymes gave flashy lines for the press and we even experience his bond many times with Howard Cosell.Overall the film fails to explain more of the off camera nature of Muhammad Ali.  One feels that if you were to watch old tapes of his fights or have already seen tapes of his fights you have probably seen more and learned more about Muhammad Ali than anyone leaving the theatres.  This film only seems to regurgitate that in which we already know and place it in a Hollywood setting.  Even with all the work that Will Smith puts into the character, including the additional 30 pounds, the film still is KO'ed in this mind.",Null,0,0,5 March 2002
A Beautiful Mind," Intelligence...Good or Bad?
","Intelligence, what can it do for you?  Well there are a couple possibilities.  It can either help elevate you to the next level, or it can bring you down.  Both of these solutions are brought to the forefront in Ron Howard's `A Beautiful Mind.'   The movie explores John Nash (Russell Crowe) who is very intelligent and his plight to be original.  So just what happens when a mathematician can't solve what life throws at him? `A Beautiful Mind' is a wonderful exploration of what it means to be great to some and crazy to the rest.  As the film begins you see a man who is totally engulfed in what he is doing.  He is also a man that has to have a theorem to make sense of anything that he encounters.  This, like many other mathematicians, would be his downfall.  Upon entering Princeton, he strives to find the one thing that no one else has discovered.  His only problem is where to find it.  Nash would look everywhere for that one thing to bring him to the head of the class.  Discovery would finally show its face as a blonde beauty in the local pub. John Nash makes headlines with his discovery and even gets the acknowledgement that he has so desperately desired by becoming a professor. While teaching he meets Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), a young woman who is actually a student in his class.  After going out with her a few times Nash marries Alicia and begins living a very happy life.  As he is just beginning to rise to the top, he hits rock bottom. John Nash is diagnosed as a paranoid-schizophrenic.  He is now allowing that great mind of his to control his life.  There are three characters that become prevalent at this time: Parcher (Ed Harris), Charles (Paul Bettany) and Marcee (Vivien Cardone.)  These imaginary people in Nash's life are what both push him to the edge and inevitably bring him back.Parcher is a man who supposedly works for the government and needs Nash's mind to break codes and read cryptographic messages.  Parcher is the one person, albeit in Nash's mind, that pushes John to be more than just human. He is the literal representation of Nash's ego. Charles first appears as John's roommate in college.  Charles exists to push Nash to work harder on solving his equation.  He is the one that tells him it is okay to be like he appears.  This is Nash's way of rationalizing his actions.  Finally there is Marcee. Marcee exists to show the child within him.  She shows the innocence along with the consequences of his actions if he continues to recklessly pursue his dreams.  It is through these three characters that we are able to understand John Nash. `A Beautiful Mind' is a great story of the life of John Nash.  It takes us on an emotional journey through the highs and lows of one of the greatest mathematicians.  We are able to see what pushing ourselves to the limits and beyond can do.  You can end up further behind than where you began.  A story, part about being the best that you can be, and part about knowing your limits.  It is through Nash's struggle with greatness and mental illness that we ultimately see true human nature. So what does happen to a mathematician who can't solve what life throws at him? He becomes great in his own mind.  Then somewhere along the way he becomes great in the minds of others.  Not because of what he accomplished, but how he accomplished it. It however is through this journey that he is truly able to understand what it means to be great.  I introduce to you Nobel Prize winner John Forbes Nash Jr.",Null,0,1,5 March 2002
Amélie," Amelie
","Many people when they think of foreign films probably goes right to the wrong thought, 'Oh great I get to sit and read sub-titles for 2 hours.' Well there is no doubt I thought that same thing. However, 'Amélie' changed my whole outlook on the subject. As the movie enters we are immediately introduced to the young Amélie (Flora Guiet) and all that she has gone through as a child. We get to see what has formed her life and shaped her thoughts. This works to set up Amélie's choices throughout the film.After living with her father for 5 years after her mother's death, Amélie (Audrey Tautou) moves out on her own. We get to see her try to live a normal life but it just doesn't interest her. Then all things change when she finds a box that has objects of sentimental value to someone. Amélie couldn't just leave it be. She had to go and figure out who's it was and return it to them. Upon asking the neighbors she learns that it is a man by the name of Bretodeau. She searches for him and finally gives him back his box. This would set up the rest of the movie. Amélie becomes a person that looks out for others. She helps out Lucien (Jamel Debbouze) when Collignon (Urbain Cancelier) is always yelling at him. She helps out a blind man when he isn't able to cross the street. All of these people need something, including Amélie. The only difference is that there is no one to help her. It however is through her plight to bring others together that she ultimately helps herself. Some of the choices in the writing were magnificent. I couldn't get over the thought that Guillaume Laurant and Jean-Pierre Jeunet must have put into this screenplay. The idea of creating all the games for her to play to solve her problems was brilliant. Not to mention the casting by Pierre-Jacques Bénichou and Valerie Espange worked wonderfully. They chose actors that fit the roles and gave a very down to earth feeling to the film. These actors placed in the vibrant colors of Marie-Laure Valla's set decorations created some very memorable images. One that comes to mind is Amélie sitting in bed with the beautiful red walls behind her. There were various locales that used color in a very effective manner. The show is all about this 'dream-like happiness' that Amélie so desperately desires. I felt that it was very important to give it that dreamy feeling and they did just that. I would greatly recommend that you go and see this film if you haven't already. I know to some the thought of reading sub-titles doesn't exactly tickle their fancy. However, give Amélie a chance and she just might change your mind, and your life.",Null,1,5,15 January 2007
