The Blair Witch Project," 100% Pure FEAR! It's the scariest film I've ever seen!
","'The Blair Witch Project' is the first film I've seen that has truly scared me. I first saw the film at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival and was amazed. Even an hour after the film, my adrenaline was pumping.
The best part about this film, is that it's the unknown, the unexplained, and the unseen which creates such fear. These days, too many films try to scare an audience by using graphic content. Real fear however, I think comes from what we can't see. And this is what makes 'The Blair Witch Project,' such an incredible film.Phenomenal acting and an amateur home video approach, draws the viewer into the film so well, that fear can truly be experienced. 'The Blair Witch Project' is an awesome film that is definitely worth seeing.",10,2,5,6 February 1999
