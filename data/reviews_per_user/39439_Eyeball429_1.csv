Requiem for a Dream," Favorite type of movies - psychological thrillers
","I just have to say, after watching 'Requiem For A Dream' over ten times in three weeks, that this is the most powerful, yet disturbing movie I've ever seen. I believe it should be a required viewing for High School students - maybe to give them a different outlook on life. If I had seen this movie in High School, I believe I wouldn't have done the things that I have done. I wish there was a way to let Selby and Aronofsky know how deeply I feel about this story. I have shown many friends this movie and their response is usually... 'This movie is f*cking awesome, but I can never watch it again!' That's exactly how I feel about it, but it's too compelling to leave it alone! Thank you, Darren, for making a new classic - In my top five after the first viewing! Ellen Burstyn was truly amazing and should've won an Oscar for Best Actress. The supporting cast was superb, as well. I never thought I would see Marlon, Jared, Jennifer...and ever Chris McDonald and Keith David in such a small but important and cruel role! What a great movie! From 1 to 5 stars - I give it a 10!",10,0,1,5 April 2002
