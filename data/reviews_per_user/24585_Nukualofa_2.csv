Requiem for a Dream," It'll turn you upsidedown
","Seeing this movie was like falling 100 feet straight down. Believe me, I've done it, and when I left the cinema I felt about the same way as I did when I fell. I sweated, my knees were shaky, my face was paler than usual, and I generally felt quite ill. The movie's a punch to the spleen, and it should be enough to keep people, who are curious on drugs, away from them. This is the movie in A Clockwork Orange. You won't feel like eating snacks, so just save that money. It's raw, it'll change the way you look at things, and it's a masterpiece. My moviecollection will never be complete without it. Own it, please. It's worth all your money.",10,0,0,13 August 2001
There's Something About Mary," There's something about Cameron Diaz
","This is a really great movie. I recommend it to everybody who has a thing for slapstick humor. It's a really lighthearted film, with a great cast (it has to be Chris Elliott's finest hour, as Woogie). And what's there to say about Cameron Diaz, that hasn't already been said. She's amazingly talented, unbelievably beautiful and her laughter alone makes it worth adding this movie to your collection.",7,0,0,16 April 2001
