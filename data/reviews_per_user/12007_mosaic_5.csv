Antz," Staightforward and honest.
",This film is good and entertaining. I think it lacks the magic of most animated films.,Null,0,0,29 October 1998
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The truth!
","This is my favorite movie of all time. It is a perfect '10.' It is the movie I use to measure all movies. The plot is perfect, the acting is perfect, the humor is perfect, the cinamatography is perfect. How 'Chariots of Fire' beat it out for best picture is well beyond me.",Null,0,0,29 October 1998
The Mummy," It will make you jump!
","Great show--entertaining! Good action, special effects, good humor, and good story. The negative is, the movie spoon fed all the story to you. There was nothing to figure out on your own. But aside from that, it was very entertaining. Go see it!",8,0,0,10 May 1999
Titanic," Excited!
",I thought Braveheart was the best movies of the 90s! Then Titanic comes along with an old story told in such a unique and great way! There was chemistry and magic on the screen from the time the two lovers met! I don't think it won enough Academy Awards!,Null,1,1,29 October 1998
The Matrix," Someone's strange dream.
","The Matrix started with a good idea for a subject about reality. Then added a babe, a shoot-em up, and some Kung Fu and called it a movie. If you can dodge a bullet, why do you need Kung Fu. His mission is to save the world? Most the planet is burned beyond recognition, if he brings people back to reality, where are they going to live. Not a tight story! This is an easy one to miss!",3,3,8,10 May 1999
