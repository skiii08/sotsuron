Requiem for a Dream," Dream Indeed, But Nightmarish Reality
","If any one film this year gives you the cold, hard facts about addiction, substance-abuse and perversion it's Aranofsky's sophomore entry to his career - REQIUEM FOR A DREAM.A brilliantly hand picked cast still can't save the script (which *is* well designed) from its own self-destruction and eventual redundancy.The moral of the film I received was 'family dependence & love (the only true virtue) must remain intact,' but the average non-associated Aronofsky viewer will probably find this difficult within the first 45 minutes.Far from the genius plot construction of 'Pi', DREAM'S own imaginative and quick camera-use still makes this a notable entry on the subject.Even though it's hard to stomach amputations and geriatric perversions, and moves in a psychotic camera speed the film is well made.  It's a marvel of the subject, a rather brilliant standout of the crowd - but I doubt I will find myself watching it again.Until next timeÂ… On the ball, off the rocker, and very-very low key.",6,0,1,19 December 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Wonderful Trip Through a Muddled Land
","This film is a wonderful sleigh ride through a complex world previous history enough for three or four small universes.  It is a very entertaining movie, with effects that a year ago would not just be wonderful, but impossible.  It is violent - a small war without smart bombs that kills a million non-entity creatures for grins.A fanatic IMDB following voted this film as one of the top 250 ever made within 24 hours of its release.  Kids, isn't it class time or something? One hopes enough sane members gang up to rescue film history from this terrorist hijacking. A gentlemen's 7 is quite satisfactory, thanks.Get ready for the feast but be warned: In three hours of screen time this film can't find a way to end; the small Hobbit heros are made with camera angles and dwarf stand-ins that don't fool you for one second; and there is enough Deus Ex Machina magic to make an Antarctica of Frosties get up and dance around.See the movie, it is fine, but please don't worship it!",7,0,0,24 December 2001
Black Hawk Down," Small Quick Wars are as Dangerous as Small Quick Bullets
","The wonder of Scott's storytelling is overpowering.  We see the Somali mission quickly bog down in the politics and befuddlement of a civil war, played in the photographic beauty, golden light and mid-eastern music that frames this marvelous film.  This is one of the few films I can recall that is better than the book, more clearly illustrating the confusion, dirt and bloody fright that the young soldiers experienced.Many films have been made about modern war, but few have had the solid ring of truth that Black Hawk Down emits.  In 'Saving Private Ryan', Spielberg brilliantly played the awful chaos of combat against the fact that there was a truly noble cause, a clear goal, and a path to true victory.  For the US Army troops in Somalia, there was no solace in such hope for great outcomes, only the need to survive and bring your buddies with you.  Scott shows us what all combat veterans know - gallantry in combat is fueled by camaraderie, even when the initial nobility of just cause becomes a fetid wish to simply escape unharmed.`Black Hawk Down' is raw, violent and brutal.  Through this art, we armchair strategists are forced to pay some fraction of the price that we so easily ask our youth to cough up.  This movie is a thrilling, fearsome lesson for us, as entertaining as that sudden few seconds when your out of control car takes you backwards across the highway and onto the grass, and as likely to make you sit quietly afterward and thank your stars that you escaped unharmed.",10,0,0,23 January 2002
