Hereditary," Don't believe the hype
","I was so looking forward to a great scary film. Billed as the new Exorcist. I'm afraid this fell well short of that. Where Exorcist was ground breaking in so many ways and genuinely scary, Hereditory was slow and disjointed.The characters didn't really gel, the plot seemed to move from key moments with no further explanation, and remove main characters in the blink of eye and with no real context to it. The death of Charlie is one example, there isn't any aftermath considering how it happened? The Dad burning up, just what? and finally the mum cutting her own head off, then her body in the worship position, none of it made any sense.Its not the worst horror film I've ever seen, but for one that's supposed to play on your mind, this will only play on you mind because you wasted good money on it.",3,3,6,2 July 2018
