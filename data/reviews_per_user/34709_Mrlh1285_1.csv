The Ring," Before you die...you see the Ring...and you die of UTTER BOREDOM
","After leaving 'The Ring,' I couldn't help but feel completely disappointed. This film looked incredibly promising in its television commercials, but really amounted to nothing by the end.This movie attempts to be an artsy, elegant, and stylish thriller, but really turns out to be all smoke and mirrors.  The events are outrageously unrealistic and I guarantee that you will leave with a lot of questions unanswered.Two aspects of this film were impressive, however.  Naomi Watts sizzles and gives a performance as equally impressive as her previous effort in 'Mulholland Drive.'  The cinematography is also fairly impressive.
In 'The Ring,' the plot seems to move almost mechanically and doesn't have any conflict.  There is really no climax, but instead, a number of overly-built up cheap thrills.  If you see 'The Ring,' you probably will die, of either boredom, or most likely disappointment.",5,0,0,19 October 2002
