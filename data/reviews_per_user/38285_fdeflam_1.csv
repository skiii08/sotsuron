First Man," Dark and gloomy and not what I hoped it would be
","Just my opinion. I was really looking forward to this movie, but it fell way short, in many ways. It seemed mostly accurate, in terms of the history and representation, but the script, cinematography (!) and acting/character presentation really turned me off. It did not draw me in at all, even though I really wanted to like this, since it's such an amazing story. I was hoping for an Apollo 13-like experience and it's nothing close to that. The camera work was also very strange and so consistently in-your-face. Hopefully someone else will take a stab at this in future and do a better job with it.",3,1,3,24 December 2018
