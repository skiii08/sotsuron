Deja Vu," Pay Attention!
","Action-packed movie with a good overall plot. Denzel Washington play a local ATF agent who gets deeply involved into the case he is working. Some of the sci-fi may have been a little 'out-there' and not well-explained, but it was worked well into the story. Pay close attention to subtle things happening in the movie. Even if they don't appear to have anything to do with what is happening, they may mean a lot later on.Given the opportunity, I might watch it again just to see what I missed. While it is a must-see on DVD, it certainly is worth seeing on the big screen with theatre-quality sound for the special effect sequences.",8,1,2,4 December 2006
