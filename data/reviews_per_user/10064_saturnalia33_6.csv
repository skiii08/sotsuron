Lucky Number Slevin," Vapid Trash Slick Flick
","Lucky Number Slevin is one of those films that looks slick as snails but has a worse setup than a stunt in Jackass. In an effort to look and and feel cool, it negates that one thing that makes a cool film, which is a great plot line with some snazzy unforeseen twist(s) and witty dialogue. However, within the first twenty minutes, the plot and twist was obvious to anyone with half a brain, leaving the slickness of the film to pick up the slack but without one notable line of speech by any of the great range of actors, by the time the 'revelation' is revealed at the end of the film, you just want let out a sigh and wonder why Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsly, Bruce Willis and Lucy Liu have put their names to such trash.",4,6,15,14 June 2006
Brokeback Mountain," An Oscar worthy movie full of twists, turns and outstanding performances.
","The story begins in 1963 where two saddle riders are looking for work in a dead end town and are put to work guarding sheep on Brokeback Mountain. Over the course of several weeks, they develop a friendship which on a cold and drunken night becomes something more. At first they are wary of what they have done but realise that what they have shared which each other overrides any shame or anguish they may have about their taboo relationship. It soon develops into more than either two could have imagined but of course there are difficulties to overcome. Heath Ledger's character, Ennis Del Mar, is to be married in November and cannot commit to Jake Gyllenhaal's character, Jack Twist, who wants them not to hide what they have and move somewhere where they can make a living and continue their relationship unabated. However, Ennis cannot make this commitment and rejoins his fiancÃ© and marries.The story picks up years later when Ennis has 2 children of his own and receives a postcard from Jack that he will be in town. When Jack turns up on the doorstep, none of the affection has diminished and they passionately embrace, a move which is not missed by Ennis's wife and the seeds of disaster are sown. Over the next lot of years they make trips away to 'fish', and life continues as normal as far as Ennis's character can foresee. Due to their on/off relationship and intricate nature of their own desire for each other, Jacks character also marries after knocking up a girl he woo's at the rodeo and both women are obviously kept in the dark to their extra-marital affair.The film explores the deep seated bigoted machismo of the American mid-west and the necessity to hide their love even when they are not around their wives. However, it is more of a film where a secret love must be hidden from everyone even to the point of hiding their true feelings from each other. About how such a love can have disastrous impact on those around them when such a love is revealed and how love survives through even the most difficult times. If you thought Brokeback Mountain was just a gay cowboy movie then you are in for a revelation. If you thought Brokeback Mountain was just a love story then you're in for a surprise. The film is as groundbreaking as it is a treat to watch. Do yourself a favour and saddle up to an Oscar worthy movie full of twists, turns and outstanding performances.",8,7,9,11 January 2006
Silent Hill," fantastic dark visual sequences
","In the past, Hollywood has thrown some pretty poor video game based films at their audience such as Doom, Mortal Kombat and Tomb Raider, so it was with trepidation that I went to see the adaptation of the successful computer game series Silent Hill.I had never played the game and had it pinned as a family member of Resident Evil and expected a movie based on a town over-run with zombies and lots of shot-gun action. Instead I was pleasantly surprised with uber-nightmarish visuals and no cheap shock-tactic camera tricks. The demons are most certainly real in the town of Silent Hill and creepy as hell to boot.It all begins when a little girl, Sharon, goes sleep walking in the middle of the night and her parents find her on a precipice near the family house looking into a firey cataclysm. that only she can see. It turns out that this is not uncommon and she often goes off in the middle of the night in search of a place called Silent Hill. Rose, her mother, disagrees with her husband, played by Sean Bean, that the daughter needs psychological help and decides to take her to the deserted town of Silent Hill to find some answers.However, a lone cop spots Rose and Sharon asking for directions to Silent Hill at a petrol station and follows them towards the deserted town. After pulling them over and with Rose hitting the gas to escape to her destination, a pursuit ends in disaster with an awakening on the edge of the dreamlike ash-raining town. Worse still, Sharon is missing and Rose enters Silent Hill to find her.Things quickly descend into a living darkness and after failing to find her daughter in a plot sequence familiar to Don't Look Now, Rose hooks up with the cop, Cybil, to find her daughter. If they can get out alive and find out just what is going on.Silent Hill's first half fires along at a great pace, with monsters, demons and fantastic dark visual sequences which are among the best I have seen in any horror film. However, what lets the movie down is when it tries to explain itself and the last half an hour, although still pretty cool, implodes on itself with mediocre dialogue and a flimsy plot structure in an attempt to tie up loose ends and explain to the audience just what the hell is going on when I feel viewers should be left in the dark just like the characters were for most of the film. Nevertheless, it is the best video game cum movie I have seen so far and would make a good DVD to add to any burgeoning horror collection.",7,1,2,26 April 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," A gem of a movie
","Pan's Labyrinth seems like quite a left-field film for director Guillermo del Toro, who is responsible for such recent Hollywood popcorn as Hellboy and Blade II. However, it's not the first time he has used the Spanish Civil War as a backdrop for this style of film. His 2001 movie The Devil's Backbone was another drama/fantasy/horror set in 1939 Spain when General Franco's right-wing Nationalists are poised to defeat the left-wing Republican forces.Pan's Labyrinth takes place in 1944 after Franco's victory and a young girl is travelling with her mother and adoptive father, who is the captain of the guard, to a rural area in northern Spain in order to wipe out the lingering Republican forces.The young girl is Ofelia and is being brought unwillingly with her pregnant mother by order of her adoptive father, the tyrannical Captain Vidal whom she refuses to recognise as her adoptive guardian. She has brought with her a bundle of books which are all fairy tales and it seems this is a world that she often travels to in order to escape the harsh environment in which she has found herself growing up in.While Captain Vidal sets about eliminating the bandits that live out in the woodlands surrounding the base, Ofelia is contacted by a fairy who brings her to a nearby labyrinth where she is told by a faun named Pan that she is the lost princess who's soul has finally reappeared in Ofelia's body and that she must succeed in 3 tasks to prove her true worth and be reunited with her father, the King, who has been waiting for her return.The film makes fantastic use of two main plot lines. One of which concerns Ofelia and her three tasks and that of Captain Vidal and the bandits, each of which overlap with other subplots and are beautifully woven together to make a fantastic storyline both contextually and visually. The acting is sound from everyone concerned and the CGI creatures that exist are realistically portrayed and fit in perfectly with the story being told, adding extra depth and edge to the mystical world in which Ofelia finds herself.Pan's Labryinth is a gem of a movie and one the best movies of 2006. Go and see it.",9,2,5,11 December 2006
Little Miss Sunshine," Charming, laugh-out-loud family road movie for adults
","I wasn't sure what to expect from Little Miss Sunshine. From the trailers it seemed like an indie-orientated family road-trip movie and I suppose to a certain extent it is. You have what could be construed as cliché family members: self-righteous dad who tries his best to force his opinions and beliefs on everybody else even though he's a loser; an angst-ridden teen; gay uncle working out his own issues and a grandfather who has reached a certain age he doesn't care who he offends. However, it is how these characters work together and the situations they find themselves in that elevates this film to hilarious heights instead of hitting comedy rock bottom.The film begins as a young girl, Olive, is reviewing a Miss America pageant and mimicking her winning emotional behaviour. Meanwhile the father, Richard, is presenting his 9-step plan to a group of school children and the mother, Sheryl, is picking her brother Frank up from hospital after a failed suicide attempt. As they congregate at the family house for dinner, we are introduced to Olives older teenage brother Dwayne who is on a self-imposed silence and hates everyone and their grandfather Edwin who is snorting heroin before dinner.During the less-than-successful family dinner where arguing and bickering ensues, a phone call is made whereby Olive finds out that due to a drop-out she is now in contention for the Little Miss Sunshine title. Leaving no-one behind, the family jump into their VW wagon and set off across the country to the pageant where comedy drama ensues.The key to the laughs in this film are mainly down to two things: the actors delivery of the material and the material itself. Some of the best lines are delivered by Alan Arkin who plays the free-talking grandfather who has been secretly training Olive for her routine for pageants. He speaks his mind about whatever he feels like including his own life-experience advice. Naturally, this being a road-movie, everyone learns something and they are richer for the experience. The bonus is that the audience is richer for the laughs they are given. Despite the apparent un-original set-up, Little Miss Sunshine is far greater than the sum of its parts and is a charming, laugh-out-loud family road movie for adults.",8,7,12,11 December 2006
V for Vendetta," Highly watchable but lacking in firm ground
","V for Vendetta is another comic book adaptation from Alan Moore whose previous works - The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and Hellboy - were brought to the silver screen and, I have to say, sucked pretty hard. However, there was more hope for this movie because the screenplay was written by the Wachowski brothers and the director James McTeigue was the first assistant director on all three Matrix flicks indicating that there would be a happier working structure between what's on the page and what appears on celluloid. Nevertheless, controversy surrounded the movie due to the use of scenes of the bombings on the London Underground train network and Alan Moore publicly disassociating himself from the movie and cutting his remaining ties with DC Comics.The film is set in a futuristic England that has become a fascist state akin to something straight from 1984 where the government controls all form of life and the public are told what the government want the people to believe. However, a lone figure makes an entrance onto the stage to refute the current state of being, opposing the government and fighting for the freedom from autocracy. Caught up in his plot to overthrow the current state, Evey, played by Natalie Portman, is seduced by V, played by a masked Hugo Weaving and becomes a target herself.Over the course of the film, Evey discovers herself in an implausible manner that I cannot divulge lest giving plot detail away, and becomes V's unofficial aide and ultimately plays a vital role in his crusade.Whilst I found the movie to be highly watchable, it was also lacking in firm ground, and was as fictitiously futuristic as it was unbelievably unconvincing in terms of suspension of disbelief. The acting all round was over the top but entertaining and despite its lacking, it is a decent action thriller worthy of renting for a Friday or Saturday evening.",7,1,2,20 June 2006
