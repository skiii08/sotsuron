Blade Runner 2049," Visually stunning masterpiece that just might be the best movie of 2017
","Don't worry, this is a spoiler free review.We've had a plethora of excellent films this year; Dunkirk was gripping, War for the Planet of the Apes was stunning, Logan was awesome, Baby Driver was wonderful, Wonder Woman was great, Spider-Man was super and Guardians 2 was as fun as Marvel movies get.Blade Runner 2049, however, was nothing like them. The original has become a cult classic and for good reason, it's intriguing and original. 2049 is not unlike its predecessor. That's not to say that it is a copy of the 1982 movie though. Many sequels simply rehash the first one (Star Wars, Guardians of the Galaxy 2, etc), which isn't necessarily bad, just nothing new. Blade Runner 2049 ties-in to the original while giving us a new story.The score is transcending and the visuals are astonishing. Watch it at the theatre, you won't regret it.However, it is a slow movie. Well over 2 hours long, it's paced as was the original. So, if you're one for action, minimal talking and don't care too much for deeper meanings this might not be your kind of Sci-Fi film.The acting is superb and Gosling does a great job at portraying his character. I don't want to say too much in fear of spoiling anything, but through facial expressions you know exactly what he's feeling, even if it's not exactly relatable. Harrison Ford is awesome as usual and all other supporting actors do a fine job as well.The movie had quite a few twists and I left feeling quite drained. It was inspiring.Just like the original, this one leaves you with a lot of questions and the androids are always a mystery. Do they have a soul? Are they really just machines? And do they dream of electric sheep? In a world where technology is becoming more and more advanced every day, and AI has already arrived, it makes you wonder about how close to reality it all is. The scary thing is that it could all be possible one day, in 30 years? Or in 100? No one really knows, but it won't fail to instil just a little technophobia in you.Watch it!",10,4,17,7 October 2017
