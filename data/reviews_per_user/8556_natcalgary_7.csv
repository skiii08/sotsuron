Ford v Ferrari," 2.5 hours flew by as if it were going 7000+ RPM
","This has become my favorite car movie as there are no distracting sub-plots about love or whatever.
This is a straight forward car movie based on real events and the 2 and a half hours went by as if the movie was going 7000 RPMAmazing acting throughout8.2",8,2,2,6 January 2020

Knives Out," slow burns until it doesnt
","This was difficult to stat focused at the beginning. at times so slow. then it picked up and picked up and it was a race to the finish.this was not a 9 or 10 like many commenters will have you believe. but the great cast and finish did it justice.
a solid 8.2",8,1,3,21 March 2020
Aquaman," bad one liners and cgi
",I wanted to like this. i mean aqua man is always the butt end of jokes because he really doesn't have much for powers. but after watching this it proves once again that marvel is just a step ahead in every way over dc.6.2,6,1,3,28 January 2019
Bird Box," About the same as 'a quiet place'
","Both movies were very similar. The acting was better in this one only because they actually got to talk. Similar to a quiet place it leaves unanswered questions. This is why i can't rate it high, but still a good watch with much suspence.6.4",6,1,5,19 December 2018
Yesterday," Great Film
","Didn't know anything about this movie when I turned it on.
The acting story line and of course the music was exceptional.happy feel good movie for everyone7.8",7,1,2,11 September 2019
