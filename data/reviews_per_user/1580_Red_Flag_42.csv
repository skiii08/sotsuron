Changeling," Eastwood goes through the motions but Angie Works up a storm.
","By this point we all know what to expect when you walk into a Clint Eastwood movie. It's going to be upsetting, it's going to be authentic and its going to be a beautiful movie, these no doubting that. At this point though, it all seems like Oscar Bait, abit like The English Patient. Where Changeling differs is the films ability to tell a intriguing story without seeming pretentious. Its handle with graft and care if not a whole load of originality.What will attract moist to the movie is Angelina Jolie's performance, almost unrecognizable as a struggling mother; it's hard to comprehend the fact that this was the same woman who only a few months ago played a tomboyish assassin in 'Wanted'. This movie is crafted so well, every character in this movie done with the utmost attention from the writers and while most might complaining about the excessive running length, for me this film needed to be that long. It's that complex and there are that many story arcs that it's a necessary formula.Inspired by actual events that occurred in 1920s-era Los Angeles, Clint Eastwood's The Changeling tells the story of a woman driven to confront a corrupted LAPD after her abducted son is retrieved and she begins to suspect that the boy returned to her is not the same boy she gave birth to.The year was 1928, and the setting a working-class suburb of Los Angeles. As Christine (Angelina Jolie) said goodbye to her son, Walter, and departed for work, she never anticipated that this was the day her life would be forever changed. Upon returning home, Christine was distressed to discover that Walter was nowhere to be found.Over the course of the following months, the desperate mother would launch a search that would ultimately prove fruitless. Yet just when it seemed that all hope was lost, a nine-year-old boy claiming to be Christine's son seemed to appear out of thin air. Overcome with emotions and uncertain how to face the authorities or the press, Christine invites the child to stay in her home despite knowing without a doubt that he is not her son. This story's resolution, while decent felt a little disjointed to me. While it would have done fine ending at one key moment, Eastwood Carries the film along for too long making it feel as if it has as many endings as Return of the King. This is not a best director picture film for me. I love what Eastwood does but its all very familiar grounds, its the other elements, the superb acting, the astounding source material, the well scripted story and the orchestral score. These elects fit together so seamlessly that it would almost be a tragedy if this want in the running for best picture. While with Angelina Jolie, I think its a sure-fire answer over what's she's taking home come award season.Verdict: A competent, cleverly crafted period piece that combines all of its elements so seamlessly it dabbles on perfection. The lack of flair and originality shown by Eastwood is a bit of a letdown but Changeling rivals his best movies.",8,5,9,3 December 2008
Frost_Nixon," Its the Rocky of political dramas
","If anyone were to do justice to a role that deserves justice done to it its Frank Langella as Richard Nixon. There isn't a second in the gorgeously crafted film that he loses focus and while he doesn't look like the man himself to a degree he certainly embodies the character, as does the supporting cast. Michael Sheen flawless and the self obsessed talk show host attempting to exonerate Nixon. The real triumph however comes in the form of the direction. Ron Howard has undoubtedly brought his a game to this. There isn't a moment of boredom simply because of the fact that its films as such a quick pace it feels impossible to reach that level of boredom.The reason this film works so effortlessly as it does is due to the fact that, unlike many other historical dramas, it doesn't feel like a history lesson. Anyone with a pet peeve for this sort of historical account will still find enjoyment in Frost/Nixon because it's just so goddamn entertaining, with a pacing to rival any Rocky movie.The director Ron Howard shoots his movie with such an energy and such resemblance to, as I said before, a boxing match that it's no wonder this is one of the front runners at this years Oscars. It may climax like a Rocky film, but doesn't end like one. There are more words to be said, and you're glad for every one.Hollywood heavyweight Ron Howard adapts playwright Peter Morgan's West End hit for the silver screen with this feature focusing on the 1977 television interviews between journalist David Frost (Michael Sheen) and former president Richard Nixon (Frank Langella). At the time Nixon sat down with Frost to discuss the sordid details that ultimately derailed his presidency, it had been three years since the former commander in chief had been forced out of office. The Watergate scandal was still fresh in everyone's minds, and Nixon had remained notoriously tight-lipped until he agreed to sit down with Frost. Nixon was certain that he could hold his own opposite the up-and-coming British broadcaster, and even Frost's own people weren't quite sure their boss was ready for such a high-profile interview.When the interview ultimately got under way and each man eschewed the typical posturing in favor of the simple truth, fans and critics on both sides were stunned by what they witnessed. Instead of Nixon stonewalling the interviewer as expected, or Frost lobbing softballs as the truth-seekers feared, what emerged was an unguardedly honest exchange between a man who had lost everything and another with everything to gain. In this film, viewers are treated to not only a recreation of that landmark interview, but a behind-the-scenes look at the power struggles that led up to it as well. Tim Bevan, Eric Fellner, and Brian Grazer team to produce a film adapted for the screen by original play author Morgan (The Queen and The Last King of Scotland).It sounds like an awful night out in the cinema. But you will be amazed. In Frost/Nixon Ron Howard turns this duel between Michael Sheen's glossy playboy and Frank Langella's shifty ex-President into a gripping tango of egos. The two-hour plus running time zooms by as the so-called 'thinking man's Rocky' plays like an intellectual boxing match with Nixon effortlessly dodging Frost's hesitant jabs and the young challenger looking like he won't last the distance.Verdict: Thought Ron Howard was going to stuff it up? Think again - Frost/Nixon's a great advert for stage-to-screen adaptations. And if you'd forgotten the power of the close-up, prepare to be dazzled by dapper Dave and Tricky Dick. For my overall rating I give 'Frost/Nixon' 4/5.",9,1,2,20 February 2009
The Incredible Hulk," You Will Like Him When He's Angry
","Second time lucky for this marvel character. The first outing much hated but slightly underrated was if I'm being honest a little disappointing. Then it's no surprise that this surpasses it in almost every respect. 'You wouldn't like me when I'mÂ… hungry!' Bruce Banner mumbles in mangled Portuguese at the start of this all-or-nothing stab at reanimating the DOA Hulk franchise.Delivered to a bunch of gringo-hating factory workers at the Rio bottling plant where the fugitive scientist is working undercover, it's the first indication of the bold new direction French director Louis Leterrier (The Transporters 1 & 2, Unleashed) wants to take with what is, for all Universal's protestations to the contrary, Hulk Part Deux. Out go Ang Lee's comic book panel-replicating visuals, his ponderous art-house sensibilities and those long, lingering close-ups on his stars' anguished features. Instead, his successor does something very different Â– he brings the funny. Whether seeking out elasticised trousers in a Mexican market or trying to keep his cool in a speeding New York taxi cab, it's a tactic Edward Norton seems more than happy to run with. As both leading man and pseudonymous co-writer (a sign of a mooted dispute with Leterrier and producers Marvel over the final cut), the Fight Club actor has more riding on this than anyone else and responds with what may be his most appealingly quicksilver performance to date.It's hard to imagine anybody making a runaway boffin poisoned by gamma radiation trying desperately to contain the raging id within even halfway credible. But Norton somehow does, implicating us in his protagonist's Jekyll-and-Hyde dilemma while gently tipping the wink to its essential ludicrousness. (If you're unconvinced, check out the scene where he apologetically desists from coitus with Liv Tyler's Betty Ross lest it escalate his heart rate and bring on a transformation.) All of which creates an unusual problem: The Incredible Hulk is at its most entertaining when the Hulk himself is off-screen. Bring him on and the picture becomes spectacularly average: a bland CGI extravaganza which pits Banner's green alter-ego (leaner and more sinewy than the original's bulbous Gumby) against hi-tech military hardware, exploding fireballs and a fellow pixellated mutant to increasingly numbing effect. The last of these, the much-vaunted Abomination, is the movie's deadliest WMD, facilitating as it does an extended smackdown on the streets of Harlem that gives the film its set-piece climax. As with the Hulk, though, he's much more compelling in human form, Tim Roth evincing a snarling ferocity and feral machismo as the carnage-craving commando who lives for the fight. It's telling that the single most exciting sequence Â– a breathless foot pursuit through Rio's cramped, vertiginous favelas Â– has not one fantastical bogeyman in sight.After all, who needs computers when you have two of the greatest actors of their generation going hell for leather in one of the most geographically improbable locations on the planet?Better than Hulk? That's a given, especially with Norton and Roth leading the cast. When they give way to their CG replacements, though, Leterrier's film loses the very elements that lift it out of the ordinary.",6,1,4,15 June 2008
Kung Fu Panda," Jack Black's back, only this time its digital.
","Were sure it's not easy being an animated flick in a world where everybody can't wait for WALL-E but even with this looming Kung Fu Panda was not scared away. A valiant attempt to outdo Pixar is slightly smouldered by its misuse of its supporting cast (Angelina Jolie, Luci Lu and Jackie Chan) However with the failure that was Shrek the Third this is a film that puts DreamWorks credibility back on the line, will it ever be as good as Pixar? Probably not but Kung Fu Panda proves it can (at very least) look better than Pixar.Visually, Kung Fu Panda is pretty unstoppable. High flying kicks and punches that can't be replicated in real life making this a must see for martial arts fans but the low brow humour and the fact that while the film manages to pull off some stunning visual treats but never really going anyway with the plotting makes this a fun but ultimately forgettable movie event. Brilliantly beautiful if a little flat. Black seems less irritating in GCI but the films wastes the rest of its unused cast.A clumsy panda bear becomes an unlikely kung fu hero when a treacherous enemy spreads chaos throughout the countryside in this animated martial arts adventure featuring the voices of Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, and Jackie Chan.On the surface, Po (voice of Black) may look like just another portly panda bear, but beneath his fur he bears the mark of the chosen one. By day, Po works faithfully in his family's noodle shop, but by night he dreams of becoming a true master of the martial arts. Now an ancient prophecy has come to pass, and Po realizes that he is the only one who can save his people from certain destruction. with time running short and malevolent snow leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane ) closing in, Furious Five legends Tigress (Jolie), Crane (David Cross ), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu), Monkey (Chan), and their wise sensei, Master Shifu (Hoffman), all draw on their vast knowledge of fighting skills in order to transform a lumbering panda bear into a lethal fighting machine. Now, if the noble Po can master the martial arts and somehow transform his greatest weaknesses into his greatest strengths, he will fulfill his destiny as the hero who saved his people during their darkest hour.With its negatives looming, Kung Fu Panda still manages to do better than thoses DreamWorks disasters (Madagascar, Shark Tale) and while it didn't quite live up to the hype, and it won't do anything with the release of WALL-E. Kung Fu Panda is a great kids movie with several laughs that will even have the tightest ass hole laughing.It's in the superb visuals and the fact that Kung Fu Panda really did try. It excels, but not enough to be noticed. It works however as a decent enough bridge to WALL-E, while its a crying shame that a film devoted to hard work simply cant stride far enough to be something truly spectacular. My final verdict? Give it ago, but don't go in expecting Shrek 2 or erm ... any other good DreamWorks animations? No? Oh well.",6,2,6,1 July 2008
Star Trek," Boldly going where no other Trek film has gone before
","Boldly going where no other Star Trek movie has gone before. Upon coming out of the new J.J. Abrahams I felt both joyful and saddened. Joyful because this is, very easily, the best thing I've seen this year and saddened because it may have just replaced Wrath of Kahn as my favourite Star Trek movie of all time. Seriously folks it's just that good. For anybody who doesn't know the general outline this new Trek movie works both in and out of the continuity of the original series. Mission: Impossible III director and Alias creator J.J. Abrams resurrects the classic science fiction franchise created by Gene Roddenberry with this feature film that embraces the rich history of the influential television and film series while also exploring some uncharted territory. Heroes star Zachary Quinto assumes the role of the Federation Starfleet lieutenant and Vulcan made famous in the original series by Leonard Nimoy (who also appears in an older incarnation of his original role), Spock, with Anton Yelchin stepping into the role of USS Enterprise navigator Pavel Chekov, Zoe Saldana assuming the role of communications officer Uhura, Simon Pegg keeping the ship in top shape as chief engineer Montgomery Scott (aka 'Scotty'), and Eric Bana tormenting the benevolent space explorers as the villainous Nero. Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle co-star John Cho also boards the Enterprise as Hikaru Sulu, with Chris Pine and Karl Urban assuming the legendary roles of Captain Kirk and Leonard 'Bones' McCoy, respectively.The summer officially stars here; forget what happened last week, as far as I'm concerned last week's 'bad star' could have very easily been erased from my memory after watching this. This is everything and more that a Trek fans could have asked for flawless in its execution of its characters, battles and dialogue. Granted if you've never seen an episode of Star Trek in your life (god help you) and you feels repulsed by the very thought of sitting down and watching this movie, don't be. This works equally as well for newcomers as it does for fans flitting in between of spectacular set piece to yet another spectacular set piece the true heart and nature of the film becomes present, the love between Uhura and Spock becomes tender and the as the troubled friendship between Spock and Kirk becomes more prominent even those who fail to see the emotional drive in the series will undoubtedly notice it hear. The main feat that this movie accomplishes, and a one that I doubted it for, is its casting. I mean Karl Urban as Bones, you've gotta be kidding me? Holy crap Karl Urban is Bones. It's that astonishment that left me with shivers as every actor nails each of their performance with grace and passion, even if they didn't look like their TV show counterparts they embody what it means to be that character.'Live long, and Prosper.' Calling the special effects groundbreaking is a huge understatement; the visuals are exciting, refreshing and filled with such flair you would get from a less competent director. They blend seamlessly within their environments (unlike Wolverine) adding a sense of atmosphere rather than to simply look pretty, this is how you use special effects to tell a story. And what a story it is. If there were ever a series that were devoted to certain the best story possible it would most certainly be the Star Trek series. The plot is crafted with grace and complexity throwing plot twists at us left right and centre and not to mention what could possibly be the greatest cameo of all time by none other than Spock himself. All of which works a charm up against a beautifully orchestrated score that echoes with the same majesty that the film carries. Bringing together what could very easily be the greatest movie this summer.Those who will nod knowingly (or shiver with excitement) at the appearance of Captain Pike or the reference to dilitheum crystals and those who remember that Sulu can fence will be reassured that any anomalies or inconsistencies with canon are cleverly explained away and by the appearance of one key member of the original cast. Those who are new to the franchise will be reassured that the story is self-contained. They may wonder why people applaud and laugh at a few in-jokes or the inevitable origins moments of first encounters between characters whose future interactions and relationships are as well known as their own (possibly better), but there is so much happening on screen they will not have time to wonder what they are missing. Indeed, there is so much that I have seen it twice already and look forward to seeing it again. I loved it so much I wanted to Vulcan mind meld with it.Verdict: The best movie of the year? Most likely! The best movie of the summer? Undoubtedly! Star Trek is safe with its properties yet extraordinarily entertaining. Director J.J. Abrams hits it straight out into hyper space. Anyone left reeling after years of not having a Trek film to drool over, your wait is finally over. An epic adventure that deftly captures the spirit of the original series, while succeeding utterly in charting a new course. For my overall rating I give Star Trek an outstanding 5/5.",10,2,13,9 May 2009
Inglourious Basterds," The ultimate cinema basted is back but is it cinema bliss or a total miss?
","It's been a long time coming, sure some might argue that Kill Bill isn't a total mess, but for a lot of people Quentin Tarentino hasn't made a good film since Jackie Brown. Does Inglourious Basterds mark his triumphant return as king or does it just dig his grave deeper? The story takes place in Nazi occupied France and a young Jewish refugee Shosanna Dreyfus witnesses the slaughter of her family by Colonel Hans Landa. Narrowly escaping with her life, she plots her revenge several years later when German war hero Fredrick Zoller quickly takes an interest in her and arranges an illustrious movie premiere at the theatre she now runs. With the promise of every major Nazi officer in attendance, the event catches the attention of the 'Basterds', a group of Jewish-American guerrilla soldiers led by the ruthless Lt. Aldo Raine. As the relentless executioners advance and the conspiring young girl's plans are set in motion, their paths will cross for a fateful evening that will shake the very annals of history.Let's face it, the first trailer for this was terrible. It looked and sounded like kill Bill the World War II version, and true to formula it is. Oddly enough however that works to the films advantage rather than as a handicap. In Kill Bill the endless homage and references were almost unbearable. Any fan of The Shaw Brothers or Lady Snowblood could see from the second that film started who and what he was ripping off, which wouldn't have been a problem if it had been done well. reservoir Dogs, fantastic movie, total rip off of the movie 'City on Fire'. Why is it so highly touted as one of the best movies of all time? It's because Tarentino knew how to improve on the formula. With Kill Bill he did nothing but homage. Granted Inglorious Basterds isn't a fantastic movie, it's enjoyable, funny and wonderfully acted but in ten years time nobody will be referring to it as a classic. It has a lot going for it, the story is always engaging and takes several highly amusing twists that you don't see coming.So why doesn't it entirely work? For many of the same reasons Kill Bill didn't work. Tarentino is really smart about knowing what just the right about of good is. He never overdoes it and when it's good it's fantastic. That said the film features some scenes of just monotony, mostly when Eli Roth rears his head but in a movie this well polished the moments of low grade stuff sticks out a mile. Pitt is passable as Lt. Aldo Raine but it's his co star Christoph Waltz WHO BRINGS THE GOOD. He is smart, edgy and most important absolutely hysterical. What it lacks is the texture of felt life; to put it another way, you don't believe a word of it. To fans of 'pure' cinema this might not matter, because the film creates a world unto itself; it is about technique and spatial understanding, not realism. (The same defence used to be deployed by fans of Brian De Palma). But lacking that human dimension, the QT effect will always come up short. He's a great film encyclopaedist, which is somewhat different from a great film-maker.QT's bullet-speed banter is back (although without the modern pop references, obviously), firing out a hail of comedy moments, with rat-a-tat regularity. The opening act feels like a spaghetti western, as we're introduced to the film's star man, Nazi officer and ace 'Jew hunter' Landa (Christoph Waltz's scene-stealing moments are brimming with malice and ominous humour), before picking up pace as a war flick with the unleashing of the Basterds, a brutal Dirty Dozen who carve swastikas onto the faces of their foes. The director's signature flourishes – close-ups of female feet, biting barroom banter and the Mexican stand-off – all get a fresh and funny update. The soundtrack's decent, too.Verdict: Tarentino's back but not quite on top form. This is undoubtedly the best film he has made this decade but something feels out of place whether it be the underuse of the bastards or the stilted first act this is no Pulp Fiction. It is, however, a good film full of, as I like to put it 'F*ck Yeahs'. it will have you hooting and hollering until the final credits roll. The picture contains all the things his fans like about Tarantino -- the wit, the audacity but at the very same time it leaves in everything we don't favour him for. Hopefully next time he can iron out the wrinkles. 3/5.",6,9,21,25 August 2009
Hostel," Think Cabin Fever was bad? Roth's back with more sick sh*t.
","A predictable Eli Roth movie. Which basically means you're better off watching something else. After being boasted as 'the sickest thing you will ever see' by blabber mouth director. I wasn't looking forward to this after the disappointment which was cabin fever but me and some friends decided to go and see it anyway. Maybe we should of thought twice. The story is that while backpacking through Europe, college students Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Derek Richardson) seek the ultimate vacation through sex, drugs and unforgettable experiences. When a friendly stranger informs the two of a hostel in Bratislava that offers the most beautiful and promiscuous women in all of Europe, Paxton and Derek trek with their new Icelandic friend Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson) to find the hostel that sounds too good to be true. When arriving to Bratislava, the trio found that the hostel was everything and more of what they expected. The events that follow are sure to deliver the unforgettable vacation that the two were looking for. Mystery, suspense and fear direct this film to its bloody ending. Hostel has a great idea, sick but great it's just too bad it was brought to the screen in with such a shoddy attempt.I was expecting cheap thrills and I got cheap thrills, but those cheap thrills came along with one of the most cheesy, tacky and stupid movie I have seen. This film is not once sophisticated. And not even that gory. His movie is completely charmless and probably more of a disappointment than Cabin Fever. The actors aren't terrible but they aren't anything special, the constant boobs! Are unnecessary and is just a time waster. The characters were annoying and you truly didn't give a damn what happened to any of them! Please just avoid this film.Its Eli Roth's exercise in car crash cinema and boy does it crash and burn. The only real thing Hostel manages to get right is the shameless promotional attempt by putting master director Quentin Tarentino (Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction) on the front cover which is sure to make movie goers part with their money. Please I urge you this is no more than a rental and even that's pushing its luck. Blabbermouth Director Roth has done it again.Cabin Fever still remains one of the dullest duds ever made. He promised us blood we got humour. Now it has a friend to join it. Hostel is equally (Unintentionally Funny) as a run of the mill horror film 'Hostel' does no wrong. But for reel spills and chills your best off watching something masterfully crafted and even mildly gripping. Two things Hostel lacks.It's interesting premise aside I can't really say anything productive about Hostel. This really isn't anything that you haven't seen a hundred times this year. What's even scarier is the sequel prepped for 20-07 meaning Roth gets to splash some more blood around. It's a good money maker so I wouldn't be surprised if this series keeps going much like the highly worn Saw series.",2,0,2,8 June 2008
Public Enemies," Manns back...
","Michael Mann is a guy I've looked up to for some time now. He is indisputably one of the greatest film makers of our time and has provided the world with some ground breaking films. Let's forget 2006's hiccup that was the Miami Vice movie and feast upon his latest offering, Public Enemies. But is Mann turning up the heat, or is it collateral damage.Based on author Bryan Burrough's ambitious tome Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933-43, director Michael Mann's sprawling historical crime drama follows the efforts of top FBI agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale ) in capturing notorious bank robber John Dillinger. A folk hero to the American public thanks to his penchant for robbing the banks that many people believed responsible for the Great Depression, charming bandit Dillinger (Johnny Depp) was virtually unstoppable at the height of his criminal career; no jail could hold him, and his exploits endeared him to the common people while making headlines across the country. J. Edgar Hoover's (Billy Crudup) FBI was just coming into formation, and what better way for the ambitious lawman to transform his fledgling Bureau of Investigation into a national police force than to capture the gang that always gets away? It was the movies that killed John Dillinger -- Gangster No. 1 until he was gunned down outside a Chicago theatre after taking in the pictures one hot night in 1934 -- and it was the movies that brought him back to life. More than once. But this time it's different. This time Michael Mann is in charge. This is undoubtedly a Michael Mann film. From the intense close ups to the thrilling soundtrack its clear who's running the show. And boy if he doesn't do it near perfectly. This is masterful direction on his part; each scene is pitch perfect and balanced to the point that there isn't a speck of dirt on camera, in this aspect Public Enemies soars. Unfortunately the film does have some technical issues, none of which are large enough to take you out of the movie, but at times the audio editing is, jumpy to say the least. One minute we have guns blazing defining anybody sitting in the aisle seats, other times speech is misheard as the characters speak lines so softly it's easy to misinterpretation.As far as the look of the film, it's absolutely phenomenal. Shot entirely on digital, which seems to be Mann's new forte, the picture looks crisp, clear and utterly classy. Sporting some unparalleled cinematography that encapsulate 1930's Chicago, there no denying that Public Enemies is the best looking film of 2009. The acting is nothing below extraordinary with favourite Johnny Depp and Christian Bale recovering from the rough patch they been through recently. This is them back on form and better than ever. Oscar Winner Marion Cotillard delivers a solid is underused performance.Verdict: Public Enemies shows Michael Mann's steady recovery from 2006's Miami Vice, there are a couple of casual bugs, the sound can be dreadful at time but for the most part Public Enemies shines as one of 2009s brightest gems and could be up for some serious awards come Oscar time. The running time may scare some and with it being a Michael Mann film it's definitely not for everybody but for thoses who appreciate his style of movie making, this is all for you. A stunning, sumptuous sensation that acts as one of my favourite films of 2009.",10,2,7,3 July 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Talk about a Shaggy Dog story...
","Sharp claws, cheep cigars, cheesy one liners? Have I seen this movie before? Thought so! Its round four for the X-Men and with the mutant franchise over it's about time we check the personal files on our protagonists with 'X-Men Origins' This origin story tells the tale of Wolverine, the most prominent of the X-Men, and also the one that headlines all three of the previous film. Which brings up the films biggest flaw. Relevance. The problem is that Wolverine is a character that, in layman's terms had been done to death. A fourth film in which he headlines is abnoxsiouse, repetitive and insanely dull. The only pleasure fans will get is from the vast array of new characters most interesting of which is the criminally underused Dead pool (Ryan Reynolds). Is it an awful movie? Not really. The phrase below par seems adequate here. Its feels rushed, undercooked yet overblown at the same time. The action scenes are admirable at best blending real backgrounds with some of the ugliest CGI I've ever laid my eves upo¬n. The gruff, steel-clawed Marvel superhero Wolverine strikes out on his own in this X-Men spin-off starring series regular Hugh Jackman. The film is set up as an origin tale for the character, and will find him sharing the screen with Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), Gambit (Taylor Kitsch), John Wraith (will.i.am), Victor Creed/Sabretooth (Liev Schreiber), and Col. William Stryker (Danny Huston). Academy Award-winning director Gavin Hood (Tsotsi) films a screenplay penned by Troy scribe David Benioff. Daniel Henney and Lost's Dominic Monaghan round out the supporting cast.What works for the movie are twofold, it's simple structure is fool proof. There isn't a second where you'll get lost and it acts as an idiots guide to the series, obviously causing a problem for readers of the X-men comics. It's insanely undemanding leaving skipping key events and undermining characters that should play a pivotal role. None of which is going to matter to the passing movie goer. The acting is a step up for the series with bright spark Danny Huston taking over from Brian Cox as William Stryker. Liev Schreiber, a personal favourite of mine, plays Sabretooth with a veracious and cold nature and is only ever stumbles when he is stricken with poor dialogue. Here is where the film falls flat on its face, granted the series is well known for its campy dialogue - (anyone remember the Juggernaut) - here the dialogue is so underwritten and textbook that its almost uncomfortable to watch each character stagger over every line they deliver.It's a shame really, if anyone remembers director Gavin Hood's previous work (Rendition, Tsotsi) then you'll know he is capable of great things. With this it doesn't show. His direction is lost in a haze of special effects and poorly choreographed fight sequences. Never before have I wanted Bryan Singer to get behind the wheel. The film runs at approximately 107 minutes, which is at best 20 minutes too long. Granted this movie is aimed more at the younger children than it is at me. Maybe I'm just too old for this, but if old man Logan were watching this I'm pretty sure he'd have a thing or two to say. Which brings up the concluding point, this is a film designed to repel fans boys. It placates to those in the need for a mindless actioner without any complex narrative, if you've never picked up a comic in your life, by all means go have fun. The rest of us will have to wait until next time to get the origin story we deserve.Verdict: At best Wolverine is undemanding, placating to an audience too young to appreciate the comics it's based upon. The older audiences will only turn their nose at the poor fight choreography, drastically drab visuals and a story so effortless it for shames that of its video game counterpart. This clunky prequel doesn't even make an effort to maintain a semblance of balance between story and spectacle, characters and special effects. For my overall rating I give X-Men Origins: Wolverine an unenthusiastic 2/5.",2,13,28,29 April 2009
Terminator Salvation," Hasta La Vista Baby
","He promised he'd be back, and four movies on the Terminator franchise is starting to look rusty. Will it be worth going back for another look into the future, or is it hasta la vista baby for this series? From what we saw in the trailer it's clear that this isn't your average Terminator movies. While the first three were primarily chase movies in which our protagonists were forced to escape and oncoming Terminator. Here it's a full frontal battle movie, everything you remember from the opening sequence of the original movies with the grown John Conner, that is this movie. With one major difference. The originals gave us a sense of envy, Conner was a person given little screen time, very screen time we longed for. Here were given it and I almost feel selfish in saying, we really didn't need this. Bale is the main problem, as much as I love Batman, I feel erroneous to even be saying this but, Christian Bale is atrocious in this movie. It's almost as if it's Bale playing Batman playing John Conner, his excessive tone that makes the movie hard to take serious, even for a Terminator film.Call me jaded but the reason the first films work so wells is because of their pacing, they create a sense of pathos to begin with only to release hell upon our protagonists, and here the pace is near gone. Playing like your average video game rip off its nothing more than one looming set piece to the other. Don't get me wrong the film looks incredible and McG creates a formidable vision of the future with survival the main priority. Unfortunately any sense of trepidation is tarnished by dreadful one lines that feel out of place in the grand scheme of things, the supporting cast do an admirable job of keeping the foundations of the film upright, Sam Worthington giving and impressive attempt and managing to resonate where other do not, if I didn't know any better I would have had him take Bales place as Conner, but that's just me.Though competent in its B-movie way, Terminator Salvation lacks the humour, heart-tugging moments and visual pleasure that made the first two movies of the series modern pop masterpieces.Set in post-apocalyptic 2018, John Connor is the man fated to lead the human resistance against Skynet and its army of Terminators. But the future Connor was raised to believe in is altered in part by the appearance of Marcus Wright, a stranger whose last memory is of being on death row. Connor must decide whether Marcus has been sent from the future, or rescued from the past. As Skynet prepares its final onslaught, Connor and Marcus both embark on an odyssey that takes them into the heart of Skynet's operations, where they uncover the terrible secret behind the possible annihilation of mankind. The story is typical fare, including several Terminator time-loops that give the film purpose but no real goal. With no antagonist to fear the film feels pointless, and with a protagonist that you're unable to relate to it acts emotionless. Untimely leading to an unbalanced film. Granted this is a film director by McG, (Charlie's Angels) and for a McG film you get everything you're expected to, the battle scenes are exciting and stimulating while the final 20 minutes a untouchable run that acts as the films strongest point. None of which really matter when taken into context. Sure we get to see everything we came there to see but It all happens in the last 20 minutes and trust me it's a long excruciating wait tarnished with disastrous plot holes, some of the worst dialogue of the summer and character that are so underdeveloped that it would shame that of 'Wolverine' Change was inevitable—the established Terminator formula has been squeezed dry in FOX's prime-time The Sarah Conner Chronicles. But among the many things junked in McG's chop-shop is the notion of pleasure: The director describes cutting that 'gratuitous moment of a girl taking her top off in an action picture' (God forbid) to get a franchise-first PG-13. He does, however, begin his film with the hook of Worthington clammily kissing a vampire-complexioned, bald-pated Helena Bonham Carter. Bale, doing the 'Grrr' voice, is a lesson in how clenched effort does not equal effect. What's remarkable about his leaked freakout—mostly embarrassing in revealing a director who can't Alpha up on his set—is that it's over a performance in McG's 'Terminator Salvation.' Did the dude sweat this much over Reign of Fire? Verdict: Stylish but shallow, action-packed but without ever being exciting, Terminator Salvation is a movie that looked amazing as a trailer, but doesn't stand up as a 115 minute film. Bales performance is one note and shockingly dismal and it's obvious that this Terminator is showing some rust. The movie suffers from an inevitable tedium, which can best be summarized as: bang-bang-bang; pow, pow; fireball, fireball; ka-boom! It neither adds to nor subtracts from the mythology. And with Judgment Day upon us, there's no more tension, nothing compelling left to explore. By the time Arnie shows up your mind is already made up. For my overall review I give Terminator Salvation 2/5.",4,0,2,8 June 2009
500 Days of Summer," 500 Days isn't enough
","(500) Days of Summer is a simple story of boy meets girl. The boy Tom Hanson (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) believed his whole life that he wouldn't be happy until he found the one. The girl Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) did not share this believe. Were told right off the bat that this is not a love story. Its is however intensely personal, for anybody who has ever experienced unrequited love, which is likely to be a large proportion of the people who were sitting in the cinema. Its a romantic comedy for all extensive purposes, but unlike you've ever seen before. (500) Days of Summer reverses the roles usually associated with character tropes and places Tom as its starry eyed dreamer who believes that true love is just around the corner. Summer, played the dude in this situation. She is just out to have fun and as a consequence they both end up in a destructive relationship.Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel star in director Mark Weber's wry, non-linear romantic comedy about a man who falls head over heels for a woman who doesn't believe in love. Mark (Gordon Levitt) is an aspiring architect who currently earns his living as a greeting card writer. Upon encountering his boss' beautiful new secretary Summer (Deschanel), Mark discovers that the pair have plenty in common despite the fact that she's seemingly out of his league; for starters, they both love The Smiths, and they're both fans of surrealist artist Magritte. Before long Mark is smitten. All he can think about is Summer. Mark believes deeply in the concept of soul mates, and he's finally found his. Unfortunately for Mark, Summer sees true love as the stuff of fairy tales, and isn't looking for romance. Undaunted and undeterred by his breezy lover's casual stance on relationships, Mark summons all of his might and courage to pursue Summer and convince her that their love is real.The film does an excellent job of creating its own sense of style. Before every outing we would see the day we going to. Their break up occurs withing the hundreds and therefore every time it passes that mark were prepared for tears and tantrums. Marc Webb (director) has made an outstanding movie, one that will make my top ten list by the end of the year, mainly due the the raw reality of it. You see a argument occur and its so realistic it almost becomes uncomfortable. Fortunatly the films wins you back round with its quirky sense of humor which had me in sticks constantly. The film seems to have a lot going for it, a great sense of realism, hilarious moments and some impeccable direction and characterization. Its a stunner on many levels none more so than the acting. Both Deschanel and Levitt do an outstanding job at being the fun likable characters the are at the start of the time line and then there almost seamless descent into struggling human beings. They bring life what could have been lifeless characters.Webb's direction is an absolute joy throughout, presenting the story in a series of inventive and original scenes that will stay with you long after you leave the cinema. Highlights include: a split-screen sequence that puts the reality of a party up against Tom's expectations; a French art-house film parody; and a simple but breathtakingly brilliant sequence where Webb uses the same four snapshot clips of Summer to illustrate both things Tom loves about her and later, things he hates about her. The tag line for the film sums it up perfectly: 'Boy meets Girl. Boy falls in love. Girl doesn't.' In addition, the narration insists early on that this is not a typical romcom; instead it's a beautifully written, modern day reworking of Annie Hall that will strike a chord with anyone who's ever had their heart broken. Needless to say, it also has a terrific soundtrack.Verdict: 500 days inst long enough. The warm friendly glow of this romantic comedy mixed with the harsh reality of life makes for something we haven't seen in a very long time. A charming, funny and wonderfully inventive romcom that's easily one of the best films of the year. It is so absolutely adorable that, as the ending credits were rolling, I had the overwhelming urge to wrap my arms around the movie and never let it go. 5/5.",10,1,3,26 September 2009
The Day After Tomorrow," Highly entertaining first-half let down by dull second-half.
","Director Roland Emmerich of Independence Day and the shoddy Godzilla Remake fame brings us probably the least accurate but best looking global warming warning to date. Don't worry just yet, Emmerich clearly hasn't got his facts right but this is a movie and for entertainment purposes he must e3xagerate a little. A 30ft tidal wave sweeping through Manhattan? Most of Britain under ice? Tornados in Hollywood? It's a tad stretched but for what it's worth the first 40 minutes of The Day After Tomorrow are sheep brilliance dabbling into emotion and not being afraid to dazzle with its monuments effects.It's a crying shame then that once those 40 minutes are up the film revels its dull serious side. Jumping from unconvincing problem to unconvincing problem back upped by the ultimately charisma drained Dennis Quaid and a forgivably forgettable performance form Jake Gyllenhal makes The Day After Tomorrow a very mixed bag.Directed by Roland Emmerich, this mega-budget, special-effects-laden epic revolves around the onset of an international series of crises brought on by the long-term results of the greenhouse effect.At the eye of the storm is paleoclimatologist (a professor dedicated to the study of weather patterns throughout the ages) Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), who voluntarily takes on the preservation of the world in voluntarily takes on the preservation of the world in the dawn of the next ice age and all the disaster that comes along with it -- violent hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, tidal waves, massive floods, etc.Hall must also contact his son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhal), who was in the middle of an academic competition in New York City when the chaos begun. In addition to facing the largest-scale onslaught of natural catastrophes in the history of humankind, Jack, in his journey north, must contend with the masses fleeing south in an attempt to resettle in a warmer climate. The Day After Tomorrow also features Emma Rossum, Sela Ward, and Joe Cobden. All of whom do a respectable job at providing the often much needed support.Director Roland Emmerich has had his ups and he has had his downs. Anybody's whose read my 10,000 BC review will know what I mean by downs and what with that terrible Godzilla remake still leaving a mark its odd how the director of the critically acclaimed Independence Day can sink to such a low quality. With The Day After Tomorrow despite its flaws it does enter the group marked the Directors best what with this and Independence Day being his only real success.My Final Verdict? If only this movie were 40 minutes long then maybe the ending wouldn't be so darn dull. Even still this is entertaining viewing that should not be missed but never should be taken seriously. Global Warming truly isn't such a problem.",6,1,2,8 June 2008
Spider-Man 3," I'm so sorry spidey, this just didn't work.
","Spider-man 2 is still the finest thing to come out of Marvel. It's a dazzling achievement in action cinema. That never takes itself too seriously and, though I may have reconsidered at times is, is fully deserving of its five star review. This and the fact that Part cone was a very good film means it's so excruciatingly painful for me to give this film a bad review.But a critics gotta do what a critics gotta do. It's a pretty lousy film focusing solely on the development of Parker and MJ which is far more irritating than you'd expect. Naturally spider-man 3 looks amazing. Its stunningly well made. But like many of 2007's outing it's a hollow attraction. Spidey 3 is neither as dark or as important as the trailers make it seem. Its merely a series of events with no purpose and much like Shrek the third suffers massively in comparison to its predecessors. Really spider-man 3 is just action packed nonsense that will leave the eyes dazzled but the heart 8unmoved and won't have you reaching into your wallet any time soon.Your friendly neighbourhood web-slinger is back, only this time his sunny outlook has become partially overcast in the third chapter of director Sam Ramie's Spider-Man saga. Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco return to reprise their roles from the previous two instalments, with Thomas Haden Church, Topher Grace, and Bryce Dallas Howard making their first appearances in the series as Flint Marko (aka Sandman), Eddie Brock (aka Venom), and Gwen Stacy, respectively. Peter Parker (Maguire) has finally learned to walk the middle ground between being the superhero that his city needs, and the man that Mary Jane (Dunst) loves. All is well in New York City until one night, as Peter and M.J. set gazing at the stars, a falling comet streams across the sky and crashes into the ground close by.But this isn't any ordinary shooting star, and upon impact the mysterious space rock is split open to reveal a shape-shifting symbiotic with the power to overtake anything that it comes into contact with. Later, as Harry Osborn acquires his late father's flying board, engineers a powerful new Goblin outfit, and takes to the sky to avenge dad's death, the mysterious space sludge infects both Peter's Spider Man suit and ambitious street photographer Eddie Brock (Grace). His strange new suit giving him a newfound sense of power as it gradually overpowers his personality, Peter discovers that escaped convict Flint Marko was in fact the man responsible for the death of Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson). Unfortunately for Peter, Marko has recently acquired the power to morph at will and quickly completes his transformation into the dreaded Sandman.The citizens of New York City must once again call on Spider Man to fend off destructive forces that are far too powerful for the likes of mortal man.In all Spider-Man 3 is far more of a chore than a film, forgetting the simplistic beauty of the first and adding so many webs it's hard not to get tangled. The best advice I could give you is not to expect Spider-Man 2 you'll only be disappointed.",4,0,1,8 June 2008
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Hell, this film is absolutely golden.
","Never before have I witnessed such eye popping visual combined with such in depth character. Del Toro knows his movies. He crafts each and every one of them with the characters in mind. He won't have his Hellboy, for one second; feel out of place in this universe. And just like Christopher Nolan did for Gotham City, Del Toro does for this utopia of trolls, elves and demons. Now as much as I enjoyed the first Hellboy it did have its flaws namely its predictable plotting. And while part two manages to take all of the best parts of its predecessor and magnify it by one hundred it still isn't able to fix its plotting. The story feels a little tired, as if we've been here all before.All of which very minor grips considering this films main intentions. As an summer action flick Hellboy II really does no wrong. It's a beautifully made, cleverly hilarious characterisation flick that really allows you to connect with (though maybe not all of its characters) most of its characters. You have got to give Del Toro credit for breathing life and soul into these creations making this feel like a living comic book. Trust me fan boys will not be disappointed with the opulent colours that are sure-fire to dazzle you to the very last frame.Ron Perlman returns to the role of the big red BPRD agent in this sequel to 2004's Hellboy, directed once again by Guillermo del Toro and scripted as before in collaboration with original Hellboy creator Mike Mignola. For centuries, an ancient truce has kept the naïve citizens of the human race safe from the horrors of the invisible realm -- but that's all about to change, and fast. A ruthless leader has emerged in the invisible realm, a tyrant just as comfortable walking the surface realm as he is living in the land of fantasy. When this power-mad ruler defies his bloodline to assemble an unstoppable army of fantastical creatures that he will use to wage a supernatural war on humanity, it begins to appear that humankind's days are numbered.Suspend you disbelief for two hours and you'll be able to enjoy this ultra silly but good spirit action flick so ingeniously combined with in depth characters all bringing stunningly realism and top notch humour. More than anything, this film makes us eager for Del Toro's next announced project, J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit, in which the director's prodigious gifts will be combined with one of the great fantasy franchises of modern times. That should really be something to see.VERDICT: For fans of the series this film is absolutely golden. Its characters effortlessly taken from the pages of the ever loved comic books. In fact if nobody told you this was a movie it would be very easy to think you were watching a moving comic book. Though Hellboy II is certainly not without its flaws. A lagging plot that seems often muddled in ambition and a Golden Army awakened for a five minute battle sequence are very minor complaints in a film that is made for the cinema. A stunning achievement.",8,2,7,14 August 2008
Cloverfield," This beastie could teach Godzilla a thing or two.
","The trailer was amazing, the buzz was huge, the end result is admirable. Cloverfield isn't without its flaws however and there are some massive plot holes but such cant dull down the sheer voracity of the film. Blaring with sound and visuals make Cloverfield an utterly surreal experience. It's more like a roller-coaster than movie. Taking you on a momentous journey that differs from the underground to towering skyscrapers. The truth is that Cloverfield is always enjoyable. There is not one moment throughout that you won't be balancing on the edge of your seat.The realism displayed throughout the film mainly comes from the was its been shot. The shaky camera technique last seen in The Blair Witch Project allows full exploration of New York after An alien attack with no exceptions. This is free form film making at its very best. A few questions do come up during the movie. For example the perplexing condition known as the virus that pops up for a brief moment but is never fully explained and I'm sure it will make for an interesting premise for the inescapable sequel. Still when the thing that should be festering in your mind is the high octane and brilliantly relentless action, you'll find that the unexplained infection keeps on coming back to you. It's also a shame that the trailer for Cloverfield is substantially scarier than the final result. Those who were expecting an adrenalin filled experience will be pleased those expecting a sophisticated horror won't.There's also the small matter of a rather unsatisfying third act. Sure the film does need to calm down eventually but the ending is worryingly abrupt. I hear critics complain about the wafer thin plot, sure I'm not denying that but clearly those very critics have never seen a B-movie before. The wafer thin plot simply allows for more action sequences, a good thing if you ask me. And you're reading my review so ill assume you are.Producer J.J. Abrams teams with writer Drew Goddard and director Matt Reeves for this frenetic tale of a powerful destructive force that descends upon New York City, and the four desperate survivors who put their lives on the line to embark on a perilous rescue mission.As for our beastie, no signs of CGI suffocation that the far inferior I am Legend suffered from, and what makes it even better is our monster is truly frightening. The very symbolism of 21st Century apocalyptic nature. Don't be fooled by the overlong and often boring opening in. It will start soon enough. And with a rather short 87 minutes you'll wonder how it packed so much action into such a short space of time.A surreal, tense but most of all relentless cinematic experience. Following in the footsteps of The Blair Witch Project allowing far more freedom to explore the sheer devastation of New York after an alien invasion. Some questions are left unanswered but noting too major witch means you can get on and enjoy the film",8,1,2,8 June 2008
Gone Baby Gone," Back, baby, back. The greatest film of 2007 bar none
","A film director by Ben Affleck starring Casey Affleck great new talent) about a subject so fragile that sensitive viewers will be crying after the first 20 minutes. But in these hard times, what with the disappearance of Madelyn McCain it seems the only think that will have us conquer our fear of kidnapping is to face it. And what better way to do such things than see this sensitive but hard-hitting and far from cliqued kidnapping story that is simply too much for some.A directorial triumph for the so-so actor who is clearly much better at directing than he is at acting (just take a look at Pearl Harbour) But even in this where our attention is so fixed on whether or not Ben will be able to cut it as a director our attention seems to be shifted to Casey Affleck who is without a doubt one of my favourite up and coming stars, much better than his brother at least. He treats the subject with such care it's impossible not to like his character, as an actor his is stupendous. Absolutely marvelous.The tough private eye Patrick Kenzie was raised in a poor and dangerous neighborhood of Boston, and works with his partner and girlfriend Angie Gennaro generally tracking missing losers in debt.When the four year-old Amanda McCready is abducted from her apartment, her aunt Beatrice 'Bea' McCready calls the police and the press, and the case is highlighted with the spots by the media. Then Bea hires the reluctant Patrick to work in the case because he is not a cop and based on his great knowledge of their neighborhood. Meanwhile Capt. Jack Doyle, who lost his own daughter many years ago and is in charge of the investigation, assigns detectives Remy Bressant and Nick Pole to give the necessary support to Patrick.After interviewing the addicted low life mother of Amanda, Helene McCready, Patrick goes to a bar and discloses that Helene was on the streets with her boyfriend Skinny Ray Likanski dealing and using drugs on the day Amanda disappeared. Along his investigation, Patrick faces small time criminals, drug dealers, paedophiles and corruption, facing a moral issue to solve the case. Shocked? In a state of stress? And hell you haven't even seen the movie yet.Who should see this? Intelligent people. People who want to come out of a movie thinking about what they just saw. People who want to see an incredibly well made film.It's also one of those rare movies in which it can easily be said that the less you know about the story going in, the richer the experience. There's no clear twist ending to give away, but rather a layered story that unfolds like a Russian stacking doll with a moral dilemma at its core.My final verdict? Its most likely the best film of 2007. It's definitely part of my top 50 greatest of all time. And unmissable well crafted film that demands your attention even if the subject is to hard to face. A well rounded cast and a beautiful story is merely the tip of the iceberg. Go see it now.",10,0,0,10 June 2008
21," 21, that's how many minutes it will take until you walk out.
","If there were ever an award for a film so committed at making gambling seem so unbearably dull then it would go to 21.It plays like a cross between 'The O.C' and 'Lucky You' on anit-depressant. Its cast are barely noticeable providing solid but forgettable performances. Instead of going all out 21 plays it really safe meaning there isn't much progressing at all. This is an absolute waste of money for anybody who isn't committed to sit through two hours of absolute nothing. It even manages to make gambling boring.Our lead man, Jim Sturgess (Across the Universe) puts up with a dry uninteresting script and tries to make something out of it. Its only real attraction ho0wever are Laurence Fishburne and Kevin Spacey who if you ask me can do a hell of a lot better than this. Its beautifully shot with some spectacular cinematography but like a lot of 2008 outings 21 is a good looking dud that pilots down the runway but never takes off.Director Robert Luketic adapts Ben Mezrich's best-seller Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions to tell the true-life tale of six genius students who used their brains to beat considerable odds. Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) may be shy, but his wallflower reputation betrays his inner brilliance. As smart as Ben may be, however, if he can't pay his his tuition he'll be kicked out of M.I.T. Fortunately, the answer to all of Ben's problems is right there in the cards. Recruited to join a team of extremely gifted students who have used their mastery of numbers to beat the odds at blackjack, Ben procures a fake identity in order to join the casino scammers and their brilliant leader -- eccentric math professor and stats genius Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey) -- in some highly profitable weekend excursions to Las Vegas. Counting cards isn't illegal, and by using a complex series of signals, this team has cracked the code.Of course, it doesn't take long for Ben to become seduced by the glamorous Las Vegas lifestyle, and the attention afforded to him by his sexy teammate teammate Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth) finds him pushing his luck to the absolute limits. Laurence Fishburne stars as Cole Williams, the Sin City security chief who catches on to the group and makes it his mission to expose their lucrative blackjack scam.There isn't much more for me to say only that even if the plot synopsis might excite you really don't bother with it. Its 30 minutes too long, and even at that its one of the dullest outing of 2008. Avoid at all costs. My Final Verdict? Is that 21 is a poor adaption of Ben Mezrich's best seller and if you're looking for a good gambling film your best off stick to Oceans 11 starring George Clooney. A film that isn't afraid to take chances and that actually manages a few smiles.",2,10,17,8 June 2008
The Orphanage," Spanish chiller reminiscing to classics like the Haunting, truly outstanding.
","You wouldn't believe how refreshing it is to sit down a watch a horror movie that doesn't fully rely on gore to thrill. We are living in an age where this so called 'Gorno' rules the horror genre and to be perfectly honest I'm pretty sick of it. Fortunately 'The Orphanage' is set to end this vicious cycle once and for all. A genuinely terrifying thriller that knows its audience. Using the traditional 'ghost story' plotting for its devilish games. The brilliant thing is that this is a horror movie that generates character sand raw emotion allowing its audience to be captivated by its powerful presence.Unfairly dubbed as 'The new Pans Labyrinth' giving it a lot to live up to. As far as far as I'm concerned this is a timeless horror classic. Filled with jump out of your skin moments and truly hair raising suspense. Not to mention the tear jerker of an ending that will have even the most stubborn of viewer trying to avoid crying. For such a typical and worn story it's a wonder how Juan crafted so many original plot twists and moments of shock when you would naturally think you know the tricks of the trade.Rueda character Laura is not only fully relatable but also very human, far from your typical blond provided by most horror flicks our generation gives us. She is a late-thirty something who returns - along with her husband Carlos and adopted son Simon  to the rundown home for orphans she grew up in. She wants to re-open it as a home for kids with special needs, but she discovers her old friends might never have left as Simon is soon playing with new invisible friends.After an unnerving visit from a gaunt old lady, and untimely revelation and argument with her son, Laura's plan gets suddenly knocked awry by his disappearance. It flows beautifully, though that just might be the British perception of foreign films, the language used almost makes the film seem like a poem. That and rather haunting imagery used throughout. I remember recently buying a Spanish film of a similar nature. Guillermo Del Toro's The Devils Backbone and after seeing this realizing how great a double bill would be. What the devils backbone lack in shocks The Orphanage provides. Visa versa with plot.Therefore I do recommend you seeing The Devils Backbone before you view this only that way will you know whether you're going to like The Orphanage or not. My verdict is that if you were to miss this year's 'Pans Labyrinth' then shame on you. Filled with unforgettable images and genuine horror.This is for anyone who is sick of seeing the same old gore porn being produced each year. Don't Miss.",8,1,3,27 April 2008
Wanted," Put it on your most wanted list.
","Leave your brains at the door, you won't be needing them. Though that isn't necessarily a bad thing. For thoses tired of blockbusters pretending to be otherwise (Prince Caspian, Grindhouse) Wanted is a true breath of fresh air. A action film that knows it's an action film, and doesn't pretend to be anything more or anything less. Though a great cast and a tired but still superb plot help. But as far as action goes this is some of the most fluent and nail biting action I've seen since The Matrix all the way back in 1999.It's unlikely action hero James McAvoy who shines brighter than anybody else, though slightly irritating at the start of the movie one his kick-ass side develops he is every iota the James Bourne beta we were looking for. Though credit must go to the suburb Morgan Freeman and the shimmering Angelina Jolie who both sweep away the competition as some of the greatest action movie characters to date. Though Wanted may lack the smarts of Casino Royal of The Bourne Identity, it very easily Makes up for all of that which is lost simply because of its outstanding action sequences. Wanted is never dull and never boring and only ever silly, but who really cares about that? Night Watch director Timur Bekmambetov helms his first English-language feature film with this big-screen adaptation of Mark Millar's action-packed graphic novel. Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) is a cube-dwelling hypochondriac whose uneventful life has become a mundane blur of terminal boredom. Repeatedly humiliated by his boss and constantly cuckolded by his cheating girlfriend, weakling Wes seems to be living right down to everyone's expectations that he would never amount to anything in life. However, upon discovering that the father he never knew has been brutally murdered, the spineless, clock-punching pushover is recruited into a secret society of assassins known as the Fraternity.During the course of his training, the man who was once an office-bound wimp develops lightning-fast reflexes and superhuman dexterity courtesy of his skilled mentor Fox (Angelina Jolie). Upon completing his training, Wes is assigned the task of dealing out death to the mythological Fates, who possess the ability to alter the lifelines of mortal men.Jolie is all wolf, kohl-eyed and coldblooded. But for all her lethal skills (and drop-dead physique), there's something approachable about her. She plays Fox with a hint of sardonic remove and a touch of down-to-earth grit, as if this pumped-up killing machine hasn't forgotten what it's like to be one of the girls. She puts her cat suit on one leg at a time.All in all I thoroughly enjoyed Wanted and it ranking just behind Cloverfield as one of the greatest action flick of 2008. With only minor stumbles Wanted glides through its fluent action sequences with no problem what so ever. Though non-of us like that part where Morgan Freeman swears. He's too nice for sh*t like that.",8,8,17,8 July 2008
Monsters vs. Aliens," See it in 3D!
","Ifhere's one thing that's undeniable when it comes to DreamWorks Animation it's that its increasing in quality with every movie it makes, sure last month's Madagascar 2 wasn't quite up to snuff, but compare it to the original it may as well be Shakespeare. Kung Fu Panda couldn't hold a candle to last year's Wall-e but if you remember that this is the same studio that gave up Sharks Tale, the Panda doesn't look too shabby. So by making a film that riffs of everything I every loved about the 50's surely Monsters Vs Aliens should top them all, not quite. There are two ways to see monsters Vs Aliens, in 2D and in 3D. Which are so crucial they may as well be night and day. See it in 2D and it's a fun, forgettable animated movie that, while head and shoulders above Sharks Tale or Shrek the Third, its far from Pixar perfect. If you're lucky enough to see it in 3D, it might be one of the most entertaining experiences you'll have in the cinema all year. Calling the 3D visuals astounding is a huge understatement. Last month's Bolt looks petty in comparison, its stunning to watch and you'll get your money's worth even if it means paying full price and a little extra for the glasses.I'm afraid I might have to eat my worlds from an earlier post I did, while commenting on the new 'Up' trailer. I might have mentioned my lack of enthusiasm for DreamWorks latest offering. Calling the trailer for it, dull uninteresting and unfunny. Two of which I'll be happy to retract. It certainly isn't dull. There isn't a second during the movie I slouched over in my seat. Your entertained 100% of the time, what doesn't quite work is the jokes. The movie feels split between two major audiences. There were jokes referencing moments from movies that kids below the age of 15 are likely not to have seen (Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Mothra) with this looming to movie feels like its geared towards the audiences of film lovers who still revel in the wonders of 50's B-movies, however only seconds later were forced to sit through childish bodily functioned joke followed by a innocent giggle coming from the front row. In this sense then it pleases both audiences and deludes them at the same time, adults wont appreciate the childish fart jokes while the 50's references will escapee minors.When California girl Susan Murphy is unwittingly clobbered by a meteor full of outer space gunk on her wedding day, she mysteriously grows to 49-feet-11-inches tall. The military jumps into action and Susan is captured and secreted away to a covert government compound. There, she is renamed Ginormica and placed in confinement with a ragtag group of Monsters: the brilliant but insect-headed Dr. Cockroach, Ph.D.; the macho half-ape, half-fish The Missing Link; the gelatinous and indestructible B.O.B.; and the 350-foot grub called Insectosaurus. Their confinement is cut short, however, when a mysterious alien robot lands on Earth and begins storming the country. In a moment of desperation, the President is persuaded to enlist the motley crew of Monsters to combat the Alien Robot and save the world from imminent destruction.What's amiss is cleaver development, the films moves so fast and where rarely allowed to catch our breath to such an extent that some of the characters feel left out and excluded from what's going on. It's reassuring however that DreamWorks have made a film that both appeals to the avid movie lover in me as well as the young child. It works to an enormous extent and is a rarity that I can recommend both you and your child to go see this. You'll probably take your kids to see Monsters vs. Aliens, but you might have more fun seeing the movie without them.Verdict: Its rare i ever come across a split verdict for a movie, I'm usually set on how I feel. With this I was debating it and debating it and could come to only one conclusion.With a witty script and a collection of adorable characters, Monsters doesn't have a lot of emotional depth, but it's a well-designed crowd-pleaser. You can't go wrong if you're willing to fork out an extra couple of pounds for the 3D experience. For my overall rating I give Monsters Vs. Aliens 3D 4/5 while the 2D experience gets an enthusiastic 3/5.",7,2,5,28 March 2009
Enchanted," Disney takes the Mickey, its Amy Adams who shines through.
","Its Amy Adams movie, the audience knows it the cast knows it and Amy herself knows it. She blissfully steals every scene with her wonderful wide-eyed princess Giselle. Its just a real shame Sarandon's (perfectly cast for the wicked which) could of stayed around longer, and when she does show her face she is quickly transformed into a poorly designed GCI dragon. One of the very few problems with this very good family movie. That small children will find magical and teenagers and adults will find heart-warming.It's true, I doubt I have ever smiled this much whist watching a film making it the most enchanting outing of Christmas 2007. Stuff The Golden Compass, bin St Tinian's. The best family movie out there has to be enchanted.Its been along time since we have had an all round Disney classic. And though enchanted may not be an all rounder (putting several spins onto this worn out story) it has definitely earned the right to be called a Disney classic and Giselle a Disney princess.An animated fairy tale meets modern, live-action comedy. The beautiful princess Giselle is banished by an evil queen from her magical, musical animated land and finds herself in the gritty reality of the streets of modern-day Manhattan. Shocked by this strange new environment that doesn't operate on a 'happily ever after' basis, Giselle is now adrift in a chaotic world badly in need of enchantment. But when Giselle begins to fall in love with a charmingly flawed divorce lawyer who has come to her aid - even though she is already promised to a perfect fairy tale prince back home - she has to wonder: Can a storybook view of romance survive in the real world? There is no better feeling than when Giselle breaks out into dance half way through the film, you mouth may in fact be sore afterwards from all that smiling.The kids will plead to go see it again and you won't be reluctant to take them. It's true that Sarandon's character isn't very good, and the horrible computer generated dragon at the end is rubbish. But such criticism will disappear from your minds once the feel good ending comes into view, and the smile will reappear. For better or for worse the days of your average Disney tale are over. This isn't your usual fairytale. Its better, tanks to Amy Adams mostly.Though not without its flaws. Enchanted manages to be the biggest and best of Christmas 2007 outings. A big cheer for Adams who steals the show with Giselle. Enchanted has earned a place in our hearts, you will be more than happy to revisit this film. Truly Enchanting! There's just enough might and magic with a outstanding amount of warmth to allow enchanted to make you smile for hours on end. So much so also that its almost impossible to not forgive it for its flaws and misuse of Susan Sarandon.Enchanted takes a poll position on 2007 children's films. It's brilliant that Disney have final getting their own back on DreamWorks Shrek. What with Shrek the third being so painfully average. Bravo.",8,1,1,8 June 2008
Quantum of Solace," We've been expecting you Mr Bland.
","Casino Royal was always going to be a hard act to follow, and with a film based upon a short story than nobody had really read, we were all worried about the fate of Quantum of Solace. The end result, while disappointing, doesn't skip on the gritty, nasty full blooded action, paced beautifully. What Quantum fails to do is improve on its predecessor while its without a doubt more action packed none of the action in here rivals that that was in Casino Royal. Its plot is sparse and ankle deep and it doesn't even manage to make bond girl, Olga Kurylenko interesting. Shortlising as one of the worst bond girls ever.Whats amiss here is a competent director, while decent in his own right what with classics such as 'Monsters Ball' and 'Stranger than Fiction' under his belt. What he lacks is the ability to competently merge action with drama which I'm sure has many people worried for 2010's 'World War Z'. What this films gets right, it gets right well. Daniel Craig has never been better, the set pieces are fantastic and the musical score runs smoothly. Ands what's always reassuring with this series is than if you didn't like how the direction was handled in this outing there always hope for the next in the franchise.A devastating betrayal sends James Bond from Australia to Italy and South America on a mission of vengeance that pits the suave super-spy against a powerful businessman with diabolical intentions. Betrayed by Vesper, 007 (Daniel Craig) suppresses the urge to make his latest mission personal as he teams with M (Judi Dench) to interrogate Mr. White (Jesper Christensen). It soon becomes apparent that the organization behind the blackmailing of Vesper is more powerful than Bond and M had previously anticipated, and after discovering forensic evidence that links an MI6 traitor to a bank in Haiti, Bond immediately sets out to gather more intelligence.Another missing element that simply can't help but be compared to Casino Royal is this films bad guy, not only is he not threatening, sinister or a danger to bond at any point but Jesper Christensen fails to worry us at any point. He's disposable and in not league with last year's Le Chifre. And in that lies one of the film's most entertaining fortes. This is unlike Any of the previous bond flicks for one reason, it's the first true sequel. Anybody who hasn't seen Casino Royal will not be able to follow the structured story. And those that have will be grateful for the continuation. This feature and Craig himself manage to keep Quantum of Solace afloat but its dull action and poorly scripted characters that almost has it sinking.Verdict: A decent if forgettable entry to the 007 franchise that fades from memory the second you've left the theatre but will keep you engaged long enough that it doesn't become tedious. Craig shines while other like Kurylenko and Christensen manage a passable but far from good performance. It won't make anybody top 10 Bond films but it is far from the worst. Were shaken and stirred, for now.",6,3,5,1 December 2008
The Butterfly Effect," If only I could change my past, I would have avoided this.
","How is it possible that a film of such disastrous proportion could make both critics and movie goers proclaim it a modern masterpiece? Me? I'd rather watch paint dry. I've never been a big Aston Kutcher fan, well when I say that I do in fact mean I am an avid hater of his so called acting. Charisma, talent and likability. Those are the three vital qualities he lacks as a human being. Let alone an actor. Amy Smart does a commendable job while Melora Walters sinks into the back ground.Attempting to make a good film out of a novel premise only manages a few unintentional smirks. Ditching the far superior Donnie Darko routine and playing it unbearably camp. There's absolutely no way you could take this film seriously therefore much like the film, its premise rolls to the back of your mind. I was really interested in seeing this movie. Not because of the actors, but because of the intriguing message behind the story. Shame then that not only did it not live up to my expectation but it managed to be worse than I thought it could be.Final Destination 2 screenwriters Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber make their directorial debut with the sci-fi thriller The Butterfly Effect. Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher with facial hair) wants to free himself from his disturbing childhood memories.As a kid, he often blacked out for long periods of time and tried to detail his life in a journal. As a young adult, he revisits the journal entries to figure out the truth about his troubled childhood friends Kayleigh (Amy Smart), Lenny (Elden Henson), and Tommy (William Lee Scott). When he discovers he can travel back in time in order to set things right, he tries to save his beloved friends.However, he finds out that relatively minor changes can make major problems for the future. The Butterfly Effect also stars Eric Stoltz, Ethan Suplee, and Melora Walters. The title was inspired by the story A Sound of Thunder by Ray Bradbury.Naturally it plays like Final Destination on speed, rushing from one bad plot twist to the next. It never takes time to explore its emotions and in all feels not only generic and predictable but also extremely badly paced and therefore un-enjoyable.Of course, Kutcher's wooden, wide-eyed, sub-Keanu attempts at 'serious' only encourage the splutters, and while criticising him for this is like slapping a baby for crapping in its nappy, it has to be done. He truly is a credibility vacuum, and even if writer/directors Bress and Gruber (Final Destination 2's scribes) had scrawled a quarter-decent script, he'd still have scuppered it. But they haven't, so the blame can be spread.My Final Verdict? A Donnie Darko rip-off bewildered by its own metaphysical corkscrewing. And one of the most unwittingly funny movies of the year. Avoid at all cost unless you like car crash cinema at its very worst. If Kutcher's performance doesn't put you off the unbearably bad plotting and poor pacing making this the worst film of the year.",2,1,3,8 June 2008
Revolutionary Road," Revolutionary Road: It's a one way street
","Stop, before you even attempt to read this review I must warn you. If you are currently engaged, if you are in a happy relationship and especially if your newlyweds, stop reading now. This movie is designed to repel you. This may just be the most depressing movie of 2009. An anti-marriage campaign if I ever saw one. What sets it apart from other movie with the same attitude (The Heart of Me) is that its flawlessly done. Sam Mendes movie looks and sounds gorgeous and not once does it put a foot out of line. What Revolutionary road fails to do however is maker you like it. Its wonderfully made sure, but the subject material is so banal its almost impossible to sit through.With 'American Beauty', Sam Mendes's previous film, we were given at the very least a glimmer of hope. The theory behind that movie was that even in the last year of your life you can live a lifetime over. Here, none of these characters are given a glimmer of hope; in the end it all feels worthless.It's a movie for a specific audience, an audience I thought I catered to, with this movie however I even had to think twice about staying. It's not that it's a bad movie however, as I said it's wonderfully made. Look as hard as you want your won't find a flaw, its simply a case of the execution overruling the premise, a rare feat but true in this case. Its seems that from the get go this story fails to do justice to the elements Sam Mendes incorporates into it.These elements, done so flawlessly, include two riveting performances from Kate Winslet and Leonard DiCaprio both playing tortured middle class people living in 1950's America. Titanic shipmates Kathy Bates, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Kate Winslet step onboard for director Sam Mendes' tale of suburban malaise in 1950s-era Connecticut. Adapted from the classic 1961 novel by author Richard Yates, Revolutionary Road tells the tale of a young Connecticut couple whose once-idealistic relationship steadily deteriorates into a ceaseless cycle of petty jealousy and bickering as they strive to retain their independence in the conformity-obsessed world of picket fences and perfectly manicured lawns. Ever since they first met, Frank (DiCaprio) and April (Winslet) saw themselves as special and different.They strive to form their relationship around higher ideals, though upon moving into their new home on Revolutionary Road, the defiant couple pledges never to be confined by the social conventions of the era. As time passes, however, Frank and April gradually become the very thing that they both feared most -- a typical suburban family complete with abandoned dreams and faded hopes. Frank loses his nerve after taking a comfortable job with a reliable salary, and April morphs into an unsatisfied homemaker desperate for passion and excitement. But April's independent spirit hasn't been suffocated just yet, and when she hatches a plan to head for Paris, her need to escape at all costs stands in direct contrast to Frank's desire to hold on to what they already have.The score is executed with the same pin price precisions of that used in American Beauty, it feels as if somebody has spent a great deal of time on it. As does this film itself, Sam Mendes may have been so busy with the elements of his movie he may not have realised that the premise he was making his movie on felt a little lifeless. For better use of the word, a downer. Revolutionary Road is beautifully made, but it won't make your day.Verdict: A film crafter so beautifully it would be a shame to pass it up now. Sam Mendes directional style shine through the dim premise and while it's unlikely to leave any audience member happy, simply due to its depressing nature, it may just enlighten some. You come out knowing you have seen some great performances, brilliant direction and beautiful cinematography, but it is just not a film you love. For my overall rating I give Revolutionary Road 3/5.",7,0,1,31 January 2009
I Am Legend," Smith may be legendary, the film is not.
","Don't get me wrong, I am Legend is by no means a horrible film. Just tired and predictable. Where it should be delivering solid scares it delivers tacky horror in the form of a hoard of poorly designed CGI zombies. Smith carries the entire film on his shoulders (what do you expect?) and does a great job of it too. Shame the logic and subtlety is leaked after the first 40 minutes. Within that 40 minutes however your get quality Smith time, his charm and charisma (and his dog Sam) manage to hold the film up nicely for this 40 minutes and with some decent scares being provided everything is going OK. Until the Dark Seekers are reviled Did nobody see 'Alien'? That was a scary movie. Do you want to know why it was a scary movie? Subtlety! Direct Ridley Scott kept his horrific monster hidden for most of the film stalking and hiding in the shadows. You would only every get a glimpse of the Alien but that's what made the whole thing so scary, suspense and subtlety. With I am Legend however such things don't exist.Based on the bestselling novel by Richard Matheson the story follows Dr Robert Neville the sole survivor of a epic disaster that has claimed millions of lives. Fortunately our hero is immune to this infection and, along with his pet Alsatian Sam, fights his way through countless number of Dark Seekers (Zombies) to find a cure for this disease. Things turn from bad to worse when he realizes one of his test subjects is the Alpha Female and naturally this makes our Alpha Male a bit angry. angry. Hordes of shoddy CGI zombies running towards our last man on earth and you wonder why the director was so keen to show us these beasties when the creatures looks that dumb, even with the help of Computer Graphics.If it wasn't for the ever likable Smith and the 40 minute build up this movie wouldn't have a leg to stand on, the unfortunately underwhelming ending doesn't help either. Still it has more flavor than 28 Weeks Later and more smarts Than Resident Evil: Extinction. And well let's not even mention Black Sheep. I can proudly pronounce I am Legend the best zombie flick of 2007. A position which was not hard fought but even still.Now a word on Dash Mihok's Alpha Male if you don't mind. Whilst scary upon first encounter he reviles himself to be no more that a cheap Mummy (1998) rip-off.Also prepare yourself for one of the most abrupt and unsatisfying ending of this century at what appears to be the climax of the film the action slows and the end credits roll. Without warning the film abruptly stops. If you don't mind being disappointed this film is for you.My final Verdict. Far more flavored than 28 Weeks Later, far smarter than Resident Evil: Extinction. While I am Legend may not have the subtly to classify it as a horror film it will do just fine as a mindless block buster. Legendary? Not quite!",4,1,2,26 April 2008
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Its a curiouse thing...
","As far as directors go, David Fincher ranks among thoses I idolise. His gentle interplay with dark and light, fun and sorrow and most importantly the real and the surreal. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button isn't his greatest movie, his most lavish movie, but not his greatest. What's striking is the way Finchers worst still manages to be better than most director's best attempts. Despite some negative criticisms, Benjamin Button is a beautiful movie, both tender and tremendous. If not overly emotional. It manages to sustain both style and substance where something like 'Australia' dropped the ball. Finchers movie is well worth the wait and a certainty at this year's Oscars.One thing that resonates wonderfully is the chemistry between Brad Pitt and Kate Blanchett, reunited after starring together in the 2007 movie 'Babel', there characters show development and while there not all going in the same direction you can feel them growing, learning with age, or youth in this case. It takes a world-class storyteller and a great yarn to rivet your attention for nearly three hours. This very classy, old-school movie -- employing cutting-edge technology that will make your eyes pop -- did it for me.David Fincher's The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, an adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's story, re-teams the director with Brad Pitt, who takes on the title role. What makes Button such a curious case is that when he is born in New Orleans just after World War I, he is already in his eighties, and proceeds to live his life aging in reverse. Brad Pitt gives a bravura, Oscar-caliber turn in Fincher's modernist epic yet lyrical tale, which bears resemblance in structure and magical realism to Forrest Gump (both penned by Eric Roth), but without that film's simplistic morality and sentimentality This sweeping film follows the character's unusual life into the 21st century as he experiences joy and sadness, loves lost and found, and the meaning of timelessness. Cate Blanchett co-stars along with Tilda Swinton, Elias Koteas, and Julia Ormond. If there's one thing this films is going to be remembered by its the beautifully subtle yet equally frightening make up effect sued on both Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. The creators blended both visual effect with make-up effect to create some of the most awe inspiring visual effect to dat. You believe in these characters because the actors playing them are shown at every stage of their life. Aptly for a film so concerned with time, Button is 13 minutes shy of three hours and just flies by. If this is Fincher selling out, can he sell out more often please? An epic, melancholic romance that employs a multi-generational cast and groundbreaking visual effects. It's a testament to Fincher's skill as a storyteller that the film actually works, albeit sporadically. There may not be the normal, anticipated dosage of sentiment to latch onto in this film, but in exchange for patience and a little faith, Button presents the exquisite weight of the human experience in a manner the screen rarely witnesses.Verdict: Touching yet never tedious, sensitive yet never overly sentimental. Button balances all of its elements perfectly and while the running time may scare some, the movie flew by in manner of seconds merely due to the charm and charisma of its leads. Tantalizing, touching and timeless - an epic fable revolving around mortality. For my overall rating I give The Curious Case of Benjamin Button 4/5.",8,2,4,9 February 2009
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," It brightened up my day.
","Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is a vague title. So much so that its almost off-putting. My first though after seeing the trailer was that this film is strictly for the youngsters; something you might leave them at while the parents go see something considerably more adult. Truthfully, this couldn't be any further from the truth. Cloudy with a chance of Meatballs is no only one of the most entertaining animated movies thus far but it's one of the best movies I've seen all year. Now i know what you're thinking. This guy has lost all credibility, there's no way this could be on par with Pixar's outing. You know what; if I were you I wouldn't believe me either. Honestly though. The film has masterfully written material and production values to die for. Each scene is crafted with care and a keen eye for the obscure.Inspired by Ron and Judi Barrett's beloved children's book of the same name, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs follows inventor Flint Lockwood (voice of Bill Hader) and a brainy weathergirl Sam Sparks (voice of Anna Faris) as they attempt to discover why the rain in their small town has stopped, and food is falling in its place. Meanwhile, lifelong bully Brent (voice of Adam Samberg) relishes in tormenting Flint like he did when they were kids, and Mayor Shelbourne (voice of Bruce Campbell) schemes to use Flint's latest invention -- a device designed to improve everyone's lives -- for his own personal gain. Mr. T. voices by-the-books cop Earl Devereaux, and James Caan voices Flint's technophobe father Tim.Cloudy managed to get its fundamentals out of the way rather quickly. While most animated features these day will rely on the cliché, Cloudy braches out in to the vague and at times downright obscure. Don't get me wrong there is a lot for children to enjoy here. The artistry is astounding and the sight gags are constantly amusing but the real hilarity comes from the jokes aimed at adults. Its perplexing but magnificent when 9/10 of every joke told hits dead on. This is an outright guarantee, you'll be laughing throughout 50% of the film. The other 50% you'll be spent in outright awe of the visuals which are unmatched by today's standards. Much like the graphic kids books its based off 'Cloudy' certainly has its own art style, whether or not you like it is all down to taste.'Cloudy' looks phenomenal. Every inch of the film is innovative, and jaw dropping. Though not for everybody. The animation style is extremely over the top and eccentric. If your sensitive to flashing colour, or you though 'Speed Racer' was an ugly film your likely to have a similar problem here. No matter your taster there no denying the outright beauty of the final act which sees several unbelievable set pieces made cleverly out of food. It's this innovation that makes me so positive towards this, one of the best films of the year.Verdict: Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is one of the funniest films of the year - a hugely enjoyable, superbly written and brilliantly animated comedy that'll send you out of the cinema grinning from ear to ear. Unmissable entertainment. Modestly, Meatballs opens with the dedication: 'A film by . . . a lot of people.' Well done, a lot of people. You've made a lot of other people very happy. And hungry. 5/5.",10,5,11,26 September 2009
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," This certainly isn't a bedtime story.
","If I were to have a problem with this otherwise stunning film it's the fact that, much like 'The Dark Knight' this is not a film you want to take your kids to. Its dark, disturbing and one of the best weepers of this fine year. Anybody above the ages of fifteen, you must see this movie. It might not beat 'The Dark Knight' with style or substance but this is without a doubt the most important film of the year. The imagery is so disturbing, you have to remind yourself, it's just a movie. But here's where there no escape, this isn't Last House on the Left. This is real, this is a film based on a novel of the same named based on historical events of a German family moving to a country house near a concentration camp and their son befriending one of the boys inside the camps. And if your hearts not in your heart during that unbearably tense final act then something is painfully wrong with you. These final minutes are so disturbing i broke out inot a cold sweat, Even stranger is how I allowed this to slip under my radar for weeks. I remember reading the book that this is based on when I was young. I remember loving it. And now I find it just wonderful how much the makers of this film have done it justice. During World War II, 8-year-old Bruno (Asa Butterfield) and his family leave Berlin to take up residence near the concentration camp where his father (David Thewlis) has just been made commandant. Bruno is unhappy and lonely, until one day, when he wanders out behind his house and finds Shmuel (Jack Scanlon), a Jewish boy his own age. Though the barbed-wire fence of the camp separates the boys, they enter into a forbidden friendship, oblivious to the true nature of their surroundings.If i were to complain about this film, plausibility is where I would start. Its exaggerated for sure. The lack of authentic German accents, the seemingly absent guards and an overall sense that this wouldn't have gone in that direction. All however is quite easily redeemed with its tear jerker, heart stopping ending.As difficult as it may be to watch, it should certainly be a film that everybody sees if only for the realisation that this horrific event occurred. If you're willing to forgive some implacability faults and a couple of odd accents then you'll walk out of this film feeling stunned with just how horrific the truth is.Verdict: a painful yet fully accomplished journey, that will appeal solely to those who can withstand the disturbing imagery, erry settings and that holy mary mother of god ending that will have you clenching your jaw in hope they make a copout ending. To our dissatisfaction, they don't. And while it might have been more releasing it would have spoilt the realisation. For what its worth this is film of the year material.",8,2,4,11 October 2008
The Dark Knight," This Batman definitely isn't joking.
","Gotham city is alive, it's a living, breathing utopia that build on such a massive scale it almost outdoes Heaths chilling interpretation of The Joker. Boy is this one haunting experience, not only is Heath unnaturally humours but at the same time he manages to chill you down to the bone and despite is 12 certificate I do not recommend this to anybody below the age of 15 simply due to the sheer nature of Heaths character. Not only is it the performance of his life but what a stunning final bow if you will to his career. 10 years on when people are asking about him, the Dark Knight will be the film they turn to.And while he might outshine the rest of this films outstanding cast he doesn't complete the film. Just like last time Bale seems suited to the role, as if he was born to play Bat Man. Maggie Gyllenhal, the superbly sexy and sophisticated Rachel doesn't pull any of that damsel in distress clique and last but by no means least the stunning transformation of Aaron Eckhart from Harvey Dent into the sadistic and saddening two face is Chilling to say the very least. But this is by no means a mere character film. The action seems unbeatably. When Batman soars from building to building so do the audience. When the Joker laughs his high pitch screech the audience cowers as if he were real. Are you scared yet?Horrific as it may be, The Dark Knight is by no means rough around the edges competently soaring from Amazing set piece to the other and at an impressive 152 minutes it's a mystery on how director Christopher Nolan managed to keep the pacing in such perfect condition. Could it be that in fact we are all so captivated by the macabre brought by Ledger. The strangeness amounting from his recent passing away. Or is it the action keeping us glued to the screen unable to blink for a mere second just in case you miss one of the plenty moments that quite literally take your breath away. The truth is that its all of these, glued together and pumped with steroids. If you only go see one film this year make sure it's this one. I wouldn't be half surprised if this were to win best picture at the academy. Boy I sure hope it does. In truth we all wish for our own personal Batman. If only to add a bit of mystery back into our society. If I were to fault it in any way I would start with its inability to juggle its mass amount of characters, In retrospect you could merely see this as a justified excuse for a repeated viewing. With a tension building, spine tingling score it seems The Dark Knight is near perfect.VERDICT: As near perfect as were ever going to get. Not only is The Dark Knight the greatest film of 2008 but it's also this decade's finest film. With its haunting performances and it's out of this world action this flies straight to the top of The Words film of the year list and nestles deep within our sole as the most powerful and disturbing superhero movie to date. The posters might say 12A but I wouldn't trust them. but be warned. The joker could stay in your nightmares for years.",10,3,8,26 July 2008
Avatar," It's out of this world!
","James Cameron's sci-fi epic finally arrives having gestated in the filmmakers mind for longer than a decade. Is his vision of the future just as fresh in 2009 or is should this avatar be terminated? There's one thing you have to give Cameron, he is like the postman...he delivers; granted sometimes he may be a little late but if there 's one filmmaker you can always rely on its Cameron. I haven't disliked a Cameron movie to date, in fact I've loved, almost, everything he's done; with the exception of course being Piranha II but let's not get into that. Avatar is a razor-sharp reminder of how epic film-making is done. Not since Return of The King has epic been done on a scale this big.A paraplegic ex-marine finds a new life on the distant planet of Pandora, only to find himself battling humankind alongside the planet's indigenous Na'vi race in this ambitious digital 3-D sci-fi epic from Academy Award-winning Titanic director James Cameron. The story ticks all the right boxes, at least for a Cameron film. It's got good guys with guns, bad guys with even bigger guns and appalling guys with even bigger guns. It's far from original and won't come up at this week's book club. This said it's very engaging and the people, and aliens, involved are interesting. The film goes to great length in order to develop its characters so we feel the hardship and pain when they fall in battle. The film does an excellent job of keeping a good pace. Its near impossible to get bored whilst watching the film and this may have been the quietest i have ever seen an audience. It's an engaging trek through uncharted lands that, while feeling very familiar, is a brand new assault on the senses.James Cameron has spent a long time in incubation, flitting around on submarines, but if 'Avatar is a reminder of anything it's a reminder that he's the best the industries got. His harsh, no-nonsense approach to film-making has landed him with one of the most polished pieces of art of the century and for that I take my hat off to you. This may be the most polished movie of the decade, sweeping, epic and ... dare I say flawless? Not quite. As far as the direction goes however, it's close enough and ranks, for me, as Cameron's second best film to date, behind 'Aliens'. IN the hands of any other director this could have gone terribly wrong; anybody other than Cameron may have played it safe delivering a spectacle, but an underwhelming one. Cameron pushes so many boundaries with one single film that it's hard not to stand up and cheer once the final credits roll. This film has pushed the limitation of the cinema medium and emerged as one of the finest film of the decade. And dare I say a classic? The acting is exceptional. Nothing warms my heart more than seeing Weaver and Cameron united for the first time since she stood toe to toe with the alien queen. She is astounding and gives an electrifying performance as Dr. Grace Augustine a woman split between two worlds. What's funny is the fact that she is not the strongest actor in the film. If anybody deserves a standing ovation is has to be Zoe Saldana who completely transforms into this other worldly thing. If you had gone into the movie not knowing that that was her you would never had guessed she was even human. She is unrecognisable and exhilarating as Neytiri who is, without a doubt, the standout role of the film. Other congratulations must be given to Sam Worthington who shows us that Terminator Salvation was not just beginners luck. Michelle Rodriguez gives a stellar turn as Trudy Chacon and ends up the way Rodriguez usually ends up. That however would be too much information.Now for the pièce de résistance the reason you've already booked your ticket, the reason you're so sceptical, the reason the hype for this film is so large. The presentation. To call it out of this world would be an understatement. It's stunning. Sun all those pre conceived judgement and see for yourself. The sheer scope of the film is impeccable. This film will have you clambering through the jungle on horseback, soaring on the back of a banshee and just when you've taken in the sights and sounds Pandora has to offer you've bee blinded be the beautiful destruction on the final act. Any filmmaker that can make such destruction rather beautiful is a mastermind in my opinion.Verdict: Avatar is far more than a movie, it's a cinematic experience. This is a visually assault on the senses and something that is destined to change cinema forever. It's utterly gorgeous; all backed up with scene stealing acting, fantastic direction and, wait for it, the mother of all battle scenes. Believe the hype; Cameron has delivered one of the best films of the decade and something that will undoubtedly stand the test of time. I'll be waiting in anticipation for the sequel; just don't be too long will you?",10,38,61,18 December 2009
Drag Me to Hell," Drag Me To Hell
","So many questions, so little time. I'm just going to come out and say it not only will this review be one of the longest I've written but folks I'm not holding back, this may include one or two spoilers. The movie I'm talking about, of course, is Sam Raimi's 'Drag Me To Hell' which in theory is Sam Raimi's first horror films since The Evil Dead III: Army of Darkness. The main question, im sure, is does this director still have what it takes? Will he have me rolling in my seat nostalgic and immersed in the world he created with 'The Evil Dead' or like some naysayers have been stipulating, has he been in Hollywood so long that he won't have the chops for this. I think its safe to say at this point that he still has it, in fact it's so apparent that I felt inclined to stand up at the end of the movie and shout 'yes!'. Fortunately I was in a theatre with several other Sam Raimi fans and I wasn't the only one. In that the rue brilliance of this movie emerges, if you go see this by yourself, you'll have a great time, it will be a fun, forgettable romp. See it with friends, at night, in a crowded cinema and you'll be on the floor, 'please stop it your killing me' laughing.For anybody that doesn't know, and the trailer can be deceiving, this is essentially a comedy. Granted there are several sense where the film ups the ante and you are genially terrified (for example towards the end of the movie there is a séance sequence that drove me insane, pulling my hair out) but for the most part this is a comedy, and boy if it doesn't work, almost perfectly, there are sequences that are do ultra violent and over the top that you'll be begging for an intermission just to change your pants. The movie is cast phenomenally, the supporting cast plays in well, and don't play dumb when it comes to the point where they know this isn't their movie. There no denying that the film belongs solely to Alison Lohman who is such a juxtaposition when in context. Being the young, pretty pixie of a girl it's devilishly cruel what Raimi puts her through but, god damn it it's just so much fun to watch from beginning to end. In that we get this films true motivation. It's a playground for Sam Raimi, whatever you may think of the movie one thing is absolutely undeniable, Sam Raimi had a blast making this movie twirling his Dick Dastardly moustache saying 'what horrible stuff can I do to this girl next' If there's anything I can say that's bad about the movie and I almost don't want to after falling this deeply in love with it. (Spoiler Ahead) Raimi trys to pull a twist ending resulting in the immediate realisation of the audience, it almost plays as a merit if only because it will have you screaming in agony at the screen telling her, 'don't you even dare go in there' As much as I may think the twist ending is a stooper, all is made up when the films takes you beyond the level you expected to...welcome to hell. Scant of plot and barren of subtext, the film is single-mindedly devoted to pushing the audience's buttons, and my god if my buttons weren't pushed. Only one other movie this year had me feeling like I was pumped full of adrenaline and that was, funnily enough, Crank 2. This is that kind of insane, over the top, exploitative fun that I enjoy so very much.The 99-minute, eye-popping, bowel-twingeing, possessed-talking-goat extravaganza that follows must be one of the scariest things I've ever seen in the cinema. How bad? Well, I screamed out loud in genuine, save-me-now-Jesus terror for the first time since Evil Dead II. And I laughed through the fear much more often. Don't let the movies 15 rating deceive you, there may not be a whole load of blood on show (despite a horrific nose bleed sequence) but trust me you'll be throwing up your breakfast at the endless amounts of puss and slime and close up shots that may linger for days on end. You're unlikely to find a better night out this year and there not way this isn't going to make my 'best of' list.Verdict: It's a visceral assault on the senses and will have you gasping for breath as the laughs and scares mount. Raimi directs with the confidence and flair of a genre master. No Raimi fan would miss the opportunity at seeing the master filmmaker back at the helm of a movie that suits him so comfortably, this insane thrill ride grabs the audience full throttle and refuses to let go throwing blood, puss and slime in your face topping it off with a punch to the gut that is the nerve shredding ending. This is diabolically entertaining, ferociously funny and mind numbingly intense, go see it with friends, go see it at midnight. You have my guarantee you'll come back a new person, for better or worse. Muhahahaha!",10,4,8,28 May 2009
Grindhouse," Welcome to the Grindhouse
","This review will be separated into two halves. The first of witc h is a review of Robert Rodcrigueses Planet Terror.Planet Terror.Upon first inspection Planet Terror seems like one of those movies destined to join the pile marked 'so bad its good' but even with that looming over it Planet Terror doesn't lose its cool. It's a Grindhouse flick so it's generally in poor quality but as a film it's utterly fantastic. A tasteless orgy of guns, girls and gore. What more can you ask for? Married doctors William and Dakota Block - Josh Brolin (No Country for Old Men) and Marley Shelton ( Sin City) - find their graveyard shift inundated with townspeople ravaged by gangrenous sores and a suspiciously vacant look in their eyes. Among the wounded is Cherry Darling (Rose McGowan) a go-go dancer whose leg was ripped off during a roadside attack, and El Wray (Freddy Rodriguez), a mysterious drifter with a past. Cherry may be down on her luck but she hasn't danced her last number yet.As the virus turns the invalids into enraged aggressors, Cherry and El Wray lead a team of accidental warriors into the night hurtling towards a destiny that will leave millions infected, countless dead and luck few heading for the last safe corner of Planet Terror.Wacky as it may be, Planet Terror leaks with authenticity and humour. There no doubt its one of the most quotable films of the last year. And while Rodriquez is not quite as brilliant as Tarentino he does and admirable Job at making this film in his vision.Actors Rose McGowan, Marley Shelton and Josh Brolin are those who sine mostly and while Freddy Rodriguez is commonly referred to as the hero its McGowan who saves the day. Brolin is hilariously terrifying and Shelton clearly isn't afraid to get herself slapped around. The cast altogether look like their having a blast.So are undoubtedly the audience, this is the kind of film that the critics hate to admit they loved. Aside from me of course what with me looking forward to Grindhouse since the beginning of last year. Shame the n that us English audiences get both films split because it sunk at the American box office.Hopefully then the two masterful films will be reunited on their DVD release.Its soundtrack from director Robert Rodriquez who also happened to be the composer on Kill bill Volume 2 composes the main theme for this and to be perfect ally honest it's infectious. And while Planet Terror isn't quite up to the high standards of Quentin Tarentino Death Proof it still provides enough competition for Mr. Tarentino to get scared. Death Proof.It's a crying shame UK audiences didn't get the full Grindhouse experience. And all because of the Americans intolerance towards it. Fair enough if you're not into this kind of stuff it's hard to sit through a film devoted to talking and car crashes but look under the bonnet and you'll find a world of possibilities.The Characters of these 8 seemingly unlinked women brought together by one diabolical man played by the absolutely terrifying Kurt Russell. But even he can't provide as much character as these two groups of four women. The first the lesser interesting of them who are fortunately given less screen time than the other four. Though Sydney Tamiia Poitier provides much entertainment as a feisty girl looking for a good time. It's the second group is far more entertaining including an oddly good performance from Uma Thurman's stunt double of Kill Bill Zoe Bell cast ironically as playing herself in the movie. Rosario Dawson's subtle turn from concerned 'play it safe chick' to badass who in the end has the final laugh. As for Russell not much can be said about his massively entertaining performance only that he will most likely be haunting your dreams for long after what with him being absolutely bloody terrifying. As for plot there isn't much to it. A simple guy kill girl film reminiscent of the 70's Grindhouse flicks. But in no way does its film underestimate women what with Massive role reversal 17 minutes before the end in which there is one of the most dazzling car chases in history. In witch our heroines get their chance at revenge upon the psycho killer with deadly consequence. Director Quentin Tarentino doesn't skip on the foreplay with most of the film being clogged with female chit chat and one interestingly choreographed lap dance. Another thing director Tarentino didn't skip on it the authenticity. This could honestly be shown at a Grindhouse what with the humours title change at the beginning. The title 'Thunderbolt' flashes on screen only to be replaced by a grey added on reel correcting it. Or the jumpy tracking in with the voices sometimes doesn't go with the actors mouths. Truth be told this is a brilliant exploitation flick.Though one thing that dulls down 'Death Proofs' appeal is the horrible Tarentino cameo that is utterly cringe worthy. Not nearly half as cringe worthy as when he appeared in the second half of Grindhouse Robert Rodriguez 'Planet Terror' when he appeared as the comical 'Rapist 1' there is nothing comical about his acting abilities however. Or the fact that even when he transformed into that horrible beasty his performance was still vile.",10,0,1,12 July 2008
The Happening," The final breath of a filmmaker who was once quite brilliant.
","The year is 1999, a year of disappointments Anna and the King failed to do the original justice, the Blair Hype Project was well over-hyped and Sleepy Hollow seemed to be the start of the decline of Tim Burtons Career. So it's a wonderful feeling for a young critic to walk into a cinema and watch h a newcomer make a name for himself with the ultra scary The Sixth Sense. A year after that he gave us the rather brilliant Unbreakable followed by Signs witch was two thirds brilliant. The Village needed a little more work but even at that it was a decent piece of work. It seems his decline in greatness has been rather abrupt. 11 August 2006 the eagerly awaited new movie from master director holds our anticipation in a tight grasp only to disappoint. Little did we know that his follow up movie would be even more disastrous. A tale that follows the imminent destruction on mankind, a film so poorly made that at one point (look out for this) while Elliot is talking to Josh in the modal home you can see the microphone hovering above them. Such a sloppy effort from the so called master director. With on/off pacing, a trademark twist that's barely a twist and a plot that shames that of prom night. The Happening is a real disaster.So a good place to start for this review would be to find out just what the hell is happening right? Wrong! The plot is the main reason this film stumbles.What's happening? It's a good question, and one that's asked by at least 10 characters, ensuring viewers will remember the title however hard they try to forget the movie. Is it a terrorist attack? Signs 2, perhaps? No, waitÂ… Can it be linked to the missing bees that Mark Wahlberg's unlikely science teacher was banging on about in class? Or is it the most ridiculous scenario imaginable, a concept so daft an eight-year-old child would dismiss it before settling on 'And then he woke up and it was all a dream'? Unfortunately it's the latter, meaning belief is not so much suspended as rudely upended. And if that doesn't do it Â– trust us, it will Â– there's the risible dialogue ('Oh no' gasps a permanently bamboozled Wahlberg, Bill & Ted-style, when a companion blows their brains out), the wooden acting and the most inane set-piece you'll see this, or any other, year: our heroes attempting to outrun the wind. Shyamalan, then, has lost his way. The first misstep came in the last 10 minutes of the otherwise excellent Signs and the stumbles have become more and more pronounced. Yet he is a born filmmaker, capable of conjuring choking tension from a high-angled shot of a girl on a swing, a bank of rolling clouds.My Final Verdict? Avoid at all costs. The trailer might look tempting but truth is there isn't much happening in the happening. As much as i hate to admit it, this will be the directors last film. The last nail in the coffin if you will of his career. As for Wahlberg he could do a hell of a lot better. Not worth checking out in all. Sixth nonsense. A discomfiting experience.",1,14,29,14 June 2008
The Wrestler," It hits like a punch to the gut.
","Whatever you opinion on Darren Aronofsky previous film, The Fountain, that shouldn't affect you judgement on whether or not to see The Wrestler. Not only is Darren Aronofsky most mature, authentic and untimely heart crushing movie a film that will go down as one of Aronofsky best but it's the performance Mickey Rourke's been building his carer up for. There isn't a second that Rourke is caught off guard, his presence is undeniable his performance, Oscar worthy. There's this haunting quality for a film so authentic, which really adds to the overall feel you get from watching it.This is strong meat, and the exact opposite of a feel good chick flick. You end up with a visceral sense of a brutalised, brutalising celebrity culture, its attractions for adoring and adored alike. Most films take a benevolent view of the masses - hardly surprising, really, since they are trying to make money out of them.This movie isn't afraid to show the cruelty of the public, and that's virtually unique in a Hollywood film. I watch very few movies which couldn't have been improved upon, but this is one of them. I loved every mythic moment of it.His sense of identity fading into nothingness after the spotlights dim and he experiences a close brush with mortality, a retired wrestler begins to evaluate his life while considering the comeback that could very well kill him in director Darren Aronofsky's poignant portrait of an introspective former superstar in the twilight of his career. Back in his heyday, wrestler Randy 'The Ram' Robinson (Mickey Rourke) was an icon in the ring. His image immortalized in action figures and video games, he would headline arenas across the globe.Twenty years later, those glory days have passed, and Randy is forced to earn his keep by brawling before handfuls of fans in high-school gyms and community centres around New Jersey. In the wake of a heart attack, the former icon attempts to earn a little extra cash while working in a deli and making an effort to reconnect with his estranged teenage daughter, Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood). Yet, despite Randy's continued attempts at convincing local stripper Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) to settle down with him in his humble trailer, the ring still calls to him. Later, when the prospect of a high-profile rematch with his long-time nemesis presents itself, Randy is forced to weigh his mortality against his desire to hear the crowd roar one last time.Aronofsky has pulled off that rare feat - he's made a great film about a niche subject that will delight wrestling fans and cineastes alike. And Rourke's performance is a knockout. The characters may be stereotypes to us, but they're played here with a love and tenderness and resignation that could break your heart. Emotionally engaging, superbly directed drama, with a terrific script and a powerful, award-winning performance by Mickey Rourke.Verdict: This is a movie that improves on repeat viewing, having seen it twice already I can easily say it's one of my favourites of the Oscar season, the film resonates for hours after the final credits roll and even if you not enjoying the movie for the most part the end is guaranteed to floor you unlike ever before. For the most part 'The Wrestler' defines movie perfection. Brutal, brave and brilliant. This is an emotional roller-coaster that pulls out all the stops and sticks with you days after the films over. It's as simple as that. For my overall rating I give 'The Wrestler' 5/5.",10,1,2,31 January 2009
WALL·E," An Adventure Beyond the Ordinar-E
","Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Ratatouille. It would be a bit of an understatement to say that Pixar has had its fair share of successes both critically and commercially. So its comes as no surprise then that their latest WALLE manages to not only outdo all of Pixar's previous attempts but it also manages top spot on 2008 score board. So effortlessly brilliant that it manages to captivate its audience even when no words are being spoken. Both WALLE and EVE will, undoubtedly go down in history as two of the most charming and influential characters of all time.Sure there is a dip in quality when both robots leave earth to board the mother ship but even with this dip it still manages to soar avoid all previous attempts at creating what I perceive as the perfect animated film only really out shone by Princess Mononoke 11 years before. For this generation at least WALLE manages to be the greatest animated film, filled with warmth and wonder and so brilliantly original. Miss this and your missing 08's very best.Disney and Pixar join forces for this computer-animated tale about a wide-eyed robot who travels to the deepest reaches of outer space in search of a newfound friend. The year is 2700, and planet Earth has long been uninhabitable.For hundreds of years, WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) has been taking out the trash, and collecting precious knick-knacks in order to stave off the boredom of his dreary routine. Little does WALL-E realize that he has recently stumbled onto a secret that could save planet Earth, and once again make the ravaged planet safe for all humankind.When highly advanced search robot EVE makes friends with WALL-E and realizes the value of his remarkable discovery, she excitedly races back to let the humans know that there's hope for their home planet after all. But after centuries alone in space, WALL-E can't stand the thought of losing the only friend he's ever known, and eagerly follows her into the deepest reaches of space on the adventure of a lifetime. Along the way, the friendly trash-collecting robot who has always known what he was made for gradually begins to understand what he was meant for. Finding Nemo director Andrew Stanton returns to the helm for this family-friendly sci-fi adventure featuring the voices of Fred Willard, Jeff Garlin, and Ben Burtt.The main credit deserves to go to mastermind director Andrew Stanton who so confidently glides these characters round their fully believable world. What with this being his third feature film there's no doubt he knows his movies. The cramped sub-section is quite easily forgiven thanks to WALLE powerful presence. Trust me this is a stunning film.VERDICT: Pixar are no strangers to success. With each film being stunningly entertaining. WALLE is no exception. The film is soaked in character with both WALLE and EVE being flawlessly charming. 2008 best film by far bold, beautiful achievement.",10,6,10,20 July 2008
Iron Man," Stunning Craftsmanship if a little rusted inside
","There's no doubt Iron Man is an entertainment machine and a stunning one at that but it's a damn shame it takes so long and at so much expense to get there. Sure the pacing's not great and both the beginning and the end flitter with dodgy CGI and a underwhelming feel but there's no denying that the central parts of Iron man is the very best of marvel. It's lead man Robert Downey Jr. Who shines the most. He has just the right amount of dry Witt and charm to carry the film through even its patchiest moments.From Marvel Studios and Paramount Pictures comes Iron Man, an action-packed take on the tale of wealthy philanthropist Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), who develops an invulnerable robotic suit to fight the throes of evil. In addition to being filthy rich, billionaire industrialist Tony Stark is also a genius inventor. When Stark is kidnapped and forced to build a diabolical weapon, he instead uses his intelligence and ingenuity to construct an indestructible suit of armor and escape his captors. Once free, Stark discovers a deadly conspiracy that could destabilize the entire globe, and dons his powerful new suit on a mission to stop the villains and save the world. Gwyneth Paltrow co-stars as his secretary, Virginia 'Pepper' Potts, while Terrence Howard fills the role of Jim 'Rhodey' Rhodes, one of Stark's colleagues, whose military background leads him to help in Whose military background leads him to help in the formation of the suit. Jon Favreau directs, with Marvel movie veterans Avi Arad and Kevin Feige producing. Paltrow provides some much needed flavour to the otherwise dry script and Terrance Howard adds to the humanity that is often forgotten in super-hero movies. Fortunately while Iron Man does deliver on the humanity level when needed it doesn't allow humanity and realism to bring down the overall fun of the film as it is in Spider-Man 3.Iron Man isn't perfect, it's riddled with ultimately forgivable flaws but flaws none the less. Flaws witch most of the world seems to be able to over look considering its high rating and a place on IMDb's Top #250. For some though the flaws are too huge to simply ignore. Most eyes remain of Downey Jr. Throughout the whole show and quite rightly so. He is charming, sophisticated and best of all very funny. Its clear he was the right choice for this role. The CGI is a tad strange, flitting from computer graphics reminiscent of the original spider-man all the way to last year's transformers, there often bad there mostly good.Not too light, not too dark a bit grey, then? Not at all: this is buoyant, bright, a constant breeze. But still it hovers somewhere on the superhero-adapt spectrum between the good and the great. Not as flyweight as Fantastic Four or Daredevil or Ghost Rider, but just missing the myth-spinning splendor and heft of a Spidey 2 or X2 or Batman Begins.",6,5,11,25 May 2008
Blade Runner," My favorite movie of all time
","Blade Runner posed question most of us were afraid to answer. The most predominant of which was what will become of us if we allow the media to control us. The film represents 21st century life as a dystopian wasteland controlled by the censor, were our lives are pre-determined and were we can't turn a street corner without being confronted with a garish advertisement, none of which was a real problem back in 1982 when the movie was released. Which is why today's audiences have managed to connect so wonderfully with this movie. The neo-noir classic has a visual flair unmatched by any other film, not only in it genre, but quite possibly of all time. These days, it's almost impossible to find a gritty science fiction motion picture that doesn't owe at least a small debt to Blade Runner's visual style. And yet this manages effortlessly to balance both its substance and its style perfectly. Each character is fleshed out perfectly, each giving depth and insight to the grand scheme of it all.A blend of science fiction and noir detective fiction, Blade Runner (1982) was a box office and critical bust upon its initial exhibition, but its unique postmodern production design became hugely influential within the sci-fi genre, and the film gained a significant cult following that increased its stature. Harrison Ford stars as Rick Deckard, a retired cop in Los Angeles circa 2019. L.A. has become a pan-cultural dystopia of corporate advertising, pollution and flying automobiles, as well as replicants, human-like androids with short life spans built by the Tyrell Corporation for use in dangerous off-world colonization. Deckard's former job in the police department was as a talented blade runner, a euphemism for detectives that hunt down and assassinate rogue replicants. Called before his one-time superior (M. Emmett Walsh), Deckard is forced back into active duty.A quartet of replicants led by Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) has escaped and headed to Earth, killing several humans in the process. After meeting with the eccentric Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel), creator of the replicants, Deckard finds and eliminates Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), one of his targets. Attacked by another replicant, Leon (Brion James), Deckard is about to be killed when he's saved by Rachael (Sean Young), Tyrell's assistant and a replicant who's unaware of her true nature. In the meantime, Batty and his replicant pleasure model lover, Pris (Darryl Hannah) use a dying inventor, J.F. Sebastian (William Sanderson) to get close to Tyrell and murder him. Deckard tracks the pair to Sebastian's, where a bloody and violent final confrontation between Deckard and Batty takes place on a skyscraper rooftop high above the city. In 1992, Ridley Scott released a popular director's cut that removed Deckard's narration, added a dream sequence, and excised a happy ending imposed by the results of test screenings; these legendary behind-the-scenes battles were chronicled in a 1996 tome, Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner by Paul M. Sammon.Verdict: Blade Runner remains a dark masterpiece exploringandroid slavery and the decay of the human condition. Its visceral imagery of afuturistic and dystopian Los Angeles sticks with you for life. This raw, gorgeous,poetic masterpiece is one of the few films on my list that will have youreimagining the way you live your life. As time goes by, it's increasinglyapparent just how high this film towers.",10,0,2,20 February 2009
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," Sever meltdown
","To be perfectly honest, I wasn't a big fan of the first two Ice Age movies. The first one has a couple of solid jokes back-up with uninspired storytelling and cheap CGI. The seconds fixed any complaints I had with the animation but once again the laughs were futile and ineffective. Here we have Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs and with the prospect of 3-D to tantalise our taste buds it's hard not to get excited. But is this fossil becoming extinct? After the events of 'Ice Age: The Meltdown', life begins to change for Manny and his friends: Scrat is still on the hunt to hold onto his beloved acorn, while finding a possible romance in a female sabre-toothed squirrel named Scratte. Manny and Ellie, having since become an item, are expecting a baby, which leaves Manny anxious to ensure that everything is perfect for when his baby arrives. Diego is fed up with being treated like a house-cat and ponders the notion that he is becoming too laid-back. Sid begins to wish for a family of his own, and so steals some dinosaur eggs which leads to Sid ending up in a strange underground world where his herd must rescue him, while dodging dinosaurs and facing danger left and right, and meeting up with a one-eyed weasel known as Buck who hunts dinosaurs intently.Dawn of the Dinosaurs sports some great visuals, sweeping landscapes and phenomenal character design. Everything looks and sounds just as it should. The film spots some fantastic voice acting most prominently from Simon Pegg as Buck, what's trips them up is the lazy dialogue, as much as the trailer tried to deviate away from it, Buck is the focal point of the movie, he's in 80% of it and does a great job in every scene he is in. It's just a shame that by doing this they pushed the rest of the cast forcibly into the background. Dennis Leary who plays Diego has a prominently smaller role than in the previous film and acts as nothing more than a springboard for other characters. Here in lies the problem. The creators on Ice Age 3 have done a great job at capturing the look and feel of the era but have skipped over some serious character arch's, they resolve the main characters efforts but the supporting cast is criminally underused.The wrighting, unfortunately, is no sharper than that of the first two films. Which is to say it's rather blunt? Characters peak in monotonous one liners, there are fart gags left right and centre and while the audience who feel in love with this series back in 2002 have grown up, the series is still playing catch up. It's a futuristic looking film that feels like it was written way back in 2002. It feels uncomfortably convoluted at times with each character having their own primary motives and suffers from what a lot of threequel suffer from. T.M.S.G.O. Which stands for too much sh*t going on. It's confusing especially for younger audience members. The most disappointing aspect is the 3-D which at times is utterly phenomenal, but there such a rare occasion that if it weren't for the glasses perched on your face you would forget you were watching a 3-D film.Verdict: Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs looks years ahead of its time, it sports great visuals and an impressive vocal cast. The wrighting on the other hand are such in the Jurassic Era with a script stolen from'Animation for Dummies' it's a admirable attempt, but a one that feels older than the fossils it encompasses. Compared to animation giant 'Monsters Vs. Aliens' the 3-D is admirable but far from jaw-dropping. 2/5.",4,10,26,3 July 2009
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Welcome back Woody, weve missed you.
","If I were to tell you that Woody Allen, director of the exceptional Annie Hall, were back on top form you would most likely not believe me. Understandable of course considering he hasn't made a good movie for several years, funnily enough the truth is that he is indeed back on sparkling form with 'Vicky Christina Barcelona' his attempt at a romantic comedy showing off a beautifully ensemble cast including Javier Bardem, Scarlet Johansen and Penelope Cruz and while the premise may feels worn out and ultimately dull there this unusual chemistry between the three just mentioned that works as a huge advantage in favour of this movie. Even at the dullest point the movie remains a charm if simply for its colourful characterisation.One thing that stands out like a sore thumb is how wonderful Penelope Cruz is. Ultimately she's a brutally tormented characters unable to deal with her own ghosts and looks nothing but unstable for 90% of the movie. Honestly said, it's an Oscar calibre performance hitting all the right notes allowing her audience to see the pain she's experiencing.Woody Allen's romantic drama Vicky Cristina Barcelona stars Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson as best friends Vicky and Cristina. As the movie opens, the pair of twentysomethings travel to Barcelona so that Vicky can work on her post-graduate degree. The two meet the charming artist Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem), who offers to take them on a vacation and make love to them. Vicky, being a happily engaged young woman, refuses, but Cristina is eager for this life experience. A love triangle begins to coalesce, and things grow more complicated when Juan Antonio's passionate, unstable ex, Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz), arrives to stay after a suicide attempt.Ultimately, in exploring this distended romantic triangle, Allen never comes down on the side of either the dull stability of marriage or the unpredictability of the boho threesome, but his position remains clear. Vicky Cristina Barcelona is another in his persuasive arguments that love, for all the complexities and pain it throws up, is still worth chasing. And along with art, perhaps the only thing worth chasing. The performances of Bardem, Cruz, Johansson and Hall are delightfully inventive, with Cruz in particular relishing the tempestuous nature of Maria Elena and her tantrums.Vicky Christina may not be much in the long run but as it stand its a fun enjoyable fell-good romance movie with spectacular cinematography, sumptuous acting and a director that, for now, remains a one to watch. Allen has crafted a wry and thoughtful film about the peculiar stirrings of the heart, which is certainly his most accomplished piece of work since Match Point, and his funniest in the eight years since Small Time Crooks.Verdict: Believe the hype, Woody's back and better than ever with Vicky Christina Barcelona. While the territory is familiar, the terrain is new: Allen shoots his title city with an eye for its art and architecture and while undoubtedly forgettable, you'll have a blast watching it. Vicky Cristina Barcelona is so engaging so much of the time that it feels like a modest rejuvenation: evidence that a summer in Spain can do wonders for a writer-director who may not have outlived his prime. For my overall rating i give Vicky Christina Barcelona 4/5.",8,0,2,20 February 2009
Pineapple Express," James Franco and Seth Rogan get the munchies.
","This, quite fortunately, just happens to be one of the lesser funny Appatow comedies. No I say that as a compliments rather than a criticism because there is so much more to this movie than you would first expect. There's so much more going on than you would expect in this film, the characters more complex and likable. Now that's not to say you won't get some hard laughs from it. But, honestly, there far and few between. The action is what sets it apart. It's done better and with a hell of a lot more substance than 'Hot Fuzz' Though in all this is still an Appatow comedy so expect some pet hates to pop up. The crude nature, the hit and miss jokes and one of two out of place characters. None of which really makes an impact since the chemistry between Rogan and Franco is near perfect. They complement each other in the way that if one comedian is lagging the other will provide. And whilst director may overuse one them on several occasions usually it works a charm.Critically acclaimed director David Gordon Green takes a break from the brooding drama that defined such early efforts as George Washington and Undertow for this action-flavored buddy comedy concerning two pot-smoking friends (Seth Rogen and James Franco) who unwittingly become involved with a vicious gang of drug dealers.Judd Apatow and Shauna Robertson produce a script co-penned by star Rogen and Evan Goldberg. But as many critics have said, story is not Pineapple Expresses strongest point. It often zones out leaving gaps longing to be filled with absent humour. But when it gets into full swing it might just blow you mind. And while the humour seems somewhat sacrificed to make way for the (stunning) final action set piece it doesn't seem forced unlike 'Get Smart' witch merely when for effect over substance. Here you get plenty of both.Anybody who remembers Seth Rogan from 'Knocked Up' will know how good this guy is at making us laugh, and yet still keeping his likability and charm at the top of the scale and while that's all good and well it's France (who looked genuinely stone) who really blows your mind. If you though this guy was good Good as the Green Goblin you really haven't seen anything yet. Before this I considered him a better than average actor who isn't given enough screen time to an actor who rivals Shia LaBeouf in likability.VERDICT: It might not fall into anybody's top 100 comedies ever made but hell it falls into the top 10 Apatow comedy. It's great to see them get back on track what with the god-awful Step Brothers just beginning in to fade from memory. Here we have a hit and miss comedy, the hits come from the undoubtable chemistry, action and an end set piece that will blow your mind. The miss is in that I never laughed as much as I hoped. I was entertained and was smiling but the laughs are far and few between. These complaints won't stop the film inevitably entertaining you from start till end.",6,4,9,19 September 2008
Moon," My favorite film of the year.
","Anybody that knows me knows that I'm a sucker for a Sci-Fi story. Just two years ago I was bowled over by Danny Boyle's shimmering spectacle 'Sunshine' which provided human drama And Made for one intense thrill ride. Two years one and Duncan Jones releases 'Moon' a low budget, human drama that just happens to be set out in space starring Sam Rockwell, who happens to be one of my favourite actors working today. All of these ingredients should mix perfectly to create a film that's highly emotive, beautifully acted and a sight to behold but is this moon landing a giant leap, or just a small step.An astronaut miner extracting the precious moon gas that promises to reverse the Earth's energy crisis nears the end of his three-year contract, and makes an ominous discovery in this psychological sci-fi film starring Sam Rockwell and Kevin Spacey. For three long years, Sam Bell has dutifully harvested Helium 3 for Lunar, a company that claims it holds the key to solving humankind's energy crisis. As Sam's contract comes to an end, the lonely astronaut looks forward to returning to his wife and daughter down on Earth, where he will retire early and attempt to make up for lost time. His work on the Selene moon base has been enlightening -- the solitude helping him to reflect on the past and overcome some serious anger issues -- but the isolation is starting to make Sam uneasy. With only two weeks to go before he begins his journey back to Earth, Sam starts feeling strange: he's having inexplicable visions, and hearing impossible sounds. I could go into more depth about the plot of this film but, honestly the less about this film you know the better.Photobucket Firstly the film looks sublime. Much like Danny Boyles 'Sunshine' this low budget spectacle uses effects to enhance the story rather than distract from it. Mix that with some harrowing shots of the environment and you've got a film that both looks fantastic and, thanks to Clint Mansell's superb score, sounds great too. Sam Rockwell is a versatile actor, his range is absolutely phenomenal. One moment he is relaxed and friendly the next he's ready to slit your eye open with a pocket knife...but let's not spoilt that for you. Simply put. This is a Oscar calibre performance My only major grip with the film was with Kevin Spacey as GERTY who, does a good job, but often distracts you from the realism that the film strides for. All of these elements work just great, mixing together to display some fantastic presentation. It's the story and the direction that leads me to believe that this is the greatest film of 2009.The story is told at a steady pace. The film never ruses and the pacing feel organic, but its this slow pacing that made me feel distinctly uncomfortable while watching this film. The filmmakers never shy away from showing you a deserted hallway (cribbing heavily from 'Alien)and calling it disturbing is a severer understatement. So much so that once the film decided to give us answers you're so involved that seem personal to you. The film never shies away from pulling on your heartstrings either; a phone call to earth makes for one of the most emotional moments of the year. You might not think that 'Moon' is the greatest film of the year, the things I've described may not appeal to you. However, don't dismay this film. Even if it doesn't sound like it for you please go see it. If just to make your opinion on it.Verdict: Moon is a stunner on many levels. The direction is methodical and precise mixed seamlessly with the tour de force performance from Sam Rockwell. An eerie, disturbing and moving film, but not without occasional bursts of humour, Moon is a refreshing antidote to the dumb action-orientated futuristic fodder has dominated cinemas in recent years. For these reasons alone 'Moon' takes it's place as one of my favourite films of all time and my favourite film of 2009. 5/5",10,3,5,8 August 2009
The Proposal," The Proposal
","OK so, the rule is as followed. As a dude I'm entitled to enjoy one romantic comedy a year, any more than that and I may as well have grown a vagina. The trailer for 'Bride Wars' made me distinctively uncomfortable. I couldn't make it through the first 30 minutes of 'Confessions of a shopaholic' so it comes as no surprise that this proposal didn't interest me. Why did I go? To state a few reasons, its starring Ryan Reynolds, aka the greatest guy that ever lived. He was the one spot of blue in the big sea of red that was 'Wolverine' and his presence alone made me excited to see the proposal. The verdict? This is one of the better romantic comedies you'll be likely to see this year, granted its made especially for women, this won't send men into a nauseating coma but It may just make that special someone go week at the knees. If the movie doesn't do it, Reynolds is sure to.Sandra Bullock stars in the romantic comedy The Proposal, as a Canadian immigrant who creates a demanding and difficult work environment for her subordinates at the office. When the news arrives that she's about to be deported to the Great White North, she rushes into a marriage of convenience with her young assistant (played by Ryan Reynolds) to prevent such a catastrophe from occurring. 27 Dresses' Anne Fletcher directs from a script by Peter Chiarelli for Touchstone Pictures. The story isn't anything groundbreaking. To put it simply its tediously formulaic and, as is the trend for romantic comedies, 'The Proposal' doesn't aim for new heights. Instead of going for gold it plays it safe making for a satisfying if unoriginal coupling. The story hits every point you expect, it has the rise, the fall, the rise then once again, the fall and, not to ruin the ending but typically our heroes rise once more. It's been here seen that all before material but it does a decent job of getting from point A to point B.What works for the film particularly well is casting director Amanda Mackey Johnson knew what she was doing. The film is wonderfully cast with each actor giving it everything they could. We've come to expect exceptional performances from screen veterans like Reynolds, Bullock and Steenburgen but the real pleasure comes from Golden Girl Betty White was makes for a hysterical treat as she goes from the bizarre to the downright dangerous. Bullock is better here than she's been in some time. That's not to say she is going to be nominated for any awards but she gets the job done with grace and dexterity, and for a woman of her age to have the guts to do a nude scene, you have got to give her props. What's odd is my distain for this director (Anne Fletcher) previous two movies. Step Up and 27 Dresses were two films I couldn't get through, possibly because I'm the wrong crowd but here she brings her A game and directors each moment with grace and a certain style that I haven't seen in a Romantic comedy in quite some time. Whoever decided to cast Sandra and Ryan in this together is a genius. Their chemistry is so natural and they look so good together that it is one of the main reasons that this film works. You won't laugh out loud too often. And in fact some of the scenes are plain embarrassing (especially those involving Oscar Nunez's waiter/exotic dancer/minister character) but it is all rather engaging fun. Plus there is a very funny nude scene that Bullock and Reynolds have to share that goes to show that both are in good nick physically (remember she has 12 years on her younger co-star)and are game for a laugh. Verdict: The Proposal is not a marriage made in heaven by any means, but the eventual charm of the leads and a gag-packed second half manage to salvage the movie from inauspicious beginnings. Ultimately, there is something refreshing about The Proposal's undemanding humour and unabashed feel-good factor. A pedigree cast, fun premise and punchy dialogue make Bullock's return to romantic comedy look a great catch, and Reynolds is sharper than a diamond solitaire. For my overall rating I give the proposal 3/5.",7,0,3,27 July 2009
