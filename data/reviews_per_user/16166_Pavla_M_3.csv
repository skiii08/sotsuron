Lucky Number Slevin," Little bit too much
","We decided to see this movie mainly based on the fairly good reviews it got. First, we saw a trailer which wasn't very promising. But at the end the trailer was pretty much 'what you see is what you get'. They (the movie makers) were trying too hard, definitely. Characters aren't very layered and it seems to me that some of the cast (e.g. Freeman and Willis) did their part in a routine manner. The beginning is a little bit confusing but as you watch the movie, the pieces fall into place, but in a way that the viewer is able to guess how the movie is going to develop, and especially how it is going to end. It's a formula that has already been in some movies before (revenge of the child for the loss of his parents, etc). Also, I can't really have compassion for the main character in his pursuit to get revenge, because a lot of innocent people get killed on his way. The warmest part of the movie is a connection between Harnett an Lucy Liu, and I'm glad that she survived at the end. Overall, a very overdone, over-trying-to-be-cool movie with mainly predictable twists.",5,2,6,7 January 2009
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Forgetting this movie!
","I gave this movie a chance only because it had very good reviews. After seeing the trailer I thought - what an unfunny movie full of clichés. But I decided to give it a shot because trailers often don't portray the movie very well. What a waste of time... The movie is worst than the trailer and after spending 2 hours watching it, I couldn't recall one single line that made me laugh. The funniest parts of the movie were the CSI parodies, but that also is pretty passé. I couldn't relate to any of the characters nor hope that they will be together, because I found them utterly stupid. The plot is extremely predictable and inconclusive. Unintelligent comedy for people who are either still in high school or feel that way mentally.",1,61,114,9 January 2009
Cloverfield," Not CLEVERfield!
","It was probably the worst movie I saw. The camera-torture was something that I will not soon forget. Even if it was the greatest scenario, greatest cast and so on, the idea of a shaky camera throughout the whole movie was unforgivable. First of all it gave me a headache and made me very nervous. It is stupid to look for logic in this kind of movies but this is beyond any reasonable thinking. Just imagine that something so awful is happening to you and your friends and one of your friends through the whole terrifying situation, where you are literary fighting for your lives, is holding a camera in order to document it. There were a few scenes where they were in great danger and that stupid and annoying guy instead of putting the camera down and helping them, he keeps on filming! It is an insult for the viewers' intelligence. Further comments on this movie are not necessary. At the end it doesn't matter why, who and what had attacked the city because this ruined what possibly could have been an interesting movie. I can believe that film makers decided to go with this camera solution. Huge mistake.",1,1,4,10 January 2009
