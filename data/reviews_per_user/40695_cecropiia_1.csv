Requiem for a Dream," What can I say that hasn't already been said?
","This movie is amazing. It's raw; it takes your heart, tears it from your chest and twists it around before distorting you in every cognitive way possible. The music used to express everything was perfect; nothing was wrong, nothing was missing. It pieced itself together yet was somehow so disjointed and detached that I wanted to rewind things just to see them again, just to be enveloped by the brilliance used to portray the downward spiral of the character's lives. It was horrific because it was real, it was gripping, I wanted to vomit and scream and cry and I felt so empty and desperate for something that wasn't really ever there.",10,0,1,18 March 2005
