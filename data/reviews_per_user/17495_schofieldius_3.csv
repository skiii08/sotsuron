Hereditary," Pants
","I really don't mind if a movie goes over my head and I need to look up an explanation online after watching it, and I'm not the stupidest movie watcher. So I'm watching this, confused, suspending belief at the weird stuff thinking I will be able to look up a explanation. Like i had to with Primer. But that movie had big convoluted graphs that explained everything. So i didnt feel cheated. There really is no explanation that fits all the events in Hereditary. At all. So it must be a metaphor. And i hate movies that are metaphors because I'm rarely That well versed in religion or greek tragedies that I get them. If its a metaphor for grief, then its a very insensitive one. I'm giving this 4 stars because the set pieces and the lighting were decent.",4,0,5,30 August 2018

The Island," Gave me a migraine
","Michael Bay does not know the meaning of the word subtle. He wouldn't know subtlety if it floated down and gently booped him on the shoulder. Instead of watching this, watch the Michael Bay segment of Family Guy's season 10 episode Three Directors. The only reason I watched all of this movie was to see the tropes Family Guy predicted. Including the nausea and hradache inducing camera spinning and flashing lights abd oversaturatuon of everything. Like a David Guetta song on camera.",4,0,3,7 December 2018
