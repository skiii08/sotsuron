Casablanca," Great Classic Film
","Great film about a man who owns a coffee shop during 1941. Many twists and turns throughout the film along with intertwined stories and alliances which make for an exciting story to follow. The owner of the cafe has to try very hard to remain neutral throughout all of the encounters with different people that come into his restaurant Great camera work by director Michael Curtiz. Especially when dealing with moving camera angles. Very appropriate lighting, for example, in the scene at the end it is dark and gives you a mysterious feel to the whole ordeal that occurs between the men. Overall a great movie, easy to get into.",8,2,4,8 May 2012
Citizen Kane," One of the greatest films of all-time
","The film follows the life of Charles Foster Kane. Kane was a newspaper tycoon who slowly over to course of his life rose to be a very powerful man. The story started when he was a kid and followed him all the way to his downfall. The story is told primarily with flashbacks and memories of Kane. The director Orson Welles edited the movie flawlessly to gather suspense. HE also was very sound on techniques used in the film industry. For example, in one of the opening scenes he shows a light and as you get closer the light remains in the exact same area based on rule of thirds. His camera shots are very captivating and direct you exactly to the place he wants you to look. His outstanding film has made the word 'rosebud' a staple in American Cinema.",10,0,3,28 February 2012
The Graduate," Captivating and Funny
",Very funny movie dealing with intertwined relationships and romance. Camera work and lighting is virtually flawless and might be the best seen during this time period. Movie draws the viewer in by making him sympathetic for the main character as he deals with troubling situations involving a family friend. As he falls in love with the daughter of his affair things turn for the worst as she will not accept defeat. Some of the humor is very outrageous yet fits perfectly in the picture that the director painted for the viewer. The main character is a very animated person and does a very good job holding interest in the viewer and also developing a personality that people can relate to.,9,1,2,8 May 2012
