Saturday Night Fever," Not just Real Disco, Saturday Night Fever' is a Real Good Story'
","From the classic opening scene when a young paint store worker struts down the Brooklyn street with a bucket of latex, to the stirring BeeGees rendition of 'Staying Alive, you know that director John Badham's Saturday Night Fever' has attitude. And attitude would seem to be just what you'd need to succeed in a place like New York. It's the story of Tony Manero. An Oscar nominated performance by then teen idol John Travolta. Who was the star of the popular TV sitcom 'Welcome Back Kotter' Manero, although languishing in a minimum wage job during the day, takes over the dance floor at the local disco by night. He is the king and an icon to his loudmouthed and juvenile friends. Who all seem to be on a road to nowhere. As pointed out to him by his new love interest Stephanie ( Portrayed by Karen Lynn Gorney ) The problem with this love interest is that she's not all that interested in him, Unlike his drooling groupies at the 2001 Disco. (Which was actually filmed inside the famous studio 54 ) And this causes Manero to stop and think that his life may be headed down a dead end street as well. This picture is not just you're mindless dance romp. Travolta creates a character who is totally believable. He makes you think that Manero is as crude as his idiotic friends. But it's the great way Travolta emotes and you can see on his face what's going on in his character's mind. It's still his best performance to this date. There are plenty of moral implications and concerns. Manero's brother is/was a priest, who returns home to their Italian parents to break the news to them that he's lost the faith. One of Tony's friends has gotten his girlfriend pregnant and is pressured to marry her by both sets of parents as well as his local priest. You can see just that little trace of the 1950's morality still remaining in the disco era society. Today, almost thirty years later. A single mother does not wear the same scarlet letter as she did even then. And recent revelations of child molestation in the Catholic church would probably make a family weary of being related to a priest rather than proud of the fact. But it's fun seeing the disco era as it really was instead of some cheesy imitation. If I had one problem with the film it would be with Gorney. Stephanie tells Tony and his friends that she's 'Only twenty' Yet at the time of the filming Gorney was thirty one. And she really does seem and look too old for the roll. As my father so crudely pointed out. 'You can't make a woman's ass that's thirty one look twenty.' But she can do the scenes. At one point after her and Tony meets her old boyfriend, she is reduced to tears by his jealous barbs. Gorney does fine work in this scene and you can feel the strain. Maybe that's what they were thinking when they cast her. That and the fact that she has a great Brooklyn accent. While the film has a great story with a little bit of everything. The music really is special. The soundtrack, which was dominated by the BeeGees, is the very cornerstone of the disco craze. When Tony and Stephanie ultimately dance to their 'More Than a Woman' a truly great song. To Badham's half fast half slow motion direction. The results are pure bliss. Actually the whole film is charming and fascinating, and I believe extremely underestimated. 'Saturday Night Fever' is about life. About difficult choices and conflicting voices. About growing up and having the courage to chase what you want. And it sounds and looks beautiful. Whether you like dancing or not, this movie's for everyone 10 out of a possible 10 T.H.",10,1,2,3 July 2005
Scarface," Brutal Cuban refugee Tony Montana murders his way to the top of a drug empire in 1980s Miami
","Although some critics panned Pacino's performance as over the top, and his Cuban accent as bordering on the absurd, the film has amassed an ample cult following over the years since its release. And Pacino himself has said on many occasions that 'Scarface' is his favorite film in which he has appeared. Despite his detractors many also thought that Pacino shined as the ruthless Tony Montana. An anti Castro Cuban criminal freed from the bonds of communism by the dictator's decree which casts out undesirables. He then lands on the shores of Miami along with his womanizing yet equally as murdering sidekick Manny, respectfully portrayed by Steven Bauer. It doesn't take Tony long to launch his own lethal version of the American Dream. There are many horrific killings throughout the film as Montana carves out his own terrifying niche in Miami's drug trade. Taken in by a local drug lord/Mercedes Benz dealer ( Robert Loggia ) Montana soon finds that his ambition to 'Get what is coming to him.' Which he describes as 'The world and everything in it.' is not without some pretty stiff competition which he is more than up to the task of meeting head on. The main trinket Montana wishes to add to his growing collection is his boss's live in girlfriend played by then newcomer Michelle Pfiffer in an excellent performance as a woman just as addicted to being kept as she is to the cocaine that she continually sniffs. But we never lose sight of Pacino in an engrossing portrayal of a homicidal maniac let loose on a free society after being so long repressed by a regime as terrible as he. The most amazing part about Pacino's performance is how both he and the audience are totally absorbed into the character, at some point you tend to forget that Pacino is in there. Although Montana seems larger than life, you will believe that he has a life of his own. And he takes many lives in this film. To say the violence in many of the scenes is gratuitous is a gross understatement. Often forgotten is Montana's blunt yet clever sense of humor. Just when you feel you can't stomach the gore anymore Pacino will deliver a shining sliver of wit that brings a grin. Interestingly Pacino and co-star Loggia used to dine and hit many of the South Beach night spots while still in character of their Scarface rolls. Like him or lump him Tony Montana has became a part of American culture. I say deservedly so. This is an excellent film. 9 out of a possible 10 T.H.",9,0,1,15 June 2005
Dawn of the Dead," Satiric but not Satanic. Dawn of the Dead can't live up to the great original
","Screenwriter James Gunn tries to add some new twists to George A. Romero's creepy 1978 script. But it's a hard act to follow. Our story follows registered nurse Ana ( Sarah Polly ) Who takes to the hillswith the rest of the Milwaukee area after her husband is murdered along with half the town by packs of rampaging zombies. It isn't long before she crashes her car off the panicked highway and runs into still human police officer Ken, played by the always excellent Ving Rhames. Banding together while dodging and executing the zombies alike, they meet up with a few more straggling survivors led by Mikhi Pfifer who has a pregnant girlfriend in desperate tow. In dire need of a safe house, and learning that many potential havens have been overrun by the bloodthirsty dead. They finally have to settle for breaking in to a large shopping mall. The problem with this, compared to Romero's genius original idea is that all the surprise element is gone for fans of the 1978 film. And the shocking quaintness of the inhabitants taking advantage of the mall's finer points seems lost in the shuffle of some pointless twists. In other words, during Romero's story, you could feel enough horror as to where you could picture yourself locked inside the mall. And you could relate to the extreme relief the raiders would be feeling in that situation. I didn't feel the same sense of urgency and therefore terror here. We don't even see that much of the mall. Instead, we have a revolving door of new characters most soon to be zombie food. And none all that interesting. In the original the cast was narrowed. Making it much easier to cozy up to the characters. Here a hard rock soundtrack keeps kicking in, not much of a substitute for Romero's eerie elevator music. There are some pluses, both Phifer and Rhames give credible performances as men in an impossible situation. Seeing how naturally these fine African American actors blend seamlessly with the rest of the cast, is a credit to Romero's vision. When 'Night of the Living Dead' debuted in 1969, Romero was ostracized for going with a black or 'Negro' leading man. He was told at the time that it was an outrage which would not wash with white audiences. Well here we are thirty six years later, and because of pioneers like Romero, black actors get the opportunities they deserve, while we scarcely notice the difference. All in all, I'd say 'Dawn of the Dead is not a total loss, it just doesn't approach the queasy horror of the original. And even though these zombies run much faster. Were still not quite as frightened that they might catch up. actually, this film is much more like an American version of '28 Days later' the British zombie takeoff, than it is to respecting Romero's Satanic vision. Good entertainment, but not permanently scarring horror. 6 out of a possible 10 T.H.",6,1,2,25 June 2005
Spider-Man 2," More Human than Spider. Troubled Peter Parker languishes through Spider Man II
","In the second installment of the adaption of the Marvel comic book hero's saga. Peter Parker ( Tobey Maguire ) is exhausted and disillusioned at the prospect of continuing his double life as his alter ego Spider Man. Beset with financial troubles and lovesick for his childhood sweetheart Mary Jane Watson, Portrayed modestly by beauty Kirsten Dunst. Fearing he can never be with Mary Jane and protect her from Spider Man's mortal enemies at the same time, He sets out to try and erase Spider Man from his consciousness. But there are plenty of pitfalls along the way. And the more Parker tries to keep things calm, the more catastrophes flare up. Most of them just aching for the return of the wall crawler. And when yet another mad scientist is hideously altered by a benign experiment gone awry, there is never any real doubt that Spidey will return. Otto Octavious or Doc Ock, one of Spider Man's main nemesis in the best selling comic book, is portrayed with maniacal intellect by Alfred Molina. A fine actor who has had excellent rolls in lots of top notch films including 'Boogie Nights' and 'Magnolia' but will probably always be remembered as 'Moody' in the docudrama 'Not without my daughter.' If I did have a problem with this film it would be with Mcquire. If you're going to remain true to the gist of the comic book, which I think this movie otherwise does an excellent job of. You'd have to also remain true to the Peter Parker character. Peter Parker was not a nerd. He was a shy young man who blossomed through the lessons he learned as the incredibly powerful Spider Man. Mcquire looks to me like a real nerd, and therefore he has no room or way to blossom. I think they could have fit someone hunkier with a set of horn rimmed glasses at the beginning and convinced me that they had bulked up through web slinging and grown up through crime fighting while still looking like a movie star. In Mcquire's defense, playing a super hero can be difficult, because it is so outrageous to think that someone could ever posses superpowers, left alone make anyone believe a real human being would choose these reactions to the world in their situation. And he is credible inside this theory. I'm not saying Tobey Mcquire is an incompetent actor, I'm saying he is wrong for this roll. He is simply too milk toast for my tastes. Especially when he's attempting to court the beautiful Dunst. Who's elegance leaves no doubt as to why Spidey would prefer to be human. There are lots of pluses though. Molina is a strong and convincing villain. And the special effects are an absolute wonder. The entire effects crew received an Academy Award for their efforts and it's easy to see why. The deadly artificial limbs sported by Doc Ock, are as convincing as they are terrifying. Whether he's walking down the street, climbing a wall or battling the wall crawler toe to toe, it is a breathtaking spectacle. I have never seen a film, including the amazing 'Star Wars' sequels, which could boast effects as realistic and stunning as these. For fans of this genre there is no drop off from Spider Man to Spider Man II. It is much more like another issue than it is a sequel and this is a credit to the brain trust behind this engine whether or not they meant to present it this way. They tease you with the human struggle, then knock your noggin off with thrilling action. This is a blockbuster worth every penny. Don't miss it. 8 out of a possible 10 T.H.",8,1,2,22 June 2005
A Clockwork Orange," Philosophical 'Clockwork Orange' Thrills us with it's Lessons
","Anthony Burgess book of the same name is really the rarest of gems in English letters; The philosophical novel. The main character is the near futuristic street thug Alex, played in director Stanley Kubrick's ultra violent screen adaptation by Malcolm McDowell. Who brings a priceless and vicious vigor to the roll which is almost impossible to top. Alex and his gang of 'Droogs' wreak havoc on 21st century London, as they rape, rob and rampage throughout the early scenes of the film and novel alike. Both stories following each other very closely with just a few minor changes. But when Alex is betrayed by one of his traitorous droogs after giving him a thorough 'Tollchocking' He finds himself holding the bag for a burglary gone awry. Which turns into the bludgeoning death of an elderly cat lover. With a long and frightful arrest record Alex finally lands in prison. Where he sets out to convince the in house Chaplin and anyone else who'll listen that he is reformed and ready to rejoin society. And when a radical new treatment becomes available to one lucky inmate. A therapy which can be completed in a mere two weeks. Alex considers himself the perfect candidate to be revamped and released in a fortnight's time. Not realizing that he will become 'A Clockwork Orange.' When Kubrick previewed his film for critics and audiences alike. People were stunned by what they saw. And whether or not you liked it or hated it one thing was for sure. No one had ever seen anything like it. The 'Ultra violence' is amply gratuitous and the rape scenes are harrowing, especially for the era that only immediately followed the sexual revolution. It's hard to imagine that Kubrick got the code and ratings administration to slap an R rating on there. Actually the film was originally hung with an X rating and it only after Kubrick revamped the editing, which included speeding up some scenes which were downright pornographic that he was able to get the labeling changed to an R rating. The dialogue is similar to the dialect which Burgess employed in his brilliant novel. Which is Alex's own mix of Russian, street slang and the regular King's English. Hearing McDowell speak these lines with wit and vinegar is very satisfying. His performance is a special accomplishment. I'm sure he brought more terror and life to this persona than even Burgess, who was also an accomplished conductor and writer of classical music, dared dream. And Kubrick isn't too bad himself. No one had ever even attempted to make a film this daring up to that date. And whether you gather the moral implications or not. There's not one scene that wouldn't entertain as it's own entity. With the engrossing and fascinating McDowell leading the way in almost every frame. Many have called Kubrick the greatest film maker of all time. Including, among others, the not too shabby himself Martin Scorsese. And after watching 'A Clockwork Orange' and being thrilled by it for the umpteenth time. I can find no avenue to disagree. This film is spectacular reel after reel. Do yourself the favor of seeing it for yourself. 10 out of a possible 10. T.H.",10,0,2,1 July 2005
Pulp Fiction," Pulp Fiction changed the way cinema looked at movie dialogue
","Writer and director Quentin Tartentino reportedly worked in a video store for a time. No doubt it was during this period when he decided he'd had his fill of formulated and prosaic conversations between actors. And contrived plots which plodded towards unsatisfying finales wrought with gunfire and unnecessary explosions. You will find no such nonsense in Tarentino's masterpiece 'Pulp Fiction' With a complex and extremely entertaining plot, which is filmed out of sequence, a device which sometimes confuses audiences. Not here as the whole thing plays out and comes together like a puzzle which everyone is having a lot of fun putting together. It is the story of a boxing fix. two handgun wielding robbers and two hit men all interwoven together and connecting at some point. But the most amazing thing about Pulp Fiction is the dialogue. The actors talk about normal everyday things, not just points to move along the plot or set up a conclusion. A good example of this occurs early in the film while the two hit men, played by John Travolta in his Academy Award nominated come back roll as Vince Vega, and Samuel L. Jackson, also nominated for Hollywood's biggest prize, as Jules, the second of the contract killers, are driving in a car on their way to an ordered murder. They begin talking about Vega's recent trip to Europe. There is a reference to various fast food restaurants. And Vega comments that because of the metric system in France the Quarter Pounder at McDonald's is called a Royal with cheese. The ease at which the actors speak the dialogue freely helps to create a realistic atmosphere where it seems like two people are just talking. Someone might say that two men on their way to a brutal execution might not be on the subject of fast food. But who's to say where normal or abnormal conversation might lead. Tarentino caught on to this before anyone else. And this is the most ingenious thing about the film. That and the fact that the scenes are funny, original and thrilling all at the same time. The film also has fine performances from Tim Roth, Eric Stoltz, Ving Rhames, and Bruce Willis among others. But none better than Jackson, who's roll as the repentant hit man developing a conscience wasthe breakout part this tremendous American actor needed to finally achieve the recognition he deserves. He is comical and reverent in his newfound religion all at the same time. Also look for Harvey Kietel, in a swell cameo as 'The Wolf' a man called in to clean up messes which you can't tidy up yourself After this film came out, many imitators cropped up and tried to copy Tarentino's writing style. Along with his obsession with 70s black exploitation films and karate movies. But this film is positively one of a kind. It could easily be the best film of its decade. Groundbreaking. 10 out of a possible 10 T.H.",10,0,1,21 June 2005
War of the Worlds," Spielberg Doesn't need Cruise for this action packed 'War'
","'War of the Worlds is a very impressive remake of the very impressive original. The 1953 classic starring Gene Barry is equally as spectacular when placed in the perspective of its own era. The 2005 version stars superstar Tom Cruise as everyman Ray Ferrier. A divorced father of two who is hosting his teenage son ( Justin Chatman ) and his ten year old daughter ( Preteen flavor of the month Dakota Fanning )for the weekend. While their mother ( Ferrier's ex ) is vacationing at her parents house with their wealthy stepfather. Cruise's teenage son is not too happy with this arrangement or with his dad for that matter. And there are various references to Cruise's irresponsibility and selfishness and right away you know that Cruise will end being a hero based on the criteria of this formula. Well it isn't long before the weather anomalies associated with these types of disaster films line the sky. And the Ferrier household turns from fighting each other to staring in awe at the late Autumn sky which is full of black cloudy vortexes. You know the rest. The invaders take the city by storm. And here is where we begin to see Spielberg's spectacular touch. These effects are nothing short of breathtaking. As the hidden aliens ride gigantic tripods, which are sort of reminiscent of the 'Imperial Walker's' in George Lucas's ' The Empire Strikes Back'. Only much more frightening and foreboding when placed in a real scenario like New York. Actually the effects themselves are the star of this film. Cruise might be too fine of an actor for something with this much action. Just check out some of his sublime performances like those Oscar nominated rolls in 'Magnolia' or 'Born on the Fourth of July' if you need a reference point. Someone like Gene Barry, who has a cameo as the Grandfather in this adaptation. was more than capable of doing the work without distracting us from the film's excellent special effects. That's not to say that Cruise doesn't have some scenes which require difficult acting. One of the best scenes of the film involves a mob attempting to steal the van which the Ferrier family commandeered from their local garage after all things electrical are blacked out by the aliens. Cruise handles the panic, fear and rage like the seasoned veteran he has become. Even though he could be accused of overacting at times, the whole premise is over the top. Eventually the family makes it to the cellar of a burned out farm, where the encounter the reclusive surviver of a wiped out family, portrayed in an extended cameo by Tim Robbins. Here Spielberg and Co continue to dazzle us with fantastic other world visions. And when a snaking eye comes into the cellar searching for survivors of the carnage above, we are reminded of the suspenseful kitchen raptor scene in 'Jurassiac Park'. Genarally the film is pretty dark. From the insidious intent of the raiders to the execution of their evil plan, some parts may be too frightening for smaller children. Over the years Spielberg has proved to be one of the greatest, if not the greatest film makers of any era. One of his specialties is the Summer blockbuster and he executes that genre to perfection once again here. Although even the mighty Spielberg isn't immuned to the occasional clunker, you will find no such worries here. It's a good film to see on a Summer Saturday night. It's a good film period. 7 out of a possible 10 T.H.",7,0,1,5 July 2005
Blade Runner," Film Noir for the 21st Century. Blade Runner has style and substance.
","Adopted from the novel by Phillip K. Dick. Blade Runner is a blend of 1940s private detective yarns and futuristic society landscapes. Beautifully shot on stunning stylized sets by director Ridley Scott, fresh off another totally original success with his earlier film, 'Alien' Scott manages to create a future as unpredictable as the actual passing of time. Bizarre neo- Victorian dance fashions. Chinese vendors and gigantic hologram advertisements, hovering cars locked on an invisible monorail, that even now twenty three years later still manage not to resemble an 82 Pinto. The main sci-fi story centers around Deckard ( Harrison Ford ) Who is a 'Blade Runner' That is a cop who specializes in one field. His area of expertise is locating and destroying 'replicants'. Android slaves with a built in four year life span, which is apparently a couple of years too long for their uptight creators when they jump an off world shuttle and slaughter the entire crew in the process. They then return to earth in an effort to blend into normal society. Where it's Deckard's job to hunt them down. Fans looking for a reprisal of Ford's Han Solo roll will not find it here. Deckard is somewhat more downtrodden than the upbeat Captain of the 'Millinaum Falcon' From the outset, Deckard seems burned out, and has to be blackmailed into doing the job. He is much more stern and serious for this sci-fi fantasy. Unlike 'Star Wars' there is nothing for children in this movie. This is a dark tale, conveyed by director Scott's stark use of pale color and shadow. Ford's quiet understatement and pauses when delivering his lines really sets the bleak tone well and he's always giving the audience the impression that Deckard isn't the bad ass he once was. It's a fine performance by Ford, but Rutger Hauer as the Nexus six android Roy Batty steals the show. As he and his gang of fugitives try to figure out how to reverse the four year life span while staying one step ahead of Deckard, Hauer as Batty makes you afraid for the people they are interrogating. In the end even Deckard seems terrified of the violent and murdering Batty. Hauer's oratory summery during one of the final scenes is moving and memorable. Also look for E. Emmet Walsh in another strong supporting role as Deckard's overbearing and wisecracking boss. All in all, there isn't too much bad you can say about 'Blade Runner.' If I had one knock, it would be that I didn't feel the date was pushed far enough into the future. Even when the film came out in 1982 it seemed that technology wouldn't have the chance to catch up to the premise. I think Dick and company would have been better served had they tried for the latter part of the 21st century rather than the first part. But this is one small bolt loose in an otherwise tight machine. Blade Runner is a fantastic marvel. 9 out of a possible 10 T.H.",9,0,1,21 June 2005
