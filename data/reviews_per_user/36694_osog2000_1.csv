Skyfall," Not as good as Casino Royale
","Skyfall is a great movie because it has mystery, action and adventure, and it was filmed in beautiful cities such as Istanbul, London etc...Daniel Craig's Bond has a wonderful mystery in this movie, for me Casino Royale is a better movie than Skyfall, but it has magnificent scenery and the action scenes had me on the edge of my seat. The opening scene has the greatest impact I have ever seen in a Bond movie. It was a great decision to use Adele for the theme tune.The villain Javier Bardem has a spectacular character and for me he is the perfect enemy. The flashbacks to his childhood showed his weaknesses and why he became an angry and violent man. I strongly recommend you see this movie.",8,1,4,16 January 2013
