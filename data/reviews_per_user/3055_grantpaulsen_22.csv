Ford v Ferrari," An enjoyable Oscar bait movie
","Ford v Ferrari is clearly comes from a place of heart and a very talented director. The car races in this movie are dramatic, incredibly tense, and very well shot. There's a lot of production value and effort that went into making this film and it shows. The directing was probably the best part, no real issues there. I love James Mangold as well as almost all his films, so I'll always support him and I can't wait to see what else he does. This film was pretty strong from a technical standpoint, the cinematography, the editing, the sound mixing & editing, and the visuals were all great. The acting was pretty great, especially from Christian Bale. I really enjoyed Matt Damon and his performance, as well as the endlessly fun, charming, and believable friendship and dynamic that he shares with Bale. I liked his character and I think he had enough development for what screen time he had, but at the same time his character didn't feel that special or unique, but I did enjoy his character. In terms of acting though I think Matt Damon gets pretty outshined by Christian Bale. That just goes to show that he's one of the best actors working today, he worked on this film coming off of Vice, and if you've seen that movie then you would know that he looks radically different in this film. It's kind of amazing how much and how quickly he can lose and gain weight or a role. He's an actor who can disappear into his characters and he never feels like he's acting, and he can play such a wide range of characters, I mean this guy played Batman for crying out loud. He fully dedicates himself to all of his roles and he's one of my favorite actors who will always have my undying gratitude. In fact this might be his best performance that I've seen from him in a long time. His character is very well developed and the vulnerability on display is captivating to say the least. The film is very fast paced for the most part and it was pretty fun to watch. It got a little boring at times, and there were some points in the middle that lost my investment, but other than that this film kept my attention for the majority of the run time. And yeah the story is a little drawn out, not everything in this film was necessary or justified, they could've trimmed off maybe 20 minutes. My last issue is that it's one of those movies that is pretty pandering in terms of it's message and it's story, it's fairly cookie cutter and predictable. And it's one of those films that is just screaming that it's going for Oscars and it's very obvious, it's kind of an Oscar bait movie is what I'm trying to say. But despite some issues I really enjoyed this film, it's not amazing and I'm in no rush to see it again, but I'd recommend seeing this one in theaters, because the sound and visuals are so immersive that it makes this film a very theatrical experience. See it with a good sound set up as well.",6,1,13,15 November 2019
Rocketman," Wow! Taron Edgerton is Oscar material!
","This was probably the biggest surprise film so far this year. I was not anticipating this film at all, but I thought it was great! The performances were pretty stellar, Taron Edgerton gives an Oscar worthy performance in this film. Jaime Bell and Richard Madden were also great. This truly is a musical fantasy, it was stylish and different which I loved. The directing wasn't anything special, although there were some long takes that I appreciated. The structure was a little flimsy, it was a little too long, the pacing was a little boring and repetitive in some areas, but not overall. It also follows your typical biopic formula, but it's pretty unique on its own, so overall that overshadows it's familiar formula. Overall I loved this film, and I hope Taron Edgerton is not overlooked in this year's Oscar season.",6,1,2,3 June 2019
Captain Marvel," Honestly, I was hoping for better.
","This is a very controversial Marvel film. Which seems to be a running trend with Disney films recently. The hype around this film seems to be very mixed, some want it to succeed and some want it to fail, and both sides seem to have these viewpoints due to various political reasons. There seems to be a lot of agendas involved. I do not have any stake in either side because I do not care about this kind of thing when it comes to film. I don't think it's fair to judge films from that perspective in a positive or negative way. In the same sense that I don't think it's fair to judge a film from a positive or negative perspective based on whether or not you like the actors involved. I don't care if films succeed or fail financially. Film is an art form to me and I just want to see films that are well-made by people who have a lot of passion for their craft.
To start with things I liked, there's some spurts of entertainment that come from this film. Some fun action scenes, the chemistry between Brie Larson and Samuel Jackson was very on point. The de-aging effects for Samuel Jackson and Clark Gregg were surprisingly great. The first act overall was relatively enjoyable, especially the opening action scene. The music/score was pretty good. And the cat was a fun addition. But overall the film was very bland and disappointing.
Honestly, I was hoping for better. To me a superhero movie needs to have an interesting story, well developed characters, and it needs to grab me and make me care about what's going on. This applies to film in general. One of the saddest things about this film that I was genuinely hoping I wouldn't have to say is that I don't think Brie Larson did a good job in this film. Brie Larson is an incredibly talented actress so I don't necessarily think she's to blame for that, it might have just been the poor material she was given to work with. As the film progresses she gets increasingly more stoic, and the film never showcases any emotion or vulnerability towards the character for some reason. And her character is given almost all backstory with too much exposition and very little depth. And at the same time there isn't enough given to make you care about her or any of the characters. Overall I don't think she fit the character, the performance was very wooden and uneven. Which is sad to say because you can tell how much passion she's giving towards this character.
The narrative is so scattered that she kind of gets lost in the shuffle & they forget to develop her character. Which was disappointing for me. The storytelling was very messy. This film is trying to be an origin story, a connecting piece to the past as well as to what's going on now, and a set up film for what's to come later. So the film kind of collapsed in on itself because it's trying to do too many things at once.
This honestly felt like Phase 1, which is not a good thing. That's not to say that Iron Man and The Avengers weren't good, it's just that this film feels a lot like the early Marvel films in the sense that it felt like they were still in an experimental phase. They were still trying to figure out what works and what doesn't work about their films. They've passed that point and they know what works by now so this film as well as all the other new ones should be progressive steps forward, and this film was definitely a gigantic step backwards.
They also don't do a good job making this character feel important or relevant to what's currently going on in the MCU. We're told she's the most powerful character in the MCU, but they never show us that or make us feel that way. The film is a lot of telling rather than showing. Needless to say the writing and directing were pretty lackluster. Also the action other than the opening was not very good or memorable at all.
The Skrulls were fun villains, and relatively unique compared to other Marvel villains, but they weren't really given any character.
There was a lot of fun 90s references but I think the film relies on this as a crutch way too much. Which caused the tone to be very disjointed. They have 90s nostalgia for a little bit, then it feels like a buddy cop film with Nick Fury, and then it's a story about the friendship between her and Lashana Lynch's character. And there's no effort given to make the audience feel emotionally invested in any of these stories. And since it's always jumping back and forth between these contrasting tones, and that made the film uneven as a result.
There are some needless explanations for things that happen in the MCU and when they happened it felt corny and forced.
The film was a fun time but this is the 21st Marvel Cinematic Universe film, so at this point generic fun action films are old and tired. And since there have been dozens of Marvel films at this point they need to live up to a higher standard. So in order for me to like their films at this point they have to do something more than just making a fun movie. I can't believe I'm saying this but DC did it better. Wonder Woman had charm, charisma, and character development. And I Captain Marvel definitely fell flat in this regard. Again, there are moments of potential here, but they are hiding under the bland cliched Marvel formula. It's a very generic film that we've seen many times before not just when it comes to superhero movies, and I was hoping for more than that. 5/10.
Please see the film though and make up your own opinion on it. Don't listen to what others say, don't give in to online agendas no matter what side they're on. Just go see the film, make up your own mind, and when you do be honest about it, because that's how we get better films, by letting the filmmakers know what works and what doesn't work about their films.
But at the end of the day the fact that this film didn't live up to its potential doesn't matter, and I'm still very excited because...

Us," Another home run for Jordan Peele!
","Us is a great new horror film. One kind that, similar to Hereditary, we don't get very often. This is one special film. It's haunting and dramatic, this film has some really good social commentary and comedy interwoven. I love that Get Out was horror comedy with much more social commentary interwoven. Us is more of a straight up horror film which I liked. Lupita Nyong'o was incredible in this film, she gave an Oscar-worthy performance. She had one of the best performances and best characters I've seen in a horror film. This film leaves quite a lot of aspects open to interpretation. This is the kind of film that begs you to watch it multiple times because of how ambiguous it is, which I love because the this is the type of film where you will get something new out of it, you'll notice things that you didn't notice on the first viewing. Which is not done out of laziness, it was very purposeful. In fact I personally would've left the film even more ambiguous. But wow I am very impressed, Jordan Peele is the new master when it comes to horror films and I can't wait to see what he does next. Us gets a 9/10 from me.",4,1,6,20 March 2019
Knives Out," A Good Old-Fashioned Whodunnit
","This was such a fun whodunnit that was pretty hilarious and well acted. Chris Evans and Ana De Armas bring such powerhouse performances in this film. The dialogue is witty and well written, there are twists and turns that I did not see coming. I think Rian Johnson is not as clever as he thinks he is, the script is solid and pretty tight, but in the end it's nothing different from what we've already seen before. I suppose that's my biggest issue, I'm not sure I'd say it's a different take on the whodunnit genre like some others have said, because in the end it's just the same old trick. The message and the commentary in this film was pretty obvious, ham fisted, and heavy handed. There are some other elements to the story that were stupid, but other than that it was a thoroughly enjoyable film with an amazing cast, great acting, a solid script, and pretty good directing.",9,6,26,24 November 2019
The Irishman," One of Scorsese's Finest
","This film was a surprisingly subdued character study. Yes it's a mob film, but it's not about the mob, it's about the characters, Frank 'The Irishman' Sheeran (Robert De Niro), Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), and Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci). There's a lot of subtle character development, and a lot of context is provided to understand the characters and the point of the story, hence the 3 and a half hour runtime. But all that context is necessary, and every scene was necessary so I believe the runtime is justified. This film honestly feels like a novel, it's not a story about one topic, it's a story that encompasses one man's entire life. The writing is superb, the directing and cinematography are fantastic, the acting is top notch, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and especially Joe Pesci. It was so good to see him back in a film because he's pretty much retired at this point, but Scorsese convinced him to come back for one last film and I'm so glad we got one more amazing performance from this legend. He's so subtle, quiet, and yet very threatening, like he's going to have your entire family murdered if you cross him.Martin Scorsese is one of my favorite filmmakers, he's very inspirational to me, and into his 70s, not only has this guy not had a misstep yet, but he's still making top quality films this late in his career. This is one of the year's best films, please see it as soon as you can. I hope this one gets a lot of well deserved award recognition from The Academy.",10,9,23,25 November 2019
Megamind," A Subversive and Surprisingly Great Dreamworks Film
","What a surprise! I saw this as kid and I thought it was boring. I was so shocked to find out how subversive, compelling, and well written this film is. It still has some ex machinas, cliches, and Dreamworks-isms that they do in all their films, and those could've been removed. But aside from those, I was shocked at how much I loved this film.",8,2,2,25 July 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," One of the Worst and Most Disappointing Star Wars Films
","I've never walked out of a Star Wars movie more disappointed than I was with this one. It's even worse than The Last Jedi. It honestly makes The Last Jedi more tolerable. The dialogue is AWFUL, and it's just as bad and sometimes worse than the prequels. There is SO MUCH exposition, it feels like a video game. The plot is so loose and bad, it basically revolves around going to get a macguffin to get another macguffin and they keep doing that until the final battle. It's that bad. None of the old or new characters are developed in this film, the story is not interesting or developed at all. It's honestly a really bad plot that's barely held together by fan service and nostalgia. There's an 'Avengers Assemble' type moment at the end of this film that is forced, and I didn't care about ANY of it. I found Kylo's turn to be very rushed and way too easy. He couldn't be swayed once and there isn't enough development in this film or TLJ to make his turn convincing. I hated it, this further shows how unimaginative the writers are and the lack of creativity and uniqueness in this film along with the whole trilogy. Darth Vader 2.0, really?! Also the Sith Fleet is literally just the Death Star again, THE FOURTH FLIPPING TIME! JJ can you not come up with anything original?! Reylo kiss was laugh out loud levels of bad and extremely forced and cringeworthy. The Emperor stuff, his plan, and the explanation (or lack there of) of how he's here and how he's been able to do what he's been doing is honestly laughable and embarrassing. The choice to bring back the Emperor just felt like a desperate move by the filmmakers, and in the end the choice did not feel justified at all, and it kind of ruins the importance and impact of Vader's sacrifice in the OT. Rey's character was vastly disappointing in this film as well, and there's a choice made with her character that was so cheap and gimmicky and it lessens the impact of the story. And I can't believe I'm saying this, but the humor in this film is more embarrassing and cringeworthy than it was in the prequels as well as The Last Jedi. Palpatine creating Snoke was a cop out and further shows that they had no plan going into this trilogy and his inclusion was a desperate attempt to have a threatening antagonist, and they failed miserably. I almost laughed out loud when Kylo got YEEEEEETed off the cliff by Palpatine. Sigh. I have never been more disappointed in a Star Wars movie before.",1,36,69,20 December 2019
Yesterday," Disappointing
","Danny Boyle is a director that I usually like, but unfortunately this film disappointed me. I thought it was very cliched and filled to the brim with tropes and bad, cringeworthy dialogue. I thought the acting was good, and the premise was interesting, but they don't live up to the potential of that premise. Because rather than exploring the interesting questions that this premise entails like how the world, the music industry, and our understanding of music would change if The Beatles were never a thing, they instead just use this as a strange, needlessly complex way of telling a by the books romance. Overall I wouldn't exactly recommend this film, and I was pretty disappointed.",5,219,402,20 June 2019
Toy Story 4," To Infinity and Beyond!
","Pretty good flick. It never really justifies its existence though, and it doesn't have the emotional impact I think it needed (especially if it's the last one). The story feels really inconsequential for the first half at least, and one of the side characters was kinda pointless. There's also a lot of plot conveniences that I found stupid, and sometimes this film relied on contrivances way too much (especially the part at the end with the RV). Don't get me wrong the previous films had that too, but I don't think the previous three relied on them that much. Also I think the overall story could've used some more development, I cared about the characters and what was happening because of my investment in the previous films, but this one not so much. I think it's good enough to make me invested it's just not on the level that I think it should be. My last complaint is that I wish the old gang got more screen time, specifically Jessie, and especially Buzz given the outcome of the story. However, I love everything they did with Woody and Bo Peep, I also love the new characters especially Forkey and Duke Kaboom (Keanu Reeves is perfect as always). There's a long tracking shot of two characters walking that I loved, and there's a scene with rain in the film and it's absolutely stunning. The visuals and animation are perfect, almost photo realistic at this point. Also the humor is pretty good, there were some jokes that I found to be genuinely hilarious, this film might actually be the strongest in terms of humor. Tom Banks's voice acting performance in this film as Woody is absolutely perfect, this might actually be his best in the franchise, other than maybe the third film. Once I've had more time to think about the film and see it again, my rating may go up. I know that I really liked this film, but not as much as the trilogy. In terms of Pixar sequels I would say this takes the edge over films like, 'Finding Dory', 'Incredibles 2', 'Monsters University', and all the Cars films of course. In conclusion, Toy Story 4 feels like the 'optional' epilogue that comes after the perfect ending to a story that you love, but it's a pretty good 'optional' epilogue.",4,1,4,22 June 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," One of Tarantino's Finest Works
","From the first frame of this film I could tell that I was in the hands of a filmmaker who has an insane amount of love and respect for their craft as well as the art form. This film has a very distinct tone and pace to it that is very different and unique for Tarantino. It's very reserved and mature, and I like that he's evolving as a filmmaker. His gimmicks and tropes are very held back to nonexistent in this film, and then he throws in something very special and satisfying towards the end for his fans. And despite the slow pace, the film managed to keep me invested and thoroughly entertained for the entire runtime. Which is entirely due to the fact that this film is more character driven than it is story/plot driven.This film plays out more like a loosely connected series of scenes rather than a flowing narrative. And despite the looser focus, the characters, themes, and motivations feel significantly more important and fleshed out compared to some of his other films. In fact I would go as far as to say that the main characters in this film are the most well written and fleshed out since Pulp Fiction. Scenes that some may consider pointless, I would not consider as such because they exist to flesh out the characters. This film is very respectful and laid back in its portrayal of Sharon Tate, which was refreshing after seeing the abomination that is The Haunting of Sharon Tate (2019). Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth have very compelling storylines and are the best characters Tarantino has made since Jules from Pulp Fiction. Brad Pitt gives one of the best performances of his career in this film, and Leonardo DiCaprio was amazing as always. All the acting in this film from the main cast was Oscar worthy.The cinematography and set design of this film was emasculate. The glossy recreation of 1969 Hollywood was very impressive. I appreciated the authenticity and attention to detail of the sets. They went to great lengths to physically recreate Hollywood in 1969, filled to the brim with almost entirely practical effects, and very little digital recreation. The most impressive aspect of this is the abundance of long takes with Brad Pitt driving his car through the streets of 1969 Hollywood and yet the illusion of realism is never broken, and as he goes down every block it feels no less real than the last.As always with Tarantino, the film is very dialogue driven, which is as sparse, well written, and witty as always. The plot is loose, as stated before, and also simple, and yet is still unpredictable and suspenseful. The film relies on comedy more so than any other Tarantino film. Despite some ridiculous moments, the film has more to say than some of his recent films.The ending feels very much like Quentin Tarantino's style coming out. It was very satisfying for me and should satisfy most of his fans. I feel like it was very purposeful and surprisingly set up and fitting. This ending could make or break your experience, or you might think it's the only good part if you don't like slow burns. I found my jaw to be on the floor during the final scene, I was also laughing hysterically. The resolution to Rick Dalton's storyline was very clever commentary on heroism, how we perceive it, and how much violence we excuse in films by chalking it up to heroism. It was an impeccably set up and well constructed conclusion.Quentin Tarantino is one of my favorite filmmakers and I'm always happy to see him expand, evolve, and take risks. I like that he found a way to do something new and meaningful rather than sticking to his same old shtick. I hope he is rewarded with a lot of Oscar recognition for this film (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Actor/Actress, Best Cinematography, Best Set Design, Best Score, Best Sound Design, all of it). This is one of my favorite Tarantino films and one of the best films I've seen so far this year.",9,20,36,20 August 2019
Aladdin," Aladdin (2019) Misses the Mark
","Disney's latest live action remake misses the mark, proving once again that these live action remakes aren't working. They're made for financial benefit, but the quality of the film dips from the original by adding completely unnecessary characters and plot points that were cut from the original for a reason. The acting from Will Smith and Naomi Scott was surprisingly the best part of the film. The rest of the actors were really bad, especially the actor who played Jafar. He was terrible as this character, he was not intimidating in the slightest. I can't believe that an animated cartoon character was somehow more menacing and scary than a real actor. The acting overall in this film felt like stage play acting, very over exaggerated facial expressions and body language, which works well on stage, but doesn't translate well to film. The singing was pretty bad too, you could tell the actors, other than Will Smith, couldn't sing so their voices are very heavily auto tuned and it sounds really bad. The directing was very bland, it had no style to it. It honestly looks like a soap opera you'd find on the Lifetime channel. With all these elements mixed in, as a result, nothing about this film felt authentic in any way. These live action remakes need to have more effort put into them writing wise.",4,37,77,22 May 2019
Schindler's List," Steven Spielberg's Masterpiece
","I've been putting this film off for a long time now, and I regret doing so. This film is a beautiful portrait of the life of a great man, and it's a beautiful love letter to all the people who lost their lives as well as their families that lived. The writing is spectacular, the directing is Spielberg's best, the cinematography is beautiful, and the stylistic touch adds a lot of meaning to the experience. This film features such gravitas performances delivered by Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley, probably the best I've seen from both of them. And Ralph Fiennes was somehow more evil and punchable in this film than he was as Lord Voldemort, but still a great performance nonetheless. This film carries so much emotional weight, it's definitely not an easy film to watch, and I can't see myself watching it over and over again, but it is without a doubt in my mind, Spielberg's best work to date.",10,0,1,11 April 2020
The Lion King," Why?
","I left the theatre with one thought in my head, 'why?' I fail to see why this was remade other than for money, because there is no sort personality or style of its own, and this remake doesn't offer any new kind of spin on this story, it's basically a shot for shot remake of a film that's already a classic. Why would I ever choose to watch this over the original? It's basically the same movie just without the personality and style of the original. With the photorealistic animals, you can't sympathize with any of them because they don't have any kind of expression, and therefore they can't express emotion. This just goes to show that there was a reason the film was animated in the first place. Also the original was a film that Disney didn't want to make at first, the artists were so passionate about this story that they started to make it anyways out of their own garage and no support from a studio, and yet they still crafted the greatest Disney film of all time. And now that same studio is using their story and milking it for money, because they know how popular it is, which is kind of slimey in my opinion. I can't give it a 0.5/5 because the visuals are spectacular, but none of the changes made to this film were for the better, and nothing of their own was added really. The only difference between this film and the original is that some scenes were shortened and some were drawn out, and all those scenes were terribly executed. So I ask again, when you're remaking something that you know you can't improve, and something that you're not going to change or add your own spin on, then why? Why remake it? It's already a classic, you're just redoing what is already perfect, but you're doing it without the passion, personality, and perfect execution. So, the only reason I can think of is, money.",2,56,84,19 July 2019
1917," Nail-Biting, Intense Experience
","I got to see this film for a second time tonight, and it was even better than the first time. This film is a technical marvel. Roger Deakins is the greatest cinematographer to ever live, and he should win an Oscar once more for this film. I don't agree that the story and characters were surface level. I thought the acting was great and very underrated. I thought they were a step above most war films and because of that this made for one of the best war films I've ever seen. The cinematography combined with the score made for one of the most emotional and nail biting experiences of the year. It's not my favorite or the best out of the Best Drama nominations at the Golden Globes, but it definitely deserved the win as well as Best Director. It's one of the best films of the year, it opens wide this Thursday, go see it as soon as possible.",9,1,4,8 January 2020
Midsommar," Sadly Disappointing
","Maybe I need some more time to think about it, but as of right now I am very disappointed in this film. I didn't hate it, I loved the cinematography, shot composition, and Florence Pugh's performance was pretty fantastic. Some of the other actors were good and some others were not so good. I love Ari Aster and his direction, and I loved his previous film Hereditary, which makes this one even more disappointing. I thought it was pretty repetitive and boring, there were a lot of scenes I felt could've been cut, and it probably would've been better. Also, I thought the film was quite pretentious and self indulgent. This was one of my most anticipated films of the year and I wish I could've liked it more.",8,244,474,3 July 2019
There Will Be Blood," THIS FILM IS THE THIRD REVELATION!
","Wow. Just wow.I've had that Anton Ego moment before when a film closes and I am just blown away by how amazing the film was, but I'm not sure I ever have been as much as I was when this film ended. I was transfixed to the screen and by the end of it I was reminded why I review films in the first place and why I love filmmaking!THIS FILM IS THE THIRD REVELATION!I am so speechless that I don't even know what to say. The acting, dear Neptune, the acting! Daniel Day-Lewis has provided us with not only one of if not the best performances of all time, but also one of the most thoroughly entertaining and memorable characters ever to be put on film, Daniel Plainview. An insane, but charismatic sociopath filled to the brim with determination and hatred, just so complex and interesting. Paul Dano was absolutely fantastic as well. This film was a period piece, but it also is one of the deepest and most interesting character studies I've ever seen! The score for this film is intense and epic. The cinematography is emasculate. The writing and directing are insanely perfect. Every single scene is interesting, entertaining, and just perfect.Paul Thomas Anderson is an absolute genius. He is a masterful writer and director. He crafts his films meticulously in a way that no one else could. He's become one of my favorite directors, and the way he writes his scripts and his dialogue is just so precise, energetic, and perfect. The ending of the film, wow. It might be one of my favorite endings to a film ever. I love No Country for Old Men (2007), but I think this should've won the Oscar for Best Director and Best Picture. This film has rocked me to my core.Thank you, Paul Thomas Anderson, for gifting us with one of the most breathtaking masterpieces of all time. I need to let this film sit for a while, but this could now potentially be in my top 5 favorite films of all time.",10,1,4,15 March 2020
Joker," Joker is Very Well Written, One of the Best Films of 2019
","Joker is one of my favorite films of 2019. I thought this was a pretty tight script, don't have any issues with the writing of this film. While Joaquin Phoenix doesn't surpass Heath Ledger, I think he definitely made this role his own, I loved his performance, and I think he deserves an Oscar nomination. Along with Adapted Screenplay and perhaps Best Picture. This film is very much so inspired by Martin Scorsese and his films, Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, and it compliments those films in a loving way. I personally didn't think it was derivative of those films and I personally liked it more than The King of Comedy. All the other performances were great, the film was beautifully shot, the cinematography and shot composition were great. I loved the score, this is all around just a very well acted drama that's a very deep, psychologically disturbing, and well written character study. I cannot wait to see it again.",9,2,4,4 October 2019
It Chapter Two," A Satisfying But Slightly Underwhelming Sequel
","It Chapter Two is a satisfying but slightly underwhelming sequel. It concluded the story in a satisfying way and was faithful to the book. The performances were all fantastic across the board namely Bill Hader, James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, and Bill Skarsgard. Surprisingly this film was much more of a comedy than a horror film, and I loved that personally, and the humor was definitely intentional, I was not laughing at it as some have said they did. This is unironically the funniest film I've seen so far this year. The humor always worked for me and was always funny and clever. I liked the script and the writing a lot from a dialogue perspective, if not from a plotting perspective. And I did find some meaning behind this film not being scary, but at the same time that's a problem with the film. The opening scene deeply unsettled me, but I don't think the film ever got to that point again in terms of horror. Plus that scene didn't end up affecting the story at all. There's a character in this film who served no purpose and could've been cut out entirely. I realize this character was in the book but an adaptation needs to know what works for the film and what needs to be cut out, and this character definitely did because he/she didn't impact the narrative at all. There's a lot of retread and flashbacks in this film, and while some are meaningful, some are pointless. The execution of the second act was poorly written and meandering, one specific set piece in the second act could've been removed entirely, plus the narrative in the second act is a bit shallow. The scenes don't flow together very well and don't connect at all, and there could've been a better way to execute these individual set pieces. The editing, visual effects, and de-aging technology were all bad. Lastly, the film's length, it did not need to be 2 hours and 49 minutes long, they could've easily shaved off 20 - 30 minutes and the film would've been better. Overall, not as good as the first, but still a enjoyable sequel.",3,3,5,7 September 2019
Parasite," Bong Joon-Ho's Masterpiece
","Bong Joon-Ho is a filmmaker whose work I've admired since I saw Snowpiercer (2013). I've had my eyes on him ever since and I'll watch pretty much any film he directs. His newest film Parasite (2019) is not only the best film I've seen from him so far, but it might also be the best film I've seen so far this year. He may have crafted his own masterpiece. This film is sharp, it's tight, and hooks you till the very end. It's very fast paced, it's an extremely intense edge of your seat thriller, and its comedic at times which adds some levity to the film. The performances are all excellent across the board, the script, the dialogue, and the writing are all brilliant, and the score is very intense and enthralling. And to top it all off this film is shot very well, the cinematography and directing are great, and the shot composition is very interesting. And above all else this is just a very fast paced and interesting film that was incredibly fun to watch. I can't wait to see it again, I can't praise this film enough in words. See it as soon as you can, I highly recommend it, and it might be the best film I've seen so far this year!",10,19,30,14 September 2019
Marriage Story," Most Well Written Film in a Long Time. I cried...
","One of the best and most emotional films of the year. I cried. I haven't seen any of Noah Baumbach's previous films but I really want to now after seeing this film. To start off I want to talk about the two main actors, Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver, they are incredible. Their performances are perfect, not only the best I've seen this year, but some of the best I've ever seen. Scarlett's character was one who is asked to showcase a lot of emotion, and I was shocked to see that she was attempting to hold back that emotion for a good portion of the film which made her performance all the more real and powerful. And not held back in the sense that the emotion is not present, but rather in a sense that it's realistic, because when she's speaking around other people it makes sense why the character wouldn't want to cry in front of them. I thought it was so brilliant that she found the perfect point where it looked like she was tearing up but not quite crying. And Adam Driver just brought so much passion and expression to this role. He really immersed himself deep into this character to the point where I forgot I was watching Adam Driver acting and I instead just saw the character. And I think the best kind of acting is the kind where you stop seeing the actor and you just see the character. Quite frankly both of them deserve to win Oscars for these roles. I love Joaquin Phoenix and he's long overdue for an Oscar, but I think Adam Driver deserves it more. The writing for this film was superb, the script and dialogue were perfect. Quite honestly I think this is the best screenplay of the year, I hope the Academy honors it with an Oscar as well. Noah Baumbach did a good job directing as well, there were plenty of long takes that really captured the power of the scene. This film is very character driven and dialogue heavy, it's a very quiet film, nothing miraculous is happening on screen. When it comes to heavily dramatic films such as this one, there's a lot of directors who would attempt to make a lot of scenes over the top, overdramatized, and larger than what they really are or should be. But Noah Baumbach portrays this story about a divorce and all the dramatic scenes in a very realistic manner that never felt over dramatic or went too far, and I thought that was absolutely brilliant. As far as the characters go, they are flawless. They are the most fleshed out and deeply explored characters I've seen this year. They are incredibly interesting and complex. Quite honestly this film showcases a story that's been told before, but it makes all those films that came before it look shallow and underdeveloped. The film doesn't explain the characters to you, it just presents them, and it doesn't take sides with either one, because they are so complex that quite honestly there isn't a good guy or bad guy in this scenario. They're simply just two people who aren't good for each other and are just not working. Whichever one you found yourself siding with, in the end the film makes you realize that it doesn't matter. The score from Randy Newman was also fantastic, it complimented the visuals and conveyed the tone of the film very well. The best aspects of this film were the acting and the writing, so you should see it on those merits alone, and it's on Netflix right now so you can watch it in the comfort of your own home. I thought this was one the best and most powerful films of the year and just so well written.",10,26,54,7 December 2019
Jojo Rabbit," It Was Good
","Jojo Rabbit was a very enjoyable and funny satire. I liked the acting especially from Taika Watiti, and the child actors did a surprisingly good job. I liked the directing and cinematography even though it was nothing exceptional. I thought the writing, dialogue, and script was good overall but again nothing exceptional. I liked the story, themes, and ideas explored in this film, but there were some aspects that didn't work for me. One of the biggest problem was the tone. For almost the entire film the tone is comedic but then sometime in the middle it just switches to completely serious out of nowhere and then just goes back to being comedic. Which causes the film to feel a bit jarring. There's also some emotional beats in the film that didn't work for me, since the film was comedic all the way up until that point I wasn't able to feel any of the emotions the film wanted me to feel. Not to mention the story and characters weren't developed enough to make these parts work which caused these moments to feel unearned and underdeveloped. But I still enjoyed it overall. I don't feel much of a desire to see it again and I don't understand why there's a lot of buzz surrounding this film. I would recommend this film despite some criticisms.",7,20,46,20 October 2019
