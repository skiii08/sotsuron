Hereditary," What the heck was that!?
","As I grow older, I feel films intentionally become more depraved, exploring every dark twisted crevice of human imagination. I get horror films, I've usually been a fan of the genre, A Quiet Place was excellent and there are many in my favorites list. But when I come across films like this, touching on witchcraft, satan worship and pure evil, I can't see them for masterpieces as these subjects are real world (actually happening as we speak). I can disassociate with Freddy Kruger, Jason, Mike Meyers and larger than life creatures, caricatures, etc. that take us on dark journeys, but the real monsters in this world are people. These subjects, I believe, get embedded in our psyche, it's an implantation of evil that is wholly possible in the world. Life does not imitate art, but art imitates life. It feels like more and more TV and movies have the most broken, twisted people as protagonists, there's few 'good' characters these days, its warped vs broken). Media is used as propaganda (Edward Bernays), to set agendas and become part of the human condition and thought processes. Violence is all around and being cultivated. They don't call it the idiot box for nothing. For me, each subsequent scene was more profane than the last, it left me feeling gross and wishing I hadn't seen it. I guess to sum it up, I know (backed by science) IQs are dropping, people increasingly look to pop culture, TV, movies, etc. for guidance on behavior/attitudes. I'm not sure how many folks watch things these days and can easily pick out the programming, subtext and agendas being presented. And if think I'm going to far, whether these writer/directors are in on it, keep in mind movie studios have final say and are constantly selecting and shaping your choices. Want further proof? I worked in the music industry a good while and saw first hand how exec's, record labels and station programmers were bought off, bribed in order to provide a narrow selection of music for the public. You were spoon fed artists that had been selected to be succes's long before you ever heard them. Our lives are largely an illusion with just enough freedom to keep us from rebellion. Yeah, this piece of garbage movie made me get all existential, because this represents the trends in junk we're steadily fed these days. To see 'movie critics' fawn all over this, makes me want to (spoiler alert!) 'lose my head'. Well, what ever. Watch at your own risk. You were warned.",1,1,3,15 September 2018
