The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Teen life
",This movie accurately can describe to teens how they can be both happy and sad. It will help them understand their feelings and mentality much easier than any counselor. They will no longer feel alone. They will learn the struggles of their peers. Also it will teach kids that being gay is not easy so why pick on those who are? It will help them understand why they may have bad relationships. You accept the love you think you deserve. And you can only start being happy when you learn to accept your past for what it is. So if you are a high school student that has gone through a lot this movie might be for you. If you are both happy and sad then this movie is definitely for you.,10,1,2,13 February 2016
