Deja Vu," Needed something obvious to...
","... show where he changed the time line. I love sci-fi and especially time travel, and don't care what rules you come up with as long as you follow them. The only problem I really have with this movie is that he goes back in time and sees why the things he saw in the future were there, meaning that the future he came from included his going back. But if he is going to change the future, there has to be something obvious where he does this, it needs to be something that he knew happened that he is able to change, and then from that point forward everything changes. Plus, that would be a great opportunity for a dramatic visual effect to show that the timeline has been skewed. There is nothing like that, so at what point does the past he goes back to change to the alternate future? Also, to save the people on the ferry, all he had to do was call in a bomb threat and they would have evacuated the ferry. But that would make the end of the movie kind of anti-climactic. I still rate this an 8 out of 10, though, because I really enjoyed it in spite of its pitfalls.",8,0,1,24 June 2007
Transformers," Not really living up to its hype
","I didn't intend to see this movie at first, but after some stellar reviews from friends who I usually agree with in movie selections, I decided to give it a chance. First I will say what I did like about the film.The visual effects were superb. The shots with the transformers transforming were amazingly realistic. My wife told me that there were a few times that she was watching them and thought 'come on, don't take so long...' and then realized that what she was watching was not really happening. Very cool.There were some of the funniest one-liners I've seen in an action movie. Even though I wasn't especially enjoying the film, there were several times that I laughed out loud at a line or sight gag.Now for what I didn't like about the film. First of all, I'm over the whole 'amazing visual effects' effect. Have been since the last LOTR. I don't go see CGI movies because I don't care how amazing the animation is if there isn't a good story. So I see them when I hear there's a good story. To me, Transformers had the effects, and that's it. And I got bored with it.Further, there were too many characters, and none were developed at all. Not to mention that Bernie Mac's cameo was extremely unnecessary and distracting. It appeared that the filmmakers were trying to tug on your heart about certain characters, but you didn't know who they were or care about them. The only character I cared about was Bumblebee, and that was because you just thought he was sweet. Everyone else seemed like people you were looking at while you walk through Wal-Mart's toy section.I paid one dollar to see this through RedBox. I'm glad I didn't spend any more.",4,3,7,15 November 2007
Back to the Future," The time travel film that all time travel films are measured by
","I love sci-fi that is based in reality. By that I mean that you can test the logic defined by the rules set in the film, and it stands up from all angles. Most time travel movies break their rules somewhere. Sometimes it's forgivable, sometimes it's not. But Back to the Future (and its sequels) is as close as I've seen to the perfect logic in a time travel movie. The writers clearly thought this through from all aspects. They defined the rules of time travel that they were going to use (of which there are several to choose from) and they wrote the story around those rules, rather than just making a time travel movie and not thinking through the ramifications of what the characters do.This movie and its sequels remains to this day my absolutely favorite movie(s) of all time. All other time travel movies pale in comparison.",10,1,1,25 March 2007
