Hereditary," A True Contemporary Horror Film
","A movie that runs away from almost every horror movie clichÃ© and manages to leave you distressed and scared at the same time. An incredible work, with a slow and accurate development. The horror of the film is not only in the supernatural, but above all in the anguish of the characters and in the unknown.",9,1,3,15 February 2019
Climax," Real but psychodelic
","The film has a very bad thing to put the human being on the edge of the limit. Gaspar Noe likes to play with psychedelic and human transformations. However, the film could develop a little slower.",8,0,1,16 February 2019
The Favourite," A Sensational Movie
","The film is not for all audiences, the development is slow, full of small symbologies and details.",10,2,7,15 February 2019
