The Expendables 2," Action star awesome
","Anyone else remember the action awesomeness of the 80's and 90's? I really miss it. Nothing but thin story line and gratuitous violence. This movie brought it back real well. Have to say, Bruce Willis, and Chuck Norris look very good for their age. Little older but not much else. Jason Statham is handsome as ever and capable of some really amazing martial arts and knife play (didn't realize he could move that fast). Office didn't age Arnold Swartzenegger very well, and Stallone is definitely looking his age. Lundgren... well I never thought he was the greatest looking man but they really did a lot to make him look bad. Too bad there wasn't more butt kicking from Jet Li. That being said, I don't care what anyone says, those muscles are still rippling, and still awesome to watch. Couple these fantastic action stars with a cheesy script and amazing FX and you have one fun movie. It is wonderful to see some of the best action stars of the last 30 years all in one movie, and still kicking as much butt as they did years ago.Loved the one liners, and the Chuck Norris jokes (told by him, no less). Do it again.",Null,1,3,5 January 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Gene Roddenberry must be rolling over in his grave
","If I could give it a zero, I would. The only thing to save this travesty is Zachary Quinto and cool explosions. If it weren't for him, I'd give it a 1. Really bad acting, coupled with a terrible version of the story of Kahn, and why in the world is everything on the Enterprise glowing like a flashlight? And then they had the gall to use the original Star Trek theme at the end? I can see why many of the old actors have a serious problem with the new movies. This is terrible, really terrible. Gene Roddenberry was greedy as can be, but I think he'd have a serious problem with this version. In the original, he wanted to show that humanity had finally overcome most of the things that caused us problems. The only place these things could still be found was in the expansion regions where it was still the wild west. But in this... everything from the uniforms, the slang, the music, and everything else is EXACTLY as it is now but shinier. Really? This is ridiculous. Abrams should be ashamed.",Null,12,18,14 September 2013
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Loved this movie
",Seriously good time. On the edge of my seat and holding my breath through the whole movie. Awesome story and excellent FX. Worth every penny. Sebastian Stan is someone to watch. Handsome as hell and a great possible career in action movies.About time they gave Samuel l Jackson some more screen time. Not sure what happened to Scarlet Johanson but she looked different somehow. Still gorgeous of course. Lost weight maybe. Still kick butt as Black Widow.As usual Chris Evans is good as captain America. Heard he's getting a tired of the role though. Wish I knew why these stars get involved in movies they know will type cast them a bit if they become a hit then complain about it after.,Null,0,1,28 April 2014
Man of Steel," Pretty good movie with some problems
","I love the super hero movies but no one has been able to get it right since Christopher Reeves. That being said, they still haven't hit gold yet, even with this movie.Mind you, the FX are great and Henry Cavill is just right as Superman. The graphics were simply beautiful. By far the best part of the movie is Russell Crowe as Jor-el. Micheal Shannon did well as General Zod and brought more dimension to him than just 'I want to kill everything for the sake of killing' that Superman 2 brought with Christopher Reeve. Lawrence Fishburn was very cool as Perry White. I absolutely love the fact that we get to know more about Krypton and its people.That being said, there were some glaring problems. The story was a bit disjointed in the beginning (after Krypton) with the creators jumping between different time periods in Cal-el's life. There was wayyyy too shaky cam and it was driving me nuts by the end of the movie. With so much, it was hard to focus on a lot of the scenes and it ended up being a jumbled mess. I'm going to have to watch it multiple times to see what I missed because there's so much happening. I really like Amy Adams. Usually. In this movie, she did not do well as Lois Lane, and there were no sparks between her and Henry Cavill at all. And they seemed to have stunted the story. It was more 'here look at all this stuff everyone else is doing and hey, Superman is involved in it too'. He was getting beat wayyyy too much. He's supposed to be the man of steel, not just 'better than human'.I expected more out of a Chris Nolan movie since he's done so well in the past. Usually when I leave his movies, I leave feeling like I've just been on a heck of a thrill ride, but not this time. It was good. It could have been much much better.",Null,0,2,22 June 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," Terrible movie
","Only two things recover it from a one star... the FX and the girl they chose to play Gwen Stacey.Though, really the worst thing is the person they chose to be Spider-Man. Other than bad acting, and no charisma, he is just plain old wrong for the part. Not to mention he reminds me of Hayden Christensen, though at least Christensen is cute. Why are people giving this movie such high marks? I wish I knew. I'm just really glad I didn't waste my money in the theater and watched it on the premium channels instead. I'd have been really ticked off if I wasted money on this.",Null,2,5,16 March 2013
Twilight," Why are people making such a big deal out of this?
","Its terrible. Just simply terrible.I have always had a thing for vampires, but this is just.... bad.The vampires sparkle in the sunlight, they don't have fangs, and they don't drink blood. Wth? They aren't vampires. I don't know what they ARE but it isn't a vampire.Basically, in this show there are no negatives to being a vampire whatsoever, and every one of the vampires looks and acts like a bunch of little kids.There is nothing at all sexy about this and it might as well be a children's TV show. In fact, I'm embarrassed for the people that made it.Might as well be Bunnicula.I honestly don't know how anyone can stand this movie.Its obviously a teenage girls fantasy and written and directed like someone was reading it out of some teenage girls notebook.Badly directed.Badly written.Horribly acted. The main actress is nothing but a whiny spoiled sullen brat. She can't act worth anything.The main actor/vampire, has got to be one of the ugliest I've seen next to the main vampire on True Blood (who is actually tolerable because he can act). He can't act either.This movie was a waste of two hours of my life that I want back. They should pay ME for watching this crap.",Null,7,9,22 November 2009
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Loved this movie
","Not quite the same bawling my eyes out epicness of the first three, but this was a good movie.Good acting, incredibly beautiful scenery, good story (I didn't really like the books for these movies), good writing, good choice for actors. Loved seeing the old characters and the old actors make their appearance from the original. And sometimes, it was very silly. It still had me cheering at the end just like the first three did. Definitely worth the money. Can't wait for the next one.Hollywood needs more fun, and less copies of old stuff already done, if they will only recognize that fact.",Null,2,7,19 March 2013
2012," So much possibility, and they ruined it
","This movie could have been great. But honestly, it really really sucks.This movie is incredibly predictable every step of the way. Its a pity to see such a badly written script said by these good actors in complete seriousness.You know what this movie is? Its 'people escaping bad stuff'. That's all it is. There's no plot and character development whatsoever, and the movie is bogged down by nothing but more and more special fx.Now, I love special fx. Heck. Transformers was pretty much nothing but special fx. But it did make an effort to give some kind of character development where this movie didn't make the least bit of effort.It rolls from escape to escape to escape with not the least bit of an attempt made to connect to the emotions of the audience.Bad movie. Bad bad movie. And not even B movie bad. B movies usually have a certain charm to them that makes them so bad, they're good. No, this is just plain old bad.The only reason I didn't give this movie a one star is because the FX were cool.",Null,2,3,18 July 2010
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A very badly written fan fic
","Horrible, just horrible. The acting, the script, even the visuals were lacking in comparison with the last 6 (and I cannot believe I'm saying the prequels were better, they were terrible). Disney has just utterly destroyed Star Wars. I can see why Mark Hamill is upset with this. I can't believe the others weren't. They humiliated the Skywalkers. And I do mean ALL of them. Star Wars deserves better. How it EVER was able to get as high a rating as it has, I will never know.",Null,7,11,26 December 2017
Paranormal Activity," I suppose you have to believe in demons for this to affect you deeply.
","The movie is 'OK'. There are some parts that are kind of scary, but nothing scary actually happens until the light goes on in the hallway, there are the sounds of running footsteps up the stair and the bedroom door slams. Everything else can easily be explained as the normal sounds a house makes. After that moment it does get scarier.I have to admit, her being dragged out of bed and down the hall was very realistic and that was incredibly creepy. So was the blood curdling screaming at the end.The footsteps in the powder looked fake.I do wonder why they didn't think to look on the internet to find out information and assistance for it sooner. Micah was obviously computer savvy, so... huh? And why oh why are they running around the house with a camera and not bothering to turn on a light when something creepy is happening? Most normal people would automatically turn on a light, especially when there are strange noises going bump in the night.Now, let me say that I DO believe in ghosts and always have. However, I don't believe in demons, and I would say that idea was put into their minds by the so-called investigator. Doing so gave the spirit a form that it could use to scare them.I can also say this... spirits gain power from your behavior. If you start freaking out like Katie did, they will get stronger. Stay calm and they will leave you be.Anyway... OK movie. Could have been done better.",Null,0,2,15 August 2010
Avatar," Incredible. Breathtaking. Amazing. Beautiful.
","I simply don't have the words because none of those in the title of this review even remotely covers the total amazement that this movie gave me.Admittedly, my husband and I saw this in 3D so it took on a reality that it couldn't otherwise.Honestly, I've never had a reaction to a movie like I did this one. It did more than set me on the edge of my seat.I found myself alternately laughing, crying, cheering, and even shaking in anticipation with each new moment in the movie.I do have to say that it did take about a half hour or so to get into but after that, the world just disappeared around me.There are some definite societal overtones to this movie. It quickly became apparent that this was a social statement about what happened to the native Americans when the Europeans arrived on the continent. But its a statement that honestly cannot be overdone, as its happened to other society's too.The lesson is to learn from history, something that few seem to have done. If we cannot learn from history, we are doomed to repeat it, even if its to an alien race over a century in the future.Be that as it may, the story was still captivating.And rather than taking away from the movie, I found the CGI simply adding to it.It was so real. There are times I caught myself flinching as a stray ash or leaf moved through the image. Like I could reach out and touch what I was seeing.Simply and utterly incredible.James Cameron truly has a masterpiece unlike any I've ever seen. I only hope he gets his due at the awards shows this year, but somehow I doubt it. The awards shows never give it to anyone that actually deserves it when they actually deserve it.",Null,12,21,27 December 2009
Les Misérables," Bravo - had me bawling by the end
","For the first time, Hollywood has managed to get one of these operettas right. I have always wanted to see this on stage, but have never had the opportunity. I've listened to the recording so many times, and the 25th anniversary edition made me cry. But this was unexpected. It is simple and completely excellent.I do have to say though, I wish they had cast someone else as Cosette because her voice just didn't sound quite right.I had absolutely no idea that Russel Crowe and Hugh Jackman could sing like this. Absolutely amazing. Hugh Jackman did Jean Val Jean very very well. The power and accuracy in these two men's voices was just beautiful.The whole thing was an incredibly emotional experience for me and I was crying hard by the end of it. This... this was just purely excellent.",Null,4,7,16 January 2013
Burlesque," Its Coyote Ugly
","But not as well acted.Seriously, I was hoping for more.Small town girl moves to the big city to try to make it big in the entertainment industry complete with gorgeous guy and a breaking at her apartment where she loses everything, half naked girls dancing as sexy as they can on a stage and the new girl who can rock the house with her voice.Really? How can they not have seen this similarity coming from a mile away? I'd love to know how anyone can think this movie is fantastic. Coyote Ugly was better.Aguilara has an excellent voice and I've always loved Cher (lets face it, there's something about the woman thats just plain cool especially considering that she's getting on in years now), plus the musics good. So it gets a 5 out of 10 ran than a 3.",Null,0,1,20 March 2011
The Conjuring," I'm curious why people liked this movie
","And why, in almost all these so called scary movies, 'Satan' behaves like an immature child playing tricks and everyone in the movie falls for it. I mean really, these are petty jokes by what's supposed to be this terrifying being. Think about it. Loud or soft noises, stuff lifting into the air and moving around, scary faces and the like.In the end, the movie seemed rather ridiculous rather than frightening. That being said, the Warrens are and always have been two of the most annoying ghost hunters in the world. To them, absolutely everything is satanic if it's supernatural in nature in any possible way. And that room of haunted stuff? Kinda looks like the room on the TV show Friday the 13th.",Null,3,6,16 September 2013
Mad Max: Fury Road," Horrible
","Why is the rating for this movie so high? It's honestly complete garbage. Mostly cool fx (though some really obviously badly edited) and that's it. This movie wasn't even about Mad Max even if the name was used. It was Charlize Theron (Furious? Seriously? Watching The Chronicals of Riddick were we?) and oh Mad Max makes an appearance too. I want the last two and some hours back. I'd have been better off watching paint dry.What a waste of my time.Bad acting, bad effects, bad story.An actress like Charlize Theron deserves better than this.",Null,11,23,3 September 2015
