The Blair Witch Project," Boring
","I was hoping this movie would be scary. Utterly disappointing. I saw this in the theater with a friend and my parents, my mom wasn't even scared (and for a horror movie not to get her pulse up is truly a rare, rare find). I liked the concept and it could have made a good 10-15 minute short, but for a full length movie it was truly a waste of my time. I just sat there waiting for something, anything, to be scary in this movie. The marketing had to be masterful to make the money it did because the movie deserved to be ignored.",2,0,2,21 November 2002
Finding Nemo," disappointing
","Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the movie. But I expected more. I would call it entertaining and worth a watch, but not up to the level of Monsters Inc. or Dreamworks Shrek. The graphics were awesome, but I left with a feeling that is could have been a better movie. I went with my friend and his 5 year old and there were some parts that were a bit scary for him (the 5 year old, not my friend). He still enjoyed the movie however. The story seems to resonate with the parents I talked to which may explain why it has such a high rating. I just expected a little more.",6,0,1,24 June 2003
The Beach," Absolutely Awful
","OK I thought the only rating of 1 I would ever give would be to Hollywood High, but this movie almost matches it's awfulness. At least Hollywood High knew it was just an excuse to show some nudity (it was however mistaken in thinking it was a comedy). I digress. The point being that The Beach had no idea what it wanted to be. Is it a love story, and adventure, a psychological drama, a drama... who knows. Every time it seemed like it had finally made up it's mind the story line would change and ramble incoherently in another direction. I was speechless after watching it. I demand 2 hours of my life back, ok I know I can't get it but how about an apology for wasting my time (and my $ back if it isn't too much trouble). The only thing worth seeing in this movie is the beautiful scenery, but you can get that on the travel chanel for free.",1,1,5,16 October 2002
The Princess Bride," Don't let the title scare you off guys
","I had a bit of a hard time getting my friends to watch this movie. What self respecting dude would watch a movie called 'The Princess Bride' with his buddies? Well let me tell you I have yet to meet someone who has seen this movie and didn't love it. A great comedy with so much fun, laughter, action, and touching in just the right spots. The power of 'true love' may be the driving force for the characters in the movie, and probably what some women viewers would focus on (hint to guys, rent this with your girl and you'll get points for the romance and it'll actually be a movie you'll enjoy. What can I say chicks dig the whole fairy tale aspect, and you'll like everything else). The comedy, characters, and even some action are what make this a movie for everyone. This is a fantasy and comedy period. But who says a comedy can't touch your heart in just the right amount ... a swordsman spending his life avenging his fathers murder, a grandfather (played perfectly by Peter Faulk) comforting his sick grandchild,and of course the power of 'true love'. Long live the dread pirate Roberts.",10,0,0,16 October 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," good but overrated
","First off I liked this movie. Visually intresting, good if unoriginal story, and fun. I rented it a couple days before Vol. 2 came out and I enjoyed it enough to see V2 on opening night. Here's my problem. If anyone but Quentin Tarantino made this film the critics would've killed it, but because it was done by him it was innovative, inspired, and original. The violence was cartoonish and fun which made the amount of fake blood spilled on screen easy to take. The story was a standard revenge flick filled with interesting over the top (Tarantino)scenes. I just find it funny that there seems to be a double standard for the critics, and Tarantino's treasure is another directors trash. Once again if you like revenge flicks styled after 70's kung fu and revenge movies you'll love it. I do recommend it.",7,0,3,17 June 2004
Pulp Fiction," had its moments
","This film had it's moments, and contained interesting scenes, but I just can't get behind a movie when I couldn't care less which characters live or die. You really have to look hard to find redeeming qualities in any of them. Bruce Willis' character was really the only one I cared even a little about.",4,8,19,11 October 2002
Army of Darkness," Gimmie some sugar baby
","The third and best Evil Dead movie. The first was scary as hell, the second was scary, gory, and funny, and this one is just plain awesome. You can't put this movie into any one, or even two genre's (horror, fantasy, adventure, comedy, action). Lets just call it great campy fun. The reason this all works is because of Bruce Campbells character Ash. Ash is simply too cool for his own good and you will just enjoy watching him in every situation. It may not be a classic in the usual sense of the word but for pure camp and fun it's in a class all it's own. Hail to the king baby!",10,2,3,27 October 2002
Sin City," overriding violence
","I loved the noir style, and visually the film is fantastic, groundbreaking, original, brilliant. The cast was top notch. Tough guys with a purpose, beautiful woman, often as tough as the men, and all seemed to play the character beautifully. However I didn't leave the theater thinking about how gorgeous the film was, but rather how violent. I understand Frank Millers graphic novels are very violent, and admire Rodriguez for staying true to the source, and I also don't particularly mind violence in movies. However I think if it was tuned down just a little it would've enhanced the film, rather then detract from it. See it for the tough guys, beautiful broads, and stunning visuals, but be prepared for the violence you'll find in Sin City.",5,4,9,4 April 2005
