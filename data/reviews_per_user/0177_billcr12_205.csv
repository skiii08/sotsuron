The Devil's Advocate," Awesome devil
","Forget 'The Excorcist,' a highly overrated thriller starring our friend with the pitchfork. 'The Devil's Advocate' is much more believable, having a law firm at the center of the story.Kevi n Lomax(Keanu Reeves) is a modern day Clarence Darrow, having never lost a case. Due to his great reputation, Kevin is hired by John Milton(Al Pacino) for trial work on extremely difficult cases for a huge amount of money.Of course, Kelvin's success leads to temptations which he will find harder and harder to resist. Al Pacino is at the top of his game, as evil a man as you 'll ever see and the premise of good versus evil and free will is showcased by great acting and a thoughtful script.",9,5,6,5 March 2012
The King's Speech," A perfect film

The Lobster," Strange Movie
","Lorgos Lanthimos does it once again; although not as wacked out as his previous oddity; Dogtooth, he still remains as different a filmmaker as anyone out there. Colin Farrell is David, a man looking for a wife in a futuristic society which requires everyone have a partner or suffer the consequence of being turned into an animal. David has chosen a lobster, because, as he explains, they live for one hundred years and are fertile throughout their lives. He also enjoys the ocean. Lanthimos' script is hilarious, giving Farrell the funniest moments of the film. The main setting is a resort hotel where strangers meet and are encouraged to hook up with others of similar tastes. among those are David, who is 'short sighted', a man who limps, a woman with constant nose bleeds and an assortment of other odd balls. It runs a bit long at almost two hours, but even so, The Lobster is worth the journey.",7,0,7,20 December 2015
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Sequel to Kill Bill
","Flashbacks are used to continue the story of the first Kill Bill with the bride(Uma Thurman is shown with Bill(David Carradine), her former lover and boss at the scene of her wedding, seeming to have Bill's blessings.We see Bill's past and training with a great martial arts master in his younger days. The bride must fight her way through many opponents in her pursuit of her former flame and mentor. She also finds her daughter along the way. Once again, as with the prior film, Tarantino always keeps things interesting.This is a worthy follow up to volume one and I await the last segment.",9,2,3,4 March 2012
Black Swan," Overrated and a whining Portman
","Natalie Portman whines her way through almost two hours of neurotic, delusional, and narcissistic behavior which somehow landed her an Academy Award. The golden statuette was misplaced; it was stolen from Halee Steinfeld, who was the heart and soul of True Grit. Back to the ridiculous saga of a ballerina, Nina(Portman), who lives with her overbearing mother, Erica(Barbara Hershey), a former dancer who controls her daughter like a puppet. Nina competes for the lead role in Swan Lake with Lily(Mila Kunis) who the director praises for being uninhibited, compared with the uptight Nina. She is told to loosen up by having sex, and so the frigid little princess goes home and masturbates. Later on, we are subjected to a tame and ridiculous lesbian scene with Portman and Kunis; and it heads downhill to its asinine ending.Director Darren Aronofsky is 0 for 2 in my book; The Wrestler being the other contrived nonsense.",5,8,14,1 May 2012
Changeling," Gripping Mystery

She comes home from work to discover that her nine year old son Walter, is missing. This starts a chain of events that are incredible.

Scarface," Pacino the bad guy
","Al Pacino is Tony Montana or scarface. He has escaped from Cuba to the United States as part of the freedom flotilla. He becomes involved in the cocaine trade in Miami, first on a small scale and then as a major distributor.A series of crooked policeman, bankers and politicians are all shown in realistic portrayals with no real heroes turning up to save the day. After extensive undercover law investigations, scarface must finally face the music. Director Brian De Palma, working with Oliver Stone's script produce a finale that allows Al Pacino to vent to the extreme. Only could Al get away with such a grandiose last act, but he makes the three hour running time worth it.",8,0,2,14 March 2012
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Funny satire
","Sasha Baron Cohen is a comic genius. Borat is as funny a movie as I have ever seen. He is so convincing as an innocent from Kazakhstan who no one uncovers as a sly, undercover Englishman, that I am still amazed at the temerity of this lunatic.The opening scene where Borat is introducing his sister as the #1 prostitute in Kazakhstan is so over the top that I still haven't stopped laughing. He is equally adept at skewering religion, nationalism, and racism. Pamela Anderson becomes a quest after an episode of 'Baywatch' on television. Our hero must find this perfect woman and marry her. The sequences that follow are brilliant, and Mr. Cohen risks his life frequently in this docudrama/comedy. Anyone who has had a really bad day should rent this hilarious film for a great escape from reality.",9,0,1,20 February 2012
10 Cloverfield Lane," Good Goodman
","John Goodman as you have never seen him before. A true believer in conspiracy theories ranging from Russian or Middle Eastern military attacks, to possible invasions from aliens from outer space; it is all here for your consideration. A woman, Michelle(Mary Elizabeth Winstead), leaves her husband and has a car accident, only to awaken in a concrete bunker, shackled to a bed with an i.v. line attached to her arm. Her captor/benefactor, Howard(Goodman), explains to her that America has been attacked by an unknown enemy and that he has saved her life. His bunker has air filters and plenty of stored food for a long stay until after the outside air has cleared enough to leave. Another tenant, Emmett, is another survivor, and together, the three pass the time watching movies and playing parlor games. This is pretty much a three character drama reminiscent of The Twilight Zone. The acting and script are good, but I was not thrilled with the ending. Even so, I would recommend 10 Cloverfield Lane as an above average sci-fi thriller.",7,1,4,15 May 2016
The Equalizer," Denzel is Great
","The one reason to watch The Equalizer is Denzel Washington. He is Bob, a seemingly ordinary man working at a Home Depot type of store. Every night at 2am he visits an all night diner to drink tea and read classic novels. Here he meets a young prostitute, played well by the always good Chloe Grace Moretz. Of course, bad things eventually happen to the girl. Her pimps are Russian Mafia guys are the personification of evil. Denzel to the rescue over the next two hours. The action is standard stuff, which we have seen before, but Denzel makes it worthwhile. A bit too long at two hours and twelve minutes, with typical villains, it is nevertheless entertaining enough to recommend as a good night's distraction. A 7.5/10.",Null,1,1,13 December 2014
Raiders of the Lost Ark," I was underwhelmed
","Steven Spielberg and George Lucas had the idea to recreate the Saturday morning serials of the 1940s with Raiders. Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones, a globe trotting adventurer looking for the Ark of the Covenant which would give Hitler the power to conquer world. Mr Ford always appears to be sleepwalking through his roles; somebody please wake him up. Robert Mitchum had a similar style, except Bob had charisma which is missing in Harrison.Indiana battles Nazis, fights off snakes, makes several great escapes and moves around enough to be awarded frequent flyer miles. Back and forth we go with the Ark, to the point where I did not care at all.One chapter was quite enough for me; I have no desire to suffer through the many sequels that followed.",2,6,23,5 April 2012
It," Too Long
","I have read about the first 20-25 books by Stephen King and the film adaptations run from the great Shawshank Redemption to the godawful Maximum Overdrive. It was made as a two part TV mini-series in 1990. After 27 years, I don't remember much about it. John Boy Walton and John Ritter were the stars, with Tim Curry as Pennywise the clown. Bill Skarsgard is the evil clown this time around, and he is the best thing in It. The kids are all the standard fat kid, the stutterer, the black kid, the Jewish kid, pretty much a predictable mix of 'losers' who are considered outsiders. Stand by Me had a similar concept but is a much better movie. It runs over two hours and I was ultimately bored. Pennywise is not given sufficient screen time and the boys and one girl are competent but pedestrian. The final scene hints at another chapter, and I may just skip that one.",5,0,1,20 December 2017
In Bruges," Hilarious
","I love this movie. Martin Mcdonagh is a genius who has written a brilliant script, equally as good as Fargo. Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell are hit men on the run and in hiding due to a screws up on their last killing. A scene with a priest and a confessional is worth the price of admission alone. Mcdonagh's sense of humor is wicked and the film gets stranger and stranger.Ray(Colin Farrell) has accidentally killed a boy and his Catholic guilt resonates with him, while his partner, Ken(Brendan Gleeson) is happy go lucky and the complete opposite of his brooding friend. After fighting with a Canadien couple and subsequent legal problems, they continue their colorful adventures in Brutes. Don't miss this one.",8,0,4,15 March 2012
John Wick," Good Action Movie
","Put your brain on hold and just sit back and relax for an hour and forty five minutes while Keanu Reaves finds a multitude of ways to kill many nasty people. The story is silly, but the action is continuous as Wick is pursued throughout by men and women with bad intentions. He is a karate expert and is also skilled with a variety of knives and firearms which are quite useful to our hero. His background is sketchy and never really explained but one must just suspend belief and just take the ride as if on a roller coaster. Willem Defoe shows up to fill out a decent cast with Reaves carrying most of the load, as he is in almost every scene. It looks good and the New York locations are a good choice. A final 7.5/10.",7,18,33,7 February 2015
Wind River," Wyoming Story
","Taylor Sheridan is an actor turned writer-director who last year put out the vastly overlooked Hell or High Water. It was my favorite film of 2016. The script deserved best picture and best screenplay at the Oscars. Wind River is not quite as good, but it is still an excellent movie. Jeremy Renner plays a wildlife agent whose main job is to keep coyotes from decimating herds of sheep. While on the prowl in search of a marauding mountain lion, he comes upon a dead eighteen year-old girl from the town. She is face down in the snow with blood coming out of her mouth. The FBI is summoned to the Wind River Indian Reservation to help the understaffed local police solve the crime. Elizabeth Olsen is the agent and she joins Renner in the search for the killer. Along the way, they encounter drug addicts and other colorful but depressing people. Renner's ex-wife is Indian and they have a boy together. It turns out that their high school aged daughter had a bad experience with a criminal element and this pretty much rounds out the story. The scenery of Wyoming and Utah are spectacular and the script is precise with some good, witty moments. So far for 2017, Get Out and Wind River are two best films.",8,1,3,5 October 2017
The Death of Stalin," Great
",Where is the publicity for this great movie. Steve Buscemi is Nikita Kruschev and a mostly English cast make it an awesome ensemble. Stalin becomes disabled by a stroke and the Russian cabinet battle for the leadership role in 1953. It is a black comedy in the vein of the Coen brothers. The script is brilliant and The Death of Stalin is one of the best films of the year. I lover The Shape of Water but this is even better. 7.2 is much to low a rating on IMDB. Rotten Tomatoes has a 100% rating.,9,0,3,20 June 2018
Se7en," Great crime thriller
","The seven deadly sins are used as a motive for a serial killer being tracked down by detectives Somerset(Morgan Freeman) and Mills(Brad Pitt). The first victim killed is an obese man who represents gluttony. A wealthy attorney found dead is greed. Lust is an obvious choice, a prostitute murdered and raped. A beautiful model whose face has been slashed dies, pride is her great sin and all of the Catholic big seven are covered by the end of this very well written and thoughtful analysis of a sick mind.Freeman and Pitt make a great pair, and Kevin Spacey is creepy as John Doe, the suspect. There is no easy solution and the ending is one of the best I've ever seen.",9,1,2,1 March 2012
I'm Not There," Disjointed mess
","First and foremost, Bob Dylan is a genius and a perfect subject for interpretation. A great idea with mixed results in I'm Not There. Cate Blanchett opens as Jude Quinn, a mid 1960s era Dylan getting on stage but quickly shown in a motorcycle accident. The British actress looks uncannily like the folk singer, especially in silhouette. Marcus Carl Franklin portrays Woody Guthrie and the eleven year old boy proves to be a major talent. He travels the country by train and in a time shift travels to a hospital to perform a song for the real Woody Guthrie. Christian Bale is in a documentary style portion as fans praise the great artist as the voice of a generation as he treats and reporters with contempt. Bobby does not come off to well as a human being.Later on, Bale reappears as a born again pastor, which showcases Dylan's brief Christian period , preaching to a congregation and singing the gospel tune 'Pressing On' from the album 'Saved.'Heath Ledger is in a film within the film as an actor playing the Christian Bale character in the least interesting part of I'm Not There. The second unnecessary segment is Richard Gere as Billy the Kid looking for his dog and meeting Pat Garrett and a convoluted storyline with a funeral, a jail break and back to the train once again. I found the whole experience a disjointed mess with some fine acting. I love Dylan's work, so this is a wasted effort.",5,10,10,25 April 2012
The Big Lebowski," Major disappointment
","I am in shock that the Coen brothers, who are responsible for Fargo, one of my ten best, could have written such a sophomoric waste of talent, most especially Jeff Bridges who is given the wonderful words, hey man and hey dude, over and over. It is as if Beavis and Butt head have turned from cartoon figures to real flesh and blood. Bridges is the dude, who has been mistaken for a rich guy with the same name. The wealthy mans wife is kidnapped and the dude is drafted to be the go between for the ransom payoff for her safe return. The dude smokes loads of pot, drinks heavily and enjoys bowling on a regular basis. His best friend is Walter, played by John Goodman as a Gulf War veteran with a violent temper. Steve Buscemi completes the triad and all three have never had so little to work with. What a huge disappointment from the usually reliable brothers.",1,27,60,5 April 2012
Citizen Kane," Welles best
","Orson Welles has been called a one hit wonder for directing, co-writing, and starring in Citizen Kane. The story is a thinly disguised biography of William Randolph Hearst, the newspaper publisher. Charles Foster Kane(Welles) lives as a recluse on an estate. He dies while lying in bed and his last word is rosebud. The media spend the rest of the movie trying to find out the meaning of the word.The investigation is shown through a series of flashbacks and interviews with his second wife, his butler and a journal written by his childhood guardian who has passed away. The research uncovers a poor early upbringing, living in a boarding house run by his parents. After gold is discovered on the property, they go from rags to riches. Kane's life is a combination of great wealth accompanied by an equal amount of pain and sorrow with divorces, suicides, alcoholism, adultery and other asserted woes.All of the troubles occur during his rise to power as a media tycoon who manipulates public opinion mostly through a underhanded newspaper. We finally are told the meaning of rosebud at the end. I was not overwhelmed by the supposed greatest movie ever made.",7,0,1,28 March 2012
Monster," Oh My
","Charlie Theron won the best actress Oscar portraying Aileen Wuornos in this true life crime drama. Christina Ricci is Selby, her lesbian soul mate. The movie is more of a love story than the usual serial killer thriller we are used to seeing. Theron is so good that I felt as if I was watching a documentary. Ricci is also quite good as the clueless love interest Selby. The violence is there, but not overwhelming, and in the end, we have no one and nothing to root for, but Theron and the underrated Ricci make Monster well worth watching. The makeup artist makes Theron look almost exactly like the tough looking Wuornos and I rate the film an 8/10.",8,0,0,12 April 2015
Inglourious Basterds," A Wild Ride
","Inglorious Basterds might be Quentin Tarantino's most complicated story line yet. World War II is the setting and it opens at at a French farmhouse where the owner is suspected of hiding Jews. He is interrogated by a Nazi Colonel Hans Landa; played by Christoph Waltz in an Oscar winning performance both chilling and hilarious at the same time. After denials, a hidden family is given up and one, Shosanna, escapes. Brad Pitt is Lieutenant Aldo Raine, and his mission is to recruit eight Jewish-American soldiers to sneak behind enemy lines and kill as many Germans as possible. He requests 100 scalps as trophies from each man. Pitt is over the top in an almost comic book fashion, but this is Tarantino's baby. In the meantime, Shosanna has become a French woman named Emmanuelle who owns a movie theater in Paris. She meets Zoller, a German hero who is the subject of a Lenin Riefenstal type of propaganda film and he introduces her to Joseph Goebbels and she offers her theater for the premiere of the movie, with the plan to assemble as many higher ups as possible in order to kill them in retaliation for the massacre of her family. The last chapter is classic Tarantino, a complete fantasy with the Nazi's looking like Hogan's Heroes. Revenge is sweet and so is Inglorious Basterds.",9,2,7,11 April 2012
Au Revoir les Enfants," Malle's Great Film
","Goodye Children is the Engilsh translation of the title and director Louie Malle has created one of the best World War II dramas ever made. It is based on his childhood memories at a Catholic boarding school.Julien is a spoiled rich kid who is introduced to three new students, one of them, Jean, is very quiet, and his fellow classmates shun him. One night, Julien wakes up and sees Jean praying while wearing a yarmulke. It turns out that the school is hiding Jewish kids from the Nazis. The two slowly become friends, and when Julien's parents visit they bring Jean with them to a high class restaurant where German officers are dining. A patron is expelled during an ugly racist argument.A cook at the school is caught stealing food and selling it on the black market. In order to save himself he informs the Gestapo of the presence of Jewish hideaways and Jean is taken away. The priest in charge was also put in a camp by the Germans. The final part of the film is devastating and Malle has done the true story a great justice by this work.",9,1,2,9 May 2012
Shaun of the Dead," Boring
","George Romero directed the classic Dawn of the Dead in 1979; eleven years after his classic, Night of the Living Dead. Shaun of the Dead is a parody of Romero's horror film. Shaun hangs out in a pub every night and breaks up with his girlfriend. Along the way, he also fights with his mother and stepfather.Whlie suffering from a hangover, he and his friends are attacked by zombies. The violence is typical and the comedy repetitive and tiresome. I do not understand the 8/10 rating on IMDb. I usually am a fan of British humor; but not this time. I would recommend Zombieland as an alternative. It is far superior movie with an outstanding performance by Woody Harrelson.",3,1,4,18 August 2013
Hostel," Eli's debut
","Director-writer Eli Roth should return to his old job guarding Howard Stern's trailer while the king of all media slept during breaks while making the film private parts. He should have paid attention to Betty Thomas and Ivan Reitman and maybe he would have learned something about film making.Hostel is a poorly written and badly acted amateurish debut by the former trailer watcher who has not impressed me with this opening effort.Three college students are traveling across Europe and find a hostel to stay at cheaply. They meet two beautiful women who invite them out to dance. One of the kids disappears and a photo of his severed head appears on a cell phone. Next up we are treated to handcuffs, mutilations and every form of fun imaginable. There was no need for a sequel; one hostel is quite enough.",5,0,1,3 April 2012
Us," Major Plot Holes
",I loved Get Out. Us is a major disappointment from the same writer-director Jordan Peele. A family on vacation near a lake house meet some sort of body doubles who seem to be taken from Invasion of the Body Snatchers. The film meanders along and the plot holes are enormous. Lupita Nyongo is excellent in the lead but the material is well below her talent. the husband and children are also very good but the two hours just drag on and on. The script lacks the great comedic moments of Peele's Get Out which had much more depth than this overlong film. I hope that Mr. Peele picks up the story of Get Out and makes a sequel. This is a big letdown.,4,1,2,13 June 2019
Ted," Wahlberg and Kunis are Good
","Ted is a teddy bear, given to a lonely eight year old boy for Christmas, who wishes for the stuffed animal to be real. Well, his wish comes true when Ted begins to have human like conversations with the kid. Word spreads and Ted becomes famous. Fame is fleeting, and as we flash forward to the now thirty five year old John Bennett, who has remained best friends with the pot smoking, foul mouthed bear, the film becomes a fairly routine romantic comedy. Mila Kunis is Lori, John's girlfriend of four years, who has grown tired of John and Ted's sophomoric and immature antics. She demands that he drop the sarcastic childhood toy and commit to her fully. The predictable breakup occurs, and a few mildly amusing scenes are used as filler, including a funny one with the actor Sam Jones from the campy 'Flash Gordon' movie from yesteryear. Mark Wahlberg is easy going and he has good chemistry with Kunis on screen. The script is decent, but nothing new or different, other than the concept of a talking teddy bear. I give it a 7/10.",7,0,3,17 November 2012
Oldboy," Creative
","Korea has been releasing some very interesting films over the past ten years, and Oldboy is no exception. Oh Dae-su has been mysteriously trapped in a room for fifteen years. Earler clues show him being bailed out of a police station by a friend after a fight while drunk. He is kidnapped and held hostage in a hotel room and fed dumplings through a slot in the door. A television is kept on, which broadcasts reports on his family. His wife has been killed and daughter given to foster parents.The Kafkaesque nightmare continues when he is framed for his wife's death. When he attempts suicide, a sedative is gassed into the room to put him to sleep. In Shawshank fashion, he digs a hole in the wall to escape. Suddenly, he wakes up on the roof, dressed in a suit. He is given a cellphone and goes to a restaurant and meets a chef, Mi-do, who takes him home. She gives him an instant message from his captor. Woo-jin finally admits to being the abductor, and tells Oh that if he can figure out the motive for his troubles, Woo will kill himself; if not he will kill Mi-do. The plot becomes complicated, as we learn of an incestuous relationship and a suicide. Oldboy looks like a cross between Alfred Hitchcock and David Lynch. It is a stylish thriller and never boring. I was impressed.",8,1,4,20 July 2012
Spider-Man 2," More spidey
","Spider man 2 continues the adventures of Peter Parker and his alter ego spider man, the crime fighting super hero. Tobey Maguire is back again as is his love interest, Mary Jane(Kirsten Dunst). The high octane action is as thrilling as the first film and the main villain is Dr. Octavius(Alfred Molina) who has created a mechanical device with giant metal tentacles with which he terrorizes the city.Dr. Octavius works on a fusion machine which will enable him to take over the world and spidey must stop him before he achieves his goal. Meanwhile, due to his hectic schedule battling bad guys, Mary Jane has become engaged to someone else, breaking the web man's heart. Predictably, our hero will fight for his woman, and he does.

A retired federal agent named Benjamin Esposito is writing a novel based on a criminal case that his office investigated years earlier. He visits a former employee who is now a judge, Irene Menendez, and they dig further into the old rape murder crime.

This leads to a very interesting conclusion which worked for me.",8,2,3,12 April 2012
The Great Dictator," Chaplin's genius
","Charlie Chaplin made the great dictator in 1940. In it he plays a megalomaniac intent on taking over the world; wonder who that might be? The little tramp wears a very familiar mustache, making him look like Adolf Hitler.Chaplin plays both a Jewish barber at the beginning and then a dictator named Adenoid Hynkel later on. The leader gives a rallying speech in pure gibberish, Chaplin studied Hitler's voice for real and does a vicious impression, gesticulating like the lunatic Nazi and portraying him for the fool that he was.Only could a genius take such a tragic and harrowing story and make a searing and funny satire. Chaplin has done it with style and grace.",8,2,4,21 March 2012
Ed Wood," Johnny Depp is hilarious
","Johnny Depp is hilarious as the 1950's camp underground film director, Ed Wood. A biography was to be made about Christine Jorgensen, the first male to female sex change operation ever done. because no rights could be obtained, Wood, who was a transvestite, convinced producers to let him make a fictionalized version of the story. The result was his first of many failures, 'Glen or Glenda.' Wood's next project is a low, low budget monster move. He convinces an aging and drug addicted Bela Lugosi, the original Dracula, to be the leading man. Martin Landau won the 1994 Academy Award for his blistering performance. Wood makes a huge mistake by bringing up Boris Karloff and Frankenstein, which sets off Lugosi on a maniacal tirade that is so over the top and hysterical and the scene which sealed the Oscar for Landau.The final and most infamous release was 'Plan 9 From Outer Space,' which pretty much sealed Wood's fate as the worst film maker in history and fortunately for us gave us this great biopic.",9,0,0,6 March 2012
Spotlight," Excellent Movie
","Spotlight takes on the story of the Catholic Church's cover up of pedophile priests in Boston in 2001. A new editor, Marty Baron(Liev Schreiber), hears of what looks at first to be a small news item of a priest molesting a young boy, and decides to have the Boston Globe's Spotlight team dig deeper to see if there is a bigger story to be uncovered. Robby Robinson(Michael Keaton) leads the team of journalists in the investigation which uncovers the now well known scandal of Cardinal Law and other leaders of the church ignoring the exploding criminal activities of a shockingly large number of priests being protected and moved from parish to parish. Spotlight focuses mainly on the dogged pursuit by the hard working reporters who keep on despite the atmosphere of intimidation of the Archdiocese of Boston. Director Tom McCarthy keeps the film moving and has an excellent cast led by Michael Keaton, who is ably supported by Rachel McAdams and Mark Ruffalo as fellow Globe reporters. One of the best movies of 2015.",9,1,2,10 January 2016
Deadpool 2," Entertaining
","Ryan Reynolds is back as Deadpool and it is pretty much a repeat of the first film. Everyone wants revenge and for two hours you get what you pay for. Josh Brolin is the chief villain as Cable and he is good as ever. The cast of misfits is colorful and the action is nonstop. Reynolds has the charisma necessary to carry the pedestrian story line. This ain't Hamlet, so do not go in with expectations of high art, but it is a good way to kill a couple of hours.",7,0,2,8 August 2018
X-Men," Halle's blonde phase
","Another Marvel comic book superhero adventure movie with an interesting and diverse cast. My personal favorite is Halle Berry in a platinum blonde wig. She is Storm with the unique ability to control the weather. Nothing special about the character but Halls looks awesome, as usual.Rogue(Anna Paquin) is fooling around with her boyfriend and when she kisses him, he is knocked out. She discover that anyone she touches transfers their strength and memories to her.Ian McKellen is magneto and he is a walking powerful magnet with scientific abilities regarding genetics. He is also a survivor of World War 2.Hugh Jackman is Wolverine, a tough fighter with claws, animal senses and rapid healing powers.Patrick Stuart is professor Charles Xavier who runs a school for the gifted and although confined to a wheelchair, he has unusual mental telepathic senses.There are several other crew with various super powers and they get to showcase them throughout some very well choreographed battles with bad guys; oh, and did I mention that Halle Berry looks great in a platinum blonde wig; please forgive me my obsession with her. X-Men is not as good as Spiderman but it is entertaining.",7,0,1,26 March 2012
Spider-Man 3," Too much Dunst
","Spiderman 3 continues the high action formula of the first two. The problem is Raimi's script which drags on for almost 2 1/2 hours. Early on, Peter Parker is watching his girlfriend, Mary Jane Watson on stage singing some God awful musical number and being close to tears over her performance. I was ready to strangle Mary Jane. Her part, played by an extremely annoying Kirsten Dunst pretty much ruins this third chapter of Spidey's adventures.Now the good, starting with a cool villain called the sandman, Thomas Haden Church, whose shape shifting ability is a fun device.Willem Dafoe is back as the green goblin, and his son Harry(James Franco) also returns as the new goblin and both actors are excellent. Spidey 3 is too much Dunst who brings the whole thing down, I hope Raimi has the good sense to shrink her screen time for number 4.",7,0,0,26 March 2012

He finds Nikola Tesla(David Bowie)and has him build a real transportation machine. Thomas Edison sends some people to burn the lab, and Tesla warns Angier to destroy the device. Of course, the inventor is ignored, and this leads us to a big surprise ending, which worked for me. Nolan uses beautiful sets with intricate tricks and excellent acting, all around. The Prestige is a top notch mystery.",8,0,1,10 July 2012
The Terminator," Arnold rules
","Arnold Schwartzenegger is the terminator, a cyborg sent to kill Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton). The science fiction element is time travel with Arnie attempting to change the future by eliminating the mother of a leader of a resistance force against evil machines wishing to take over the world. James Cameron lets the full throttle action tell the story as the terminator has very few lines of dialog. Most of plot is constant car and motorcycle chases and large explosions, but hey this ain't Shakespeare, so just grab some popcorn, sit back and wait for the immortal 'I'll be Back,' delivered with such dead pan force by Schwarzenegger that I have to admit that the terminator is definitely a guilty pleasure.",8,1,1,15 March 2012

The Hateful Eight," Long but Entertaining
","The three hour running time is a bit much, but every shot is interesting in this marathon of a western. Quentin Tarantino uses his usual sarcastic language throughout, giving a great cast, led by Samuel L. Jackson great lines to spew out with sneering venom at each other. Jackson and Jennifer Jason Leigh are particular standouts, and Kurt Russell, Michael Madsen, Tim Roth and Bruce Dern make for the ensemble who shine brightly, and viciously reading Tarantino's badass vernacular which we have heard before. The story is the basic western one, with influences from Bonanza on the small screen to Sergio Leone's from the big screen; particularly 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly; Tarantino's favorite movie. Major Warren hitches a ride with John Ruth(Russell) who is handcuffed to his $10,000 bounty, Daisy(Leigh), on their way to Red Rock and payment for delivery to the hangman. A blizzard forces them to stop at Minnie's Haberdashery, where the eight come together for intrigue and a bloody finale very similar to 'Reservoir Dog's', Tarantino's directorial debut from 1993. The Hateful Eight is one of the best movies of 2015.",9,9,31,27 December 2015
Crash," Multi layered drama
","Crash confronts the racism that is within all of us, whether we admit it or not. It begins with Asian women screaming racial insults at each other at a traffic incident. Next up is Middle Eastern people in an argument at which a man buys a gun. The third scene is a car jacking of a white district attorney an his wife by two black men. The d.a.' s wife is later having the locks changed in their house when she makes racist remarks about the Latino locksmith. A pair of white police officers pull over a black husband and wife and frisk them aggressively, even to the point of sexual harassment of the wife.

Snatch," Pitt is hilarious
","Brad Pitt can really be funny. He is a bare knuckled Irish boxer Mickey O'Neil and he nails the brogue so well that I was convinced that he was from the Emerald Isle. Unlike his ex-wife Madonna, Guy Ritchie actually has talent. He directs Snatch in a non linear fashion and with enough off beat dialogue to invite comparisons to Quentin Tarantino. Benicio del Toro is jewel thief Frankie four fingers and he is in London to sell a huge diamond that he has stolen. He gets double crossed by gangsters who run a dog fighting ring and expand into boxing. Mickey winds up fighting for them and when they lose money due to the Irishman not taking a fall, all hell breaks loose. Several kidnappings, killings and every crime known to man soon follow as Snatch becomes a full fledged, violent ride with a satisfying conclusion.",9,0,3,11 April 2012

A black undercover cop first infiltrates the Black Panthers at a lecture by Stokely Carmichael. He then takes the initiative to contact the KKK by phone, posing as a white man. He uses a fellow officer to meet face to face with the racists. Historical footage, from the high school at Little Rock to scenes from Birth of a Nation are used.

Pan's Labyrinth," a beautiful, stunning masterpiece
","There is no other word but masterpiece do describe this film from writer-director Guillermo Del Toro. The imagery is nothing short of breathtaking, and he has made a major discovery with the young actress, Ivana Baquero, who commands the screen for a majority of the two hour running time. It is 1944, in Franco's Spain, during the time of civil unrest. A combination of history and fantasy, blended so seamlessly that I was completely lost in Ofelia's adolescent world of woe. We meet her on the road, traveling with her mother, Carmen(Ariadna Gil), where they stop for a moment, and Ofelia spots a strange, winged insect which she follows to a hole in a tree. It trails the car to a compound where she meets her new stepfather, Vidal(Sergi Lopez), a Captain in the fascist army, fighting guerrillas hiding in the nearby mountains. Carmen is pregnant and a widow who has chosen a loveless marriage to an evil man in order to provide for her children. The insect leads Ofelia to a tree with a labyrinth inside and she is introduced to a faun(a tall et like creature, played by Doug Jones, the one American in the cast who was taught Spanish line by line). He is her teacher and guide to the underworld. He gives her three tasks to perform before the full moon; the first task is removing a key from a giant toad; the second being the retrieval of a knife from a lair, and the third, a daunting task with her new baby brother. She must complete the three missions in order to become Princess Moanna, the queen of the underworld. The story is compelling and the acting tremendous, from Baquero to Sergi Lopez's scowling villain, Captain Vidal, there is nothing to criticize in Pan's Labyrinth and I give it a 10/10.",10,2,5,18 February 2008

He ends up taking shelter in a Catholic Church, which is a neutral zone during the war. A group of schoolgirls is already living there. Within a short period of time, several prostitutes arrive at the church to hide from the rampaging soldiers.Bale is great in the lead, as always, as commanding a presence as any actor working today and his female counterpart, newcomer Ni Ni, is someone to watch out for, she is beautiful and has a star quality that is undeniable. Although it runs well over two hours, I never lost interest and I really cared about what happened to the victims of this sad part of history.

The Way Back," A Great Adventure
","The book is a can't put it down page turner which has been faithfully adapted to the big screen. A Polish prisoner of war who was imprisoned at a Soviet gulag in Siberia wrote the original journal which became an international best seller in the 1950s. Director Peter Weir has done a fine job in retaining the feel of the book, The Long Walk.The lead, Janusz, is placed in the camp in 1939 and meets an American, Mr. Smith(Ed Harris), an actor, Khabarov, Valka(Colin Farrell), the only real criminal, along with a cook, a priest, and an accountant. They put together a plan to travel south to Mongolia, passing Lake Baikal. The escape begins on the night of a blizzard and one of the men gets lost and is found frozen to death. The trek is a dangerous and deadly one, knocking them off one after the other. A young Polish girl, Irena, meets them along the way telling the tale of her parent's murder by Russian soldiers and her harrowing escape. She later admits that her mother and father were actually arrested as spies. The group encounter a sandstorm, suffer starvation and dehydration and some of them finally reach the Himalayas with Nepal and India within sight. Weir chose a first rate cast, my favorite being Colin Farrell as the unscrupulous criminal Valka, who provides some much needed comic relief.

They are forced to sell it and head for Canada and a new life. The ship encounters a vicious storm and sinks. Pi manages to crawl on to a lifeboat and is followed by a Bengal tiger. The story is a bit far fetched but it makes for a roller coaster ride of a movie. The scenery is spectacular and Suraj Sharma is up to the task as Pi, mostly playing opposite the majestic tiger. It flashes back and forth between Pi as the adult telling the story to a writer and the teenager on the boat and I was not thrilled with the ending but overall, even though a bit overlong at two hours and seven minutes, it is one of the better films of 2012 and worthy of an 8/10.",8,0,1,19 January 2013

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Dark Comedy
","Martin McDonagh hits another home run with Three Billboards. In Bruges was one of my ten best in 2008. He also produced The Guard, one my best of 2011. He has made the transition from writing plays in Ireland, to somehow having the ear to write dialogue for American actors. Frances McDormand is the star here, and she should be preparing her acceptance speech for the upcoming Academy Awards. She is Mildred Hayes, a divorced mother whose teen daughter has been raped and murdered on the side of a desolate road. The slow moving, Mayberry like police department is not exactly Scotland Yard. Mildred has the inspiration to rent three billboards with the messages of raped while dying, still no arrests, and how come Chief Willoughby? The chief is played by Woody Harrelson, and he matches McDormand scene for scene. The film is violent, funny and has a deep, dark cynicism throughout. McDonagh shares a verbal style similar to Quentin Tarantino, my other current favorite filmmaker. It is amazing what can be done with a relatively small ($12 million) budget. It was money well spent.",8,1,5,28 December 2017
The Grapes of Wrath," Steinbeck classic
","Starting with John Steinbeck's classic novel of the Depression and migration of families from Texas and Oklahoma due to the dust bowl and subsequent drought, the grapes of wrath brings the pain and suffering of the farmers to the big screen. Huge numbers of migrants had the misfortune of living through both the stock market crash and its aftermath and the lack of rain which left thousands of empty farms.Narrated by Tom Joad, a man who has just been released from prison and returns to the family farm only to find it abandoned. He meets up with a former preacher, Jim Casey, and they venture out on the road. What they find is not pretty as the banks have foreclosed on countless properties and the rumor spreads that California is a perfect destination for good, high paying jobs. Unfortunately, the employers have sent out many more fliers than people needed for the work and use the oversupply to keep wages low. In order to force a living wage, attempts are made to form unions , which results in violence between starving transients living in camps and the owners who call them reds or communists.The book is one of the finest works of American literature and director John Ford retains the spirit of the novel using Henry Fonda as every man in the defining character, Tom Joad. John Carradine is also well cast as the doubting former preacher, Jim Casey. The mood is ominous but at the same time hopeful of a better time yet to come. We need to be reminded of our past mistakes in order to avoid repeating them, and this film is a good history lesson.",8,0,1,22 March 2012

","Bradley Cooper stars as Chris Kyle, the most prolific sniper in American military history. It begins with the thirty year old Kyle as a cowboy type who is searching for meaning in his life when he becomes a navy seal. After rigorous training he is sent to Iraq and becomes a legendary sniper. The war scenes look very similar to Stanley Kubrick's often used ones in Full Metal Jacket. The camera tracks from behind the soldiers as they move forward. The action is fast paced and well done by director Clint Eastwood. The melodramatic family moments are fairly typical, with the suffering wife holding the home front while hubby keeps the world safe for democracy. I found Sierra Miller annoying as Kyle's spouse, but Cooper was cast right in the lead role. Although a bit too long at two hours and fifteen minutes, it is still one of the better films of 2014.",7,64,132,10 January 2015

It begins with the little boy riding a train to Calcutta and winding up at a prison like shelter surrounded by other orphans. Saroo (Patel), as the child, has the good luck of being adopted by a loving Australian couple. Nicole Kidman is excellent as his mother and Rooney Mara is also good as his American girlfriend. The story is heart wrenching with a cast that includes a few very young kids who are nothing short of amazing. Lion may well be the best film of 2016.",9,0,1,1 February 2017
The Passion of Joan of Arc," Haunting Portrayal
","A fairly well known religious story, French director Carl Theodor Dreyer made The Passion of Joan of Arc in 1928. Because it is silent and in black and white, facial expressions via frequent close ups must convey the sincerity of the subject. Whether she was insane and delusional or was actually hearing the voice of God is up to the viewer to decide. I have to separate my personal views as a retired Catholic from my review. Joan is played magnificently by Renee Jeanne Falconetti, who so convincingly portrays the future saints' emotional character so well. Her performance has been hailed by many as one of the best ever captured on film. The transcript of her trial is used as the basis, with judges on a panel interrogating Joan and doubting her message from above, to drive the English from France. Even under torture, she never relents, and it is not a spoiler to mention the burning at the stake, which is not a secret. The Passion of Joan of Arc is a work of art, regardless of ones beliefs about the supernatural. Ms. Falconetti's last role is a memorable one, which should be studied by everyone in the acting profession for a lesson in perfection.",8,2,4,4 June 2012

Things get complicated when a child molester is found and the police uncover the previous kidnapping of Amanda is not what it seemed. Morgan Freeman turns up as a retired police captain who is a good man trying to make a difference. Tough choices must be made, and they lead to one of the best endings I've ever seen. Dennis Lehane's novels translate well to the big screen; Mystic River is another excellent movie. I highly recommend both.",9,0,1,14 August 2012

O.k., nothing original as far as the story goes, but this is based on a Marvel comics book, not Shakespeare.

He arranges the kidnapping of his wife by a couple of low life's headed by the super creepy Steve Bescemi in his most evil role. Jerry has the idea of having his father in law pay the ransom for his daughter. The best laid plans of mice and men soon go awry and what follows is part keystone cops and part Greek tragedy.

They develop a relationship which is advantageous to both. He gets better and better at shooting graphic footage for Russo to use on air. They are both completely amoral, and by the end of this film you despise the both of them. Jake's Lou is an extremely quirky character who spouts strange pearls of wisdom throughout. Russo is just as vicious, and will do anything necessary to survive. Nightcrawler is one of the ten best movies of 2014.",8,1,2,6 December 2014
The Aviator," Scorcese's Epic
","Martin Scorsese delivers an almost three hour epic masterpiece with Leonardo Dicaprio becoming Howard Hughes, with all of his strange behavior, often funny but also tragic. The obsessive compulsive germ phobia manifested by Hughes was rooted in lectures by his mother in his early childhood. Even with all his bizarre behavior, Hughes was a great visionary, both in aeronautics and the early days of the film industry. Genius and insanity often go hand in hand as was the case in Hughes life. In spite of his mental problems, Hughes managed to build 'The Spruce Goose' a wooden airplane which was the largest aircraft ever built in the 1940s. He was truly a man ahead of his time. His movie company enabled him to date many of early Hollywood's leading ladies. Kate Beckinsale shines as Ava Gardner, the one true love of his life. Gardner was the one person without an ulterior motive in Hughes life and the great British actress portraying her really delivers here.Even with the length of this biography, the story is compelling from beginning to end and is a triumph of film making by Scorsese.",10,0,1,21 February 2012

Cleaner is the term used for a hit man and the premise of this movie is Reno training Portman how to kill efficiently without getting caught in the process.Nathalie(Portman) is a 12 year old girl who has witnessed the execution of her mother and father and is then instantly orphaned. Reno ends up taking her in and helping her avenge her parents deaths. What follows is heart stopping action and a tender love story which never crosses the line into pedophilia. The chemistry between Reno and Portman is magical and Gary Oldman is the perfect villain. I was just blown away by this thriller.,10,4,6,21 February 2012
Baby Driver," Baby Driver is One LOUD Movie
","This may be the loudest soundtrack in the history of movies. Baby is a getaway driver who suffers from a hearing problem and must constantly listen to music through an IPOD to distract the ringing in his ears. It opens with a bank robbery and police chase as Baby manages to lose the law in a Subaru STI. They picked the right car, as I had the opportunity to drive one a few years ago and was a blast. I only had it up to 115 MPH. Newcomer Ansel Elgort is excellent in the lead role and the supporting cast, including an uncredited Jamie Foxx are very good. The chase scenes are typical Hollywood stuff, but the script has plenty of humor, with Kevin Spacey given the best lines as a ruthless crime boss. So far it has not been a good year, but this film is on my early 10 best list along with Get Out, Wind River and War for the Planet of the Apes. I hope for more to add in the last two months of 2017.",8,0,2,2 November 2017

The Revenant," Beautiful but Long
","Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Hugh Glass, a fur trapper, who in the 1820s, was part of a fur trapping expedition, who was attacked by a grizzly bear and left for dead by his companions. His major rival, John Fitzgerald, portrayed by the great British actor Tom Hardy, using a dead on Texas accent, make The Revenant one of the best films of 2015. The scenery is awesome and the story a compelling one. My only criticism is that at over two and a half hours, it is a little too long. The director, Alejandro Inarritu, could have tightened up the editing a bit and still had an excellent movie. Even so, The Revenant is worth watching.",8,1,5,3 January 2016
Split," Mcavoy is Great
","James McAvoy is the only reason to watch Split. He is a man with 23 separate and distinct personalities. Three high school girls are abducted from a parking lot in a Pennsylvania town. Kevin(McAvoy) has placed them in a room and appears as a different person with each encounter, including one as a little boy. He also is a regular patient of a college professor, Dr. Fletcher(Betty Buckley), who not only treats him as a client, but uses him in lectures as an example of an extreme multiple personality disorder. The three victims are downright silly and the doctor clueless as to just how dangerous her pet project is to society. His means of financial support are never explained and how he is able to survive and live in some abandoned building with no one seeing him come and go is absurd. M. Night Shyamalan has left too many gaping plot holes here. He uses a flashback involving one of the girls as a small child in the woods with her father and uncle hunting deer. It makes no sense as to the rest of the story. McAvoy is riveting as he transitions from one personality to the next with both voice and body mannerisms that are uncanny. I was impressed with him previously in another movie from Scotland in 2013 which is fairly unknown, Filth. He is hilarious as a corrupt policeman and it is a better film then Split.",7,5,16,29 March 2017

In a world filled with cynical adults, seven year old Olive(Breslin), convinces her family to take a long road trip in their VW mini bus on a long journey to a little miss sunshine contest.We then meet the eccentric relatives including Olive's gay uncle Frank, a gay scholar specializing in Proust. Frank's recent suicide attempt has him living with the family. Olive's best friend is her grandfather Edwin(Alan Arkin) who has been evicted from a senior's home for drug use and cannot stop cursing. Her brother has decided to stop speaking completely and remains silent on the drive.Olive never gives up on her dream to compete in the beauty contest and the traveling family turns into a warped Disney version of 'on the road.'

The Shining," King meets Kubrick
","Stephen King wrote the Shining intending for the main character, Jack, to be a completely normal man with a wife and son who is hired to be the caretaker for the closed Overlook hotel for the winter. The hotel causes him to slowly lose his marbles. Therein, lies the problem. Jack Nicholson is McMurphy from One flew over the cuckoo's nest the instant he appears on screen. The same wicked smile and look of someone not quite all there in the head. Kubrick chose the wrong actor this time. Jack hears the legend of the previous guy who watched over the hotel and went postal and killed his entire family. He does not believe it. His wife, Wendy(Shelley Duvall) and son Danny(Danny Lloyd) arrive and a black cook, Dick(Scatman Crothers) is able to communicate with the little boy telepathically. He explains to Danny that he has always had this ability and calls it the shining. He warns the kid to stay out of room 237. Of course, curiosity will cause him to check out room and he sees a dead woman there but keeps it to himself. The visual highlight is a large and intricate hedge, beautifully landscaped into a maze where Danny and his mother explore.Meanwhile, Jack suffers from writers block, typing over and over, all work and no play make Jack a dull boy; the author is clearly losing it. King used his own periodical droughts as inspiration for this element. Danny continues to have visions of doom and frantically writes redrum on a mirror while daddy dearest transforms into Paul Bunyan/Ed Mcmahon, and swings an axe at a door barricading his wife while screaming, 'here's Johnny,' a typical family dispute.Danny uses his esp to send an sos to Dick the cook and you will have to watch the movie to find out how it ends.",7,0,1,26 March 2012

U.S. army Captain Willard(Martin Sheen) is sent to Saigon on a covert operation to find Colonial Kurtz(Brando)who is not following military orders from his commanders. Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore(Robert Duvall in his most Manic role~I love the smell of napalm in the morning) leads air attack helicopters in breathtaking sequences of both beauty and horror.This needs to be seen on a big screen to appreciate the incredible cinematography with visuals that overwhelm the senses. One slight criticism is a slow middle with Playboy bunnies on a USO tour which is expanded in uncut version of the film. Overall, it's is still a great movie.",9,1,2,2 March 2012
Edward Scissorhands," Magical Burton
","Tim Burton creates interesting fantasy worlds, which are unique and totally different from other directors. Johnny Depp plays a machine, which, while in the process of being built, was not completely finished when the inventor and builder died. Scissors were substituted for hands, and so the name Edward Scissorhands. An old lady tells the story of where snow comes from to her granddaughter. Edward lives alone in a Gothic mansion on a hill, left to him by his creator, Vincent Price(yes, the old b movie actor). An Avon sales woman, Peg, visits him and feels sorry that he has no one, and so she takes him to her home. He meets her husband, Bill, their son Kevin, and daughter, Kim(Winona Ryder). He uses his hands to trim their hedges and becomes a sensation in the neighborhood. A woman suggests opening a hair salon with her and she attempts to seduce him. He resists, and she later accuses him of trying to rape her. He picks a lock for someone else, and gets in trouble with the law. At Christmas time, Ed makes an ice angel sculpture, and the shavings create snow, which Kim dances under. He accidentally cuts her with his hand, and is accused of a jealous neighbor of attacking her. He flees back to his house, and is followed by Kim. A confrontation ensues, and Burton give us a Disney like ending. Depp is perfect as the almost human Edward, and Ryder has good chemistry with him. A solid 8/10.",8,0,0,10 September 2012
The White Ribbon," Dark and Haunting
","A cold German drama set in 1913, The White Ribbon, directed by Michael Haneke, known for Funny Games, a sadistic thriller/black comedy, is a distinct change in course for the filmmaker. A man works as a school teacher and is engaged to be married to Eva, a nanny to twins whose father is a local baron.A strict Protestant minister runs the school with an iron hand. He holds confirmation classes and his children must wear white ribbons as a sign of purity and innocence. When his son admits to touching himself, he ties his hands to the bed posts.The widowed doctor is nice to the children, but treats his housekeeper badly and sleeps with his teen daughter at night; lots of drama at this strange village. Payback occurs when doc is riding his horse and it trips over a wire strung between two trees. More bad things happen. The farmer's wife falls through a rotted floor and her husband hangs himself as a result. A barn burns down. The Baron's wife tells her husband that she is in love with another man. The troubles continue until the end, with the start of World War I.The White Ribbon is shot in black and white, adding to the ominous tone, and at almost two and a half hours of nothing good happening to anyone; it is a marathon of agony. Haneke must have serious issues to produce something so dark. Be warned; do not watch this if you are having a bad day.",Null,0,1,5 June 2012
Dreamgirls," OK but long
","A superb cast with Eddie Murphy, Jamie Foxx, and of course the Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson make Dreamgirls a musical drama worth watching. The rise of the Supremes in the 1960s is the inspiration with Beyonce Knowles as the pretty upcoming starlet based on Diana Ross. Jamie Foxx is a car salesmen who starts a female singing group and his character is based on Berry Gordy, who founded Motown records. The payola aspect of the radio industry is well known and is a part of the early success of many musical acts just starting out. It is not sugar coated here. The back stabbing and wheeling and dealing are all included in Dreamgirls. The major problem is that at over two hours it drags a bit. The huge number of actors is overwhelming and tiring. The music is good and the leads are interesting enough for a thumbs up.",6,0,0,3 April 2012
Spider-Man," Fun and smart
","I admit expecting a silly, immature waste of time when I started to watch spider man, believing that I would last about ten minutes. Two hours later, as the credits rolled, I must admit that Sam Raimi made a really good and entertaining comic book adventure suited to adults.Toby Maguire is just right as Peter Parker, with the aw shucks, humble kid next store demeanor for the part. He is smooth and likable and Raimi made the right choice. Dr. Norman Osborn is the central villain and Willem Defoe is a villain from hell who is the right actor for the part. The weak link is Kirsten Dunst who is whiny, clingy and downright annoying. The strengths heavily outweigh the weaknesses so just sit back and enjoy the ride.",8,0,1,14 March 2012

He takes off just before the Strangers show up. These are his evil pursuers, dressed in long black coats and matching Fedora's. Murdoch(Sewell) figures out his name and finds his wife, Emma. A cop, Frank Bumstead, is also looking for him to ask about a series of murders. He discovers some psychic abilities, which he uses to avoid the Strangers, while on the run. The city is in perpetual night, and the Strangers put all of the citizens into comas at midnight and alter their memories.

The police pull over the car and immediately assume the worst. As he is being patted down, he tells the cops to look in the back at the wheelchair, used by the man he is driving to a hospital for an emergency. After they leave, we see that this was all a ruse by the two men.A flashback at a beautiful residence where a row of people are waiting to be interviewed for the job of caretaker for Philippe, and Driss, the driver from the beginning is interviewed by the patient and an assistant. He asks for his application to be signed so that he can continue to collect unemployment. Instead he is hired and learns how to do physical therapy and other tasks.At first he is reluctant to do what he is asked, but in time the odd couple become friends. Driss learns about Philippes life, including the death of his wife. The rich man's lawyer warns him that his new assistant has a criminal record and was in jail for six months. Driss hears Philippe dictating a letter to woman and when he finds out that he has been having a pen pal relationship with the lady, convinces him to call her to set up a real date. After exchanging pictures, they arrange a meeting at a restaurant, but he leaves before she shows up. To get away, they take a private jet and later go paragliding, while strapped to others. Family troubles force Driss to leave to take care of several relatives and Philippe despises his new helper. He grows a scraggly beard and Driss visits and ridicules his ugly facial hair.

The problem is, of course, that no one will hire a rat to work in the kitchen of a restaurant. The obstacle is overcome one day by Remy hiding and passing on instructions to a human cook.

The Exorcist," seriously overrated
","The Exorcist is always ranked amongst the best horror films ever made. I was bored to death by the whole thing. I don't have even the slightest belief in the devil or the Easter bunny for that matter, so I thought that Regan(Linda Blair) spitting out pea soup while her head spun around in a circus like manner was just downright silly. Blair, along with Max Von Sydow, Ellen Burstyn, Jason Miller, and Lee J Cobb are all very good but I thought that Rosemary's Baby and The Devil's Advocate are better movies in this genre than The Exorcist. William Friedkin directed and stayed loyal to the book with a cold and dark atmosphere but the two hour running time seems longer as the run up to the climactic battle between Father Karras and the prince of darkness was too much build up. I remain unimpressed.",3,3,10,4 April 2012

He is sentenced to three years, and is raped by white supremacists for being friendly with a black inmate.Derek is visited by a black teacher from the high school he attended and is told of his brother Danny associating with the racist group on the outside. As Derek is released from prison, he is informed of his brother handing a positive book report on Mein Kampf. The structure of the movie is non linear, with color used for the present, and black and white for the past. The climax happens when Derek confronts the neo nazi leader, Cameron(Stacy Keach) regarding the recruitment of his brother into the group. Director Tony Kaye had good intentions, and Edward Norton is perfect in the lead role, but the last third seemed a bit contrived and preachy for my taste. In spite of its' flaws, American History X is worth watching.",8,0,1,22 July 2012

She lives alone with her dog, Grunt; I am not making this up. Oh, and by the way, she has been accepted into a prestigious dance academy, how could I forget. It only gets worse. Here comes the father figure, Nick(Michael Nouri), her boss at the steel plant, happens to see her performing what looks like a semi erotic number on stage at a local club.

As the bloody confrontation grows more and more ominous for the rebels, a love story unfolds between Rhett and Scarlett.Slavery is also one of the themes addressed, and, in fact Hattie McDaniel was the first black actress to win an Academy Award for her role as Hattie, Scarlett's housemaid.

It all begins with a spaceship above Johannesburg which is boarded and found to be filled with starving aliens. They are given food and shelter and segregated to a district 9. The hatred starts quickly, as the guests are referred to as prawns.

The premise is a good one but the movie meanders while the teen friends of the possessed girl get together to defeat the demon, with Ghostbuster like efficiency. I was mostly bored by the sub par acting and tedious script, which has me bewildered by the 7/10 rating on IMDb.

","First off, this is not a remake of the Charlton Heston 1968 movie which still is a classic. That being said, this version can stand on its own merits. Although I saw the original many years ago, the ending is as memorable and powerful as any I've ever seen. The weakness by comparison is too many cgi special effects which of course weren't available 43 years ago. James Franco is fine as a scientist searching for an Alzheimers cure and Frieda Pinto(Slumdog Millionaire) is beautiful but seems to provide only eye candy and little else. The script is filled with contrived lines and the story is a bit drawn out. John Lithgow plays Franco's senile father with his usual grace. The monkeys are the stars and the scenes on the Golden Gate Bridge are well done. The style is somewhat similar to Raimi's Spiderman I and II but those are much better films.

I was completely caught up in the drama to see where it would end up. Unfortunately, the final half hour becomes rather silly with an unlikely character played by Neil Patrick Harris as a very wealthy man with an incredible house with elaborate cameras which leads to plot hole number one. The second one occurs in the next to last scene which I will not reveal in order not to have a spoiler alert. No need to be a cop; it will be obvious to any alert viewer.

They miss Nemo and he must first choose his parents. They divorce and in one case he lives with his mother and her boyfriend and his daughter, Anna, who invites him for a swim at the beach. He refuses, and years later sees her with her two children. With a second choice, he tells her that he cannot swim and she stays with him on the beach and they become lovers.With a different choice, he lives with his paralyzed father and must be his caretaker.

Jean is the lucky gal, and he marries her and they have two kids, a big house with a pool, but in spite of all the material success, Nemo is still unhappy.Mr. Nobody never really connects on any level.

Django Unchained," Sweet Revenge
","Tarantino does for the slaveholders of the South, what he did for Nazis in Inglourious Basterds in his last film. Django is a wild ride from start to finish. Jamie Foxx is the title character, a slave freed by a German bounty hunter played to perfection by Christoph Waltz, who won an Oscar for his role in Basterds. He shows here that he is no one trick pony, as he and Foxx own the screen for almost its' entire two hour and forty five minute running length. Leonardo DiCaprio shows up as a vicious plantation owner, and he is the perfect villain. Be prepared for inhuman brutality, including a scene with attack dogs that will turn your stomach. However, it is necessary to show the reality of America's unforgivable history. Fox and Waltz are as good a pair as I have ever seen and Samuel L. Jackson shows up about 2/3 of the way in as a right hand man, or house n*****, a term used frequently, and causing some controversy as politically incorrect. Again, as with the graphic violence, the language keeps the movie realistic. The cast is exceptional, and Tarantino's script is cutting and frequently hilarious. No one alive is anywhere near as interesting as him as a writer or director; the man has brass ones. Along with 'Beasts of the Southern Wild,' the best film of 2012.",9,0,4,6 January 2013
Get Out," Slick and Funny
","As I write this in April of 2017, 'Get Out' is the best movie I have seen so far this year. First time writer-director Jordan Peele shows a talent for dialogue similar to Quentin Tarantino for using language which sounds like the way real people speak to one another. Rose(Allison Williams) is a twenty something white girl with a black boyfriend, Chris(Daniel Kaluula). The happy couple travel from NYC to a lily white suburban community north of the big city. The good liberal(we voted for Obama twice, ha ha) parents welcome Chris into the family with big goofy grins. Something isn't quite right in Mayberry, as the story unfolds into an almost 'Stepford Wives' tone. Peeles's script is smart, funny and strikes a perfect balance between comedy and horror. I do not want to give away too much and so I will only advise my fellow movie lovers to sit back and enjoy Peele's excellent rookie effort into the film business.",8,8,18,26 April 2017

They both show very little emotion matching Angelo Badalamenti's score.Mulligan's husband gets out of jail and Gosling helps him pay back fellow criminals he's indebted to. The plot line is going for 'Pulp Fiction' without succeeding. The car chases are well done, but nothing we haven't seen before.The most interesting villain is played perfectly by Albert Brooks as a vicious, violent, low life wanna be gangster.

His eye for superior visuals is evident throughout, and the story is good. In 1944 a portal was built by the Nazis with the guidance of Rasputin, in order to release entities to conquer the world. Sixty years later, the FBI is sent to check out Hellboy, a humanoid creature who was released during Wotld War II. Ron Perlman is the lead, and he is very good, as he battles many different evil doers along the way. A sense of humor is also evident with excellent special effects. The plot is fairly detailed for the genre, and although far-fetched, is based on a comic book, after all. It's worth the ride for del Toro's vision and Perlman's work.",7,0,0,30 July 2012
Good Will Hunting," Brilliant
","Matt Damon is Will Hunting; an underachieving math prodigy working as a janitor at M.I.T. He is discovered by a professor who, through a series of unusual events, is able to recruit the young genius to work on complex math formulas. Hunting has a severely deprived upbringing, involving foster care and physical abuse. Robin Williams; in his Academy Award winning role, shows up as a sympathetic psychiatrist who is recruited to rescue Will from his many demons. Williams and Damon are excellent, and the script is well written and smart, although it turns a bit too sentimental for my taste at the end of over two hours. Van Zant could have tightened up the editing; noisy bar scenes are always an unnecessary tool; and there are at least one too many in Good Will Hunting. Even with its slight defects, the film is well worth watching.",8,1,4,17 August 2014
Room," Gripping
","Brie Larson is Joy, a 24 year-old mother who has been abducted and held captive in a room for seven years. Her son Jack(Jacob Tremblay, with a stunningly believable performance) share the screen together for a long stretch and are absolutely riveting in this heart breaking film. Joy has somehow been able to teach Jack to read and expanded his vocabulary to a high level while trapped in hell. Through sheer willpower they eventually exchange one form of emotional torture for another. The story does not go the way I expected it to, and this is not a criticism. Life is not a bowl of cherries with everything working out in the end. Room is a realistic view of the world carried with two outstanding leads in Larson and Tremblay. One of the ten best movies of 2015.",8,1,6,31 January 2016
The Elephant Man," Hurt is perfect
","John Hurt gives one of the greatest performances ever captured on film as John Merrick in The Elephant Man. David Lynch is very hands off as director and allows Mr. Hurt to portray the tortured soul with such deep emotion and grace. Merrick is abused by a freak show handler named Bytes, a man without a soul who treats his subject like an animal. A Dr. Treves(Anthony Hopkins) sees him at the show and takes him to London Hospital for medical study. The deformities are so horrific that Merrick wears a mask in order to appear in public and the doctors who at first believed that he also suffered from mental defects are astounded to hear him reciting the 23rd psalm. While at the hospital, he reads and proves to be a talented artist, drawing sketches and even building a beautiful replica of a church. He eventually becomes so well known that Queen Victoria is told of his plight and arranges permanent care for Merrick at the hospital. His caretakers take him to an opera house to attend a musical and when he is introduced to the audience, they give him a standing ovation. He finally, for the first time in his life, has a brief moment of happiness. Lynch uses black and white to create a mood which sets the right tone and The Elephant Man is his best work.",9,0,1,10 April 2012
I Am Legend," Nothing new
","Here is another end of the world action film starring Will Smith and a German Shepherd as his loyal companion on the road of an apocalyptic, dark and dreary landscape. The dog is more genuine than Mr. Smith, with his usual aw shucks demeanor which makes me nauseous. Smith is Robert Neville, a man on a mission to find out the cause and cure of the virus which has decimated mankind and has created vampire like creatures. He captures a woman, Ruth, and she seems to be immune and so he injects some of her blood into his body. He passes out and wakes up a prisoner of the undead, of which Ruth is a part of. They are angry with him for killing so many of their compatriots. His fate is left in the hands of his opponents and Smith never convinced me that he was really the hero of this mediocre movie.",6,0,0,3 April 2012
A Quiet Place," Good Horror Film
",John Krasinski directed himself and his wife Emily Blunt as parents of two boys and a girl living in upstate NY not far from where I live in Westchester County. It is an end of the world kind of story with strange reptilian creatures on the prowl for human flesh. They cannot see and rely on super sensitive hearing to locate their prey. Most of the film uses sign language making subtitles a necessity. The settings are creepy and the acting top notch. I do not want to give away too much of the story but it is pretty good. The ending is satisfying and I highly recommend A Quiet Place.,8,6,11,23 May 2018
Kick-Ass," Chloe shines
","Chloe Grace Moretz is Hit Girl, an eleven year old girl trained by her father, Big Daddy(Nicolas Cage) in the use of various weapons. She befriends a nerd named Dave who calls himself Kick Ass, after reading too many comic books. He makes a silly looking costume and becomes a 'superhero,' and in his first encounter he is stabbed and run over by a car. He gets into a fight with Rasul, a drug dealer, and as he is being beaten, Hit Girl and her father come to the rescue and kill the criminal.The crime fighting duo, with the help of Big Daddy, an ex police officer who was framed as a drug dealer and therefore has a vendetta against his perpetrators. The plot is fairly complicated for a comic book inspired action film and although a kid leads the cast, the violence is too strong for young viewers. Moretz is someone to watch for, as she proved later in Let Me In, the American remake of the Swedish vampire movie, Let the Right One in. She and Cage make Kick Ass worth watching.",7,0,2,8 May 2012
Ghostbusters," Unfunny garbage
","How on earth are IMDb users giving this God awful waste of major talents Dan Akroyd and Bill Murray 9 and 10 point ratings. This is one of the worst movies ever made. It's not funny or scary and Ivan Reitman should be forbidden from use of a camera in perpetuity.I sat for almost two hours in amazement at how bad a film can be. I love all genres and I cannot find a category in which to place this disastrous attempt at humor; all involved should have been banned from the industry for at least ten years. Beware of all the positive reviews, of which I have no reasonable explanation; please trust me and avoid this sorry excuse for a comedy.",1,29,70,20 February 2012
Gran Torino," Eastwood still has it
","Walt Kowalski is retired auto worker in Michigan where most of the factories have been shut down. His resentment is taken out on the newly arrived immigrant neighbors who have moved in next door. They are Hmong people from Vietnam and are seen by Walt as the enemy. He is an old fashioned Archie Bunker type of racist not appreciating the changing demographics of America. He pines for the old all white, Christian city that he is used to.After his wife dies, all he has left are distant children and expectant grandchildren waiting for him to die so that they can inherit his classic Ford Torino of the title. Clint Eastwood plays Walt perfectly and his direction is always top notch. The story turns a bit too sentimental but can be forgiven for Hollywood purposes.",8,1,2,15 March 2012
The Hurt Locker," Gritty War Drama
","The setting is Iraq in 2004. Sergeant William James is the new leader of the bomb squad. He replaces Sergeant Matthew Thompson, who has been killed by a remote controlled IED. James is a bit of a cowboy, and he is considered dangerous for his risk taking approach to the job. While driving in their Humvee, they stop at a point where a Ford Excursion is pulled over with a flat tire. Although dressed in Arab clothing, the occupants turn out to be British mercenaries with two captured enemy with bounties on them. They come under fire and kill the four snipers after three of the mercenaries are killed.At a warehouse, James finds the body of a boy with a surgically implanted bomb. He recognizes him as the kid who was earlier selling the soldiers bootleg Dvds. As they leave, the platoons psychiatrist is killed in an explosion. James looks for payback, and breaks into an Iraqi professor's house, but finds nothing. He then comes upon a tanker explosion, and looks for the insurgents by himself. He meets up with Eldridge, a fellow soldier who is shot in the leg during another ambush. The climax occurs during their last two days when an Iraqi civilian walks down the street with bombs strapped to his body. James must remove the locks one by one in order to save the man's life. Director Kathryn Bigelow uses mostly hand held shots with fast editing to give The Hurt Locker the look of a documentary. It is very realistic, and Jeremy Renner and his supporting cast are excellent.",8,0,3,11 June 2012
No Man's Land," Tragic and funny
","No Man's Land won the best foreign language film at the 2001 Academy awards. A war drama set in Bosnia at the time of the Balkan Civil War, it is an excellent look at those trying times. Ciki, a Bosniak, and Nino, a Bosnian Serb, are trapped between enemy lines and trade insults which are, at times absurdly funny. A third soldier, Cera, awakens from unconsciousness and discovers a land mine underneath him which is designed to detonate if he gets up. A sergeant from the United Nations from France named Marchand is ordered to remain neutral and when the story makes the international news, the higher ups change their minds and allow him to try to rescue Cera. Peacekeeping forces finally arrive to lessen the tension but Ciji and Nino continue to bicker. In the meantime, Cera is begging for a bomb squad which may or may not save the day. No Man's Land is a valuable lesson in the futility of war.",8,1,4,22 April 2012
Ex Machina," Interesting Sci-fi
","Ex Machina is a futuristic science fiction movie which looks like a cross between The Stepford Wives and The Terminator. Caleb wins a contest at a Google like company to take on a secret research project. He is flown to a remote, high tech compound where he meets the guy who has built a human like robot. Caleb is to interact with the android, Ava, and reports daily on how well the machine is able to convince him that she can adapt with real people. They are constantly watched on camera and recorded for playback later. Caleb and Ava connect on an emotional level after seven days. The acting is good and the story an interesting one. Some funny moments and an ending which I did not predict, make Ex Machina worth watching.",7,0,2,17 May 2015

He is pursued by police inspector Walter Uhl(Paul Giamatti).Eisenheim falls in love with Duchess Sophie(Jessica Biel). They are separated by a vast difference in their social status. He travels the world and later reunites with the royal beauty and they must overcome many obstacles to the doomed romance. Much political intrigue follows and the secret affair is revealed so that they are both in danger. The plot has many twists and turns so the viewed must pay close attention to detail.

Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Same Old
","This is just another run of the mill comic book adaptation with the usual predictable story line. At least Jessica Alba and Kerry Washington are beautiful enough to give us guys something to look at. Otherwise,I cannot find another reason to recommend it. Then villain is actually a silver guy riding a silver surf board whose mission is to suck all the energy from the earth. The battle scenes are OK but repetitious. The actors seem to have a good time reading through a pedestrian script but at an hour and a half, Rise of the Silver Surfer is a mild diversion from everyday life.",5,1,2,21 August 2019
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Almost great
","Benjamin Button is almost a great film. The problem is the length which is at least 30- 40 minutes too long. It would have worked as a two hour movie. David Fincher needed to get his ego under control and leave some things on the cutting room floor.A backwards running clock starts things going as a reason for the plot of Benjamin Button(Brad Pitt) aging backwards, starting as an old man and time shifting in reverse to youth. F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote the original as a short story. Benjamin falls in love with Daisy(Cate Blanchett) and so begins a life long romance with the twist being that she gets older and he gets younger as the years pass by. Real historical events such as Pearl Harbor are used as a background. Brad and Cate have a natural chemistry and Fincher's visual sense is acute, this is a gorgeous feast for the eyes. I was initially mesmerized by the concept until the final 1/3 which became ultimately exhausting. My only advice to Fincher next time is edit, edit, Edit.",8,1,2,15 March 2012
Hidden Figures," History Lesson
","Hidden Figures is, as the title states exactly that. Three black women math geniuses, along with several others, were used as human computers to calculate intricate formulas necessary for the first manned space shots in 1961. The film is an important history lesson about race and expectations in America. The struggles endured by these brave women is heart breaking. This was the time of separate but equal schools, bathrooms, drinking fountains, and every other facet of life that we now take for granted in a supposed post racial country. John Glenn is shown to be a true hero, not just as the first man in space, but as a color blind human being who puts his faith on a brilliant black woman whose calculations he would rely on for a successful space mission. A bit too long at over two hours, but still one of the ten best movies of the year with a great ensemble cast.",8,3,10,19 January 2017
Sing Street," Boy Meets Girl
","Writer-director John Carney repeats his familiar (Once) boy meets girl rock and roll story in Dublin, Ireland in 1985. The soundtrack features Duran Duran, The Cure, Hall and Oates, and others from that time period. Conor(Ferdio Walsh-Peelo) is a fifteen year old who falls in love at first sight when he spots sixteen year old Raphina(Lucy Boynton) standing on the front steps of a building. He works up the courage to speak with her. She tells him that she is a model who aspires to travel to London and the big time. He says that he is in a band and asks her to star in a music video. The problem is he has no band, and so he manages to gather up some locals and they actually become rather decent musicians and Conor has some talent as a song writer. The rest is fairly familiar and somewhat predictable, but the leads are so charming that Sing Street is worth watching. It is not as good as 'once' but Carney keeps the film interesting and the music is not bad, so crank up the surround sound and enjoy the ride.",7,0,1,17 July 2016
Children of Men," Orwell revisited
","Children of men is set in a dystopian Great Britain of 2027 a now fascist state where all the women are infertile with the exception of Kee, an African immigrant who apparently is the only pregnant woman in the world. Children definitely owes much to George Orwell's 1984 which also foresaw a dark and dreary future for the human race.Kee, the expectant mother, is smuggled underground to avoid the evil doers. The enemy is relentless, as is the violence. Children is similar to and compares favorably with V for vendetta; a sinister mood is shared, and both have excellent ensemble casts. They would make a perfect double feature of doom.",8,1,8,16 March 2012

","George Clooney directed and also stars as Fred Friendly, who was Edward R Murrow's boss during the red scare days in the 1950's. This is well known material well told by Clooney and featuring David Strathairn as the chain smoking news man. The entire film is in black and white, giving it the look of a documentary of the time period. Real footage of Senator McCarthy is used with the intended chilling effect. Murrow is shown sitting at a manual typewriter actually composing his own material for the CBS broadcast. The past equivalent of Fox News; at that time in the print newspaper media, presented a vicious attack on Murrow and anyone attacking Senator McCarthy. History, of course, has proved Murrow courageous and correct for his fight against McCarthy. The movie is only 94 minutes and is a bit fast paced and frenetic, but it is well worth watching.",7,1,1,13 December 2015
Evil Dead," Average Horror Movie
","I saw the original Evil Dead over thirty years ago and I don't remember much about it. Sam Raimi went on to much bigger things afterwards, so my review is based on the remake. It all begins with a girl being abducted and then burned like Joan of Arc to somehow save the world from evil spirits. Flash ahead and three college age girls and two boys arrive at a cabin in the woods for very dubious reasons, other than a brother and sister are there for the girl to rehab from a bad drug overdose. Of course bad things happen to the former junkie, including possession looking something like Linda Blair's in the Exorcist. We get a human skin bound book of the dead which will bring forth the bad spirits, and the usual severed body limbs, with a nail gun and chain saw put to interesting use. I have seen better and I have seen worse horror movies, and Evil Dead is a very average 5/10.",5,1,5,6 July 2013

A club nearby has rap contests, and on his first try, he chokes up and leaves the stage a failure. He works at a factory, doing as many hours as possible, to save enough money to buy a house. On his off time, he still works on his music in preparation for a tournament at the club against other rappers.

From Dusk Till Dawn," Tarantino Script
","Quentin Tarantino is certifiable, and this proves it. Even by his standards, this movie is off the charts. Q.T. plays Rich Gecko, who, along with his brother Seth, have rob ed a bank, and are wanted by the FBI for murder. They stop at a motel on their way to Mexico, and kidnap a reverend Jacob(Harvey Keitel), his daughter, Kate(Juliette Lewis), and adopted son Scott. The family RV is used for their planned escape to Mexico. The sick mind of Tarantino writes a fantasy sequence where he gets dirty talk requesting oral sex from Kate; what a perv, the man is deeply disturbed. Along the way they make the big mistake of stopping at a club which houses vampires. A dancer appears on stage, dressed in a bikini and carrying a snake. It is Santanico(Salma Hayek smolders) and she dances as chaos breaks out. It's bloody vampire time and we get an overdose of flying body parts. Robert Rodriguez directed from the Tarantino script, and the two seem to have been separated at birth; crazy minds think alike. Don't expect Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, but From Dusk to Dawn is above average for the genre.",7,0,1,2 September 2012
Paranormal Activity," Average Thriller
","A guy makes a horror movie for $15,000 and uses hand held video cameras, which is supposed to add to the reality of the film. It just didn't work for me. I found the whole thing tedious and silly. Katie and Micah have moved into a house in San Diego. She claims that something evil has haunted her since childhood and it has followed to their new home. Micah sets up a camera on a tripod to record the bedroom they sleep in every night. At first they only here footsteps. Katie hires a psychic who says that the spirit is not a ghost, but a demon. Night after night the incidents escalate until Katie actually sees some kind of creature in the room. They obtain a Ouija board and after they use it and go out for the night, it catches fire and has a message burned into it. Micah puts down talcum powder and finds footprints leading to the attic. He goes up and finds a burnt photo of Katie there. Shortly thereafter, lights go on and off, doors slam and they invite the psychic, who advices them to leave. Some bad things happen to the two, and apparently, there are two different endings. The film reminded me of Rec, which I believe, is a better movie. Paranormal Activity is just another average thriller.",5,0,0,18 June 2012

Silence," Epic Scorcese
","Martin Scorcese puts his creative heart on the screen for two hours and forty minutes with this extremely personal religious voyage through 1600's Buddhist Japan. Jesuit missionaries, Rodrigues(Andrew Garfield) and Garuppe(Adam Driver) are sent to Japan to search for Father Ferreira(Liam Neeson), who has disappeared and allegedly renounced his faith in order to avoid torture and execution by the Japanese. The pair of priests encounter Catholic converts on their journey and conduct mass in secret because of the severe penalties, including crucifixion, for those practicing the banned religion. Garfield is tremendous as Father Rodrigues and Liam Neeson transcends the deeply moving material, as Scorcese allows his actors to shine, including a mostly Japanese cast. The last fifteen minutes are as memorable as anything I have ever seen. The tortures on display are excruciating to watch, but are historically accurate and necessary. 2016 is a strange year for film, as we have the releases of both Silence and La La Land. The latter has a best director nomination but Martin Scorcese was ignored by the Academy; what a disgrace. Time will prove this to be a major mistake.",8,0,1,15 February 2017

Joker demands that Batman reveal his real identity or someone will die every day at random. A newly appointed district attorney claims to be Batman. He is abducted and placed in a building with explosives. Dent's face is badly burned in an explosion, but he survives. More bombs go off followed by chases on motorcycle and confrontation with the Joker, mobsters and various other villains. I completely lost interest in this endless, two and a half plus hour fiasco. Christopher Nolan needs serious counseling and to learn that some things need to be left out. Rest in peace, Mr. Ledger, it wasn't your fault.",6,4,8,2 April 2012
Into the Wild," great adaptation
","Beautiful film which captures the spirit of the book. Sean Penn's direction deserved an Academy Award nomination as did Emile Hirsch's remarkable performance.The cinematography is first-rate & the soundtrack with Eddie Vedder is a perfect match. My only advice to read the book before seeing the film, as each stands on its own. Mr. Penn is a great director who is capable of getting the best out of the entire cast. Every actor seems very real throughout & Emile Hirsch brings to life Chris Mccandless's wanderlust.Mccandless comes from a seemingly perfect family whose secrets are the reason for the escape away from society that he chooses. He will find out that no matter how far you travel, the problems remain. This is a very sad but compelling drama about a search for the meaning of life, without being overly simplistic.",9,0,1,17 February 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," Bad Kubrick
","I will begin by admitting that I don't like space movies, including Alien which is a slow and uninteresting bore. 2001 has a similar setting without a creature chasing people around a space craft. Instead we get computer named Hal repeating Dave ad nauseum. The film is supposed to be a deep and meditative reflection on the universe and the place we humans belong within it. Stanley Kubrick worked with the science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke on the script with several rewrites. I believe the pair may have ingested a mind altering substance while putting 2001 together because it doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Three years later Kubrick released A Clockwork Orange, which is my favorite film of all time, so I have no explanation for his earlier work.",1,5,17,5 April 2012

Mrs. Robinson Seduces young Benjamin and they have a clandestine affair which is, of course eventually discovered.This is one of the best satires of American life and the great hypocrisy surrounding the supposed values and traditions of the modern nuclear family, still a relevant theme today.Simon and Garfunkel's 'Mrs Robinson' and 'Sounds of Silence' are used on a perfect soundtrack. Buck Henry's script is biting and sardonic and Hoffman and Bancroft are amazing in the two lead roles; a great comedy overall.",8,2,2,10 February 2012

The kid is a spoiled brat who rides horses and her biological dad feels inadequate when compared with his ex-wife's new soul mate.Little Kim informs daddy that she will be traveling to Paris with her best friend, Amanda. He protests the idea, but she sweet talks him into letting her go. The twin tourists meet a stranger who shares a taxi with them. He invites them to a party and when they are abducted while Kim is on the phone with super dad, he warns the bad guys that he is a man with special skills, and that he will find them, and kill them. Anyone else delivering that line would be silly, but with Neeson, it works.Through his many contacts, Mills is able to uncover the Albanian white traffickers responsible for his daughters disappearance. He reverts to his past days as a guy who gets things done in an unconventional and violent matter in order to rescue his offspring. The action sequences are good, and Neeson, a former heavyweight boxer in Ireland, steals Taken with his performance. A sequel is due in 2012, and I can't wait to see it.",8,0,1,26 July 2012
This Is Spinal Tap," Reiner Nails It
","Who would have thought that the meat head from All in the Family would turn out to be such a good director. Norman Lear must have rubbed off during his days on the set of that classic series. Here we have a documentarian, Marty DiBergi(Reiner), following Spinal Tap, a rock band, as they tour to promote their latest album, Smell the Glove. Two childhood buddies, David(Michael McKean) and Nigel(Christopher Guest) are the founders of the group, and they tell Marty of their journey to rock and roll fame. The third man to join them is bass player, Derek (Harry Shearer). The drummers have died in a series of unusual deaths, including spontaneous combustion on stage, and an unexplained gardening accident. The three lead actors are hilarious, and the script, right on target. The funniest moment for me is when Marty is interviewing guitarist Nigel about his amplifier, and the musician explains that his amplifier has a knob which goes to eleven. Asked why not just make eleven the number ten, the rock man looks bewildered, as he says that he sometimes need the higher number for that little extra. The foursome is shown playing to smaller and smaller crowds, as their album tanks. They come up with all kinds of schemes to increase ticket sales. The music is awful, reminding me of Kiss; all stage gimmicks, to cover up a lack of talent. Riner gets it right.",8,0,3,19 August 2012

Grindhouse," Double feature from Tarantino
","Grindhouse is two movies separated by a short, fake upcoming attraction Machete, which was later made into a real film a few years later. I'll start with Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror first, which is a parody of the old science fiction zombie thriller's of the 60s and 70s. Rose McGown is Cherry Darling, a go go dancer wanting a change in her life. A scientist attempts to sell a deadly gas to a military guy and during a fight a chemical is released turning the public into flesh eating ghouls. Cherry and her boyfriend, El Ray become leaders fighting the evil dead. A bit bloody, but Rodriguez has an off beat sense of humorous, so it works.The second feature is Death Proof, Quentin Tarantino's tribute to Vanishing Point, even having the same Dodge Charger for a chase scene. Kurt Russell is stunt driver, Mike, who stalks a group of women in a specially built death proof, super reinforced car. The girls wind up in a demolition derby type of battle with the psychopath and the script is overly verbose, even by Tarantino's usual standards. This is not one his better works.",7,0,0,27 March 2012
La La Land," Gosling's film
","Ryan Gosling proves to be one the most versatile actors working today with his performance in LA La Land. Who knew that he could also sing and dance. My previous favorite film of his is Lars and the Real Doll in which he plays an oddball who falls in love with a mail order doll and his family and friends to along with his illusions. His partner here is Emma Stone as an aspiring actress who works as a waitress and struggles to survive. Gosling is a jazz pianist, and, of course, they fall in love as they pursue their dreams. The music is good, including John Legend as a singer and band leader who provides an established star for Gosling to work with. I am not a fan of the musical genre, especially actors singing lines at each other. I find the format tedious. I was able to overcome my previous prejudices and actually sit back and appreciate the story. The ending in not a typically Hollywood one, so La La Land is one of the best movies of 2016.",8,2,7,25 January 2017
Saw," Too much hype
",Two guys are chained to the floor in a bathroom with a gun and a cassette player which has instructions for escape. A bloody corpse lies in between them. It gets complicated from here. The recording tells Larry must kill Adam before he escapes or his wife and daughter will die.They find a hacksaw in a bag but they are unable to cut the chains and contemplate cutting off their feet. A flashbacks shows Larry lecturing students when detectives arrive to question him about his pen light being found at the scene of a jigsaw game. His wife and daughter have been kidnapped and are being watched through a mirror. A good deal of violence follows but I just did not care about any of the characters and I was bored by this horror flick.,6,1,3,3 April 2012
Life Is Beautiful," Modern Classic
","Roberto Benigni wrote, directed, and is the lead character, Guido Orefice, a Jewish- Italian man in this black comedy which won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1997. It reminded me of Lena Wertmuller's Seven Beauties from 1975; though, in my opinion, not as good. Guido pursues Dora, a non-Jewish girl from a wealthy family who are not thrilled with her future husband. They have son, Giosue, and the family is put into a concentration camp on the boy's birthday, so Guido makes the experience into a game to protect his son from the horrors of the war. He tells him that if he hides from the guards and keeps quiet, he will earn points with the top prize being a tank.They continue in the ploy until the American troops arrive to liberate the camp. Benigni is likable and his real life wife, Nicoletta Braschi, is Dora, his on screen spouse, and they have wonderful chemistry together. Giorgio Cantarini as their son, completes an excellent casting decision. Sometimes funny, but also devastatingly sad, Benigni has made an unforgettable movie which is a modern classic.",9,2,3,16 May 2012

","I can't believe that I'm reviewing a cartoon; but what the hell, maybe my second childhood is near. Carl Fredricksen(Ed Asner) was a lonely little boy who worships an explorer named Charles Muntz, a man who was disgraced for faking the discovery of a big bird in Venezuela. He meets Ellie, a neighbor who shares his passion for nature. When they grow up they marry, but are unable to have children. He sells balloons and she works at a zoo. They have always intended to travel to South America to verify Muntz's claims to clear his name. The best laid plans of mice and men prevent it and Elle dies, leaving Carl alone. His house is surrounded by a new development, but he refuses to leave. He injures a construction worker in a dispute, and receives an eviction notice. He comes up with the idea to attach thousands of helium balloons to lift the house into the air and fly it to Venezuela and fulfill his dream of finding Muntz's bird. He takes off with a stowaway, Russell, who is trying to earn a merit badge by helping the elderly. They meet a non flying bird and a talking dog along the way.

He is offered a way out of jail by submitting to a new and revolutionary method to cure his badness. What follows is a great morality tale balancing the need for a safe society free from violence and the rights of the individual. Kubrick uses Beethoven throughout, matching the action perfectly. 'Singing in the Rain' will never be quite the the same after Alex's a cappella performance here. This is not Gene Kelly in a top hat. Even after repeated viewings, I am still in awe of this masterpiece.",10,0,2,9 February 2012

Reservoir Dogs," Tarantino's best
","Quentin Tarantino wrote and directed Reservoir Dogs in what may be the greatest film debut ever. A 1.2 million dollar budget is stretched to the limit with a tremendous ensemble cast including Harvey Keitel as Mr. White, Steve Buscemi as Mr. Pink, Tim Roth as Mr. Orange, Michael Madsen as Mr. Blondel(his most sadistic role), and Tarantino as Mr. Brown. The structure is very unconventional, relying on flashbacks and running backwards at times. The script is dazzling, funny and viciously sarcastic; the usual Tarantino trademarks, as used in the much more well known 'Pulp Fiction.' This is darker and more twisted than P.F.The crime is a simple diamond heist by the Multicolor named cast. The high point is Mr. Blondel(Madsen) in a torture scene involving a knife and Stealers Wheels song 'Stuck in The Middle with You.' You will never hear the tune the same way again. This is one of my ten best films, a great ride.",9,0,0,2 March 2012
"SalÃ², or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Pointless

Pier Pasolini takes a decidedly off color view of the war period.A duke, a magistrate, a bishop, and the president come up with the idea to marry each others daughters. They also have nine women and nine men abducted and taken to a palace. Four middle aged prostitutes are added to the mix to tell erotic stories. The four statesman escalate the humiliation and torture to the point of having one unfortunate woman eat the duke's feces, which is then served as dinner to other hapless victims. I am not making this up. The fun festivities continue with shootings, scalpings, brandings, and for the ultimate crowd pleaser, someone's tongue being cut out; now that's entertainment. I am not easily offended., but Salo is just a pointless exercise in shock value. There is no reason to sit through two hours or more; depending on which version is available, to spend an evening being nauseated.",2,4,13,22 July 2012

Two men and a woman rob houses using information obtained by a guy whose father runs a home alarm company and so he has the codes to disable the alarms. The trio hear of a large amount of cash in the blind mans house and they figure it should be easy pickings. Not so fast, boys and girl, this victim is one tough son of a bitch with a vicious Rottweiler to provide an extra layer of nastiness.

Shine," Outstanding Rush
","Shine is the real life story of David Helfgott, a gifted pianist suffering from some severe mental problems. Three different actors portray the tortured soul at three stages of his life, concluded by Geoffrey Rush's stream of consciousness and Oscar winning performance, which makes the film well worth the occasionally bumpy ride. A strict and domineering father physically beats and mentally abuses young David; all while telling him what a lucky boy he is to have a good family. After his dad forbids his travel to America, David later works up the courage to move to England to study music on scholarship. After a difficult concert, he has a nervous breakdown which leads to a stay at a mental hospital where he receives shock treatment.

Departures," Poetry
","Departures is the appropriate title, as the subject matter is death. Daigo is a cellist with an orchestra in Tokyo which has money problems. They are broken up and he becomes unemployed with little hope of finding a job playing the obscure instrument. He travels back to his boyhood home with his wife, Mika.Daigo answers an ad for assisting departures; having no idea what the phrase means. At the interview, he is asked if he will work hard.

Instead of Uncle Miltie, we are treated to Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon in drag hiding from mobsters involved in the saint valentines day massacre. They play musicians on tour with Marilyn Monroe and oh it is so damn hilarious to watch the pair try to hide the fact that they are red blooded American males who would love to jump the blonde bombshells bones.Monroe looks good but both her singing and acting are quite ordinary. I have never been mesmerized by the whole Norma Jean cult which has always escaped me. Curtis and Lemmon try to hard and might as well be drag queens in a John Waters film. I love to laugh and I never did sitting through this bad comedy.",1,12,41,5 April 2012
Pulp Fiction," Mind blowing
","So Quentin Tarantino brought John Travolta back from the dead with his casting in Pulp Fiction. Along with Samuel Jackson's Bible spouting psychopath, this is a stroke of genius. Pulp is a wild wild ride from start to finish. The story is not traditional in any way. Jules(Jackson) and Vincent(Travolta) are paid assassins hired by a gangster to deliver a briefcase with something of value which is never identified. The proceed on a bloody killing spree done in Tarantino's usual comic book style.

She speaks with her senile mother on the phone, but her mother is confused and believes that her daughter is her sister. Julie destroys her husbands last composition, which was to celebrate the end of the cold war and European unity. There are hints that she actually wrote the piece.

Sally Hawkins stars as a mute woman living in isolation who works at a top secret government facility who have captured a reptile like being who looks like the creature from the black lagoon. Del Toro was obviously influenced by 1960's American movies and television. Michael Shannon plays the requisite sadistic bad guy in charge of keeping the half man, half beast tamed, often with a cattle prod. Hawkin's, of course, falls in love with the lizard man and must help to save him from the evildoers. The Shape of Water is not a children's fairy tale, as Hawkins is often quite naked in the film.

Seeking revenge on the two sisters, they end up in a battle and eventually negotiate a truce, and travel together as a foursome. They make it to Hollywood and meet Bill Murray at his house. He is disguised as a zombie, which leads to a very funny outcome. The finale is at an amusement park where they turn on the rides with the lights attracting hordes of the flesh eaters.

The Departed," good 3/4 but bad ending
","The Departed starts out great with Jack Nicholson narrating an overview of the crime scene in Boston beginning in the 1960s. Jack is Frank Costello, head of the Irish mob and at war with the older Italian Mafia. Frank befriends Colin Sullivan(Matt Damon) who joins the state police organized crime unit and becomes an informant to Jack, providing him with vital information. Billy Costigan(Leonardo Di Caprio) is chosen to go undercover and then commits a crime in order to establish credibility with the mobsters and infiltrates the criminal underworld. Departed then becomes a cat and mouse game with each side being aware of the others existence but knowing the actual identity. The cast is magnificent, with Jack, Leonardo, Matt, plus Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, and Alec Baldwin, it is an allstar lineup. The problem is both the two and a half hour running time and closing fifteen minutes so bad that it's laughable. It's as if Moe, Larry and Curley from the three stooges took over from Scorcese to complete the project. Best Picture; no way, it should have been Pan's Labyrinth, a masterpiece from Guillermo Del Toro. The academy blew it, big time.",7,0,0,26 March 2012

He invites her to dinner and she overhears him arguing with her over the proposed date. Mom is the ultimate control freak and she warn him about the evil ways of women. What follows may be the most famous shower scene in the history of cinema, so there is no need to describe it here, as no one since as been able to improve on Alfred Hitchcock's subtle way of making the viewer actually use their own imagination. A standard detective drama follows with Marion's sister Lila(Vera Miles) pairing up with private eye Milton Arbogast(Martin Balsam) to find her missing sibling.

Here she is the mother of several children living on a farm and working as sharecroppers. One son serves in Europe as a soldier and returns to the nightmare of the South's segregation.

This is a long and draining experience for the entire two hours and fifteen minute running time. The entire cast is exceptional but be prepared to be emotionally exhausted in the end. Director McQueen has a keen eye for detail but sometimes lingers a bit longer then necessary at times. His previous efforts, Hunger and Shame were guilty of similar excesses.

His son and daughter are in the courtroom as their father wishes to teach them a lesson about fairness and the evils of prejudice.

She runs the ward at the hospital and the power struggle between the two is gripping and in the end heartbreaking. The third great performance is that of Will Sampson as an apparently mute Native American with troubles of his own. Milos Forman's direction is minimal, allowing the great cast to appear to be ad libbing the story. The characters are so believable and natural that this has the look of a documentary.

The man is a Vince Lombardi type of instructor who treats everyone with equal contempt in order to get the best out of them. I am not a fan of jazz, but I as a music lover, I was able to appreciate the struggles of musicians of any kind. Teller is excellent as the kid who plays so hard that his hands bleed, and Paul Reiser appears as his supportive father.

Sam Jackson is the leader of the army guys fresh out of Vietnam in 1973. Real news footage of FDR, JKF, Ike, and Tricky Dicky are well used to start the adventure. A soundtrack with Creedence, Bowie, Black Sabbath and more great 70s music make this a fun ride. The story is secondary to the action scenes with the big gorilla battling giant lizards and other esoteric creatures. The CGI effects are excellent and the cast is superb, although Ms. Larson's hair is never out of shape as she slogs through the jungle with an apparent hairdresser equipped with a blow dryer to maintain her perfect quaff. Brie's hair is a minor complaint as I was totally entertained for the entire two hour running time.",8,3,4,19 October 2017
The Shawshank Redemption," Stephen King's best adaptation
","The Shawshank Redemption is actually a short novel written by Stephen King. Tim Robbins is falsely imprisoned for the murder of his wife. He becomes best friends with Morgan Freeman and plots an escape using a small hammer to slowly create an opening in the wall which is covered with posters.Freeman narrates the story and he and Robbins make a terrific pair struggling to survive prison life while keeping their sanity. They manage to make it through their days by dreaming of the perfect escape. King has written a tale of hope and inspiration which is adapted with great style and grace by Frank Darabont. He later made King's Green Mile in 1999, another excellent prison drama.",9,0,0,28 February 2012
Parasite," Bong Joon Ho Directs another Winner
","Bong Joon Ho directed one of my favorite movies of 2017, Okja, and has done it again in 2019 with Parasite. A working class family worms their way into the lives of a wealthy family with unexpected results. Ho has written a sardonic satire which loses nothing in translation from Korean to English. Koreans, like we American counterparts, have a 99% and a 1% who look down on the rest of us with disdain. The script is right on point and the entire cast is excellent. Easily one of the ten best films of 2020.",9,17,26,21 January 2020
The Big Short," Complicated
","The Big Short uses comedy to try to explain the credit default swap fiasco which culminated in the mortgage crisis of 2008. Christian Bale is excellent as the real life hedge fund manager who besides being a doctor is a wizard of Wall Street. Dr. Berry figured out years before the collapse that the mortgage industry was mostly fraudulent and being covered up by the big banks and the bond rating agencies. He figured out a way to bet that the bubble would burst, and he was correct. It can be a bit difficult to follow, but writer-director McKay uses cameos by Selena Gomez and a world famous chef to explain some of the esoteric financial terms. The cast, led by Bale, and reinforced by the always good Steve Carrell and Melissa Leo, is uniformly excellent. The topic is interesting and by the end of the movie, you will be infuriated by a completely corrupt political and financial system.",8,6,8,14 February 2016
Paths of Glory," Anti war Kubrick
","Kubrick' s first military drama, predating 'Full Metal Jacket' by thirty years was the 1957 World War One film 'Paths of Glory.' Kirk Douglas stars as Colonel Dax, who is ordered by his commanding officers to continue an impossible attack on the German enemy who are holding a position which will only result in sure death for his soldiers.Dax's troops are later court martialed for treason and are forced to endure a military trial. This movie is based on a true story and it is handled hauntingly by Kubrick. History does have a way of repeating itself and 'Paths of Glory' should be required viewing for the leaders of every country and every military officer in the world",9,0,1,8 March 2012
Blow," Depp and Cruz sizzle
","Johnny Depp is George Jung, in Blow, a true story about the cocaine industry, from Mexico to Colombia. At the beginning George meets a stewardess, and uses her to smuggle marijuana into Boston. As the demand grows, he travels to Mexico to buy large quantities from drug lords. He gets caught with over 600 pounds of pot, and he is given a two year prison sentence. He skips bail and hides at his parent's house. His mother calls the police, and he is sent to a federal prison, where he meets Diego, who has ties to the Medellin cartel in Colombia. They travel there and set up an operation which grows bigger and bigger. He is introduced to the infamous Pablo Escobar, and they become partners in the coke business. George suffers a heart attack and his wife gives birth to a daughter, which causes him to reevaluate his life and give up selling drugs. Of course, the need for more money eventually lures him back, and he is again arrested and winds up back in jail. Along the way, he suffers many family crises with his wife, daughter, mother and father. It is a sad story with excellent performances by Depp and Penelope Cruz as his wife.

This time, Neeson is in Istanbul, Turkey, when the father of one of the guys he killed in the first film gathers his flock of gangsters to kill Neeson. His family happens to be there, and so, he must rescue them from the evil villains. Nothing new in this go round, but Liam makes the ninety two minutes go by briskly, and in spite of his extremely annoying offspring, I was able to tolerate the spoiled brat and just sit back and laugh at the adventure.

Black Panther," Good Action Film
","The Black Panther is a standard action movie with a predominantly black cast. Chadwick Boseman is the lead character and Lupita Nyongo the lead actress. They have good chemistry and the story is well written. It opens in Oakland, California and flashes back to a fictitious African nation with a super metal which has been hidden from the rest of the world for many years. Thhey fight with other countries and with themselves in this two hour and fourteen minute epic. The CGI is top notch but the film could have used some editing, as it feels a bit too long. Otherwise, just sit back and relax and enjoy an adventure in order to escape the every day realities of life.",7,0,1,31 May 2018
Any Given Sunday," For NFL Fans
","Get ready for some football. You probably need to be a fan of the NFL; full disclosure here, I am a Green Bay fanatic for 45 years, so I am the perfect audience for Any Given Sunday. Others may not be as satisfied with the story. Al Pacino is a jaded coach with thirty years experience, now leading the Miami Sharks, a team on the decline. His starting quarterback gets injured, and the back up is an arrogant guy who plays by his own rules. Willie Beamen(an excellent Jamie Foxx) is the strutting QB, and although he struggles learning the system at first, he develops into a star. He gets commercial endorsements and a music video. He becomes a complete prima donna, and draws resentment from the rest of the team. Despite the friction, he leads them to the playoffs. With the starting QB ready to return, the coach must decide who to start in the next round of the playoffs. Some real players are used, including Terrell Owens and Lawrence Taylor, which make it look very authentic. The football scenes are well done and the sub plots good. The cast is without a weakness, and the only drawback is the length, which at over 2 1/2 hours is a bit much. Oliver Stone has a tendency to leave in too much. I'll compromise at a 7.5/10.",7,1,2,3 September 2012

Fantastic Mr. Fox," Creative Story
","Roald Dahl was well known for his fantasy stories which were Twilight Zone type of tales. Mr. Fox was one of his children's books. As the name implies, the lead is a fox. George Clooney is the voice of Mr. Fox and his wife, Felicity(Meryl Streep) get caught in a trap while stealing from a farm. He then becomes a newspaper writer, and moves his family to a house at the base of a tree, despite the warnings of his lawyer Badger(Bill Murray). The tree is close to the farms of Boggis, Bunce, and Bean, three very mean and ambitious men. After Fox steals food from their farms, they shoot at him but only blow his tail off. They also remove the tree above his den with a bulldozer. They wait at the entrance with guns for the animals to come out, and nearing starvation, Fox digs tunnels to the farms and takes more food. The farmers flood the tunnels and Fox and his neighbors are forced to live in a sewer. The battle with the farmers continues and Clooney's Mr. Fox leads the opposition to the very end. The animation is excellent, and although I' m not the biggest fan of cartoons, I was amused by The Fantastic Mr. Fox.",7,0,2,9 June 2012

At twenty three she works as a waitress at a cafe, along with other oddball characters. When she hears of the death of Princess Diana, she drops a bottle cap, which hits a tile, and loosens it. Behind the tile, she finds a box with a collection of stuff from a young boy who lived in her apartment many years before. She decides to track down the guy who left the box there. She manages to find him and places the box in a phone booth and rings the phone as he walks by. He is brought to tears by the contents of the box and vows to reconcile with his estranged family because of it. Amelie now becomes a matchmaker and do gooder, secretly making the lives of others better. She meets a blind man at the metro train station, takes his hand and gives him a description of the streets they walk along.

Amelie performs several more good deeds and eventually meets a man named Nino who collects pictures from passport photo booths to make a collage. The two are equally eccentric and what happens next, I will not give away. Romantic comedies are usually awful, but Amelie is excellent.",8,1,4,20 July 2012
Moonrise Kingdom," Magical
","Wes Anderson has created a magical world with a superb cast including two twelve year olds who match the talents of Bill Murray, Bruce Willis, Frances McDormand, Edward Norton, and Harvey Keitel. Kara Hayward and Jared Gilman are Suzy and Sam, a couple of outcasts who have no friends and are considered trouble by the adults around them. Sam is a foster child struggling with loneliness, and Suzy is an introvert; and they seem to have been fated to meet, and when they do, a pen pal relationship develops. Sam is at a boy scout camp on an island, and Suzy is living with her mother and father, with three younger brothers in a seemingly perfect house with white picket fence, and everything in its place. Sam runs away, as does Suzy, and they find each other and escape with a tent and other gear to get away from the elders who don't understand them. Although very young, the pair have a connection which belies their age. This is basically a love story. The settings are striking, with strong red and blue pastels, the houses perfect, in a Norman Rockwell kind of way. The style reminded me of Jean Pierre Jeunet's Micmacs, another quirky film. I was caught up with the story from start to finish. Kara Hayward and Jared Gilman are exceptional finds by Anderson, and they are able to carry Moonrise Kingdom to a level of true art.",8,2,4,22 September 2012
The Sixth Sense," A Good Mystery
","The incredible hype surrounding M. Night Shyamalan as the next Alfred Hitchcock is a bit premature in retrospect. He has turned out to be another Orson Welles(Citizen Kane) instead. I wasn't crazy about Welle's so called masterpiece, and although I was entertained by The Sixth Sense, it is nowhere near my favorite films of all time. Bruce Willis is a psychologist who is shot in the stomach by a former, disgruntled patient. The guy then shoots himself. Months later, Dr. Crowe(Willis) treats a new patient, Cole, who has similar problems to the man who shot him. Cole tells him that he sees dead people. Through a series of events, the doctor is convinced that the kid does have a unique ability, and he tells him to use it to help others. The boy solves the crime of a little girl poisoned by her mother. Other strange visions occur until a big surprise ending, which I did not guess. The movie is very good, but not as great as advertised.",8,0,0,6 July 2012
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Creative Slasher Film
","Wes Craven directed Nightmare in 1984, and it spawned several sequels and a television series. It was Johnny Depp's first film and made Freddy Kreuger a household name. At the beginning, we see a dark figure wearing a fedora, walking through a boiler room. His gloves sprout a long knife blade from the fingertips of his right hand.Flash to a teenage girl, Tina, asleep and having a nightmare where a burned man is chasing her until she wakes up with four slashes on her night gown.

Rod is arrested for her murder. He is found hanging in his jail cell. The story unfolds that Freddy was put on trial for murdering twenty children, but released on a technicality. The parent's burned him alive, and now he is getting his revenge on the teens of the town. The story is solid and the imagery very creative. Nightmare on Elm Street remains one of the better slasher movies.",8,0,0,27 August 2012
Deadpool," Funny and Entertaining
","Ryan Reynolds is Wade Wilson, a former special forces guy who transforms into a superhero who names himself Deadpool. This is a very different comic book adventure with numerous inside jokes including a couple of shots of a People magazine cover with Reynolds pictured as the sexiest man alive. The language and a brief sex scene give the film an R rating, and the CGI is as good as expected. Reynolds and love interest Vanessa(Morena Baccarin) have good chemistry and the villains; especially Ajax(Ed Skrein) are excellent. A good story line and great casting; including Leslie Uggams as an old eccentric blind woman make Deadpool a solid 8/10.",8,6,16,5 June 2016
Cloud Atlas," Complex and Interesting
","Cloud Atlas runs almost three hours, and it could have used some editing. Although it has some beautiful moments, the constant abrupt jump from story to story in different time periods, is somewhat confusing. Tom Hanks and Halle Berry are both very good in multiple roles. Hugh Grant and Hugo Weaving round out an excellent cast throughout. The main problem is the mix between serious drama and science fiction action elements which are loud as hell compared with the subtle scenes with interesting dialogue. I understand that we are all connected as human beings in a struggle to survive, and that all of our actions have consequences, some large and others small. The Wachowski's have done it much better before, especially with V for Vendetta, one of my favorite films of all time; they have deep and profound thoughts. Even with its flaws, Cloud Atlas is worth the ride.",7,1,4,19 May 2013
300," Beautiful Cinematography
","Frank Miller's Sin City was adapted to the big screen successfully, and now, 300 follows suit, with the difference being that 300 is an historically based drama. The battle of Thermopylae, in which three hundred Spartan soldiers, led by King Leonidas, battle one million Persians. The king uses an interesting strategy, where he finds terrain with a narrow passageway to force the vastly larger army to be narrowed, and thus making it possible to fight them in smaller numbers.Gerard Butler as the king, and Lena Headey as his wife have strong chemistry, but unfortunately, the majority of the cast look like Cippendale dancers, with bodies shaved, and ready for a night at the Gay Pride Parade in Greenwich Village on Halloween. The battle scenes are excellent, with breathtaking cinematography, and colors so rich, that it will blow you away. The biggest complaint seems to be with how much of 300 is true. We will never know the answer to that question; but in the meantime, just sit back and be dazzled.",8,1,2,17 August 2012
Green Book," Best Movie of the Year

Mortensen is Tony the lip, a bouncer/driver who works the Copacabana in 1962 when the club is closed for renovations. He is hired by pianist Don Shirley (Ali) and it is off to the road for a concert tour. The north is is no problem but the south becomes a nightmare of racism for both men. The story is a beautiful one of discovery for the pair. The script is funny and tragic and Farrelly does a great directing job of the two stars. This is my pick for best picture at the Oscars and Mortensen for best actor. Please see this great film",9,9,17,2 January 2019

A local community center is in shambles and needs a complete overhaul, so our savior will come to the rescue and boy can she multi task.

Jackie Brown," Tarantino Lite
",", I love Pam Grier and Tarantino is my favorite director. That being said, I was disappointed in his follow up to Pulp Fiction, a much better film. Pam is Jackie, a stewardess on a Mexican airline who smuggles cash for a gun runner named Ordell(Samuel L. Jackson). One of his workers, Beaumont, is arrested and jailed, so Ordell pays a bondsman, Max, to get him out in order to kill him before he turns informant. Too late, as he has already given Jackie's name and she is busted with planted cocaine and sent to the pokey. Her boss sends Max to bail her out and he is awed by her body and will not set her up to be killed. Instead they go back to her house where she pulls a gun on Ordell, and they make a deal where she will smuggle half a million dollars for him and he will retire. Of course, there is no honor among thieves, and Q.T. uses several plot twists throughout the Elmore Leonard inspired movie. It is also a tribute to Foxy Brown, the 60s blaxploitation film which starred Pam Grier. She still looks great; a very well preserved and sexy woman. The major problem is the 2-1/2 hour plus running time, which needed a good 1/2 hour edited out. Also, Bridget Fonda is one of the most annoying actresses on earth. She should go away forever. The rest of the cast is good, especially Robert Forster as Max and Robert DeNiro as Louis Gara. The length and Fonda's bad acting ruin it for me.",7,0,2,23 August 2012
Inside Llewyn Davis," Interesting Character Study
","The Coen brothers previous musically themed effort, O brother, Where Art Thou, proved that the boys have a knack for finding good music. Llewyn Davis is a struggling folk singer in New York in 1961. Oscar Isaac is a revelation in the title role. He has a great voice and hits just the right tone as a somber, starving and wandering artist. Carey Mulligan is a girlfriend and fellow singer, who, besides being an excellent actress, is also a talented singer. The entire cast is good, and the Coen's script has the expected sardonic humor we have come to expect. I am taking away a point for an extended scene with John Goodman which is funny for a few minutes, but drags on and is out of place in this film. The music is beautiful and makes this a movie worth watching.",7,0,0,18 January 2014
Sin City," Super cool
","Sin City is a Frank Miller graphic comic brought to the screen by Miller as co-director along with Robert Rodriguez. It is violently entertaining ride from start to finish. Mickey Rourke is Marv, wearing such incredible prosthetics, that I didn't realize it was him until I read the credits. There are several story lines and Rourke's is my favorite. He awakens next to a murdered prostitute and is framed by corrupt policemen. He is in and out of the story while seeking the real killer and uncovering a web of deception.The second most interesting character is Rutger Hauer as Cardinal Patrick Henry Roaring, a rather nasty man of the cloth with disgusting tastes; a deeply disturbed individual. The confrontation between the Cardinal and Marv(Rourke) is one of the most vicious and memorable scenes since Michael Madsen's ear cutting scene in 'Reservoir Dogs.' Of course co-director Rodriguez is good friends with Quentin Tarantino's, and Q.T. directed one of the segments here.Bruce Willis also appears as a older cop in bad health trying to save a stripper played by the beautiful Jessica Alba, in a father-daughter relationship which is one of the plot lines from Miller's books.Many other characters appear including Brittany Murphy and Rossario Dawson as prostitutes and the aforementioned Michael Madsen as a cop. The ensemble is without weakness and this looks like a comic book translated to film with vivid colors of same. A sequel is in the works and I have high expectations.",9,2,3,1 March 2012

They get to the cabin and find strange things in a cellar, including a diary written partially in Latin. In the meantime, a group of people in a high tech place are watching TV monitors tracking the five unsuspecting kids. They can control the conditions of the environment, and Oscar nominated Richard Jenkins(for The Visitor) is the head of this mysterious experiment in terror. While in the woods, zombies appear, making the boys and girls stay rather unpleasant. The Night of the Living Dead meets The Running Man as more blood thirsty creatures arrive on the scene. The young victims are standard horror movie fodder, and Jenkins is well above the rest of the cast and the material. Sigourney Weaver also makes a brief cameo, thirty plus years after Alien. Overall, a little better than average.",6,1,4,24 August 2012

Braveheart," Awesome
","O.K., we need to separate Mel Gibson, the actor and director from the raving racist lunatic we have been subjected to in the news. In front of or behind a camera the man is a genius. Now to Braveheart; without question, the artist Gibson has created a great historically based biography of William Wallace, who in the 13th century led an army against the British against great odds and triumphed on several occasions. Wallace's bravery in battle is legendary and Gibson is perfect in the role. His rise and fall after many brutal and violent encounters, is breathtaking. Braveheart is a true epic in the best sense of the word. The three hours move very quickly and the ending is not easy to watch but the life of William Wallace was certainly worthwhile.",9,2,5,1 March 2012

Inside is a large quantity of cocaine. He and Alabame head for California with the stolen coke in the trunk. They are pursued by a mobster, Vincenzo((Christopher Walken). Clarence stops at his father's for information on the pimp's murder, because his dad is a retired cop. Dennis Hopper is brilliant as he is interrogated by Walken in classic Quentin Tarantino dialogue. The 'n' word is used frequently as it relates to the Moors and the Italians shared ancestry, according to Hopper, as he gives Walken a quick history lesson regarding his family tree. Further violence occurs and the chase is on. A good story with great acting make this a solid 8/10.",8,0,1,28 August 2012

The sharks and the jets remain in my head forevermore; sheer torture. Maybe I've mellowed with age because I was actually entertained by animated dancing arctic birds who cannot fly.One bird sings heart break hotel and another is a super tap dancer. I know it sounds ridiculous but the creators of Happy Feet make it all work.An environmental message is delivered as a scientific expedition discovers that over fishing is decimating the animal population.

Mad Max: Fury Road," Fast Paced
","The five out of ten rating for Mad Max is based solely on the stunningly beautiful visuals of the desert sands which are featured almost continuously. The story and script are rather silly, with a wasted Charlie Theron, and the equally talented Tom Hardy(see Bronson for a real taste of Mr. Harry's acting ability.) The pair spend two hours being chased by numerous evil bald men with a variety of weapons and exotic vehicles with gigantic tires for easy navigation through the off road terrain. I grew tired of the repetitive nature of the battle scenes, even though they are spectacular at first. A large screen is mandatory for this epic.",5,2,7,19 July 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," Gibson's War
","Mel Gibson may be a racist lunatic in his real world life, but he is one hell of a movie director. His eye for detail in Hacksaw Ridge is impeccable. Andrew Garfield is Desmond Doss, a deeply religious man who will not carry a weapon or kill due to his Seventh Day Adventist upbringing. Early on, he encounters a bureaucratic wall, as the military informs him of the necessity of carrying a gun in combat. Doss eventually is able to travel to Japan as a medic and winds up in some extremely vicious and bloody battles near Okinawa in 1945, just before the end of World War II. The fighting scenes are fairly typical of previous war films and the basic training insult laden, politically incorrect drill sergeant are lifted from Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket.' Mel can be forgiven for this, as the character development is fully realized by Garfield and the supporting cast never hits a false note. The last few minutes are a beautiful tribute to a real American hero and Hacksaw Ridge is one of the ten best movies of the year.",8,2,6,8 February 2017

What happens next involves a series of events including time travel and a highly unusual love story combined with science fiction. Jake's real life sister Maggie plays that role here and the two have great chemistry together on screen; it's perfect casting.

V for Vendetta," Mind blowing masterpiece
","V for Vendetta is a dark and ominous warning to anyone with any sense of history who is paying attention to what is happening in the world today; history does have a way of repeating itself. With a great debt to George Orwell's 1984, the Wachowski brothers have spun an absolute masterpiece.Britain is used as the country with complete media control, warning the public about protesters who are portrayed as enemies of the state.'V' is a masked rebel who travels throughout the land making great proclamations along the way. Hugo Weaving is the undercover hero and he is mesmerizing. He recruits Evey(Natalie Portman's best work, forget 'Black Swan'). Together, they use destructive tactics to awaken the public to the danger of the present fascist government. The great John Hurt is the nations leader and his face is on a big screen with his deep, important sounding baritone, alerting his citizens of the dangers of protest. The message here is important, and it is told in a way which is solidly entertaining. This is one of the best films ever made, a 10 out of 10.",10,3,7,20 February 2012
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Clooney and Coen's
",Brother where art thou is taken from Preston Sturges World War 2 era comedy Sullivan's Travels in which a movie director sets out to chronicle the misery of the depression. Instead he decides that people in the country need to have something to laugh at. The Coen brothers use Sturges' style in a prison escape comedy with George Clooney leading the way. Ulysses(Clooney) has been informed by a cell mate that he has buried over one million dollars and that it will be underwater due to a project creating a man made lake in four days time. The escaping convicts meet hobos on the railways and encounter a Christian revival and are baptized along the way. Further adventures include a run in with th ku klux klan and a man with a radio station recording Christian music. The accompanying soundtrack is awesome and the Coen brother have made a lasting tribute to Preston Sturges.,8,0,0,19 March 2012
The Godfather," Brando rules
","The most famous mafia movie ever made is still the best and the standard by which all others are judged. Maroon Brando transforms himself into Don Corleone, a mob boss of the old school which is changing in the new and violent drug culture.Al Pacino is Michael, his son and most likely heir apparent. A power struggle ensues with the five families of New York. The bloodshed is horrific but also poetic in hands of director Francis Ford Coppola, who only came close again with 'Apocalypse Now.'Jame Caan is Sonny, the other of the godfather's sons. Sonny is brutal and the opposite of Michael, who has just graduated college but is lured into a life of crime by circumstance. The highlight is a baptism used as a counterpoint to a massacre simultaneously. Just sit back an watch the unmatched Brandon devour the screen.",9,1,4,29 February 2012
