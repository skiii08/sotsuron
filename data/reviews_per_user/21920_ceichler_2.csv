Requiem for a Dream," This 'Dream' Falls Flat
","Having just read the book and the reviews, I eagerly awaited seeing this film.  Alas, I was very disappointed! The film made an attempt to reach the inner core of the novel but in doing so it lacked focus, characterization, emotional content,acting choices and a general sense of the confusion the novel suggested.  Visually the film lacked the subtlety needed to suggest a drowning in the maelstrom the character fell into.  Special eefects were admirable but detracted from any sense of story-telling.  even though the novel is written through a stream-of consciousness flavor that I enjoyed, the film fell flat in suggesting the increasing horror the characters face. The only redeeming scene with any flavor of the book was the altercation between Harry and Sara about her addiction. I would much rather feel the flavor of destitution inflicted in such films as 'Midnight Cowboy' or even 'Transpotting' than the bleak dimmensions of this film.",Null,0,1,22 December 2000
Pi," Attack of Jitters
","I consider myself an above average film-goer. In fact I teach film.  But what is this movie all about?  I have no idea.  It reminds me of Ken Russell directing Donald Duck in math land.  I watched the whole movie but where was it going?  If anyone can unriddle the secrets of 'Pi', let me know.",Null,4,5,18 November 2000
