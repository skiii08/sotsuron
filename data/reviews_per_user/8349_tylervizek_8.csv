Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," give it a couple watches.
","Ok so first time I watched I thought it was way too long and so underwhelming. That was until the last 30 minutes of the movie. It's like what in the hell just happened...I was speechless. I was giddy. I was blown away. You could even say I was somewhat aroused. I didn't know how to feel after the movie. I was ready to turn to one of my buddies and say 'that sucked'. I knew I needed a re watch immediately. This time knowing more of the backstory, I went in excited. Main goal was to appreciate the first 2 hours more. 20 minutes in to the re watch I fell in love. Leo and Brad had great chemistry that doesn't go unnoticed and they're both hot. This is my longest review by far but this is how great this movie really is. 2 watches folks. Once you do that, you're going to want to keep watching.",10,12,15,11 December 2019

Joker," Hey man this movie is good
","Yes, yes it is. Just based off the fact they're playing Sinatra half the movie was darn good enough for me. I believe Juaquin and Phillips nailed it. A lot of ppl will dislike this movie I bet. Probably offends them in some way. Well then don't watch if you're one of those people.",10,4,8,11 December 2019
