The Equalizer," Denzel does what he does best...
","I really enjoyed 'The Equalizer'. Denzel gives a fine performance as the cool-as-ice professional who sorts out the bad guys, and 'equalizes' the equation. It's a role we've seen him do before in 'Man on Fire', and he gives a seasoned performance again here. The action was well paced, and the story built nicely to a satisfying climax. Certainly the story was somewhat predictable, with the final outcome all but inevitable, but if you like films where good triumphs over evil, and does so violently (ala 'Taken (2008)', 'Leon: The Professional (1994)), then this film will not disappoint. My only real criticism, and this is really nit-picking, was the song during the final credits. I'll say up front that I'm not an Eminem fan, but I found the lyrics distasteful and 'singing'irritating. Just my opinion, but it left an unfortunate final impression. 8/10",8,1,3,12 December 2014
X-Men," Still waiting for the payoff
","Let me say up front, that I'm not a devotee of the X-Men comic book series, and knew very little about the story prior to watching the film. However, I was anxious to see 'X-Men' the movie, as it had received a lot of publicity during it's theatrical release, and the trailers for it looked enticing. After watching the movie on DVD, I was impressed with the special effects, and the surround sound employed, but the story left much to be desired. The idea of a race of mutants living amongst us, and possessing extraordinary powers has a lot of potential. I felt however, that a much of that potential was wasted by the seemingly lacklustre story. It certainly seemed as though the premise of this film was simply to introduce the characters and then create the setting for a (hopefully better) sequel. For me, the lack of resolution in this movie, made it seem too much like a 'part1', rather than a movie capable of standing on it's own merits. Watch it and see for yourself. Definitely worth a look on a rainy Saturday, if only for the FX.5/10",6,0,0,19 January 2001
The Patriot," Entertaining, but ultimately unbalanced and unsatisfying.
","I had fairly high hopes prior to watching this movie for the first time. I actually enjoy 'period' films, and American history is a particular favorite.So I was very disappointed with 'The Patriot'. I felt that the director simply overlaid a generic story onto the Revolutionary War theme, and did so in a very unbalanced, black and white manner. I don't want to restate the many views already expressed, so I'll just say that my main objection to this film, was the way it assumes the viewing public are all simpletons. For example, why was it necessary for the director to bludgeon us with his obvious bias against the British in this film? I mean, how many atrocities did he require Col.Tavington to commit before he ensured that everyone in the audience was baying for British blood? Come on Mr Emmerich, haven't you ever heard of subtlety?Apart from the black and white nature of the whole picture, there were far too many totally unrealistic scenes. Are we really to believe that Benjamin Martin and his two young boys could so easily despatch an entire company of British soldiers?What a shame that what could (and should have) been a balanced, stirring narrative on an important period of America's history, was ultimately reduced to such formulaic Hollywood fluff. I sincerely hope that another studio/director revisits the topic, and does it right. As always, I suppose it all comes down to making a film that will score big at the box office, versus making a film that will actually mean something long after the movie posters for it have been torn down. If you like American period films, give 'Dances with Wolves' a go - it's far superior!6/10",6,25,49,11 January 2001
Insidious," Less than stellar
","I am a big fan of horror films, and have seen many over the years. I had heard good things about Insidious before sitting down to watch it, so I did have slightly high expectations going in. I must admit, the first half of the film was reasonably effective and did a good job of setting the scene for some decent scares. Yes, elements of the story have mostly been seen before, but I was still enjoying the movie. Unfortunately the story started to get rather silly during the second half, and the whole 'astral travel' thing left me a little disappointed. However the worst feature of this film for me were the ghosts themselves - they just weren't that scary. I mean from the Darth Maul look- alike to the ugly bride with a seriously bad makeup job, I was not so much scared as I was amused. I almost laughed out loud. Not good. For a film that held such initial promise, I was left shaking my head when the credits finally rolled. Not the worst horror film by a long stretch, but it could (and should) have been so much better. If you are after an effective scary film may I suggest any of the following; The Exorcist, The Grudge, The Changeling (George C Scott), The Others or The Descent. 7/10",7,0,0,30 June 2011
From Dusk Till Dawn," Violent escapism ... entertaining
","First and foremost, 'Dusk till dawn' is not a film for those averse to violence. This is a VERY violent movie. That said, it's also quite entertaining, provided you are prepared to put aside any preconceptions about the storyline. The story revolves around the exploits of two extremely nasty brothers (Clooney and Tarantino), who will stop at nothing to escape justice, following a bank holdup. There are seemingly senseless acts of brutality committed from the outset, which serves to build a sense of revulsion for these two. After highjacking a family as hostages and fleeing into Mexico, the pair arrive at a truckers bar where the whole story takes a major turn. It's at this point that most people will decide to either love or hate this film. I chose the former. I've watched the DVD a few times now, and find the image quality to be excellent, apart from slight over coloration. The audio is equally satisfying. Sadly, there are very few additional features on the DVD. In summary, I recommend this film to fans of the action/horror genre ... just be prepared to check your incredulity at the door. 8/10",8,0,0,30 August 1999
The Matrix Reloaded," Heavy on eye candy, light on substance
","Those expecting to be 'blown away' by 'Matrix Reloaded' may be a bit disappointed by this hugely hyped sequel. I came away feeling that the major focus was on style and effects, rather than substance. While there is no doubting that the computer gurus earned their keep on this film, I felt the fight sequences were far too numerous and too lengthy, almost to the point of tedium. Importantly, the element which made the original 'Matrix' so memorable, the incredible concept of a computer generated world in which we are all prisoners, was not well expanded upon in MR. Instead the storyline seems convoluted and needlessly complicated, and the depictions of Zion altogether too superficial. While I accept that the first priority of any film is to entertain it's audience, I think the directors got carried away with the action side of things, and once the credits began to roll (to a hugely annoying thrash music soundtrack), the overall sense I was left with is disappointment at what could have been a great film. In summary, the brothers Wachowski have failed to capitalize on the greatest strength of the original film, it's marvelous story, opting instead to concentrate on special effects, super-hero style costumes and episodic fight sequences. Disappointing. I certainly won't be queuing up to see the next installment. 7/10.",7,0,0,18 May 2003
