It," this isnt entertainment
",With all the madness in the world all you need is movies like 'it' to cherry the cake. This is not entertainment. This is like skimming the gunk to get something good out of it.,1,0,1,19 December 2017
Avengers: Endgame," Everything is possible
",The movie picks storyline at its own convenience. Impossible things become possible at the noise orchestra. My biggest complain is that there is no coherence especially how do you quantity powers of these super heroes ? Just hit smash and do it all over again.,1,58,101,28 April 2019
