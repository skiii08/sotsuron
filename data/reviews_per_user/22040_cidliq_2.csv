The Avengers," Solid fun movie
","THE GOOD- I was truly impressed with how well they pulled this movie off. The visual effects were all very clean. The characters were portrayed by the actors very well. This movie was loaded with action keeping everyone's attention glued to it. I was so impressed, I went to the theater to see it more than once and recommended it to everyone. I was very happy to see most of the actors return to portray their characters in this. THE BAD- Most characters.... The hulk was my big issue here. Mark Rufflo was good with the Bruce Banner character but the graphics for the hulk just did not meet the level of the movie starring Edward Norton. But it was not so bad that I could not look past it and really find enjoyment. I will most definitely go see another installment of Avengers.",9,28,53,6 July 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," It was good, some changes could have made it great.
",The Amazing Spiderman was visually very beautiful. What was really wonderful is how well they stuck to the actual comic story line. The actors in this installment are far more believable in their rolls vs. the cast of Spiderman.(IE Tobey and Kristen) The bad on this movie was the whole back story. The other spiderman movies had established a back story for the character. some minor differences would have to be spelled out but this could have been completed in less time than what they used. The whole front end of the movie moved pretty slowly. The last half of the movie however was most excellent. I would like to see another installment of The Amazing Spiderman now that the pain of back story's has been completed. (fingers crossed),4,2,6,6 July 2012
