Requiem for a Dream," Speechless for Days
","Generally, after watching a movie, there is a discussion held between me and my boyfriend. This movie left us with nothing to say.That is not to say it is a bad thing. In fact, I would almost say it is a good thing. They closed up the movie well, and there was nothing to be confused about. It was consistent, and clean - all while showing the violence and abuse that comes with drugs.Don't expect to be smiling at the end of this movie. Do not, by any means, expect to jump up raving about this movie to all you know. Its powerful, with little dialogue, and you don't really know WHAT to say about it.Which leads me to this-Dreams are a powerful thing.That is my only real comment... you just have to see it for yourself. Once again, not for the faint of heart.OH!!! And (sorry) I loved how the avoided showing the actual use of heroin, thats what turned me off of Trainspotting - but in this movie, it is creatively done so that you can stomach if if you don't appreciate needles.I didn't know what to give this movie - but after 3 days of thinking about it, I give it a 10/10. And as one man in the comments forum said 'it should be shown in high schools'",Null,0,0,12 June 2001
Ali," 50 Min Into the Film...
","I have been watching this film for 50 minutes and there is no story. If I am absolutely bored to tears tomorrow, maybe I will consider finishing it. The film itself is visually pleasing. The script is lacking in so many ways I can not begin to explain. For now, I would rather be sleeping.",2,0,2,3 May 2002
Training Day," Good Cop Bad Cop Drivel
","Let's just hand out Oscars to every actor who plays a one dimensional tough guy. Hawke steals the show (what show there was to steal),a fundamentally pointless plot, with a predictable ending.**SPOILER**I think Denzel Washington's acting skills shone most in the very last scene - flailing like an epileptic while bullets passed through him. Simply hilarious.",3,11,22,2 April 2002
Full Metal Jacket," Not for the faint of heart
","I suppose there isn't much I can say about this movie that hasn't already said.The one thing I take from this movie, and its realism, is that the women who go to war, are much stronger, and should be more respected than they are.
A wonderful portrait. 9/10",Null,0,0,8 June 2001
Bridget Jones's Diary," Absolutely a GREAT Movie...
","How rare it is that a chick flick gets meshed so well with a movie that a guy could watch without finding himself desiring to make little men out of cheese doodles.This movie was hilarious, and at the same time sweet. Women can relate and men can laugh. It really is a great movie.I was hesitant to bother with it, and would never have subjected my boyfriend to it, but now that I have seen it, I would actually go so far as to say its ownable.Renee is wonderful, Hugh played a fabulous slime ball and the real star of the show was the guy who played the keeper.. Name? I can't remember! I was too enthralled in the end scene.Its the opening scene that was the stealer though, any woman can relate, and men can have a little view of our little insanities.9/10 no half marks allowed.",9,0,0,18 October 2001
