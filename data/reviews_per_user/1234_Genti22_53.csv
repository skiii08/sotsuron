Blade Runner 2049," A masterpiece if there ever was one
","Blade Runner 2049 expands upon the very intriguing world that the first Blade Runner movie back in 1982 presented. What is also does is that is surpasses the original in every possible way. This is easily one of the, if not the actual best movie of 2017. The visuals are revolutionary and the acting is all around great.
So happy that films like this are still being made and I am certainly rooting for a third Blade Runner film in the near future.",10,4,11,12 March 2018
First Man," Out of this world
","First Man is a very well made movie about the journey of Neil Armstrong to the Moon and back. Damien Chazelle proves once again that he is a master at directing, and him working with Ryan Gosling, is always a win.
The visual effects were incredible, the ending got me feeling very emotional, as the movie is not just about the journey to the Moon, but it takes its time to tell a personal story about a man who gave up so much to complete this mission.
One of the best movies of 2018, and a very worthy Oscar contender.",10,0,1,29 December 2018
Skyfall," One of the best Bond films ever.
","Skyfall is one of the best action movies ever,and one of the best James Bond movies also.The only real competition here is Casino Royal as they go tie to tie and they are both really awesome. Now the most perfect thing about this movie is the way it is shot,because the cinematography is gorgeous,and so well shot. The action also looks great,brilliantly shot,with camera angles that make it possible to see what's going on all the time and stay in touch with the movie. I really like Daniel Craig as James Bond,for me he is the best Bond ever,as he brings some style and freshness to the long existing character.What truly impressed me is Javier Bardem here,as he is outstanding and great to look at on screen.He owns his role,and makes for a perfect and one of the best villains of the Bond saga. Another really impressive feat here is the soundtrack.Thomas Newman does a great job,with this movie and so does Adele with her song of the same name.Even the sound effects are near perfect. Skyfall stands out as an astonishing achievement as an action/spy movie and as a Bond one.",10,3,10,30 December 2015
A Star Is Born," Compelling
","Bradley Cooper has officially proven himself as one of the best actors to work today, and Lady Gaga is absolutely captivating with her acting as well.
I loved what this film had to offer and the ending just completely broke me. The ride throughout the film is at times heartbreaking and at times joyful. This is a film that will be remembered for ages, also Shallows is one of my fave songs of the year as well. I loved it and I would recommend it to anyone who loves art.",9,2,4,26 November 2018
Captain Marvel," Marvellous
","Captain Marvel is an awesome new addition to the ever-growing MARVEL Universe, and the superhero immediately became one of my favourites from the MCU. Brie Larson does a wonderful job on the portrayal of Carol Danvers, she is very inspiring on the role. I love the entire cast of the movie, the duo of Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson totally make the film, with witty back and forth and interesting character growth all the way through.
Also, some of the twists that came through the second half of the movie I did not see coming. In my opinion this is a great superhero movie, with a great origin story for Captain Marvel, and I am so excited to see her on Endgame.
Captain Marvel is now the 10th highest grossing superhero movie of all time, and still going strong, proud of her.",8,1,13,25 March 2019
Zootopia," Disney proves that anything they touch, turns to perfection.
","Zootopia is an animated buddy-cop comedy mystery film directed by Byron Howard and Rich Moore. The screenplay is written by Jared Bush, Phil Jonston and on the main voice-role stars Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, Jenny Slate, Nate Torrence, Bonnie Hunt, Don Lake, Tommy Chong, J. K. Simmons, Octavia Spencer, Alan Tudyk, and Shakira. Zootopia is a place where all animals, prey and predator live in peace and harmony. A rabbit named Judy Hops dreams of becoming the first rabbit cop ever and on her journey to her dream she runs into a fox, named Nick Wilde. Together they will try to solve a mystery about some missing predator civilians on the city of Zootopia. I personally loved this film and its message with all my heart. I was in tears by the end of the film just because of how beautiful/creative and well done the message about living in peace and together even though we may be different in race and/or other things (e.g. religion, gender etc). The animation is incredible to look at, this movie is an undeniable visual treat every second of it. It is also very funny and references a lot of other famous movies and TV Shows (Breaking Bad). Kids will have a good time marveling at the beautiful animation and the really likable characters, but I feel like adults will be the ones to enjoy this movie the most. The message that comes across is timeless and very much necessary at this point and time. All the voice work is amazing, Ginnifer Goodwin does a fantastic job on the lead role and Jason Bateman delivered that slick fun tone throughout his likable character. The music is composed by the talented Michael Giacchino, who has been very busy recently composing pretty much every amazing soundtrack on a lot of successful movies. He also does a very good job here, with his composition that delivers what is required on certain scenes. This is one fast paced, interesting, funny and feel good animated film that Disney seems to have become masters at making recently. I did not find anything wrong with it all throughout the film, and it is definitely one of my favorite films of 2016 so far.",10,11,22,4 September 2016
Creed," A personal struggle filled with incredible performances.
","Creed is the seventh film on the Rocky franchise,directed by Ryan Coogler and stars Michael B. Jordan as Adonis Johnson the son of Apollo Creed,Sylvester Stallone returning to play Rocky Balboa and Tessa Thompson as Bianca. Creed follows Adonis Johnson,who's father (Apollo Creed) died before he was born.However he loves to box and one day he decides to seek out Rocky Balboa to train him.Rocky sees Apollo in Adonis and agrees to train him,even though he battles a deadly opponent but with Rocky's help he will train and try to make a name for himself not just depend on his father's. This movies,much like Rocky (1976),it's not concentrated on the boxing as much as in the characters.Adonis Johnson is played wonderfully by Michael B. Jordan who is definitely Oscar worthy with this performance.Adonis is trying to prove that he was not just a mistake and show the world that he can fight.He goes through a lot of struggle but with the help of Rocky he will try to overcome his fears and be better at what he does. Sylvester Stallone is magnificent on the iconic role again.He proves that The Expendables it's not all he does and he is worthy of a lot more. One of the first professional fights on the ring that Adonis has it's been made to look as one-shot take and it's brilliant.I really loved that scene and even more than the final battle. I really like the personal struggles that the characters have to go through,the way they overcome them and the dialogue between the two main characters it's really good and sometimes even touching.I was tearing up in a few scenes and the amazing soundtrack coordinating with the lines of the dialogue made for some pretty intense/sad scenes. I really liked Creed,it's certainly one of the best movies of the year and worthy of many awards.",10,3,6,29 December 2015
Spotlight," Masterful storytelling
","Spotlight is a biographical drama directed by Tom McCarthy and stars Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, John Slattery, Stanley Tucci, Brian d'Arcy James, Liev Schreiber, and Billy Crudup. The film follows Boston Globe's Spotlight team and its investigation into cases of widespread and systemic child sex abuse in the Boston area by numerous Roman Catholic priests. This is a masterpiece of a film, with incredible acting and a great true story to go along with it. The director Tom McCarthy totally got the story right and paid tribute to the amazing journalists while never making them look like people with superpowers or anything other than normal people tackling a story with weight for the good of everyone. Everybody does a fantastic job here, but Mark Ruffalo stood out to me the most from the bunch. He was amazing and was fully committed to the role from beginning to the end. Also the soundtrack by Howard Shore was Oscar worthy even though it wasn't even nominated on the category for some reason. Everything from the cinematography to the music and the editing builds up to an absolute masterpiece of a film that is created superbly for our eyes to enjoy and our minds to think.",10,0,0,22 September 2016
Thor: Ragnarok," Best Thor ever
","This is the best Thor has ever been. For people complaining about Thor making jokes and what not, those same people complained when Thor: The Dark World came out and it was more serious. 
The action is great, the acting is on point and the visuals are a treat. I love the interactions between the characters and the presence of Hulk in the movie just made it all the more fun and better. It is indeed a very funny movie with high stakes and one of the best MCU films to date, though I still like Spider-Man: Homecoming a bit more.",9,6,24,16 February 2018
The Hateful Eight," Spectacular and haunting
","The Hateful Eight is the 8th movie by the amazing Qunetin Tarantino and certainly one of his best yet.Tarantino wrote it and also directed it,and the cast includes Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Walton Goggins, Demi√°n Bichir, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, and Bruce Dern. The movie is set in post civil war time and it's about eight strangers who are travelling to Red Rock but a strong blizzard makes spend a few days at a stagecoach stopover located on a mountain pass.Soon they begin to be suspicious that one of them is not who he says he is and is going to kill them all as soon as he gets the chance to. This movie is terrific,and the cast is spectacular.This is one of the best performance from Samuel L. Jackson on a Tarantino film ever.Surprisingly Jennifer Jason Leigh is great too,since she is on a side role only,but nonetheless it's a stand out for her too.Walton Goggins is also very good on the role and memorable too. The cinematography is phenomenal by Robert Richardson and I'm so glad that Ennio Morricone won the long deserved Academy Award for the brilliant and mesmerizing/haunting score on this movie. I have heard a lot of negative buzz about this movie as well as controversy regarding some racial issues that some people seem to have with it and in my opinion is pointless and stupid.People must learn to appreciate art and amazing film making like this in order for the cinematic experience to be good. It is quite long but it certainly doesn't feel that way because it is not boring in any part what so ever.Quentin Tarantino is a genius filmmaker and I hope/pray that he will keep on making movies forever because he is a great director and one of the best that we've got working today.",10,3,9,6 March 2016
Moana," Absolute excellence by Disney AGAIN !!
","Moana (or Vaiana in my country and many other European countries) is an animated musical adventure directed by John Musker and Ron Clements. It is the second Disney movie this year after the incredible Zootopia that was released back in February, and now I can say it is the second incredible movie released by Disney in 2016. Moana is a very interesting and touching movie about a girl named Moana (Vaiana) who dreams of sailing the world. She is voiced by Auli'i Cravalho who does a fantastic job on the role with her insanely talented voice, singing all the wonderful songs that will very soon be considered as classics. Dwayne Johnson is great (as per usual) as Maui - a legendary shapeshifting demigod. He brings such a fun, lovely, and comforting voice to his character that very few actors can do. And he is great at singing too, which was a surprise for me. It also has great animation, with incredible visuals as we've come to expect in Disney movies nowadays. I truly believe that in this decade, Disney has absolutely taken over the reigns in the film industry, and especially on the animation side of things. With movies like Tangled, Wreck-it Ralph, Frozen, Big Hero 6, Zootopia and now Moana, Disney shows no sign of stopping in their road to greatness and taking over the world.",10,36,79,27 November 2016
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Marvel know their stuff
","I am a DC fan at heart, but Marvel since 2008 has been killing the game with one incredible movie after another, and Spider-Man: Homecoming is no exception. 
Tom Holland does a fantastic job as Spidey and especially as Peter. The inclusion of Tony Stark does not feel forced at all, and no one can actually complain about seeing more of Robert Downey Jr, as Tony and Iron Man.
This is the best comic book movie of 2017 in my opinion, it has great action and a good story. Everything is well done and I can't wait for the sequel.",10,17,29,20 January 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Unpredictable
","I enjoyed this movie all the way through, the acting is terrific and it might be one of the best acted movies ever made. The story is unpredictable and the ending might not satisfy everyone but I liked it. I am glad it is nominated for many Oscars including Best Picture because it deserves it.",9,4,8,28 February 2018
Forrest Gump," Inspiring generations
",All I could possibly say about this film it's that it is easily one of the best movies ever made and that it is my dream that one day I will be able to make something of my own that might resemble this masterpiece.,10,1,3,20 October 2018
Ant-Man," Marvel continues to shine
","Ant-Man is a 2015 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics characters of the same name,It is the 12th movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.The film is directed by Peyton Reed and stars Paul Rudd,Evangeline Lilly,Corey Stoll,Bobby Cannavale, Michael Pe√±a,Tip 'T.I.' Harris,Anthony Mackie,Wood Harris,Judy Greer,David Dastmalchian and Michael Douglas. In Ant-Man, Lang must help defend Dr. Pym's Ant-Man shrinking technology and plot a heist with worldwide ramifications. Paul Rudd plays Scott Lang,a burglar who breaks into houses and steals stuff.He was arrested many times but now he's decided to change.Rudd is amazing in the role,he's such a nice and welcome edition to the Marvel hero canon.He's funny,charismatic and committed to the role. Michael Douglas as Hank Pym though is what makes this movie even more amazing that it already is.He is so great on the role and it's so nice to see him actually act again.Even his backstory is truly interesting and I would love to see a prequel all about him. Evangeline Lilly as Hope van Dyne is also very good.I like that she's a strong character and does not necessarily depend on others,I really like where they are going with her character and I'm super excited to see her back in the sequel. The visual effects for this movie are mind-blowing and truly impressive.I really enjoyed the action sequences especially his final throw downs with Jellowjacket.The scope of the battles and the way they decided to direct and present them made me laugh out loud in so many occasions,especially the scene already seen in the trailers with Tomas the Train,which is hilarious and perfectly shot. There are a few story lines in this film,one of them being Scott and his daughter.I liked that story line despite most of the people saying that it felt forced and only put in the movie to make us care more about Scott Lang.I disagree actually because it absolutely did make us care but it also gave the character a reason to wear the Ant-Man suit and it truly worked. The villain in this movie (portrayed by Corey Stoll) is also a complain that I've heard quiet a lot.I disagree here also because in my opinion his intentions and motives from his back story are truly interesting and believable.I also truly liked Corey Stoll's performance and the yellowjacket suit looked glorious.He makes up for some really good looking and overall interesting fights with Ant-Man. The movie faced some problems along the production,it changed directors as it was once going to be directed by Edgar Wright but his concepts and basic story did not fit in with the MCU so they changed it and that is totally fine with me.I liked Peyton Reed's directing and style and I also like the humor in it,most of it being delivered by Michael Pe√±a who every time he talks it's just comedy gold and I was laughing so much. I truly enjoyed Ant-Man,it is a nice and pretty different addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe,with the scale of the movie being much smaller (pun intended) and it being first and foremost a heist movie.",10,2,6,19 December 2015
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," Funny all the way through.
","Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is a musical mockumentary directed by Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone. The film stars Andy Samberg on the lead role as the popstar and co-stars Sarah Silverman, Tim Meadows, Imogen Poots, Joan Cusack and Maya Rudolph. This movie is basically a satire of the celebrity life (Justin Bieber much ?) and the way that famous people react to falling from grace among other things. I personally really liked this film, it was incredibly funny all the way through and Andy Samberg does a fantastic job on the role here. He's actually really funny and we're once again reminded of his talent. The soundtrack is also unbelievably amazing, all the songs have a really catchy beat and funny lyrics that just replay on your head for a long time after hearing them. It does drag on for quite a bit unfortunately even though it is only 86 minutes it felt like much longer. Also the movie is filled with clich√©s but I guess that is not the point of the film because it was never trying to shy away from them or be something ground breaking. It is just a fun flick to watch when you have free time and I appreciate it for that.",8,0,2,29 August 2016
Bohemian Rhapsody," Absolutely rocking
","I loved this film from the very first seconds to the last. I am a big Queen fan and this movie to me at least, does justice to the amazing and one of the best singers ever, Freddie Mercury.
Rami Malek to me has already won the Oscar for the Best Actor, and honestly every other actor in the film is really good.
The cinematography is incredible, direction is great and the story they told was captivating as it does get deep and emotional at times.
Freddie Mercury and Queen will live on forever and this movie will be a classic in time.
Additionally, the end scene at the Live Aid is so much fun I was singing to it a lot.
Watch it, Bohemian Rhapsody will rock you.",9,3,4,9 November 2018
Baby Driver," Thrilling
","Baby Driver is a very thrilling and captivating action film, with Ansel Elgort doing a phenomenal job on the lead. I loved every moment of it, the camerawork is incredible, so is the editing. Also loved the music, and just how much that felt like a character in itself. 
Definitely one of the best of the year and it deserved to be nominated more than just for 3 Oscars.",9,1,3,28 January 2018
Justice League," Incredible fun
","I am a big DC fan, actually just a superhero fan in general. I am glad that so many comic book movies are coming out every year and we get to enjoy both DC and MARVEL movies. The characters included are great especially The Flash who is very funny. 
What they did with Superman is genius and I loved every bit of it. In my opinion DCEU is doing a good job so far and I can't wait to see more.",5,3,10,11 February 2018
The Revenant," One of the year's best
","The Revenant is one of the best movies as far as cinematography goes.The natural shots they were able to take are amazing and mesmerizing.The visuals are beyond perfect and that 'Bear scene' is so great that it's hard to believe how they were able to do it.The movie is gritty and also intense while still being very interesting and gorgeously shot with top notch performances and directing. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of the best,if not the best performance of the year by a male in a leading role and I truly hope that this time he actually gets to win an Oscar for this.He's so committed to the role and it shows especially in some of the more brutal scenes. Tom Hardy also nails the role perfectly and gives almost an equally great performance as Leo.His voice is weird though but by now we're used to him having different voices on different roles,even though sometimes is hard to understand what he's saying. It does get brutal though and some of the things that the characters have to do to survive are beyond disgusting but reasonable and understandable for the situations they're in. The soundtrack is also very good but it's not what you take away from the movie the most,because the amazing cinematography and the style of the movie,the direction that Alejandro G.I√±√°rritu goes including here the two amazing performances of the leads are what you take away the most about this amazing cinematic achievement. At 153 minutes it is a bit too long but that doesn't take away from the movie that much because this still remains as one of the best movies of the year with some of the best performances,cinematography,visuals a really good score and memorable scenes that are bound to stick in your mind for a long time after.",10,21,61,25 December 2015
Captain America: Civil War," Marvel are on a roll.
","Captain America Civil War is the thirteenth film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, with a screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely. In Captain America: Civil War, disagreement over international oversight of the Avengers fractures them into opposing factions - one led by Steve Rogers and the other by Tony Stark. Civil War is definitely one of the best Marvel movies to date, and absolutely on par with The Winter Soldier which was also great. They are both on top in the Marvel Cinematic Movies ranking of mine so far. The conflict between these well beloved characters is done in a brilliant and fantastic way by the amazing Russo brothers who took the cheese out of the first Captain America movie , made one serious and great second movie, and build upon them both with the third outing. Everyone does a great job here, Chris Evans has made Captain America his own same as Robert Downey Jr for Iron Man. It features a very big ensemble cast and not one of them is anything less than great on the role. The fight scenes are also some of the best ever made in a comic book movie, even better than in The Winter Soldier. Especially the airport scene is just mesmerizing and totally stands out from everything else that's going on. Spider-Man is also unbelievably well done and Tom Holland is just fantastic. I am one of the few people who actually loved The Amazing Spider Man movies, and really got mad to hear that they are going to reboot the character again but I can see now that it was worth it. The visuals are great from beginning to end, the music is also good as usual. The villain is something that most people though it was the weakest point but I strongly disagree with that. He had reasoning as to why he is doing those things, and he pushes the other characters in new directions which is also necessary. I generally adored this movie, and even though I am a DC fan, there's just no denying that Marvel knows what they're doing and that is why they are much more successful right now.",10,60,113,14 May 2016
The Conjuring 2," Actual great horror
","The Conjuring 2 is a direct sequel to the first Conjuring and is once again directed by James Wan. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are back on the leading roles as Ed and Lorraine Warren, the paranormal investigators. Also stars Frances O'Connor, Madison Wolfe, Simon McBurney, Franka Potente and Lauren Esposito among others. The film is based on the true story, that follows Ed and Lorraine Warren trying to help a family with their problems with paranormal forces in Brimsdown, Enfield council house in 1977, what is their most documented paranormal case ever. This is one of the best horror movies ever made in my opinion, and it is much better than the first film which I also really liked. What this movie does is benefit from a great horror director who clearly knows how to inject good scares with amazing use of camera- work and tension building that result to thrilling scenes and make for a great movie overall. All of the actors do a fantastic job, with Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga on the lead who have great chemistry with each other and make us really feel for their characters when stuff with the demons is going down. Also, Madison Wolfe gives one of the best kid performances on screen ever. She is just brilliant and carries entire scenes on her own, with her amazing gifted ability to act and it might just be me but she is totally Oscar worthy here. Much better than all the kids in Stranger Things combined, even though I know that's a TV Shows by comparison, but just on the acting scale of things she deserves much more recognition for this role . Since the movie is over two hours, by the end it does feel like it is going on for a bit too long, and the ending in itself is a bit too much in the sense that the way they defeat the demon and resolve the case felt like cheating to me. But either way those are the only small issues that I have with this wonderful film which I loved and I can't wait to see what's in store for this universe.",7,1,2,5 September 2016
Inside Out," One of the best animated movies of all time.
","Inside Out is the newest Pixar movie and also one of their best ever,which clearly means that this movie is something special. This movie is about Riley,an 11 year old girl from Minnesota who loves Hockey and lives happily with her mom and dad.But everything falls apart when they move to San Francisco,where she has to deal with a new house,and new school where she needs to make new friends and her emotions Joy,Sadness,Fear,Anger and Disgust guide her through these life changing events.Though,affected by these changes,Sadness makes a few mistakes that end up with her and Joy,into the far reaches of Riley's mind and with only Fear,Anger and Disgust left to the head quarters to guide Riley and to try and maintain positive thinking. First off to begin with,the emotions and their voice cast in this movie is all around perfect.Starting with Joy,voiced by Amy Poehler,Fear by Bill Hader,Disgust by Mindy Kaling,Anger by Lewis Black and Sadness by Phyllis Smith.They all do a masterful job in here,giving the right voice 'emotion' to their emotions. Pete Docter is the director of this movie,he previously directed Monsters Inc,which I truly love,and Up,which is my all time favorite animated movie.This guy is a genius at this.He has mastered the art of the animation so well now that everything he does,its perfect. I really liked the way the world inside the mind was presented.I think they found new and interesting ways to show that to us and to impress us.The animation is gorgeous as every other Pixar movie ever,but what makes this movie great,it is the story,that its special and amazing.It is also very funny and will most certainly brings tears of joy (literally) to those who watch it. Kids should see this movie,because they will have fun and marvel at the animation,and laugh at the jokes in it.They will also learn about emotions and about what makes us human as a whole.But quiet frankly,in my opinion this movie is targeted more to adults,because of its thematic and interesting plot and I am pretty sure that adults will get the best of this movie,which is a weird thing to say about an animation,but then again,this is Pixar and you can except anything from these miracle workers. I honestly cried like 3 times in this movie,which is to be expected from this director,after that truly sad and masterpiece of a movie that he made before this,Up,and from what I heard,a lot of people cried also which is an astonishing achievement for the crew. I read an article on how Psychiatrists around the world are really loving this movie,which can clearly tell you just how amazing and well thought Inside Out is.They are saying that kids should definitely see this movie and that it can teach them a lot about emotions which is a hard thematic discussion to have for adults with their children. This is a stunning and original movie,also by far the best Pixar movie since Toy Story 3,and in my opinion,in Top 3 of all time Pixar movies.Everyone should watch this movie and I hope that it gets nominated for Best Picture,as Pixar's two earlier movies (Up and Toy Story 3).",10,12,45,30 December 2015
Avengers: Endgame," Culmination
","Avengers: Endgame is a culmination of 11 years of cinematic superhero movies that have entertained us on different levels all throughout the years. 22 movies come to an explosive ending here and if the word 'epic' ever had any meaning, this movie would be it. Truly a visceral experience that leaves you heartbroken and shocked from all the events and the insane number of characters and story-lines that they intervene.
I loved pretty much everything about this movie, it was indeed a bit slow at the start but I didn't mind as the ending is probably the most spectacular thing I have ever experienced in a cinema.
Everyone does an amazing job at acting, but my stand out would be Jeremy Renner who truly shines as Hawkeye. The Russo brothers have accomplished an incredible feat and the entire 181 minutes of this film, serve as minutes that will go down in the history of cinema for decades to come.",9,2,7,24 April 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," An absolute joy to witness
","All throughout these ten years everything has been building up to this movie, and it surely does pay off big time. The action is incredible and the characters are so well used, it gets the plot moving constantly. Thanos is fantastic as the villain, and certainly the best MCU villain ever. Definitely one of the best superhero films ever made, and a total joy to be able to see it on the big screen.",10,1,4,1 June 2018
Room," Perfect is the best word to describe 'Room'
","Room is directed by Lenny Abrahamson and stars Brie Larson, Jacob Tremblay, Joan Allen, Sean Bridgers, and William H. Macy. The film is about a woman named Joy 'Ma' Newsome who was abducted and held captive in a room for seven years, and her son, Jack who is five years old and has been living inside that particular room his entire life. The film follows their attempt at escaping from that place and as we see through Jack's eyes, his experience of the outside world for the first time in his life. This is definitely at the top of my best movies of the year, simply because it is incredibly done and perfectly portrayed. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay give some of the best performances I've ever seen in my life in any movie what so ever. The kid, Jacob, is phenomenal and surprisingly he carries it all throughout. You'd think that an amazing actress like Brie, and her character would be the center of the movie but that's actually not the case. As she says so in the movie, her kid saves her many times, and that goes to show just how different and amazingly done this movie really is. The director (Lenny Abrahamson) also did a very good job here, as he kept us interested and entertained through the first part of the movie when they're in the room. That is really hard to do, considering that there are not much things to do or a lot of different ways to go about it but this director did it. The music composed by Stephen Rennicks is very touching and gives those very much needed and present emotional moments meaning and heart. I think that one of the main reasons as to why this movie worked so wonderfully well was the screenplay written by the author of the original book that this movie is based upon, Emma Donoghue. More movies should take notice of this and be loyal to the main source because that's the best way to succeed at making an adaptation. I pretty much loved everything about this movie, it was touching, filled with incredible performances, very good cinematography, great directing that conclude to the perfectness that this movie is.",10,0,1,24 April 2016
Call Me by Your Name," Very moving
","Call Me By Your Name is a very moving and interesting film which focuses on the human soul and the search for love. Just like Moonlight last year, I think this movie might very well does deserve to win Best Picture at the Oscars. The performances are great, the soundtrack is fantastic and the directing is top notch. I thoroughly enjoyed this film from beginning to end and I hope they do make a sequel.",10,1,7,3 March 2018
X-Men: Apocalypse," Good and interesting all the way through
","X -Men: Apocalypse is a superhero film and the ninth installment on the X-Men film series. It is directed by Brian Singer with a screenplay by Simon Kinberg. It stars James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar Isaac, Nicholas Hoult, Rose Byrne, Tye Sheridan, Sophie Turner, Olivia Munn and Lucas Till. In Apocalypse, the ancient mutant En Sabah Nur awakens in 1983 and plans to wipe out modern civilization and take over the world, leading the X-Men to try to stop him and defeat his team of renegade mutants. I personally loved this movie from beginning to the end. I started to get emotionally invested from the Magneto scene in the woods, and from then on it was just a thrill ride. The acting is absolutely great from everyone, starting with the always amazing Michael Fassbender, who is exceptional on the role as always. The newcomers all do a really good job with the stand out, Sophie Turner who definitely does not disappoint in the iconic role. Apocalypse, played by Oscar Isaac who is taking over the world by storm (in this movie quiet literally), looks really good on screen, and the acting by Oscar is fine and serviceable. What irritated me the most were the special effects, which certainly could and should have been better. Even First Class had better effects than Apocalypse, I mean it's not all bad, there are scene that are great to look at but sometimes it just lost me on all the obvious green screen. The music is undeniably good though, the main theme is great and memorable. It does also feel a bit too long, especially with all the leading up scenes, but overall this is a really well made and absolutely fun entry in the X-Men franchise. The new trilogy, First Class, Days of Future Past and Apocalypse, is most certainly one of the best superhero trilogies there are.",9,7,10,28 July 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," The (truly) Amazing Spider-Man !
","This could be the movie of the year for me definitely this movie is so amazing and so good I think a stupid rating 7.4 is so low it should have been beyond 8 but I rate it high mostly because of visual effects,Andrew Garfield+Emma Stone,Dane DeHaan's amazing play and the sadness in the end.This movie is funny is sad is amazing in every aspect. A.Garfield topped this movie no doubt the best Spider-Man movie ever and until now one of the best movies of this year it just couldn't be better. From what I watched this year this movie is far better than any one else except I am waiting to see Dawn of the Planes of the Apes to see if is any better but until now this one is the best one yet,",8,24,41,18 July 2014
Coco," The usual from Pixar
","Coco is an absolutely magical and beautiful movie from Pixar. I am so blessed to be living in an era where the people at Pixar are making movies every year. This movie is really touching, and incredibly animated. Everyone should see it and in my opinion it is easily one of the best movies of the year.",10,0,1,7 February 2018
Sing Street," A masterpiece
","Sing Street is a musical comedy-drama that's written, produced and directed by John Carney. On the lead it stars Lucy Boynton, Maria Doyle Kennedy, Jack Reynor, Kelly Thornton and Ferdia Walsh-Peelo. This movie is about a boy who lives with his two parents that are seemingly on the verge of breaking up, and they move him to a free state-school. There he falls for a girl who then he decides to create a band to impress her. This movie is much deeper than that, and I think it benefits from it a lot because this is one of the best films I have seen in a very long time. The acting is phenomenal from every single actor here, starting with Ferdia Walsh-Peelo on the lead as Conor Lalor who gives genuinely one of the best male performances of the year. Ferdia Walsh-Peelo as Raphina, the girl who Conor falls for, is also amazing. But who totally stood out to me was Conor's brother in the movie, Brendan portrayed by Jack Reynor. I can not believe that this is the same guy who was in Transformers: Age of Extinction. I remembered him instantly from that monstrosity but with every second passing with him on screen I was more and more impressed. The writer-director John Carney does a wonderful job here, from the camera-work to the incredible soundtrack that just stays with you long after you've seen this masterpiece. The life lessons are perfectly conveyed to the audience and the 'kid' in all of us. I am certainly not what would be considered as an 80's kid and I might have not got all the references but that did not stop me from enjoying the movie so much. I felt for the characters and let me just say that the ending is so emotional and works so well with the story that was being told, that completes this absolute masterpiece of a movie and I can't wait to watch it again.",10,1,2,5 September 2016
Brave," Just as good as ever.
","Brave is a 2012 animated comedy-fantasy film directed by Mark Andrews and Brenda Chapman.It is the 13th Pixar film,and certainly a great one as their previous. Brave follows Merida the daughter of Scottish King Fergus and Queen Elinor.She is a skilled archer who wants to make her own fate in life and pursue her own dreams.She is then forced to get married,as the tradition requires at a certain age but she is in her own mind and seeks help from a witch to change the fate and be her own person in life. This movie is amazing,from the glorious animation to the characters who are likable just as much as they are interesting.Merida is a strong female lead character who chooses her own path in life and makes her own decisions for herself.She has dreams and most importantly is 'brave' enough to pursue them till the very end.She's also smart and Kelly Macdonald's voice work just helps the cause with her amazing Scottish Accent. The story is very interesting and intriguing while still being emotional that gives depth to the characters.But it also has funny moments throughout,even though the finale is very dark and also even sad which in my opinion is great. People has been complaining about the twist over and over again and how it is more of a kids film than for adults,which Pixar is used to making.But I disagree because while it is an absolute treat for kids,it is also dark at times,it has adult jokes here and there and what's very important,it has character development at its finest.The place where Merida and different characters in the movie are at the beginning and where they end up is just brilliant and life changing.The lessons they learn through their adventures,them being good or bad,and the way that this movie teaches people that we can make our own fate if we are brave enough to follow our hearts,that makes for an unforgettable experience.",10,1,4,17 January 2016
Cold War," Nice piece of story
","I really liked the directors work in this film. All the camera movements, set designs, acting down to clothes and make-up were pretty darn good. Also the story is truly captivating and it does keep you hooked until the very end.
I think there have been many better films that have come out this year but that's not to say that this wasn't good as well.",7,2,6,5 December 2018
Avengers: Age of Ultron," A very well done and interesting movie.
","Avengers:Age of Ultron is one of the final movies in marvel phase 2 and while not as great as the first one,this movie is still very good. The action in this movie is truly spectacular and the visual effects are really good and believable throughout.This movie is filled with fighting sequences from the very beginning until the end.And I love all of them especially the end battle where the stakes are really high and a few emotional moments. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch are some of the new additions and they are very awesome and well done.I honestly thought that Quicksilver is not going to be good after what I saw on X-Men DOFP but he is great here too,and so is the actor who portrays him. I love the group talks,seeing them get mad at each other and hating/loving is just so much fun and interesting.Also this movie is filled with laughs and comedic moments everywhere,which I truly appreciate. As about the main villain,Ultron,in my opinion,he was very well done.I really liked him,and his sarcastic jokes.which I found funny every single time.He is mesmerizing and not forgettable at all.His intentions very understandable and the only problem with him was his creation,which felt rushed but besides that he is a very good villain. There are some things that don't quiet work here,and other things that they did which just feel like they are setting up for the next movies to come in the marvel universe,but these are small flaws and passable ones because this movie overall is very well done and interesting until the very end.",7,17,35,30 December 2015
The Dark Knight," Why The Dark Knight is one of the greatest movies ever made:
","BOX OFFICE: $1.05 billion dollars. $534 million dollars in US. Second Best of all time at the time of its opening in 2008.Best opening of all time with $158 million. REVIEWS (critical acclaim): 9.0/10 on IMDb.94% on Rotten Tomatoes.82/100 on Metacritic. Best Reviewed Superhero Movie of all time. AWARDS:103 Won-178 Nominated Also nominated for 8 Oscars and Won 2 including Best Supporting Actor for Heath Ledger. The Dark Knight it's actually the movie that redefined the Superhero genre and it is even considered as one of the best Crime Dramas also,which is insane for a movie like this. Christopher Nolan's direction is just impressive and very interesting.He handled the characters so good and made one of the best on-screen villains ever,though Heath Ledger's portrayal totally stands out as the Joker,also making it in my opinion one of the best performances ever.Not to be overlooked are the other performances such as Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent who gave a very very good performance and brought charisma and seriousness to Dent and respectively Two Face.Christian Bale in my opinion is the best Batman/Bruce Wayne of all time.Maggie Gyllenhaal is an improvement over Katie Holmes,the likes of Michael Cane and Morgan Freeman give very serious and great performances too. The action is so well handled and very well shot that keeps you intrigued/excited every time.But what stand out are the dialogue scenes,especially the best scene in the movie which is the Interrogation scene between The Joker and Batman.That scene tells us so much and we get a look/perspective at the Joker's world so well and what makes him scary/intimidating it's that what he says actually makes sense,it's true all of it. Plus the amazing transformation of Harvey Dent to Two Face it's mesmerizing.Seeing at what point he is at the beginning,fighting for justice in any way he can and how he ends up in the end,willing to kill Gordon's kids it's just insane but realistic and believable too.After that insanely amazing written scene in the Hospital between Dent and The Joker,we see his transformation making sense with the amazingly realistic dialogue. The Joker just wants to watch the world burn and this movie shows what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object.Every moment that Heath is in it's memorable and insanely good,but the fact of the matter is that even when he is not on-screen the movie is still interesting and just as good because it's smart and rewarding by giving justice to these characters that had not been done rightfully before. The less prepared you are, the greater will be the experience of Nolan's masterpiece. I could go on and on writing about every detail of this amazing movie achievement but I leave it at this because I think I have said enough.If you hate the movie,it's fine because maybe you don't like these sort of movies or you were expecting something else after all I mean every movie has haters.But no one can deny the fact that The Dark Knight is memorable,filled with great performances,action done right and great dialogue.√Ø¬ª¬ø",10,2,3,18 July 2014
Don't Breathe," Tense and interesting all the way through
","Don't Breathe is a horror film directed by Fede Alvarez and stars Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette, Daniel Zovatto and Stephen Lang. This is one of the best horror and intense movies to come out in a long time. It has a basic simple story which works so well in favor of the movie itself. The acting is great all around, with Jane Levy on the main role and the 'evil' presence on the film Stephen Lang who gives a terrific performance as a blind bad-ass old man. The music works so well with the intense sequences that the movie is presenting to us throughout, and despite it taking a while to start it has what you could consider as a perfect ending to this kind of movie. It is one of the best films of 2016 so far and certainly one of the better horrors to come in a while.",9,0,3,1 November 2016
The Witch," Masterpiece of a film
","The Witch is a historical period horror movie written and directed by Robert Eggers in his directorial debut. It stars Anya Taylor-Joy, Ralph Ineson, Kate Dickie, Harvey Scrimshaw, Ellie Grainger and Lucas Dawson. The movie's based on English folktales about a strictly religious family that encounters forces of evil in the woods near the place where they live. I personally believe that this film is a total masterpiece in every single aspect. From the great haunting visuals to the genius story told, this film is absolutely incredible. All the actors do a great job, especially Anya Taylor-Joy who is so talented and certainly has a bright future ahead of her. The tone of the film is brilliant and really scary to think about. The family was religious and had 'faith' in God, but what they did not realize is that they did not have faith in one another and so that creates conflict and from conflict comes sin. Something which they are strongly against, and yet it consumes them entirely, sin is there deep down in their hearts and they could never escape it. The Witch is riddled with ideas that make you think and are chilling that will undeniably stick with you for quite a while after. It is such a well made film, from the smart lighting that reflects upon the characters to the suspenseful score composed by Mark Korven. My only issue is that it is a bit slow at times, but once you get into the characters and the story that is being told, it is a thrill ride from then on. The ending is also insane and frankly really scary too. I loved this film and I would recommend any horror and movie fan in general who just wants to see a masterpiece, to watch it now.",10,21,45,14 September 2016
Steve Jobs," Amazing dialogue mixed in with great directing and performances
","Steve Jobs is directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin.It stars Michael Fassbender as Jobs,other supporting cast include Kate Winslet,Seth Rogen,Katherine Waterston,Michael Stuhlbarg and Jeff Daniels The movie explores Steve Jobs and it's divided in three parts on different time periods.Steve Jobs is completely about dialogue,so many people can be bored endlessly if they only want action in movies and excitement but thankfully I am one of those people who appreciate dialogue driven films. It doesn't go through the entire life of Steve Jobs and obviously many important elements were left out on that aspect but it is not what the movie's about at all.We're here to see how he got to be the Steve Jobs that we all know,to see why he is who he is and with the help of the amazing dialogue written by Aaron Sorkin we get it. Michael Fassbender gives one of the best performances of the entire year and so does Kate Winslet.Some of the scenes including the father- daughter story line are very emotional and build on the character and likability of Steve.Also,Fassbender nails every single scene he is in so having him on screen in between these emotional,dialogue scenes just makes everything perfect. I really like the way the entire movie was played out to us,the dialogue is great and so is the acting.The director did a fantastic job here,but he did have one of the best screenwriters working today to help him out,which concluded to an amazingly rich and thrilling movie.",10,0,1,28 February 2016
The Secret Life of Pets," Good fun
","The Secret Life of Pets is an animated adventure comedy movie directed by Chris Renaud and Yarrow Cheney. It stars the voices of Louis C.K., Eric Stonestreet, Kevin Hart, Steve Coogan, Ellie Kemper, Bobby Moynihan, Lake Bell, Dana Carvey, Hannibal Buress, Jenny Slate, and Albert Brooks. The movie follows Max, a dog who lives as a pet with his owner and enjoys everyday with her. That is until the owner brings in another pet named Duke who Max has some problems with. I very much liked this film, it is a fun colorful animated flick with a very talented voice cast and some very good laughs along the way. It is interesting and has a very good concept, despite it being similar to Toy Story. But it totally works in favor of the film as it does hold our interest until the end with likable, yet underdeveloped, characters that any pet owner will fall in love with. It is not perfect however as it has many apparent flaws, as I already mentioned it is very similar to Toy Story and it borrows a lot from it. The side characters are just there really, they don't do much and we get to know very little about them throughout the entirety of the film. But all in all, this is a hit for Illumination who surely know how to make those numbers at the box office huge every single time. Imagine this movie even surpassed Inside Out at the domestic gross and it holds the highest opening record for an original movie ever, again surpassing a much better film - Inside Out, which is insane to think about.",8,2,3,16 September 2016
Parasite," Intricate storytelling
","The manner which the story is being told here, combined with some very intriguing characters, make this one of the best movies of the year. A lot about this film is very well done, from the acting to the shot composition. I also love the social commentary undertones. The ending is a bit unnecessarily violent, but overall this is a very good movie I would say.",8,1,5,30 November 2019
The Big Short," Very well directed
","The Big Short is an amazing and very well done movie directed by Adam McKay.The film also includes many stars such as Christian Bale,Steve Carell,Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt. The movie is based on a book by Michael Lewis and it's the true story of the U.S mortgage housing crisis of 2005.Through their own research,some investors find out that the US mortgage backed securities market was a bubble about to burst.Then they decide to take on the big banks,and rightfully so,but what they didn't know is the impact on the average person that this is going to have. I really enjoyed this movie,it has great acting and the stand out to me is certainly Christian Bale who once again gives a very good performance.Though that's nothing new really,he has been amazing since he started in this business.Steve Carell is also brilliant here,and maybe just as good as he was in Foxcatcher. The director does a very good job at portraying these events on the big screen and most importantly making them simple enough for the average person to understand,since there are a lot of numbers.The editing by Hank Corwin is amazing too and so is the score.I guess the only issues that I had are the way that some elements were explained (by cameos),and that fourth-wall breaking thing got boring and weird at some point. Overall,this is a very well made and interesting movie that's amazingly directed and edited.The acting is top notch by pretty much everyone,and despite a few flaws I totally enjoyed this movie",9,0,1,24 February 2016
Mother!," What an experience
",Mother! is an absolutely mesmerising film with an incredible story mysteriously told. The acting is great and the themes and ideas that this movie presents are just amazing and shocking that a movie of this magnitude would even bother with that. Of course mainstream audiences did not exactly enjoy this movie but that was to be expected. Going into this film without knowing much about it is the best way to experience it.,9,0,4,8 February 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice Ultimate Edition Review
","Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is a superhero film directed by Zack Snyder and written by Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer. It is a follow-up to Man of Steel and the second movie in the DC Extended Universe. The main cast includes the names of Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Jesse Eisenberg, Diane Lane, Laurence Fishburne, Jeremy Irons, Holly Hunter and Gal Gadot. The general public is concerned over having Superman on their planet and letting the 'Dark Knight' - Batman - pursue the streets of Gotham. While this is happening, a power-phobic Batman tries to attack Superman.,Meanwhile Superman tries to settle on a decision, and Lex Luthor, the criminal mastermind and millionaire, tries to use his own advantages to fight the 'Man of Steel'. I personally really liked Man of Steel and I. generally speaking, am a fan of Zack Snyder so going in to this movie I had really high expectations especially considering that I'm a huge fan of both Batman and Superman also. I only watched the Ultimate Edition though, so that's what I'm going to be reviewing. Though quite long at 3 hours and 2 minutes, this is one great movie with amazing sequences and extremely great looking visuals. I personally loved Batman v Superman, Ben Affleck is perfect as Batman and Bruce Wayne. Though everyone was criticizing the choice at first, now that is by far the most praised part of the movie. I believe he is the best on screen Batman/Bruce Wayne we've ever had. Henry Cavill impressed me on Man of Steel and he is just as good here. I liked the whole controversy involving Superman, some of the things that included him and his choices affecting him and his moral values. Gal Gadot was amazing as Wonder Woman. I simply adored her portrayal of the iconic character and her motives genuinely make sense. Jesse Eisenberg did not really bother me as Lex Luthor, I know mostly everybody found his performance flawed and he was probably the most criticized of the cast, but he works on the movie as a villain as he gets the story going. The end fight between Batman and Superman is amazingly well shot and done. The visuals just felt so real and grim, I personally love that this movie is dark and the cinematography is just brilliant and fitting, so is the fantastic score. The whole Doomsday fight had, as the entirety of the movie, great visuals and even though the story line takes a back seat still it is a superhero movie first and foremost, so that'd great if everybody remembered. Nothing beats seeing the trinity on screen for the first time ever. The little cameos from the Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman are brilliantly well though out, and just overall awesome. I have heard a lot of negative reviews for the original theatrical cut, so I hope more people see this version of the movie and appreciate it more.",10,2,9,1 July 2016
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," What a movie !
",This movie just couldn't be any better ladies and gentleman's what a movie.It ends the series in the best possible way and definitely this is one of the best series ever and in my opinion the best one out there.It's dark it's thrilling so many people die I don't wanna spoil to much for you but I am sure that most of you have already seen it cause who would want to miss the most epic movie of all time. 8.1 rating here is so little for this masterpiece.This movie is one of the best and the best in series with The Prisoner of Azkaban. I rate it as high as possible cause this movie is awesome.,10,0,3,19 July 2014
Deadpool," As good as a Deadpool movie was ever going to be.
","Deadpool is a superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. It is on the same universe as the X-Men films and it is directed by Tim Miller. It stars Ryan Reynolds, Morena Baccarin, Ed Skrein, T. J. Miller, Gina Carano, Leslie Uggams and Brianna Hildebrand. In Deadpool, Wade Wilson hunts the man who gave him an accelerated healing factor but also a scarred physical appearance. I liked this movie a lot, it's probably up there on my X-Men movie ranking. Though my favorites are still First Class and Days of Future Past. Ryan Reynolds is P E R F E C T on the role of Deadpool. He has comedic talent and is very good at acting. The jokes he makes on the movie are straight up hilarious, and the puns are just as clever. This is definitely as good as a Deadpool movie was ever going to be. Though it was clear they had a small budget, they still made the most of it and nothing looks fake at all. The action is amazingly shot and superbly done. There's no shaky cam or whatever that thing is that other cheap action movies do, here is just great stunt work mixed in with great visuals and hilarious one liners all around. The fourth wall breaks are genius and well though out. They had great timing and were actually funny. While the overall story might be a bit formulaic, still all the other amazing things just surpass that and make us forget the abomination that was X-Men Origins.",6,5,13,11 June 2016
Annihilation," Ambitious and intriguing
","Annihilation is the type of film that makes you think after watching it. Of course people expecting a typical alien invasion movie with action sequences every minute are going to be disappointed, and while I am not discrediting those who understood the film and did not like it anyways, I think the fact that it even invokes thinking is a huge win.",7,2,6,19 March 2018
Spectre," Amazing!!
","Spectre is the twenty-fourth James Bond film in the famous franchise and it is directed by Sam Mendes.It stars James Bond returning for a fourth time as the titular character,also other stars are Christoph Waltz,Lea Seydoux,Naomie Harris,Ben Whishaw and Dave Bautista. This movie is about James Bond following an cryptic message from the past which leads him to Mexico City and Rome.He secretly infiltrates a meeting and then discovers the existence of an secret organization SPECTRE.And as Bond gets closer to this organization he then learns about the connection with him and the Spectre leader (Christoph Waltz). In my opinion this is an amazing movie and a very well shot one with mesmerizing action sequences that are as much interesting as they are memorable.I truly enjoyed this movie and I can't see where all the hate is going at because there's nothing terrible about this. Daniel Craig nails the role again,this guy simply can do no wrong.It's like he was born to play this character and it fits him perfectly.He is gentle,funny well talking and interesting to watch when he is throwing down.Lea Seydoux is also very good on the role.She shows emotion when needed to,her story line is interesting,she's very hot and most importantly I really bought her relationship with James Bond. Christoph Waltz is the main complain that I have heard about this movie,and first of all,he is very good on the role as he always is.His character on the other hand while interesting,simply does not do much and I can see where all the complains about his character go.But he isn't a completely terrible villain.it's just that he doesn't get much screen time.that's all.Maybe it is also because Silva was such an memorable and great villain on Skyfall and well,comparing Franz to him is just not possible because Silva is definitely one of the best villains of all time,not only on the Bond franchise. The score on this movie is also phenomenal simply very very good.I really like Sam Smith's song,Writings on the Wall,but also Thomas Newman did an incredible job here capturing the emotion and the feels of this movie.It gives more depth to the characters and makes some of the scenes even more intense then they already are. Even the dialogue was terrific and the cinematography is great,so are the visuals.I also have to mention the sound effects which were very good.Some of the best sound effects every put in cinema.When they were shooting and hitting people it felt so real and like you are actually there with them.When explosions happened it felt as if they were happening close by.Simply perfect and I truly hope that gets an Oscar nom because it truly deserves it. I really like the direction this movie went and Sam Mendes has done a wonderful job here just as he has done in Skyfall.I really like this director and pretty much all the actors here do a very good job,even Dave Bautista is good as an hit-man chasing Bond.He is big,scary and strong,he puts up a fight and it truly is a challenge to our hero. Though the running time might be a slight bit too long and the villain is underused (especially considering that it is Christoph Waltz),still this is a very well made and edited movie with a lot of intense and well directed sequences,amazing acting,depth to the characters,great score,good visuals/sound effects and I had a lot of fun with it.",9,0,5,27 November 2015
Her," Weird but Good at the same time !
",This movie is truly a good movie even though it seems weird and there are still parts that I didn't understand very well still this movie puts you in a different world I'm pretty sure we all would wanna have an OS like that especially with Scarlet Johansson's voice in it.I love Her I love the back up story I thought that Joaquin Phoenix was awesome and played his role very well actually I think that this guy plays every role well he is just so good.I loved Amy Adams she was just perfect even though there were scenes that were not that good to be watched with the family still is so good that just can't destroy this awesome movie definitely in my TOP 5 of 2013 !,10,0,2,18 July 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," Action done masterfully.
","Mad Max Fury Road is by far the best movie of the year and one of the best movies in history of cinema.An insane movie filled with amazing looking action,great acting and overall very intense.This movie has it all. Everything about the way that the action is directed is perfect,all the time the main character is in danger and you never know how it will end.There's a guy playing the guitar during all the action,that's just freaking insane. Tom Hardy does such an amazing job here,he fits on the movie perfectly and Charlize Theron is also very very good on the role.Also there's a certain amount of heart to the characters that makes you love them even more.It's not just brainless action,it makes sense and it's done beautifully. George Miller is back to show us how to do action in the best way possible.He built this movie in practical effects and I appreciate that even more.Cars flipping and real explosion over the top makes the movie even more insane. I really can't think of a negative about this movie so I'm definitely going to give it a perfect 10/10 rating and deservedly so. Go see this movie if you still haven't,I personally can't wait to re- watch it and experience this amazing craziness all over again.",10,2,8,30 December 2015
Warcraft," Simply amazing.
","Warcraft is a fantasy film directed by Duncan Jones and stars Travis Fimmel, Paula Patton, Ben Foster, Dominic Cooper, Toby Kebbell, Ben Schnetzer, Robert Kazinsky and Daniel Wu. The film is based on the Warcraft video game series and portrays the encounters between humans and orcs taking place in different locations that have been set by the video game series before. I personally absolutely loved Warcraft from beginning to end, the incredible visuals that are perfectly mixed in with the amazing written story make up for one of the best summer blockbusters in a long while. All the actors do a fantastic job here, with Travis Fimmel as the leading character on the human side, who is really good on the role. I personally bought Dominic Cooper as the king and Ben Foster as the guardian who gave a very intimidating performance. On the orcs side the motion capture performances were absolute perfection, with the amazing Toby Kebbell on the lead as Durotan. Without spoiling anything I was really caught off by surprise by the amount of deaths of the main characters on this film. I have never played any of the video games and I had no idea what I was walking in to but that really raised the stakes up for the finale against the ever so brilliant villain of the film Gul'dan portrayed by Daniel Wu. The soundtrack composed by Ramin Djawadi is also beautiful and epic at times. It fit in with the battles perfectly all throughout. Overall I truly enjoyed this film and my only issues with it is that the beginning is kind of slow but everything else was amazing and just breathtaking to look at. I am a big fan of the film and I hope there will be a sequel in the near future to arrive.",7,3,5,29 August 2016
Me Before You," Romance well done
","Me Before You is a romantic drama film directed by Thea Sharrock based on the novel by Jojo Moyes with the same name. The film stars Emilia Clarke, Sam Claflin, Jenna Coleman, Charles Dance, Matthew Lewis, Ben Lloyd-Hughes and Janet McTeer. The movie is about a girl named Lou Clark who is desperate for a job and so the goes on to take care of a recently paralyzed man from a rich family, who she slowly creates a bond with. This is a well made movie with amazing performances all around, especially by the amazing Emilia Clarke who gives a wonderful performance on the leading role. By her side is Sam Claflin who plays Will Traynor, and he does a very good job too. It is a movie filled with heart breaking emotional scenes, very good cinematography and a brilliant score by Craig Armstrong that makes Me Before You as a whole one of the best romances there are. Sure it has some problems, and the ending will leave some people confused and angry but overall this movie works on so many levels that those flaws are hardly even noticeable as the good outweighs the bad by a lot.",9,9,14,11 September 2016
13 Hours," Michael Bay at his best.
","13 hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is a biographical war film directed by Michael Bay and written by Chuck Hogan. It stars James Badge Dale, John Krasinski, Max Martini, Pablo Schreiber, and Toby Stephens on the main roles. Based on a true story, the film follows six members of a security team who fight to defend the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya after waves of terrorist attacks on September 11, 2012. The directing in this movie is really good, and for that I have to credit Michael Bay, because even though he has made some not-so-good movies in the recent years, I knew he had talent and he certainly shows it in this one. The cinematography is also great by Dion Beebe, but what stands out to me the most is the score composed by Lorne Balfe. It brought up the emotions when needed to and it made us feel for these people a lot throughout. The acting is superb all around, but the two shinning stars are James Badge Dale and especially John Krasinski, who had to play out most of the emotional scenes and he pulled out like a pro. The movie has caused some controversy since it is based on a true story that happened back in 2012, but the politic elements are smartly not touched upon on this movie as we are really just seeing the movie from these six guy's eyes. They do not know what is happening yet they have the courage to take some action and actually save lives. It did start to feel like it is a bit too long by the end, and it does have some shaky cam here and there, but really those are the only negatives that I found. In my opinion this is a very well made movie, and definitely one of, if not the, best Bay film ever .",7,0,4,20 July 2016

I seriously loved this movie,the performances are all very great,especially Matt Damon who gives the performance of a lifetime.He seems very much committed to the role and he is full of emotion that equals to a great and Oscar-worthy performance. Ridley Scott does an incredible job here with the way that he decides to take on the story and also the ending is just brilliant and very well directed. The score by Harry Gregson-Williams is also very haunting and memorable but what stands out the most here is the incredibly amazing cinematography by Dariusz Wolski. The Mars scenes look great and they just feel real,them mixed with the very good visual effects just make for the perfect once in a lifetime experience. I really enjoyed The Martian and it's certainly one of the best movies of 2015.Ridley Scott is back with a bang.",10,1,4,22 February 2016
