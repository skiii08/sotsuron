Ford v Ferrari," Not bad but something is missing.
","Decent movie. But i don't understand what's missing. May be the casting. In this movie, I just watched Christian Bale and Matt Damon. Not the actual characters. Cinematography not so powerful. Sound editing really well -At the end you are watching a race car based movie. Sound must be well- I cannot praise character build up as well. Some of them are just there like John Bernthal. Anyway, it's a nice movie to spend couple of hours for fun. If you have a nice sound system just wait for BR.",7,3,7,8 December 2019
