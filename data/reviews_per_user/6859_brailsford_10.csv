The Incredible Hulk," Feels like a spiritual sequel, not the best in the series, but definitely not the worst either.
","This movie was intended to be a reboot, but it comes across feeling like a direct to video sequel in terms of the story. The action luckily was a bit better. The story begins with Hulk where he ended up at the end of Hulk even though this is supposed to be a new story and a different hulk. This time around though the story is lighter but still not as light heart-ed as it could be. The story follows Bruce looking for a cure to his anger management with the help of a scientist he met online while his old enemy General Thadeus Ross continues his efforts to get him by recruiting a new soldier who he has enhanced to make him better equipped to take down the hulk. The movie covers what happens if the hulk were to temporarily lose his powers and if an enemy were introduced who could match hulk (Abomination). The story was watchable without getting too weird making it easier to watch then the other Hulk movie but it still wasn't as much fun as Iron Man. That said it was watchable even if not as memorable as Iron Man. It works as its own movie but it's really more a background noise or popcorn flick. I wouldn't say it was an improvement over Hulk.. just a different kind of movie.",6,0,1,11 November 2016
Spider-Man: Homecoming," I liked everything about this movie... except spiderman.
","This movie had a good story, good characters, heck Iron Man was even likable in his cameo, the movie had a good version of the classic villain The Vulture. That said, spiderman was as annoying as he was in civil war (maybe even more so) the idea of spiderman being a kid about the age of the Runaways just isn't improving the character for me, also this entire reboot glossed over spiderman's origins even more then Batman's origins were in the Batman v. Superman (there wasn't even an Uncle Ben referenced). The nerdy buddy who knows his identity didn't really help the movie either. I just don't think Tom Holland's a good spiderman... but theres still a chance he might grow into the character.",6,1,5,2 March 2018
Captain America: The First Avenger," Finally a Captain America Movie... that doesn't suck
","Looking back at the Captain America franchise over the years going all the way back to the characters creation a series of movie serial started a tradition of a more 40s type of hero, something that had a very hard time getting separated from the character. In the later comics the cap was preserved to be around in the future via getting frozen in ice. Travel forward to the 70s we have a 2 TV Movie that tries follow on the success of other live action TV Superhero shows like The Incredible Hulk and Spider-Man by making a sort of TV pilot for a modern day version of the character at that time. We wouldn't see another adaption til the 90s where we got another movie, that to be frank just wasn't very good.I went in kind of skeptical that the character would get another one of these portrayals going with a friend after we actually rewatched those other series to see what it was getting compared to.We left the theater pleasantly surprised The origin wasn't rushed but also didn't make it boring. It gave a backstory for the characters and in the end resulted in popularizing the Character of Samantha Carter enough to get her own TV Series later on in the franchise.My biggest gripe was it kind of took Red Skull out of the series. I believe Hugo Weaving said he didn't want to do the character again... but given the comic story of him, it doesn't even need to be him, heck at some times he actually uses Steve Roger's body so perhaps they might consider again at some point in infinity wars... but for now we'll have to wait.",8,1,2,29 November 2017
Justice League," This movie reeks of desperation to compete with Marvel
","DC had a chance to be successful, not based on competing with the MCU, but by trying to make good stories for there characters, taking the time to build a universe that fans would want more of. Instead they run head long in after one good movie, try to directly compete with another franchises latest movie creating a crumby product. It's hard to believe the company that gave us the DC animated universe couldn't learn a lesson from it and realize how stupid it was to go head to head with Marvel. That is why we got garbage with Batman v. Superman, and that is why this one is as bad, maybe worse.Humor is inserted this time, that feels forced, incredibly, unsubtly forced. It hasn't always been perfect in marvel, but overall it hasn't felt like ringing the last drop of water out of a dish rag. Drawing faces on people. Taking a serious scene and following a line like 'Do you bleed?' with 'Definitely feel something bleeding' 5 seconds later. It's like they couldn't even figure out when to be funny, when to be serious in a single scene.This movie felt like it was checking off items on a list of things they thought they needed to make the movie as successful as Avengers.That said it gets an extra star for being so bad... it's practically an mst3kable film with plenty of things to crack jokes about.Some of you are not going to agree with this review, but there are also some out there so fanatically dedicated to this universe they can't criticize it when it drops the football like it has.If you are willing to go in fairly watching this movie it has some cool special effects, a horrible script but on the plus side, it's significantly more coherent then B. V. S. Also more Alfred, Alfred is probably the best part of the movie.I don't recommend this movie as a good superhero movie but rather as an experience... to see just how bad franchise can get in 5 movies.",2,7,15,24 November 2017
Man of Steel," Strong Beginning.. wish I didn't know what I knew now
","I'm not going to lie... I went in expecting to hate this movie thinking it was just another emo super hero movie that wasn't going to deliver. I saw it and overall I thought it was an enjoyable movie... I actually liked Jar El in a movie for a change. Was it overly dark, maybe a bit, but it was an enjoyable story where superman had a worthy adversary.... the plot didn't need kryptonite or make it feel like superman was holding back too much... The biggest issue I had was Jonathan Kent... he felt like the anti uncle Ben... he was there to be a downer to Clark up until a tornado took him away to that Oz beyond the stars. But as far as the villains go, I'd say I'm a big fan of Terrance Stamp particularly in the Zod role... but this Zod was enjoyable. Did it feel like it was trying to add preachier and deeper stuff not needed in a superman movie? maybe... but it was still a move you could eat popcorn while watching and not leave thinking... 'this was stupid' granted I know quite a few out there did.",8,4,6,9 August 2016
Thor," I didn't really know what to think going in, it was a good surprise
","I watched the first two movies in the MCU so I wanted to be ready by watching this one as well. I wasn't as aware of the character as I was of hulk (wasn't exactly knowledgeable about Iron Man either before that movie but I knew enough about him, Thor I knew he was based on a Norse god, that was about it). After finally seeing I have to say this was a good movie. It spent more time developing the villain then the previous 2 movies (which was important given the significance of the character in coming films). The actors were all at their best (everyone had a likable personality good guy or bad guy) The movie featured good fights... some awesome visual, like- able characters and a good set up for the Avengers movies (Iron Man was OK, The Incredible Hulk... Meh...). That said it stands on it's own as a good watch and essential to watch if you're serious about watching all the MCU films.",8,1,2,11 November 2016
Wonder Woman," It had some fun moments and was a good watch, too long though
","This movie with the exception of Man of Steel is the best thing to come out of DC connected movie franchise so far. It has an interesting prequel to her appearance in Batman V. Superman where you get to see her history coming into being and what lead up to her becoming the super hero she is today.It takes place back in WWII which makes some ways makes one think at times about Captain America: The First Avenger, although the problem here is the non action elements in some cases draw on too long and aren't entirely interesting or even all that relevant in the end.The fights and the villain are entertaining though and it results in a satisfying ending in the end. If you can forgive it for dragging in places, you probably will like it overall.",7,1,3,29 November 2017
Black Panther," An acceptable movie, but not deserving the Praise it gets.
","It's understandable given the month it came out that it would get a little bit of an 'inflated score' but 'Best Comic book movie ever' is just being silly. This movie has things for the comic book fan and delivers action, the problem is though, it's just ok, doesn't make the character any more interesting then he ever was. Ant Man made a character who is historically not likeable into an interesting character. Black Panther remains an 'out of touch' with real people superhero. Yeah there are others like that, but how many super heros are also rulers of a secret super advance nation. Iron had issues with his drinking, relationship problems, issues with his dad. Hulk had anger issues, fear of abandonment. Heck even thor had a heck of a lot of relatable family problems. This hero is a natural warrior destined to be king, his dad was already taken out in civil war so it begins with him taking over as king, he is bestowed super human strength and reflex and has a super advanced costume. Heck even Spider-Man homecoming Peter had relatable problems so its not about starting wearing the mantle. The plot being cookie cutter didn't help either, the villain being obvious villain up til the reveal of the less obvious main villain being still pretty obvious. In the end this movie doesn't really add anything necessary for the series or even interesting to the mcu. That said movie wasn't really awful... it just didn't deliver all the hype promised. If you must watch everything MCU, it's not going to be terrible, it won't likely be your favorite film though,",6,4,8,26 February 2018
Iron Man," Beginning of the Marvel Cinematic Universe
","Iron Man was a pretty heavily hyped movie when it came out. It came at a time when Marvel was re-envisioning their series, and Ultimately creating a new universe in films (and later on TV and movie channels). Some efforts in the past have fallen flat.... Luckily Iron Man wasn't such a move. We get to see the story of how the iconic character goes from being a genius billionaire to a mobile suit wearing super hero. Robert Downey Jr nails the character, it's actually very hard to picture anyone else in the role. As it's an origin story it might not have the most interesting villain for the movie, but it still is someone interesting enough to offer a good story. Basically this movie is what one looks for in a good firsts movie in a major film series. It introduces other Major Characters in the series such as Phil Coulson, Nick Fury. A good movie to start a universe and a good movie all around.",9,0,2,31 October 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Tries to do everything and fails miserably because of it.
","First off I loved Man of Steel, I thought it was a new adaption of the character and had no major issues with that film's portrayal of him. This is the first in the series the Just Us (because Batman and Superman are all that mater according to this movies script) leagueNow on that note lets get to this movie, which recaps Batman's entire career at this point to the opening segment of the movie. We then see Bruce try to save some guy who ultimately becomes paralyzed and blames superman for it... Bruce in turn also blames him. We see super man beat up some terrorist to save Lois (lane has been omitted from her name in the credits so I will too), after this a whole bunch of discussion about superman needing to be kept in check. Lois remind him the world might not trust him and he responds with sex....Eventually we meet who who turns out to be Luthor the film, who played the role like he was confused with whether he was Lex Luthor or a precursor character to the Joker. His biggest issues include he isn't suave, he has no legitimate reason to have issues with superman (superman actually helped his business so yeah he should actually love him). He eventually introduces Bruce and Clark who make little comments about each other's alter egos.Lex sets up a trap to get Superman blamed for blowing up a meeting of world powers, by convincing Senator Finch who he is inexplicably on friendly terms with for some reason. While no one believes Superman blew up the building, he still is blamed for not stopping it.Lex seduces the military to let him see the Zod ship by using the most awkward product placement for Jolly Ranchers in history to convince him to let him see the ship. He convinces the ship he is the last living kryptonian and then proceeds to meddle with the cloning capabilities (The ship initially refuses as it goes against krytonian law, but agrees after he claims he is the last living kryptonian despite using his own dna with the ship, would have thought a civilization this advance could make a better security protocol for preventing this from happening) of the ship to mix his DNA with Zod.... which if we learned anything from superman 4 mixing Lex's code with kryptonian dna results in bad things that will hurt people.Batman and Superman meet and Superman tell him to retire and Batman asks if he bleeds. Bat Superman goes off to seek advice of Johnathan Kent, who is an illusion? a hologram from the fortress of solitude? I don't know.Superman is then lured into a trap when Lois being useful by being kidnapped by Lex, he in the ultimate cliché pushes her off the building and superman catches her. He then give superman an ultimatum, kill batman or he'll have his mother killed (cause superman can't possibly with his vast array of powers come up with a way to find his mother before Luthor reacts... when Batman can) They have a titanic fight where Batman holds the upper hand much of the fight thanks to his Hulkbuster-clone and kryptonite gas (am I crazy or this seem like some type of gimmick Ceaser Romano Joker would have used if superman came after him?) Ultimately Superman tries to reason with this batman to no avail until he cries out Martha... and the fight literally ends because Batman realizes they both had mothers with the same name (This plot point literally is cringeworthy, dumbest reason for a pointless fight to end). Superman and Batman make peace and realize something else is coming that is vulnerable to kryptonite, right after Lois tosses the kryptonite spear batman had to finish off Supes (because this batman is cool with killing which is another problem I have with this movie) Batman goes off and rescues Martha, after shooting a bunch of people (because in the comics he never had any issues with guns or murder or anything) Finally Lois retrieve the staff get it to Superman, Wonderwoman inexplicably is there for the final battle with Doomsday.... Superman and Doomsday fight and he gets killed while killing doomsday. Lex goes to prison, his head is shaved, batman sneaks in to mess with his head... he starts cackling (seriously he knew he was playing Lex Luthor right? ) As the films ending we get a hint Superman isn't dead.In looking back.... this movies biggest problem is it tries too hard to tackle and stitch together stories that just don't connect... It doesn't spend any real time needed to tell any of its stories properly. It sticks in other members of the justice league as easter eggs. This fight between Superman and Batman was better portrayed in the direct to video movie The Dark Knight Returns part II (It made more sense and it had a reasonable reason for them to fight). Superman Doomsday better shows the fight between Superman and Doomsday. Justice League War did a much better job as the introduction of the justice league... something based on this would have been a much better storyline to follow then trying to force a fight between Superman and Batman at this point (it really feels this film was trying to get the drop on Civil War). The only really likable things in the movie were Alfred Pennyworth and Diane Prince/WonderWoman and they had about 12 minutes of time if you combine their appearances. The movie drags on for 2 hours (it seriously feels like 3) I can't recommend this movie. i'd have to rank this movie as in comic book movie disappointment between XMen Origins: Wolverine and XMen-First Class in terms of failing to be watchable.",1,2,10,14 July 2016
