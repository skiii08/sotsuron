Kill Bill: Vol. 2," dull
","Just saw this movie, and it was pretty slowwww. I mean there were five or six scenes in it that were very good(pad mai training, the burial, etc). What killed it for me was that it seemed that everyone was the typical villain and it was way to drawn out. Like David caradine always explaining his motive, or the long shots of just movement of the characters. Some times the acting even seems a little campy and I am not talking about the kung fu master. Like the part where shes driving in black n white and talking to the camera, or the guy getting chewed out by his strip club boss.all in all I should have waited and rented this movie.",1,5,10,16 May 2004
50 First Dates," Not what I expected
","This movie took me off guard, why? Because I had seen the previews and never really knew to much about it. I thought it would be funny because of Sandler and Schinder, but I was wrong, or right. See thats the problem this movie was on one hand funny and touching that someone could love someone that much, but on the other sad and weird (kidnap victim, family not trying to help her, cus it was only a year ago). Dunno I was left speechless after seeing this movie. I have had a day to reflect, yet still I am like errr. So either way I am neither happy nor unhappy about seeing this, yet I will file this movie as one of those that I have seen but do not wish to intentionally rent again. I gave it a 6 because I think thats what it deserved, it was funny, yet sad, yet odd. Though I did find Sandlers helper at the aquarium funny.",6,0,0,26 June 2004
