Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," A fun, exciting movie, worth watching!
","the fourth of the 'Caribbean' films is as exciting and hilarious as were the previous three: Jack Sparrow is as charming and funny as always - Johnny Depp was truly made for this role!, the chasing, escaping and battle scenes in the weirdest places possible are as entertaining as in the previous films, the plot is exciting and the scenery is breathtaking.The cast was changed right in time before the old heroes became boring, and Penelope Cruz does her part extremely well - she fits in perfectly! Balckbeard is wonderful for a new 'bad guy' - a funny but scary character.I usually don't like the 3D, but it was made well this time - almost the whole movie is 3D, unlike Tron, for example. It really adds to the atmosphere.",10,1,2,4 June 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," the Best Harry Potter movie so far
","the film is loyal to the book without being boring. It has the right atmosphere - very dark, much tension, but there are enough funny moments to change the mood in the right time. Visual effects are stunning as they should be, wouldn't expect anything less than that. as a huge H.P fan, I'd say the film is highly recommendable.the decision to cut the film to two was smart, since the length of the book makes it impossible to make a movie that will be both loyal to the text and won't last a day or cut out important moments like in the fourth part (Goblet of Fire), which was truly a shame, as it's the most spectacular book of them all. The film ended just in the right moment to leave me with a taste for more!",9,0,3,12 April 2011
