Catch Me If You Can," I mean it is good but
","Mostly just reminded me of better movies , they just what I kept thinking about every few scenes (this 'review' just exists for my own first impression to revisit later)",6,0,1,29 February 2020
Memento," Opinion will almost definitely change on rewatch , characters and presentation is more important than the act
","Maybe it'll go down or up now that I know it's going where it going I can just judge the presentation, which I found to be a bit too much on the repetitive side , really wanted to like this ; loved basically every no superhero thing nolan has worked on just don't like how pointless the story was in some ways .I'll try to be focused on characters next it's just stupid to me that he was fooling his own self why not just skip like ten steps maybe don't right teddy is the one directly since he won't be convinced by that possibily , I must be missing the point in some way",5,0,3,27 December 2019
Avengers: Endgame," It exists
","I have been watching most marvel movies since when iron man 2 came out , seen em all except hulk , but after watching this I finally had a horrible realisation : I have never felt anything while watching them , other than a few cheap laughs and some impressive action they really don't have much to offer .Why did watch them , this one didn't feel like a waste of time but it didn't feel I a use of my time either *sigh* why , what have i been doing",5,4,5,28 December 2019
Pulp Fiction," It pretty well made and all , went into to it blind don't get why it's so beloved
","The only people that seem to have a problem with movie that I am find seem to be about the violence , gore , swearing I really don't care about those things, it was pretty well made and written movie that I felt basically nothing watching , I will definitely watch it again because I really don't get all the praise this movie gets there really was anything to of the ordinary other than Tarantino's dialogue, I hope I like or at least understand it more when I am older and rewatch it",6,0,4,27 December 2019
