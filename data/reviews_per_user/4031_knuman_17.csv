Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Mmmmm......not bad, considering I haven't really seen any other films in the trilogy
","I had been drawn in by the hype surrounding this movie despite the fact that I can't remember any of the other Star Wars movies and I had no idea what the story was on about. So basically, I judged this movie by itself, not comparing it with the others in the trilogy or other films. However, I must say, considering how crazy everyone was about this movie, I can imagine how many would be disappointed. I thought it was an above average sci-fi flick, but nothing I would be rushing to see again. I didn't think the plot was explained very clearly, and the dialogue was pretty lame....these days special effects alone cannot be the backbone of the movie. The humour was pretty childish as well, I think aimed more at a younger audience (but at least some mature jokes could be put in). I found Jar Jar Binks annoying and not at all funny, and Darth Maul was a joke....all that hype about the double-ended lightsabre, but apart from that, the character was pretty useless (I don't even think he spoke...)..and the fight scenes felt more like dance sequences....too slow and way too choreographed..so obviously there's plenty of room for improvements in the next two films. But on the positive side, it was quite exciting. Some people I talked to found it confusing and rather boring, but I felt that despite the length of the movie, my interest was kept throughout. And even when the film had finished, I felt like I wanted to see more...which I guess is good, but bad because it'll be a few years before I actually do. So overall, I thought it was worth the money, and it certainly did kill the curiosity I had towards all the hype. It's definitely worth watching, even if it is only for the sake of seeing it.",Null,0,0,5 July 1999
Unbreakable," I can't believe so many people disliked it!!
","This movie is cool. I thought after the Sixth Sense, M Night was going to have a tough time coming up with a follow up movie. It's unfair to compare the two movies so closely, considering they aren't really alike, but I think this has to be one of the most original ideas for a movie I've ever seen. It certainly is a brave one. That's why I find it hard to believe that so many people are trashing it.This movie is probably a little slow compared to most Hollywood movies nowadays, but it is NOT a slow movie! Anyone who has seen any independent or foreign films might find it fast-paced! It carries pretty much the same pace as the Sixth Sense, except without the occasional scares.And the plot is not hard to follow or far-fetched at all. How basic must it be for people to understand it? It's a pretty basic concept, but I must admit that people who have read a comic or two in their lives would probably appreciate it more. Still, I thought this was a great movie with an intelligent premise. Shyamalan is a genius for coming up with such great ideas. I can't wait to see what he has in store next.",Null,1,1,12 December 2000
The Beach," I thought it was quite good, actually....
","I saw this movie just before it went out of the cinemas, and I had heard from people that it was good, and read in articles that it was bad. When I finally got around to seeing it, I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Sure enough, it was flawed, but the scenery was breathtaking, and the action was exciting. I never liked Leo, but I thought he was great in the role, and the same can be said for his French companions and most of the cast. I found the story particularly intriguing, and it was excellent most of the way. Towards the end it kind of derailed a little. I questioned the relevance of the entire part when Richard was isolated, because it wasn't done with enough subtlety and depth. Luckily the movie got back on track in time for the finale. But the strange transitions of the central character in between should have been done better. Overall, I thought it was worthwhile, enough for 4 out of 5.",Null,0,0,26 April 2000
Fargo," A most outstanding movie
","Undoubtedly, I think Fargo deserves a lot more praise than it has been given, and should have easily taken out the Best Picture at the Oscars given the competition. This is by far the best film made by the Coen brothers, and is visually very pleasant to watch, with the sharpest, funniest dialogue ever. This is the type of movie that gets better every time you watch, and the people who dislike it simply aren't witty enough to understand the deadpan humour. The length is perfect, and the cast is flawless. Buscemi and Stormare are the best on-screen duo I can recall, and if you think about it, the stupidity of many of the characters simply add to the realism. This is one of my favourite movies, and because it is so off-beat and original, it certainly deserves to be one of the top 100 movies of all time.",Null,0,0,5 October 1998
American Beauty," Nothing much to say except- Great Movie!
","It's rare that a simple drama/comedy could be so memorable, but American Beauty seems to have that ability. I'm not sure exactly what it is- maybe it's the wonderful script, the witty dialogue, the deadpan humour, or the flawless cast and direction- maybe it's a mixture of all these elements. I can't remember a more satisfying film in recent years. Everything about this movie oozes class. I saw all the Best Picture Oscar nominees this year, and I don't think anyone can legitimately argue that it has not been worthy of at least some of the praise and awards it has received. Everyone keeps talking about how wonderful Kevin and Annette were (rightfully so), but I think the Academy should have recognised Wes Bentley's performance. He was a real scene stealer and the movie wouldn't have been the same without him. Undoubtedly a 5 star movie.",Null,0,0,26 April 2000
Saving Private Ryan," SAVING RYAN'S PRIVATES....now THAT would have been a good movie!!
","I think this movie is a good first step towards making more realistic war movies, but it hasn't quite reached there yet. I felt that wimpy translator guy would have been a better old man than Ryan at the end. Besides, he was there for more than 1/3 of the time, unlike Ryan. There are a few areas of improvement. Firstly, they need to cut out all that sentimental and bonding crap, and find other ways of developing characters rather than just a few silly laughs while retelling old times... Secondly, acknowledge that the enemy (in this case, the Germans), were at least partially human, and experienced some of the same emotions those heroic Americans experienced. (F*** Hitler? Man, I would like to hear some of the Americans say that about their leaders). Thirdly, link those excellent battle sequences with the plot of the movie. Oh...and most importantly, don't glorify the war by making all the dead characters look like such big heroes. I thought this movie was supposed to be anti-war. And I can't believe how Ryan was so emotional at the end. He had only met Miller and Co. a few hours before the big battle, and he barely knew Miller or what they went through to save him, except that two of their men died (and I believe that people dying was rather common during that time). Oh, but I guess it was still pretty good.",Null,0,0,21 November 1998
Saving Private Ryan," A must-see movie, but....
","Saving Private Ryan is without a doubt a must-see movie because of the message it conveys in the first 30 minutes or so. I found myself curling up in my seat, cringeing, and hoping not to see any more disturbing scenes, while still glad that I was merely watching a movie. That's how mind-blowing it was. But I seriously felt that the rest of the movie wasn't all that great- it was simply an above average war movie, and the remaining 2.5 hours or so was nowhere near comparable to the first half-hour of the film. There was nothing extraordinarily brilliant, with the exception of a few of the final battle scenes. When I watch a movie, for me, the most important thing is enjoyment. And this movie, while being extremely compelling and thought provoking, was hardly enjoyable (anyone who has seen it would know why). Nevertheless, I had absolutely no idea how the war sequences were choreographed to be so realistic. It really makes you feel that you are in the war itself. But towards the end, Spielberg just couldn't resist to put in his trademark sentimentality into the movie. And for me, that kind of ruined it, because it was undoing all the brilliance of the first 30 minutes. Making it so blatantly obvious that he was trying to make it sentimental and dramatically heroic was in fact glorifying the war, which was the exact opposite of what Spielberg was trying to convey throughout the entire movie. And the nonsense of the final scene made me feel like I was watching another movie written by James Cameron. Despite all the criticisms, I still feel this movie is worthy of the recognition it has been getting. Its brilliance is difficult to deny, and personally, I'll give it 4 out of 5.",Null,0,0,21 November 1998
Hero," Very disappointing
","I saw Hero for the sake of it, and it was very disappointing to say the least. I never thought Crouching Tiger was particularly good, but after watching this film, I'm starting to like it a lot more.Hero undoubtedly has a much grander scale, whereas Crouching Tiger told a more personal tale. Unfortunately, director Zhang Yimou, who has made such excellent drama films, failed miserably in this attempt to reach out to the 'global market' the way Crouching Tiger did. The cinematography was good- a lot of the scenery was extremely beautiful, the score was adequate, Chen Daoming was great as the Emperor, and the first fight scene between Jet Li and Donnie Yen (the only two with real martial arts backgrounds) was finely staged- but these were only few positives that I could find with the film.I think the main problem may have been the film's intentions- to steal the things that made Crouching Tiger successful and try to place it on a much wider canvas with lots of special effects. In the end the film was uninspiring- the script was poorly written, with thin characters and some very very bad dialogue; the special effects, while effective in some parts, was largely over the top (especially the scene with the leaves); with the exception of the first, the fight scenes were very standard and not particularly exciting; and the artistic attempts (with all the colours) felt somewhat pretentious.No doubt a lot of people will still like this film, but it certainly didn't move me one bit. 2.5 stars out of 5.",Null,0,0,28 January 2003
Mulholland Drive," Great most of the way, but...
","I enjoyed this movie most of the way. It started off well and the story was very intriguing, with great acting especially from Naomi Watts. The oddball characters were funny and there certainly were some humorous lines and moments. The overall tone and feel of the film was very surreal, almost creepy to an extent, and that must be attributed to David Lynch. But what the heck happened in the last part of the movie? I think people give the movie far too much credit by trying to make sense of it all, because I don't feel there is any sense to be made. When the movie had nowhere else to go, it essentially just tried to confuse everyone and cheat them out of a logical, coherent conclusion. So basically, it was a very stylish film which I would have liked a lot but for the stupid final part of it.",Null,1,1,4 September 2002
From Dusk Till Dawn," Not exactly a good movie, but nevertheless enjoyable
","This is the type of movie that can easily be liked and just as easily disliked. It's obviously not in the same class as most other Tarantino movies, but whether you enjoyed it or not really depends on the mood you're in at the time. When I first saw it, I thought it was hilarious, and the enjoyment was enhanced by the fact that it didn't take itself seriously. Clooney is incredibly witty and charismatic, and Tarantino is at his irritating best as an actor (which isn't much). I'll probably watch this again some other time and think it's a piece of crap, but for now, I'll say it's worth getting out on video if you feel like watching a lot of gore and cool action, horror and comedy.",Null,0,0,5 October 1998
The Hurricane," Inspirational but flawed
","Undoubtedly, this was a great film, and Denzel Washington was phenomenal, but I had some problems with this movie. I know people have been questioning its authenticity, and I think it should be. This story sells on basis that it is a true story, so if the script is in fact somewhat removed from the truth, then this movie is essentially fiction. One of the things I disliked was how clear cut the heroes and villains were portrayed. Surely Dan Hedaya's character could not have been that bad, and those Canadians were just a little too nice- we had no idea what they did or who they were either. And to think that all this started because Rubin was trying to protect his friend from a paedophile seems a little too good to be true. Perhaps it is all true, but it lacks credibility, since it's from the eyes of the Hurricane, and is subject to obvious bias. Nevertheless, not to take too much away from the movie, it still deserves a 3.5/5.",Null,0,2,26 April 2000
Pulp Fiction," Great cinematic experience
","Pulp Fiction deserves much of the praise that it has been getting, and showed that dialogue alone could make a movie incredibly enjoyable. This movie is filled with terrific conversations between the characters that makes it such a delight to listen to. It isn't flawless though- I felt that entire sequence with Bruce Willis, was way too long, and bordering on the line of boring. But the last 30 minutes or so of the movie is perhaps the best 30 minutes of cinema anyone can ever experience. Starting from the scene in the car where Vincent's little 'accident' occurs, all the way to Jimmy's place and the last scene in the diner is absolutely riveting and most enjoyable to watch. The cast is just amazing, and although I thought Samuel L. Jackson was simply the best, I also really liked Quentin Tarantino's little role- he was wonderfully irritating as Jimmy. The people against all the drugs, violence and profanity should just stop whining- I mean, the movie isn't encouraging this type of behaviour, and besides, they are a bunch of gangsters, so what else would you expect?",Null,0,0,5 October 1998
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Have to admit I was a little disappointed
","Saw the film last night. I had a lot of expectations going in, but while I still enjoyed the movie, it didn't nearly live up to my expectations. I didn't have a problem with the length, and even though it closely followed most of the book, the book was able to flow, but the movie felt somewhat disjointed. The Quidditch scenes were easily the highlight of the film, and the general sets and special effects were extremely good too.There were a few pretty big problems with the movie though. Firstly, Radcliffe can't act. Grint and especially Watson easily outshone him. It might be partly the director or screenwriter's fault, because to me it didn't feel like Harry was the main character- he was just one of a few main characters. He simply didn't have the charisma or ability to carry the film. But he's still young and hopefully he'll improve by the next movie. The adult actors were all brilliant, in particular Coltrane and Rickman.Columbus had a tough job with this movie, since he had to cater for not just children but also a lot of adults. He had a good dose of humour in there, but some of the (cornier) lines didn't work on screen, whereas they did in the book. It's really a shame, because the movie could have been so much better. I thought Tim Burton would have been able to capture that gothic feel a lot better. With that being said, I'll still be looking forward to the next one.",Null,0,0,29 November 2001
The Shawshank Redemption," Perhaps the best movie of all time
","It's always difficult to choose a favourite movie out of all the movies I have seen, but I really believe that this is the one. When I first watched it, I had not read the Stephen King novella, and had no idea what was going to happen, which made it much more enjoyable to watch. Of course, like any movie, this was not flawless, but was such a terrific emotional experience for someone who is seldom moved by cinema. This was such a cinematic triumph, and I couldn't believe that it didn't win any of its seven nominations at the Oscars. The performances were wonderful, captivating the mood of the film to sheer perfection. Nothing against Forrest Gump, but it should have been easily outclassed for Best Picture. It was also a good movie, but just nowhere near as memorable as this one.",Null,0,1,5 October 1998
The Sixth Sense," Excellent, but...
","I went into this movie with a lot of expectations, and I came out pretty satisfied. However, one of the problems associated with the movie was that there was too much exposure to it, and especially about the 'ending'. I tried to avoid reviews, previews and talking to people who had seen it, but it was too difficult. That's why by the time I went to see it, I felt like I already knew the plot, and even though I didn't want to, I started guessing the ending, and sure enough, I guessed it. It was a little disappointing, because if I went into it not knowing there was going to be a twist, I would never have guessed it. So please stop giving away the plot! It only takes more pleasure out of it.",Null,0,0,16 October 1999
Final Destination," Original and exciting
","It's nice to see such a fresh idea for a teenage horror movie- well, anything that doesn't involve slashers is pretty original these days. I thought the director did a good job of setting up the beginning scenes. It was eerily frightening to watch, but it didn't forget to have fun. Humour was added sparingly but appropriately, and I think that's where the movie succeeded. The lead and supporting cast both did well- Devon Sawa has been picking some fine roles to play recently. There was a lack of common sense in some areas, and some inconsistencies in others, but the film didn't take itself seriously enough for warrant criticism for it. I'd give it 3.5/5, which is pretty good for films of this genre.",Null,0,0,26 April 2000
The Thin Red Line," One of the best movies of the year, if you don't mind the slow pace...
","I found the Thin Red Line to be a much more satisfying movie than Saving Private Ryan- by a mile. While they are very different movies, I felt the battle scenes in The Thin Red Line matched Private Ryan's to say the least: they were more structured and handled with greater delicacy, whereas in Private Ryan, it was just a lot of blood and guts scattered all over the place. While it provided perhaps a little more horror and realism, it certainly wasn't as well done. I especially enjoyed the contrast between the battle scenes and the peaceful nature scenes, which were superbly done. Unlike Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line was moving, without being sentimental,which is one of the defining characteristics of the two movies. But it is rather slow at a little less than 3 hours long. While I don't personally mind slow movies, I did see a few people walk out of the cinema halfway through because of the pace. Rather than seeing the slower paced scenes as boring, I tried to understand what they were trying to say. I did have a slight problem with those inner monologues though- I didn't understand half of it. And Nick Nolte's mumbling was particularly hard to understand. Overall, the cast and performances were fantastic, even though some of the cameos (such as Travolta and Clooney) did seem out of place for some reason, and I often questioned the purpose and importance of them being there, even though Woody Harrelson was surprisingly good. One of the most annoying things about watching American-dominated war movies is the way Americans are portrayed, and more importantly, how their enemies are portrayed. Unlike Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line handled this particularly well, which is why I think non-Americans would enjoy this movie a little more. I can see why a lot of people disliked this movie, and I guess it is reasonable for people to dislike it. But I think if you don't mind a slow pace, then you'll find this movie an extremely rewarding cinematic experience, more rewarding than Saving Private Ryan ever will be.",Null,1,2,24 February 1999
