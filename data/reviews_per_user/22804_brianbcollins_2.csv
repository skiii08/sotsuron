The Avengers," Random nonsense
","This movie is stupid, it's random cutscenes of action with a stupid story in the background. Everyone likes it because all of the super heroes are together which I guess is alright but it's just too much. All of these comic book movies follow the same Boeing format.",1,1,2,16 November 2019
Friday Night Lights," Handheld random zoom
","The camera work in this movie is terrible. Handheld shots zooming in and out rapidly make the scenes hard to follow. It's a football movie, a team sport, there were barely any shots from above showing a single play being played out with the whole team. I watch football weekly and watching this tight filming style is nothing like the real game and very hard to follow. Random cut in scenes of crowd, plays and other nonsense. Also, Billy Bob is in anything he does, he's not even acting rather just being himself, but as usual delivers a decent performance.",5,0,1,18 January 2020
