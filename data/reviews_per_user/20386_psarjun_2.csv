The Hangover," Very Funny and 100% Comedy
","The Movie is Funny. I had not laughed this much for any movie recently. The Movie is R Rated. Sorry, with very few editing the movie can be viewed by Family together.Plot: Two Days before the Marriage Doug Billings travels with his Friends for a Bachelor Party in Las Vegas. Introduction of Friends: Stu Price is a Dentist, Phil Wenneck is a School Teacher and Daug's Brother in Law Crazy Alan Garner. In one of the Best Hotels in Las Vegas, they celebrate with lot of Drinks at the Roof Top. Next Morning 'Hangover' is the Movie. When Phil, Stu and Alan wake up what they saw is just crazy, A Chicken in the Caesar's Palace (Hotel) Suit, a Tiger in the Bathroom!!!, A BABY in their room, Stu has a Missing Tooth, A Room destroyed as if there was a Cat Fight in the previous night. And! Doug is Missing!!!! Only few hours left for his Marriage. The rest is about how the Trio is finding their Friend.Minuses: Few Sex related Scenes or Pics or Dialoges. Should have reduced for Family Viewing. But not Vulgar as American Pie and this movie cannot be counted along with American Pie or similar movies not can be counted along with Mr. Bean type of Comedy movies. This is a Modern Comedy, a 2009 Comedy. 3G Comedy. Friends, Boys, You will enjoy this. Girls! mm?! OK, yes. if you are alone, you too will enjoy this more than any other movies. And Couples!@ this is entertaining.Movie Name: Saroja Language: Tamil Actors: Shiva, Vaibhav Reddy, SPB Charan, Premji Amaren Release Date: 5th September, 2008Saroja (Plot) - Four Friends - one is Extremely Stupid.

They are movie to Hyderabad from Chennai for watching a Cricket Match just to enjoy a Bachelors day together before Ajay's marriage. Later They accidental will get trapped in some Serious problems. This is another Full and Full Comedy Movie.* The Dialoge about the Maturity of Friends by One Character's Wife is very Similar in both the Movies. * Characters are almost Similar like One idiotic Friend who frequently says some Funny One-liner (Alan) and the Combination of Friends are also same like 2 Brothers and 2 Friends. * The Vehicle they starts has Importance in both the Movies before they get in to the same.Movie Name: 2 Harihar Nagar Language: Malayalam Actors: Mukesh, Asokan, Jagadish, Siddique Release Date: 1st April, 20092 Hariharnagar (Plot)- Four Friends - One is Extremely Idiot. Friends are Mahadevan, Govindan, Appukuttan and Thomas Kutty. Everybody except Thomas is Married, they came for Thomas's marriage function. They decided to Enjoy few Days as Bachelors just before Marriage. After Few Incidents just when they decide to go back, they comes to know one of their Friend is Missing and thats Thomas who is getting married within Hours.! Out of 4 Friends.* One is a Person who takes Seminar and In Hangover its A Teacher. Both are persons who takes classes. * Intro of both the Characters are Same, One is taking Seminars for Kids and the other one is Taking Class for Kids. * The Person who is getting to Married will get Missing in both the Movies - but for Different Reasons. * One of the Friend's Character is a Dentist in both. * The Dentist frequently says he is a Doctor to strangers in both Films. * And all the Time one of his Friend reveals to the stranger that 'he is not a Doctor but a Dentist' - in Both the Movies. * One of the Friend who is idiotic says some funny stupid One Liner comment many times.This is Crazy, 2 Hariharnagar and The Hangover is only 2 Months gap, a Hollywood Movie cannot be taken within that 1 or 2 Months! So hope its not a Copy but the Similarities are not so Crazy. Its Cristal clearly. So!! And Saroja - the Movie itself is inspired from another Hollywood movie 'Judgement Night'. Was released one year prior to both the above mentioned movies but still 2 Hariharnagar cannot be said as a Copy or Inspired from another movie because its the Same Characters from the PART 1 of Trilogy Hariharnagar earlier part was released 1990. The Movie is all mixed up.",8,1,2,27 September 2010
3 Idiots," Simple and A Walk to your own Good old 'Happy Days' - A Review by Myreviews
","3 Idiots are the three roommates. The Story revolves around them, their college life, Happiness and sadness, Loses etc.. One of the Idiot is actually a Genius, And he was not able to adjust with formal and usual education system rather he prefer to learn from around the world.The Movie slaps our Education system, this movie raises many questions which are reasonable. The Movie is a look back to our own College life. You will feel that you want to be in the college again, one more time or else you wish, at least the movie should have released when you were in College. You will enjoy with the 3 Idiots, cry with them and and will laugh with them. You will enjoy every moment of the movie. Its a blessing to have friends like that and a look back to our own Happy Days. The film starts from 'Good' and Ends at 'Superb'. Rajkumar Hirani, yes he did it again. and This is a Movie every Student and parents should see before going to a School.Aamir Khan is out there and shines bright. Yet again, he had come up with very impressive performance and the film shows his Dedication. Madhavan - Very Convincing and have good Screen space where he did well with his natural Comic One Liner so as Sharmaan Joshi. Kareena Kapoor is beautiful and very good in a Girl with small brain.Negatives: Yes the movies has many, though not as many as pluses. The Delivery scene was too much to accept and adjust. - Only unwanted scene in the movie. And in Direction / Screenplay point of view, This time Director had compromised a lot more than he does for Munnabhai Series. Comedy is very enjoyable but looses reality in few scenes and the Most laughable scene (Chatur's Hindi Speech) is more like a Comic and little lengthy. And Have you ever heard or seen a Dean of the College coming in a Cycle?@, that too 'A College which ranks the Highest for Higher Studies' as mentioned in the movie.At the End - the Movie is very Entertaining and can be rated as the most enjoyable Hindi movie of the Decade or 2 Decades or can increase few more.",9,2,5,5 October 2010
