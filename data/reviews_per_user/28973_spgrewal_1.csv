Scarface," To all those who have given this film too low of a rating
","I consider this film to be truly influential in my life. I have read negative reviews regarding this film and I think that the people are interpreting this film in a very wrong perspective. It is not meant to be about complex storytelling (like the Godfather/Goodfellas), or be cinametically influential. Its about Tony Montana, the protagonist, all about him...his attitudes. He is the representation of the human spirit that can accomplish anything and overcome any obstacle. I think most immigrants/people of low socio-economic status get inspired by his ambition. This movie does not advocate to sell drugs, but to make it big in America in any legitimate business(real estate, sales, whatever). It is not meant to be taken literally every second, but you need to develop genuine respect for his mentality, attitude, beliefs, and everything about him. His character is so developed, and encompasses a time that was accurate in that period.",10,2,4,19 February 2009
