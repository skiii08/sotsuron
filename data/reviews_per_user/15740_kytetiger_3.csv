Skyfall," 1 word to describe this movie: beautiful
","+ acting of Craig, Dench & Bardem are superb. They live the characters, give them weight and credibility. + story is self aware, contemporary and kind of logical. It questions the existence of MI6 and it works really well. + 1 word to describe this movie; beautiful: set pieces are creative and refined, camera are stable, there is a thinking before each shooting, great work on the colours, the editing takes his time giving more of an ambiance, opening title is subtle + lots of references to the Bond mytho, in a good and funny way + Script and dialogs marvelously written. We sens each persons, and the text implied a lot of things.<ul><li>Harris &amp; Marlohe are not that good (well, they are Bond girls so we are used to that level) - Music is sometime edited in a harsh way (good and bad), and music aren't really good (too cliché, not outstanding), Adèle's theme song lack a melody in the refrain and the original music isn't really melodious. - 3 great parts, but the climax isn't that strong - FX are weak, like coming from 2005 :/</li></ul>8,5/10, as good as Casino Royale, but in a totally different way.",8,2,12,2 November 2012
Oblivion," A nice movie to watch, but far from being an innovator in the field of science fiction.
","Oblivion (2013)Jake and Vika are technicians responsible for ensuring the proper functioning of drones on the Earth's surface in 2073, ravaged after a disaster.***Attention, this review may contain spoilers***The premises are told at from the beginning of the film and we follow , the technician Jack, walking on the surface of the grid 49, equivalent to the former island of Manhattan, rediscovering, remembering and experiencing nostalgia for the lost memories of human civilization. There are many references throughout the film over typical entertainment from the city, and we feel happily the reflection from the passions of our dear Tom (Amercian Football, motorcycle, Yankees, etc.).. He plays less extravagantly, but offers us an enjoyable game.It also allows us to see at the same time the establishing of the character of Jack. He is curious and open. He is smart and has a good mind. This aspect is crucial in the development of character and in his quest for truth. So we follow with a singular eye the story, all the intrigues and revelations.There are two-three mysterious scenes and others with very high tensions, but the overall pace suffers from many tractions, involving a loss of speed and generally causing a slight boredom in the audience (people were complaining aloud during the film premier at the BIFFF).Joseph Kosinski has the merit of having artistic taste, and each of its scenes are clean, well made and very enjoyable to watch. There is no crappy assembly and trembling, and the scenes aboard the small ship are pleasant. There are many shots of landscape and they are strongly reminiscent of Ridley Scott's style, for example the beginning of Prometheus.The music is rhythmic and has a broad spectrum, but the melodies, very simplistic, very strongly resemble the themes of the Batman trilogy from Nolan, and background music from Mass Effect. It is impersonal, but it still gives an enchanting effect with the finished product. Sound effects are average, and there are too much of small these overused useless little noise from all the devices (a simple lens doesn't make a sound, stop it Hollywood).The course of history is interesting, but the final feeling is disturbing. There is no originality. Furthermore, we face numerous times a deus ex, cutting net the momentum, the threat of danger and the tension of the scene, Jack feels less like a subject, but more like a passive character. It is at first delighting to find the revelations and reversals of situations, but we quickly realize that this is déjà vu. This film is much like a mash-up of, among others, Wall-E, Star Wars, Matrix, Indepence Day, The Island, Mad Max ...I also regret that Morgan Freeman did finally appear only for ten minutes throughout the film, and that the character of Julia, played by a charming Olga Kurylenko, has almost no interaction with the other characters, being more like an extension of the character of Jack. As for Vika, she remains a stereotypical female character and neurotic.A nice movie to watch, but far from being an innovator in the field of science fiction.7/10",7,8,21,9 April 2013
Prometheus," Thanks Mr Scott
","What can I add to all the other reviews here next to mine?I'll just sum the goods and bads:+Good use of the 3D, where the holograms and dust float in front and behind characters, coupled with a solid and beautiful design. the camera is steady, with a clean picture. +Outstanding performance from Fassbender who steals the movie. He got the little changing expressions that makes you believe. Theron and Rapace are interesting in their roles and sometime give good plays. +Sound and music transports you. +new approach for explaining the Alien and the origins (see below) +Ridley just re-appropriating his own product and-just transcend all the alien franchise's mythology by taking a new kind of opposite angle -A lot of characters lack depth. - I still question some of the Hollywood necessary influence in some part of practicality in some places (the volume inside the ship, uses of light inside the helmet, some texts, ideas) -a certain turning plot that is questionable and just lack the appropriate response. -Science level equals a 12 year old kid's knowledge.***Attention Spoilers!***This is my explanation for the evolution of the Alien:The black liquid is a weapon of mass destruction that destroys a subject (black marks, cells explodes) but can recreate afterward a new species depending on the host. This means that the Alien we are used to know (2 arms, 2 legs, etc)exists only because the black liquid has infected a Human DNA. If the black liquid infects a worm, the 'alien' would be some kind of worm. If it infects some furry ball animal, the 'alien' would be some hairy furry alien...?! ***End of Spoiler***",7,10,22,31 May 2012
