Black Swan," Dancing with the Stars
","I just got back from watching 'The Black Swan' and am still sorting out my feelings about it. Most of the way, it was borderline unwatchable, mostly about people mutilating themselves mentally and physically. Then it got very dramatic but kind of over the top with a seeming triumph but by that time you don't know what was real and what wasn't: you don't know whether to be 'uplifted' or not. It has some of my favorite actresses in it- Natalie Portman, Winona Ryder, Barbara Hershey and Mila Kunis, who I'd only seen in the lightweight 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' and 'Date Night', (both of which were a lot more fun to watch than this). All gave terrific performances. Portman, who was also great as Anne Boleyn in 'The Other Boleyn Girl', has matured into a major actress. But Hershey is probably the best thing in the movie as the loving but somehow threatening mother. Kunis gives the film the only charm it has and hits all the right notes in her limited but important role. Ryder's appearance made me sad because a decade ago she might have played Portman's role, (although she doesn't really have a ballet dancer's body). Her career never really recovered from her shop-lifting arrest, although she's made some interesting smaller films. I may be interpreting this wrong but I'm not alone, (judging from the IMDb) in seeing her role as the aging ballerina being angrily 'retired' as paralleling her own career. Comparisons are being made to prior films- one that keeps cropping up is 'Showgirls', another movie that may not be as 'good' as this one but was more fun to watch. Some are comparing it to the same director's 'Requiem for a Dream', about people who are falling apart due to drug use, (and who also lose touch with reality, as does the audience,). That was another unpleasant one. Id have to say that this is a movie you should see if you want to make sure you have an opinion about who should have won which award. But if you're looking for a good time, skip it.",7,5,12,19 December 2010
Mission: Impossible III," Too much Cruise, not enough Schifrin, as usual
","The TV show, which I loved, was about outsmarting people. The IMF was a government sponsored confidence team whose job it was to manipulate events in such a way as to thwart and get rid of the bad guys without anybody even knowing they existed. They use some gadgets but mostly impersonate people to set things up so that they didn't even need to be there for things to play out the way they wanted. They hardly ever used violence and their plots never came down to a car chase, a firefight or a boxing match between the head of the team and the bad guy. That would have been way too sloppy. They would be clinking champagne glasses, knowing 'Our work here is done' while Lalo Schrifin's classic theme, which had followed them throughout, accenting their every move, began to play in an upbeat mode in celebration of their achievement. They made their impossible missions seem very possible while the audience wondered what it must be like to be that clever.The movies are about a government sponsored high-tech commando team that uses force to achieve their goals, including Spiderman-like stunts, video-game-like chases, explosions, firefights and duke-outs with the bad guys, all of which would advertise their presence to the world and likely negate anything they accomplish while signing their own death warrants. Obviously a decision was made that this is what the public wants in its action films and that it would find a tradition Mission: Impossible story too boring.I don't find the movies boring but I do find them exhausting and not very satisfying. What I would have liked is for the first half of the film to a sort of biography of the villain, showing how he became what he was and how he formed his plan for what he wants to do that makes him, (or it could be her), such a threat. Then have the IMF head show up in the middle and get his assignment in some imaginative way, pull together his team, (and let's find out who these people actually are and what interesting things they do when they aren't on assignment-remember that in the TV show they all had other professions), and then run a con that foils the villain, who never knew what hit him.But the conventional wisdom is that you have to give your audience their first glimpse of the star immediately and these films are all about conventional wisdom. Unfortunately the conventional wisdom didn't include the liberal use of Schifrin's classic theme, which appears slightly at the beginning and over the closing credits of MI:3. I recall in the first movie that the use of the theme over the final action sequence, (its only use in the film), brought the loudest ovation I've ever heard in a movie theater.That sequence illustrates the problem with the movies better than anything. The bad guy arranges to exchange the MacGuffin for money on the bullet train as its heading for the Chunnel. He then climbs to the top of the speeding train to grab a ladder dropped from a trailing helicopter just before they get to the Chunnel. Does that sound like something a genius would think up? Does any of it in any of the three movies? The impossible has been replaced by the improbable.",5,54,100,7 May 2006
Marie Antoinette," Where's the rest of her?
","This film is enjoyable enough for what it is: basically a character study of a misunderstood 'villianess' of history. It makes you wonder who else isn't as bad as people said they were, and who wasn't so good, (Gore Vidal has made a career of this).But two huge things are missing: the French Revolution and Marie Antoinette's greatest moments. The revolution is simply something that happens to Marie Antoinette. It doesn't happen to France. We don't get to see any of the conditions which caused it. It's just represented by a mob at the end. I guess this is absent because Marie herself never saw it: we are seeing just what she saw. But who says a film has to maintain only one perspective? We hear of some of the mean things critics are saying about Marie and how what we now call a propaganda machine was trying to destroy her. But we see nothing of the propagandists and their motivations. We see nothing of their effect on a crowd of starving, frustrated people. Why not jump back and forth to contrast the Queen's life with the state of the nation? And, of course the entire period of her captivity and her attempts to save her family are removed from the story. The death of two children even before the revolution is reduced to one- in one scene. The fate of her youngest son who 'reigned' after the death of his father is unmentioned.Versalles has a famous Hall of Mirrors. In this film, we are just looking into one of them. Where is the rest of the story?",6,2,4,28 April 2007
Finding Neverland," Neverland and Oz
","This is not a great film but in the cacophony of cinematic noise, I find it hard to complain about a sweetly sentimental film that deals intelligently with the question of how to face life and then death. Johnny Depp is probably the finest actor of his generation because of his ability to find poetry and whimsy in his characters while remaining a strong, confident screen presence. Kate Winslett is a luminous presence and fine actress in her own right. They boys are exceptional, especially Freddie Highmore, who plays the troubled child Barrie based Peter upon. The thing that holds the movie back from greatness is the sub-plots. Barries' wife and Winslett's mother are both stiff, unimaginative people who are unable to go where Barrie can go and seem to dislike him for it. Mary Barrie, (Rahda Mitchell), seems more interested in social climbing and Emma Du Maurier, (Julie Christie wants to protect her daughter from the riffraff. It's not very interesting.The film occasionally moves from reality to fantasy without recognizing any borders between the two. In that sense it resembles 'Big Fish', which did this more aggressively and is more enjoyable. More time in 'Neverland' rather than an occasional stroboscopic visit would have been nice.Another film people might want to see if they liked this one is the TV movie 'The Dreamer of Oz', about Barrie's American contemporary, L. Frank Baum, who, according to that film, created Oz as a place for his beloved, (and deceased ) niece Dorothy to reside. It's always interested me that Barrie and Baum had different conclusions at the end of their stories. Barrie held that remaining stuck in 'reality' was a prison sentence and that we needed to fly off to find ourselves. Baum, who traveled far and wide looking for happiness only to wish he was back in his home town of Chittenango, concluded that for all our longings, there is no place like home.",Null,0,0,5 December 2004
Memento," The problem is more interesting than the movie
","Every time I praised a movie this year, someone would tell me 'but you haven't seen 'Memento''. Well, now I've seen it. Firstly, I note this site, (but not the box), identifies this as a '2000' film. This would explain why it was snubbed for the 2001 Oscars. Beyond that, It is not the best film I've seen from 2001, ('In the Bedroom' is). It's certainly an interesting film, (and I don't mean that to be the left handed compliment it normally is), as the hero has a most interesting problem. He has to find the killer of his wife despite his loss of short term memory, which he combats by making notes, taking pictures and even tattooing things he doesn't want to forget onto his body. It would be a great premise for a TV show. But it makes for an emotionally antiseptic movie, hardly comparable to 'A Beautiful Mind', 'Monster's Ball' or 'In the Bedroom', films that were much more emotionally involving. The hero of this doesn't know what's happened and so his personality lacks depth. And he turns out not to have been much of a hero anyway. I like a movie I'm still thinking about days later. I've forgotten this one already.",Null,0,3,9 March 2002
This Is the End," I missed the end of This is The End
","There are so many apocalyptic movies out these days I decided that if I was going to see one, I wanted it to be a comedy. So I went to see 'This is the End', which supposedly about the end of the world as seen by some Hollywood types, playing themselves, sort of. I thought it would be a spoof of those other movies and of Hollywood. Sounded good. Instead 90% was about a bunch of unpleasant people holed up in James Franco's house deciding to live it up as best they can with drugs, booze and the little remaining food, further fortified with plenty of sex and bathroom humor. One guy is angry because he didn't even want to go to Franco's party and now he's stuck there with a bunch of people he doesn't like. I empathized with him totally. I never laughed once, although I did crack half a smile at one line,(but forgot what it is). The other people there kind of snickered once. I suspect the writers and maybe the actors were as high as their characters when they made the film and I the audience would have to be the same to enjoy it as much as they did. Maybe they should have passed joints out with the tickets like those 3D Glasses. It may have a great, hilarious ending I missed. But I kept looking at my watch, (which seemed to be having a losing battle with the space-time continuum), and inventorying the many things I would rather be doing than watching this flick. I finally decided to do them.",1,6,17,28 June 2013
12 Angry Men," 1954 vs. 1957
","The Archive of American Television has finally come out with a DVD version of the original Studio One teleplay, '12 Angry Men' by Reginald Rose, directed by Franklyn J. Schaffner, who did many Studio Ones and much later was the director of 'Patton'. I can now compare it to the famous movie version, starring Henry Fonda, which was directled by Sidney Lumet three years later. A lot of the things Lumet gets credited for in some of these reviews are already present in Schaffner's staging, including starting with the high camera angle and ending with the close-ups.A key difference is that the TV version is only an hour long, (actually only 50 minutes due to commercials), while the film uses 96 minutes to tell its story. Some of the lesser characters suffer as a result. In the film Robert Webber's nice-guy businessman wants so much to go along with anybody else that he changes his vote simply to be part of the majority when the tide turns. In the Teleplay, we never learn why Will West changes his mind. Edward Binns as juror #6, is very protective of 'the old man', Juror #9, (played by Joseph Sweeney in both versions), in the movie. He clearly sees him as a similar to his own elderly but beloved father. In the teleplay, Bart Burns is little more than a spectator, except for one key moment that has nothing to do with the old man.But the big difference is in the lead actor, Robert Cummings, (He was 'Bob' in a comedy, 'Robert in a drama'), vs. Henry Fonda in the film. Fonda is, of course, an actor of much greater repute but Cummings was much underrated. He was a thoughtful actor in dramas, carefully weighing his words and inviting the audience to think along with him. As Juror#8, Cummings portrays a man who is not sure of himself as the beginning but wants to answer some key questions before he makes a decision. In the film, Fonda seems like a man who has already decided to vote 'not guilty' from the beginning and is trying to figure out how to loosen up his fellow jurors from their stances so he can draw them over to his view of things. A key point is that fact that the lady who 'saw' the murder through the windows of the train wore glasses. In the film, Fonda divines this by noting how E.G. Marshall, as juror #4 rubs his nose to deal with the irritation the glasses cause. It's the final piece to the mosaic Fonda is trying to create. In the teleplay, it is Burns' juror #6 who makes this point after watching juror #2 and this seems to be the final piece of the puzzle for Cummings who for the first time, has become firm in his decision to vote not guilty.His two antagonists are jurors #3 and #10. #10 is Edward Arnold in the teleplay, Ed Begley in the film. Both are good. The scene where #10 is ranting on about 'people like that' is more effective in the film. It's just a matter of timing. On TV, the jurors get up and begin to walk away as soon as he starts talking. In the movie they do so more slowly, each one making the decision on his own. Franchot Tone, another underrated actor, (he started out playing charming men about town and wound up playing garrulous old timers), is just as strong and forceful as Lee J. Cobb. His true motivation, his resentment of his own son, is hinted at early but is not part of his breakdown at the end. In fact, he doesn't break down at all. He simply surrenders. He doesn't become Cobb's 'shell of a man'.As to the other jurors, Martin Balsam has more to do than Norman Fell as juror #1, the foreman. Martin's a nice guy who just wants everybody to get along. We don't' know that much about Norman. John Beal's role as juror #2 just calls for him to use his watch to time Cummings' performance as the old man walking and to wipe his glasses clean at the right time. Marshall came through a little stronger than Walter Abel as a relentless 'logic machine' who can't think outside the box. Lee Phillips is solid as the shy young man, somewhat ashamed of coming from a disadvantaged background. Burns has little to do besides noting the significance of Beal's glasses. Paul Hartman is OK as the guy who wants to leave early, (he has tickets to the theater, not a ballgame). Much of the additional dialog in the movie goes to Jack Warden's version of this character. Sweeney and George Voskovic are the only two actors in both versions and both are fine, with Voskovic underlining the significance of this procedure to someone who came here to experience freedom. Missing though, is his empathy for the defendant as an outsider like him, which is emphasized in the film. West, as indicated, is a non-entity in the teleplay.On the whole, I'll take the movie over the TV original but it's a close thing. But the TV version, which was 'missing' for many years, is certainly worth seeing.",10,0,0,28 November 2008
The Other Boleyn Girl," Anne Boleyn as Lady Macbeth
","I didn't read the book, although I have read some of the history, and found myself blown away by 'The Other Boleyn Girl'. What blew me away was Natalie Portman's awesome performance as the tragically ambitious Anne, whose scheming creates a slippery slope that sends her into desperation and almost to madness before she literally loses her head. I had always regarded her as a great beauty and a charming performer but in this film Ms. Portman becomes a great actress. People have said the film concentrates too much on Anne but it really doesn't. Natalie just so dominates the film you think she's in every scene. She's just in every scene you care about. Hopefully Oscar voters will still care about her a year from now. With the heavy criticism of the film and its lack of box office success, they may not.The problem, of course is that the film, historically, is nonsense. Every indication is that Anne Boleyn was not like this, (Wikipedia has some very good discussions of this). And if she wasn't the film is not merely inaccurate but a libel on her character. The question is: do we simply accept this and 'go with the flow' so we can enjoy the story? Or do we condemn the film and everything in it because of the liberties it takes? Portman blows away every other Anne Boleyn that I've ever seen but the comparison seems unfair because she wasn't really playing Anne Boleyn. She was playing Lady Macbeth, (and showing she'd be very good at it if it ever came to that).Anne Boleyn seems to be kind of like General Custer- her portrayal depends on the political climate of the moment and the agenda of the writer. The same could be said of the criticism of the portrayals. Many of the alleged inaccuracies are open to debate, (see Wikipedia on the book itself). Perhaps it's best just to look at it as a story and enjoy the blossoming of a great talent. If you have to read the book to find out it's a bad movie and you have to read history to find out it's a bad book, why do either?",8,0,1,13 April 2008
L.A. Confidential," So Just What Are the Facts, Ma'm?
","Dragnet, Mulholland Falls and L.A. Confidential	I've done some reading over the years about Dragnet. Jack Webb was making a movie called 'He Walked by Night' in 1948 when the technical advisor, LAPD detective Marty Wynn, expressed exasperation that Hollywood never depicted police work as it actually was. the cops were always hard boiled tough guys, crooked or buffoons. Webb, after thinking about it, asked to accompany Wynn and his partner, Vance Brasher on their nightly rounds and became fascinated by police procedure and the way the real policemen talked. He suggested the radio series that became 'Dragnet'. The LAPD was enthusiastic because they found the way they were constantly being depicted as distasteful. Webb's police went by the book, spoke 'like doctors would to patients'. He also eschewed violence except in rare instances, usually showing it after it had taken place and depicting it as the human tragedy it actually was. Webb closely co-operated with the LAPD, using their files for stories and filling his shows with praise for Chief William Parker, who had been hired in 1950 to clean up and give a new image to the department. 	The Watts riots were the first chink in this image. Many analysts blamed them on Parker and his department, which was said to enforce racist unofficial rules about which part of town blacks could be in. In recent years, two films have been released which seem to further undercut the image of the LAPD that Webb created, Mulholland Falls, (1996) and L.A. Confidential, (1997). Mulholland Falls introduces us to the 'Hat Squad', which is said to be non-fictional. Nick Nolte and his gang report directly to Chief Parker, (who is played briefly but perfectly by Bruce Dern, judging from newsreel clips I saw on his biography). He hired them to rid the city of mobsters and other criminals and to stay above politics. Nobody, but nobody is allowed to operate in L.A., not even the FBI, without going through Parker. The Hat Squad makes their own rules to do their job, including throwing a would-be mobster, (played by CSI's William Peterson), off a cliff on Mulholland Drive they have given the title name.	In L.A. Confidential, the Hat Squad and Chief Parker do not make an appearance, although I wonder if James Cromwell's Capt. Smith is somehow supposed to represent him. We are introduced here to Jack Vincennes, who is a technical advisor on a show obviously intended to represent Dragnet, the star of which is a total phony. Russell Crowe's Bud White would look good in a hat and Guy Pearce's Ed Exley seems to have watched too many episodes of Dragnet. 	These two films suggest that Dragnet was a phony, too, a public relations gimmick to make the seedy LAPD look good. Recent events have also not helped the image of the department, suggesting that planting evidence to help along prosecution and prejudice against African Americans is a long-standing condition. Maybe those melodramas of the 40's had it right about the LAPD.	But books about Jack Webb tell about him doing such extensive research into not only the methods of the department but also the details of a cop's life. I suspect that even Chief Parker could not have protected the Hat Squad once they attacked and brutally beat up an FBI agent, as Nick Nolte does. And are we to believe that Mickey Cohen was brought to justice so the LAPD could take over his rackets? Was there ever an Alamo-like shoot out between good cops and bad cops? Was it that bad? Or is Hollywood simply reclaiming the territory won by Jack Webb in Dragnet? 	There are people who know. But I am not one of them.",Null,0,1,11 March 2002
The Prestige," Modern Magicians
","I agree with those who have said that 'The Illusionist' and 'The Prestige' are not really comparable just because they are stories of magicians in the Victorian Era, (although I think 'The Prestige' must be Edwardian because Nikola Tesla didn't move to Colorado Springs until 1899). But you can learn about films by comparing them to similar films and the temptation to make the comparison is great. When I rent films, I usually rent two at time because I figure one of them is bound to be better than the other. I find it interesting to rent films that have some relation to each other: the original and the remake or the sequel; two films with the same actor or director or author; two top films from the same year, or two films in the same genre. These two were an ideal mix.They are both well made and have interesting stories. The big difference is that 'The Illusionist' is a romantic caper film and 'The Prestige' is a dark examination of rivalry and revenge. The characters in the first are more likable and the story more palatable. I enjoyed the film more. The acting is a mixed bag: Edward Norton gives a performance that is restrained to the point of being flat. Jessica Biel is adequate. Rufus Sewell is fine and Paul Giamatti again dominates a good picture, although someone should tell him that the old theatrical scene-stealing technique of whispering your lines went out with Oliver Reed. Christian Bale dominates every scene with Hugh Jackman. He just has more gravitas. Michael Caine is Michael Caine, which is fine. Scarlett Johansson is Scarlett Johanssen, which is OK.What's interesting is the reaction of some fans that magic tricks that are the result of trick photography or CGI somehow are disappointing. The cinema did not evolve from the theater or from novels. It evolved from magic. Its predecessor was the 'magic lantern show', which used some of the same concepts of projected images and the simulation of motion, was used first by magicians and not story-tellers. The works of Georges Méliès were those of a magician, not a novelist. If Eisenheim, Borden or Angier where here today, I think they'd all approve of the magic show these films represent. Then they'd probably become filmmakers themselves.",6,0,2,27 March 2007
The Aviator," A Life is Not a Movie
","Some people are grousing that this film departs from history in certain ways, such as by exaggerating the depth and length of Howard Hughes' relationship with Katherine Hepburn. A life is not a movie. It's a jumble of various events in lives that collide together in an almost random fashion. To make a film you have to assemble those events into a cogent story. That's going to mean telescoping time, creating composite characters and fictional scenes that have at least an element of truth and move the story along. Martin Scorsese, as usual, has done that brilliantly. A nearly three hour film flies by without ever becoming boring.It does, however become depressing. This is the story of a genius, (an egotistical, overbearing one but nonetheless a genius) who becomes undone by mental illness. Despite being the protagonist, Hughes is never really a sympathetic character. He's tragic but there's no attempt made to get the audience to like him. And the scenes of his mental entropy are painful but not at all touching. I did wonder how they were going to end this thing and the combination of success- the flight of the 'spruce goose'- with another attack while Hughes mumbles about the future is excellent. Achievements were in his past, not his future.DeCaprio forever banishes any idea that he was just the latest pretty boy. I never imagined that he could play Howard Hughes but he becomes Howard Hughes. If anything, he's more convincing in the final scenes when Hughes was much older that DeCaprio than in the early ones when he was close to Leonardo's present age. Leonardo DeCaprio is a legitimately. The Oscar will be between him and another performer who 'became' his character- Jaime Foxx. They were both great.As to the other performers, Cate Blanchett does about as well as you can trying to play the great Kate Hepburn, (this film is awash in Kates- or Cates). Kate Beckinsale is fine as Ava Gardner, who shows up before she should have. Why they spent the money to get Jude Law to play Errol Flynn, I don't know. He's just window dressing. Perhaps he had some scenes that wound up on the cutting room floor. Alec Baldwin is adequate as Hughes' rival, Juan Trippe, who created Pam Am Airlines. Alan Alda does a good job with another one of his 'cast against type' roles as a corrupt Senator.It's an impressive but not really enjoyable film that still may good enough to win a lot of awards, including Scorsese's elusive first Oscar. If the Red Sox can do it.",Null,3,9,25 December 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," An Adventure is a Disaster you Survive
","That's what it's like in real life, anyway. In 'reel life', adventures are supposed to be fun. And this one just isn't. Technologically, it's probably the greatest film ever made, miles ahead of George Lucas dreadful Star Wars prequel, with it's army of walking skeletons. The film is symphony of visual images that will sweep you away, at least when you first see them. But then you start to look for a little something more and it isn't there.
Star Wars, (the original), had the cocky Han Solo and the humorous C3P0 and R2D2, (spare us Jar Jar Binks in the next one, George). The Three Musketeers gave us Athos, Porthos and Aremis, with their joy of life and es spirit de corps. This movie is best characterized by the scene in the cave where the heros, (who don't even seem to like each other), have dispatched one creature and one of them says 'What Horror Awaits us Next?'. This is much more like a protracted horror movies than a cinematic adventure. You just try and survive each scene. The deaths are grisly. There is no humor, (save for a tasteless inside joke about dwarf-throwing), and no sense of fun. Audiences identify with heroes who have confidence and these guys look as if they don't think they are going to make it through the next scene. This wears on you and drains the life out of the movie. It deserves every technical Oscar but lacks the entertainment value to be a really great movie.",Null,0,0,2 March 2002
The Caine Mutiny," Quite a Crew
","One of the pleasures of viewing movies made in the 1950's is seeing all the familiar faces. Many of the actors us baby boomers grew up watching on TV got some of their first big chances in the 'A' movies of the 50's. Aboard the Caine, (or, at least, in the movies) are: Fred MacMurray of 'My Three Sons', (already a star, of course), Warner Anderson and Tom Tully of 'The Line-Up' E.G. Marshall of 'The Defenders', Lee Marvin of 'M Squad', Claude Akins of 'Movin' On' and 'Sheriff Lobo', Jerry Paris of 'The Dick Van Dyke Show', Herbert Anderson of 'Dennis the Menace', James Best of 'Dukes of Hazard', Robert Bray of 'Stagecoach West', as well as frequent TV guest actors such as Whit Bissell, Arthur Franz, Steve Brodie and Don Dubbins. There's also Kenneth McDonald, one of Perry Mason's favorite judges, playing, naturally, a judge. It's the type of movie where every role, no matter how small, is played by someone who makes it memorable.Of course, the stars shine. This is one of Humphrey Bogart's most famous performances. He covers all the bases, showing Queeg as a reasonable man when not under stress but a fanatical micro-manager when he feels himself losing his grip. MacMurray, for the second of three times in his career, turns his 'nice guy' persona inside out. The others are 'Double Indemnity' and 'The Apartment'. (In the first the author was Cain. In the second the ship was the Caine. In the third they raised cain.) Van Johnson, a much underrated actor has the best, (but not the only good) role of his career as the true blue Navy guy who gets swayed by MacMurray into risking his career. The unfortunate Robert Francis, who died in a plane crash the next year, is a rather stiff actor but his earnestness seems to fit his inexperienced character, (even has it totally fails him in the romantic scenes in the pointless subplot). Had he lived he probably would have had a Tab Hunter/Troy Donahue type career. This film would probably have been his peek in any case.The measure of a great film is if you project yourself into it, having conversations with the characters and wondering what you would say or do. This film sucks you into it about as much as any. What would you have said to Captain Queeg when he called that meeting? (I'd have asked him what he meant by 'constructive loyalty'.) I'm also impressed by a movie that doesn't give me what I expected. Trial movies are supposed to either be about heroic prosecutors bringing dangerous criminals to justice or about heroic defense attorneys protecting their innocent clients from a miscarriage of justice. Here we have a lawyer who would rather be the prosecutor and a 'victory' that is really a tragedy.By the way, I know of three actors who adopted the names of characters they played, (there may be more). Dawn O'Day changed her name to Anne Shirley when she played Anne Shirley in 'Anne of Green Gables' (1934). Byron Barr morphed into Gig Young when he played Gig Young in 'The Gay Sisters' (1942) and Donna Lee Hickey became May Wynn for this picture. Thus, 'May Wynn' is playing 'May Wynn'.One last thought: I wonder if Humphrey Bogart's 'Caine' ever passed by Jimmy Cagney's 'Reluctant' during its travels.",9,8,15,17 March 2006
Cold Mountain," The Eyes Have It
","Originally, this film was to be a Tom Cruise-Nicole Kidman vehicle. With their split, they had to find another actor and they hit the jackpot with Jude Law, perhaps the finest young actor of his generation. Law is an abnormally handsome man but his huge, intense eyes convey much more than prettiness. He can play an off-balance character such as the assassin in `The Road to Perdition' or he can play a war-weary soldier, as he did in `Enemy at the Gates and here. Amid all the beautiful and horrible images of this film, it is Law's eyes that linger in the memory.Nearly as good is Nicole Kidman as the subject of his dreams. I much prefer this nuanced performance as the southern belle who learns how to take care of herself to her short turn with the long nose in last year's `The Hours'. Oscars are being given out for superficial things these days. Alter your appearance or play someone with a `condition' and the Academy will beat a path to your door. Play a three dimensional human being without any props and you get taken for granted. One complaint: in the love scene with Law, she's a little too dolled up. Notice that her hair is in curls in the scene and, (more logically), straighter and drabber in the adjoining scenes.
Rene Zellweger has the showiest role. I have no complaints about her performance but I did not find anything special about it. Her function in the story is to cut through the romance and bring it back down to earth, as she does during the lover's reunion. She does this well but again I'm more impressed with Kidman's more subtle work. Zellweger is basically Calamity Jane on grits. The episodic film is full of fine performances by supporting actors. Maybe the whole cast should be given a `best supporting actor' award. Brendan Gleason, Kathy Baker, James Gammon, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Eileen Atkins stand out, as do ex-child stars Natalie Portman and Jena Malone as young women who are trying their best to survive in a hostile environment.That hostile environment somewhat reduces the entertainment value of the film. This is a war and this is the 19th century. We see a graphic presentation of the most terrible battle of the Civil War, the `Battle of the Crater' at Petersburg where the Union army dug a tunnel under the Confederate lines and filled it with dynamite. After the blast, the Federals charged into the gap in a poorly executed attack that trapped their men in the Crater. The Rebs surrounded the hole and slaughtered the attackers. That's hardly the end of the killing and much of the cast gets blown away, (or bayoneted) by the end of it. Also a woman gets tortured and another raped. Finally, several animals are killed and slaughtered although these images are much more disturbing to us in the 21st century than they would have been to those who lived in the 19th century.

North by Northwest," Leave your brain home
","(SPOILERS- if you've been living it in a cave)OK, now explain this to me. Eva Marie Saint tells Cary Grant to go out to this 'middle of nowhere' spot to meet the actually non-existent agent he is after who will explain everything that has been happening to him. He's let off in the middle of this endless road and waits. Nothing happens. Then he notices a crop-dusting plane buzzing away in the distance. A guy drives up, stops for a moment for a smoke and then observes that there are no crops to dust. Then he leaves and Cary, having nothing else to contemplate, keeps looking at the plane. It then starts flying toward him and he slowly realizes it is going to try to clip him with its wings. He dives to the ground to avoid it. Then the same thing happens. Then the plane suddenly starts shooting machine gun bullets at him. He runs to a cornfield, (there are crops!) where the plane tries to fertilize him to death. Then he sees a tank truck coming down the road and tries to flag the driver down who decides to run over him instead. Then the plane flies into the tank truck and they both explode while Grant manages to escape.Questions: 1) Why does Eva send Cary there? She's working for Leo Carroll, so she must know the agent Cary is chasing doesn't exist. Is it just to protect her cover? 2) Would the bad guys really have come up with such a ridiculous method of dispensing with the hero?3) How is the death supposed to be an 'accident', as they presumably want people to think, especially if machine gun bullets are used?4) If the pilot has a machine gun, why doesn't he use it from the beginning?5) Why does the pilot fly his plane into the tank truck? Was this so impossible to avoid?The film is a lot of fun. But leave your brain home.",Null,3,6,16 May 2004
Van Helsing," Whatever happened to building to the big ending?
","Whatever happened to building to the big ending?I watched `North By Northwest' a week ago, a film that was generally regarded as the best `action thriller' ever made to that point, (1959). It has, basically, three action scenes. The first is a semi-comical trip down a highway after the bad guys have kidnapped Cary Grant, drugged him up and put him in a car so he will crash and die. That comes about 15 minutes into the film. Most of an hour later comes the famous `Crop duster scene' where an innocent looking plane tries to do Cary in by clipping him with it's wings, machine gunning him and then fertilizing him to death before crashing in a ball of flame. Then, about half hour later, we get the famous escape over Mount Rushmore, where they wind up clinging to George Washington's nose. The rest of the film is a cat and mouse game between Cary and the bad guys and a romance between him and Eva Marie Saint. The whole thing doesn't make much sense but its fun and entertaining nonetheless. Still, to the kind of audience `Van Helsing' was created for, it must seem like pretty tame stuff.Van Helsing is undoubtedly the first of many films trying to clone `Lord of the Rings' with its huge computer generated monsters and mass battle scenes. Like LOR, the special effects are amazing. But like LOR, the whole movie seems an exercise in special effects, as if that's all the audience came to see so that's what we will show them. There are perhaps a dozen action sequences in this picture, one right after the other, each one spectacular enough to have been the climax of a perfectly good action film. But because they are all so spectacular, their cumulative effect is to make each scene less amazing and less enjoyable. The lack of build up to them and the lack of character development to give them depth makes them less meaningful. It's like reading a comic book for two hours. When at the end, we realize how much Van Helsing has grown to love Anna, we wonder when he ever had time to do that between all the chases and battles with monsters.
Still, I like this picture better than Lord of the Rings because it doesn't take itself so seriously. LOR was like a Wagnerian Opera. This film comes off as pure adventure because the characters have a sense of adventure and a sense of humor, if a sardonic one. But I would have liked it a lot better if it concentrated on developing character and atmosphere and saved the fireworks for the end.In commenting on another action film I observed that the modern action film has become what the old fashioned Hollywood musical used to be. Whereas the musical used a slight plot to draw together the musical sequences, the modern action film does the same for action sequences. We used to see Fred and Ginger dance. Now we see stuntmen and CGI creations fight. But now it seems we have gone past even that to what amounts to a `clip show', virtually eliminating the plot, except for some shouted exposition, and giving us simply one breathless sequence after another. It all gets to be a little too much after a while. And there just isn't enough meat on the bones. Those few action sequences in North by Northwest meant more because the people in them mattered to us. Now, who cares?",Null,0,0,16 May 2004
Pearl Harbor," Thirty Seconds over Pearl Harbor and Tokyo
","To me, 'Pearl Harbor' is not a bowdlerization of the kind of WWI romance/action film that 'Thirty Seconds over Tokyo' represents but instead is an homage to it. Both films begin in the east and describe their heroes efforts to learn to fly and work as a team in the air while watching their relationships and personalities develop. The stories then move west until reaching the Pacific where the action really begins. The characters in both survived incredible adventures and then emotionally reunite at the end.  The situations are credible in both and the acting is fine and strong.There is a video-game quality to some of the action sequences in 'Pearl Harbor' but the human suffering is not ignored or trivialized. (The same could be said for 'Titanic', which is also a throwback to an earlier style of film-making that is much missed- I actually through 'Pearl Harbor' superior to 'Titanic', although I enjoyed both). Complaints that 'Pearl Harbor' and 'Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo' are historically inaccurate in some details or fail to tell the whole story of the war are pointless. All films sacrifice historical accuracy for story-telling to some extent and no film could tell the entire story of WWII. 'The Guns of Navarone' is hokum and it doesn't show the concentration camps but was it really necessary for it to do so? Of course not. And isn't it amusing to see one poster describe 'Pearl Harbor's' depiction of the Japanese as `racist' and another as `politically correct'. You can't please all the people all the time but all of these films pleased me.",Null,1,2,26 December 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, James Bond and Star Trek
","It used to be that the big action films and their sequels came out in the summer but that seems to be changing. Recently, the latest entries in four of the most famous film series of all time were released and I decided to see them all and perhaps compare them. The two older ones, James Bond and Star Trek, have shown their age in recent years, both of them often rehashing old plots and situations. The two newer ones, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, have caught the imagination of the public and have produced some of the most popular and admired movies of our time. To my surprise, I liked the old geezers better than the now more celebrated newcomers. I just found them more exciting and more entertaining. Isn't that what you pay a ticket for?I didn't care for the first Lord of the Rings, called 'The Fellowship of the Ring'. I was amazed by the special effects, which surpassed anything that I had seen before. The story, however seemed more like a protracted nightmare than an adventure. The heroes lacked any sense of esprit de corps. They looked more like the victims in a horror film, wondering if they were going to survive through the next scene. I just wanted it to end. Critics and friends said this one was better and I did like it more. There were more scenes that took place in the daylight. there was more humor, such as the Yogi Berraisms of the walking trees, ('You are small so you could be right'), and a fascinating character in Gollum, with his split personality paralleling the story of the ring, with the characters battling their darker natures. But it's still a three hour tour through a nightmare given by a cast of Lears. The battle scenes are spectacular, (the effects are even better than in the first film) and horrific. The army of Uruks with their Freddy Krueger faces and mounts that are described as wolves but snarl like grizzly bears are far more frightening than the Cylons of the Star Wars films but not much more effectual. Frodo Baggins has to be the least interesting epic hero of our times. I grew up with D'Artanian and Luke Skywalker. This is quite a comedown. Elijah Woods brings a worried look and little else to the role. Lord of the Rings has more meat on it's bones than other action films but it's not really entertaining in the truest sense.
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was much more enjoyable than the first Lord of tthe Rings. It has plenty of action and was full of British whimsy and humor. The child-heroes had real charm. I looked forward to the new one, 'The Chamber of Secrets'. I liked it, too but not quite as much. The whimsy and wonder was more sublimated to fright-night horrors and an ending that seemed more like something out of Lord of the Rings. Perhaps they are trying to compete? They even have a dwarf character who is somewhat the equivalent of Gollum but not very similar or as interesting. I think Harry should use his wits and his magic to save the day, not a sword.
The last James Bond film I saw was on a plane to Hawaii. It was called 'Tomorrow Never Dies' and gave me no desire to see another one. It was all chase scenes and violent students while a glum-looking Pierce Brosnan never seemed to ruffle his Arrow shirt. There was no discernible plot or characterization. the whole thing simply seemed like an ad for a video game. 'Die Another Day' proved to be a pleasant surprise. Bond is humanized by being captured and tortured for 14 months in a North Korean prison. He then is accused of spilling secrets by his own people, from whom he escapes and goes on a one man quest for revenge. As the movie goes on, this promising beginning evaporates and we go back to the video game absurdities, including Bond wind-surfing a seismic wave. But Halle Berry is worth a look and the film is never boring.Star Trek: Nemesis, while dismissed by critics, (as usual), proved to be the pick of the litter. It has as much action as the other series, (without overkill). It provides us with human characters we can really relate to and a story that is about something. In this case, it is about the very thing the film's critics complains it lacks: youth. The hero used to be a cocky, ambitious young officer wanting to make a name for himself. He's grown beyond that and now confronts a cloned version of himself with all the traits he used to possess, magnified by a childhood ordeal and now possessing great power. Captain Picard has to use what he knows about himself and what he has learned to win the day. He's helped by Data who effectively regresses to an earlier version of himself and will now have to retake the journey of experience and wisdom. There is more useful thought in this film than in the others combined and just as much excitement.
But now I feel a great desire to see something about real people living real lives with real problems. It would be a welcome change.",Null,0,0,24 December 2002
K-19: The Widowmaker," A battle without an enemy
","All submarine films start out with great potential as action dramas: the claustrophobia, the danger, the companionship and conflict between the crew members. They require an intelligent script and good acting but they generally get it, as they do here. The problem is one of variety. You have the looks through the periscope, the firing of the torpedoes, the explosions of the target ships, the depth charges, the waiting for enemy torpedoes to see if they are going to hit or miss...and what else? Well K-19 doesn't even have any of that. And yet it works. 	What it ultimately has is a drama about courage. The one thing it has in common with other famous submarine movies is a conflict between the captain and his second in command. This time it isn't Burt Lancaster and Clark Gable, (as in 'Run Silent, Run Deep'-1958), or Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman, (as in 'Crimson Tide'-1995) but rather Liam Neeson and Harrison Ford. the basic difference between them is that Neeson, the former captain of the ship who has been superseded by Ford for this mission, (as was Lancaster's character), looks at his crew as 'a family' with ultimate loyalty to each other. The captains job is to protect them from harm. Ford's concept is that, with the stakes that exist in a nuclear world, the captain has to be willing to push the crew to their limit and beyond, if necessary because the consequences effect not only them but the entire world. He is willing to sacrifice his crew, if necessary, to the greater good. Neeson is not. But Neeson knows how to gain their trust and loyalty and Ford does not. Eventually, both men have to learn from each other.	The test comes when the cooling system of the nuclear reactor breaks down and must be repaired by men who are willing to enter a chamber where the temperature is literally hot enough to boil their liquids and heavily radioactive to make repairs. They know they are going to die, although nobody admits it. Neeson here learns that, at least in the military service, men have to be sacrificed for the greater good. Ford learns to care about them. Neeson's conversion is not handled as well as Ford's, (far too abrupt, with no warning that he is even starting to think differently- I contrast that unfavorably with Lancaster in 'Run Silent Run Deep', where he learns the wisdom of what Gable was doing when he takes command). The ending reinforces both points of view. 	This is not a very pleasant movie to watch, with the normal tension and claustrophobia being supplemented by the horror of the burns sustained by the heroes who go into the reactor. But it's intelligent, creatively photographed, (with many 'comin' right atya' scenes) and splendidly acted, especially by Ford and Neeson, who's Russian accents are hardly convincing but whose performances certainly are. Ford's game face has never been fiercer. He has to be the grumpiest looking hero the movies have ever produced, although here he certainly has good reason. 	The film has the same basic premise as 'The Hunt for Red October'- a technologically advanced Russian submarine is sent to the Atlantic on it's first mission. But it's not a Tom Clancy thriller. It's something that really happened. It's far better than 'Crimson Tide' which had an unlikely premise, (I think the captain would on his own done exactly what the exec did and was overdone. This one is pure human drama.",Null,0,0,20 July 2002
Moulin Rouge!," You have to admire someone who is willing to use his imagination
","It's pretty rare these days. And the musical is a genre most deserving of a comeback. Not everything in this movie is going to please everybody but you need to give it a chance to work. It's a bit maudlin and the ending goes on too long but full of as much spirit as the last ten movies you've seen. I wouldn't give it any of the major Oscars, (although Luhrmann certainly deserves a nomination). But give it plenty of applause. And don't be too hard on people who are actually willing to try things.",Null,2,4,2 March 2002
The Illusionist," The original Illusionists
","I agree with those who have said that 'The Illusionist' and 'The Prestige' are not really comparable just because they are stories of magicians in the Victorian Era, (although I think 'The Prestige' must be Edwardian because Nikola Tesla didn't move to Colorado Springs until 1899). But you can learn about films by comparing them to similar films and the temptation to make the comparison is great. When I rent films, I usually rent two at time because I figure one of them is bound to be better than the other. I find it interesting to rent films that have some relation to each other: the original and the remake or the sequel; two films with the same actor or director or author; two top films from the same year, or two films in the same genre. These two were an ideal mix.They are both well made and have interesting stories. The big difference is that 'The Illusionist' is a romantic caper film and 'The Prestige' is a dark examination of rivalry and revenge. The characters in the first are more likable and the story more palatable. I enjoyed the film more. The acting is a mixed bag: Edward Norton gives a performance that is restrained to the point of being flat. Jessica Biel is adequate. Rufus Sewell is fine and Paul Giamatti again dominates a good picture, although someone should tell him that the old theatrical scene-stealing technique of whispering your lines went out with Oliver Reed. Christian Bale dominates every scene with Hugh Jackman. He just has more gravitas. Michael Caine is Michael Caine, which is fine. Scarlett Johansson is Scarlett Johanssen, which is OK.What's interesting is the reaction of some fans that magic tricks that are the result of trick photography or CGI somehow are disappointing. The cinema did not evolve from the theater or from novels. It evolved from magic. Its predecessor was the 'magic lantern show', which used some of the same concepts of projected images and the simulation of motion, was used first by magicians and not story-tellers. The works of Georges Méliès were those of a magician, not a novelist. If Eisenheim, Borden or Angier where here today, I think they'd all approve of the magic show these films represent. Then they'd probably become filmmakers themselves.",7,1,1,27 March 2007
Men in Black II," 94 minutes of good fun
","Those who didn't like this movie must have been expecting to see 'Schindler's List' or something similar. It's just good clean fun, fully as entertaining as the first movie with, if anything a tighter plot and more character development. The gags work just fine and the film is a wonderful excuse to spend 94 minutes in an air conditioned theater while escaping the global warming one of the film's characters has apparently caused. I think perhaps the main appeal of 'Men in Black', as well as the film to which it is most comparable, 'Ghostbusters', is that after years of watching the human race appear helpless before various mysterious forces, (as seen in the Mel Gibson movie that is previewed before MIBII starts), it's fun to see some guys with some answers and some attitude on our side. The human race ain't exactly chopped liver, you know!!!",Null,0,0,4 July 2002
Million Dollar Baby," Issues and SPOILERS
","I'm not sure why everyone is so worried about a spoiler for this picture. I've heard it compared to 'The Crying Game' and 'The Sixth Sense' in terms of the necessity of keeping a secret. Actually the sudden shift in this story is not that kind of shocker. It's just a dramatic turning point that would have the same effect even if someone knew it was going to happen. It's more like the knowledge that Hillary Swank was a woman playing a man in 'Boy's Don't Cry'. It's just part of the story. If it had happened earlier, everybody would be talking about it as that was what the movie was about.I bring it up here because I've read that the National Spinal Cord Injury Association has claimed that Clint Eastwood made this film as a 'vendetta against disabled people' in response to a 1997 lawsuit by a woman who sued him 8 years ago for the lack of handicapped access in a rest room of a building he owned. This is obviously ridiculous, as Eastwood didn't write this story and he doesn't make movies as vendetta against law suit claimants. It always distresses me when advocacy groups that have a legitimate cause invent controversies to call attention to themselves when there are real problems that need such light shed on them and innocent people get condemned by their actions.In this film the deterioration of Swank's paralyzed character seems accelerated for dramatic effect, (it took Chris Reeve nearly a decade to die of the same thing), and to justify Eastwood's actions. I find judging people in such circumstances difficult. It's like announcing what you would do if the last lifeboat on the Titanic had one seat left. You just don't know because you've not been in that situation. It certainly seems to me that wanting to continue under such circumstances is, in the end, a private decision, rather than a public one.I think a greater, unspoken issue with the film is the need to have a white protagonist in a sport dominated by blacks and Hispanics. Of course, the action we see could certainly have taken place but some of the scenes where Swank, as a sort of female Marciano, batters black and Hispanic rivals brought back ugly memories of sitting in a theater with a bunch of raucous white males rooting for Rocky to beat 'Clubber' Lang, something their real hero, Gerry Cooney, could not do to Larry Holmes, (in a closed circuit broadcast I attended shortly before that). It's not as blatant an attempt to pander to the larger white audience as that but it brought back those memories. Just as Rocky III was made 'OK' because Apollo Creed had befriended Rocky, the fact that Swank is white and most of these opponents, (and the cocky jerk in the gym), are black is supposed to be leavened by the presence of Morgan Freeman as the hero's and heroine's friend.Like other things in the movie, it's contrivance. All of the protagonists in this film are totally sympathetic. Various elements are injected into the story to make us feel for them. Eastwood's daughter doesn't like him for reasons which are not made clear. Swank's family seems to have arrived on a sight-seeing trip from 'Boys Don't Cry', (which, aside from Swank's amazing performance is probably the most singularly unpleasant film ever made). Freeman, for the umpteenth time since 'Glory', is the moral center of everyone's universe. They are agreeable people played by some of our finest actors but if this film were a fight, it would be considered 'fixed'.Still, it's well done for what it is. Several members of the audience in the theater I was in broke out crying, so it had its intended effect. Tear-jerkers, which is what this film becomes, are not my favorite genre. If they don't work, they seem appalling maudlin and silly. If they do, they take me places I don't necessarily want to go.My vote for the best film of the year goes to 'The Aviator'. The best fight film ever is still 'The Set Up'. And as for female boxing movies, I'll still take 'Girlfight', a much less pretentious film that is simply a character study of a troubled young girl who finds herself in the boxing ring.",Null,0,3,31 January 2005
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," When Things Were Black and White
","I've had the 'Edward R. Murrow' Collection from CBS for years and have enjoyed watching it's biography of Murrow, the complete Milo Radulovich, McCarthy and Annie Lee Moss shows many times. I'm sure George Clooney must have these as well as he used the actual footage extensively in his fine drama 'Good Night and Good Luck'. As a previous poster said, by concentrating on what was actually presented, Clooney is able to focus on the ethical issues that were the real substance of the broadcasts, rather than the tragicomic personalities involved. He wants us to see that the same issues are in our lives today, (Clooney has had his own battles with would-be modern McCarthys like Bill O'Reilly), but he isn't going to force the issue. He's doing exactly what Murrow and Friendly did with the McCarthy broadcast: using the actual record to tell the story.There are minor, but significant embellishments, mostly an impressive cast of actors who can tell us more with one look than an entire speech. Leading the way is David Straithairn as Murrow. Except for possessing a higher pitched voice than the original, he's got his man down cold. I would pick Frank Langella as William Paley, here presented as a man with ideals but who is rooted in the realities of business, the sort of guy who has to make the tough decisions the idealists like Murrow don't have to or want to deal with. Then there is Ray Wise as the vulnerable Don Hollenbeck, who was one of the co-creators of 'You Are There', a program this film somewhat resembles. He wound up being 'there' when he didn't really want to be.What really enhances the show is the black and white photography, (actually, according to the notes, it was 'The film was shot on color film on a grayscale set, then color-corrected in post'  whatever that means). Not only does it heighten the drama, (magazine photographers, in the days when they had a choice, said 'black and white for drama, color for excitement'), but the tremendous resolution seems to bring out each furrow and poor on each person's face, allowing the viewer to see into their souls.",9,88,109,13 November 2005
Singin' in the Rain," Why it's the best
","There are two kinds of musicals. You can call them different things. You could call them the Hollywood Musical and the Broadway Musical. That's not quite proper because the Hollywood Musical is what the Broadway Musical was in the 20's and 30's, before Rogers and Hammerstein changed everything. maybe a better distinction is the Dancing Musical vs. the Singing Musical, except that both kinds have dancing and singing...Let's try it this way. The original musicals on Broadway in the 20's and 30's and Hollywood in the 30's and 40's were musicals with a slight storyline, some singing and tremendous dancing numbers. They also have low comedy and plenty of beautiful girls. They usually are about show business itself and many of the numbers take place on the stage. the others seem like the likely result of bringing show people together: of course they are going to sing and dance from time to time. Looking at them these days, the singing is kind of boring, the comics dreadful and the plots the answer to a moron's prayer. It's the dance numbers that are timeless. These films were made for highlight reels like 'That's Entertainment'.Rogers and Hammerstein changed all that. They took serious plays and converted them into operetta of popular music. Characters who were not in show business at all used songs and dances as soliloquies to reveal their private thoughts. The result was some of the best plays and films of all time- Oklahoma, Carousel, The King and I, South Pacific, The Sound of Music, Brigadoon, Gigi, My Fair Lady, The Music Man, etc. South Pacific was the first film my parent sever took me to see and this is the type of musical I normally prefer. Here songs tended to dominate- 'Surrey with the Fringe on Top, 'Out of My Dreams', 'People Will Say We're in Love, 'If I Loved You', 'My Boy Bill', 'I Have Dreamed', 'Hello Young Lovers', 'Some Enchanted Evening', 'Younger Than Springtime', etc. ,etc. There are dance pieces but the dancers are on the sidelines.'Singing in the Rain' is the greatest of all the Hollywood Musicals. It has the memorable dances a Hollywood Musical needs: 'Make 'Em Laugh', Singing in the Rain', 'Good Morning', 'Broadway Melody'. There is also the best of the Freed-Brown songbook, such as 'You are My Lucky Star'. But it has the strongest story of any of the Hollywood Musicals, thanks to the Comden-Green team and the memories of the early days of sound. it's virtually the only Hollywood Musical that could have held up as a non-musical. It could have just been a comedy about he conversion to sound. it would not have been 'Singing in the Rain', but it would have been good.As it is, it's the one musical that has it all.",Null,13,18,18 April 2002
The Da Vinci Code," 50% of the people will agree with this review
","I say that because 50% of the people seem to agree with every review on the board. The film is that divisive and so the reviews are necessarily divided as well, along with people's reaction to them. I don't usually read novels but I read this one and I'm kind of sorry I did because it meant I knew everything that was going to happen ahead of time, just as with 'King Kong'. You wind up dissecting the film rather than experiencing it. If you are one of the few remaining cavemen who haven't read this book, I'd suggest seeing the movie first, then reading the book. It's easier to dissect a book and more fun to experience a movie.The big problem in both mediums for this material is the tremendous amount of exposition required to have some idea of what is going on. There is conversation after conversation giving a 'Cliff's Notes' version of history, at least the history Dan Brown decided to mix in with his dramatic speculations. The film at least cuts down on those to keep the action moving. It might have been a better idea to get all or most of that out of the way with Langdon's opening lecture, rather that jump-cutting to a book signing after his introduction. The filmmakers might have even had him dream about these events before he is awakened by the call from the police.Ron Howard is a more experienced storyteller than Dan Brown and the movie shows it. It's much more streamlined than the book and handles things like the attitude of Teabing's butler much better. Tom Hanks is adequate as Langdon, (emphasizing his claustrophobia at the beginning is a master-stroke as it seems to confirm Feche's suspicions). Audrey Tautou is OK as Sophie, although the character is not very well defined in either the book or the film. Ian McKellen plays Teabing not merely as the closest thing to a 'bad guy' in the story but something of a pathetically obsessed nut, also an improvement from the book.Although the history in the story ranges from speculative to simply wrong, (the film also cleverly deals with this: Langdon noting that the Priory of Scion is 'thought to be a hoax' but isn't), the basic idea of it: that it was intended that we be governed by traits both male and female, that our male dominated churches and governments have produced too much rivalry and violence and that we need more female nurturing, is a good one and well worth thinking about after seeing this film. But I'm still left with the basic question: If your group is opposed to the established church and possesses something that will 'destroy' it, (surely an overstatement), why would you keep it a secret for 2000 years? Wouldn't this make more sense if the Church held 'the Grail' and the Priory were trying to obtain it?",7,0,1,10 June 2006
Mystic River," Not mystic. Just the unvarnished truth.
","There is nothing I like better than a cast of excellent actors being given a series of strong roles in a good drama like this one. I find that much more impressive than line after line of computer generated soldiers doing battle, (if you know what I mean). This film was like a breath of fresh air to me, focusing on real, multi-dimensional people played by talented actors who know what they are doing. That's rare in the cinema these days.
Sean Penn is garnering most of the allocades and he is wonderful, his transformation into the DeNiro of his generation being now complete. The pain of a man haunted by the past and what he has become is evident in not only every scene but every look and gesture. This was the guy who played Spiccolli? But the best performance in the film is by Tim Robbins, as a middle-aged wreck of man whose life ended because of a childhood ordeal and who has been just wandering through life since. His hollowed-out eyes, the combination of defiance and resignation he has at the end is something very memorable.  The supporting cast lives up to their high standards. Laura Linney, with her `Lady McBeth' scene, (which should have come earlier in the film), Marcia Gay Harden as the wife who can't believe what her husband has done, Kevin Bacon as the cop who has to investigate his old friends and Laurence Fishburne as his partner who wants to make sure Bacon doesn't stray from his professional duties are all first-rate. Clint Eastwood's direction is evocative and lucid. The film, at 137 minutes, never drags and his juxtaposition of Penn's confrontation with Robbins and the similar confrontation between the kids is masterful. The atmosphere of the film is superb. Eastwood used to be thought of as the next generation's John Wayne. Can you imagine John Wayne doing `Mystic River'? And did you notice that he composed the score?Still, there are flaws, (POSSIBLE SPOIILERS)-	Why, oh why, doesn't the film end with Penn saying that they all got in that car? Surely Bacon would have taken him in at that point. What's with the parade at the end?-	The boyhood tragedy isn't really that strongly tied to the events of the present. Penn makes a speech that he wouldn't have become the guy he became without it. I wonder about that. -	As I mentioned, Linney's speech would have meant a lot more if it came earlier in the film, expressing support for Penn's actions before they found out they were wrong. By the time it happens, even Penn knows he's just created another tragedy. -	The Cross- it appears on the ring. It appears on Penn's back. What does it mean in the context of this story? Would Penn have gotten such an obvious symbol of his hidden pain etched into his body? Of course, he may not know that one of the abductors wore such a ring. But if that's true, why the tattoo?-	We don't learn much about the real perpetrators and their crime does not, in fact evolve from any of the personal dramas the movie concentrates on.
By the way, if you're like me, you like to rent more than one movie at a time, often with the selections having some relationship to each other. If you rent this one, look also for a film from two years ago called `In the Bedroom'. It contains many of the same elements, (although the neighborhood is certainly different).  The murder of a beloved child. Revenge by a character you can identify with if not really admire. The New England setting. Excellent acting and direction. Nothing is computer generated. Just people and their unvarnished truths.",Null,0,0,8 February 2004
A Beautiful Mind," Beautiful but Flawed
","The acting in this film is superb. Russell Crowe may get his second consecutive Oscar, (although I wouldn't mind it if they gave it to Tom Wilkinson, either). His run of performances in LA Confidential, The Insider, Gladiator and this is amazing. One of the best actors of our time. God was in a good mood when he made Jennifer Connelly and he included both intelligence and talent in the package. Even better is the directing of Ron Howard, one of those long-time Hollywood craftsman who may finally get his due this year, (he should have gotten it for Apollo 13 but the academy loves actors who direct their own films). What's especially great is that Howard let us see this story from the heros perspective. We figure things out when he does. What seems real to him seem just as real to us.The one flaw is the depiction of schizophrenia. I surfed the web on this subject when I got home and the malady is far more complex than this movie suggests and the solution is no where near as simple, (really, there is none). Similarly, autism is much more complex than in Rainman and split personality is much more complex than in The Three Faces of Eve, etc. A movie is just not an adequate forum to explore all the aspects of mental illness. But that doesn't mean you can't make a good movie about a character who suffers from one and all three of these are certainly good movies.",Null,0,2,2 March 2002
Glory Road," Historical Accuracy in Movies
","Whenever a film comes out based on real events these days, it comes under intense scrutiny from people who demand 100% historical accuracy. If the film comes up short, these historical critics are all over it, pointing out every discrepancy. 'Glory Road' tells us that Don Haskins took over a Texas Western team that had never recruited blacks before, brought in a bus load of them and won the national championship in his first year. In fact they won the national title in his fifth year and the school had used blacks before he ever showed up. In 'A Beautiful Mind', we see a massive oversimplification of schizophrenia: you just have to sort out who is real and who isn't. One of the people who isn't is Jennifer Connelly, who is playing a composite character. In 'Cinderella Man' Max Baer is presented as a sort of Clubber Lang, (Mr. T in Rocky III), character who is easy to hate when in real life he seems to have been a nice guy who's greatest fault is that he never took himself or his profession seriously enough.The amateur historians like to point these things out by way of expressing their moral superiority over the filmmakers and those who liked their film. But a life is not a movie. It's a kaleidoscoping stream of stories in which the person is sometimes the star and sometimes a bit player. The stories all have middles but don't always have a beginning or an end. To make a movie of a life or from a life, the filmmaker is going to have to edit that life. He's going to have to use devices like telescoping time or creating composite characters. That doesn't make him or those who enjoy his film inferior to people who like to look things up.At one time, storytelling was the major means of entertainment in this country. There were no movies or TV shows or records or computers. People entertained themselves by telling each other stories. To some extent this was a way of spreading 'news' but the entertainment value of the story was paramount. Accuracy was not required, especially if it was boring. This carried over into popular entertainment in the 20th century. People didn't care if 'My Darling Clementine' or 'Gunfight at the OK Corral' were historically accurate depictions of the confrontation that was key to their story, (and they sure weren't). 'Wyatt Earp' and 'Tombstone' were more accurate but they weren't necessarily better movies. But in the information age, people know more history than they ever did before and they want to see the historical benchmarks they are looking for and nothing that doesn't look right.So what standards should we apply? I'd say there are five levels of 'reality' or the lack of it: (1) Things we know happened. There is no historical debate about it. (2) Things that could have happened. This could include entirely fictional situations involving entirely fictional characters set in a realistic historical setting which don't contradict any known facts. (3) Things that may have happened. There may be some historical debate about them but it's not been resolved. (4) Things that probably didn't happen. It hasn't been proved that they didn't happen but there is considerable doubt about it. (5) Things that clearly didn't happen. They have been proved to be apocryphal or clearly contradict known facts. I would say that if the filmmaker stays within the first three categories, he needn't be criticized. The amateur historians will nail him by choosing different interpretations of #3 and asserting that the filmmaker is 'wrong'. But if he has a compelling dramatic reason for his interpretation, he's fine. If he ventures into #4 he'd better have really good dramatic reasons for doing so. He should avoid #5 if at all possible. He should also avoid libeling people and not announce that his film is the 'truth' and that everything else they've heard is a 'lie', (Hear that, Oliver Stone?) In 'Glory Road', I see no reason why the story had to have been depicted as taking place in a single year. The fact that TW had used black players before could be noted. It was the shear number of them that was unprecedented. The true attitudes of Adolph Rupp clearly fall under #3. He's treated much better than Max Baer was.In the end is to see the forest for the trees. Don't sweat the details so much you forget to enjoy a good movie, which 'Glory Road' is.",8,2,13,25 January 2006
Joker," Not sure what to make of it
","I went to see 'Joker' today. I'm normally not into comic book movies but the trailer intrigued me. They didn't tell you that this is about the Joker until we see the make-up and the word 'Gotham' towards the end. I thought it was the story of a good hearted guy who gets treated badly and loses the battle to believe in life and the human race, (which it turns out to be), and then I realized it's a 'Joker' origin story. I decided to see it when it came out. That decision was enforced when I heard of the praise Joachim Phoenix was getting for playing the lead role.Well now I've seen it and I fully agree that Phoenix's performance is a memorable one, fully on a par with the famed Heath Ledger portrayal in 'The Dark Knight' (2008). It's a showy role but he also catches some subtleties in the twisted character's manor and thinking. He'll probably win the Oscar for best actor. (Ledger posthumously won for supporting actor). It also struck me how much Phoenix looks like Laurence Oliver who might have played this role in another generation. There are a lot of references to other films in this one and one wonders whether Phoenix and the director might have had a Richard III look in mind, (a disheveled Richard III).I'm still trying to figure out my reaction to the movie itself. It's the story of a villain and we are obviously supposed to identify with that character and to have sympathy for him. I had to wonder how a potential real-life villain would respond to it. Would he see it as a justification for violence? The issue of the attention mass shooters get seemed relevant. Should we show any sympathy for this type of character? I was disappointed that 'Arthur Fleck', (the Joker's real name), wasn't a Chaplinesque character at the beginning: a simply soul who just wanted to make people laugh. He's already pretty screwed up to begin with. (There are scenes from Chaplin's 'Modern Times' in the film.) it's made clear that society's cruelty and apathy toward people is the real villain of the piece. Bruce Wayne's father seems to have a Trumpian attitude toward society and the poor. Robert De Niro plays a talk show host who seems sympathetic in a fantasy sequence that seems to be from Scorcese's 'King of Comedy' but is later revealed to have a Letterman-style cruelty in mocking people, including Arthur. This brings up the issue of perspective: What's comedy and what's tragedy? What's right and what's wrong? A thought that kept recurring is that our mass shooters and serial killers, if they seem to have a political point of view at all, seem to be right wingers with a grudge against put-upon minorities. This film suggests that individual violence is a rebellion by the put-upon against the rich and powerful. Of course it's logical that violent incidents will be more common as people's needs are not met and they feel more repressed and mistreated. But our problems these days seem to be more about people responding to right wing propaganda and scapegoating.The film is relentlessly downbeat and very far from funny. The only 'action is abrupt, bloody violence and rioting. There really isn't a good guy in the film. It's not fun to watch and decidedly not appropriate for children. But it is a strong character study and great performance. What impact it will have on society, I can't say.A few things to look for: the license plate on the police car at the end reads 'Industry First'. What does that mean: police are on the side of American corporations? There are several obvious references to 'Taxi Driver', including the presence of De Niro in this film. (Martin Scorcese was asked to direct this but was involved in his current film 'the Irishman'.) In the background during the final riot we see movie marquees for 'Ace in the Hole', the 1951 Kirk Douglas movies about a exploitive newspaper reporter who turns the story of a guy trapped in an old mine into a national story while preventing his rescue to keep the story going. That film was renamed 'The Big Carnival' by the studio to make it seem like a more 'fun' picture. And 'Carnival' is the name Arthur gives his clown character at the beginning of this film. Another marquee has two titles: 'Blow-Out' and 'Zorro the Gay Blade'. Those titles appear to have been chosen just because they were 1981 films and that when the action of this film is supposed to be taking place.",7,3,7,24 October 2019
Bruce Almighty," Not so mighty
","This film has excited some controversy from devout Christians because of it's rather whimsical view of God. I'm not religious by nature but it occurred to me in watching this film that a true believer would have little use for it. Why would God 'go on vacation' and leave his powers to a self-centered loser like Jim Carrey's character? Maybe he had in mind a lesson for Jim but what about the effects on everyone else, which includes a tidal wave that kills people? To a believer, God is more than the product of a screen writer's imagination but that's all we see here.	The film also commits another type of sacrilege by showing a clip from 'It's a Wonderful Life', hopefully suggesting that this film is a modern version of that one. Actually in tone and substance it more resembles Mel Gibson's film 'What Women Want', although even that film is better than this one. After all the 'hey, look what I can do' gross-out humor, (such as a monkey who makes a home in a thug's rear end), the sentimentality that dominates the end of the film comes out as phony and superficial.	The same is true for Carrey himself who continues to play his roles as if he were a split personality, Jimmy Stewart meets Jerry Lewis. Somehow the combination reduces both of them. In 'The Majestic', it was mostly Stewart in another derivative film, ('The Return of Martin Guerre' meets 'Cinema Paradisio' meets 'Guilty by Suspicion' with the Sullivan Ballou letter form Ken Burns 'The Civil War' thrown in). In this one it's more Lewis. Carrey has to find the right combination- or find his own persona- now that the teenyboppers who improbably made 'Ace Ventura' a hit have grown up.	Meanwhile, like moths to a flame, other performers are attracted to a Carrey film for the exposure what they presume will be a guaranteed hit will give them. Morgan Freeman plays God as a janitor, (maybe the one bit of true cleverness in the film: he's always asked to clean up other people's messes). Jennifer Anniston is the girlfriend who is both hopelessly smitten by Carrey yet disgusted by his self-absorption. Catherine Bell of JAG plays a sexy newscaster who tries to seduce Carrey at a party. Whether they got what they wanted from appearing in this film remains to be seen. This member of the audience sure didn't.",Null,2,4,1 June 2003
Ben-Hur," Biblical Epics
","I just got my first DVD player after holding out for year and have become a total convert. I am watching some of the old classics of my youth, both to see them again in mint condition and to have a look at all the special features, including the documentaries and commentaries. Presently I'm doing a festival of the great biblical epics of the 50's and 60's. My local video store had THE ROBE, (1953), BEN-HUR (1959), CLEOPATRA, (1963) and THE GREATST STORY EVER TOLD, (1965-let's call it TGSET). I thought I'd write a joint review comparing them.THE ROBE was done at the tail end of the old Hollywood, a studio production whereas these others were all filmed primarily on location with the international casts and crews we often saw making movies in the later era. But THE ROBE has all the Hollywood know-how we've come to expect. Particularly important was the pacing. It's a history lesson and a reverent film but it's also an entertainment. Young Richard Burton, (he was about 28) shows the impressive voice and passionate style that made him a name actor in the next decade, (he was nominated for an Oscar). Jean Simmons is very good and the smaller parts are well cast, particularly Richard Boone as Pontius Pilate, who in one scene leaves much more of an impression than Frank Thring or Telly Savalas, who do the same role in BEN-HUR and TGSET, respectively.But BEN-HUR is clearly the pick of the litter. This is true epic, full of glorious action scenes including the justly famous chariot race. But, as directed by William Wyler, it's also a very thoughtful film. Charlton Heston is excellent as the passionate and idealistic hero. Stephen Boyd is my all-time favorite movie villain. He's the one who should have won the supporting actor Oscar, not Hugh Griffith for his Arab businessman. But it's Wyler who carries the day. Noted primarily as a director of actors, (and especially actresses), he was by this stage in his carrier looking for challenges. He'd never directed an epic before. By bringing to the mix his sense for dialog and characterization, he gives this a depth you can't find in something directed by DeMille, for example, who was more a director of pageants than movies. Wyler's use of water as constant symbolism for cleaning the body and spirit is brilliant and memorable.Joseph Mankiewicz was also known for making more intimate films than CLEOPATRA, (which is not quite biblical but close enough). Like Wyler, he brings to the project something a normal director of epics would not have and CLEOPATRA is a much more intimate film than I remembered. Sure there is the absurdly overdone entrance into Rome and the Battle of Actium. But most of the scenes take place indoors and look like a filmed record of a stage play. Both Burton and Rex Harrison are excellent in their roles and Liz Taylor is fine, (and fine looking), as well, although I agree with suggestions that Sophia Loren would have been a better choice being more obviously Mediterranean. Like Martin Landau and others interviewed, I would like to see some effort to restore, as best as possible, the two missing hours of this film and its presentation in the two parts Mankiewicz intended, perhaps on one of the movie channels. Even in its present form, the film is better than I remembered.TGSET may be the greatest story every told but this is surely not the greatest telling of it. The film is long, s..l..o..w and mournful. It's like sitting through a three hour wake. The only scenes where anybody shows any joy are the resurrection scenes of Lazarus and Christ at the end. One scene is accompanied by the disciples singing the same mournful hymn over and over again. I don't think I would want to hang out with these guys for very long. The scenes in THE ROBE where Burton talks to the people who were touched by their relationship with Jesus and in BEN-HUR where he offers the hero water and where he is given it in return, are much more moving that Max Von Sydow's grim sermons in TGSET. We never see the results of living the way he suggests. And the miracle of resurrection seems an almost pointless substitute. If Jesus's soul has gone to join his father in Heaven, what difference does it make that his grave no longer holds his physical body?TGSET is filmed not in the Holy Land but in the deserts of Arizona and Utah, (Christ's visit to Utah must have pleased the Mormons.) The place looks totally desolate, such that no one would ever want to live there. Indeed, the area was flooded by a damn project shortly after film was completed. Too bad they weren't doing NOAH'S ARK or the TEN COMMANDMENTS. The actors are totally dwarfed by the surrounding scenery. It makes them and their story look temporary, not everlasting. The eclectic cast with its all-star cameos was considered something of a joke in it's time. At the Last Supper, TV Land viewers can see Illya Kuryakin, Baretta and Klinger! And it's fun to see Ingmar Bergman's knight from 'THE SEVENTH SEAL doing scenes with Ed Wynn, Vaudeville's 'Perfect Fool'. George Stevens is quoted as saying that someday, people viewing this film will not know who the actors were and will just see the characters. He's right. They all blend in together today. The performances are all very good, except for John Wayne's gargling of 'Truly, this man was the Son of God', which, as I recall, produced audible laughter in the theater in 1965 and still seems wildly inappropriate today. I remember feeling that Charlton Heston walked away with the film as John the Baptist and he still does four decades later. The acting isn't the problem with the film. It's the pace and the setting.",Null,0,2,1 November 2003
Rear Window," A World of Its Own
","It was Fred Astaire who discovered that you have to photograph dancers with a static camera because dancers move and a moving camera reduces movement. Most of Alfred Hitchcock's films, (although not all: see ROPE) are like a game of billiards. The characters are like billiard balls moving all over the table and colliding with each other until they all meet at the finale. But here the camera is static and it is the world that moves. What comes out is not simply the story, but all the details- all the stories. The result is a moment in time- a few days in the courtyard of a New York City apartment building in the sweaty summer of 1954- captured forever and most vividly. How many details and how many human stories do you see in FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, SABUTEUR, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH or NORTH BY NORTHWEST? Just the one. When you watch those films you are in an audience in a theater, watching a story played out on the screen. Here you see it all. You are in the movie. Remembering REAR WINDOW is like remembering something that you witnessed yourself- something that actually happened to you, not just a movie you watched. The result is not just Hitchcock's greatest film but one of the greatest films ever made.The marvelous detail of this film is just amazing. Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly are legends of the cinema and Thelma Ritter, Wendell Corey and Raymond Burr are actor's actors. But the real star is the set, a world unto itself. And the photography of that set, all that was needed to allow us to see into the rooms clearly- it's amazing stuff, (the lighting needed was so hot it set off the sprinkler system). But even better than that is the sound. It's not all just flat on the soundtrack, like actors in a dubbing session. Like good radio drama, it recognizes that people who are some distance away sound different. The voices coming from across the courtyard are just perfectly done and do more than even the camerawork to 'put you there'.The musical score for this film is not a film score at all- it's the music of these people, also heard across the courtyard. We hear the composer composing his song. We don't hear him doing it in five minutes, as we have heard in all the musicals. Instead it evolves over time. The dramatic piano cords he plays underscore the drama to come. We also hear some opera music that does the same. Everyone seems to have their own music-everyone except Thorwald, the murderer. And what a brilliant touch it is to make the murder a pathetic man, instead of some brilliant mastermind. In the end, he is one of us, as well, in a twisted way.I can't think of another movie that creates a world so vivid for the audience to live in. ROPE was strictly about the action in the apartment. The view out the window is just a painted backdrop. Maybe a better comparison could me made to DEAD END, but as good as that film it's not really the same. Our perspective changes too much. Perhaps my favorite scene in REAR WINDOW is the one moment, (seconds, really), the perspective does change. It's when Jeffries is struggling with Thorwald and everyone in the apartment house looks in the direction of his apartment for a change. Now there's a twist!",10,4,6,10 February 2019

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Our Long National Nightmare is Over
","When I reviewed `The Two Towers' a year ago I came up with what I thought was a good line: It's `a three hour tour of a nightmare conducted by a cast of Lears'. I now think perhaps the best reference is to Wagner. You half expect Brunehilda to march on the screen singing `Ride of the Valkries' at any moment. I found I can only take so much of churning battle scenes and the endless climb up mile high mountains and towers before I start looking at my watch. This film not only has that but an extra half hour of crownings, weddings and tearful goodbyes. And where the heck are they sailing at the end?The film is, as with its processors, primarily a technical achievement. The special effects in this series exceed that of anything I have ever seen. Any other movie looks like it was made a century ago by comparison. What is lacking is any real sense of adventure or leavening humor. This is the most grim-faced cast of heroes any movie ever had. It badly needs an iconoclastic character like Han Solo and scenes like the cantina scene from Star Wars to cut through all the overwrought dramatics. Instead we get still another battle and still another cliff. Even the effects seem less designed to tell the story than they are to show themselves off. They talk about one army being 6,000 strong and the other 10,000. That's as many people as are in sections of football stadiums. Here we see line after line of warriors stretching off to the horizon. At least Elijah Wood is given something to do besides look worried. All of the best scenes in this are with him, Sean Astin and Andy Serkis as Smeagol, `The Golem', who is by far my favorite character. They do battle with giant spiders, each other and themselves as they try to resist the lure of the ring. When they go off the screen so we can witness another computer generated battle, the film gets much less interesting.That said, I agree with a friend of mine who is much more of a fan of this that Peter Jackson and the film deserve to be recognized by the Academy for the extent of their achievement. I believe the films have to be evaluated as a trilogy or even as three parts of the same story and, given that there were no really great films out this year, (although several were good), I wouldn't mind if this won best picture and director Oscars. Certainly if they had released all three segments in the same year, it would have blown anything else away. The producers of the other contenders are insisting that they should only have to compete with `Return of the King' but I don't think they are going to get their wish.",Null,0,1,1 February 2004
Saboteur," Pure Hitch
","This is one of the classic Hitchcock films. It's not really a great film but its classic Hitchcock all the same. It's got the cross- country chase, the interesting characters and situation along the way, the innocent hero and the blonde, the oily villain and his crazed henchman, the big ending, (North by Northeast?). I think it's a little weak that every nice person- save for the girl, instinctively knows Bob Cummings is innocent the moment they meet him. If you ran into a guy who is accused of torching a defense plant and his best friend with it, who you immediately decide that he's not so bad? Also the horrendous nature of the accusation would make the `It Happened One Night' type scenes that draw the hero and heroine together rather unlikely. The wartime patriotic speech at the end can certainly be forgiven. What movies in 1942 didn't have a speech like that?The big thing, of course is the ending. Sweet old Norman Lloyd in his younger days finds, as Ben Hecht said, that `he needs a new tailor.' It's a model for many similar scenes later. One wonders why there was no denouement. Lloyd tells Cummings that he will clear him and then dies. Is Cummings on his way to jail at the end? An earlier scene suggests that the police already on his side. Wouldn't it be better to make that unclear and then have a scene afterwards where we find out he's off the hook?",Null,19,26,19 November 2003
Windtalkers," My Dad was a Marine officer who worked with the code talkers
","Possible mild SPOILERS- you really can't talk about this movie without revealing some of the action because it's the sort of movie people have to know something about to decide whether to see it) 	My family has been looking forward to this film for some time because my Dad was a Captain in the Marines at the time and spent some time with the Navajo code-talker operation. He has a wonderful documentary that was put out a few years ago on the subject and this dramatic presentation naturally peaked our interest. But my parents wanted me to see it first because Mom hates violence and Dad has some trouble seeing, which makes it hard to follow some movies. Perhaps there are people out there with the same sensibilities who might like to know what I told them.	The film is an excellent drama with wonderful, Oscar-caliber acting. Nicholas Cage's forte is playing world weary types and he gets the role of his career here, (much better than in 'Leaving Las Vegas'). he's a guy who was never any good at anything until he became a soldier. Even that wouldn't have worked out except there was a war on and he found he was very good at killing people. But he's not so impressed at that, especially after his squad is wiped out-except for him in the opening battle. He winds up with a symbolic injury- an inner ear problem that effects his sense of balance. He hates war but isn't any good at anything else so he feels compelled to return to it. He doesn't fight out of patriotism or beliefs because he doesn't have any. Maybe he never did.    	Adam Beach is just the opposite, a real 'Sunny Jim' type with a family, a religion and a country he believes in. Page starts out having utter contempt for him and doesn't want to be his friend because he might have to kill him. As the film progresses, they move closer and closer to each other from decidedly different directions as Cage finds his humanity reawakened, (or awakened), as his admiration for Beach grows, while Beach has to find it in himself to hate someone enough to kill them. They wind up comrades in spirit as well as in arms and watching these two actors perform this gradual transformation is one of the best pieces of acting I have seen in a movie in a long time. 	But you have to be able to sit through the movie first. The plot has it's contrivances and turns from merely dramatic to almost absurdly melodramatic at the end. To John Woo's credit, he keeps the blood and gore to a bare minimum, considering all the death he depicts. You never know when a terrible fire fight is going to break out and when they do, an awful lot of people die in front of you. Probably a hundred people do 'the dance of death' while being riddled with bullets, (including one guy who pirouettes several times for some reason). A couple dozen guys go flying through the air after explosions, one of them landing without his foot. Improbably, a guy gets beheaded with a samurai sword in the middle of a modern battle. In the worst scene, a marine with a flame-thrower is offering some candy to a crying girl in what is supposed to be a 'secure' village. A battle breaks out, his tanks are ruptured and he gets incinerated right in front of the girl- and us. Even if you are used to action or horror movies, there's a certain  amount of battle fatigue that sets in here. 	I had to tell my mother she would not enjoy watching this film, even if she might be impressed with the acting. I told Dad that, due to his vision problems, there would be long stretches where there was nothing but noise and he would not know what was going on. There are also subtitles that would have to be read off to him. I suggested the documentary he had was a better way to remember the code takers. One of the weaknesses of the film is that there really isn't enough about the code talking program. it's already been thought of and is already underway when the film begins. There's a brief early classroom scene but the real story of the code is not told here. It's really just a plot device to set up the moral dilemma the Cage character faces. A dilemma, by the way, that is pure Hollywood, according to my Dad. The only people they were told to kill were the Japs.",Null,4,7,23 June 2002
The Birds," Why, indeed?
","Why indeed? That's what everyone wants to know. Why did the birds suddenly decide to attack these people? Is there some connection to the middling soap opera we see played out over the first hour of the film and their attacks, (maybe they don't like middling soap operas?). Is it because they are fed up with all the pollution and people shooting at them all the time?  Or is it just because they can?Maybe Hitchcock just wanted to make a scary movie. He might ask you to imagine yourself in the restaurant and suddenly a bloodied man staggers in and says `The birds are attacking and we don't know why!' Now picture yourself in the same restaurant and suddenly a bloodied man staggers in and says,'The birds are attacking and we know exactly why!' Which is scarier?Perhaps a better question is why Hitch spent so much time, (more than usual in his films and more than you'll see in any other horror film), exploring the characters and their relationships, delving into motivations, attractions and resentments. Why does it matter that Jessica Tandy misses her husband because he is so strong and is now so dependent on her son that she doesn't want to share him? Why do we have to know that Suzanne Pleshette's schoolteacher is in love with Mitch and sees Melanie, (Tippi Hedren) as a rival? Why is Melanie's escapade in Rome or her raising funds for orphans so important? Why should we care about this? Do the birds care about these things?I think it's hopeless to try to make some connection between the `plot' and the events in the story. Hitchcock loved to experiment with the cinema and there is little sentiment and only superficial romance in most of this films. This story never gets to the point of being sentimental or romantic anyway. The film is surely not about ecology. Nobody says anything about the birds being angry about the environment or anything else.I think Hitch just liked the idea of a movie starting out to be about one thing and then turning out to be about something else entirely. That's what he did with PSYCHO, which starts out to be a crime melodrama about Janet Leigh trying to get away with some illicit funds and very suddenly becomes the ultimate `slasher' flick about Anthony Perkins and his crazy mother. Here we see a romantic comedy turn gradually into a soap opera and then gradually into a monster movie, with the birds being the monsters. The major difference is the gradual nature of the transition. The attic scene is this film's equivalent of the shower scene in PSYCHO but it doesn't have the same impact because the attacks have already begun, (and Tippi survives). The gradual pace of change is obviously intended to produce a sense of dread, rather than surprise. Looking at Tippi Hedren's performance it's hard to see why she didn't become a major star. She's gorgeous, (much better looking than her daughter, ironically named Melanie, thanks to a softer jaw line), has a strong voice, an expressive face and shows real acting ability. She should have won some kind of award for her perseverance in the attic scene, which took four days with live birds to shoot. That she came out of this an animal lover is amazing.What does it all mean? It means you got your money's worth when you bought your ticket.",Null,1,1,10 September 2003
Cinderella Man," One False Note
","Ron Howard's homage to boxer James J. Braddock is a good movie, well made with fine performances and its heart definitely in the right place. Some might criticize it for being full of Rocky-like clichés but this was a real-life Rocky and the story is told in an economical fashion that avoids the cartoonish nature of the Rocky series and thus becomes more moving- with one exception.I'd read some boxing history in the past and I wondered if Max Baer, the fighter Braddock beats for the title, was really the nasty guy he's pictured as here. 'The Encyclopedia of World Boxing Champions' by Jack McCallum, describes Baer in this manner: 'Max was a man difficult to dislike. He possessed a lusty sense of humor, irresistible good nature and tremendous warmth for people. He chattered and charmed his way into the hearts of just about everybody.' Somehow I didn't get that impression when Russell Crowe, as Braddock, asks Craig Bierko, as Max, to stop making comments about how he is going to kill Braddock in the ring because it was upsetting his family and Baer responds by saying, 'Don't worry, I'll be there to comfort your widow.' The final fight also seems to be misrepresented. McCallum reports 'The Braddock fight was a dull, routine affair, a painful spectacle of an over-confident, silly kid losing to an aged, methodical club fighter.' Baer himself is quoted as saying 'I clowned away the title in 15 rounds.' What we see in the movie is an exciting Pier 6 brawl with the fighters getting angry at each other, pummeling each other, the tide constantly turning. Exciting stuff but not the way it really happened.Of course Baer was a dangerous man in the ring. He possessed perhaps the best right hand punch ever and Frankie Campbell and Ernie Schaaf lost their lives absorbing it, as the film points out, (although I don't understand the motivation for the selfish promoter to endlessly point this out to Braddock who has become his meal ticket with the 'Cinderella Man' story). But those tragedies are more of a comment on boxing than on Baer. The real difference between Baer and Braddock seems not to have been their regard for their fellow human beings but rather their attitude toward their profession and that difference is what won the fight.I think what happened here is that Ron Howard and the writer decided the audience would respond more to a 'Clubber Lang' type 'bad guy' than a clown who threw away his crown and to a 'Hollywood' title fight rather than the semi-farcical event the real thing was.",8,3,5,13 June 2005
The Soloist," More the cello than the violins
","It was a rainy day and a good day to go to a movie. I'm not a fan of the action 'franchises'. I prefer what I call 'people' movies- movies that are about human beings, their lives and relationships. I'm willing to check them out whether or not they got great reviews or won awards, (which they often do because they stand out so much against the video-game dreck). 'The Soloist' has gotten some very negative reviews from some sources but I decided to give it a shot. It turned out to be one of the best movies I've seen in years.The key to it is that it doesn't try to be sentimental. There is a cello but not much violin music and that seems symbolic of the approach: it tells the story and presents the characters without sentimentality or lectures. The film allows us to determine our own reaction to it. Robert Downey Jr. gives his best ever performance as Mr. Lopez, the reporter who starts out looking at Mr. Ayers as a way to fill a column but comes to realize he was exploiting him rather than trying to be his friend. He then realizes that to be his friend he has to accept him as he is rather than forcing him to someone else. Jamie Foxx, who is amazing in the way he loses himself in his roles, avoids overplaying his part or asking for sympathy. He just acted what he saw. Together they are the best movie acting tandem I've seen in a long time.The film is brilliantly made, with just a hint of what Mr. Ayers has gone through trying to sort out reality and imagination and his triumph over the tragedy by finding a way to keep playing his music even if he was unable to continue his formal career. The editing is wonderful, jumping back and forth between Ayers and Lopez's stories without ever being confusing.I couldn't help but compare this to 'A Beautiful Mind', which also deals with schizophrenia but is full of inaccuracies. That was a good film despite that but this is a much better one.",10,2,3,7 May 2009
