The Longest Yard," The Monk seemed more phycotic....
","I Watched this movie Couple Days Ago and to be honest it was'nt that good. To me it was overrated and overcast. The music however was greatly placed.Now i do give it a 4 to the fact that it was funny the acting was okay (considering they were wrestler's and Adam saddler)and music was top notch but the reason i ''only'' give it a 4 is that its extremely over-casted. the film just seemed to heavily rely on big name stars like rappers and wrestlers (bit bias but i don't think wrestlers can act)rather than any decent actors. And lets face facts Adam saddler as an American football player are you nuts, you have seen the size of this guy right. To be honest I thought a lot of things in this movie were done a lot better in mean machine like the racist attack in the library wasn't as effective as the one in the corridor in mean machine or the basket ball match wasn't as cool or funny as the boxing match on mean machine and last but not least the monk seemed more of a bad-ass phyco than that Carlie wrestler (who to me just seemed dopey not phycotic).summary: it's alright the first time but after the jokes are gone its quite sh*te so rent it but don't waste five quid on it i did and i regretted it since....the worst movie I've seen Chris rock (shame i think rock's funny and can act) in so 4/10and I'm generous at that",4,1,2,19 June 2007
Batman Begins," What batman should have bin
","This movie in my eyes is what batman was intended to be. it keeps the gritty sense that batman year one had and gives you the best Gordon ever represented on the big screen along with the best batman. the thing that makes this movie stand out is its attempt of making the movie more realistic, i say more because batman begins some times ignores the laws of physics but its forgivable. they've made the movie as realistic as they could without destroying the character. the villains also feel more feasible rather than the silly look of the 90's villains. batman seems actually scary (given that i thought bat man was pretty gritty and scary in the Tim Burton's series and Batman forever but batman and robin was unforgivable) screaming at his foes and implying stealth and fear rather than using the judo chop style fighting he used in the 90's.My summary is this is what batman was intended to be.",10,2,2,29 June 2008
