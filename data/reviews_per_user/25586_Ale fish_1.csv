Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," An insult to the intelligence of every self respecting movie-goer.
","Was that it?  After all the hype and fanfare what we get is a infantile story, dreadful dialogue and bits and pieces ripped off from the previous Star Wars movies! Oh, and the endless marketing opportunities of course, mustn't forget those. It saddens me that it seems to be enough just to chuck endless CGI at an audience and lots of them will just lap it up. Shame on you! Demand character, story, acting, hell maybe even an emotional response. My favourite character was Jar Jar Binks - at least you couldn't understand what he was saying!",3,0,1,16 October 1999
