Sucker Punch," Underrated
","I feel that this movie is underrated. Sure, the story is weird but I can watch this movie over and over again unlike other movies. This film has style over substance. This is a great popcorn flick. You want to watch a bad movie? Go watch the Transformers movie series. I would rather watch this movie instead of Transformers. This movie is just visual eye candy with a great soundtrack. Beautiful actresses with great action scenes. Story and Dialog is stupid, but come on, you are not watching this movie because of the award winning screenplay. It is what it is. Hot girls kicking ass. The visual imagery is top notch. The acting was okay but I was distracted by the hot girls. Good movie for artists.",7,3,6,25 August 2015
