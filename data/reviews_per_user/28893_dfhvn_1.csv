Vertigo," Not that good
","I've been wanting to watch this movie for a long time and because of the reviews, I was with high expectations about it. Unfortunately, the movie is way too slow. Some scenes in the beginning are very boring because of the poor dialogs. The acting didn't helped with that, in most of the scenes it seemed artificial. The soundtrack seems to be delayed in some scenes, killing the whole thriller. However, the plot is very interesting and the last 30 minutes makes this big waste of time into a worth it movie. The first 100 minutes I couldn't give more than a 4, but the ending is so well constructed with such a good soundtrack that I am giving it a 6 in general.",6,0,2,20 January 2016
