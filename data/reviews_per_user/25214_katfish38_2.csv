The Hangover," Over rated
","I questioned how good this would be since I first saw the trailer. I had my doubts, but everyone kept telling me how hysterical it was. Sure, I chuckled once or twice, but this was far from funny. Certainly nothing like Old School or Wedding Crashers (which is what everyone who 'raved' about the film compared it to). The funniest part of the entire film was when the credits rolled. I don't mean that as an insult. That part really was funny. Other than that, I felt most of the jokes were flat, cheap sight gags and very few witty lines.I'd wait for this one on rental. Even then , it's not that great. Should have listened to my gut after I first saw the trailer.",1,19,40,12 July 2009
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Zzzzzzzzzzzz...
","My summary accurately captures my sentiments for this film. I must admit that I was not a huge fan of the book either, but the movie felt rushed and off balance. I could've cared less if any of the characters lived or died. I found it very bland, boring and clich√©d. This might actually be one area where the case could be made that the movie should have been longer to better develop the characters and build the relationships between them and Narnia's inhabitants. Their interaction with Aslan was flat and emotionless. The only shining aspect of the film was the part of Lucy Pevensie, played by Georgie Henley. She was absolutely precious throughout the film.",2,2,5,19 December 2005
