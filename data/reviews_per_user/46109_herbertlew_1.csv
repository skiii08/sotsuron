Requiem for a Dream," They should make high school kids/seniors watch this movie
","The movie is about addictions, mainly drug addictions, and how 4 people spiral down into grief and despair due to the effects of these addictions. It is a powerful movie, superb acting by the 4 main characters, with lots of emotions thrown in.  The crazy camera angles / effects added immensely to the film.  I cringed, was shocked, felt sorry, etc. at several scenes. The movie does make you think and it was good there was NOT a happy ending. No sugar coating in this movie.  I think the film can also make an impact on high school kids on how drugs could shatter their lives, and the lives of friends and family.  The 'gang bang' scene was very disturbing.",Null,0,1,24 February 2002
