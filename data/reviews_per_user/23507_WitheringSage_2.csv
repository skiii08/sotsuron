The Ring," A Classic Horror Film
","This was one of the most tactful, good old fashioned horror films of my generation. I don't scare easily, so it's hard for me to say this was scary, but I can say it was definitely very eerie and suspenseful. The plot was very well done and mysterious, it kind of leaves you wondering, but not in a 'the directors didn't cover it' kind of way. More of a 'it's supposed to be like that' kind of way. The acting was great, especially from David Dorfman who played Aidan, Rachel's son. He was an aloof, mysterious young boy whom, I think brought a lot of the eerieness onto the film. I definitely would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good jolt in the night.",Null,1,2,2 May 2004
Lost in Translation," There are no words...
","When I saw the preview for this movie I thought, 'Oh how boring.' But it received wild praise and won Oscars and what not, so I decided just to watch it for myself. Oh, boy. While the acting is well done, the plot left something to be desired. By the end of the movie I was left speechless. Not because it was so good, but not because it was really bad either. It was just a flatline, and while Bill Murray adds some much needed comedic relief, this movie just seemed to be lacking something for me. I understand the message, and once I watched it I finally understood the title of the film, but still...eh...this is just one of those movies where either you'll love it, or hate it. Watch for yourself.",Null,0,1,12 September 2004
