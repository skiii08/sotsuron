Antz," Anti-feminist nonsense
","This story makes no sense.  The story of the anthill has been completely perverted to suit the gender expectations of Hollywood generally, and in particular that of Pixar, a division of Lucasfilm.  It's not especially surprising that Lucasfilm has all these gender hang-ups, it's just really annoying. 	Antz is a very traditional story.  The princess realizes the error of her ways, is threatened by the bad guy, is saved by the hero, and plays a small role in saving her people.  But the movie isn't about her, it's about the underdog.  He is the one who has an idea, leads the adventure, uncovers the evil plot, leads the ants to victory and saves the day.  Oh yeah, and he gets the girl. 	In a real anthill, there are no heroes.  The collective is the hero. Individuals can't do anything.  The anthill is a poor metaphor for the power of free will.  It is the Queen who holds the power, such that it is, in an anthill.  There are no generals, no husbands.  The female leads the entire community.  The worker ants are female, the soldiers are usually female. The male ants are the small drones or princes, whose sole job is to mate with a princess, and fly away with her to start a new colony.  There is no way for a male to seize power; this is unheard of in the insect kingdom. 	Why was the anthill even chosen for this story?  Any truth about the anthill is immediately dispensed with.  The communistic tenets of the collective are discredited.  The power of the female is also tossed out the window.  The only remaining fact in this movie is that an ant can lift many times its own bodyweight.  Any kid that sees this film is going to get a very poor idea of what goes on in an anthill. 	So would I recommend this movie for kids?  No.  It's one long cliché, first of all.  It's also anti-feminist and the animation style is already dated, and not for the better.  There is serious product placement in the form of Pepsi products.  Basically, I couldn't find any redeeming qualities lurking in the shadows of this lame movie.  Skip it and rent Chicken Run.",1,5,25,6 January 2004
Chicken Run," Feminists rejoice!
","Chicken Run (2000) is a good film for kids.  A female figure, a hen named Ginger, is the heroine.  She organizes the hens in order to escape their prison.  The two male chickens are fibbers and not as helpful as they at first appear to be.  Ginger, however, manages to encourage them enough to make them useful.  The roosters do their part to help save the day, along with all the hens, but they don't take over the operation.  There are no princesses in this story, no helpless females awaiting a man's rescuing arms.  There is some romance, but it is egalitarian and modern.  No Victorian values here (George Lucas must hate this movie; in his version, the rooster would come in and single-handedly save the day).  This film boasts great stop-motion animation by Wallace and Gromit creator Nick Parks. It is extremely funny and might just teach kids not only compassion for animals, but also that women can save the day.  Loosely based on The Great Escape (1963), this film is not a mish-mash of clichés and poorly written dialogue.  It is clever enough to entertain kids and their parents or babysitters.",10,8,18,6 January 2004
Big Fish," sentimental bullhockey
","Tim Burton has made a number of films I really like (Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Pee Wee's Big Adventure), but this is not one of them.  The son trying to figure out his father is a wholly unlikable character.  If I were his dad, I'd disown him.  Like everyone else in the picture, he is successful, very clean cut, and middle class.  In fact, these words can be used to describe the film in its entirety, and I don't mean that as a compliment.  It's possible that the Burton films I like were carried by quirky actors like Johnny Depp and the young Winona Ryder.  As good as he was in Trainspotting, Ewan McGregor has become a dull, middle of the road, mediocre actor.  His role in the midst of these extended fantasy sequences is too bright-eyed, too naive to be at all involving or interesting.  The only reason I was able to sit through this entire picture was the presence of Steve Buscemi, in a relatively small role.How a film is able to involve a lot of carny sequences and remain pure as the driven snow is beyond me, but I think the more important question is WHY would a director do this?  Tim Burton's film has a very Disney-fied quality to it, everything is squeaky-clean sweetness and love once initial misunderstandings are overcome.  There is not nearly enough humor in this film to make it worthwhile.  Burton's wide-eyed fantasy world has become unbearably boring.",1,44,86,8 January 2004
