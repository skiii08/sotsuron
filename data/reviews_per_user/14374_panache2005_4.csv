3:10 to Yuma," Bold New Western
","This really was a great film that portrays Crowe's acting versatility perfectly. How many actors can you think of that can go from playing a British sea captain to a notorious Western outlaw? Not many. And to credit Christian Bale with the most incredible acting I think I've ever seen out of him. His face managed to capture a multitude of expressions at once, and he successfully acted as a desperate rancher and a hard-ass soldier, both at once.If you'd like to see a movie with superb acting, great sets, and wonderful screenplay, I strongly recommend 3:10 to Yuma. It made my day.",10,1,3,14 October 2007
Troy," Disappointed.
","When Troy first came out, I wasn't old enough to see, but really wanted to. As the movie came in and out theatres, I begged my parents to let me get it off PPV (no), or rent it (another no). Even after I came of age they wouldn't let me see it. One day, when they both left, I discovered my chance when it was playing on AMC. It started out okay. Brad Pitt was hot and quite built as warrior Achilles, but I didn't really feel he put a lot of effort into his character. He seemed bored throughout, and more intimidating in a hunky lifeguard way then in a dangerous soldier way. And I was so disappointed with the women they cast! Diane Kruger as Helen wore so much eye-liner, in some scenes her left eye looked drastically larger than her right (also, eye-liner wasn't supposed to have been invented yet). The love that Brad Pitt and the skeezy Priestess share is cheesy, and so unrealistic (who falls that passionately in love in two days?). Orlando Bloom gave a valiant effort as Paris, but I couldn't help but feel that his character came off a little spoiled and wussy. I suppose the only actor I felt fulfilled his role was Eric Bana, who played Paris's older brother. Despite the hot actors, the intense battle scenes and the amazing sets, I felt bored, because a) I knew what the outcome would be--who didn't? and b) the acting quality was more like rent-an-actor then lets-pay-millions-of-dollars-for-an actor.Skip it. See 'Spartacus' instead.",4,1,4,17 March 2008
Across the Universe," Hmmm...
","I went to see this movie with high expectations. All my friends said it was terrific. The songs were really amazingly sung (I got the soundtrack before seeing the movie). But after viewing it I was sorely disappointed. The only character that was focused on at all was Jude. Not even Lucy--his lover--had that much development, other than her past tragedy. I thought the transitions from dialogue to song were horrible, and totally random. Additionally, it was hard to take the entire movie seriously. I wanted to like it, but found I couldn't. It started out okay, but everything just got more confusing as the movie progressed.The acting was good. The script was mediocre. The execution left much to be desired, as did the plot.",4,5,10,19 February 2008
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Unimpressed
","Normally, Cate Blanchett leaves me thoroughly stunned with her amazing acting talent. Every movie she's played in I've enjoyed to watch. However, this was the exception. As Elizabeth, Blanchett tries unsuccessfully to portray a pensive, religious, and strong-willed woman. However, the I've-just-seen-something-I-strongly-disprove-of look she has throughout the film just didn't cut it for me. That, and the mysterious persona she conveys makes her look more like she's craving attention then trying to withstand from it. Also, all of the extra female characters looked the same, which got incredibly confusing. The men did, as well: each had brown eyes, brown hair, and brown stubble. I'll admit the costume design, for which the film won the Oscar, was thorough and beautiful...on the women. However, men strutting around in pantaloons made me laugh each and every time.Overall, I though Blanchett could've done way better. 3 out of 10.",3,6,7,26 February 2008
