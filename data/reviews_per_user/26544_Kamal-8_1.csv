The Blair Witch Project," Cheap
","This movie is not the best of horror movies. Sure, it has some pretty scary moments, and the story behind it is cool, but the actual film is very cheap. The effects are easily made, and all you hear is f***. I'd watch this film if it was on tv, or I could get it free, but otherwise I wouldn't waste the time.",Null,0,1,7 January 2001
