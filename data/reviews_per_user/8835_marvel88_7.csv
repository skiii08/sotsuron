Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," My Phantom Menace Story
","I'll begin this in May 1999. I was 6 years younger than I am now. My mother worked at a local hotel and I was there too. Next door was a Taco Bell. One day a family of three came in with Taco Bell for lunch, and the girl had a happy meal. Her toy was of some sort of alien that, when you pull its arms, a tongue came out. I wanted one too. So I went to Taco Bell, and got the toy called 'Jar Jar Binks.' I saw this toy was from 'Star Wars Episode I which was in theaters. I decided to see it. That's how Jar Jar Binks introduced me to Star Wars.The movie begins with Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, two Jedi who have come to talk to Viceroy Nute Gunray, who is planning to use his Trade Federation army to invade the planet Naboo. Well, the movie goes on, with Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan meeting with Queen Amidala of Naboo trying to stop the invasion. On Naboo they meet Jar Jar Binks, a Gungan. They are forced to land on Tatooine, where they meet a slave named Anakin Skywalker. Near the end, amazing battles occur along with in my opinion as the greatest battle of the Star Wars saga, with Darth Maul.Many Star Wars fans hate this movie, mainly because of Jar Jar Binks. I like this movie second next to Revenge of the Sith. Call me crazy, but its true. And I LIKE Jar Jar. I really enjoyed this movie, and it introduced me to all the Star Wars movies. By 2000, I was a Star Wars nerd. So, I thought it was great, and I really recommend it.",Null,1,2,6 June 2005
Nacho Libre," On the great side of the movies, Nachoooooooooo!!!!!!!!!
","Alright, now that I have your attention due to my cheesy title, let me give my review. I went to see Nacho Libre to to the comedic greatness of Jack Black, and I was not disappointed! At an orphanage in 1970s Oaxaca, Mexico, Ignacio (Black)is a cook who has a passion for the Lord and MeHEcan spices. But the children do not like his food, and Ignacio realizes he needs money for fresh ingredients to make perfect meals. And due to his interest in lucha libre, Mexican wrestling, he realizes its his perfect opportunity. But because of his crush Encarnacion's disapproval and the church's forbidding, he must keep it a secret to stay in the monestary. So he starts the wrestling alias Nacho Libre with tag-team partner Esqueleto, he must win the matches against the toughest luchadores in Oaxaca, maybe the world, to get the orphans their food.Its very good, with many new great catchlines, and great situations. The characters all have their own touch, which really helps. Any Black fan will LOVE it, as will any WWE fan who wants to see some damn good wrestling scenes.Overall, its a hilarious and perfect summer movie. I loved it, and can only hope for a sequel.",Null,0,0,16 June 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A Great Action Film (With Romance)
","The Phantom Menace got me hooked in 1999, so I was excited to see Episode II. I saw it at 8:00 PM the day it came out. With the sound system blaring, it was quite a film. Set 10 years after Episode I, Anakin is now a Padawan.After assassination attempts keep occurring on Senator Amidala, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker are called to protect her. Anakin is 10 years older, and has been thinking about Padme ever since he left for his Jedi training with Obi-Wan. New characters such as Jango Fett and Count Dooku are introduced, and a classic, Boba Fett, is shown as a 12 year old boy. We get to learn more about the 'Clone Wars' that Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker spoke of in the original 1977 Star Wars, 'A New Hope.' And, of course, the thing that got me the most excited, Yoda uses a lightsaber in battle.It is a good movie, with great action scenes and some of the most memorable Star Wars moments in the prequel and even the whole trilogy. But, there is a lot of romance between Anakin and Padme in the movie. That is one of the negatives. I thought that acting was good, and Hayden Christensen was a good choice for the role of Anakin Skywalker. Even though it is probably last on my list of Star Wars movies, I still think of it as one of my favorite movies. I just love all the Star Wars films.",Null,1,2,7 June 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Huh???????
","Well, I was forced to watch this by a friend trying to get me to like LOTR more than Star Wars. So I did. And I have to say I didn't get what was happening pretty much throughout the movie.The action was great, I just didn't understand the plot. I'm no LOTR basher, but it's not the movie for me. And I don't want to go up against the LOTR nerds, so I won't say anything negative. And since I'm not praising the movie, this review probably won't get noticed and is useless.Well, I don't get all the LOTR hype. If you'll excuse me, I'll go watch Return of the Jedi now.",Null,4,9,6 June 2005
The Da Vinci Code," The Da Vinci Code: Point-of-View of Someone Who Didn't Read The Book
","Well, all the hype sure is enough to make you see what the fuss is about: the Vatican threatening it, calling it 'anti-christian', people in India starving themselves in protests, countries banning it, and probably everyone's favorite: Tom Hanks' do.If you ask me, all the hype wasn't about a Satanist film; it was about a good movie. I haven't read the book, so most was new to me, and I thought it was great. I mainly went to see it to see my favorite actor in the leading role, and I got much more than that.Robert Langdon(Tom Hanks), a leading Harvard scholar, is suspected of murder, and Sophie Neveu(Audrey Tatou), tries to help him clear his name. But the process is actually much darker, a creepy albino monk named Silas(Paul Bettany) who painfully wraps and beats his body with chains as a sacrifice to Jesus Christ, is killing people after getting commands from a dark voice called, 'The Teacher.' In their adventures, Langdon and Tatou meet up with Sir Leigh Teabing(Ian McKellen) and the plot thickens as they discuss the fact that Jesus Christ may have been married, and had a child whose bloodline runs through today, with the Church covering it up. They go through adventures to escape Captain Fache(Jean Reno) in pursuit of accused killers Langdon and Neveu. They become increasingly close to finding the secret on who Christ's descendant is, and where his 'wife' Mary Magdelene is buried.I didn't go to question my faith, I went to see a good Tom Hanks movie; and that's what I got. I think it's a good movie to see during the weekends. I don't consider myself 'evil' for seeing it, because it didn't waver my faith, I view it as entirely fiction. So to see a movie with action and albinos (not a normal combination), go see 'The Da Vinci Code.'",Null,4,6,22 May 2006
It's a Wonderful Life," Makes You Glad To Be Alive
","The year was 1946 and soldiers were just returning to the states from the war. Among them was James Stewart, an actor who had delivered a knockout performance in 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,' and won an Oscar for 'The Philadelphia Story.' But after 5 years, Stewart planned to take a break because he thought he was rusty, and Lionel Barrymore convinced him to do this film. Thank God he did.This was the first older film that I watched back in December and now I have seen well over fifty classic films. This movie is amazing. As you watch the movie, you will begin to truly embrace Bailey. You feel for him in his highs and lows. Stewart gives the ultimate performance, he greatest of his career. Henry Travers and Barrymore are also phenomenal. Frank Capra created a true masterpiece here filled with emotion that will truly get to you. After you have watched this film, you will be glad you're alive, and don't be surprised if you're in tears as well.A true gem of cinema that you do not see often, filled with heart and emotion that is just as rare. I love watching the film at Christmastime, but there is no question in my mind that this movie can work magic any time of the year. So if you're feeling down, or just want to watch one of the greatest movies ever filmed, watch 'It's a Wonderful Life.' An easy 10/10, higher if possible.",Null,0,6,21 June 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The end of the saga- and what an ending it was.
","Well Star Wars fans, it's all come down to this. Ever since that day in May 1977, when fans first flocked to see this amazing movie, it's all been leading up to this. It is over, but at least we can say that it ended with flying colors.The movie begins with Anakin and Obi-Wan coming to rescue Chancellor Palpatine from General Grievous. Anakin meets up with Count Dooku, and they battle once and for all. Grievous is becoming a bigger threat to the Republic, so Obi-Wan travels to Utapau to defeat him. The Jedi Council suspects Palpatine of being up to something, so Anakin is sent to 'spy' on him. Meanwhile on Kashyyyk, Yoda travels to meet with Generals Tarfful and Chewbacca about the invasion coming on the planet. Anakin becomes closer with Palpatine, and in the end, it's Anakin's fear of death that turns him to the Dark Side. Mace Windu battles Sidious, and Anakin betrays Windu. In the end, Obi-Wan and Anakin must fight on Mustafar to settle it.I saw Revenge of the Sith the day it came out. I was excited to be seeing a new Star Wars movie, an event that gets any fan excited. The movie shows how Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker come to rescue Chancellor Palpatine, reshowing Count Dooku, and introducing General Grievous. Grievous is, in my opinion, one of the greatest villains of the saga, who is used way too little, and will never get the credit he truly deserves. The movie shows how Anakin forms a greater friendship with Palpatine, and where Padme and Anakin's relationship leads to. And we are introduced to one of the saga's most memorable scenes, the introduction to Darth Vader. And, to most fans approval, I only counted 3 times I saw Jar Jar Binks.The movie brings a very dark premises to the saga, even darker than The Empire Strikes Back or Attack of the Clones. Thinking back on some scenes, it gives me goosebumps. The battle scenes are fantastic, especially the Anakin-Obi-Wan duel. It explains many plot holes, and introduces characters from the original trilogy, like Chewbacca and Grand Moff Tarkin. I did wish characters like Han Solo, Jabba the Hutt, and Boba Fett were recognized, but maybe that will happen in the 2006 TV series. That is a how I will greatly anticipate now that the movies are over for good. This movie also has great promotion, like the contest and toys at Burger King, the M&Ms characters, the Skittles, Lays potato chips, the cereal boxes, Kudos bars, and the Pop Tarts.I was sad as I walked out of the theater, but then I felt that I had seen one of my favorite movies, and you get that great feeling you rarely get coming out of movies. And as the bigger summer blockbusters are approaching, we can expect that Star Wars may be pushed out of the box office, and then this will all truly be over. But in the end, I think all Star Wars fans can say, since 1977, George Lucas provided us with a feeling we all know and love, and, call me a nerd or not, I'll miss that feeling.Thank you George Lucas, and everybody involved in Star Wars for the last 28 years, for the greatest experiences of my life.",Null,2,6,18 June 2005
