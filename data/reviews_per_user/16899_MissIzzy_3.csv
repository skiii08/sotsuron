Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Looks Better in Retrospect
","When TPM first came out, people were none too impressed, because it had problems, which even Return of the Jedi didn't.  The latter started looking better.  Well, now the same thing has happened.  With the advent of AOTC, I, for one, am looking much more fondly on this much maligned Episode 1. Granted, qualitywise it's not much better a movie then AOTC.  But it's a lot more entertaining.  Probably because Jar Jar isn't nearly as annoying as Hayden Christensen(Sure Jake Lloyd wasn't much good either, but he didn't get as much opportunity to make people cringe as Hayden did, because of the way the part was written).  In fact, one gets the impression that Lucas hadn't entirely gone to seed quite yet when he did this one.  Sure, there are groans, but after watching AOTC, there don't seem so many of them as there once did. Which leaves the question of what will happen to AOTC after Episode III comes out.",7,2,4,8 October 2003
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Kloves needs to be replaced!
","So Columbus and Kloves were accused of being too faithful to the books for the first two movies.  Cuaron and Kloves won't be getting that accusation this time round.  Not having any respect for the book whatsoever, on the other hand... Or rather, for the characters.  Granted, this is something that can only anger book fans, but when Hermione Granger is suddenly a superwoman and Ron Weasley is suddenly a scaredy-cat, beyound, as far as I can tell, the needs of the change of medium, one starts to suspect laziness.  But most of this is their lines, i.e. Kloves. Cuaron actually does a pretty good with the directing.  But Kloves has thrown in some horrible dialogue(mostly to Dumbledore) that his direction doesn't keep the audience from going, 'Huh?'  Scenes are put into place poorly(most jarring example probably being The Three Broomsticks scene), the plot rushes at fever-pace without trying to figure itself out, one desperately needed explanation that could have easily been arranged to fill all of two minutes of running time does not manifest. Unfortunately, Kloves wrote Goblet of Fire too.  Please, please replace him before he butchers Order of the Pheonix!",Null,0,0,11 June 2004
Remember the Titans," Typical Disney:feel-good, containing a message, and inaccurate
","This really is a good movie, all in all.  It's a very good story, good characters, everyone puts in a good performance, and I for one was cheering and on the edge of my seat.  The message was even clear without being hampering, which isn't easy to do.  But don't think this is the actual story.  I happen to live in Alexandria, I happen to go to T.C. now, and I happen know it didn't happen like this at all.  But hey, true-story movies are never really accurate, so sit back and enjoy the story of a fictional town and school that happen to share names and statistics with a real one. Remember that the real T.C. building looks nothing like that *thing* they showed in the movie, but other then that, it really is wonderful to watch.",7,0,0,14 October 2000
