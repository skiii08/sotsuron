Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars: The Missing Ingredient
","A movie that couldn't fail to please me and did so anyway. Now I'm not your typical Phantom Menace hater. As a scifi and Star Wars nut and a big fan of McGregor, Neeson and Portman, I was really looking forward to this movie and willing to give it a heap of goodwill. But my goodwill ran out.Synopsis (SPOILERS)For rather unclear reasons the Trade Federation blockades a planet called Naboo and the furious Parliament sends two (well one and a half) Jedi's to convince them to stop. Failing before even starting, they escape with the Queen to a planet where they meet Anakin Skywalker. He seems gifted so the Jedi's take him with them whilst preparing to free Naboo. In a massive battle, they manage this, but by then we've learned that a Sith Lord was the puppet master of the Trade Federation. Erm that's about it.Before I delve into the long awaited dislike section let's look at the highlights.THINGS I LIKED1) I really liked the music2) Whilst at times completely underwhelming, I liked Neeson and McGregor as Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan3) Darth Maul is a fantastic villain, albeit one-dimensional, and the fight between him and the Jedi's is a nicely chaotic, violent dance. Kudos for those scenes that I would have thoroughly enjoyed had the screen not continuously switched to Anakin crashing into everything in his vicinity.4) There are many references to the old trilogy which pleases the senses5) Senator Palpatine is a wonderful addition to the universe, even though it's pretty clear what he will becomeTHINGS I DISLIKED1) The beginning. In A New Hope we learn of the Empire and the Rebels, we then see the Empire's finest chase the Rebel Princess, who sends vital information with two droids, which brings Luke into the story, which brings Obi-Wan into the story, and their need to escape gives us Han and Chewie. It's as smooth as gentile Zen stream. Here the Federation invades a planet and we meet the Jedi's and the Queen who escape to a planet that has Anakin, to which Qui- Gon is drawn like a Catholic Priest. Much like my girlfriend's happy days, there is no flow. We barely get any motivation for the Trade Federation to invade a planet we don't know, other than they are manipulated themselves. Even if the Queen hadn't escaped I do not see what difference it would make. I know it's a plan to disrupt the Senate but it's one small, unknown planet, that at this point holds no interest.2) Darth Maul (yes, yes, he's awesome and the Kendo Lightsaber Stick is cool) has no character development making him a mere puppet of his master3) Obi-Wan: I was so disappointed when he wasn't revealed but nonchalantly introduced. This is a big name in Star Wars played by a good actor, and it could have been an epic moment.4) The meeting between Anakin and Obi-Wan could also have been legendary. We know how badly things will get which glues us to the screen when they meet but it's basically 'So you're a Jedi too, har har, pleasure to meet you!'5) This movie desperately needed a Suicide Squad bar scene, where we see some believable, entertaining camaraderie developing between the main cast, much like the Luke, Leia and Han bickering evolved into trust and loyalty.6) The ending. It's bad enough that Anakin wins the day by mistake but I also do not really care for either the land people or the underwater people of Naboo and that they finally make an alliance is about as interesting as watching grass grow. The zoom in on Palpatine is not bad but we already know it's him doing evil deeds so it's unnecessary. 7) Yoda and Mace Windu seem interesting and we barely get any of it.8) Knowing where Anakin and Padme are going the age gap slightly bothers me.9) These complaints are worth noting because they are always repeated, and not without cause: making the Force biologically measurable, Jar Jar is annoying, Jake Lloyd can't act, everyone acts slightly wooden, the CGI takes precedence over the story, it tries too hard, the pod race goes on too long, it kills off it's best villain and good guy.10) But I would forgive it all were it not for the missing ingredient: Magic. The first trilogy captured kids and adults alike and created arguably the strongest and most dedicated fan base in history, and here, while looking slick and having some good moments, it just doesn't work. It doesn't compel. It's mildly interesting. There is little character development. Little story. Barely any depth. No heart. It lacks the roguish charm of its predecessors.CONCLUSIONIt's not as bad as it was described, say, 10 years ago but it cannot fill the shoes of the first movies -not even close. There are some good moments and it's still watchable, but a horrible character, unbearable kid acting (look at Mama, Sixth Sense or I am Sam to see the difference) and CGI obsessiveness give a story that should work a deservedly bad reputation. 5/10 mostly because of the music, the nods to the past, Neeson, Maul and Palpatine.",5,0,2,18 April 2017
Suicide Squad," The ingredients are good but the soup isn't
","Suicide Squad
I feel SS is a missed opportunity. The ingredients are there but somehow fail to make a good soup. At the heart of the problem is the ludicrous nature of the whole idea of SS. I a movie that establishes the existence of the Flash and Batman they answer the question 'what of the next Superman is evil' by arming a 100 pound mental patient with a baseball bat. The whole movie is further stopped in its tracks by Flag and Waller, 2 of the worst characters I have ever seen. Roid raging, meth addicted, over the top aggressive against people who can kill them in a nanosecond. They don't get the good kind of hatred one can get from a bad guy, but the 'Turn the TV off' hatred that no character should invoke as it defeats the purpose of the movie. There's totally wasted characters like Katana, introduced with one line of forced exposition and who spends most of her time menacingly unsheathing her weapon before inexplicably joining the SS based on nothing.
Halfway through the movie I cannot even begin to describe the anger I felt when I realized that half the movie is a rescue mission to save Waller (you know, the supposedly though woman whose complete inaptitude causes more problems than the main baddie of the movie). The main baddie, speaking of which, is played by a model who can't act, has a brother that is pointless, and uses fisticuffs instead of her wizard power to fight the SS, all set to an obnoxious soundtrack whilst the utterly unnecessary Joker is whining in the background of the 'plot'. To add insult to injury, when the SS somehow emerges victoriously Waller immediately gets in their faces trying to act tough, even though, I'll say it again, the whole Earth was risked on her utter uselessness in her job. Why does everyone bend over backwards to accommodate her? Just have Croc bite her head off and it would be a happy ending.
There are some good elements, like Margot Robbie and the use of colour, but you have Will Smith who plays Will Smith, a guy with a boomerang, and a crocodile man who is a racial stereotype. I had high hopes for this movie but you might as well watch the trailers and you'll get all the good stuff without suffering through this cinematic torture.",6,0,0,19 April 2020
Aliens," Perfectly blends horror, action and scifi
","Is this the perfect movie? Well, maybe not perfect. But it is a perfect blend of horror, scifi and action, excelling in all three genres and creating a legendary flick.SynopsisRipley is rescued by a salvage team after floating in space for 57 years. After being questioned by the corporation she settles into life. However, the world where the alien entered their ship is now colonized and all contact is lost. Grudgingly, Ripley goes along a group of marines as an adviser to check out the colony. After arriving, they find the place deserted. When they do find whatever is left of the colonists, they are attacked by aliens. One by one they die until Ripley dukes it out with the alien Queen, wins, and sets the survivors in cryosleep.Bad StuffErm.........maybe Newt forms a bond with Ripley a little too soon? Ripley forgives Biship out of nowhere? Why did the marines not check the ceiling of their last-stance place? Hudson can be a little annoying? Well, all of these are minor points. It's almost nitpicking. This movie has no real flaws of any magnitude. Good StuffThere's too much to mention, so I'll just say this: Aliens enriches Alien and the two should, if possible, be viewed in one session. Alien was a horror scifi, this adds action. All of the characters are interesting. It fixes the one bad point form the first movie, which is that Ripley really isn't that likable. But here we see another side to her, a softer side while remaining an ass-kicking heroine. All the marines are cool, but Vasquez makes an especially memorable impression. She's the kind of chick you want next to you when you go into battle. She's capable, ruthless, tough as nails, handy, and oddly sexy. I like Hudson, Drake, Apone and Hicks. Burke and Gorman are assholes but at least they have some depth, some palpable reality about them. The aliens look awesome as does the whole colony. Newt is very cute. A small detail this movie does great is showing us the bullet counter on various weapons, which greatly increases the feeling of hopelessness as the marines' arsenal becomes increasingly depleted. Just like Alien, there is a hot, swampy, suffocating feel to the movie that works best when seen after sunset with the lights out.Thunderin' Tim Tip: if possible, watch the Special Edition. If gives more meat to the story of the colonists and Newt. It's worth the 30 minutes of extra length. ConclusionA superb mix of three very separate movie styles creates a rightly legendary movie that has often been described as having no flaws. A smash hit in theaters, a favorite of critics, and an endearing piece of film making in the eyes of the masses, Aliens has withstood the test of time extremely well, and is Die Hard's only real rival for the title of Best Action Movie ever. Because the movie does not forget to incorporate the horror element (just the look of the slimy and slick aliens is enough to pull your feet of the floor and tuck them in your blanky) and the scifi, giving us more info on the inner workings of this fascinating species, the movie feels as a tight unit, compact, a near perfect product. I love this movie and almost everyone will agree. Superb. No real flaws. It's a solid 10/10.",10,4,7,20 September 2017
