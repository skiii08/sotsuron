Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," More Darth Maul, less Jar Jar
","A headline in USA Today read something like 'Phantom' Menaced by Galactic Expectations.'  Based on my experience, this was true. I've seen it twice now and I think the movie focuses too much on special effects and not enough on the story.  There are too many scenes that are simply too contrived in their efforts to showcase the special effects technology.  Also, I think that the character development was incomplete.  I would've loved to see more of Mace Windu and Darth Maul and less of Jar Jar Binks.  Anyway, it's a kid's movie and children will love it.  They'll probably like Jar Jar, too. Being that this was a pre-quel, it was only natural that the ending should be so foreboding, which I think was done very well.  The the framing of the 'senator' and his young apprentice was very nice.  I gave it a 7 out of 10.",7,0,0,20 May 1999
