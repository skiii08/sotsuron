Captain Marvel," A Must see before Avenger Endgame
","Last time i went in theater was years ago, I'm glad i went back to it to see Captain Marvel.This is a pretty good movie, I don't understand those negative review. You'll enjoy these 2 hours. Stay for both of the post generic scene, they are really important imo.
You have to see this if you want to see Avenger Endgame.
This movie is more of a 7,5/10 for a superhero movie, but i had to put 9 in balance for negative reviews.
Though, The movie is just a little disapoiting around the end. No, there is no feminist message (Well there are 2 sentences in the whole movie, and one of them is a joke).",7,1,6,24 March 2019
