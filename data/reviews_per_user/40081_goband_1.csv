Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Disappointing
","As much hype as there was, and as funny as the trailers were, I just felt really disappointed watching it.As others have said, it's like as if Michael Moore directed Jackass. But Jackass doesn't really have a plot, it just happens.Jackass wouldn't work with a plot, and this movie didn't really either.And to make matters worse, all the funniest parts of the movie were in all the trailers. The movie was still funny, don't get me wrong, but all the stunts were pretty predictable. The comedy came with the outrageousness of what happens. There were many tedious breaks between the comedy, which just kind of killed the momentum.",5,5,19,3 November 2006
