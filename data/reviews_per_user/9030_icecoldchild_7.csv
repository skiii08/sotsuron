Casablanca," Boggie plays it again, again, again&nobody gets bored.
","The best of 40's. Simply the best. The story about a man&woman which is not usually seen. Boggie&Bergman. One of the best couples of all times. Maybe the best. So, I watched that movie 5 or 6 times, i didn't count. But who cares? I can watch it again, and again. It's just that beautiful so you never get bored of seeing. I can't say any other thing. Oh, the best scene? My favorite is the one where Rick tells Ilsa all the pain he suffered for years and then kisses her in the dark. It just inspires me so damn much. To people who didn't see it yet: You're missing so so many things. So, just watch the movie now and start missing nothing. The life's much better like that. Play it again, Humphrey.",9,0,0,14 October 1999
10 Things I Hate About You," Don't worry, be happy
","Yes, that was the feeling of mine when i left the theater. Hakuna matata. So, it's a sweet teenage movie. But to be true, i didn't like it so damn much like She's All That. I don't know why. But, i just want to say that Julia Stiles' (the best young actress of her generation, i think. This girl rules!) Kat Stratford was one of the most realistic, smart, great characters of all the teen movies. A girl who doesn't want to act like the other ones expect her to do. Come on, that's a REAL person. I think the best things about the movie are Julia Stiles, the sequence where Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Cameron) explains to Larisa Oleynik (Bianca) what kind of person she is, and the Heath Ledger's (Patrick) song scene. These are just awesome things. But there are not-that-good things too, like how Bianca can't understand anything about Joey until the moment he starts pausing in front of her, and how can a person like Kat can sell (yeah, i can only find that word to use, sell) herself to just a GUITAR? We knew that she was in love with Patrick before, but she could resist him before, too. Hmmmm... Anyway, at the end, rent the movie&enjoy it. That's what you have to do. Again, don't worry, be happy! Or why would somebodies out there, Tinseltown, film things like that? It's just for your happiness, your smiles. Then...",7,0,0,27 September 1999
Face_Off," An action movie with real adrenaline...What we wanna see!
","That's a really great movie. It made me have cool habits like loving the cinema in a way I never did, appreciate really good actors like John Travolta (coolest&most charismatic man ever!), Nicolas Cage, and actresses like Joan Allen. Well, from the moment it starts, it makes you disconnect from the world and give your attention of life to the movie. That's a REAL action movie, like those things by Jackie Chan, where people only do those Far-East bull. THIS IS SERIOUS ENERGY! John Woo shows his real directing skills. Well, it's a must-see!",10,2,3,8 October 1999
Man on the Moon," If you believe there's nothing up my sleeve, then NOTHING is cool...
","Yeah, it's right. Then really nothing is cool. What am I saying? I don't know. It's maybe I'm really impressed by Andy's story. Maybe. But how can you be not impressed by a story like this? A story of a genius?Well, it's all there is. Andy was TOO intelligent for us. It was really more than enough.Anyway, did we come here to criticize ourselves, or the movie? So, the movie is really touching, but it lacks on laughs alittle. What we have to know before going to see the movie is, that it's not completely a comedy. Well, of course it has its moments, but the real mission is not to make people laugh to tears.Jim Carrey, one of my all-time favorite actors, in his second drama (with Truman) is awesome as always. You can see that he's living Andy. I think the greatest moment of his performance is when he finds out the secret of the cure in Phillipines:he just laughs. I laughed with him in there. My friends told me that I was crazy. Like him.At the end, I highly recommend it. It's something more than a biography, it's LIFE.",8,0,0,19 March 2000
Scream," Really worth watching.
","I've just seen Scream for the first time last night on TV. Well, before, i had watch its final, but not the whole movie. I don't think that this movie is a masterpiece, but is really worth a watching. Before i've seen it, i was thinking that it wasn't as good as people around me said, and also wasn't a movie i would really want to see. But it was. So, i found Matt Lillard's acting, um, in a way exaggerated alittle, but it doesn't count so much. Anyway, i give that movie an 8, and end the discussion.",8,0,0,2 October 1999
Braveheart," The greatest movie I have ever seen...
","Well, I don't know what to write. The only thing that I can say about the movie...you know that already. But to mention one by one, I wanna thank&congratulate Mel Gibson for his great directing in this second movie of his, Angus McFadyen, Catherine McCormack&David O'Hara for giving the best playings (although every actor in the movie are just awesome, I think they're the bests), Randall Wallace for a great script, and so on. So, I recommend it to every single one person in the world, who wants to see a miracle.",10,1,2,20 September 1999
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Attention Homer reader
","You have to pay pretty much attention to it, if you read Odysseia, the poem of Homer, because it's the best way to enjoy the movie's tricks. I don't want to spoil the movie, because it's so good, so i won't tell you any clues, just go&see. The acting is awesome (i adored Clooney&Tim Blake Nelson, as well as John Goodman), the songs are awesome (too bad it's not actually Clooney singing it!), the usual Coen kind of humor is awesome. What can i say, i loved it! It's a rather slow movie, but it just gets you in (off course, if you really want to get in), so you don't really mind that. And i, as an avid Homer reader, enjoyed it so much because i do like to think about and analyze the little secret things that happen in a movie, and this movie, as based on Odysseia and passing in 30s or 40s, i don't know, has lots of stuff that i like. Highly, highly, highly recommended.",10,0,0,25 March 2001
