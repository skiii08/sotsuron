The Devil's Advocate," don't waste your time on predictable movie
","I'm not sure what movie these other people watched, but there is absolutely nothing redeeming about this movie.  About 3 minutes in, you can predict the entire movie, and it plods along for another 2:21, complete with gratuitous nudity, 'special' effects, and a dreadful pace.  This movie is an example of picking an easy target ('vanity') and building a ridiculous premise and blatant imagery.  A waste. 3/10",3,5,13,15 December 1998
