Ford v Ferrari," They Took the American Dream for a Ride!
","I love this film!!! I experienced this in 4DX for the first time in Pico Rivera, California. The high price of $20.25 for admission was really worth it. 4DX put me in the driver's seat. This is a cinema technology from Korea that gives motion to a group of seats in the theater. The cinema that I attended had the seats arranged in groups of four. Imagine a roller coaster simulated in a movie theater. The seats also let you feel the rumble of the car engines and lights in the auditorium add the finishing touches such as sparks.Ford v Ferrari is a movie about the Le Mans, France 24 hour race that pitted the Ford Motor company vs. the all-time winner Ferrari. More than that, it is about the friendship between American car engineer Carroll Shelby and the unsung hero English car racer Ken Miles.Have you ever wanted to experience what it's like to be in the pilot's seat of a race car? This is the perfect film to test drive the 4DX system at a theater near you. I recommend it.",9,4,7,20 November 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Star Wars Reawakens
","This is how you reawaken the Force. This is what happens when you take out Jar Jar Abrams out of the production: you get a better picture. Whenever I used to go to see a Star Wars movie, I felt like a kid again. I loved going with my parents to the movies and having a good time. I miss those good old days from the 1980's and 90's. Upon seeing Episode VII I felt disappointment. Something didn't click right. The problem was Abrams directing in the wrong direction and writing for the wrong generation audience and Disney not caring for Lucas' true vision of the saga.Here we have a fresh new start. Disney went totally rogue! I love the multi ethnic cast. Episode IV's prologue is retold in this film. Simple formula and it works. At first I was against the idea. I felt an in-between chapter was not necessary fearing it would cheapen A New Hope. Clearly I was wrong and as a Star Wars fan I am satisfied with the story. I felt like a kid again at the conclusion of this movie! I hope Disney does not make it a habit, though. May the Force Be With You Carrie Fisher. RIP. You will be missed.",9,3,10,27 December 2016
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The Saga Concludes
","This completes a more epic Star Wars saga. It was kind of strange to see the Roman numeral IX on the big screen. My generation is getting old. Yet I always feel like a child sitting in the movie theater with at least one of my parents next to me. Star Wars makes me feel young and it is sad to see this is the real end. I was overall pleased and this sequel trilogy finally redeemed itself after a shaky start. I complained about The Force Awakens, then I saw improvement in The Last Jedi and finally The Rise of Skywalker makes it feel like the old Star Wars with old characters returning for nostalgia.One thing is that having J.J. Abrams returning to write and direct had me worried. He went back to the winning formula of Return of the Jedi which is a big part of the reason why Episode IX works. It was nice to see recycled and unused footage of Carrie Fisher to complete the trilogy. Some of the mystery plot points in this saga are solved and it opens up other questions.The Rise of Skywalker does this trilogy justice. Go see it with your family and a new generation.",9,4,11,24 December 2019
Back to the Future Part III," Back To The Old West
","It's back to the past in this last sequel of a great epic time- traveling trilogy. In Part III Fox and Lloyd are joined by Steenburgen. The Doc finally solves the other great mystery of the universe; women. It's great to see his character grow and have a romance in an unexpected time period. I believe this plot element was beautifully handled.Once more the duo have a problem returning to the future, which is their present time, which is now the past. Gasoline of all things is now the culprit. But that doesn't stop the genius Doctor Brown from coming up with a plan to get home.I saw this in my teens at my local cinema as a double feature. This movie has it all: cowboys, gun showdown, romance, science fiction, and a train robbery...or was it just a science experiment?The future is what you make of it.",8,2,2,21 October 2015
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Star Wars is Back in Full Force
","Disney did the right thing to replace J.J. Abrams and bringing back the master George Lucas to show them how it's done right. Episode VIII is really good and Mark Hamill really pulls off his best acting. Luke Skywalker is awesome!! The crowd in the movie theater cheered when he dueled and beat Kylo Ren. I was satisfied with 'The Last Jedi' as part of the big saga. I will not bore you with a detailed summary. There are a few noticeable problems. There is some prominent feminism in the scene involving women commanders. You can really feel the estrogen in the room and how these women were poorly chosen just to make Carrie Fisher look good. Back in the good old days Princess Leia was a tough character who was much more than just a doll face. Laura Dern is badly miscast as Vice Admiral Holdo. Her character is weak but she does what she can with the material that she was given. Other than that, this film is a super blast! Go and see it!!!",9,1,3,3 January 2018
Back to the Future Part II," The Future Is Now...
",We caught up to the future which is now the present and after today will be the past. I saw this one in a drive-in theater and I was confused the first time I saw it.I didn't enjoy it as much as Part I. Still Part II showed us some old gags in a new way that were still interesting. Flying cars and hoverboards made an impression on me forever. When I was a teenager the future seemed so far away and I waited 26 years for a flying car. I did own a DeLorean for almost three years last decade but it never flew. Spielberg with Zemeckis and Gale showed us something to look forward to in the future in a funny way with all the possibilities of things that might happen.I enjoyed most Fox and Lloyd working together as a team to fix the future and the present while preserving the past. Sound confusing? It was at first but they pulled it off. Don't take it too seriously and have fun.The future is what you make of it.,7,0,1,21 October 2015
Blade Runner," Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?
","When I first saw this on TV as a child, I thought it was boring. Later in my early college years I began to appreciate what a masterpiece this is. Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? What a concept for a title. Philip K. Dick was original. The score by Vangelis sets the mood and is unforgettable.The 5-Disc Collector's Blu-ray set from 2007 is the ideal set since it includes many versions including the theatrical cut from 1982 and the Director's Cut from 1992. The International cut is the same as the US version with more graphic violence.There are a multitude of special features including deleted scenes, and many documentaries running over three hours long!I love the restoration that this movie deserves. I was disappointed by one thing only: The Final Cut is not complete on my set. The documentaries clearly showed new special effects with some scenes restored to their intended glory. The Workprint and Final Cut clearly did not have the finished restoration effects that were promised. So much hype and in the end they seemed to have forgotten to include them. I checked disc 1 and 5; both are unfinished.Maybe the Final Cut Blu-ray edition from 2011 has the completed scenes. My favorite version will always be the Director's Cut because it includes the unicorn dream sequence.Take the Voight-Kampff test and put this cyberpunk classic in your collections if you are a replicant or a Blade Runner!",9,1,3,27 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars for A New Generation
","I am a big Star Wars fan and I like almost everything about it, from the movies to the toys. Most people disliked the prequels from last decade feeling that Lucas was losing his touch. I liked Episode I just fine. Now Episode VII is a different story. Lucas made a mistake in selling his franchise to Disney. This story was OK but not great. The villain most of all feels weak and I cannot understand his intentions for turning to the Dark Side. It seems to me that Lucas and Disney have turned to the Dark Side. This Star Wars is for a different generation than my own but why did they forget about mine? We are the loyal fans from the good old days when things were done right. Now our favorite characters are forced to take a back seat while younger nobodies take the helm. Perhaps Abrams is the wrong choice for this type of production. I hope Disney changes writing and directing staff in a more correct direction for the remaining two sequels.",8,5,33,2 February 2016
Back to the Future," If You Put Your Mind To It You Can Accomplish Anything
",My favorite time travel trilogy as a teenager. I remember watching this on home video back in 1988 and I loved it. My father and I later returned it to the video store and asked the owner if there were more sequels planned. He said probably never. To our surprise the following year Universal Studios announced two sequels. There was a big ad banner with Michael J. Fox during the tour of the Studios.There are so many wonderful memories captured in this film. It is absolutely amazing that 30 years have passed since it was first shown in theaters. This one along with the Time Machine (1960) are the best movies ever made about time travel.The future is what you make of it.,9,0,0,21 October 2015
