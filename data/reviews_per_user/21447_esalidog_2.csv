Antz," Script, Voices, Message & Music...For Kids & Adults
","Without being a big fan of animation movies, the time I've spent watching Antz has been fantastic. This is a magnificent apology for individualism, and no one better than Woody Allen turned into an ant to star in it ... the voices of other actors like Sylvester Stallone, Sharon Stone or Gene Hackman do nothing but improve the work ... And even more , a magnificent soundtrack with emotional moments and others of laughter such as when Guantanamera or John Lennon's Give Peace A Change sound. Great for kids and adults.",7,0,0,12 April 2020
Joker," Just an adaptation
","It´s ok if they wanted to give this movie an Scorsese´s Taxi-Driver vibe, but was too obvious at times...
At the same time, I think the Joker deserved a better Origin story...but I hate Origin stories with some characters as Marvel´s Wolverine or DC´s Joker,so...I never liked the classic comic-book The Killing Joke for the same reason, so maybe I´m not the most objective.
The 7 points I give this movie are because Phoenix, he is the dude who looks more like the Joker I ever seen, if he wasn't in this movie, it would have been less points..",7,1,1,29 October 2019
