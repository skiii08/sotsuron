Hereditary," A highly overrated VERY slow burn movie
","Went because I like A24 films and horror. Though A24 has burned us before with the very meh IT COMES AT NIGHT. Heredity is well made, well acted, but my lord, the pacing. Wayyyy too slow. 20 minutes too long. Do not get the 94% RT score. 79-80 tops. No way in hell this is the next generation in horror. Seen this movie before and never really scared at all. The Exorcist is the greatest horror of all time. This movie doesnt come close. Sundance over-hype.",7,2,5,9 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A damn, fun, exciting movie! Trust the AUDIENCE RT score, not the critic score!
","The critics are wrong: 'The Rise of Skywalker' is a terrific, fast-paced, exciting, funny, dramatic movie that ends on a perfect not. Contains many great plot twists and surprises. Consider too, JJ had the lead star die before production started and stepped in for a fired director.Seen it twice already, will see it a third time. Like going on a thrill-ride at Disneyland!Go with the 88% audience score on this one!",10,4,9,20 December 2019
