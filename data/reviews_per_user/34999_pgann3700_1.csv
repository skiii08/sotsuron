It," Had high expectations for this...but was sadly a dud :/
",Was truly excited to see this film based on its high marks...was thoroughly disappointed though. Pretty sure the high ratings came from teenagers maybe? Plot was slow to develop and the child actors were hard to grasp onto. CGI was non-believable and juvenile. Movie tried too hard and failed miserably in my opinion. Don't recommend spending money on it.,3,12,26,11 September 2017
