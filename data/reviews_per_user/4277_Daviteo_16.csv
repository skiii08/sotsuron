The Lobster," Couldn't stand this movie.
","Contains spoilers.First, I'm a fan of quirky films, indie movies, and stuff that's generally non- mainstream (in addition to regular mainstream stuff like Star Wars or whatnot), so I was curious about this film from the trailer. I get that this film is a satire about finding true love, including a host of other interesting ethical questions, but in doing so it tries to be as off-putting as possible, as if to say 'only smart people will make it through this film.' In essence, it's a pompous movie. I've seen plenty of smart, challenging films that don't insult the audience by showing how smart the director or writer is.From the get go, you're going to be watching long-takes, which is fine, I love well-composed shots, except the shots and cinematography in this film are not particularly interesting nor well-composed.You're also going to have to sit through a first hour of dialogue that's delivered so stilted (for the sake of satire) you'll wonder how these A-List actors could possibly be in a film that's acted worse than your first-grader's play.The film opens up a little after the halfway point and becomes more human, but it took everything for me to make it through that first hour. I'm just riffing here, but every line sounds and is delivered about as thinly as it's written below:'Would you like to have some tea?'Awkward pause.'Yes. I think I would like to have some tea. Thank you. That is very nice.''You are welcome. I'm glad I can give you some tea that will make you happy.''That is a very nice thing of you to say to me. I will remember that you are a kind person.''At the hotel, here, we all try to be kind to each other. For if you do not have kindness, what else do you have.'Awkward pause.'Yes ...'Awkward pause.'... That is true. Okay. Then. I think it will be good if we kiss now.''Very well. How would you like your kiss?''I think on the lips. Thank you.'Awkward pause. They kiss for ten seconds.'It was nice to kiss you.''You are welcome. I will go now.''Okay.'It was nearly impossible for me to make it through the first act, let alone the first half film. The writer and director were trying to be too smart for their own good and in turn try their best to alienate the viewers to show their intelligence. I love smart movies, just not ones that purposefully try to tick me off as a mode of emotional engagement.",5,4,5,1 February 2017
Captain Marvel," It's 'fine,' 'okay,' and loads of other words that mean 'eh.'
","This film is the equivalent of unbuttered toast or a glass of flat Coke. It doesn't do anything risky, and it made my eyes glaze over in the middle. There's nothing inherently *wrong* about it, and from a technical standpoint it's fine, but it hits all the notes that a paint-by-numbers superhero movie would hit.On the plus side, it fills in a few MCU mythos gaps, some CGI was impressive, and probably will make for a neat little setup for Endgame.Finally, a friend of mine who thought that The Last Jedi was the greatest of all the live-action Star Wars movies loved this move, so I guess make of that as you will...",7,3,9,11 March 2019
Passengers," Like a dubstep version of Clair de Lune
","Passengers needs to be commended on some beautiful imagery and transcendent music by the ever-classy Thomas Newman (which actually makes the film a bit too whimsical in places where a deeper dramatic reading should occur). But the main problem is the movie feels like a Hollywood exec note-fest 'move this part along faster,' or 'don't get too deep here' (a problem particularly noticeable in the film's second and third acts). Passengers could have been a first-rate film like Titanic but is stuck languishing in 'decent Hollywood adventure/romance' almost entirely because of pacing problems. Because of that, I give it an even 7/10: it's worth a watch and is fun, but I wish it pushed just a little harder and gave us a classic.",7,0,0,7 December 2018
The Impossible," What a punch in the gut
","I checked this movie out because of the actors, and damn did they deliver. Ewan McGreggor and Naomi Watts are superb, as always, but it's Tom Holland (in his first breakout role) that steals the show. Arguably, he's the central character (although all three of those actors take center stage at various times), and he easily showcases a star on the rise.The film itself is a sucker punch. It hits hard and keeps you hooked either through suspense or heartache. One caveat though: this is by far the most intense and difficult PG-13 film I've ever seen. I'm sure it was rated R until it was toned down for the MPAA, and it probably squeaked by with it's PG-13 rating by only a hair. If you're have difficulty with reality based trauma or are in a headspace that might not tolerate this well, give it some time before you see it--it doesn't hold back what being in a tsunami would feel like. I actually thought it WAS rated R until I checked out the IMDb page.Overall, this is a good watch and a story that should be seen.",8,11,11,7 December 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Oscar-worthy performance
","This review contains spoilers.Let's get the bad out of the way right up front:<ul><li>The CG of the crowd during the Live-Aid performance at the end of the movie was jarring-it's not good compositing and almost threw me out of the suspension of disbelief of the film.</li></ul><ul><li>The troubles Brian May and the other band members had throughout their years playing are glossed over.</li></ul><ul><li>There are some factual inaccuracies (according to IMDB trivia, the band was not disbanded in the months before Live Aid, for instance, and didn't have to 'get back in tune,' so to speak).</li></ul><ul><li>It was mostly directed by Brian Singer (I believe this is his best film), who has had allegations against him in this era of troubling Weinstein sexual harassment and assault occurrences. So the film succeeds on artistic merit, but one has to separate the artist from the art in this case. Singer was also apparently fired two weeks before filming wrapped due to absences and a different director was brought in to bring the movie home and oversee post production.</li></ul>With that being said, I've never been a huge fan of Queen, but Bohemian Rhapsody got me interested! My wife wanted to see this and I've been a fan of Rami Malek's since Mr. Robot's pilot episode, so I was happy to go along. Holy hot damn does he deliver on every front-emotionally, physically (he worked with a performance coach to get Mercury's performance nuances down pat), verbally, everything about Malek's performance is on point. I was blown away at how he lost himself in the role. Blown away. Although it's a standard rise, fall, rise biopic, there were undercurrents of taboos addressed that strongly resonated in this hyper-political age (pop-culture stardom vs. traditional Pakistani heritage, for example, or the 70s and 80s stigma of being gay in a religious household).Theatrically, the songs, music, momentum, feel of Queen through the 70s and 80s was captured wonderfully through great cinematography and set/wardrobe design and I loved seeing the styles change without calling them out specifically.Finally, I hope Malek wins an Oscar for this role.Solid 8.5 or 8.6 out of 10, so I rounded up to a 9.",9,0,1,5 November 2018
A Quiet Place," Sooooo close to being a masterpiece
","This review contains potential spoilers.Man oh man, this movie was 'this' close to being a masterpiece but it's like a perfect gym routine but the gymnast sprains her ankle on the final dismount. The film ended about 15 minutes too early, and even though it was a drama with horror movie elements, we needed closure to the wife and kids' stories. Aside from some small lapses in logic, I was hooked and completely onboard with the fiction of the film, but man, that ending just didn't stick the landing. Still highly recommended.",8,0,2,22 December 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," So torn
","Spoilers ahead. You've been warned.Last Jedi felt like a fantastic, amazingly delicious candy that ended up breaking your tooth and giving you a massive stomach bug.I'm completely torn on the movie. From a technical perspective the movie was superb (except for one set of scenes in a space casino-you'll know it when you see it): acting (Adam Diver, holy cow! Amazing), CG, costumes, set design, music, cinematography (wow was that good!). I'm giving the movie an 8 for those aspects.But story and plot-wise, they kept throwing out important stuff.You know that main plot for the entire movie that's keeping the good guys in danger? Just kidding. Doesn't matter.You know that one super important character that's been set up? Just kidding. Doesn't matter.You know those super important things from Force Awakens that needed to be addressed? Just kidding. Doesn't matter.You know how 'that's not how the force works?' Just kidding. Doesn't matter.You know that one super special secret people have been debating about? Just kidding. Doesn't matter.You know how you care about this one person and they're about to bite it? Just kidding. Doesn't matter.So in the moment in the theater I was hooked, but looking back on it, there was so much wrong with it.",7,0,0,18 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Second viewing review
","MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!I had already reviewed TLJ once here but I believe this is one of the few movies that requires another review after a second viewing. First, my score of 7 stands, which will be explained below.I believe this is the most inconsistent movie in the Star Wars series. While The Force Awakes was a pretty solid 8.5, maybe 8.6 throughout, The Last Jedi moves from points of pure cinematic greatness at a 9.7 to head-slapping 'why did they decide that' scores of 4. I've averaged it out to be around a 7. I'll break down everything below.THE ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC:<ul><li>The score, the cinematography, and the continued use of practical effects (except Canto Bite, which I'll explain later); I really applaud the use of practical effects in this and Force Awakens after the prequels.</li></ul><ul><li>Rian Johnson is a 'filmmaker' in the full sense of the word and the callbacks to Kurosawa, among other great filmmakers, is refreshing. Snoke's throne room is still a sight to behold... something easily right out of RAN. The Rashoman 'three different perspectives on the same event' flashbacks between Luke and Kylo I felt were a nice touch.</li></ul><ul><li>Although I completely hated it at first, I've come to accept and even like Poe's character arc going from a hothead who got reprimanded at every turn to someone who could lead the resistance when, at the very end, Leia says, 'What are you waiting for, follow HIM.'</li></ul><ul><li>There are some visual moments, like Luke's astral projection when standing in front of the First Order's ships and AT-ATs on Crait with the sun, orange and bright and bilnding behind them, that will go down in Star Wars top ten lists as most amazing visuals. Speaking of the astral projection, it was a stroke of genius to make Luke physically look how Kylo remembered, have the old lightsaber Kylo remembered, and also not leave any marks in the salt on the ground.</li></ul><ul><li>I can accept Holdo now. This was supposed to be Luke's movie, so Leia had to be gone from the narrative for a little while (the coma) so we could focus on Luke. But they still wanted a strong female leader. So Johnson wrote General Holdo, (as very feminine, from clothing to demeanor). But she's still a general. I get that and I kind of like it. It's kind of a nice new take on masculine leadership. No, her sacrifice at the end isn't as shocking as if it were Leia, but this wasn't supposed to be Leia's movie. I'm warming up to Holdo as the leader of the resistance in Leia's absence (also, how cool is it that the princess we met so long ago in a detention cell ends up being the leader of the resistance).</li></ul>
SOME CLARIFICATIONS:<ul><li>The bomber dropping bombs downward in space: some people think this is a problem at the beginning of the film. The bombs are in a ship that has artificial gravity. Once the bombs leave the ship, they'll still be traveling in the direction that they were pulled when inside the ship. I think this is considered a goof but isn't.</li></ul><ul><li>The sacred texts: There's a quick shot of all the sacred texts tucked away safely on the Falcon. Rey took them. When Yoda ignited the tree (I'm still 50/50 on that scene), he says something to the effect of 'Rey has everything she needs.' He means that the texts are on the Falcon. They're safe.</li></ul><ul><li>Snoke's death: I'm still miffed that we learned nothing about Snoke. But many people say that he would have foreseen his death. Upon rewatching the film, Kylo is very careful to make it look like his intentions are to murder Rey. Snoke even narrates this when he says something to the effect of 'I feel your hatred, I feel you turning the light saber.' At that moment, Kylo turns BOTH his lightsaber and the Rey's, that's on the throne, so that he masks everything he does. He lets Snoke see his actions but not the full intent. So I believe, upon second viewing, Snoke wouldn't have seen it coming. And Kylo knew this, which is why he purposefully used Rey to achieve this-he probably couldn't have done it without her. (However, that space Skype stuff still seems like a ham-fisted way to get Kylo and Rey in the same room together).</li></ul><ul><li>Broom boy: I don't think this is meant to be 'the next Luke.' This is just meant to show there are many force-sensitive people in the galaxy and being myopic about the Sith and Jedi is too near-sighted.</li></ul>
THE MIND-NUMBINGLY STUPID:<ul><li>Luke did NOT need redemption. The reason he's such an insufferable jerk is that Johnson wanted Luke to be redeemed and ultimately return to using the force and helping the resistance. Luke, as we knew him at the end of Return of the Jedi. I still honestly believe is in a place that in no way he would have fallen so far from that version of himself that he'd need redemption from ANYONE. He'd be a wizened, sure, version of the doe-eyed farm boy from Tatooine that found the good in his father and brought him back to the light. This is sill my #1 problem with this movie.</li></ul><ul><li>Leia's Mary Poppins space flight. This wasn't set up in any way. She should have moved a small object using the force. We should have been clued in in a small way she could do this. Or just cut it completely (I mean, she WAS on the bridge of a ship that blew up-her internal organs would be goo anyway). If they had to write her out for a little while so we could focus on Luke, there are a million different ways they could do that.</li></ul><ul><li>Admiral Ackbar: Should have been given a much better farewell. It's a person in a suit and could have been played by anyone. He could have gone out saying, 'IT'S A TRA-' Bam. Again, sometimes I think Johnson didn't actually watch the original films or Force Awakens.</li></ul><ul><li>The super-slow space chase. I don't buy 'we can't keep up with one resistance ship' for a moment. The First Order could have called in backup-I'm sure they have backup somewhere in the galaxy-to warp directly in front of the resistance. Or they could have warped one of their OWN ships light years away, turned around and then warped back. I'm still extremely disappointed in this plot device.</li></ul><ul><li>Rose: She was a NARC. I loved most of the female cast, and am warming up greatly to Holdo, but Rose still annoys the heck out of me. You're not a friend to someone (Finn) if, at every turn, you tell him that he's just messed up. She comes across as excessively annoying (not a knock on the actor Kelly Tran, who I think IS a good actor).</li></ul><ul><li>Space horses: Rose and Finn free a whole bunch of space horses but not the SLAVE KIDS that are standing right next to them? Still bugs me.</li></ul><ul><li>Canto Bite: I could go on about all the things wrong with this, BB8 TYING up guards, it basically looking like an extended prequel sequence, why did Finn and Rose park their ship on the beach when they're trying to be sneaky and spy-like, why do they trust Benicio, who's pretty much as shady as they come). I get that both Rose and Finn had to fail their mission to recruit the actual master codebreaker so that they could learn lessons about who to trust, but the entire sequence on Canto Bite looks, feels, and is even written like the prequels. It's cheesy, badly acted, and unnecessary.</li></ul><ul><li>C-3PO's lack of red arm: we're lead to believe Force Awakens takes place just minutes our hours before Last Jedi. Who fixed 3P0's arm? Again, did Johnson not watch Force Awakens?</li></ul><ul><li>General Hux and Captain Phasma: Hux is completely different, this sniveling little urchin, than the previous movie, which is supposed to show him as rising to be the galaxy's most dangerous right-hand man (like his speech to the huge army of stormtroopers in Force Awakes, straight out of a Nazi playbook). Hux, again, is underused, says a few lines then BAM, dead... or... so... we... think... Who knows at this point.</li></ul><ul><li>Re-using so many cues from episodes 5 and 6. This movie rehashes too many beats from Empire and Return of the Jedi. The throne-room 'watch the good guys get blown up in ships' moment, Crait being Hoth but with salt, the 'dark side cave' Luke goes into in 5 and Rey goes into in this.</li></ul><ul><li>Runtime. Shouldn't have been two-and-a-half hours. There's so much one could cut from the middle to get it down to a solid two.</li></ul>
So in short, this is a deeply flawed movie that's offset but astounding strokes of genius, absolute genius, and is one of the reasons it's so hard for me to score it. Some parts were high 9s and others were 4s. I give it a 7 as an average. I hope episode 9 is much more consistent.",7,3,10,6 July 2018
Midsommar," Immediate thoughts
","I'm writing this about four minutes after watching the film on iTunes. First, Midsommar is definitely 'art house horror' like Hereditary was. I'd put it in the vein of Rosemary's Baby and The Shining. I bet this and Hereditary could be considered horror classics in fifty years.What this movie is NOT is some mainstream splatter fest. Like Hereditary, I'm guessing this will will sit with me for a while, take its time to be digested, allow me to contemplate its every detail.Now, I think Ari Aster may have gone a little too far on the weirdness in some places, but possibly only a few inches further from Hereditary. And there were a couple things he wrote in, dialogue and action, that could almost be considered silly. But I still give him the benefit of doubt in being, in my opinion, one of the best horror filmmakers of the 2000s.With that being said, the film is certainly not for everyone. It'll make you think; it'll evoke deep and troubling feelings. It's not a straightforward blood fest. You have to be comfortable with uncertainty and strangeness and mixed genres going in. You have to be okay with a 2 1/2 hour meditation on grief and loss and confusion that's sometimes quite slow or even seemingly happy.But if you're still interested in the film, you'll find an absolutely gorgeously shot, beautifully scored, well acted, bright, colorful art house horror movie that will stay with you much longer than any dark slasher pic could.",8,2,2,12 December 2019
Sinister," It was just okay.
","Just finished Sinister a few minutes ago. It was decent as a horror film, but didn't really bring anything terribly new to the table. It has some jump scares, some earned and some cheap. It only sort of stuck the landing at the end. I ended up liking watching Ethan Hawke's performance the best out of all aspects of the movie, and the extended, one-take conversations and argument scenes with his wife were quite good. However, this felt like it would have been much better as a 30 short in a horror anthology rather than a full feature. There just wasn't enough story to cover the time they had, and therefore it felt slow (and not in a 'slow burn' type of way but more of a 'spinning their wheels' sort of way to fill time). But I'm glad the performances were good.",6,0,0,24 October 2019
War of the Worlds," Fantastic 4/5 of a movie
","This review will have spoilers for War of the Worlds AND the film Jurassic Park.War of the Worlds is Spielberg at his meanest and also his third-darkest (with Schindler's List being first and Saving Private Ryan being second). This film is also sort of a crossroads between what defines a 'popcorn' movie and what makes something deeper.But first, to get the ending out of the way, yes, it sucks. To have Robbie suddenly appear at a pristine Boston home with his parents who, for whatever reason, are a safe haven from the madness of the alien invasion is asinine. But this film shares more similarities with Jurassic Park than any other Spielberg movie and that filmâ€”although people seemed fine with itâ€”had an asinine ending as well when the T-Rex seemingly appears out of nowhere to save Grant, Ellie and the kids. And for those people who say Ray in this movie became too much of a hero, Grant became one as well in Jurassic Park. I feel the two mirror each other closely, even though Jurassic Park (which is still one of my favorites) has just as many problems with it. And anyone who got annoyed with Dakota Fanning here, well, I'd just like to showcase Exhibit B where Lex shines a megawatt flashlight directly into a T-Rex's eyes.There are also issues with Spielberg ignoring his own rules, so for instance near the beginning of the movie an EMP wipes out all electrical devices but people are still seen in the street with cameras and camcorders. But something similar happened in Jurassic Park when we see the downed jeeps parked in front of the fence right before the main T-Rex attack and the goat, ground, and trees are all basically at road-level. However, after the T-Rex attack and Grant, with the kids, are stuck in the car and the T-Rex pushes the car toward the segment of fence it came out of, there's suddenly a 50-foot drop. There are countless other small problems with Jurassic Park, but again people seem more favorable to that film than this.So with those problems asideâ€”'rules' issues and the endingâ€”I still give this movie an 8 out of 10 for the sheer darkness it portrays humanity like during a time of crisis. There are heroes. There are also people who want to take advantage of others. I will never forget the shock I felt at seeing Ray's van being stolen from him at gunpoint and almost losing his daughter who was stuck inside. I was also shocked at how closely the film used a 9/11 metaphor when the Tripods start shooting civilians on the street and then the people burst into ash (and, for those who wonder why it didn't destroy clothing, maybe the beams only affect organic matterâ€”I never thought it was a problem, and seeing the clothing go flying off everyone was terrifying).I believe this film gave Spielberg the opportunity to take popcorn movies like Close Encounters, E.T., JAWS, and Jurassic Park and filter them through the lens of a more mature filmmaker who had done Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, and the result is something pretty astounding. So yes, it's flawed, it has problems (as most Spielberg films have), but then again most movies in general have problemsâ€”I mean, think about the actual logistics of a man dressed as a bat in 100-pound body armor crouching on a skyscraper parapet in The Dark Knight and who's fighting a homicidal clown, which, incidentally, is also one of my favorite films. I think people have a hard time looking past the flaws of this film and seeing what's actually a terrifying look at people trying desperately to keep it together during a national emergency.",8,1,3,20 July 2017
Joker," This generation's Taxi Driver
","When DC took a risk on Todd Phillip's R-rated Joker, I don't think they actually knew what they were doing, because if they did, it would have been a much tamer version of what we got. This movie is an unflinching look at the rise and rise of Gotham's psychopathic clown prince of crime, and man does it not flinch. It (narrowly) takes the title from The Dark Knight as the best comic book-based movie ever made.",9,0,0,21 April 2020
Life," Decent sci-fi/horror
","LIFE, which I gave a 7 out of 10, fits right between 6-and-under 'crap' and 8-and-above 'excellent.' LIFE is par for the course for sci-fi/horror. Doesn't bring much new but doesn't trip up too terribly badly. Acting, cinematography, and directing were mostly solid. There were a couple nice shots, but also some cribbed from Gravity. CGI was a little spotty in parts and the music was just for backround ambience.Couple things I wish were better:<ul><li>Although the acting was good, and I'm a fan of all the actors, I never felt like these were real people on board the ISS and I certainly didn't feel like they were scientists. There's also a lot of 'seal the air lock door before the air escapes and we're doomed if the air escapes'-type dialogue instead of 'seal bay 1138 before depressurization and increase to .3-make that .4-on outer O-ring imepedance.' I'm just making that up, but it would have been nice to hear more science jargon instead of Hollywood dialogue.</li></ul><ul><li>They had sound fx in the vacuum of space.</li></ul><ul><li>Like a lot of average sci fi and horror movies, there were quite a few times when you go, 'ahhhh, don't do *that* thing! It's so stupid!' Never really rose above that to be clever or refreshingly new, but the movie was executed well enough not to be complete nonsense.</li></ul>So it lands at a semi-wobbly 7 out of 10 for me.",7,1,1,18 January 2019
Annihilation," Deserves a higher rating
","The film can definitely split viewers. I can see how it might misfire and put off some viewers. It's slow, thought provoking, layered, and thematic, but that's what I like about it. It does spoon feed you at times, at least insofar as what the plot's about, but it leaves its themes fairly open for interpretation (even though some of those are fairly straightforward). In my opinion it was tighter and better paced than the book, but it sticks to the source material closely. Visuals were striking. I'd put it up there with Arrival as two recent sci fi films to check out if you haven't.",8,1,2,29 September 2018
Spectre," (Spoilers) I don't get the hate
","This post contains spoilers.I don't get the hate. I just don't. Specter seemed a great return to form of the classic Bond tropes. I'l start with the positives: the one-take Mexico shot at the beginning was nice, and the helicopter set piece was thrilling (if a bit CG-ish). I like how the 00-section seems like a working organization with the new M in charge (not that Dench's wasn't, but that had become too personal I felt). Money penny is played nicely, even if she doesn't have that much to do. And the evolution of Blowfeld was nice (and for those criticizing Waltz's performance as not being scary, have you seen Inglorious Basterds? He played a similar character there and his terrifying diabolical-ness is masked by a cheerful disposition—I felt he did a good job). Although we got another helicopter scene at the end, I thought that was thrilling as well and I kept thinking 'are they going to kill the new Blowfeld his first movie out?' People thinking the music was terrible must not have seen many of the mid-Connery movies because this fit right in with a mid-run Bond film that's neither the beginning nor end of an actor's term.The bad: action scenes were a bit cliché and the sudden transformation of the heroine from 'I hate you' to 'let's do it' actually had me saying 'ugh.But Spectre seemed right on par with Rogue Nation—classy, subdued, and very Bond. Was it as good as Casino Royale (my favorite Craig Bond film)? No. But nothing short of a soft reboot with a different actor will fix that. This felt like a perfect mid-run Bond film with a classic villain and a solid cast firing (and of course a few times mis-firing) on all cylinders. I wish IMDb could give half ratings because this felt more like a 7.4 or 7.5 to me.",7,1,4,22 February 2016
Alien: Covenant," Solid dark fantasy horror with some mis-steps in characters and motivation (totally contains spoilers!)
","Alien: Covenant is a solid dark fantasy horror film with a lot of good going for it but a few massive mis-steps along the way.First, the god: special effects, atmosphere, and mood were on par with any other Ridley Scott film save for the astounding original ALIEN and Blade Runner, which were masterpieces. Cinematography is solid, acting by the three principle characters, while not jaw-dropping, was decent (especially Waterston—I hope to see her in a lot of other films, and Fassbender brought his A-Game as always), and although this wasn't a straight-up horror film like ALIEN as it had a more dark fantasy vibe, I enjoyed that.Second, the problems. There were a few but they were pretty severe. Spoilers ahead. The biggest problem my wife and and I had with the film was that this team of scientists go to an alien planet effectively on a whim and proceed to make massively stupid decisions:<ul><li>The crew doesn't do any analysis of the alien planet before flying down to investigate.</li></ul><ul><li>The crew doesn't send the android (or presumably robots—they have robots in the future, right?) down first but instead takes a whole human team.</li></ul><ul><li>They land they drop ship on WATER instead of trying to find fertile ground. Any sort of parasite or small insect could be hiding there.</li></ul><ul><li>They disembark the drop ship without MASKS and then proceed to touch and interact with their surroundings without caution. In fact, not wearing a mask is the main reason the problems start happening ... twice. There must have been some sort of mouth, nose, ear covering they could have scrounged up if they didn't actually have them on the ship (which they should have!).</li></ul><ul><li>On an alien landscape, WATCH WHERE YOU STEP! And don't touch anything! If we ever did find a habitable planet, we probably wouldn't get attacked by extra terrestrial creatures but instead the biggest threat would be bacteria, parasites, all things microscopic.</li></ul><ul><li>When investigating a giant city full of dead bodies ... ask your host about what the hell happened!</li></ul><ul><li>Don't wash your wounds in alien water!</li></ul><ul><li>Don't look directly into an alien pod!</li></ul>Basically the main issues in the film were tactical and preparatory. There were a few others, such as the xenomorph taking minutes to mature when in ALIEN it took almost a day, and some other quibbling problems. Also, this is billed as a horror film but I found it to be more of a dark sci-fi fantasy (which I actually enjoyed). It's a good setup for a third film and has several nifty surprises (not 'twists,' per se, but things that make you go 'aha!') and it ties up a lot of loose ends from Prometheus. And the Hannibal-like dark operatic mood during the second act of the film is great (particularly when David and Walther have conversations on the nature of serving in heaven vs reigning in hell). But you'll have to overlook some massively stupid human decisions about 1/3 of the way through the film to get to that point.",7,19,35,21 May 2017
