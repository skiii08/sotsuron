Insidious: Chapter 2," Dreadful
","The only thing really scary about this movie is that people seem to have loved it. Compared to screen gems as The Exorcist, The Entity( with B. Hershey too ), The Omen, Scanners, The Thing, Rec, The Haunting, Dawn of the Dead, Night of the Living Dead, it has absolutely nothing to offer : no characters, no atmosphere at all ( fumes ARE NOT atmosphere ), very bad storytelling, mediocre acting, a very messy story, and terrible wanna be fun moments that have nothing to do in a movie supposed to scare you. The Conjuring was far better imho, avoid this one at all costs ! I wonder how much people have been paid to review this mess as 'the movie that would stop the earth from spinning were it a bit scarier'. By the way, stop putting Ã  10/10 from a movie that is 'scary but not a great movie' ! Movies that deserve a 10/10 should be a handful at most and not some rubbish made to make money on behalf of no brainers under 18 who have seen at most a 100 film in their lives( 'the best horror movie I have ever seen' ). Pathetic !",3,31,60,9 December 2013
Barry Lyndon," Mesmerizing, cinematography at its best
","I will not get into reviewing the history of the movie, as there are plenty of analysis on IMDb which are great in doing so.I personally think this is Kubrick's best movie by far, having seen them all, and seen again ( again recently, 2001, the Shining, A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket ).As another reviewer perfectly said, Barry Lyndon is like a moving 3 hour long Caravaggio display, with a haunting soundtrack and every shot is just perfect.I often enrage at seeing any movie on IMDb rated 10/10 over any pretext and I imagine most of these rating are made by teenagers without enough experience or maturity to make a decent critic about a movie.As a moviegoer myself and son of a real movie frantic, being 43 now, I must have seen about 5 000 to 10 000 movies in my lifetime, of all genres and all countries. For 20 years now I have sticked to having only four 10/10 movies that immediately come to my mind : Barry Lyndon, Amadeus, Lawrence of Arabia and Elephant Man. They are perfect and more importantly, timeless.Thank you Mr Kubrick for this magnificent oeuvre d'art !",10,3,5,30 August 2015
The Wolverine," Another total waste of Marvel universe
","Terrible movie, quite as bad as the latest 3 or 4 in the X-Men series. Seems that Superheroes movies have nothing to say anymore. Apart from the train scene which is quite decent, everything is lame in this movie.I read a review saying that the F. word was used only once to avoid the R rating. It's a shame that writers are trying to avoid that kind of mistake but are encouraged to make horrible scenes recalling WW2 in a very non historic manner which is unbearable to me Just to make things clear : there was certainly no POW camp in Nagasaki. Logan could't have known about Fat Boy just because he heard and saw a B52. Anyways, he couldn't event have seen the B52 ( there was only 1 to drop the bomb ) because if the plane launched the bomb from only a few thousand feet as in the movie, it would have been blown away immediately. Instead the B52 cruised above 30 thousand feet. The bomb did not explode when reaching the soil but about 3000 feet above ground. Furthermore, I doubt there were many Japanese soldiers that freed their American prisoners upon getting beaten so all of this is plain pointless.I know this is only to make a movie but to me this is very bad movie-making, and I'm not speaking about the rest of the movie which is even worse.I was a huge fan of Wolverine in the series debut in 2000 but now it seems that Mr Jackman is screened only to be seen growling around and looking bad-ass without a purpose.Stick to Bryan Singer's original X-Men which was an intelligent movie ( as well as bad-ass ), and X-Men 2 which was quite decent. The rest is rubbish !",3,1,5,8 November 2013
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Force Awakens, the fans go to sleep
","I wont babble too much on this review. The movie is visually stunning, but with almost 40 years of experience in special effects and a massive budget, could it be otherwise ? The score is way way less inspiring than the original ones which is a score you can listen to without watching the movies as it is one of the best movie scores ever written. The rest is totally unappealing... A was intrigued for a half hour, annoyed for another 30 minutes and then found myself waiting for the end to come as soon as possible as everything got really bad and tiring. I remember my reaction when seeing the prequels : we were all swept of our feet in contempt because seeing Star Wars come back to the screen was was we had waited for for about 2 decades. But as time passed and we saw these movies again we started to see everything that was wrong with them an now the consensus admits they are quite bad movies and they surely cannot come to grips with the original ones. I'm quite sure it will be the same with these ones, once the emotional effect gives way and people regain their senses. 3 out of ten for the visuals and the star wars universe, the rest is rubbish.",3,44,82,21 December 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Don't get addicted to gasoline because it will ruin your movie
","As per usual when a big blockbuster comes out, some hype part of its viewers scream this is the new ultimate masterpiece that is so good they don't understand why a new religion based on it shouldn't be started immediately.Do not get fooled : George Miller has only done what was needed to make his movie ultra popular and in this, he has succeeded. But as a movie in whole, he fails and delivers a quite lame production.I'm not a big fan of the original Mad Max series. The 1st had its moments, the Thunderdome was a failure, but The Road Warrior was an excellent movie. I watched it again some months ago to show it to my 18 year old daughter and was still amazed by the quality of its production, its story, its multi-dimensional characters and its outrageous violence in relation to the era it was released. Foremost, it had a feel of reality that made its post-apocalyptic world totally believable ( the canned dog food scene, the fight for gasoline, the bad guys, the vehicles, etc... ).Fury Road tries hard to revive this atmosphere... and fails.Where Mel Gibson ( and others ) delivered a complex character, chaotic and selfish, Tom Hardy delivers nothing at all, as for the other characters that have only a few lines in stock. Thus, as it has been much said by other reviewers, it's hard to connect with them and in the end, we don't care if they live or die.Where The Road Warrior provided a sense of reality in its everyday world, in Fury Road, the Gothic designs bring only stupidity and make things laughable ( in a world where everything is scarce, who would build a car with 2 decks one on top of the other, or who would be idiot enough to build a vehicle whose only purpose is to convey a mad metal guitarist and drummers ? ).In ANY world, who would be stupid enough to warn anybody that being addicted to water is dangerous ? Must we remind Fury Road's villain that without water, even the baddest guy would die in a matter of 36 hours max ? What is left of Fury Road is the usual blockbuster parade : action, explosions, more action and more explosions. In that, the movies achieves what it was aimed for : mindless violence for the masses.As for me, I got bored after the first 30 minutes and while I kept going, and despite a honorable realization and editing, I couldn't get back into the movie and waited for it to end as soon as possible.Conclusion : watch to be able to say you've seen it ( and then have enough matter at hand to criticize it ), but when it's time to watch it again, stick to the Road Warrior.",4,14,29,23 June 2015
