The Blair Witch Project," Loved it Loved It Loved It
","I have been going to movies an average of one movie per week for at least 10 years... I go (for the most part) for pure entertainment value.  I have seen my share of horror movies..  most lately make me laugh when I should be scared.This movie made me laugh when I was supposed to laugh... and scared the SH*T out of me when it was scary. Very well done.  Especially in the marketing... because going in to the movie thinking it was 'real' made the scary stuff even more believable. 
Go see it.... preferably with someone you can hold real tight.I am going again, and probably again....  and definitely buying it when in comes to video/dvd.",Null,1,1,3 August 1999
