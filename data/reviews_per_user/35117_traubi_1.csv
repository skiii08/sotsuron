Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," One of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen.
","I was a true Star Wars fan.  I have shelves full of toys.  I own the original movies.  I was so disappointed by the Phantom Menace that I very well might not see Episode II.  I tried as hard as I could to walk in with no expectations, but even no expectations were too many.  The movie was terrible.  I can't go too deep into my disappointment without spoiling the movie, but I felt that there were so many things in the plot that could have been handled in a way that was better for the movie and for the story overall.Unlike the powerful archetypes of episodes 4-6 we have shallow shells that drift about upon the whims of fate, blown here and there by accidental occurrences.  These accidental occurrences rob the movie of any dramatic value, leaving it as empty and pointless as most the characters. Visually, the movie was stunning, but that was about it.",1,1,3,30 November 1999
