Requiem for a Dream," See it and judge for yourself
","I've read all the reviews of this movie and I understand them all, having already seen the movie myself.  I'm one of the viewers who left the movie in a daze and couldn't sleep properly for almost a week afterwards.  There were moments in the movie that were a little over-the-top, but if this film gets its hooks in you, you'll be so glad you took the trouble to see it, despite how disturbed it may make you.  All the acting is first-rate, especially the women -- it opened my eyes to just how much Connelly and Burstyn add to their movies.",10,0,1,22 February 2002
