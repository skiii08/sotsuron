Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," False Advertising: Not About Political Incorrectness At All
","Sadly, this movie is not about political incorrectness because whatever humor it attempts to generate is at the expense of the unprotected classes  Christians, Jews, Whites, Republicans, etc. The protected classes that do appear  e.g., Blacks and Gays  remain untouched. Aside from that, there is nothing here that is even remotely clever or amusing. It is about a boorish comedian doing his best to get a reaction from supposedly unsuspecting 'normal' folks with his bathroom humor and childish antics. I use the word 'supposedly' because there are plenty of clues to suggest at least half of his victims know the script, and are probably actors. They play along a little too well (including Pamela).I certainly have no problem with the segment in the Christian church, showing those 'true believers' for the brainwashed idiots that they are. But I got no laughs from it ... only concern for the future of our nation.At best, this is a poorly done SNL skit ... and certainly not worth the cost of a theater admission, in my opinion.",1,22,47,13 November 2006
Ocean's Eleven," Third rate acting in a fourth rate script.
","This is the perfect example of a film with nothing more going for it than a big-name cast. That cast apparently chose to wing it rather than study their lines, and it shows. To a person, it is third rate acting.
The plot is so ridiculous as to be laughable. The holes in the story line and the action are numerous and frustrating.By the mid-point of the film, you must decide whether to ignore the problems and just let it happen, or pull the plug. I stuck with it, but without any satisfaction. It was a real disappointment!",4,4,7,23 December 2002
