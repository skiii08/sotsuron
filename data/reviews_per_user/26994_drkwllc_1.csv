Skyfall," One of the best Bond films to date !!!!!!!!!!
",Well I'm a Bond fan from Dr No to even Q.O.S I've even read the books which gives me reason to give this film 10/10 for storyline and for not going over the top on the action stakes which we now expect from these films nowadays. The cast were great with the new Q and a twist to Moneypenny giving her more than just wanting to get into bonds pants every time he walks through the door .The plot is a bit old but very good.I wont say any more you just need to open your minds forget about the gadgets and full on action and madman trying to take over the world with there over the top Ikea secret bases and watch a gritty film,10,4,13,10 November 2012
