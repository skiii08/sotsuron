Alien 3," not as good as alien or aliens but sure as hell a lot better than resurrection
","Unlike most people, i enjoyed this film. Sure it didn't have those same characters you could relate to but that was the point. This was a dark gritty movie and was intended to be that way. I am happy for the way Newt and Hicks died. I thought Aliens left us with a hope that should no have been there in the Aliens franchise. Right from the first movie to the second I could tell that Ripley would be fighting these things to her dying breath. And that is why I found the ending the greatest part of the entire series! It gave us a conclusion that ended Ripley's journey and I thought in a good way; sacrificing herself to stop the aliens. I agree, this movie does not TOUCH the greatness of Alien or Aliens, and nothing ever will. Not even the supposed Prequel in the works that is to be directed by Ridley Scott himself. But in all fairness, this movie BLOWS AWAY the pile of garbage that is Resurrection. The characters in this film, although not the kind you could relate to, were believable. They really seemed like the types of people they were portraying. Resurrections characters were not only ones you couldn't relate to but weren't even believable and they were just action movie clich√©s. So yeah, not as good as the first or second But hell of a lot better than resurrection. Alien 3 will forever be my favorite ending to a series of movies, considering i will not accept Resurrection as a legit movie in the Alien series. I will leave you with one quote that rightfully fits this movie and series. It is better to burn out than fade away.",9,2,54,24 October 2008
Alien: Resurrection," what?
","I was to young to watch any of these movies when they came out. I have only seen them now at the age of 13. Even at my age I say it's a bad movie. ALIEN3 was a perfect way to end the series but FOX just had to make another. I wasn't scarred once by this movie and that is what really killed it for me, there are even scenes in ALIENS that made me scarred but this one was just horrid. The Queen alien was not justified like in ALIENS. They added a gross 'new born' alien which was unique yet wasn't a great idea. The fact that they brought Ripley back was a horrible idea. They killed her but they JUST HAD to bring her back. Lets see a raise of hands for how many think that was for the money...okay. Although the visual effects were astounding, everything else sucked. What really killed my enjoyment was the fact that the aliens were brought out into the light for the majority of the scenes that they were in. The only thing that forced me to put 4/10 was the visuals. Everything out sucked",1,0,4,16 April 2008
Cloverfield," Cloverfield was good
","Well, I admit, I expected to come out nauseous after this movie. Amazingly, I didn't. I thought it was perfect. Much different then what you expect. A lot of people were angry that there was no story behind the monster, well what do you expect, it is done with a hand held camera in first person, your average New Yorker won't know what's happening. A lot of people were angry at the fact that you didn't get to see the movie that much, well what do you want the camera man to do, turn around and get trampled by the monster trying to get a good shot of it? I wouldn't. The monster, even with the little screen time, was brilliant in design, the monsters it dropped were really cool, the way people would explode if they got bitten was really cool. Above all, this movie was unique and very well made. So why do i give this a 7/10 instead of 10/10, well (oh no, bad news!) Why would the group go to save a girl that across town were the monster is (I would run away).When they find the girl, she has a steel bar through her, she should have been dead of blood loss. When the monster hits the helicopter it crashes, no one should have survived that crash. Why would the monster only nibble on the camera man instead of eating him whole? To finish this off, a lot of people were disappointed with the ending, But like the the monster's origin, how would a camera capture the monster dying (if it does) if a bridge just collapsed on it? Well, I liked the movie, others may, others may not but I liked it.",7,1,4,20 January 2008
