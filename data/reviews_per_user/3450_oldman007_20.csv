Iron Man 3," It does bring a new style to the comic book movies..but there are so many noticeable plot holes.
","This movie had a lot of excitement going for it. And I can see why, but it did miss the mark in some places.When Tony Stark/ Iron man (Robert Downey JR) is threatened by a terrorist by the name of Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), Tony must face him. It is Iron Man's best fight and challenge yet! However, the new suit...it was too CGI. And it was so bright. It was too bright to even look at. The rest of the CGI was fine, though! What is actually quite new is that we actually get to see Tony Stark fight without his suit on many times! While I wanted to see more of him inside the suit, I loved the fact that we get to see him fight without it on, which is quite impressive. We also get to see Pepper (Gwenyth Paltrow) fight a few times, which is also quite impressive.We also get to meet nice new characters along the way. And they are all fitted in quite nicely.However, there are so many mistakes and plot holes that it's too noticeable and laughable. I wont give them all away, for most of them are spoilers, but let's just say, people made out of fire, and their t-shirts and pants don't burn. You will notice them as you watch the movie.But apart from that, it's a new (original) comic book movie and is definitely worth seeing. 7/10 By the way, the twist was great! You'll see. :)",7,2,16,23 April 2013
Iron Man 2," Much better than the first and just downright entertaining!
","This movie will definitely be one of the best movies (if not the best) I see in 2010. Robert Downey JR returns to do Tony Stark, better and funnier than ever! Tony Stark is enjoying life as himself and as being the famous Iron Man. A huge threat comes to his attention. A man with whips is trying to kill him! With the help of Don Cheadle as War Machine, the two of them try to bring a man who calls himself Whip Lash to justice! Mickey Rourke plays the part very well! It just goes to show you've never too old to be a badass villain! Scarlet Johanson plays a very hot, but very suspicious lady! The rest of the cast are good as well.My only complaint is the middle half of the movie goes abit too slow and drags on abit. I wont reveal why, but you will see what I mean when you watch it. And Iron Man does reveal how he goes to the bathroom while wearing the Iron Man suit! I'd give this movie a 9/10.",9,7,20,30 April 2010
Finding Nemo," AMAZING!!!!!!!
","This movie is absolutely amazing,the way they displayed the opera house and the sydney harbour bridge is amazing,Dude.I rate this movie 9/10 because it did have a few slow bits in the movie.But apart from that it was brilliant.",10,0,1,22 October 2003
Orphan," One of the best Thriller movies i've seen in ages! In fact probably the best!
","I saw the trailer for 'Orphan' a while back. I remember thinking it would just be another decent Thriller/Horror movie, but, boy, was I wrong! The actress who plays Esther, Isabelle Fuhrman, is so talented! Finally, a kid who knows how to act! She was so good and talented and spooky! All the acting was good, all round! It's the story of a Mother and a Father who decide to finally adopt a child. They already have children of their own, but they decide to want to adopt. So they came out of the Orphange with a girl called Esther. Cute girl, well mannered, but little do they know there's something very wrong with her. For example, injuring school bullies, threatening to kill people etc. The direction was great and the story builds itself nicely into a nice unexpected twist.Great thriller movie and i recommend it to anyone who likes this sort of thing! :)",10,5,11,22 August 2009
Insomnia," Very Insomnia!
","I can't believe I never found out about this movie. I watched it just recently. Al Pacino and Robin Williams were great! I never thought Robin Williams could do serious work. He was very serious in this one. He was also very serious in the movie The Final Cut. This story is about a Cop from Los Angeles traveling to Alaska in regards to a murder of a 17 year old girl who had been brutally bashed to death. What Pacino didn't know was that the sun never goes down in Alaska in Winter. It effects his sleeping patterns and gets dizzy every day. Pacino then bumps into a dark mysterious writer named Walter Finch. Everyone thinks he's the murderer. But is he? You'll have to watch the film to find out. The director Christopher Nolan did a great job at keeping the camera still. It never moved or bounced up and down once. he always kept it straight and still. Great action, acting and directing. I give this movie a solid, but funky 10/10.",10,1,1,27 June 2007
The Hills Have Eyes," This movie is for Horror fans (like me) and no one else.
","When I was sitting in my seat at the theater with my mom I was almost expected to be disappointed. As soon as the movie started I knew I was totally wrong. The movie never gets boring and it just keeps moving. The direction was very well done and the pacing is terrific. I saw a lot of mixed reviews on this movie and everyone was saying how awful it was. I can't really see how awful it is. The mutants really freaked me out. One of the mutants looked just like Jason Voorhees except without the mask. It takes a lot to make characters freak and spook and this movie did just that. The movie is very violent too, but with a hint of cool. The fight scenes with the mutants are great. Believe it or not, but this film has action in it even though it's not classified as action. I thought the action scenes were good too. I recommend it to any horror fan, if you're not a fan on horror stay away from it at all costs. 10/10",10,0,3,28 May 2006
She's the Man," Call me crazy, but I loved at just about every single joke. It just made me laugh. I was trying to hold it in, but couldn't help it.
","I wasn't really sure what to quite think of this movie. I found Amanda Byns pretty funny in 'The Amanda Show.' My mom used to watch it with me. There was a memorable line that she said that I haven't seem to have forgotten in years: 'This girl Amanda will come a long way in her acting.' And she was right, here she is now playing in popular DreamWorks Pictures movies acting. It got straight to the story. It didn't seem to waste time on the chit chat, the idea just seemed to be 'Get on with he story our audience is waiting.' The plot was excellent. I loved the acting (especially from Amanda Bynes). David Cross was funny (as usual). I've always found him to be funny. He had about 20 lines or so, but boy he's funny. The laughs just keep coming. I'm not sure whether to call them childish, offensive, mature or cheesy, but I don't care, I was laughing so hard. I'm sure you will too. It was a full theater where i was and everyone seemed to be loving it. The direction is good too. I recommend to anyone who' a fan on Amanda Bynes or David Cross or perhaps even Vinnie Jones or any actor/actress. 10/10",10,1,2,6 May 2006
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," So predictable, with bad (electricity) effects, but had some good scenes.
","We start off with the scene we all know and love, Spider-Man fighting criminals. It does not take long for the action to start. Problem for me is, it just did not appeal to me. Surprisingly a good cameo as Paul Giamitti as the first main criminal.As far as character development goes, it did quite well. Parker and harry Osbourne met for the first time in years. They become quite close and start developing the friendship once more. Little does Parker know that Harry is dying from his Father's DNA an he needs Spider-Man's blood in order to survive. Parker/Spider-Man refuses to do so, as it might have a bad effect. So Harry has other ways of getting to stay alive. I will let you figure out where it goes from there.We have Jamie Foxx playing Electro. Jamie Foxx, I must admit, did not do a bad job at playing Electro/Max. However, he did not do the best. His electricity effects were so fake, it looked photo shopped. The fight scenes were okay. But, for those wandering about the green Goblin. He was only in it for about 4 and a half minutes with a 3 minute fight scene. Yes, I timed it! The death of Gwen (Emma Stone) was really unexpected, but necessary. It was a very emotional moment.Overall, I give this movie a 5/10. Way better than the first one, but could have been so much more!",5,25,54,19 April 2014
Transformers," Wow! What a great 'transformation' ride!
",I just went to go and see this movie today. From the second it started it was action packed! There was over 70 minutes of nonstop action. I never really got into the TV series. Seeing it live action was much better in my opinion. Every corner had something to laugh at too. The black guy that owned the car store was hilarious. As was Anthony Anderson! Every single black person in this movie was hilarious! Except for the Military guy. He was serious. But this film had great action and great laughs. This is one of the most funnest action films i've ever been too! Don't believe the haters. It's a very fun action film! I'm definitely going to get this on DVD when it comes out! I give this movie a 9/10!,9,0,7,28 June 2007
Paranormal Activity," This movie should have been a cult film, not a movie where it distorts people's views on hype.
","I personally thought this movie was quite chilling, not a 'jump out of your seat scary' but a 'I cant' move and have goosebumps' sort of movie.The movie does get the idea from 'The Blair Witch Project', all the hand held stuff, but TBWP missed the mark big time. What this movie had was really original and scary. Some sort of spirit (possibly demon) that moves things. AND HOW DO WE KNOW THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN WHEN YOU SLEEP?! The daytime scenes needed better dialog, but them arguing and not getting along was the point of this movie. Because them arguing and not getting along was making this SPIRIT Happy and making it hungry to kill them. The acting could've been better, but the nighttime scenes were pure genius! Had me chilling on the edge of my seat! But the hype ruined it fore a lot of people, (not for me), but a lot of people. It needed to be a film where it had a cult following (same With Napoleon Dynamite).But I give this movie a 7/10.Very original and has me thinking about the creaking noises sometimes in my room.",7,1,2,21 December 2009
The Dark Knight," The best Movie i've seen this year so far!
","I'm from Sydney, Australia. I have always been a big Batman fan. I had always planned to see this movie. I have to say this movie was a masterpiece! All the acting was great! Especially from Heath Ledger! The script was well written. It was very well directed. Action packed! The pacing was just fine. There wasn't too much talking and it never got boring. The theater was packed as were the following hours. I wont give anything much away, but I will say that Scarecrow and even Two-Face were in this movie! And, yes, there are fight scenes with them in it. I give this movie a good 11/10.This was Heath Ledger's last movie! It was a fantastic role by Ledger. His character and acting is very unforgettable. THE Oscar WILL BE YOURS IN 2009, LEDGER! May his soul R.I.P.",10,5,11,16 July 2008
Avatar," The future of CGI! But it ain't the future of pacing.
",I am a huge fan of James Cameron. I love all of his movies that he's directed....even this one. This movie was truly amazing. Truly! But it did have some slow scenes and sometimes I felt it was 40-50 mins too long.The story was well told...it was very different. Trying to keep it where it very real and not trying to make it so over the top where the audience just goes 'That is not the future at all.' This could happen in hundreds of years from now. Very believable stuff.The acting was fantastic. Even Michelle Rodriguize was fantastic! Every character served a purpose. No one ever felt pointless or left out. What I also liked about the movie is that even the action scenes (including fight scenes) were never overdone and it didn't try too hard to make it so action packed. Everything was just perfect...again...except the pacing.Excluding the slow pacing....this movie was fantastic. Fantastic last fight scene too! This movie is pure imagination! I hope it at least wins one Oscar. It should be nominated for 12 Oscars lol.8/10,10,7,10,27 December 2009
Reservoir Dogs," An instant classic. one of the most important films ever made.
","This movie was very well made. Let me start off by saying that I'm not a fan on Quentin Tarintino. I can't stand his work. I thought Reservoir Dogs would be the same, but I was wrong. Just by judging the way the cover was, it looked like a gangster movie where they spend the whole movie in the bank, but it isn't. It's about the perfect robbery that gets organised and it goes terribly wrong. They then realise one of them is a cop, but which one, is it? It was quite a change to actually have a relationship with gangsters for once. It was good to know that gangsters are human too. In an evil way, but they are still human. Most people say 'They're gangsters, they're not human.' But it's not true. They are human. Quentin Tarintino makes them human. It explains their backgrounds and how they got their job, etc. It had great 70's songs too such as 'Stuck in the middle With You' by Steeler's Wheel. The cast is fantastic. They do act childish in their situation, but who wouldn't? All he characters in this are so lovable. This film is very important because it's exactly what gangsters do and i'm 99% certain it's what they talk about. It's just good to have a relationship with bad guys for a change instead of the good guys all the time. I recommend it to Quentin tarintino lovers and people who love gangster films. 10/10 Advice: A lot of people hate reservoir Dogs, which is fine, but don't get mad. Don't say something like 'You just didn't get it and you're not adult', it's the fact that they don't like it.Respect their opinion. You can't make everyone love the same movie. The world would be boring.Oh, and another thing, just so the people who haven't seen this, there's no action in this movie, it's all about the dialog.",10,2,5,6 May 2006
Zombieland," Extremely funny, but it does fall flat at times.
","There are loads of Zombie films these days and very few of them (in my opinion) are funny or good. I have to say this movie was both hilarious and disgusting! My theater was packed and everyone of them was cracking up all the way through it! What was really clever about the movie was that all of these 4 characters are all in their way either dumb or just plain cruel or stupid, and yet, they are the only survivors left in the whole world! That's what I really love about it.It did have some slow points where it got too dramatic and went without laughs for at least a good 20 minutes or so, but excluding that..it's perfect.Very disgusting, sick and twisted and hilarious movie! If you hate this movie you must be a zombie! Rule Number #1. See this movie!",8,2,5,21 December 2009
Jersey Boys," An acceptable movie, but it needed a lot of work to be done.
","The last scene of 'Jersey Boys' is a curtain call of sorts. Set to The Four Seasons' memorable ode to deflowering, 'December, 1963,' the scene explodes with bright, noisy colors and jubilant voices. It hops from character to character, visually name-checking the entire cast as they sing and dance. The camera-work, editing and lighting foster a genuine sense of excitement. In this finale, 'Jersey Boys' feels like the Broadway musical upon which it is based, showcasing the energy and joy that continues to leap off the stage every night in venues from Las Vegas to London.If only director Clint Eastwood had directed more scenes like this. He ensured his cast would be up to the task by importing several veterans from the stage. Three of the Four Seasons cast in 'Jersey Boys' are from various incarnations of the show, including Tony-winner John Lloyd Young, whose Frankie Valli is vocally spot-on and a force to behold. Christopher Walken, no slouch to musicals, is also on hand, doing a bit of a soft-shoe in the aforementioned finale. His performance definitely is very worthy out of all the actors involved. Even 'Boardwalk Empire' vet Vincent Piazza, as group member Tommy DeVito, holds his own with the more musically seasoned members of The Four Seasons.The singing talent is there, but Eastwood and writers Marshall Brickman ('Annie Hall') and Rick Elise opt for a more realistic depiction of events. They transform 'Jersey Boys' from jukebox musical to movie biopic, exchanging one much-maligned genre for another. In the process, the focus is shifted; the drama is played up and the music seems shoehorned in where convenient.This imbalance is forgivable in scenes where the band deals with talent scout Joe Pesci (yes, that Joe Pesci, here in the guise of actor Joey Russo) or interact with one another. The problems arise in the mob-related material, which is seemingly endless. These plot elements are necessary to tell the full story, but the lazy way they are depicted stops the movie cold. We've already seen 'GoodFellas,' 'Mean Streets' and any number of mob-related tales, so Eastwood's take on them feels lifeless. As the catalyst for most of these scenes, Piazza wrings his derivative character for all that he's worth. But Walken, as mob boss Gyp DeCarlo, is given little to do besides commit scene-stealing grand larceny in a weepy moment opposite Young's Valli.'Jersey Boys' keeps the show's conceit of having each of the Four Seasons tell various aspects of the story. Tommy, Frankie, Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda) and Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen) break the fourth wall at various points to talk to us directly. Since Tommy is both the band's heart and its downfall, he figures into everyone's narrative. Songwriter Gaudio becomes the band's primary songwriter because Tommy acted on a tip from Joe Pesci. Frankie sharpens and perfects his famous falsetto with Tommy's help. And Nick rooms with Tommy for 10 years and sees the worst sides of him.Whether they're singing or fighting, 'Jersey Boys' is at its best when it focuses on the band members' chemistry. The actors know their characters' voices well enough to effortlessly plow through as many Four Seasons songs as the original musical contains. They sound spectacular, and there's enough of each song to satiate fans and newbies alike. But Eastwood shoots so many of these numbers in a matter-of-fact, almost documentary style, static way that the two times he really cuts loose are the film's best moments. The second time is the curtain call finale; the first is Young's hauntingly emotional rendering of 'Can't Take My Eyes Off You.' If you know the song, you'll know what the big mid-number reveal is. Eastwood presents it with stunning gusto, and the reaction Valli gets at the end is as close to a stand-up-and-cheer moment as 'Jersey Boys' gets.Though no longer playing to the back of the house, Young, Bergen and Lomenda still have a tendency to go big in front of the camera. It's most noticeable opposite Piazza's Tommy, who despite his stereotype-ridden role gives the best performance in 'Jersey Boys.' Yet the vocal talent trumps any minor performance issues incurred. The filmmakers made the right decisions for the leads. This movie will sell many soundtracks.The elephant in the room is Eastwood himself. He is the wrong director for this material, and this opinion comes from someone who loved 'Million Dollar Baby,' 'Space Cowboys' and even those orangutan movies. He is the wrong choice, but not for the reason you think. Eastwood is adept at handling music in films, from 'Bird' to his country music homage to Garbo's 'Camille,' 'Honkytonk Man' (which I also like without shame). But, for once, I have to agree with those who say his style is too laid back. A movie as grungy, profane and blue-collar as 'Jersey Boys' needs to feel more alive. When the music's not playing, 'Jersey Boys' starts to lull you into mild lethargy. I wonder what fellow Jersey Boy Brian De Palma could have done with this.",6,2,5,20 July 2014
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The end is here. A great way to end Star Wars.
","I must say after seeing this movie, i was quite stunned! I never went to see 'Star Wars: The Phantom Menace' or 'Star Wars: Attack of the clones' in theaters. I'm glad to. The 2 prequels were just so dumb and very boring. It goes to show ya that those two movies were nothing but warm-ups just to get 'Star Wars: Revenge of the sith' story running. I think the whole world will agree with me that 'Revenge of the sith' is better than the other 2 prequels. Heck, even IMDb says so. Jar Jar Binks does not say 1 word in this movie...THANK GOD! Hate the character. He really gets on my nerves.This movie has a plot, a good one at that. Whilist the other 2 prequels didn't even have one. This movie did. It caught up on a lot of things from the originals. And it was good to see some evil for a change. Instead of having 'A new hope' as for Luke as the last hope for been the last Jedi, we have Anakin been the last hope for been the last Sith. It was very dark. Which is good, actually. That way not many kids can see this movie. So you wont have many kids running around in the movie pretending that they're in a concert playground. But you still get stupid teenagers acting stupid in the theater. But, anyway. This movie is the best movie i've seen in cinemas, same with 'Seed of Chucky.' But 'Revenge of the sith' is definitely a movie to be seen in the cinemas. The action and CGI in this movie is simply amazing. Best movie so far with it. And the acting improved 100% ever since the other 2 prequels. If you're a fan on action and Science Fiction, than this is YOUR movie. I recommend this to all the Star Wars fans and all the people that love action and Science Fiction.",10,8,17,5 July 2005
Sherlock Holmes," Robert Downey JR was fantastic in this movie! The Rest was mediocre.
","I honestly don't know what to say. The story was decent, Jude Law was alright, Rachel Mcadams was alright. Everything about this movie was so decent.The story, I thought was predictable, but it was still pretty fun. The direction was pretty good, I guess. The pacing was okay too. An okay fight scene near the end. Everything about this movie was decent...except for Robert Downey JR. His performance was incredible! He'l;l definitely either win an Oscar or a Golden Globe.I'd recommend it to huge fans of Robert Downey JR and Jude Law and Rachel Mcadams.7/10",7,0,2,27 December 2009
Casino Royale," A great action ride!
","I saw this movie and wow...this movie had nonstop action. I've never really been a big fan of the James Bond. They're all pretty good, but a lot of them have too much you know what scenes. This one had 1 scene and 1 minute of it and more action. Daniel Craig has to be one of the best James Bonds. That guy was very good. All the acting was good too. But all of this movie action. That African guy at the beginning was fantastic! He was like a monkey. For a PG-13 movie this movie had a lot of brutal scenes. The torture scene was very disturbing. This movie is for anyone who likes action. The Best Bond Movie so far! Look forward to the DVD! Look forward to seeing it!",10,1,4,13 January 2007
The Cabin in the Woods," I loved it, but I can totally understand why people would walk out of the theater and find it terrible.
","I'm a big Horror Fan. I have been since I was a young child. I've never seen anything like this movie before. It's a combination of everything. It's taken everything from every other Horror Movie and thrown it all into this movie. But what is really impressive is the fact that the movie has it's own (original) plot.What people seem to get confused about is that this is also a comedy. If you haven't laughed within the first 10 mins, then you better walk out right now, because the movie is exactly the same all through out. I was laughing all the way through it. This movie is just bizarre. One of the most bizarre Horror/Comedies i've ever watched in my life, is fact, the most bizarre Horror/Comedy i've watched in my life.Don't be expecting any scary scenes or anything suspenseful, because this is the wrong movie for you.The acting was great, well written, well directed and excellent comedy one-liners and with the best twist i've ever seen! This movie is exactly where it needs to be, it's a cult movie. It's 'EXACTLY' what it should be. I'm part of the cult following! A cult classic and the best movie i've seen of 2012! If you are a Horror (over the top violence) mixed in with comedy fan, I 110% recommend this one! 10/10",10,391,671,8 August 2012
The Simpsons Movie," Oh my damn!
","This movie was so dang funny. It's definitely better than the new episodes, that's for sure. The story is about Homer dumping his new pet's poo into the river and the town goes crazy over it. The government traps them in Springfield and wont let them escape because their pollution is bad. They must find a way to save Springfield. There were a lot of sexual references and drug scenes in this movie. My theater were crazy about it too. This kids sitting next to me was laughing so hard he kept laughing on my arm lol. I tried to back away, but if I backed away too much i'd be leaning against an old fat man sitting to me. Too much info there lol. But The Simpsons Movie is a great hilarious fun ride if you're fan of the series. Even if you're not people still tend to enjoy it. Eighteen years and here it is! It was all worth it! I can't wait to get it on DVD!",10,3,10,28 July 2007
