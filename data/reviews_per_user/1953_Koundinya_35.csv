The King's Speech," Powerful in every essence
","Winner, Best Picture, 2011.The movie is packed with brilliant performances by Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush and an impressive performance by Helen Bonham Carter combined with Tom Hooper's diligent direction and mellifluous music. The humor is timely and sensible and the language spoken and storyline fairly simple.I was quite sure of watching 'The King's Speech' claim the Best Picture Oscar at the Academy Award presentations, 2011. The very first scene in the movie established this impression the first time i watched the movie. The movie begins with a euphonious background score as the radio announcer rinses his mouth before the broadcast and the whole stadium awaits the arrival of the Duke to deliver the speech that concludes the exhibition.Duke George stammers and if one asked him he'd reply 'I bloody well stammer'. He consults several speech therapists who try their antiquated methods on him for no use. Upon reference, the duchess visits Lionel incognito. She is forced to reveal her identity when Lionel refuses the conditions laid by her. George drops by and Lionel analyzes his condition and judges his stammering was curable and temporary. A reluctant George rubbishes Lionel's method and walks away.One night, he listens to the recording of his voice and is stunned by his flawless pronunciation of words. He visits Lionel again and with proper advice and guidance George gains the confidence to start giving a few speeches in public and his speech tends to improve with time.After he is crowned King after his brother refuses to take up the throne, the world is at the brink of another world war. As a king, it's his duty to deliver a speech for his countrymen not to fear and cower at the inevitable but face it. He rehearses the speech with Lionel and delivers the speech which receives thunderous applause from his countrymen and the King and Lionel continue to be friends for the rest of their lives.",10,0,1,19 June 2012
Moneyball," A docudrama of the most spectacular streak in the history of the sport
","I was quite sure of witnessing a sweep in this year's Oscars but didn't anticipate such a snub for a stupendous film on Sports. The Editing, the Sound Mixing deserve Oscars.Billy Beane is a baseball player-turned-general manager. He is cool-headed and cares for none, not even his players. He is the general manager of a team that trades out the men who performed the best and is left with a new selections to make with the paltry sum of money they have. He finds a really interesting person on his visit to the Tigers' office and hires him. They prepare a list of players who are well within their affordable range but with minor ailments, for which they are often ignored. They get into a heated argument with the scouts and coach over what they call a brazenly audacious move that could further slim down the chances of the team performing well. All the scouts leave the team and Billy is left with the coach, though reluctant to stay for another season, and Peter on his side.At first, the obvious happens. The team performs miserably. After a few games, Billy Beane changes his attitude towards his players, treats them well, exhorts and edifies them and even trades the ones who have been corrupting the others and the ones who haven't lived up to the expectations and all these bear fruit.They win one game after the other and the winning streak extends to a record 19 and a chance to re-write history beckons. They win the game, shatter the long-existing record and make it to the playoffs and falter once again. Billy is the subject of scathing remarks and is ridiculed for his adoption of an economics theory to draft players. He is offered the highest emolument by the owner of Red Sox but turns down the offer.To talk in terms of Baseball, the movie is a 4-run homer: 1- Sorkin's brilliant screenplay. 2- Brad Pitt's and Jonah Hill's acting. 3- Sound Mixing. 4- Film Editing.",9,0,1,17 June 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," 'Disappointed' is a modest word
","I must agree i was really awed by the art-direction and near-perfect costume design. It's really difficult to bring forth the life and culture that existed more than a century back.The movie failed to meet every single expectation set by its prequel. Sherlock Holmes, known for his wit and intelligence in deciphering codes, codes that could unfold a mystery, is presented as a polar opposite of his original-self in this movie.The Editing that forced all our jaws ajar in the prequel, has become nothing less than a bore. Too many plans of action makes the editing hackneyed. Hans Zimmer's reboot of the original tracks is the only bright facets of the movie, though the originals were comparatively better.Guy Ritchie raised our hopes of experiencing a near-Doyle world in which Sherlock rescues the yesteryear England from the hands of Moriarty in the first part. But he failed miserably to meet those expectations he set.Guy Ritchie is capable of reviving the Sherlock Doyle envisaged in his next part, if he ever plans to make it.",7,1,2,9 August 2012
Finding Neverland," One man who dreamt with his eyes wide open
","Yes. We all dream. We all have been to some fantasy land in our childhood and some of us even imagine themselves in some fantasy land even now. We seldom or never share our dreams with others for the obvious reason of being the cynosure of ridicule. But, there was one man who created a world he dreamed of to overcome his own lamenting tales as a boy, a world that brightened our childhood.Marc Forster has made a movie that brings to the viewers the life of the man who has been the biggest influence of a child born in any corner of this world for more than a century and the events and family that exhorted him to create the fantasy land of Neverland.Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet have given a really impressive performances and Depp in particular was denied the coveted Oscar more than Kate. The editing and the background score of the movie couldn't have been better.A movie worthy of the awards it was so harshly denied.",9,3,3,7 August 2012
The Great Dictator," The greatest satire on the most despised man ever
","A movie that even Adolf Hitler watched twice(probably to overcome the fact that they have uncanny resemblances and convince himself that it wasn't him who acted in the film).The movie was the first of the talking movies made by Charles Chaplin and it did not involve the character 'tramp'. The movie is a laughter riot like every Chaplin movie and his take on Adolf Hitler is very much tacit.I wonder how he has made the greatest mass murderer in the history of the world look like the greatest stand-up comedian ever. Such is the effort taken by the man who penned the script, directed the movie and acted in it.A masterpiece indeed.",10,3,5,21 June 2012
The Hustler," He hustles fast and loose
","Eddie Felson likes to play pool fast and loose. He challenges a long-time, undefeated champion Minnesota Fats for a game. As Eddie leads the game , he gets tipsy and lacks concentration on the game and loses all the money he made in the previous rounds. He's penniless after the game, loses his manager, goes on drinking bouts and falls for a woman. His performance plummets to the lowest ebb and he gets into an agreement with Minnesota Fats' manager, Bert Gordon, who sees great potential in making money from Eddie than an aging Fats. Gordon gets him games, helps him make a fortune, only to take a larger portion of the returns. Gordon tries to take advantage of Eddie's girlfriend and she commits suicide due to embarrassment. Eddie, determined to get himself emancipated from the clutches of Gordon beats Fats in a marathon; beats him over and over again until Fats declares the end of the game. Eddie refuses to pay up his hard-earned money to a bookie but Gordon threatens him and after heated arguments, Gordon orders Eddie not to play another game of pool if he wanted his limbs to be a part of his body and Eddie agrees and keeps the money.If there's someone who could play an inebriated man perfectly in every movie, it has to be Paul Newman. George C.Scott's performance was equally good. The movie was rightly awarded the Best art-direction and cinematography Oscars.",9,1,2,29 May 2012
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Classic espionage thriller that required more running time than well-known faces.
","The running time of the movie is roughly half to that of the TV series. It's running time demands many key subplots be cut short. Yet, the wonderful editing and screenplay make this is a must-watch espionage movie.The screenplay of the movie, I felt, was written on the assumption that the movie-goers would have watched the TV series as well. Many key sentences that should have been spoken are simply shown as perceived and understood by the other characters, which might be a little difficult for those who have neither watched the TV series nor read the book.Alberto Iglesias' soothing reboot of the soundtrack from the TV series is one of the facets that I liked in the movie.Gary Oldman hasn't outperformed Alec Guinness' performance as the cagey George Smiley but I'm sure no other actor in the present day would have come close to Gary Oldman's portrayal of Smiley, a performance that fetched him a long-awaited Academy award nomination.A movie that deserves the rave reviews that it received.",8,7,11,26 December 2012
Catch-22," Nichols disappoints. Arkin doesn't.
","I had many questions in mind when I watched this film, the first among them being, 'Why was this movie made?' and a few more questions followed- 'Didn't Mike Nichols read the script and suggest any revisions?' and 'Couldn't it be a little more funnier, may be not as much as the book but funny nonetheless?'.Adapted from Joseph Heller's one-of-the-kind satire novel, the movie failed to live up to the hype and humor the book created. Mike Nichols, fresh from winning an Academy Award for 'The Graduate' somehow lost his brilliant directing skills to a poorly written screenplay. Yes, there were jokes and funny moments, where you'd guffaw no matter what, but those moments were too few as compared to those in the book.MASH, the book, by any standards, couldn't match Joseph Heller's novel. But when it comes to Motion Picture and presenting it, Mike Nichols lost it to Robert Altman's MASH.And no one else would have made a better Yossarian than Alan Arkin. Jon Voight and Balsam were impressive too.",7,1,2,11 December 2012
The Best Years of Our Lives," A tribute to the victorious dead and the wounded, enervated, and venerated survivors
","A sailor and two soldiers return to their hometown; back from the war. They are revered by their fellowmen for fighting for their country. Al is promoted in the bank he worked with before the war. Fred returns to his house and realizes his wife had long vacated the house. Whatever happens to the lives of Al and Fred is of lesser importance when compared to the true life and pain of a handless soldier. Homer loses both his hands in the war and his perseverance and strong-soul get him going. His parents and neighbors pity him but he does all his daily chores by himself and demands he be treated the same way he was treated before the war. He gives humorous explanations when inquired about his condition and even tries to choke a man who feels war was a waste of incalculable time, money and countless lives.He has truly established courage in the minds of his fellow soldiers who have seen the horrors of battle and has given them a reason to live, for they have served the country. Harold has shown us that you don't need two hands when you have an iron heart. Salute!",9,1,1,16 June 2012
Battleship Potemkin," The greatest war movie ever-made and a landmark in film-making
","One of the greatest and the first movies of the genre War. The movie is an inspiration to film-makers from all corners of the world. The movie has graphic violence which is far ahead of its times. The movie is a landmark in cinematography too. The scattering of moonlight on sea water making the water gleam like crystals will be a scene that will leave every viewer awed. The Odessa Staircase sequence is unequivocally the best scenario in the film.The movie brings forth an account of the uprising on the Battleship Potemkin. The background score matches the situation and also defines the mood of the men in various scenarios.Sailors and workers are fed rotten meat and are ill-treated while the senior officers devour fresh meat. Vakulinchuk, a brave sailor, decides to act. They protest peacefully by choosing not to drink the soup. An exasperated captain decides to shoot down the ones 'who did not like their soup'. Just as the guards get ready to fire at the rebels, Vakulinchuk enlightens his fellow sailors that they're about to fire at their fellowmen and thus a mutiny arises. The sailors hunt and cast the senior officers off the ship while a frenzied officer fires his rifle at Vakulinchuk. The man who spearheaded the mutiny is dead.He's brought to the shore and the news of the mutiny goes viral. Men and women start congregating near the pyre and an uprising is imminent in Odessa. Men and women are aroused by the inflammatory speech of a few volunteers. They already celebrate victory and send the sailors aboard the Potemkin food supplies and gifts.Their celebrations are interrupted by the armed soldiers who fire at will. They spare none within the range of their rifles- not even kids. The sailors decide it's time for them to act. They bomb the Odessa Opera House. They decide to meet the opponents head on. Men on both the ships are ready to fire cannons at each other. But, they bring down their ordnances and unite as brothers.",10,1,1,19 June 2012
The Grapes of Wrath," The movie that takes every viewer back in time to the great depression
","I'm flummoxed as to which among the two is the better than the other- John Steinbeck's literature masterpiece or John Ford's motion picture masterpiece. A panache indeed.There hasn't been and will not be a better representation of the lives of the people at the time of The Great Depression than this piece of literature adapted as a movie. Only a genius can add life to the characters, make them walk, talk, cry and pray, and bring to the screen what pain and struggle in the throes of poverty really would be.Tom Joad is out from a penitentiary on a parole. He heads back home only to find no one there. With the help of a former priest who is an now an apostate, go to his uncle John's place just to catch his family members when there about to leave to California. They realize en route that the pamphlets regarding requirement of workers in orchards had been circulating for an awful long time and that the wages weren't as exaggerated as they were in the pamphlets. They lose their ailing grandfather and after the obsequies, they finally reach California. They find tens of thousands of immigrants and somehow manage to get employment and accommodation in an orchard. Meanwhile, Tom kills a man who opens fire on the former priest and kills him. Tom flees the place when all his family members except his mom are asleep. He promises his mom that he would return. The Joads leave the town the next morning to find a better place to habitat.Jane Darwell is the quintessential mother and matriarch of the Joads. She was rightly awarded the 'Best Actress in a Supporting Role' Oscar.",10,2,4,7 June 2012
Incendies," Transfixed!
","The movie has more twists than one could imagine, more revelations than one could anticipate, more places than one could retrace, more pain than one could endure, more people of disparate views than one could meet and more relationships than one could possibly 'swear'.Incendies is a modern day masterpiece that widens the gap between your lower and upper jaws as the film progresses. A movie that forces one to watch it twice or thrice to break-free from the web laid by the storyline; such a brilliant adaptation of a play.A movie that any movie magazine or movie buff would list as one of their Top 10 Foreign Language Films of all-time.",10,1,4,31 May 2012
North by Northwest," A timeless thriller which mixes romance with suspense in equal proportions.
","What makes this movie stand apart from the modern day thrillers- the story that leaves us bemused for more than an hour from the commencing of the movie, Hitchcock's direction and the wonderful camera work that by all means bolsters his way of presenting a story and not just telling a story, or is it a great actor who never caught up with age and exemplified a gentleman as a man in a tuxedo? I'd say, all of it.Just as you think the movie is headed in no particular direction, Hitchcock steers the swerving vehicle first towards North by train and then Northwest by flight.Anyone who has watched the film cannot simply remain silent about the fact that they witnessed the best typography ever, a work from the master of it, Saul Bass. And like every other Hitchcock's films, Bernard's soundtracks adds to the suspense in the story.",10,1,2,23 December 2012
American Beauty," Beautified lives of the beleaguered
","Winner, Best Picture, 2000.One movie that puts what an average American harps for everyday- need for affluence, need for plush upholstery, need for a new partner, need for a luxurious living and a steady flow of income, desire to look good, and need for narcotics.Sam Mendes has brought all the aforementioned through some stellar performances by the cast, especially by Kevin Spacey, who not only plays the beleaguered man but also narrates his life in backward mode up to the time of his death in a way that is quite touching and timely humor. And it's hard not only for the weak-hearted folks but for every viewer to try and not shed tears towards the end. Such is the movie- it makes you feel like you're a part of the movie and imbibe the movie.The euphonious background score, and the colorful cinematography are one of the other awesome facets of the movie.",10,0,1,14 June 2012
Judgment at Nuremberg," A star-studded cast with several stellar performances
","One of the few courtroom dramas that has a major portion of runtime in the courtroom.While Montgomery Clift and Burt Lancaster are deemed to be Method actors and have given one of the most powerful and emotional performances in their respective careers, Maximilian Schell steals the limelight with an other-worldly performance as a loud-speaking, neutral lawyer trying to prove the judges not guilty of the conviction on approving the process of sterilization and establishment of concentration camps in their stint as judges during the heyday of the Third Reich. While most of the convicted are partisans, Ernst Janning is a highly-educated and revered man who had no choice but to approve the bills as stated by the law and pleads 'Guilty' while the other men plead clemency. His case draws the attention of the tribunal and Judge Haywood, played by Spencer Tracy in particular.A movie packed with catharsis of people of Germany. Stanley Kramer's best.",9,0,2,31 May 2012
The Intouchables," A biography of a quadriplegic and his live-in caretaker.
","One of the best movies of the present day. The movie brings to the silver screen an unusual camaraderie between a wealthy man and his live-in caretaker. I simply love the way the movie begins with an ethereal background score and ends in a similar fashion; the background music is an integral part of the movie. The movie is a perfect mixture of everything you can expect in a good movie. Philippe and Driss share a bond over the years that is enviable. Driss is a responsible brother, a wonderful caretaker and a happy-go-lucky man who mixes humor with his quotidian. Never does he make Phillipe feel bad about his disability and is always there to cheer him up. The scene in which Driss tries different styles of beard on Phillipe is surely the best scene in the movie.We get to know at the end of the movie that the movie is based on a real-life story. The humor is sensible and timely, expletives are totally absent and the story is simple. The well-written script, the brilliant directing, the exemplary editing and a few powerful performances have made this movie a must-watch for all age groups.",10,1,2,15 May 2012
Lawrence of Arabia," 'He for whom nothing is written may write himself a clan'
","Perhaps one of the greatest movies of all-time- in the league of The Godfather, 12 Angry Men and Schindler's List- and definitely David Lean's best. The background music scored by Maurice Jarre added to the gravitas of making it one of the greatest films. The soundtracks are full of energy and kept resonating in my mind right from the time the movie commenced. Peter O'Toole portrayed T.E.Lawrence, a man often marred by controversy for his radical thinking and insouciance. T.E.Lawrence is shown as a man respected by his fellowmen after his contribution to the Arab league in the beginning of the movie and the movie shows his journey from Cairo to Aqaba and then to Damascus as a member of the British army. He's considered arrogant, extraordinary and sadistic by his colleagues but that doesn't stymie the aid, leadership in attacking the Turks and the invaluable counsel he provided the Arabs . The movie is a landmark in every single aspect right from the geographical location of filming. I still contemplate over how few scenes were shot, especially the one in which the Arabs blast a railway track and all the horses aboard are set free.It is one of the movies i sat and watched with inquisitiveness and enjoyed thoroughly, albeit many complain about the running time of the movie. The cinematography is a treat to sore eyes. There couldn't be a better movie in terms of being a complete amalgam of War, Adventure, Drama and History. And special appreciation to the make-up and costume crew who had made sure the Caucasian actors looked like real Arabs. This is a movie that is truly appreciated when watched than read about. Hats off to the men behind this Epic.",10,1,2,13 May 2012
No Man's Land," Tension in and out of the trench.
","Winner, Best Foreign Language Film, 2002.'I've never seen anything like it', says a Bosnian Officer. That is quite a concise summary of the movie. The archive footage, the brilliant script that balances humor with the fanatic attitude of soldiers and the tense and unpredictable ending, all make this movie a must-watch.Serbia has declared a war on Bosnia. Serbians are well-armed while Bosnia defends itself with armed civilians and police force. Cities are razed. Men are killed in the battle. Serbians call it 'Ethical Cleansing'.A Bosnian relief squad set out to the enemy lines in the night and wait for the fog to lift up. Dawn arrives and by the time they are awake from their slumber, they are ambushed by the Serbian army. However, two soldiers survive. One is assumed to be dead by the other. The other survivor, Ciki, shot in the chest, rests at a makeshift house. Two men from the Serbian army are sent to check the field and Ciki kills one of them and injures the other.The man from the Serbian army, Nino and Ciki have different perspectives of war and have verbal duels over the causes and atrocities of war. They make sure the other survivor, resting on a bouncing landmine, is given due medical aid. They chat up with each other but very soon get back to their fanatic-selves and try to kill each other.UNPROFOR steps in the scene to help them but due to orders they pull back and wait for further orders. Media intervention and live coverage of the situation revs up the rescue operation. Ciki and Nino kill each other and the movie ends with Cera still lying on the undefusable mine.",8,1,4,9 January 2013
Lincoln," Daniel's best, any 'Day'.
","'Lincoln' is not a movie for those who don't have an ear for grandiloquence. It is not a movie for those who expect it to be an action-packed Biography. It is not a movie for those who aren't fond of parables. Then what is it? It's a melange of method-acting at its best, ultra-natural ambiance of a war-torn nation and a brilliant script that throws light on the personal and tactical life of the most revered and pragmatic President in the history of the United States.It's the fourth year of civil war. The Union clearly has an edge over the Confederates. Lincoln has been re-elected as the President. He wants the thirteen amendment, which proclaims emancipation, be passed by the House. Every single white man in the country opposes the amendment for it might nullify the bigotry for the colored folk, but still support the amendment for their respect in Lincoln. Lincoln wants the amendment to be passed before the war gets over and against the advice of his very loyal subordinates; he sets a deadline for the amendment to be passed. The movie then takes you through the devious tactics of Lincoln; how he painstakingly ensures that he doesn't have any 'traitors' on his side ;how he, as a bereaved father, opposes his elder son's wish to enlist; how he ensured the amendment received bipartisan support . A man with a gift of gab, Stevens serves as Lincoln's right-hand man in the house and has worked for the abolition of slavery throughout his life, for personal reasons as well. Lincoln's men ensure they gather the support required for the amendment to be passed and succeed. Later on, Lincoln is assassinated, though the assassination is not shown in the movie.Daniel Day-Lewis, barring his uncanny resemblance to Lincoln, has given life to the most respected in American history and it's a performance that is worthy of nothing less than an Academy award. Tommy Lee Jones and all the other Lincoln's men played their respective parts brilliantly, and Sally Field was a tad melodramatic. It may not be Spielberg's best, but it is one movie that has several powerful performances by one of the Hollywood's finest.",9,3,6,1 January 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," A truly under-rated adaptation.
","I felt like writing about the movie after watching David Fincher's remake of the movie, which i felt was totally pointless and was no way better than the Swedish original. Lisbeth Salander, played by Noomi Rapace, is a computer hacker who draws a few 'raised eyebrows' with her sartorial and tonsorial preferences. She's consigned to a sex-starved businessman after the death of her mother. The man who is supposed to take care of her, takes advantage of her for she's dependent on him for allowances and uses her to satisfy his sexual pleasures. Mikael, a financial journalist buried in a scandal, is hired by wealthy patriarch Harriet Vanger to solve the case of his missing daughter. Lisbeth helps Mikael find out every single detail pertaining to the events before and after the missing of Mr.Vanger's beloved daughter. They finally crack the case. Lisbeth helps Mikael prove his innocence; he is found 'not guilty' of the conviction. Lisbeth uses her expertise in hacking to rake in billions of Swedish kronas and flees the country disguised as a blonde.It is one of the best thriller movies of the modern day with a totally unpredictable plot. Noomi Rapace's performance will perhaps remain the best performance by an actress in a leading role in a foreign language film for a long time. The editing of the movie couldn't have been better, quite exquisite. A well-made thriller.",8,1,2,13 May 2012
Ip Man," A biography of a lesser-known pedagogue of a greater-known prodigy, Bruce Lee.
","I am not a fan of the action movies on martial arts made in the Far East. Neither am i derisive of the genre. This movie is verily the one that amazed me.It is one of the umpteen movies that has a storyline based on the ancient art of martial arts and yet has a simple plot based on real events.The movie portrays the life of Yip Man, the pioneer of the Chinese martial art of Wing Chun. The movie does have a fair amount of jaw-dropping fight scenes in which the opponents, whatever be their number, are annihilated by a noncommittal, deft moving, ambidextrous Yip Man. He salvages the pride of Fo Shan when the local patriarchs are defeated by outsiders. Yip Man lives a disciplined life in affluence until the Japanese invade China. He 'fights' for survival and carries on his good deeds despite the struggle. He later proves to the Japanese that Wing Chun, which is Confucian in spirit is far better than the Japanese Kung Fu. The movie also has a wonderful background score by Kenji Kawai.A movie worth the time.",7,0,0,6 June 2012
2001: A Space Odyssey," It's 2012 and only 12 men have walked on the moon!
","I must confess i couldn't understand the movie the first time i watched it except for the hegemony of one group of monkeys equipped with bones of dead animals over the other. So i decided to read the book written by Arthur C.Clarke and watch the movie again. The movie is far ahead of its time. Arthur C.Clarke envisaged a space mission to Jupiter and settlements on Moon when man hadn't even landed on moon in reality(Neil Armstrong landed a year later). I clearly understood what the story was and was awed by his imagination and foresight. Kubrick has taken the standards of making movies to a new level with exemplary visual effects. And yes, the movie has a wonderful background score filled with energy- the movie starts with 'Also Sprach Zarathustra' and then 'Blue Danube' at beginning of the second scenario; these are the tracks that get 'loop'ed in your mind. The story may not be conveyed by the movie but i suggest those who really loved the film(for other reasons) to read this wonderful book by Arthur C.Clarke.Perhaps i'd lose an argument with a hardcore Star Wars fan over whether this movie is the greatest sci-fi ever made, as AFI rated it, but i loved this movie as much as i loved Star Wars. It might sound like a sacrilege to call 2001:A Space Odyssey a better sci-fi movie than Metropolis but Kubrick's effort to bring the unimaginable (in the near-future even in 2012) to the screen with the highest standards of perfection is laudable.",10,0,2,17 May 2012
Chariots of Fire," They are Englishmen!
","There are only a few movies in the world that make you feel they deserve the Best Picture at the very beginning of the movie. This movie is a perfect example for the aforementioned category.The movie begins with the United Kingdom athletes running on the shore and the background music gives you goose bumps. Harold is a Jew and a victim of bigotry. He is an athlete gifted with strong legs that makes him a good sprinter. He shatters the 700-year record of the University and makes himself conspicuous to the selectors. Eric is a devout Christian from Scotland and is the finest sprinters of the region. Harold and other athletes are spellbound when Eric topples during a race, falls behind other men in the race, gets up on his feet, and wins the race by a whisker. They race against each other and Eric emerges as the fastest man. A shocked Harold gets guidance and training from Sam and the men then head to Paris to compete in the 1924 Olympics. Eric withdraws from the 100m sprint saying it would be injustice if Harold and Eric- men from the same country- competed against each other on the eve of the race. Harold goes on to win the sprint ahead of the world's fastest men- Americans. The next day, Eric wins his 400m race and receives thunderous applause from all corners of the world for his sacrifice and glory.A powerful movie with powerful phrases and music.",10,0,0,28 May 2012
Some Like It Hot," Fifty-three years and still fuming
","A movie that is synonymous to the Internet jargon LOL(Laugh out loud) and ROFL(Rolling over the floor laughing). I must first shower encomiums on the out-of-the-world script. And what an actor Jack Lemmon is. This movie also established the long-term association between Jack Lemmon and Billy Wilder in making movies together.Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis gave one of the greatest performance by transvestites. While a luscious Marilyn Mornoe is there to seduce you, sing and shake and make you swoon, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis provide unlimited rib-tickling humor.Oh, i just forgot to mention what a brilliant, funny writing it was. There are umpteen phrases that make you reiterate.AFI rightly placed it at the helm of '100 greatest laughs'.",10,5,7,11 June 2012
Les Misérables," A historic Musical that mollifies the misery.
","When Tom Hooper won the Best Achievement in Directing Oscar two years back for 'The King's Speech', a friend said, 'Someday he'll pay the price for grabbing the statuette that belonged to David Fincher'. Well, his words came true. Tom Hooper was snubbed by the academy for directing one of the greatest Musicals, a genre seldom preferred by movie-goers and studio heads alike, in the present day.There have been umpteen adaptations of this fine piece of Literature and the makers of this version of 'Les Miserables', with all the script revisions and enhancements, have produced a movie that deserves an applause.The wonderful Production Design takes us back to the early years of a post-revolution-19th century France.Jean Valjean, played by Hugh Jackman, is incarcerated for stealing bread to feed his sister's daughter. He's out on parole. Offer shelter to a desperate man and he'll make you regret. Jean resorts to stealing silver articles from the church that offered him shelter and after being pardoned by the priest for his crime, he breaks his parole. Javert, played by Russell Crowe, pursues an absconding Jean Valjean.Eight years pass on, Jean, now a Mayor, owns a factory. Fantine, played by Anne Hathaway, is a pretty woman in the factory, is fired by the factory foreman. In desperation to care for and protect her daughter Cosette, she unwillingly turns to prostitution. Jean is touched and moved by Fantine's miserable plight and promises a dying Fantine that he'd take good care of her daughter, Cosette.After the Mayor confesses his true identity, Javert doesn't give up his quest for finding and bringing Jean back to justice. Jean, along with Cosette, is on the run.Nine years later, people are again infuriated by the ever-widening economic divide between the autocrats and the general populace, giving birth to another revolution. Cosette(Amanda Seyfried), now a beautiful woman, falls in love with Marius(Eddie Redmayne). Javert locates Jean and Jean takes Cosette away.Jean learns of his adopted daughter's love interest and goes back to find Marius, a man at the vanguard of the revolution. The rebels are crushed by the police force. Jean saves Marius' life and brings him back to Cosette and leaves. Cosette and Marius get married and Jean passes away.It is a well-known fact that the Best performance by an actor in a Leading Role statuette has the inscription 'Daniel Day-Lewis' on it, but it has been Hugh Jackman's best performance yet. Anne Hathaway, Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter have been really impressive and Russell Crowe's performance, I think, deserved a nod from the Academy.",8,3,5,25 January 2013
The Untouchables," Sad-Ness.
","If there's one reason why i feel justified for having watched this film, it's for the powerful background score by Ennio Morricone.The movie doesn't brag about having a melange of method actors, barring Robert De Niro, who i felt should have had more talking than his bluster and Bon mots.Another facet that drew my admiration was the tribute to the Odessa step sequence from the Russian epic 'The Battleship Potemkin'(1925). The extended time of the sequence adds to its suspense and elaborateness.Sean Connery got the award for his 'Irish' accent perhaps but it was Ennio Morricone who was snubbed, again.",7,0,0,4 September 2012
Mystic River," A movie with two Oscar-winning performances and worthy of many more
","Tragedies happen everyday, everywhere. Not many people dare to venture into making a movie that begins with tragedy and has one tragedy after another, and a tragic ending to a poignant tale. Clint Eastwood, with some brilliant performances by Tim Robbins and Sean Penn, has created a movie that leaves an impact on you.It's not a movie that has breathtaking car chases nor does it boast of CGI. It's a ubiquitous tale of a daughter seeking a life free from her parents, a father who buries his dreadful criminal past with the love for his family and three friends who share a dream that all of them wish never happened.It's a movie that makes you think while you watch.A brilliantly written,directed and presented movie.",9,1,1,10 October 2012
The Departed," The Taiwan thriller gets a touch of Scorsese
","Like most Scorsese's movies you get a feeling of being in a concert with a mixture of soul, classic rock and pop.'Gimme Shelter' by The Rolling Stones is one of Scorsese's favorite song and the movie thus begins with the song in background with Frank Costello briefing about the colored inhabitants of Boston and why America got independence.Frank Costello, played by Jack Nicholson, eclipses all the performances by Joe Pesci put together in Scorsese's films. And no one could have done it remotely close to Jack's performance which is why Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences felt an Oscar would be too demeaning for an actor of Jack's stature.In his academy award acceptance speech for the long-due Oscar for the Best Director, Scorsese mentioned Monahan's brilliant screen-writing as a 'crazy script' and you have to nod your heads for Scorsese's acumen.The script demands every actor to play a lead role and a supporting role as well. Alec Baldwin comes next in the list of performances in this 'Modern day masterpiece' with jokes delivered with a deadpan face and a rather grave voice that you could hardly realize he was joking after all.The movie is adapted from 'Mou Gaan Dou' but it will remain an epic Hollywood remake for at least half a century hence. 'Mou Gaan Dou' was awesome in every essence and i wished 'The Departed' ended in a similar fashion. The suspense that existed when watching Mou Gaan Dou for the first time doesn't exist when you watch The Departed for obvious reasons but Scorsese provides a real entertainer.Scorsese, Monahan, Schoonmaker and Graham King were all conferred with the coveted statuette while the actors were too good for one Oscar. So are the makers of the original movie.",Null,0,0,18 July 2012
Zero Dark Thirty," Mission accomplished!
","Mark Boal and Kathryn Bigelow, with 'The Hurt Locker', gave birth to the genre Semi-Fictional-Historic-Thriller. '. 'The Hurt Locker' was movie-making at its thrilling best. They have followed it up with 'Zero Dark Thirty'.It is really shocking to get to know that Kathryn Bigelow was snubbed a nomination in the Best Director category by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science, a nomination that I am quite sure would have fetched an Oscar.Mark Boal's brilliant screenplay takes us through the events from the eventful day of 9/11 to the day the most wanted man on Earth was terminated.Jessica Chastain was nominated last year in the Best Actress in a Supporting Role Category for the movie 'The Help'. She plays Maya, a CIA official who spends all her professional life in finding Osama Bin Laden. She is smart, focused and most of all, obsessed with finding Osama Bin Laden and leaves no stone unturned. She follows every lead out of a million leads from all over the world discreetly and narrows it down to his courier man, a man she takes 7 years to locate and confirm, by interrogating detainees all over the world.She is scoffed at by her all-male superiors and survives an assassination attempt by terrorists in Pakistan. She finally locates the house, a house believed to be offering succour to the Osama Bin Laden and after several months of inactivity, Maya is infuriated by the dilatory approach to terminate Bin Laden. They finally get a green light to terminate him. The SEALs team finishes the job without much difficulty.Jessica Chastain's performance as a recluse, snubbed by her superiors, but carries on her quest with a stiff upper lip, deserves an Oscar. The best in the Best Picture category this year. If you totally hate this movie and want archive footage of all the events that lead to the termination of Osama Bin Laden, kindly watch a documentary.",9,4,15,11 January 2013
There Will Be Blood," Method-acting revived through a brilliant script and direction
","Daniel Day-Lewis chooses his movies assiduously. He chooses a script in such a way that he gives his hundred per cent involvement in the role he is supposed to play. It's a 158-minute long movie with more than 95 per cent of the running time showing the actor in the lead role and no one else could have given an unblemished performance as Daniel.I was quite convinced it was a biography until i realized it wasn't. Daniel Day-Lewis gives life to a character that exists in the form of written text. He, with the help of Paul Thomas Anderson, has created a hard-working turned money-devouring, impertinent, petulant owner of an oil company. While the present day audience demand CGI and breath-taking visuals, Paul Thomas Anderson has shown us what the movie-making in its pristine form and standard really looks like.The movie revolves around the life of a certain Daniel Plainview who struggles over the years searching for the 'black gold' until his efforts bear to fruition one day. He expands his empire and with money comes the pride and power and thus a plutocrat is born. He talks in terms of money and likes to prevaricate when it comes to buying land. He even abandons his son, feels betrayed by a person who convinces him to be his half-brother and beats up a local evangelist. He resorts to feigning to have faith in god in order to acquire land, land that would help him lay pipeline all the way up to the sea.He ages with time and the obduracy and petulance he once possessed do not seem to have dwindled. He admits to not having any blood relatives when his son announces he was to start an oil company in Mexico with his just-married bride. He beats up the preacher he long despised to death.The movie may have lacked the gravitas that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science demands to vote it the Best Picture of the year but by all film-making standards set by The Godfather, One Flew over the Cuckoo's nest and The Shawshank Redemption, the movie has found a place among the most-vaunted movies of the world.",10,3,4,18 July 2012
To Kill a Mockingbird," The quintessential hero
","The first time i watched this movie when i was in the final year of school, i considered it totally boring. The second time i watched it(an year later), i didn't understand why it was voted the Greatest Courtroom Drama ahead of 12 Angry Men. So i decided to read the book by Harper Lee before watching the movie next time. It is one of the finest piece of Literature i've read and the movie is equally good.The movie is narrated by Scout, played by Mary Badham. Scout is the younger child of Atticus Finch, played by Gregory Peck. The movie focuses on the childhood days of Jem and Scout and what kind of a man their father was. The movie is set in the backdrop of a depression-hit Alabama of the 1930s where black people were subject to prejudice, ill-treatment and the laws of the state that were biased. A major part of the movie is about the kids Jem and Scout, until Atticus Finch dares to take up the case of a 'colored' man wrongly convicted of raping a white-woman. Atticus Finch is a father who is unmatched when it comes to taking care of his motherless children. He holds no discrimination against the 'colored' race and forces(after pampering sessions end) his daughter to apologize to their domestic servant; he also invites a 'colored' boy to dine with them and advices his daughter not to ridicule the way in which the kid ate. When Atticus Finch actually tries to prove the convicted man innocent, he gets threatened by the complainant's father and is despised by the people of the town. The man spits on Atticus' face. Normally you'd expect a six-foot plus tall man with a broad frame to strike the other man down but Atticus takes his handkerchief and wipes off the spittle. Such an inspiring character he is and AFI rightly called him the Greatest Hero of all-time. He, despite knowing the fact that the 'colored' man wasn't convicted and had firm evidence to substantiate his argument, he loses the case thanks to the prejudiced laws of the state. When he is despised by the people of the town, an oddball who has been deserted by everyone comes to the rescue of Scout when a drunkard attacks her.The first half of the movie is enjoyed not only by kids but by everyone who has been a kid and reminisce the sweet memories of being innocent, playful, stubborn, and the umpteen petty fights one had had. The second half of the movie, i call it from the time of Atticus taking up the case, is better appreciated by someone who is grownup.",10,0,1,14 May 2012
Stalag 17," Golden Holden claims the golden statuette
","For a major part of the movie, i was quite convinced that J.J.Sefton, played by William Holden was the 'rat in the house'. Sefton is mistaken for trading the secrets of the camp with the Nazi officers for money and wealth. He is a connoisseur of cigars and alcohol. His collections draws a few 'raised eyebrows' and on one fine day they are convinced that he was the two-timer. He gets brutally hit by his roommates, stolen of his priceless collections and is ostracized from the rest. He takes a vow to prove his innocence and also bring the real culprit to the other inmates of the camp and he discreetly observes, construes, corroborates and then proves it to the others who the real double-crosser was, and also manages to escape from the POW camp.The movie has every ingredient from Billy Wilder's recipe of making the finest movies- wit, cinematography, William Holden's acting and art-direction.",9,2,3,10 June 2012
Toy Story 3," For those who don't own toys anymore and those who are on the verge of packing them for disposal
","Yes. It's a kids movie. Not just this one, but the prequels were meant for kids. Is it wrong for a 21-year old man to love the trilogy? I feel justified for loving the trilogy and the latest movie in particular.I feel i was born at the right time and was of the right age to like the movies. I was 4 when 'Toy Story' was the next big thing in Animation after The Lion King, 8 when 'Toy Story 2' hit the theaters and 19 when it finally concluded(now that 'Toy Story 4' has been announced). I did enjoy all the movies but was too old to believe in talking and walking toys and figments of imagination anymore.I watched Toy Story 3 to finish off the series and get done with it. But, it was something i had not anticipated. The plot and the storyline is predictable and is meant to be- it's directed towards the below 18 age group. But it was the theme that caught my eyes and mind. A grownup boy feels its time to part with his boyhood buddies- his toys. I love the way the toys try desperately to draw his attention in the beginning, in vain.Yes, i did have toys and had monologues with those plastic things that can't talk and there was a time i happily threw them off. But, there's a secret vault in my heart that still broods over the time i had with my playmates. Thanks to the makers for helping me reminisce.",8,0,1,8 June 2012
Moonrise Kingdom," A perfect mixture of innocence and romance
","Rob Reiner's 'Stand by Me' is regarded as the best children's tale ever made as a motion picture, without taking into consideration the animated films that have been coming out for more than five decades with improved technologies with each passing year.Wes Anderson has revived the dreams of most troubled teenagers through this beautiful motion picture for which he penned the script too.The movie is set in the backdrop of a colorful, verdant island in '65 in America. A parallel plot, which deals with the most intense storm that swept the island in its history, links the main plot that shows us the happenings of the days preceding the storm.Two troubled teenagers who meet at a play, like each other the first time they lay eyes on each other. They become pen pals and bond over regular letters. The boy despises his foster parents as much as the girl despises her blood parents. They set out in the woods and the boy, being a scout(or 'a former khaki scout' as he calls it) camp in the woods. They are pursued by the fellow scouts and local police and are finally captured the next day.Their capture doesn't deter their relationship. The fellow scouts who previously didn't approve of the boy, make up their minds and help the boy and the girl get off the island. They even get married with the help of one of the scout's cousin. The storm arrives and everyone's caught in the midst of the storm. And what follows is an unpredictable, yet apt ending for this movie that reminds us all how things were bright and beautiful when 'innocence' existed.I really loved the camera work, the editing and the euphonious background score. The humor is immanent and the plot may not leave you with rib tickling jokes, but will leave you smiling nonetheless.Ironically, I must agree it's not a children's tale.",8,6,9,25 December 2012
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The quintessential father-son duo
","Sean Connery and Ford have portrayed the best father-son duo on screen. They have disparate views on religion, Jones Sr. is too preoccupied searching for the Holy Grail throughout his life and spares no time for his son 'Junior' but the passion for archeology unites them. They even charm the same woman.The movie is a melange of religion, fantasy, history and adventure. Humor is immanent. The movie may not have the breathtaking visuals like the first movie of the franchise. Neither does it have gore sacrifices and violence as in the second part. George Lucas-Steven Spielberg pair remains the best movie-making pair hitherto.A 10/1o movie.",10,1,2,14 August 2012
