Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," boring
","I had a chance to see 'Borat: Cultural Learnings of America Â…' yesterday. I didn't like it. The movie had no action and was so slow that I almost fall asleep. I expected something more sophisticated. His previous show - AliG Show was much funnier. Probably because there were more characters and it made the show more interesting. In this movie main character is boring, he does all the time the same things although he supposed to learn. I really liked AliG show but Borat disappointed me a lot. There is not to many movies I stopped watching before it ends. I usually pick good movies to watch but with this one I was wrong. I couldn't stand watching it. I really advise you not to see that bad movie. I don't know how anybody can enjoy it.",3,5,10,12 December 2006
