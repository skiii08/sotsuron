Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Ugh.
","This movie was a real mess.George Lucas did so little with so much.  The story was dull and the acting uninspired.  The effects were awesome, but if I wanted effects, I'd have waited for 'Star Wars I: the video game.'I hope Star Wars II (if it ever gets made) is directed by someone else...",1,0,1,7 June 1999
