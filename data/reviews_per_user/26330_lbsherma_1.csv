The Lobster," Goofy and dull
","Even after the obligatory head-scratching from the confusing opening (and the usual, modern day mumbling mix of poor speech delivery and horribly mixed background sound and music), this film just takes too much getting used to. Some of the tres-noir humor is quite funny, but mostly lost in the flat affects and depressing absurdity. I recently saw an excellent local production of 'Waiting for Godot,' and it was downright light-hearted compared to this. After ten minutes I was saying 'got it,' and not sure why I sat through the rest. To what depths goes sarcastic satire? Apparently endless.",3,1,1,19 February 2017
