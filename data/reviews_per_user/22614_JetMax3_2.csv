The Ring," Definitely one of the more thought-out and intelligent horror movies...
","This is one of the best horror or science fiction movies you will ever come across. It competes with the likes of Poltergeist, and is an instant classic in all respects. As is usual, it takes a certain type of person to appreciate it for what it really is, and those who were more than content with it likely didn't bother to comment on it here. So you can disregard just about ever negative post here, since you have to really go out and see it for yourself to make that judgement.Regardless, The Ring is an excellent flick with a winning idea behind it. It has a symbol (the ring itself, of course) and what has to be one of the most original plot lines anyone has seen. A video tape that kills you seven days after you watch it, subliminal hints at what will become your ultimate fait, and a truly unique character to be afraid of. Yes, it will leave a lot of loose ends untied at the end, but that's the point. You will remain affected by this movie long after you have finished watching it.This is a deserving addition to really everyone's home library, whether you thought it was just 'okay' or utterly fantastic. It's truly a one-in-a-million movie, much like The Sixth Sense, Titanic and Poltergeist. Don't pass this one up. At least bother to see it once before giving up hope.Anyway, to wrap things up, this instantly became one of my favorite movies and has all the fixings of a well-done theatrical feature. And I really, really hope they slap on a sequel to clear up some of the confusion that seems to be plagueing a lot of watchers. Excellent, fantastically done movie.Before you die, you see the ring.",Null,1,1,11 May 2003
Titanic," A very moving movie...
","Almost a century ago, the magnificent ship cristened the Titanic sailed the ocean waters. It was the grandest ship of them all, and its luxury was unsurpassed at the time. But little did anyone know that its first voyage would also be its last and would come to be known as the grandest ship wreck of all time.After sitting beneath the waves of the Atlantic ocean for all this time, with only history texts and low-quality photographs documenting it, the era and the event has finally been brought back to life in its full glory. James Cameron's 1997 'Titanic' faithfully reproduces the ship itself as well as the tragic events that occured that faitful April night and with it unravels an untold love story that despite being fictional really brings the full emotion of the event to a personal level and humanizes the tragedy.This movie provides a little something for everyone. Romance, tragedy, action, adventure, all into one perfect mixture. Titanic has an awesome story and inspiring special effects and professional art to back it up. This film did not receive so many awards and nominations for nothing. The soundtrack is complete and touching in its own right, and the fiction and truth that make up the plot dance seamlessly and gracefully together.If you haven't seen this movie yet, witch considering its success is difficult to believe, then you definitely should. All three hours, give or take, is packed with candy for your eyes and ears as well as a wonderful story that will keep you on the edge of your seat. This will forever be a classic and a movie to remember. I will be watching this movie again years from now, and then many years from then.I give it a perfect ten out of ten, for me there were very few blemishes on this feature.On the grandest ship, under the worst circumstances, during the greatest sinking of all time, a story of love and passion unfolds for two people lost at sea. One will make it out, one will not, but they know that they will always be together--in their heart, at least.",10,1,3,11 May 2003
