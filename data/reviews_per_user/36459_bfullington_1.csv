Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Don't let the haters fool you. Entertaining and engaging film, better than the first.
","What these Hollywood critics don't understand is that Guy Ritchie's 'Sherlock Holmes' is an ADAPTATION. The films aren't supposed to be verbatim of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's novels. Besides, if the movies were made to resemble the books, 85% of the population wouldn't be able to enjoy, let alone understand, them due to the vocabulary/dialogue. Imagine Shakespeare brought to the silver screen, along with all of the old English dialogue. Everyone praises 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'Harry Potter', but they aren't anywhere close to their book counterparts either. Both series are entertaining and engaging, as is Sherlock Holmes. You will laugh multiple times. You will find compelling characters. The story is full of twists and turns. The action is exciting and well-thought-out. The cinematography is excellent. Robert Downey Jr. is charismatic and lovable as Sherlock. This film is well worth the watch, so be your own judge and see it for yourself. You won't be disappointed.",8,2,7,19 December 2011
