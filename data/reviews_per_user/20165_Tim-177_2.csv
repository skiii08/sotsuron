","I liked this movie, but not as much as I liked the 1989 original.  Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeiffer, both of whom I like, both overplayed their parts.  Michael Keaton practically just slid back into his character from last time.  I think my favorite actor in 'Returns' is Christopher Walken, mainly because he didn't ham it up too much.  BE PREPARED FOR THE VIOLENCE IN THIS MOVIE.  There's more violence in this than in the 1989 original; a friend of mine who saw this movie with me calls it 'The Oswald Cobblepot Bloodbath.'",6,0,0,11 March 1999
