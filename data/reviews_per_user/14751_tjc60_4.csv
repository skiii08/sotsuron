The Blair Witch Project," A good rental, but not much replay value.
","There is a certain amount of 'evolutionary baggage' inherent in human nature. We as humans all have 'buttons', that when pushed just right can evoke a strong emotional response. Stephen King has referred to these as 'psychic pressure points'. Examples: fear of the dark. Fear of being lost in the wilderness while being stalked by unseen enemies. Fear of the supernatural. Fear of old abandoned dwellings. This film deftly presses on these pressure points, and the result is a fairly frightening movie. The amateurish cast adds a bit of realism to the story, and is the reason for the big box office draw. The cadence of the story lacks consistency, but the last 5-10 minutes will have any but the most jaded horror fans on the end of their seats. Sadly, though, once you've seen it once, you can never quite regain the feeling of white-knuckled suspense you had the first time you saw it.",5,0,2,8 May 2004
Schindler's List," One of the best films of the 90's
","Initially presented as capitalistic and crude, Schindler's character gradually evolves into one of benevolence, and finally, humility. The film is shot entirely in black and white, with the exception of one character. A little girl wearing a pink jacket, which we see only twice in the film. It is that little girl, and the thought of what surely must happen to her, that sticks in one's mind. The two fleeting glimpses we get of this girl are more heart-wrenching than anything else in this film. This is not only an historical film;it has modern relevance as well. There are monsters among us, and poverty and ignorance are their life's blood. Overall,I give the film a 9. It's truly hard for a film to rate a 10 with me, which is the way it should be.",9,9,13,2 May 2004
The Silence of the Lambs," The 'Casablanca' of horror films.
","This is quite possibly the scariest movie since 'The Exorcist'. Metaphorically speaking, Hannibal Lecter appears to be The Serpent to Clarice Starling's Eve. Hannibal is a member of elite society; a representation of the best our civilization has to offer. His  Jeckyl-Hyde persona is a mockery of that civilization, and thus Satan-like. Starling, the would-be savior of the 'lambs', is inexplicably drawn to him. This is without a doubt one of the best good-vs-evil stories ever filmed. The cast, from Anthony Hopkins, to Jodie Foster, to Anthony Heald as the creepy Dr. Chilton, to the unforgettable Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill, was remarkable. It would have gotten a 10, but certain plot elements weren't very plausible, such as the FBI assigning a student to the case. Otherwise it was a great film.",9,1,1,2 May 2004
Goodfellas," One of Scorseses best
","From the film's opening to it's conclusion I was hooked. What at first appears to be a glorification of the gangster lifestyle gradually evolves into a cautionary tale, graphically depicting the violence and treachery of this way of life. Based on the experiences of real-life ex-gangster Henry Hill, one-time associate of New York's Luchese crime family, the film gives an inside look at organized crime as it really is. Joe Pesci as the murderous Tommy DeVito absolutely steals the show. It is worth the price of the DVD just to see this talented and versatile performer in action. Ray Liotta gives a good performance as Henry Hill, but is overshadowed by Lorraine Bracco, who plays Henry's over-the-top wife Karen. Robert DeNiro's performance is so-so. Overall, I'd rate this an 8.5/10.",8,3,6,8 May 2004
