Captain Phillips," A Frantic Fight for Survival
","While the film is a bit slow to start, once the pace begins to pick up it grips the viewer relentlessly. Some of my favorite parts of the film are also some of the most off-putting for me. I don't want to give too much away, but I will say that the film is inherently a pageant of American supremacy. It may be based on a true story, but it was clearly crafted to appeal to the crowds of blindly prideful Americans that can often be heard chanting, 'U.S.A.! U.S.A.!' at sporting events. The film briefly touches on the lives of the ensnared pirates—who have to choose between becoming pirates in order to pay warlords or be killed—but it never elaborates on the subject. The slight bit of empathy created toward the pirates is engulfed in the awe of a U.S. Naval warship, unmanned aerial drones, and a squad of Navy SEALs jumping from a military aircraft. This muted attempt to provide a balanced perspective ultimately seemed irrelevant, which was my only major qualm with the film. Still, I don't think that the one-sided portrayal of the story should dissuade anyone from seeing it. Tom Hanks' continuously powerful performance is reason enough for me to recommend this movie to frequent moviegoers. Those who only catch a flick in theaters every couple months may want to make this one a rental.",7,4,16,2 October 2013
