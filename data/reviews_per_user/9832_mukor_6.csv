Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lucas Grows Up... And Becomes the Empire
","Star Wars will always have a phenomenal impact on me.  As I child, it was the first film where I became part of the story that was unfolding on the screen in front of me.  I recall fondly Christmas morning of 1977 and opening my very first Han Solo figurine.  No sooner did I have Han and Darth out that I was enacting my own (overly) dramatic scenes between these two legendary cinematic characters.Star Wars (and Empire and Jedi to follow) remain legendary films in my mind. They were the creation of an idealistic dreamer, a subversive reacting to an increasingly Imperial society.  They were nothing short of revolutionary for me, both in my thinking and in my bearing in years to come.Then comes along The Phantom Menace and all becomes clear.  Lucas has become that which he opposed those many years ago.  With Lucasfilm, Industrial Light & Magic, and the (in)famous ranch where he lives (shades of William Randolph Hearst?), George Lucas *is* the empire.  It seems now he has lost the spirit of the trilogy.  Phantom Menace is technically masterful.  Effects are seemless, the pod race spectacular, and the sets beautiful.  But there is an emptiness to everything, devoid of the spirit and magic of the trilogy.  In fact, I think he made conscious choices to distance himself from the mysticism of the first three films.  He reduces one of the beautiful mysteries of the trilogy, The Force, to a biological function.  Those who have the biology for the force can mold it and shape it.  Overlooking the clear racist overtones of this conceit (The Jedi Knight; pure blooded master of the Universe!), there is a simpler problem with reducing the mystical to the mundane: it wasn't necessary!  There is no need to explain the Force or reason people are 'strong' with the force.  The first three movies, it just was.  No explanation needed nor given.  The empire reigns.  The magic, however, is gone.",4,0,1,7 February 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Faithful, Beautiful, Magical Adaptation
","Peter Jackson is perhaps the best kept secret to film making.  AfterLord of the Rings, his secret status is in serious jeopardy.  Hisadaptation of The Fellowship of the Ring is the most faithful,remarkably beautiful film to come out of Hollywood in a long time. This coming from a New Zealander best known for a lawn mowergraphically splattering hundreds of zombies across the silver (andcrimson screen).  Who would have thought it?  Well, those of uswho have been enamoured of Jackson's peculiar genius for thelast few years knew he was the man for the job.  Now allspeculation can cease.In the three hours that Fellowship of the Ring unfolds before oureyes, we are greeted to a rich and thoroughly detailed fantasysetting, one which is as real as it is fantastical.  The Shire iseverything that it should be, Rivendell is unpredictable yetstunning, and Lothlorien is nothing short of magical. 
If sacrifices were made, it was in the fleshing out of the'secondary' members of the Fellowship, such as Gimli, Mary,Pippin, and Boromir.  Nevertheless, Tolken's work is such adetailed creation it was inevitable that some characterizationwould be lost in a cinematic retelling.  Jackson does the best hecan within the confines of a limited time frame presented to him inthe film format.  Hopes run high for an extended DVD which furtherdevelops the important supporting cast.Despite this one small quibble, The Fellowship of the Ring cast acinematic spell unlike any I have been subject to in a very longtime.  For 180 minutes, I sat quivering in my seat, unable to lookaway even for a split second.  No spoilers and please, avoid reading any reviews that includeany before you see the film.  There are some spells that are bestexperienced without the benefit of a crystal ball.",10,0,0,19 December 2001
Armageddon," Armageddon, the End of Time, the End of Good Film
","This movie makes me angry.  In a way, I see it as hailing  in a new era of filmmaking, one where the anticipated, sought after, big budget films of the summer are reduced to script-by-committee, special effects laden, bore fests.  Sure, there have been such movies prior to this debacle but this ridiculous gross of this idiot movie would seem to indicate that this style of film is here to stay, whether we want it or not.We all know the premise of the film already:  Bruce Willis, deep core driller and the most unlikeable main character to grace the screen in a long time, is asked by the government to help destroy world threatening asteroid.To tag along for the ride is Ben Affeck, generally a favorite of mine, whose romantic leading man character is so schmarmy as to give the strongest amongst us stomach palpatations.  Scenes between he and Liv Tyler (in yet another typically Hollywood throwaway cheesecake female role) made me yearn for a handy airline barfbag.  Romance is well and good but these scenes were painful, as if director Michael Bay learned everything he knows about romance from Hallmark commercials.  Bleh...To top things off, the movie is unbearably long clocking in around 2 1/2 hours!!!Avoid this movie like the plague or, if you want to see the future of big budget summer stupid fests, look no further.  Armageddon is for you.",1,4,9,30 June 2001
Men in Black II," Why, Barry?!? Why?
","Before I begin, let me start by saying that the original Men in Blackwas the film version of M&Ms; delicious, satisfying, and amazinglyquick to disappear.  That is to say, Men in Black was the idealsummer movie, 90 minutes of pure fun and enjoyment, nomoments wasted, every piece working to serve the whole, theideal summer movie.  Will Smith was perfectly suited for his roleas 'J', the young and impressionable cop turned Man in Black.  Hismannerisms predicted an excellent career as a physicalcomedian, full of wide eyed wonder and bemused exuberance. Tommy Lee Jones was a perfect deadpan 'K', the wily eyed veteranwhose witticisms were all the more funny because of his deadpannature ('we at the FBI have no sense of humor that we are awareof').  Good stuff.  And we actually had a villain worth watching inVincent D'Onofrio as the largest cockroach in the universe. 
In Men in Black II, Smith once again seems bemused and Jones...well, Jones just seems dead.  This is the perfect example of asequel created for all the wrong reasons: commercial tie-insabound, product placement is everywhere (since when is there aSpring PCS store at MiB headquarters?), and the script appears tohave largely been an afterthought to the over-the-top specialeffects which are, quite frankly, no better than the previous film.  Asmy good friend Jay pointed out, Tommy Lee Jones looks like he iscalculating how much money he is making for this film andwonder whether its worth it.  Will Smith does his level best but hisrole as the cocky veteran only works to show how tired this filmfeels.    Lara Flynn Boyle is the new alien bent on destruction thistime around but the plot makes little to no sense (granted, theseare high concept movies to begin with but there should at least bea modicum of thought put into even a bubble gum film).  She islargely listless and uninteresting.  And poor Rip Torn as the headof MiB has nothing to do at all this time around except get encasedin alien vines.Most of the blame for this rests squarely on the shoulders of BarrySonnenfeld, a director that I have previously admired a great deal. The original MiB, Get Shorty, and the Addams Family movies areall excellent examples of timing, pacing, and scripting working tocreate an entertaining whole.  Everything about MiBII seems off inthese regards.  Scenes seem flat, the characters interactions arereduced to sound bites (Seen the trailer?  That's about the pacingfor this whole film), and everyone looks like they would rather beelsewhere.If you want dumb comedy this summer, go see Scooby Dooinstead.  At least it has some genuine belly laughs.  MiBII willsimply make youur belly ache for the original.",2,1,1,12 July 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A solid if safe adaptation
","I am a major fan of the books.  Yes, I know what the cinemaphilesout there are thinking:  keep the film and the book separate.  Imyself have made this complaint often with those who spend timecriticizing films based on the fact that directors and writers willoften take liberties with the plot and spirit of the book they areadapting.Nevertheless, as a fan of the books, I was pleased to see thatChris Columbus didn't take  the low road with this film as he mostcertainly is want to do.  He has created a remarkably faithful, solidadaptation of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.  He has alsotaken virtually no risks in doing so.  The Sorcerer's Stone is Rowling's first and, IMHO, the least of herfour novels to this date.  This isn't because the book is bad; noindeed, the book is quite delightful.  It simply lacks the coherenceof the coherence of the next three.  This is largely due to the factthat she is creating a singularly unique and rich environment thatshe is just introducing in the first book, with little emphasis placedon plot and storyline instead concentrating largely on introducingthe environment and the characters that are intrinsic to thatenvironment.Columbus' film suffers the same fate, only to a larger scalebecause of the inherent limitations of cinema.  It would have beenimpossible for the film to have anything but a fractured feel to itwhen the book itself suffers a similar fate.  Nevertheless, he getsthe important points right, from the swept-along-by-fateforthrightness of Harry himself to the charming know-it-allpluckiness of Hermione.  The setting too is delightful, a magicallytwisted barrage of corridors, castles, and dungeons.  I have high hopes for the next film; however, I do hope that someday Mr. Columbus learns how to hold a shot long enough toprevent the scattershot feel of The Sorcerer's Stone.  Alas, perhapsthis is too much to hope for from the director of Home Alone.",8,0,0,19 December 2001
Gladiator," Ben Hur Lite
","Gladiator is an infuriating movie, an immensely overrated Ben Hur light that is clearly a graduate of the Armageddon school of filmmaking.  Nevertheless, it does some things very well.  And this is the problem perhaps. The combat sequences are a sight to behold, as exhilarating in their beautiful bloodshed as anything Ridley Scott has ever done (and he is the American master of beautiful bloodshed). But the drama that connects these sequences seem only filler, existing only to move us (sometimes in a most incoherent way geographically speaking) to the next moment Russell Crowe gets to bear his teeth and fight another battle.  But how is this a good movie?  If anything Gladiator is more of a punched up, swords a blazing series of dance numbers.  The drama rests on the shoulders of a one note performance by Russell Crowe, whose core emotion seems to be one of grimace and pout.  He is a character who has one desire and one desire only:  revenge.  Many critics loved the intensity of the performance but why?  A complex, interesting character should have complexity to them.  But this character has no complexity, no range of emotions: he is a Stallone character trapped in an art film.Joaquim Phoenix, on the other hand, was a delight, an over the top sociopath who brings a few precious moments of levity to an otherwise drab, ugly, and humorless film.",3,0,2,16 July 2001
