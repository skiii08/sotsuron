The New World," An all time low in cinematography
","THE NEW WORLD is one of worst movies made in the last 20 years. There are many things wrong with it, but I will try and focus on the most relevant ones. First of all, the props while being contemporary looks cheap which lower the overall appearance. The story would fit a 40 minute TV-episode and yet the movie is 150 minutes. The casting is also very questionable. The acting of Q'orianka Kilcher and Colin Farrell is extremely bad and the chemistry between the two is none existing. If they where brother and sister in real life, the kissing scenes would probably be less awkward. If anything good should be said, it would be that Christian Bale does a solid effort as 'John Rolfe' but once he appears, it's too late to save the movie from being an absolute failure.Some people might be fooled by the beautiful scenery, the classical music and the low tempo. But these ingredients are actually what destroys the movie. When you combine it with poor editing, useless acting and a shallow story you're left with viewers wanting the last hours of their life back. I would not recommend 'The new world' to anyone.",1,0,4,17 June 2010
