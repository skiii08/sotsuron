Casablanca," One of Hollywood's best, Bogart's second-best performance (SPOILERS)
","This is a great movie, and one of the best examples of the Golden Age.  The movie works not only because of a great script, great cast, and great minimalist direction, but because it provides an excellent sense of time and place.  Few movies are so directly linked to the time in which they were made.  In 1942 the outcome of the war was a question mark, as was the Nazi threat.  This movie was made when nobody was sure who would win, and it shows.  The desperation of the characters, from Rick himself to bit parts that receive only five seconds of screen time, comes across perfectly without being over-stated or glossed over to give the love triangle more screen time.  In fact, forget the love triangle, the real struggle in this movie is in Rick (though as this movie's script is so heavily analyzed by every film school in the country, I'm probably not saying anything new).Few major Hollywood productions have such human characters.  Nobody in this movie is an archetype, they are all flawed, they make mistakes, and most importantly they will all redeem themselves in some way (except for the Nazis, who would certainly not be shown redeeming themselves in a war-time movie).  Sydney Greenstreet is a criminal, and proud of it, yet he decides to give Ilsa and Victor some helpful information, admitting that he doesn't see how it helps him.  Claude Rains is a despicable pig who uses his authority to get sexual favors from desperate women, and he too is proud of this, yet at the end he also redeems himself.Some people have said that this movie has the best supporting cast in history, and they may be right.  The Bulgarian girl, Rick's staff, Peter Lorre, Victor Laszlo, Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet, Sam, and the Nazi who looks like Porky Pig with a monocle.  I said in the header that this is Bogart's second-best performance, and the first would be Treasure of the Sierra Madre (you saw that coming, I'm sure).Unfortunately a lot of the dramatic impact of this movie, especially the finale, will be ruined for many younger viewers like myself, because it is so endlessly quoted and imitated in other movies, books, tv shows, etc. This is a darn shame.  Nevertheless, I gave this movie a 10/10.",10,2,3,1 July 2004
The Thing," More than horror, an interesting study
","Okay, it makes me shudder to say such cheesy things, but this movie is less a horror movie (sorry Carpenter) than a 'study in fear.'  Phew, pretentious, I know, but it's the simplest way to describe it.  By fear I mean the fear each of the characters is experiencing, not necessarily the audience's fear (although this *is* a scary movie).  As in a lot of Carpenter's movies, the premise and tone is very Lovecraftian, which involves a lot of hinting at horrors past, and horrors to come.The story is adapted from a short narrative called Who Goes There? that was made into a movie by Hawks in the fifties (I have not been able to find a copy of Who Goes There? but Carpenter's version is supposedly more faithful to the original concept).  The idea is that a creature has gotten into an arctic research station and is able to become any other organism there, whether dog, human, or something kinda between the two.  That's all you need to know.  We watch as the men at the station try to come to grips with their situation, controlling their fear while trying to decide which one of them is the creature, and most importantly, how to kill it so it doesn't reach civilization and conquer Earth.  It's a light-hearted romp for both young and old.",9,0,1,20 June 2004
Duck Soup," Didn't laugh once
","*Somebody* has to say it, you either get this movie or you don't, and you're not some kind of idiot if you don't.  This movie just fell flat with me, it relied too heavily on cheesy, nonsensical wordplay, and the Marx brothers seem to have a standard, all-purpose delivery for every single joke:  fast. The famous 'slow burn' scene felt amateurish to me.  The lauded 'anarchy' in this movie strikes me as a lame excuse for sloppy editing and writing, I guess it's easier for a scene to lead into another with no segway at all, or for pun-oriented conversations to begin and end like a light going on and off.  Really, this is not so much a movie as a string of miscellaneous gags with a VERY flimsy story to try to tie it all together.  If you want an example of classic comedy intertwining elegantly with a story watch a Chaplin or Keaton movie.Shouldn't the Marx brothers be totally forgotten by now?",Null,3,9,20 June 2004
Singin' in the Rain," Dull, unfunny, and over-rated.
","Don't bother to try to change my opinion, I just don't like this movie.  I didn't think it was funny, or entertaining, or anywhere near being worthy of all the accolades.  Why do people mention this movie in the same breath as Hidden Fortress or City Lights?  It's obscene and insulting.  This is no classic movie.  This is just a stage musical in front of a camera.  And why is that one dance number near the end so interminably long?Musicals and non-musicals should be kept separate from each other, as documentaries are not put in the same category with fictional or 'depicted non-fiction' movies.  If you want to like musicals, fine, but don't insist that *I* have to like them in order to 'appreciate film.'",1,22,62,21 June 2004
Pulp Fiction," One-dimensional modernist pap (minor spoilers)
","Is it possible that something so loathsome and awful could actually be adored and lauded by millions of people?  Is it only a matter of chance that some movies are loved and others hated, regardless of their content?  I hope this is true, because I cannot believe that there is actually anything good about the movie Pulp Fiction to lead any sane, reasoned, drug-free person to write the glowing comments that surround mine, much less the oodles of people who actually handed over their money to see this thing.Why is this movie so bad, you ask?  Okay, I'll tell you, even though it's like pointing out why windows are transparent.  Starting with the script, I see no reason to be impressed by an assemblage of overly stylistic dialogue and flat, boring characters.  There is nothing amazing about two guys talking about French McDonald's restaurants, and then killing some guys. Every awful stretch of dialogue is dragged out as long as it will last, and then some.  It's as if Tarantino said to himself 'I think I can cram one more line about milkshakes in here'.  You have to give him credit for padding the film in ways that nobody's ever tried before.  The actors look as though they're doing their best to salvage this turkey (and they are talented), all the while knowing in the back of their minds how much of a cow pie the whole thing is.  As far as Tarantino's directorial style is concerned, he should just get himself a career in Nike commercials because that's where his talent level cuts off.",1,152,375,9 April 2002
Raging Bull," I flatter myself I know something about movies, but...
","Okay, let me explain where I'm coming from.  I'm a movie fan.  I mean a really big movie buff.  My favorite directors are Chaplin, Keaton, Kubrick, Fellini, Tarkovksy, Malick, Wilder, Kurosawa, Welles, Reed, Lean, Bergman, Gilliam, Coen, Vidor, Ford, Benigni, and Cocteau, to name a few.  But I had never gotten around to even seeing a movie by Scorsese, although I'd heard great things about him.  You can imagine how excited I was to see that Raging Bull was number 2 on the Sight and Sound director's poll, and ranked the best movie of the 80s.  I was gung ho.  I was hoping to add Scorsese to my list of favorites.  But then, I actually saw Raging Bull.  I cannot for the life of me understand the glowing praise about this movie.  Is it a bad movie?  No.  It's just nothing special.  Scorsese's technique is, if anything, showy.  De Niro and Pesci are wonderful actors, there's no denying that.  But the movie as a whole just isn't particularly good.  I can find nothing about this movie that would bring it even close to the accolades it has been given.  Believe me, I wanted to like this movie.  I thought it would be great and then some; equal to the Searchers or 2001, from the praise it got; but it was uninteresting.  It was like the type of movie arthouse theaters show that is competently made but lifeless and boring, like Shine.  I'm sorry.  Call me an idiot.  I did not like this movie.",4,56,102,23 May 2002
Goodfellas," Not a bad movie, but not that great either
","Typical Scorsese effort: average crime movie script dressed up with great acting and pretentious, way overly stylish camera-work.I'm amazed this movie holds anyone's attention, let alone earns the 'best movie ever!' praise you hear about this one. As I said, I didn't think it was bad, it was just wasn't that good. I had to force myself to keep watching, trying once again to see what other people see in Scorsese. I get the feeling all the praise and accolades heaped on him are just a big prank being played on me.At least the Godfather was an actual good movie, although certainly no masterpiece.A far, far better movie than this that came out around the same time would be Miller's Crossing. It's actually entertaining--you don't feel like killing yourself after watching it for just a few minutes, which is another thing about Scorsese I don't like. His slickness, bleak subject matter, unredeeming violence all combine to create an effect like a low-frequency earthquake hum or day-old shellfish--it's nauseating and depressing. I honestly spend the rest of the day depressed and joyless after watching a Scorsese film. You may say that's the power of the film maker, but I say that's simply the power of the subject matter. Manos: the Hands of Fate is pretty depressing for much the same reason.Art shouldn't always be uplifting (I love Bicycle Thief and the Year of Living Dangerously) but if it's going to put such misery on the screen then it should have a good reason for doing it and it should teach me something.A good example of how hollow the praise for Scorsese and his works rings is the famous Copacabana scene, a two or three minute steadicam shot following two characters from the outside of a nightclub as they wind through the kitchens and so forth and end up at their table. Scorsese's fans call this 'the best shot ever.' As I said, it's a long shot of a fellow getting a table. Kubrick did great tracking shots too, but the key to a great tracking shot, like any shot, is that it communicates something significant to us, puts us in the state of mind of the characters, etc. But this was just some people walking to their table. The difference is contextual and often subtle, but it's there.",4,53,124,27 February 2007
