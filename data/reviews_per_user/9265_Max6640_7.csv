United 93," Did America really get taken down by school kids with knifes???
","Hmmmm not a great movie as most was clearly made up concerning the goings on in the plane even with the phone calls to loved ones I'm dubious.But did the Great USA really get taken down by some dirty child terrorists or did they have help from people closer to home?Not a chance that this could happen for real..... Without inside help. Every action by the civilian aviation met with complete incompetence by the US military and governemt???? Does that sound remotely true?Governemt offials AWOL at a time if crisis ... Thought bush was reading an upside down book to kids at a school and yet he couldn't be contacted??? And vice pres....AWOL??? No commander to defend the US in that scenario?Many innocent people lest their lives......for what??? And because of who???? Maybe the ones who did it were in power and needed an way to take more control over the people and wage war!!Anyway, just a theory that couldn't possibly be true.",5,2,8,6 November 2019
Captain Marvel," This will give women a false sense of security
","With the likes of Captain America and Iron man receeding into the past Disney has opted to provide women in the role of super human hero's. The problem is believability .... Regardless of a but of fun or not no one takes it seriously that women can be tough kicking role models. That's just the way it is.Even the toughest of women and let me be clear it's a tiny insignificant portion of society they are only as tough and physically capable as the mediocre average male.Even women in power like the director of the CIA as a female will have males to do their bidding like torture and physical enforcement. No man fears a woman (except the sissy millenials raised since 1996 birthdates) ever. No testersterone filled man would have any reason to fear a female.But the silly promotion of women's power is leading lots of young girls down the wrong path. They suddenly think they can be tough and they can be female bullies. Well it's doesnt work. All you have to do is look at the rising domestic violence records and see that higher numbers of women are trying to be tough and them getting knocked back down to earth and suffering from domestic violence. Yes domestic violence has male victims too (trying not to laugh here) and we should take that as seriously as women's plight (again tears streaming down my face from laughter) but it's not working out.A lot of men respect females and rightly so. But females have become mouthy, vinidctive, manipulative and then suffe the result of that. We never condone seeing a woman hit and slap a man during an argument but bekeive me if men get slapped and hit over the head.....that woman has to be careful because if there are no witnesses around.....she will be knocked out. And rightly so. As violence works both ways...either accept it completely or rule it out completely. No double standards.These stupid female super heros for the sake of female super heros are being forced on us and it's just rediculous. I among others don't even watch them but silently wait for the next female to think she can bring the pain....it'll be another rude awakening for those females that have placed their trust in films like this Capatain Marvel.Size and strength matters 60 percent of the time, coupled with testosterone and aggression and it's no match. It'll be like Serena Williams playing Rafael Nadal. A simple walk over even though. Serena is the greatest female in her profession. There is a line and it must be adhered to.....for the safety of this new generation of woke girls.",2,0,8,15 January 2020
Us," Not a good movie!! Poor.
","Ok, so everyone is getting carried away with Jordan Peele a bit, for what??? Neither of his movies are that good. The acting in US was good and the actors and actresses did what they could with an overrated script and just a jumble of Mr Peeles own thoughts that unfortunately he couldn't get across on film. I think he overestimates his own intelligence and needs to sit down and reevaluate. And even though it had mild violence and some smattering of blood this is not a horror movie. It provided no tension, no uneasiness, no scares at all and no fear of what's coming next. Waste of 17 bucks for my ticket.Poor effort!!!!",6,1,6,31 March 2019
Interstellar," Good movie but Ann Hathaway is a terrible actress
",Why on earth did anyone ever think this ugly actress should be forced upon us on screen. She is a terrible actress and we have been conned into thinking she was ever anything but.The movis is not bad....slightly overrated. Why is it that women always have to cry in movies and in life. I think that women can be equally as string as men and we have to show them as blubbering idiots. This needs to stop cos there is only one thing worse than an ugly woman on screen and that is the same ugly woman crying.So many things wrong with the proposed concept of this movie. But it was entertaining even if it's science seemed way off.,7,0,4,25 July 2019
Climax," Amazing movie .... Just amazing
","One of the best descents into hell you can imagine and so well done. From the opening dance scene to the pure chaos in the last act this is a purely genius movie.
Can't say anymore.",8,1,6,8 November 2019
Joker," Fantastically amazing
",The Joker represents everything people feel against the system in real and this movie is a perfect portrait of that feeling.As usual Joaquim Pheonix performs perfectly and his unique talent brings the Joker to life.Hope there is a sequel,8,0,1,10 November 2019
Da 5 Bloods," I'm a massive movie fan or all kinds of movies BUT
","I have to say, spike lee is overrated. There is something that is just not that good and he is given more credit than he deserves. I don't know if it's cos he is non white and therefore we tend to give them the benefit of the doubt to make sure it's seem like diversity is working but I'm basing this on talent and he just doesn't have consistently. This movie could of been great but he was out of his depth and I think that's because we expect a black man to be able to tell black stories - he failed here.",4,18,43,12 June 2020
