Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," It was bad, really really really bad...
","I can't remember the last time I felt so sick after watching a movie. I can't even believe people actually think this movie is 'funny'. It's just one bathroom situation after another. The plot is completely dull and boring, not to mention crass.Sure, it has say a couple 'amusing' moments, but they are completely overshadowed by relentless disgusting (and quite disturbing) elements in it. Don't waste your money! I know it's gotten rave reviews. That's why I wanted to see it originally. But after you see it, you wish you hadn't. I don't know what more I could say.Oh yes, this movie should have never been made.",1,4,9,11 August 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," The best movie this year by far...
","This is the best action movie I've seen in a while. Matt Damon gives a hell of a performance as super spy Jason Bourne. After one deadly confrontation after another, we can't help but sympathize with his relentless search to find out who he really is.Bourne travels from one point of the globe to the other trying to connect the pieces of his past together. Meanwhile, being pursued by assassins and trying to stay alive. There are suspenseful eye-popping action sequences that constantly hold your attention.The Bourne Ultimatum is definitely the summer blockbuster everyone should see. It doesn't get any better than this.",10,0,1,11 August 2007
The Dark Knight," I'm not wearing Hockey pads!!!!!!
","The Dark Knight is AWESOME...I couldn't blink for the entire 2 and a half hours. The non-stop action, compelling storyline, and above all, an incredibly surreal performance by Heath Ledger left me in awe the entire time. Christopher Nolan has not only shattered any standard set by previous superhero movies, but has brought us a movie-going experience unlike any other before.The Dark Knight seems to have been given a lot of careful thought. The scenes seem to flow very smoothly from one to another. The strong portrayals by all of the main characters add interesting individual touches to the overall film.The Dark Knight begs for an encore when the credits start rolling. It leaves all other superhero movies in the dust.",10,5,12,30 August 2008
