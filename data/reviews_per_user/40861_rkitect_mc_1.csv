Hereditary," So much potential, ultimately disappointing!
","Can't say much more than I have said above.......astonished that Toni Collette and Gabriel Byrne wasted their immense talent on this garbage! Not that it was poor all the way through, it had some intense moments but it just descends into farcical nonsense culminating in one of the worst endings to a movie I have ever seen. Not worth your time!",3,1,3,26 October 2018
