First Man," Great movie. The actual moon landing almost made me cry. (Very minor spoilers)
","Apollo 13 was great. So was this movie. It is a movie about the space program and about the hardships that the astronauts faced and about Neil as a person. The actual moon landing was supposed to be a climax. It is indeed a climax. I felt I was there. Exciting, dramatic and also a history lesson.",10,4,14,12 October 2018
The Day After Tomorrow," Best Emmerich movie I've seen!
","I enjoyed Independence Day and Godzilla - the only Emmerich movies I have seen. This one was even better.We have seen the trailers I don't know how many times and I was afraid that there would be nothing more to see in the actual film. I was wrong. There is a lot more.The suspense builds up nicely, the special effects are great and what you see is truly spectacular.In movies like this it often happens that the effects become the main thing and that the characters aren't developed. This was not the case with this movie. We get to know main characters and we care about them.
Another positive point about Day After Tomorrow: it has no violence, no sex and no foul language and is still very enjoyable.I have a feeling this is going to be a big box office hit.",Null,0,0,13 May 2004
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Spectacular!
","Nr 1 was spectacular. This one was SPECTACULAR with capital letters. It felt like 5 hrs but not because it was boring. Oh no, on the contrary. It felt longer because there simply was so much going on. Just like in the old Republic serials there seemed to be a spectacular action scene almost every 5 minutes. I may be wrong, but I wonder if this one even had almost as much action as the 3 LOTR movies taken together. The rest was magnificent, too. The characters, sets and locations etc. I just can't understand HOW they could pull off something as spectacular as this. There should be limits to what you can achieve - but maybe there aren't",10,10,28,11 December 2013
Ben-Hur," THE film
","Together with The ten commandments (1956), this is THE film. It has everything: story, sceneries, drama, message, the greatest action scene ever filmed (the race) and even a humorous scene. I have watched it 16 times and will absolutely watch it another 16 times. You never get bored with this movie. Unfortunatley, it shouldn't be seen on a small video screen - where you usually watch it nowadays.",Null,2,5,12 May 2000
Gladiator," 10+ (out of 10)
","I have waited for this movie almost a year. It's easy to be disappointed then. I was not. I have seen the movie twice, and will see it again.Actually, we have seen it all before: We saw Titanic go down in many movies, but never as realistically as in the movie from 1997. We saw D-day in The Longest Day, but when we saw Saving Pvt. Ryan in 1998 we felt we were there. We have seen gladiators fight and ancient Rome hundreds of times, but this was something different. Why? Because of the possibilities of modern technique. You actually felt you could almost smell what you saw.But Gladiator wasn't just special effects - it was a dramatic story as well.Ridley Scott, I thank you for bringing back the genre I love so much, the historical epic. Let's hope the era for these films starts again.There is only one bad thing with this film: it will lose very much on the small TV screen. See it on the big screen while you can!",Null,0,0,25 May 2000
