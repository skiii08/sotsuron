Requiem for a Dream," Stunning and frightening movie
","Beginning and middle of the film were interesting, but I felt almost nothing. Then it came to an end and all the emotions came down hard on me at that moment. Frightening and unexpected. I remained stunned. I stayed awake all night, I could not sleep. Because of the shock I guess. But already the next morning I was glad I watched it. There is no chance that I will ever use drugs after these scenes. After i saw Harry's infected arm. And doctors treating his mother with electroconvulsives. And loneliness of the characters. I recommend this movie to anyone. It brings up strong feelings and it makes you think about life and its meaning.",10,1,2,13 March 2011
