Hereditary," GO SEE THIS MOVIE
",This movie is so smart and thought out. The best horror movies I have ever seen. With a smart ending. This movie was so unpredictable that it was just insane. There was one moment that made my jaw drop and my jaw was dropped for at least 5 minutes after that. To many chills. GO SEE THIS MOVIE.,10,6,17,8 June 2018
A Quiet Place," Scary - kinda, good - hell yes
","If you are going to this movie to be scared up and down and back and forth then you best rethink going to see this movie. But if you want a very solid movie that is fun and gets the blood pumping, go see this movie. The concept of this movie is great. The end made me happy even with sad events that happened seconds before. All in all, it was genius.",9,1,3,7 April 2018
Midsommar," The pursuit of happiness
",I went into this movie expecting nothing. The first 10 minutes made my skin crawl and I knew that the rest was going to be interesting and maybe lead to something good. It got disturbing. VERY DISTURBING. I anticipated everything that was going to happen and I don't know if that is a good or bad thing. The anticipation felt normal with all the foreshadowing Ari gives us. Yet it was the weirdest thing I have ever seen but yet I feel like I enjoyed it. I have never felt so terrible about a film and yet think it was good. I don't know if that makes sense but if you watch it you might feel the same way. I can tell you it looks amazing though. The story and just everything that happens I am so confused and indifferent about that it just baffles me. Do I like this movie or not. The reason I'm giving it a good rating is that because immediately after I thought that was just god awful but as I thought about it it just brought chills all through my body. That's the point right? Go see this movie and maybe you will understand how I feel. No movie has made me felt this way. I wouldn't watch it again but I need others to see it so i can understand how I'm supposed to feel. This review is all over the place exactly like my thoughts on this movie. God damnit.,9,13,20,3 July 2019
