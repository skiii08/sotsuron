Catch Me If You Can," Never a Dull Moment
","Catch Me If You Can hits all the right notes with its involved characters, fast paced story, and thrilling capture of history. It's a true story but you wouldn't know it from its high entertainment value complete with a mix of comedy, drama, and suspense.Tom Hanks comes through again as the detective hot on Leonardo DiCaprio's trail. Both have a great on screen bond which makes the story even more touching.This is really a great movie for many reasons. But judge it for yourself. Spielberg has done it again with Catch Me If You Can. Nicely done. 8/10",8,2,4,2 January 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A Great Film
","This movie is fun for the whole family.  Rather than go into detail, I'll just say that it was spectacular.  The battle scenes were amazing and loaded with special effects.  Although the movie is long, it was action packed and very entertaining from start to finish.  The only downside is that we have to wait another year for part 2 and yet another year for part 3.  Overall the movie was great, and was definitely worth going to the theater and seeing.  And I'll bet the DVD is going to be a hot seller loaded with special features.  Just see the movie, it's fun for all ages.",8,0,0,16 February 2002
Cast Away," Excellent
",This movie is great from start to finish.  The style and mood of Cast Away is almost perfect.  Tom Hanks gives another huge performance.  And it doesn't get boring watching it the second or third time.  Certainly one of the best.  9/10,9,0,0,18 April 2003
Reservoir Dogs," Major Letdown
","I heard so many good things about this movie before I finally saw it, and I was misled. With a shorter running time, it seemed like there was an attempt to pack in a vast amount of plot, but it ended up seeming like more time was wasted because of it.With such a fine cast, I was expecting some fine performances. I wasn't disappointed as far as that goes. I'll admit the variety of characters was interesting and fun to watch at times, most notably during the first scene. That's about all it has to offer though.The basic concept of strangers getting together for a crime isn't a bad idea on paper, it just didn't work out at all for this script. I kept hoping the writing would get better as the movie went on, but after about a third of the way through, I knew what I was in for.I really don't think there's anything groundbreaking here, even for 1992. Crime movies have been done, and been done better. This seemed more like a fantasy crime movie that would only be interesting to the person thinking about it in their own unique way.There's also some torture scene put in, which I really thought didn't need to be. It didn't seem like it fit in, at least to the extent of what happened. So what's the bottom line here? Well, it's crime movie with a semi interesting plot, a lot of tough guy talk, and an overall letdown of what could have been. 4/10",4,7,13,12 January 2007
