The New World," no no no
","this was one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. it it not a piece of art at all, just boring...... whats art about filming the woods with sad words in the background for the 2nd movie in a row?? the director just points out the best parts of the Thin Red Line and tries to overcome them by adding even longer and used scenes! I loved the Thin Red Line, but this is just a copy of that wonderful movie, Malick is just trying to impress everyone by making a 'more fantastic' movie. almost everyone in the cinema where laughing of most of the scenes and everyone was relieved when the movie was finished, and it was a LOT of peoples, swearing and laughing! try making something original the next time.........",1,15,24,23 May 2006
