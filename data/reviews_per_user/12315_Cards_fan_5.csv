The Incredible Hulk," Not 'incredible', but very entertaining
","Coming off the 'incredible' 'Iron Man', Marvel Comics produces 'The Incredible Hulk'. Unfortunately, 'incredible' is a slight exaggeration. Don't get me wrong, it's an entertaining film; far more than the 2003 'Hulk' film which tended to take itself too seriously. This is the Hulk. Hulk smash should be the top priority of a Hulk film. For this reason, this film is a reboot rather than a sequel to the 2003 film. The Hulk's origin is told through still photos and captions during the opening credits and this origin tends to echo more of the TV show than either the comics (gamma bomb exposure) or the previous film (a convoluted mess). The CGI seemed a little sub par. At times I felt I was watching a cartoon. At least they rendered the Hulk a darker tone instead of the Shrek coloured green from the previous film. I suspect it will look better on the small screen. Comic fans will likely enjoy the loads of references to Marvel Comics characters, most notably, Captain America's super soldier formula. The film boasts an 'incredible' cast and everyone does a more than adequate job. I look forward to seeing what Marvel can do with their next project, Thor.",9,2,4,19 June 2008
Cloverfield," So so (possible spoilers)
","The film 'Cloverfield' seems to have a polarizing affect on most; people tend to love or hate it. Reading through the comments and reviews the past week, it seems that a lot of the folks who love it made up their mind before they even saw it. The folks who hate it all seem to list the same reasons such as the motion of the hand held camera, the ending, the lack of any sort of exposition, or elements they found improbable (i.e. surviving a helicopter crash, the battery life of the camcorder, or the survival of the video after the bombing). I didn't have a problem suspending disbelief for most of the film. I found most of it quite believable save for one element. The character Hud is videotaping the exploit because he feels it is important and people will need to see it later. This makes sense. The movie took place over a 7 to 9 hour period with Hud turning the camera off and on during this period and actually only recording less than 90 minutes of the experience. Apparently, nothing important happens at any time when the camera is shut off and the camera is shut off 90% of the time. And the camera is always on BEFORE something important to the story happens. I found this form of narrative extremely forced and felt it didn't work. Although I appreciate the effort to try something different, it isn't really original as it had been done in 'Blair Witch Project'. On the other hand, I found the novel way they mixed what was already recorded on the tape and the events being recorded over it to be extremely clever and interesting. That's the highest praise I can give the film, though. I thought most of it was a little dull and, being a fan of the genre, was really disappointed with it. It's understandable how the ending frustrates so many but most will realize how it will end at the beginning of the movie. So I'm one of the few who neither hated it or loved it. It's somewhere in the middle.",5,2,4,24 January 2008
Silent Hill," Utterly awful
","I started watching 'Silent Hill' on cable tonight and after half an hour I was completely amazed how utterly awful and unbelievable it was. I came to IMDb for some explanation for the character's actions and got my answer; it's based on a video game. I read many of the reviews and was quite surprise that there are actually people who like this film. It quickly became apparent that everyone who did like it was a fan of the game. Apparently, if you are a geeky fan boy who spends their spare time playing video games and want to watch a game re-created in movie form; you will probably enjoy this movie. If you want a sensible plot with interesting characters with credible motivations; you will recognize it for what it truly is.",1,3,7,16 August 2007
Hot Rod," This film was so bad...
","I got up and walked out. And I saw it on an airplane. OK, I didn't literally walk out, but I unplugged the head phones and stopped watching. Sitting in total boredom during the flight was preferable to this feeble attempt at a film. I had just seen the predictably asinine romantic comedy 'License to Wed' on a flight the week before and thought that it couldn't get any worse than that. It most certainly did with 'Hot Rod'. Amateurish best describes the film. It looks like what a film might look like if a group of high school kids got together and made a movie. I stopped watching after about 30 minutes and there was nothing even remotely humorous in that time. Based on the silence on the plane and comments from the few who actually listened to the entire film, nobody else on the flight found anything amusing either. The rave reviews found here for a film so obviously flawed and deficient are extremely suspicious. I suspect many of the reviewers are the same person, likely involved in the film. Check the reviewers history and see how many have never written another review for the answer. The rest are mind dead teens who think 'Snakes on a Plane' was a great film.",1,20,60,6 November 2007
Music and Lyrics," Above average romantic comedy
","Romantic comedies are, by nature, formulaic predictable fluff. 'Music and Lyrics' is no exception. Guy meets girl, guy loses girl, guy gets girl. That's the plot. What makes this film better than most in the genre are likable characters performed by amiable actors in a story that doesn't feel forced with enough funny smart gags to keep you entertained. Particularly amusing was the mock '80s music video that opened the film. Grant and Barrymore turn in their usual likable performances as leads Alex, a former '80s pop star, and Sophie, his protégé lyricist. Brad Garret does a wonderful job as Alex's manager. Who really stole the show, however, was '3rd Rock' actress Kristen Johnston as Sophie's older sister. Fans of the genre should seek this one out.",7,0,0,16 February 2008
