Mission: Impossible III," Brilliantly Made
","I must say i really enjoyed this film. It gave itself a sensible and realistic plot without trying to be too in depth to the point where the audience is not interested.It takes so many twists and turns that I myself was not expecting, nor were my friend who saw it with me.The action is constant and keeps getting better and better as the film goes on.The characters are amazing. Hoffman's character was great because you never quite know what he's thinking, giving his character a sort of mysterious feel, and brutal as well. The addition of Simon Pegg to the film makes it all the more better. And Tom Cruise does a fantastic job, as do all the actors.I have no real complaint about the film. I liked how it began, how it ran, and i loved the ending. I liked how Hoffman's character was ultimately dealt with, because i didn't see it coming, and it wasn't over the top.",10,0,1,30 July 2006
The Butterfly Effect," This is one of the greatest movies ever
","This film is the only movie I've seen this year that I actualy considered my favorite movie for a while.  It has a very negative and dark feeling to it, and you will not be able to stop thinking about it.  The Plot is undiscribibly brilliant, and it doesn't reveal and elements untill it first happens.  Do you know the feeling you get when you are about to go on a roller coster for the first time?  Imaging that awsome feeling for the whole length of the film, and about a week after it.  It has a lot of sad points, and parts where you will be left wide-eyed.  The acting is probably the best acting you will be able to see in a while, Ashton Kutcher may very well have a career in Both Comedy, and Thriller movies.  If you go there, to the theater, and decide to see it, there are only two opinions that you will have about it, you will either really hate it, or really love it, there are only 3 people that i know that thought the movie was so-so, and pretty much everyone else except my friend that has very bad taste in movies, loved it.",Null,1,2,3 April 2004
