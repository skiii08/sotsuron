Requiem for a Dream," This movie broke my heart.
","This is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. The story was interesting and I think that it is one of the topics that are extremely hard to express visually so my expectations were low. But the depictions of head trips and hallucinations were perfect. Also the quality of acting was quite high. I think that the storyline was a bit too pessimistic though and I think that there were several glitches. The sexual humiliation of Marion was not too realistic looking at the size of the device and that game that the two girls including the first timer Marion were forced to perform. Also there was a secret message of hate against black people stemming from the way Big Tim abused 'Maid Marion'. Also I could not understand why the main character kept injecting the heroine in his gangrene arm. Apart from that, it was one of the best movies that I have seen.",9,5,9,26 February 2006
