Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Kinda underrated, definitely not the worst movie ever.
","A lot of people say this is the worst star wars movie which I do disagree. I don't think it is as good as the original trilogy but there is still fun to be had. The practical effects and some CGI still hold up but there are some parts in the movie where they look bad. There's also two cringy jokes that are straight up embarrassing. Other than that, I was entertained enough to sit through the whole thing without having pause breaks in between. The characters and action are great. The plot wasn't that confusing but the audio commentary explains how Palpatine's plan is to gain power (which he will win either way by using the separatists or the queen). The yoda puppet did look weird but I don't like how they just lazily have cgi yoda, it might look better but it doesn't feel real. Still a fun movie to watch.",8,1,1,30 June 2020
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," My least favorite out of the george lucas SW films.
","I actually like the original trilogy + episodes 1 and 3. So me to say this film is bad can be surprising. People say this film is better than episode 1 which I have always HUGELY disagreed. This film is a big step down from TPM. This film is very slow and boring that I've only been able to watch this in one sitting TWICE. All the other times I would only watch the other half the next day. I used to absolutely hate this film but after rewatching it, it is bad but still is very disappointing. The lightsaber fight is terrible and really serves no purpose other than mild entertainment in between, I don't have a problem with yoda using a lightsaber but I do have a problem with nothing even being affected by it as in no loser or even winner. There is no reason for the jedi to let dooku go besides them being weak (even tho yoda isn't at all). One of the good things I did like is Jango Fett, i thought he was very cool and interesting along with the planet he was on. The clone troopers being CGI is really annoying imo since they were able to have real storm troopers but not real clone troopers? Sure I understand some points where they need CGI because it's impossible to have millions of them but there is no reason for them to be fake when it's just standard conversation. Not the worst movie ever but it even does go so bad that it's good a few times (mostly with Anakin and his acting.)",6,0,0,30 June 2020
Alien vs. Predator," Another good fanfic.
","Not as good as Freddy Vs Jason but I was still able to have fun with it. What holds a movie down to a 9 instead of a 10 is how the human characters aren't that good or memorable and some of the cgi is kind of bad. It's very fast paced and does have some great kills (even for a PG-13 movie), just expect alien and predator gore instead of human gore. This movie still has its own charm and there is lots of fun to be had. Predalien looks great but I think a sequel to a fanfic wasn't needed.",9,1,1,2 July 2020
Ghost Rider," Eh, seen better.
","Compared to some other superhero movies, this just seems bland and not that good. I mean sure it gives the origin story of ghost rider but it does nothing else other than that to make it a fun movie. Sure they made Ghost Rider intimidating and cool I guess? The CGI for him isn't that bad but it's just bland with little fun had, Nicholas Cage is alright tho.",5,0,0,24 June 2020
Transformers," Absolutely amazing.
","I reviewed this before but some of my opinions have changed and I've become to appreciate it more. The greatly paced and remains entertaining no matter what is happening, the score and music used is great, the action and robot fights are the best thing about this movie (My personal favorite is Optimus Prime vs Bonecrusher), the characters are tolerable and memorable but nothing too special except the acting is great and the characters feel natural including the robots. Only problem I have is there is a bit too many subplots (at least 3 different ones) but they tie them in together nicely enough to not distract you. The humor isn't bad but I wouldn't say every person would die laughing at every joke, some of the jokes are funny because of how weird they are tho. This still remains the best out of all the 5 (or 6 if u include bumblebee) films. The special effects also still hold up today really well. Tons of fun to be had here.",9,1,1,3 July 2020
Thor," Actually pretty good.
","Thor is not one of my favorite characters but this movie was really good. I like the character arch Thor has and how Thor's behavior is different from normal human beings. The humor is actually pretty good along with the action scenes. Not very complex, easy to follow along and get entertained.",8,1,1,28 June 2020
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Really not the worst movie ever.
","Don't get me wrong, I don't think it's a masterpiece but there are some good stuff that people ignore. My main issues are the movie literally reusing scenes from its own series and own movie which I think is incredibly lazy. My second issue is the comedy mostly ranges from bad to embarrassingly awful and a lot of stuff are a bit too sexualized. Some of the plot holes people point out can be easily figured out by paying attention to the movies plus the twins honestly don't bother me that much (if they do, I completely understand why but I've seen much worse). The CGI is still great and the work on Devastator should get some credit (they had to use multiple computers to render him). I like the sound track here as well since it fits the summer atmosphere that this movie is trying to give. I like the additions of soundwave (although he does more in the next movie), sideswipe, devastator, ravage, long haul, mixmaster, demolisher, jetfire and the fallen himself. The intro is also really good and I prefer it over the one in the first movie (however to be far they are both still good). The pacing is a bit slower than the first movie but I was still able to pay attention and watch the movie without being bored since the human story and transformers story are both linked together. The forest fight is the big highlight and even people who don't like this movie can agree that it's the best thing about this movie. I also liked the last fight with jet-powered prime as well even if it was a little bit too short but prime is also more powerful so that should explain why it's shorter than a normal prime fight. Overall, it isn't as good as the first movie but it isn't complete garbage as many people make it out to be and it might have been better if there wasn't a writers strike going on.",8,1,1,3 July 2020
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Best one in the prequel trilogy.
","Out of all the prequels, this is definitely the best one. It's a big improvement over Episode one and especially Episode 2. There's a lot of fun here, so many important scenes are in this movie. Only problems here are how the birth of luke and lea doesn't follow ROTJ as Padme died of child birth but other than that, this is a lot of fun. The music and characters are great along with the action provided. If there was one prequel that i could only watch then it would be this one.",9,1,1,30 June 2020
The Purge," I've seen worse but could have been WAYY better.
","The film isn't bad but I'd be stretching it if I said it was good. The highest that I can call the film would be 'mediocre' and that's me being generous. Some of the writing is pretty stupid (like the random betrayal on stuff that was literally never mentioned or foreshadowed and only there to increase the runtime), the film feels so small as it only takes place in one location and only two factions shown in the movie. I do have to admit the last 40 or 30 minutes are pretty entertaining tho.",6,0,0,30 June 2020
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Should have ended here.
","Sometimes I think this is the weakest out of the three and sometimes I think its as good as ROTF. My main problems with this movie is the pacing being very slow compared to the first two movies along with the human story and transformers story not linking up as well. The story however is the best out of all of them. The first movie's story is very simple and the second movie's story needs some explaining to understand it. There are only two additions that I like, that being sentinel prime, laserbeak, and shockwave. Megatron doesn't serve that much purpose in this movie and feels like a starscream to sentinel. There are some great action scenes as well but i feel like its more than half of the time surrounded on humans. Somehow Barricade is in this movie but never was shown or mentioned in ROTF. Sentinel was a pretty great villain with some good motives and Shockwave was pretty powerful and was just as amazing as sentinel. The editing is sometimes weird and even the soundtrack isn't as good as the first two movies. With the death of ironhide, megatron, starscream, and the trust shared between the autobots and humans shaken, the series should have perfectly ended here.",8,0,0,3 July 2020
