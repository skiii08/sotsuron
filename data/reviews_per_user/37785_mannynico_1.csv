Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Great humor
","If you are uptight and more than likely extreme right wing you will find this movie disgusting, so if you are one of those uptight annoying Homo sapiens, don't bother and go watch O'Reilly. But to the rest of the best and smartest, those that can take it like a man or woman; you will die laughing all throughout.Sacha Baron Cohen is by far one of our most gifted comedians of our time. Characters like Bruno and Ali G are examples of his humor. He bashes all stereotypes, which is great to see, in this PC boring world we now live in. It is great to encounter comedians that have no fear of others point of view. The fact he can go face to face with random people from all walks of life and make fun at them right on their face is amazing in today's world where everyone is so scared of not saying the right words.",10,4,12,11 June 2007
