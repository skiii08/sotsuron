Source Code," Thrillers as well written, acted and shot as this are rare.
","Saw it on its opening day, yesterday and have to say it is one of the relatively few recent films that I want to own on Blu-Ray to watch over and over.This is all spoiler free, so you'll be kept in the dark as you watch - best way; so please don't read too many reviews lest some surprises are revealed. The film looks great and has some lovely aerial shots; the acting is top notch from all concerned. It's quite refreshing when, in what is afterall an action movie, the producers and director have been able to cast people who can say so much about their individual characters by the slightest of looks or ways of moving or keeping still. I'm not a massive fan of Jake G's movies, but in this he really shows his acting abilities. There is one scene where he really gets everyone sniffling just by raising his eyebrows.There are some logical flaws, but as with anything fantastical, you've just got to accept the briefly described premise and run with it. So, sit back for the beginning and enjoy - because you'll soon be sitting upright as the story and events draw you in. You find out stuff at the same pace the main characters do, and that's quite enjoyable. You'll be lulled into thinking you know what comes next, or what is actually ir/relevant. But then sit forward with the rest of the audience as events unfold. It's a short film at approximately 93 minutes; I'd have liked more time with some of the train passengers, but as mentioned earlier, these actors do wonders with the little screen time they have. I always think it's a mark of good writing when I end up considering and caring about what a character is doing when off stage/screen and what their motivations are.A famous director once said that Groundhog Day was a masterclass in how to show repeated actions and events, yet keep them fresh. That happens here too. The style of story and storytelling of many favourite movies went through my mind as I watched, yet I never felt Source Code ripped them off: Groundhog Day, obviously, but also Bourne Supremacy, Mission Impossible, Quantum Leap and (elements of) The Jackall.Music is used cleverly and they give you visual hints and throwaway shots that later make sense. There is a feeling that you think you can see the end coming, but trust me, you could be wrong...They get the repetitive quotient right and for that reason I liked it more than the effects laden and overly dream layered Inception.A great thriller with twists right to the very end. Duncan Jones is a great director to watch out for.",7,0,2,2 April 2011
