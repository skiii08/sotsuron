Vertigo," Disappointed in the Disappointed
","More admissions: I have commented on this film before. My opinion has not changed, but it is consistently reinforced each time I read a comment criticizing an aspect of the film. You don't like it? Fair enough. I hate a lot of movies. What makes me feel the urge to stand on my amateur film reviewer soapbox is when people who don't like the film try to justify their opinions by saying something was done wrong in the filmmaking. Sorry, I'll say it again, the subjective views may all differ, but objectively speaking, there are no technical or logical flaws in the film that I have caught in the 40 or so times I've seen this (save for the one unresolved eccentricity I saw pointed out in an earlier comment with regard to the bizarre old lady at the McKittrick Hotel. Nevertheless, I see this as another Hitchcock Macguffin, or red herring, that need not necessarily be resolved in order to seal an already cohesive plot. But...I digress). Since my last review, I have read more pans of Kim Novak's acting, which are misguided. She is an actress, who in the film, plays a smalltown woman, who is coerced into an acting job. Therefore, a slick and subtle performance at all times would be out of place. Think this is too long? That the silent scenes of Scottie trailing Madeline are cutting room floor shots that snuck in due to careless editing? Yeah, sure, but they also create an internalized story, bringing the true focus to the emotional and psychological work that goes into the detective's life. It sets a mood, for lack of a more poetic term, that remains one of Hitchcock's best techniques: uncertainty.I shrieked out loud (serves me right for doing this at work) when I read the phrase 'worthy of a B Movie' in reference to Scottie's (pardon the paraphrasing) sudden falling out of love with the woman who ruined his life and put him in an asylum. There was nothing in the movie's conclusion that suggested Scottie had fallen out of love with Madeline. This is a man who has found out that the great tragedy of his life was no accident, but the result of careful conspiracy, among the instigators being the woman he loved. If there is something campy about going crazy after losing your deepest love to suicide (or so you think) and being largely blamed afterward (I reference the post-fall courtroom scene), it is lost on me. If the B Movie hokiness cited earlier was with regard to Scottie getting a little frustrated with Judy when he found out she done him wrong, I still fail to see the point. We've watched the guy embark down an insanity spiral for 2 hours by that point; it fits perfectly. Plus, on a side note, Kim Novak could probably have worked all 86 fabulous pounds of Jimmy Stewart in a fight. This is about moral decay, about how love can be truly blinding (blinding, as in, not being able to clearly see brilliant cinematic triumph, wink wink), and obsessions. The rest is incidental information used to make a beautiful if utterly dark story; the horrifying ending only serves to make the love story and its evanescence more haunting and poignant. Some of us have obsessions, and they make us a little goofy. I have one I'll confess, myself: 'Vertigo'.",Null,0,2,18 July 2002
Vertigo," ADD patients need not apply
","There is one reason to dislike this film. Okay there are several reasons, but they all stem from one essential characteristic:laziness. I have read some positively mind-boggling critiques of 'Vertigo' and all seem to illustrate nothing but the shallowness of the viewer who is not willing to devote the attention and time that Hitchcock requires of his audience. If you cannot sit still for two hours and eight minutes, if 'Bill and Ted's' was the best mental exercise you've endured in the cinematic world, yeah, you will have a problem with 'Vertigo'; you simply won't get it. I recognize that opinions are objective. My opinion that this is the single greatest film of all time is no exception. However, some things are objective, and I feel should be stated for the record, on behalf of those unfortunate enough to be swayed by some of the inconsistent, flawed criticisms offered here. Objective: All casting in this film was deliberate. I promise, no actor wandered into a frame and slipped past Hitchcock's eye, thus ruining his creative vision. Novak has received some criticism for playing her part with a lack of definition or confidence exemplified by revered hallmarks of the genre such as Katharine Hepburn. This is not because she doesn't know what she is doing. Her character is manipulated by the people around her and made a pawn. A bold performance would only undermine the heavy message of moral decay. I submit, she - in all her doubt, and conflicted insecurity - is perfect. I read a review that bemoaned the casting of Scottie for not being 'Jimmy Stewart-esque'. Good God, are you serious? What better figure than America's everyman to embody the broken spirit of a man taken over by fantasy un-checked? Cast anybody else, and the tragedy is instantly removed from the story because if even Jimmy Stewart is capable of falling into the moral downward spiral... Objective: This plot has no logical flaws. If you think it does, watch it again and you will see you missed something. Try me. Subjective: This is physically the most stunningly beautiful film ever made. Look at the Golden Gate towering over Madeline in all her emotional tininess, the Giant Redwoods cross-sectioned so as to belie the inconsequentiality of these two sinners over time and space, the Missions invoking the imagery of conquest and ethical shades of gray, gray like the San Francisco fog...But, I digress. Back to: Objective: This is a film about circles, spirals, and, ahem, Vertigo, if you will. Moral dizziness. Geographic roundabouts (they go all around San Francisco, up and down). Indecision, illustrated in the form of head-spinning torment. Last, the merry-go-round of the double. I would list all the pairs in this film, but I'm working with a word limit here. Suffice to say, this is the greatest conference of the doubles since that English guy did 'A Comedy of Errors'. Why the double? The existence of a double creates the possibility for a do-over (hence, recurrence as another Hitchcockian circle). But this is not 'Groundhog Day'.  Hitchcock's circuit is one of sealed fate. They do not learn, they just descend. What we have is a story concerned with falling and spinning. The metaphysical ghost world and existential agony of lost love intertwine in a realm made visible by the green lights of the Empire Hotel. Indeed we are left at the end with only a faint hope that upon transcending the spiral, the two lines may cross in a world un-governed by the rules of gravity. Getting to melodramatic for ya? Apologies, I too am subject to my obsessions and thus a little deterioration here and there.",Null,0,1,23 April 2002
