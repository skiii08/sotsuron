Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," An exceptionally funny movie
","Being a huge Borat fan, I went into the cinema with the highest of expectations. I was actually expecting to be let down by this feature film, but luckily Cohen kept the repetitions from his TV show on a very short leash - even avid admirers of his stunts will have a hard time not laughing, as he easily tops his previous endearments. As a matter of fact, the first hour is a non-stop laugh-fest: I have yet to see another movie that manages to blend slapstick & toilet humor as well as social criticism of the more degenerated states of America into a funny experience as this. Given, this movie doesn't even try to be PC, and part of the German audience was wincing during some of the stronger anti-Jewish jokes. But Borat, being Jewish himself, has no trouble at all with that - he generally just seems to promenade through the inadequacies and embarrassments of the North American societies. I cannot imagine the person that does not find this movie funny. I would go as far as to declare anyone not laughing at least thrice during the first half hour of the movie devoid of any humour. Yes, it is that good.",10,207,425,11 October 2006
