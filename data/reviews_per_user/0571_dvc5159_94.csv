The King's Speech," Splendid film where everything worked together... and well
","Watch out, Oscars: 'The Social Network' has found its rival.'The King's Speech' is an historic drama about King George VI and his attempts to get rid of his stutter, because how can a world leader, let alone one on the brink of war, lead a country without speaking properly? The film focuses on the methods that the King has to go through, set up by speech therapist Lionel Logue, and eventually a strong bond forms between them.Let me just start out by saying that Colin Firth is magnificent as the King and he is rightfully and thankfully winning all of the Best Actor awards right now because of this performance. Firth has always been an interesting actor who shows a lot of talent but showcases it in full here. His eyes and mannerisms display a variety of emotions from conflict to aggression and solemnity. It is a superb and memorable performance. Geoffrey Rush is also very strong as Logue and he excludes a classy aura around him while also giving a nuanced, witty performance. The chemistry between Firth and Rush is fantastic and the film is theirs with their presence alone. But let's not forget Helena Bonham Carter, who is the emotional core of the King, as she also exudes some care and affection towards the King in his time of need.The screenplay is masterfully written by David Siedler, full of sly British humor and wit, but not overly done to sacrifice the story and characters. The dialogue is fantastic, made even more great by the brilliant performances and extremely focused direction by Tom Hooper. The production design is beautiful with some nice outdoor locations and interiors of the British monarchy, the cinematography is perfectly framed with the faces of the actors treated like landscapes to get every emotion out of them, and the music by Alexandre Desplat is classy and exudes many emotions from liveliness to solemnity to finally grand.Two things I would like to add. One, is that everything, and I mean EVERYTHING in this movie worked. Because they all help each other out. The acting is made better by the screenplay and direction, which is also helped by the cinematography and music. All of these forces combine to craft one brilliant scene after another, transforming a simple story to a film worth watching many times to learn about friendship and perseverance.Secondly, the cinematography is quite unique: usually the camera will frame the actor looking to his right, on the right side of the screen; in this movie it is inverted, creating an unusual but effective method of capturing the actors' faces.Overall, I really can't say enough praise for this film, because it is a simple story that is magnificently and professionally told by a cast and crew that moves like clockwork and performs perfectly like a well-staged play. Kudos to everyone involved, and congratulations at the BAFTAs for hard work that is well-rewarded.Now come the Oscars to see which is truly the better film, for I am, for the first time, at a loss to see which movie will win, the Facebook movie, or the stuttering King? We shall see.Overall rating: 94/100",7,0,1,17 February 2011
Black Swan," Sublime. Sensual. Sinister. Superb.
","'Black Swan' opens with Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) performing as the White Swan, as the triumphant orchestra bellows behind her while the camera rotates around her frantically, to capture her elegance and grace. Minutes later, she awakens from her dream. She goes to a ballet academy in New York City to try out for the play 'The Black Swan', and hopefully win the lead part of the White Swan, but doing so also means that she will have to play the part of the Black Swan as well, the White Swan's evil twin.Such is the case in the latest drama by Darren Aronofsky, fast becoming one of the most sought-after and talented filmmakers of modern times. The film's tale of sought-after perfection and its consequences is a plot that, honestly, has been tried one too many times by many films, most of them used as family-friendly plot-lines by mainstream studios. Aronofsky, however, bravely shows the stark consequences of this, and boldly shows the raw consequence of perfection to its brutal honesty. We ask ourselves, eventually, should we work hard for what we want, or should we only strive for what we need? And should we go down that hard road, is it too late to turn back?With that, we come to our star, Natalie Portman, who delivers a tour-de-force performance, a career-making one as Nina. For an actress to play such a challenging role which requires a various cocktail of emotions, and for her to pull it off so brilliantly, it takes true, raw talent, and she commands every scene with her stark performance. It is a mesmerizing performance that will engage and floor those who see it.Coming to the other actors, Vincent Cassel is terrifically slimy yet charming as the artistic director who seduces Nina to bring her darker side out. His aggressive and fierce persona gave a lot of power to his character who (un)intentionally took Nina to a downward spiral. Mila Kunis, gorgeous as ever, exhibits a wild, youthful charge as Lily, as she constantly 'challenges' Nina she displays a sinister vibe to her character, and then back to being happy-go-lucky again. Barbara Hershey also strongly plays a character who shows hidden tendencies, and while not exaggerating it, Hershey underplays her character so well that it's near impossible to find out that she has issues concerning her daughter, at least during the first quarter of the film. Finally we have Winona Ryder, as Leroy's ex-lead Beth, disgruntled and angry at him for firing her and replacing her with Nina instead.Darren Aronofsky's usual crew returns here to work on the film, and they work wonders with what they have. Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz and John McLaughlin pen the screenplay with care and crafts a balanced and coherent tale. Using their script, the crew puts it to fantastic effect: Cinematographer Matthew Libatique captures the dancers by frenetically using his camera to follow the dancers from the backstage onto the stage itself, and then revolving around various dancers as they perform on the stage in order to thrust the audience directly into the action as an experience. Editor Andrew Weisblum paces the film accordingly without it being too fast or shot, and with some of the shots so perfectly placed together it makes the story better. Clint Mansell's music in the film is a brilliant piece of work. Production design and art direction utilizes full use of the State University of New York's Performing Arts Center at Purchase, from the ballerinas practicing to the main event during the film's exhilarating 20-minute finale.Lastly, there is Aronofsky himself, who crafts the film with a detailed eye and a strong visual sense. He knows how to utilize Libatique's camera and use it to bring out the full effect of the scene he's shooting, be it from the simplest of static shots to the complex choreography of the ballerinas. His huge passion and dedication to the film can be seen through the actors, and not just particularly though Portman herself.Darren Aronofsky continues to prove himself as a tour-de-force filmmaker who can make effective and engaging quality films, ever since his extremely depressing but superb magnum opus 'Requiem For A Dream' a decade ago. With 'Black Swan' he brought out the best in Natalie Portman, and continues his streak as one of the most brilliant directors working today. See this movie, and may the Academy reward Portman for her work. She deserves it. After graduating as a child star, and after a reasonably well career in between, Portman has grown into a beautiful young woman and a fantastic young actress, and this movie is the result of plenty of hard work over the years. Well done.Without a doubt one of 2010's very best films.Overall rating: 90/100",7,2,4,21 February 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," The funniest of the 'Pirates' films.
","Johnny Depp is back as Captain Jack Sparrow and here he gets the bulk of this fourth entry in the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' series. This is a great thing, because I was honestly getting tired of Will and Elizabeth's predicament in the previous two movies... and not enough Jack. I guess the producers thought so too, so we have more Jack Sparrow now in this movie that any other 'Pirates' before.I cannot imagine anyone other than Depp as Jack Sparrow. He's become sort of an iconic movie character, the heroic outlaw who can crack a joke in a time of danger or peril, that everyone loves and wants to be (sort of). He fights and moves in situations that Jackie Chan would be proud of. In short, he's a classic movie hero, and it's no different in this installment. Depp still gives his all despite the previous two movies colossal scale potentially tiring him of the role.However, Sparrow isn't the only one to crack a one-liner. Almost every major character, even the villains, have at least one very funny line. It's as if the screenwriters were having a breeze writing this installment. The beautiful and talented Penelope Cruz joins the franchise as Angelica, an old flame from Jack's past who seems to still want to either kill him or love him - it's nice to see Cruz lightening up from all those grueling dramas and have some fun on an adventure like this. Ian McShane as the villain Captian Blackbeard has a menacing atmosphere around him that makes him quite unsettling. And Geoffrey Rush returns as Barbossa, looking not too good since the last time we saw him, but nevertheless still as wily as ever. It seems his and Jacks' characters were reduced from mortal enemies from the first film to bickering rivals here. The chemistry between all of the actors are great.'Chicago' director Rob Marshall takes over Gore Verbinski for this installment. It's made clear during the sword-fighting sequences - they are well-choreographed and well-filmed as if it's some sort of musical. Marshall does his job well, as per the lavish production design, great camera work, good special effects (at times really pushing the PG-13 rating and Disney's family-friendly reputation at once) and grand music score by Hans Zimmer (who else?)However, the film suffers for three problems - One, the lack of character development for some of the characters who, admittedly, serve little purpose to the story whatsoever apart from making them potential comebacks for the next installment. Two, too choppy editing during the sword-fights. They are nearly incomprehensible to watch due to the fast cuts, and it ruins the good camera work and choreography and strips their adrenaline factor away. Three - said sword-fights and other action sequences were filmed too dark during the night scenes, something the 3D viewers will not appreciate (understatement). I saw this in 2D and that's good enough, you don't need an extra dimension to bring you into Jack's world.I found this more enjoyable than 'Dead Man's Chest' and 'At World's End'. The most lighthearted of the 'Pirates' films, this one was on a smaller scale, and had tons more humor than the previous two, and most notably more Captain Jack than ever before. See it for the laughs and Depp. Grab the popcorn and enjoy.I hope the action sequences are improved in the next installment, however.Overall rating: 68/100",6,2,4,20 May 2011
Sucker Punch," Zack Snyder lets his complete vision out... with mixed results
","'Sucker Punch' is a difficult movie to rate. It is targeted at young males who have a penchant for anime, video games, and hot young girls kicking ass. In other words, Zack Snyder's imagination and childhood fantasies are completely let loose here, with mixed results.First off, hats off to Zack Snyder. His world is completely warped. With this being his first original film (the previous others were all adaptations of other works), he unleashes an array of stimulating and sensational visual effects and action sequences the way he normally does so solidly.Secondly, anyone expecting proper characterization and a coherent story will walk out half-an-hour into the movie.The story may look stupid on the outside, and believe me it does, but after paying close attention I noticed a real psychological trait running throughout the entire film's duration. There are aspects which are metaphorical and will keep you guessing what is really happening throughout. Although the story is shaped in a very incoherent and unnatural way, it never fully reaches its potential and the psychological aspect pales in comparison with other brilliant films like Christopher Nolan's 'Memento' and 'Inception'.Thirdly, some of the material may be too dark for it's PG-13 rating, and there is no easy solutions to solve these dark themes. The change of tone between this and its fantasy theme is ultimately very jarring indeed and can cause a lot of viewers to be turned off.The action sequences, however are very stylized and extravagantly done. It is clear that a lot of thought has been put into the action. Snyder utilizes well-rendered computer-generated visual effects to great use, and the camera work and editing allow the audience to savor the effects and appreciate them. But there are times where the action becomes very overdone, and it drags on too loud and some scenes which have no purpose being there, thus bogging down the pacing too.The actresses look great and sexy, but in some scenes they show some surprising vulnerability beneath all of those good looks. The supporting cast is good too, most notably Oscar Isaac as the main villain, and it's nice to see Scott Glenn on the big screen again.My main gripe comes with the music and sound effects, sometimes they're obnoxiously loud and forced, and they make some moments look out of place in the film. Tyler Bates and Marius De Vries may have put a lot of combinations of music in this film, but sometimes one's got to know that too much of a good thing is bad.No doubt many people will hate this film. Also, not many people may notice the psychological aspect (it was only hinted at in the trailers) running throughout the film, making them think that it's an all out action-fantasy film instead of an action-adventure that takes place in the mind. The film's faults make this Zack Snyder's weakest film thus far, but it is still miles away from ever being called an abomination. The tagline is true, 'you will be unprepared', and as I enjoyed the visuals but was puzzled by the story and its resolution, I find this to be not just brainless entertainment on the surface. It may be Snyder's weakest, but it is nonetheless interesting.Perhaps this is a warm-up, or the release of Snyder's mind, to prepare him for that 'Superman' project with Christopher Nolan.Overall rating: 65/100",5,5,15,24 March 2011
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Hits home and then some
","Stephen Chbosky's 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' may not be an original film dealing with high school ups and downs, but it could very well be a very strong addition to the genre. It marks a great directorial debut from Chbosky, who also wrote the screenplay which is based on his own novel. It is always a pleasure to see an author/novelist have the freedom to express his own material in a different medium, and do it so professionally.The film centers around introvert Charlie and his struggles during freshman year in high school. Charlie is struggling with making new friends due to personal tragedies which affected him negatively. This may not be new, but in the hands of a lesser director, could make it worse. Chbosky knows what he is doing and fine-tunes his actors to fit his story the way he wants it - raw and real. True to introverts, this movie and Chbosky really get what they're thinking and how they can cope with friends, bullies and tragedies. Chbosky understood the themes and his actors understood the material very well, so this film is not the usual teen film. The three main actors shape themselves around their characters perfectly. Logan Lerman is great as Charlie in a performance that is emotional, subtle, withdrawn and quirky in places. He really can get intense at moments too. Ezra Miller, who terrified us in 'We Need To Talk About Kevin' last year, turns 180 degrees and delivers a likable, hilarious, often touching character in Patrick, who is half the key to Charlie's quest for friendship. The other half is the lovely Emma Watson as Sam, Patrick's stepsister and Charlie's first love. Watson, in her first attempt to shed off her 'Harry Potter' image is witty, charming and cute, and still manages to give out a heartfelt performance. She's the kind of pretty girl that all boys like to see, and give guys like Charlie hopes and dreams - and possibly save them, too. Other actors in the movie of note are Mae Whitman as Charlie's first date, Kate Walsh and Dylan McDermott as Charlie's parents and Nina Dobrev and Zane Holtz as Charlie's siblings. They sort of fade into the background once Charlie gets with his friends, but they're there when Charlie has no one, like all families should be. Oh, and Paul Rudd as the likable literature teacher. Makes you want him to be in your class one day.Chbosky does not stray from the roots of realism. Even though the film may tread familiar teen movie ground as desirable as it should, Chbosky firmly plants this movie's feet into the realistic ground. This film struck a personal chord with me, too. It really touched me as I am an introvert as well since high school, although not as serious and intense as Charlie, I feel him. Some scenes were pleasant to watch, some scenes were intense and brought back many unwanted/awkward memories, and other times it had me thinking even further.The fact that this film contains mature themes of suicide, homosexuality, drug and sexual content, and still be given a PG-13 rating is nothing short of a miracle. Bottom line is, if you're a teen or an introverted young adult, make sure this movie is on the top of your watch list. This is a great teen film.Overall: 84%",7,4,7,28 September 2012
The Expendables 2," Welcome back to the '80s
","It takes a certain mindset to appreciate a movie like 'The Expendables 2'. One has to be a fan of the action genre of the 1980s and early 1990s, as well as enjoying those action heroes' persona and screen presence whenever they appear on-screen. They did not necessarily have to act well, but they had to be tough, heroic, stoic, larger than life. Realism need not really apply here - it's all about the fun factor. People paid to see these guys blow away the scum of the earth as they only know how.'The Expendables 2' is the first sequel (and it most certainly would not be the last) to Stallone's 2010 surprise blockbuster which was intended as a glorious throwback to the films of that era. This one is no exception. However, it is a rare sequel which is better than the first. The story may not be important in these types of movies, but in this one the screenplay had a much clearer and stronger narrative than the first film, making it clear that the stakes are raised, thus enabling the story, however shallow, to be more engaging for the audience.Director Simon West ('Con Air') did wonders with the action sequences as he usually does with his movies. The majority of the action sequences are well shot with wide angles and much better stunt choreography (with CGI touches added here and there, but not as pervasive as the first film's CGI blood; good ol' squibs are used here mostly) which gets annoying with the film's rapid editing at times. Brian Tyler's music score was fairly engaging but didn't really stand out. Overall, the technical aspects of the film really shows off the big budget for the film, and it pays off ultimately.But what about the characters? If you've seen the director's cut for the first film, that's about as close as you can get for character development. Like the first, this is all-out action, but it has some dramatic moments too. There is a line about coping with death that Barney Ross mutters that feels kind of sad knowing Stallone's own real- life predicament. Van Damme's having a blast as the Villain, and a menacing one at that. The biggest disappointment was that of Jet Li's very minimal screen presence, like a cameo. Hopefully an extended version will fix that problem.The film's biggest entertainment value comes in the constant one-liners from and between the action icons of the eras, as well as their presence and their dispatching of the bad guys. The banter here is certainly more hilarious and less bland than the first film - there is much more chemistry between the characters. Their screen presence needs no explanation: Sylvester Stallone. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Bruce Willis. Jean-Claude Van Damme. Chuck Norris. Dolph Lundgren. Jason Statham. Jet Li. Need I say more? Cult or mainstream, these guys each has hordes of fans - and they have good reason to.I grew up on these types of movies and ultimately 'The Expendables 2' satisfies my craving for good old-fashioned movie bloodlust in wake of the ever-rising wave of PG-13, CGI-laden action films ('Total Recall' remake, anyone? Oh Arnie, where art thou?). That being said, I expect an extended director's cut as I feel that some parts were awkwardly put together, and hopefully these removed scenes will make the film better as a whole. For now, 'The Expendables 2' is very good entertainment, as shallow as it is technically well-made and ends the 2012 summer movie season with a big bang.Now bring on 'The Expendables 3' with Steven Seagal and Wesley Snipes (to basically complete the cycle of 80's/'90s action heroes). Mel Gibson, Kurt Russell, Harrison Ford, Nicolas Cage and Clint Eastwood (my #1 action hero) are also most welcome indeed.Overall rating: 65%Action movie rating: 75%",6,83,125,17 August 2012
Source Code," A very intriguing sci-fi concept..
","'Source Code' opens with a man who awakens in a train in front of a woman who apparently is his girlfriend. he then stumbles upon a mirror and finds that his reflection is different. While arguing with the passengers the train is blown up, killing everyone on board.The man wakes up in a metallic chamber of sorts. A screen lights up and shows a female officer debriefing him about his situation. It turns out that he is a soldier used in a revolutionary device known as the 'Source Code' which 'sends him back' to the time and place before the bombings. No - they do not want him to save the day, the events have already happened and they are using him to find out who did it and to stop them since they had planned it to be a series of attacks on the city.If the plot is anything to go by, 'Source Code' is an extremely entertaining thriller with the right amount of action, suspense, mystery and romance. It is also - a rarity for movies today - a blockbuster which also makes you think. Not at the same level of 'Inception', mind you - this is a totally different ball game. While not nearly as deep as 'Inception' or 'Blade Runner' the science fiction concept got me thinking for a while. This isn't a sci-fi classic, but it's close.As for the acting, Jake Gyllenhaal makes for a solid action lead with him balancing the emotions at the right time; Vera Farmiga is somewhat cold in the beginning as the officer in charge of Gyllenhaal's situation and Michelle Monaghan plays the clichéd love interest, but both do fairly well in their roles; but Jeffrey Wright is superb as the somewhat quirky/creepy scientist.As for the plot, some call it an amalgamation of 'Groundhog Day' and 'Deja Vu' with a heavy twist of 'The Matrix'. Call it as you like, but I found it intriguing - even bordering on 'hard' sci-fi, where done wrong it would be a disaster, however it is done right here; Wright's scientist character explains it all in a short but straightforward way that you will find it easy to understand and yet think whether this is possible or not. Preposterous? Maybe. Ingenious? Definitely.Production wise - the production design and art direction are good for what they can offer. The special effects - dodgy at times, fluid during others. The editing - good but somewhat hokey during the 'time travel' parts. Camera work - superb. You get to see everything that happens without a cameraman inflicted with Parkinsons'. The music is great by Chris Bacon - a fresh composer I've never heard of - whose music style reminisces of the glory days of the '80s/'90s orchestral action film scores by Jerry Goldsmith.This is director Duncan Jones' second feature film after the brilliant 'Moon' two years ago, and Ben Ripley's first mainstream screenplay after the back-to-back direct-to-video Species sequels. Jones and Ripley work wonders with the script, adding a huge sense of unpredictability and intelligence in an already smart script. Just when you think you've got it, there's a surprise after another. Jones keeps the film tight and taut, with the film's length of 90 minutes never holding back.My only gripe is with the ending, the film could've been a classic had it not been for a (somewhat) Hollywood ending, or if it had the final three minutes cut off, right after the still frame. It may get you thinking about whether it is real or not, though.In short, this is a very good, though not great, blockbuster, with some really neat thrills and ingenious twists, an intriguing sci-fi concept and some good performances that will reach out to the mainstream moviegoer, that could have been better. Hard sci-fi fans may finds this a tad too tame, but will appreciate Jones and Ripley for trying to bring back the genre one small step at a time.Overall rating: 77/100",7,1,2,8 April 2011
Skyfall," 'He knows how to make an entrance.'
","The most iconic film characters have dark beginnings. So is the case of Batman, and so it is with James Bond.'Skyfall' is the 23rd official James Bond film, and could very well be one of, if not the, best one. We've come a long way from 'Dr. No'. Yes, Craig is still mostly brooding and tough, his steely eyes and cold voice resonates throughout the movie, but he portrays the character the way Ian Fleming intended it. Not unlike Timothy Dalton, but Craig is leaner and meaner, although some scenes of dry wit and humor do indeed make the cut. In 'Skyfall' we explore his past and understand more why he has become the man he is.The stakes are raised much more. Javier Bardem portrays Raoul Silva, a computer hacker/ex-MI6 agent, and what could possibly the best Bond villain since, I dunno, Auric Goldfinger and/or Franz Sanchez. Bardem's Oscar-winning performance as Anton Chigurh terrified me, and shades of it can be seen in the midst of Silva, but with more flair and uncomfortable, flamboyant glee. His only flaw was not having more screen time in the film than he had.Judi Dench returns as M, the head of MI6. Unlike the previous six movies , M is given depth and resonance, played wonderfully and intensely by Dench that I actually cared for her and worried about the stakes at hand. You can see it in her that her past decisions have filled her up with guilt and she hides it all in despite her steely resolve, giving a new and fascinating depth to the character that will definitely make her more appreciated when I revisit the previous films. Along with Bardem, Dench steals every scene she's in with her superb acting qualities.Nothing much to say about the other characters. I was wondering why Naomi Harris was underused, and then at the end of the film it hit me why. Berenice Marlohe, a stunning, seriously seductive and sultry beauty in true Bond girl fashion, too is very underused. Ben Whishaw steps into the role of Q the quartermaster. He's no Desmond Llewellyn but he definitely has some deadpan wit in him. Oh, and Ralph Fiennes and Albert Finney (humorously) show up too.Now this is why the film may not fare well with most Bond films. The film is, for the first time in a Bond film, directed by an Oscar-winner, Sam Mendes ('American Beauty', 'Road to Perdition', 'Jarhead'). The screenplay was written by Bond regulars Neal Purvis and Robert Wade along with accomplished Oscar-nominated screenwriter John Logan ('Gladiator', 'The Last Samurai', 'The Aviator'). You can guess where this is going. EON Producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson did the right move hiring these crew of calibre.Because, the film alternates between being a James Bond action/adventure, and being a character-driven Sam Mendes drama. Most people will not stand for this. At 143 minutes (the longest in the franchise) it might seem tedious and too talky for those looking for globe-trotting escapades. But it worked superbly for me. This is the first Bond film where I truly cared for the important characters (007 and M; in Silva's case, dread) and their outcomes, and the decisions that define who they are and what they have become. This darker, more intense tone, I think, is probably inspired and influenced by Christopher Nolan's serious and brooding re-interpretation of Batman. I believe Mendes' strong, focused direction and the strong, well-thought out script by Purvis, Wade and Logan is to be credited for this. Yes, some plot points were kinda contrived, but Mendes' direction and the screen writing is so good, I forgive it for its flaws. I enjoy darker films too, so as long as the filmmakers know what they are doing.It's not to say the film is low on action. Far from it. Mendes has proved himself to be a capable man of action. From a high-octane chase through Istanbul to a struggle in between neon-lit skyscrapers in Shanghai, from a race against time in London, to a sensational, jaw-dropping and emotionally intense climax in the Scottish hillside, 'Skyfall' packs the thrills. And perfectly balances both it and the dramatics without either upstaging the other.Of course, credit goes to the ever reliable Stuart Baird and his daughter Kate for cutting and crisply pacing the dramatics and the action perfectly and smoothly. The cinematography by the gifted Roger Deakins is hauntingly beautiful and stunning in scenes and is shaky-free, capturing the action in all their epic glory (I saw this film in IMAX, and I have to say, just WOW).Last but not least, the music. British sensation Adele sings the title tune with her sultry voice, and it is a good song that is classic Bond. Series regular David Arnold does not return from this one, instead Mendes favorite and veteran Oscar-winning (there's that word again) composer Thomas Newman creates suitable themes for the sultry that would make John Barry proud, but when it comes to the action the music is engaging and Newman knows how to time it perfectly. It's the emotional and dramatic themes that strike a chord, though.Is 'Skyfall' everything I hoped for? Yes. And then some. I particularly loved how the writers and Mendes paid tribute to the classic Bond films. I did not expect it to be a searing character study as well. This film has brought James Bond back to life, no matter what anyone says. It's like getting to know your best friend's troubled past, yet respecting and still enjoying his tales for many more years to come. What Christopher Nolan did for Batman, Sam Mendes has certainly done the same for James Bond.A perfect film to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the EON James Bond films. Bond is back. And Craig is here to stay.Overall: 92%",8,10,19,8 November 2012
Resident Evil: Afterlife," I'm sorry, but exploiting 3D does not make entertainment.
","We live in a time where entertainment can be mindless fun. So as long as they do not try to be what they can't. Then it's good fun. 'Resident Evil: Afterlife' is not good fun. Why? Some say repetitive, others say it's boring, flat, dull and dark. Only when the action comes do we get some real 'cool' entertainment but that's it.Heavily inspired by 'The Matrix' the action sequences show no mercy in assaulting the senses. It's all there: slo-mo, bullet time, black sunglasses, lots and lots of bullets and slo-mo explosions, everything. Just add a few zombies to make sure they (the filmmakers) look like they're not ripping fans of the original games and film trilogy, and make it part of the franchise. Apparently they DO rip off the audience, there's very few zombie butt-kicking than in the previous three; save for that big brutal monster with the giant axe in the middle of the film which gives the film one of its pluses.There's virtually no story to speak of, just brief introductions to the next action sequence (and at the ending, an inevitable sequel to keep this dead horse running). Milla Jovovich looks good but she starting to look bored. Ali Larter, Boris Kodjoe and Wentworth Miller don't even bother about characterization apart from the fact that they look fit and hot. The cinematography, production design and visual effects are solid but the complementing music by Tomandandy is just too electronic and distracting. It's as if they're trying too hard to be hip.Speaking of trying too hard to be hip, the Matrix-inspired action has 3D to make it look even better. I'll admit, director Paul W.S. Anderson really jumped on the 3D bandwagon and put it to good use. The 3D is solid, with the bullets and blood and that giant axe all flying toward the screen and towards the audiences' faces.Which brings me to the question: why bother? 3D is meant for fantasy/sci-fi films with out-of-this-world situations. It does not fit in any action/horror film, and it is NOT supposed to be used as a gimmick. People don't go to the movies to see the 3D as advertised; rather they go to the movies to watch a story and get into a fantastical world. 3D can be used as a tool to get them immersed into that world (e.g. 'Avatar', 'How To Train Your Dragon'), not as a tool to show off and be proud of itself. And that is exactly what happened to 'Resident Evil: Afterlife'. The film's action sequences in 3D is merely exploiting the format and is equivalent to an outdated old man wearing hip-hop clothes and screaming 'Hey, look at me! I'm hip! I'm fresh!'. This kills the film and makes it look desperate and lame.I apologize to those who reject my review. There will always be lovers as well as haters. These are just merely my thoughts, and who's to stop you from going to see the movie. But this 3D film is absolutely pointless to watch in my humble opinion, with no standing out qualities (apart from the pointless but well-made 3D). I'd rather not watch this one again.Overall value: 34/100",3,7,16,25 September 2010
Star Trek," Star Trek: Resurrection...
","Let me just start off by saying this is NOT your grandpa's Star Trek, or your older brother's Next Generation. This is a completely new and refreshing take on the beloved series of old, and, man, it sure delivers!I am NOT a Trekkie, although I've seen most of the movies. Having said that, the story is well-told, the screenplay by Transformers penners John Brancato and Michael Ferris is solid, and there are fine and loyal performances abound. The standouts are Zachary Quinto as Spock, wise as ever, but most surprisingly Chris Pine as Kirk. His performance is one of the very best factors of the movie; not only does it show his characteristics in the series, it also adds a new trait to his already recognizable character; adrenaline junkie. The rest of the cast deliver (again) fine performances; Karl Urban as Dr. McCoy, Eric Bana as the truly villainous Nero, Zoe Saldana as the gorgeous Uhura, Anton Yelchin (in a somewhat ridiculous Russian accent) as Chekov, John Cho as Sulu (good to see Cho in his first action scene), and Simon Pegg as Scotty (which is one of the very best comic-relief film characters in YEARS). Rounding up the cast is a surprise appearance by Winona Ryder as Spock's human mother, Bruce Greenwood as the Enterprise's first captain Pike, and last, but not least, Leonard Nimoy as the original Spock, whose character bridges the gap between the old and the new Trek.I'm surprised that a summer blockbuster has its plot driven mostly by strong characterization, not to mention making some cheesy moments smart. I'm even more surprised that the cheese factor is very low for this one!The cinematography is big in scope, the editing is fluid, and the production design is beautiful. But there are three technical aspects that deserve the highest merit for making this film great:1. The special effects. Eye popping from start to finish. Immediately after the studio logos end the action starts on the screen and rarely relents from then onwards. Superbly designed, colorful, and sumptuous nonetheless, the SFX makes the action more thrilling, as the CGI is crisp and extremely realistic. So far this is a future contender for a Best Visual Effects Oscar.2. Michael Giacchino's orchestral score. His music is simply epic. Throbbing, dynamic, and glorious, the man knows how to make music and definitely how to make it work. It adds tension and excitement to the film.3. The film would not have been the success it would have been had it not been for one man and one man only. And that man is director JJ Abrams. Not only is he the right man for the job, his epic direction puts all the elements together to make one hell of a summer blockbuster. Really, if not for J.J., who else? So, to pen off, this is the first REAL blockbuster of 2009 (it beats the living CRAP out of the merely OKAY 'Wolverine'). It has enough action to put in three blockbusters, and it has enough effects to fill two. It has strong character development, excellent action and timing, brilliant special effects, and something new and familiar for Trekkies and non-Trekkies alike. This is the Star Trek film I've been waiting for. No cheesy lines or cheesy action. No (too) melodramatic speeches. I may not be a Trekkie, but I will definitely consider myself and others who like this film a 'Neo-Trekkie', and will look out for the next voyage of the Enterprise, so as long as the cast and/or Abrams stay on board.Welcome to the 'new' Enterprise.Entertainment value: 10/10Overall: 8/10",6,2,8,9 May 2009
Akira," A surreal future out of control.
","Anime is an underrated genre in the world of cinema. Unlike the American animators who either take cover for princesses/talking animals, and whose major attempt at branching out to an older audience include (pre)teen action adventures or cartoon adaptations of comic books (perhaps the sole exception to these rules is Ralph Bakshi), Japanese animation has the potential to leap to adult, mature-minded audiences, exploring fantasies and futures that, no matter how many times Hollywood tries, they simply can not replicate. However, Japanese animation was fairly overlooked and undervalued for a very long time in North America.In 1988, Katsuhiro Otomo's 'Akira' was released to instant classic status in Japan and still managed to find a small following in the Western world. However, its popularity was so infectious, that its appeal spread throughout the Western world and created a new generation, and legion, of anime fans. They soon wanted more, and the rest was history. It was a global cultural landmark. But I digress.Many others have said it before, and I'll say it again - 'Akira' ranks amongst the greatest animated films. Amazing that a story about an out of control psychic can be transformed with such Gothic and macabre detail, yet visually it is still utterly mesmerizing; how everything falls into place, how it looks, how it sounds, how it feels. It has been said that Otomo animated the voice actors' lips and synchronized it by hand onto the characters. The film also reportedly used over 160,000 animation cells. When put together it forms a gripping effect, we see the characters are hand-drawn, yet the super-fluid motion and good voice acting says otherwise. Groundbreaking stuff. The US$ 10 million (yes it was that expensive) budget had been put to supremely excellent use. tell the creators put a lot of effort and determination to give the public what they want.In the year 2019, youth culture, delinquency, social unrest and future uncertainty are abundant. The city of Neo-Tokyo is weighed against the historical spectre of nuclear destruction and Japan's post-war economic revival. Otomo and his animators realizes this scenario with some jaw dropping sights, the encompassing metropolis of Neo-Tokyo fills up the screen, the streets filled with neon lights, chaos by oppressed citizens, and a shroud of gloom and despair throughout. You can tell that the look and feel of Neo-Tokyo has been inspired by, perhaps even modeled after many film noirs or neo-noirs more than science fiction. 'Blade Runner' is probably the biggest influence on the film's look (the year 2019 should be the biggest clue).Despite the futuristic elements, the city surprisingly shows a lack of technological progress as oppressed citizens take to the streets to overthrow the corrupt government. Amongst all this, the main story involves teenage delinquents, which looks like a cross between Hells' Angels and the delinquents in 'The Warriors'. One of them, Tetsuo, begins to harness supernatural powers after a freak accident, and he begins to lash out at anyone who opposes him - all while his best friend Kaneda tries to stop him/save him. Kaneda is the typical male anime hero, cocky, hilariously arrogant/ignorant at times, but desperately determined. Tetsuo, the villain, slowly descends into insanity and we watch as his design also changes along with his character. It's a solid tale of good and bad, the future, abusing power, friendship, and surprisingly, the introspective near the end of the movie, which is enough to make Kubrick proud.I love how the film is put together and arranged at the right moments. Crisp editing makes the fluid animation smoothly glide by. Otomo's masterful direction of not only the heavy material and spectacular visuals accompanies the slick, ambitious and thrilling action sequences, more than complementing the visual world that he has created. The violence in said action sequences are shockingly graphic, but not overly grotesque like many other animes before it - it's just the right amount. This is not a movie for young children to watch, unless you feel they are mature enough to handle graphic violence and some introspective scenes. Rounding up everything to come into fruition is the atypical anime, or film, music score. Composed by Shoji Yamashiro and performed by his musical troupe the Geinoh Yamashirogumi, haunting visuals of the city and the graphic action are accompanied by surreal sounds of traditional Japanese chimes, chants and drums, giving it a wholly cultural feel to the film and seemingly making it exist in a truly different world than the one we know.This film is excellent, simply excellent. An event of gargantuan proportions. Run out, buy this, see this yesterday, and preserve it for generations to come. Some films can be forgotten - this film will stay with you. It's a shame Otomo's next directorial feature was to become the disappointment that is 'Steamboy'. He should have another go for ambition.",9,1,4,12 October 2007
Iron Man 2," Good sequel but it doesn't live up to the first...
","Ah, yes, it's that time of that month again. Summer is here. The season for school holidays, fun in the sun, and cineplexes filled to the brim with bid-budget, CGI-laden blockbusters, most of them either superhero movies or sequels. 'Iron Man 2' is a sequel to the 2008 superhero smash hit and while it delivers in spades action and well-executed CGI, I felt that it was not as great as the first.But first, the pros. Robert Downey, Jr. is still Tony Stark. He has an endless amount of charm, wit, suaveness and one-liners that makes him an extremely like-able whenever he's on the screen. Gwyneth Paltrow also returns as (un)lucky assistant Pepper Potts who again does a good job in contrasting Stark's happy-go-lucky personality with her straightforward behavior. New performers are here as well: Mickey Rourke is, as always, excellent as the villain, as per Sam Rockwell who gives a somewhat hilarious but smart villain, and Samuel L. Jackson just drips coolness whenever he appears.The special effects are very well-rendered and the action sequences are well-directed with high energy by Jon Favreau (also playing Happy Hogan, whom I am glad gets more screen time here). Also the music score by John Debney is suitable for the movie.However, the film has its cons as well. While Don Cheadle does an okay job at playing Rhodes, he just doesn't have that charm that Terrence Howard had in the first movie. To me, it seems as if he feels awkward in that role. Scarlett Johansson proves that she can kick ass if she really wants to (and looks gorgeous doing it at the same time), but her screen time is relatively short and unimportant compared to other characters.Also, the action in this sequel seems somewhat rushed, especially in the third act where it almost falls apart. It's as if screenwriter Justin Theroix doesn't really know how to end this thing, and as such we get quite the muddled ending. Also, I felt like the story took a detour from the realistic setting of the first to a more comic-book/sci-fi-like setting and some pretty cheesy villains if you ask me.Having said that, what was lost in action, was returned in the character exploration of Tony Stark. We see a great deal of character study in this film, more than in the first. Tony Stark is not perfect, he is not exactly an ideal superhero, and this is really proved in the middle of the film during his birthday party. We get to know more about Tony and what motivates his actions. We get to know what makes him tick, what makes him scared.So, overall, it's still fine entertainment, but those looking for it to exceed the original, or have high expectations, will be disappointed. I really wished it had more action as well as the character study (just look at 'The Dark Knight'). However, this summer is off to a good start, and I expect more entertaining fluff to come.I still have faith in the series. Bring on 'Iron Man 3'.Overall value: 7/10",5,7,19,29 April 2010
Zootopia," The Fox and the Hare
","Once upon a time, predatory animals were either the sinister villains or the square-jawed heroes of Disney Animated films, with the cuddly animals ('prey' if I'd go further) being either comic relief or the central protagonist. With 'Zootopia', where anthropomorphic mammals live and breathe in a bustling metropolis ala humans (with nary a homo sapien in sight), the tables have turned - cuddly animals such as our heroine, a rabbit cop named Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) has shifted into figures of empowerment and inspiration, while big predatory animals have become either the cute ones - as seen in an overweight man-child cheetah cop who obsesses over a famous pop star while on desk duty - or a mischievous comic relief as per con-artist fox Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman).Wilde is the archetypal wily fox – there's not a word that he says that isn't cynical or sarcastic. Although the character is animated, this is essentially Bateman being his laid-back self, which strongly anchors this film down to earth. Wilde provides a pleasant foil against Goodwin's Hopps, who is eager to do good (not unlike co- director Rich Moore's 'Wreck-It Ralph') and make Zootopia a better place, but constantly finds her naiveté not only challenged by Wilde's put- downs, but also by her own parents' over-protectiveness and even the Zootopia police chief, a bison (voiced by Idris Elba) and caricature of the stereotypical cop-movie chief, who bluntly tells Hopps that being a cop 'isn't some fairy tale with songs and dance. Let it go.'Indeed, 'Zootopia' is not the usual Disney fare – the similarity ends with the talking animals, extremely likable characters and rapid- fire humor – I lost it in numerous scenes, particularly an adorable riff on 'The Godfather' – that will entertain kids and adults alike. What we have here is essentially a buddy cop movie (think '48 Hrs', 'Rush Hour', 'Lethal Weapon') that skirts into noir territory at times - where one's a do-gooder cop and the other's a rebel, and they both team up to stop a bigger threat towards the city, bonding in the process. The Disney version, at least. Spoilers ahead.How this leads into a political conspiracy involving a plot to segregate the prey from predators, I will not reveal. Here Disney makes a bold move, not only subverting their decades-old predator/prey animal tropes, but not-so-subtly confronting the media blitz against race-induced crimes. I am instantly reminded of the American media who gobble up any news involving multi-racial crimes and subsequent controversies with law enforcement, with no qualms given to either side of the fence to express their proper opinion. Howard and Moore, along with their writers, remarkably handle their material sensibly and level-headedness – and with Disney's lesson of the movie – about acceptance and unity, delivered with care.This could be one of the year's best films.",8,5,15,10 March 2016
The Impossible," Horrifying depiction of a tragic event
","A moment of guilt sunk in as I was watching Juan Antonio Bayona's 'The Impossible'. It's during the holiday scenes in the first five or so minutes of the film, where the tourists were happily lighting floating lanterns on the beach the night before Christmas '04. The calm before the storm.How haunting to remember, the happy faces of the tourists/couples as they bustle about partying and celebrating on the coasts of Thailand. How haunting to know that it would be one of their final nights, as I was, days before the horrific event, treading one of the very beaches struck hard by the waves. It's moments like that you ask yourself, do you truly have a life well-spent? Because it could be gone tomorrow, and there is nothing anyone can do about it.Yes, the trailers do indeed spoil the movie, but if you think about it, it doesn't matter if you've seen the trailer or not. We all saw the news footage during and after the disaster, and the images hauntingly burned in our brains as a memento of the merciless fury of mother nature.But Bayona does something else. The waves devastate the landscape, turning a land of pure beauty into a ruined wasteland beyond comprehension. Trees tumble, buildings are smashed, people are swept away and knocked around within the waves and debris. If that sounds horrific enough, Bayona doesn't hold back and we are treated to his recreation those cringing moments to gripping effect. Naomi Watts' blood-curdling scream as she clings on to dear life amidst raging waters and drifting debris sums the experience up. This scene makes the one in Clint Eastwood's 'Hereafter' look like CliffNotes.After the tsunami comes another harrowing look at the aftermath. The survivors are meandering around, shell-shocked by the devastation and loss. The Thai hospitals are thrown into chaos as the hallways and rooms overflow with patients and corpses. These scenes are done tremendously well.The film's focus, however, is on a wealthy British family separated during the disaster. The mother (Watts) is swept away along with the eldest son (Tom Holland), and the father (Ewan McGregor) with the younger two sons. Each side fears the other is done for. It is a testament to their will and determination that all five manage to pull through to ultimately survive this ordeal. Holland and McGregor are very effective in their roles, but Watts gives the best performance, as a woman who has just seen the worst first-hand and still is determined to keep going.Yes, there are genre conventions. The real family which survived this have all been turned British for this film. Disaster genre conventions, especially fateful meetings and misses, are done to death in a lot of movies in a cheap attempt to exploit the emotion out of the audience. In this movie it's no exception, and the final reunion of the family, where they find each other, is frankly, ham-fistedly directed but well-acted. Aside from that minor gripe, the point is, Bayona uses this family's story as a central point to revisit the devastation of the tsunami aftermath. And he succeeds effortlessly at that.Three years ago, I saw this Chinese movie called 'Aftershock' about the 1976 Tangshan Earthquake in China and it's ripples across a family. That movie used its effects horrifyingly well also, as per this one which ratchets up the cringe-factor up to 11. The PG-13 rating has never been more justified in recent times, with injury-related gore/nudity prevalent throughout the film to show the masses what's real. If you ever wondered if you spent enough time with your loved ones, this film will give you a reminder.A VERY GOOD disaster film.",7,2,4,12 January 2013
Argo," Everyone loves the movies...
","Ben Affleck's 'Argo' opens with a stunning prologue depicting the siege and takeover of the American Embassy in Tehran during the 1979 Iranian Revolution. The whole sequence is exciting and extremely involving. The leading up to the main core of the film's plot is also as engaging.'Argo' tells the true story of a fake movie which saved the lives of the Americans trapped during the crisis. There are obvious parts which are too 'movie-ish' and 'Americanized', however, without them it can't be considered a mainstream movie now can it? When all other plans fail, the CIA allows their specialist Tony Mendez (Affleck) to go ahead with his plan - with the help of Hollywood make-up artist John Chambers (John Goodman) and producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) to front a fake movie studio, approve a science-fiction script, fly Mendez to Iran, and fly the Americans out of Tehran disguised as film crewmembers on a location shoot. No matter how ridiculous the plan sounds like, it's a true story nonetheless. And this is a thrilling depiction of the affair.It's also a reminder of how powerful the movies can be, both by itself and the making of. This story takes place when two countries are both on the edge, and tensions are spiking on the extreme. Movie magic apparently eases and spellbinds both sides, you'll see what I mean when watching this.The film also fiercely supports my notion that Ben Affleck is fast on his way into becoming a versatile filmmaker by his own right, and has already evolved into a promising one. Might he be the next Clint Eastwood? Too early to tell, yes, but Affleck shows no sign of sloppiness thus far. Affleck is fairly good in his performance but he directs the film with supreme confidence and skill, using subtle techniques to wring out the thrills.I especially liked how the film really is a pure thriller instead of the obligatory car chases and gunfights (although the climax is technically a chase, it is subtly directed making it helluva exciting). Affleck, in the past decade being typecast as an action hero, now doesn't even fire a single shot in this one. I like that.Technically, the film looks like it came out of a time capsule, with the production and costume design, '70s grain and even the vintage Warner Bros logo are at play - it delves you into the film even further. Editing is appropriately paced, yet Alexandre Desplat's music score could have been a bit better. Just my two cents.With a strong supporting cast (Arkin and Goodman are hilarious in their parts, injecting surprising cynical humor; Bryan Cranston as Mendez's supervisor; Victor Garber as the Canadian ambassador who bravely risks himself while sheltering the Americans) and an intelligent, fiercely exciting, intensely moving, and appropriately terse screenplay. However the film's flaws may be, 'Argo' is still one hell of a thriller.Overall: 84%",7,3,6,17 October 2012
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Entertaining summer romp
","Movies are like food. There are some which are bitter and hard to swallow yet nutritious in every aspect, and those which are tasty albeit fattening. 'Prince Of Persia' falls in the latter category, it's fun to watch and enjoyable, and where intelligence doesn't really matter.With Jerry Bruckheimer producing, lots of action, adventure and excitement are promised. With 'Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time' he continues that promise. The film, from start to finish, is filled with well-choreographed sword-fighting action, fantastic special effects, sweepingly exotic scenery, lavish production design, and a good, sweeping music score by Harry Gregson-Williams. During the action scenes the camera does not shake that much compared to recent movies... although I admit there are one too many slow-motion sequences, that (although gorgeous to look at) distracts the audience too much. However Bruckheimer has a thing for slo-mo, so he's excused. The screenplay is about what you'd expect for a Hollywood-filmed Arabian adventure.The actors did a good job with the material they're given. Jake Gyllenhaal emits sex appeal and charisma throughout, walking through the film with ease. And he's quite good with the action sequences and fighting! Jake, welcome to the action hero club. A big surprise though is Gemma Arterton's performance as Princess Tamina; it is a HUGE improvement from her bland performances in 'Quantum Of Solace' and 'Clash Of The Titans'; here Arterton manages to inject wit, charm AND emotion into her character, not to mention looking gorgeous at the same time. However I was slightly disappointed by Ben Kingsley's performance - a two dimensional villain. Granted, Kingsley acted great in the role but I felt like it just didn't match to his standards. Alfred Molina has a funny supporting role and the rest of the cast did quite a good job, although I wish a little characterization would come from this.Still, Mike Newell's tight direction manage to put all these amazing factors together, thus he and Bruckheimer not only made an entertaining summer blockbuster, they also made arguably one of, if not the, best movies based on a video game ever. Period.In short, if you want to take a little escape from reality, go back in time to 'Prince of Persia' and enjoy. It's fun and light on the brain.Entertainment value: 9/10Overall: 7/10",5,111,206,27 May 2010
127 Hours," A reminder of why the human spirit triumphs over all
","If there were any force of nature that is more powerful that anything else in the world, perhaps even in the universe, it is the human spirit - and its will to survive. In Danny Boyle's '127 Hours', Aron Ralston becomes the embodiment of the human spirit, and we are captivated and we cheer for him, both towards the film and to the real person as well. Here is a man that is full of courage and determination to did what he had to do to survive, and that is a triumph in itself.In the film, Ralston is played by James Franco. He is the core of the entire movie, with the entire movie focused on him; not only does he physically fit the real Ralston well, he also delivers a terrific performance, that is really physically and mentally draining, both for him to deliver and for us to watch. This is Franco's best film thus far. Take for example the scenes where he interviews himself. It may be comic relief but Franco displays every emotional shade that really showcases his true, raw talent as an actor, and also engages the audience in a thrill ride, even though the film isn't an action film.But it doesn't need to be an action film. Danny Boyle, fresh from his Oscar win for 'Slumdog Millionaire', utilizes his same kinetic and energetic direction in every shot so that Franco's vivid portrayal can shine through with the same energy as a lightning bolt, and the film's pace not feel boring throughout. The editing by Jon Harris is pitch perfect; it is vibrant without being forceful, and it is inventive with its cutting, especially during the split-screen scenes, but in some parts it gets quite distracting. Boyle employs two cinematographers for this film: his usual one Anthony Dod Mantle, and Enrique Chediak. Both make full use of the camera as they both shoot sweeping scenery of the American desert and canyons at the beginning, and then when Ralston is trapped they think of every possible angle they can place their camera on to give a sense of extreme claustrophobia and realism. The home-video feel adds more to the experience and makes the film feel as real as possible. Also from 'Slumdog', acclaimed Indian composer A. R. Rahman returns to give an ambient and quite somber score that suits the situations perfectly.The way Boyle depicts Ralston's excruciating ordeal is raw and almost documentary-like. It's not too dark and brooding and full of hopelessness, nor is it handled in a clumsily light-hearted manner (NO ONE in their right mind will try to craft this film in the latter way). Boyle knows what he's doing. So is Franco. The way the young actor screams, the expressions he shows when he is distraught and desperate, the way the camera focuses on his face somberly as if it was his doom, it is excruciating to watch but at the same time no one can pry their eyes off the screen. At the climax of the film there is a very graphic and disturbing scene that will make the squeamish turn away, but I say it adds greatly to the film's harrowing effect.In my opinion this film deserves every single accolade it has received. This film is not only an inspiring tale that is well-crafted and extremely well-acted, it's in many ways a testament to the human spirit and it's undying determination to survive. In this world some of us may be cast aside and left unnoticed as the world keeps spinning, but let this movie be reminded that there is still hope, and it comes in strange, and sometimes unpleasant ways. Bravo to Mr. Boyle, Mr. Franco, and the crew of the film, and very especially Mr. Ralston for such a tremendous accomplishment.Another reason why Hollywood still has some juice in it.Overall rating: 89/100",8,0,1,26 February 2011
Spider-Man 3," Terrific way to start the summer, but overall very disappointing after watching it a second time.
","This, is perhaps, the worst of the Spider-Man movies thus far. And this film has many reasons to show so. Such a reason is that it is crammed full of characters and irrelevant subplots like a pack of sardines, the and also characters become overly emotionally driven. Another thing is that we get to see Spidey fight THREE super villains, but the fights itself are abrupt. The story is a shattered mess and it feels forcibly rushed.This can be considered as Sam Raimi's most expensive film by far, in my opinion. In fact, it was because he directed all three Spider-Man films that the franchise was able to survive. He has heart and soul while working behind the camera, but his and his brother's screenplay just did not make the cut. He's hardworking, though. Usually, directors often quit after the second film when making a superhero film. Such as the case of the horrendous Batman film franchise (before the fantastic Batman Begins). I will look forward to seeing Spider-Man 4, if there will be one.Special effects are the only things that are praised here. Scott Stotdyk does an incredible job with keeping the special effects, and it seems that he may be good enough like John Dykstra, who won Spider-Man 2 an Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and left the third to do the much anticipated live action adaptation of the popular children's toy series Hot Wheels.Here, all the familiar faces do their job like in the first, with comments for Maguire and Franco for playing their characters in a slightly unusual style. However, the best acting here goes to Thomas Haden Church, who steals the show as Flint Marko a.k.a. Sandman, whose crime involving the death of Peter's Uncle Ben has a motive behind it, and so his character is understandable.Judging from the plot outline above, one can't help but feel whether this film will get complicated in a way, with all the happenings in it. Fear, for the complicated plot is what keeps this film from being a worthy entry in the series, and that's what's crappy about it.As I said in the beginning of this review, what a great way to start the summer. Watch it in the cinema once (recommended), but do not bother getting the DVD unless you're a die-hard fan.It should have ended with 2.5.6/10",5,7,15,1 May 2007
Yes Man," Carrey's back.
","In this feel-good film, Carl Allen (Jim Carrey) challenges himself to say Yes to almost anything and everything. Concept aside, this is a remarkable comedic comeback for Carrey, after the magnificent Michel Gondry art piece 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', the mediocre but dark thriller 'The Number 23', and the animated 'Horton Hears a Who!' There are a lot of jokes in the film, and some of them are put to well use. But Carrey blazes above all else with his humor. He's still the zany goofy guy we all like, but not as hypercaffienated as 'Ace Ventura' or that ''truthful'' lawyer in 'Liar Liar'. Carrey has matured. But he's still very funny. This film may very well be Carrey's funniest film since the first 'Ace Ventura', and that's saying something.The story is somewhat formulaic and predictable. But it's all good as the jokes and mostly Carrey save the film. Sure, it has a preachy message hidden somewhere in there, but all in all it's a pretty good message: Say yes to (almost) everything and you'll have a better life. I couldn't agree more after seeing this film.Supporting actors are good here, but the standout is Zooey Deschanel. It's her innocence and natural charm that makes her appeal to the audience, and it is refreshing.Overall, it's a very good comedy that will definitely make you smile, feel better, and inspired when you walk out of the cinema. Definitely a watch, especially in these dark economic times.Entertainment value: 9/10Overall: 8/10",6,3,6,21 December 2008
A Bridge Too Far," A criminally underrated war near-masterpiece that deserves more attention.
","Picked this up at a DVD store, had no idea it would be this good. I was a bit astonished at IMDb's rating of the film... 7.3?! WHAT?!! Should have been in the Top 250 for all I know. Because the ingredients of a dazzling film is all here, in this movie.To start off, the cast. Sean Connery! Michael Caine! Gene Hackman! Robert Redford! Anthony Hopkins! Elliot Gould! Laurence Olivier! Dirk Bogard! Ryan O' Neal! Edward Fox! An A-list cast ensemble of their time, on the screen for our enjoyment. Need I say more? The story is good, it is accurate to the real battles (as well as the novel), and it has its fair share of dramatic moments to boot without getting too melodramatic. The dialog is good, and it's great to see Germans speaking their own language for once instead of English like the greatly flawed film Midway.The music by John Addison is also commendable, as it is throbbing and heroic, really suits the military scenes as well, and it is not heard during the action scenes, this is good as it prevents the grittiness of war from being distracted by the glorious score of the film.The cinematography is lush, beautiful, and scenic. This makes the battle scenes majestic and the slow moments poignant. The scenes with the paratroopers preparing for the jump makes your jaw drop in amazement and wonder as you say, 'How'd the hell they'd do that?' And that's in the 70's, folks! The direction by sir Richard Attenborough is wonderful, kinetic and gripping. The battle scenes are astounding, with real army tanks and real soldiers as extras duking it out on the battlefield. It is truly a sight to behold. As for the paratrooper scenes, I don't know how he did it. The action is raw, in-your-face and intense, and quite graphic at times. That's the real spirit of war.In short, it's a war near-masterpiece, a criminally underrated one at that. Give this a try. With all that's said and done, you will love it.Overall quality: 8.986/10Delton",8,12,18,26 July 2008
The Terminator," Relevant more than ever
","30 years down the road, James Cameron's 'The Terminator' remains an enthralling science fiction thriller, perhaps now more relevant than ever. By now nearly everyone would have heard about how Cameron miraculously made such an excellent film on a miniscule US$6 million budget or so, or perhaps how the eponymous character turned bodybuilder- cum-actor Arnold Schwarzenegger into literally Hollywood's next big thing. It is a testament to Cameron's genius into crafting his unique vision despite and because of his budget limitations, and perfectly casting his stars to suit said vision.We all know the drill by now, so let's talk quality. Linda Hamilton portrays Sarah so well as a normal young woman, confused by this sudden chain of events, that she has logically no choice but to buy into Reese's story. Michael Biehn fits Reese to a T with a gruff yet youthful look, a perfect look for a determined soldier fighting a war he wants to end badly, despite his limitations. Though it's under a relatively short amount of time, Cameron takes his time for the audience to really get to understand both Sarah and Reese's predicaments – to have characters to root and care for, to see them find a way out despite the odds. And a romantic twist is added by Cameron that surprisingly doesn't feel forced, yet somehow perfectly (and ironically) completes the time travel loop that secures John's existence. We're dealing with a romance that transcends both time and space, and Cameron handles it so well, he would revisit these romantic traits with greater detail in his future megalith 'Titanic'.What makes the film work more than it should is Cameron's genius in casting Schwarzenegger as The Terminator. A former Mr. Olympian, Schwarzenegger is renowned for his sculpted body – straight out of a Greek stone garden – more than his acting prowess. No matter, his manner of speaking less, and frighteningly intimidating stare clearly unnerve the hell out of audiences, and they still do today. Say what you will about Schwarzenegger's career as an action icon/live-action meme, the man still has a stare that can kill. His strong, iconic Austrian accent works wonders with the machine-like delivery that Cameron was intending. With Schwarzenegger's casting, the stakes are higher for both Sarah and Reese to escape this monstrosity.Because time-travel is involved and explained in an easily digestible way (physics be damned), and because Cameron directs with such efficiency and confidence it might as well be made today, the film has aged exceptionally well despite some cornball stop-motion effects that show off its low budget – all due praise to the late Stan Winston though for his remarkable, if not grotesque, make-up effects and design that add to the sheer horror aspect of the film. It is a testament to Cameron's genius that he has managed to combine great talent both in front of and behind the camera, into creating one of the seminal and memorable films of the '80s decade, and one that will spawn a successful sci-fi franchise with a dedicated fanbase. Make no mistake that the basic framework of 'The Terminator' essentially represents a B-movie at its surface (Cameron did tutor under B-legend Roger Corman, after all), but Cameron pulls off more tricks up his sleeve. There is a lean, mean atmosphere that permeates each scene throughout, making 1984 Los Angeles seem like a lurid fever nightmare, but that's secondary compared to the hellish, poverty-stricken future he has envisioned for us humans. Brad Fiedel's metallic, iconic score seeps through every alley and night- painted street with a sense of dread and gloom, the synthesized, electronic score complementing Adam Greenberg's cyan-tinted, industrial cinematography to make it feel all the more nightmarish.Most people back than would have balked or be amazed at a wireless internet connection for everyday use, as if we are surrendering our will to technology for it to take over our lives. And I'm seeing it being endorsed in many a commercial or article. Is the development of technology a bad thing? Not at all. But a good servant can be a bad master, especially if left out of control. Cameron had a fear of that, saw the vision, and ran with it all the way. If we were to leave our household chores to artificial intelligence, or the military leaving unmanned drones to scour the battlefield, what's there to say that eventually artificial intelligence would be used to secure nuclear weapons? Or that they might even become sentient - Cleverbot and Siri may be precursors to Skynet, and Japanese technology is developing robotic humanoids that can deduce for themselves in the near future. The war shown in the film may take place in 2029, but Judgment Day can still happen. Better never than late, I say.'The Terminator' may be surpassed by its immediate successor in terms of scale and action sequences, but this is a leaner, meaner film, and its initial allegory remains superior and more clear-cut; in the realms of science fiction it remains unmatched, as a bleak reminder of the future and technology gone wrong, perfectly represented by its unstoppable, merciless eponymous monster of a character, but also that of humanity's undying spirit to create their own fates. Cameron might have come a long way since then, having helmed two of the most expensive and highest- grossing films in history back-to-back with some truly groundbreaking visual effects technology implemented in both, but this only highlights his original, cautionary vision for the future, one that we are all far too willing to embrace wholeheartedly.",9,3,4,19 July 2014
The Adventures of Tintin," For 1 hour and 40 minutes I was a kid again
","There was a time where kids found entertainment by reading the daily comics or even buying them at the local bookstore, awaiting the adventures of their favorite superhero. 'Tintin' was my childhood favorite, and although it wasn't in English when I read it, they were (and still are) extremely exciting and humorous page-turners.I've always awaited the next one, but I was disappointed when I found out that the comics were old and that the author had already died. I wasn't disappointed that they were old, heavens, no - I was disappointed that there were no more adventures of that intrepid reporter, his faithful dog, and his wide variety of friends and enemies that always makes for such an exciting read. Years later the 1991 animated series popped up on Cartoon Network Asia, and it was a fixture for me. The series is brilliant - as loyal as a Belgian animated series could be. I've always thought that if Hollywood decides to make a movie, the only person who could've done it and pulled it off was Steven Spielberg ('Indiana Jones' took inspiration not only from James Bond but also from Tintin).Flash forward to 2011. Spielberg was directing, and both he and 'Lord of the Rings' Peter Jackson are producing it. I became hugely excited. Despite knowing that it was going to be filmed in 3D animation, I walked into the (2D) theater with high expectations. And despite its flaws and slight deviations from Herge's comics, I was not disappointed. There was a sigh of relief - a ringing thought that kept saying 'Spielberg has done it.''The Adventures of Tintin' is a great film for the family to be on the edge of their seats. The plot is 'The Secret of the Unicorn' dashed in with bits of 'The Crab with the Golden Claws' and 'Red Rackham's Treasure'. The mystery and intrigue are combined with engaging and at times outrageous/hilarious action sequences - one of which is a seamless, spectacular one-take chase scene which exudes a high energy level not sensed since those in the 'Indiana Jones' films - there's a real high sense of adventure throughout the film. The effects are top notch and apparently show the best of motion-capture technology - it is so good that I forgot that I was watching merely animated characters and that I was watching a comic book unfold on the big screen. Spielberg and Jackson have triumphed with the motion capture here, making Robert Zemeckis' previous runs with the technology look pale in comparison. Crisp and colorful cinematography by Janusz Kaminski, fluid editing by Michael Kahn and yet another lively and bombastic score by John Williams make this an even more entertaining watch.As for the good (motion capture) acting, Jamie Bell captures the Tintin character nicely. His look and speech is there - as well as his sense for intrigue. Andy Serkis is wonderful as the grizzled Captain Haddock - his comic timing and gruff voice perfectly embodies the character - although there are moments which makes the character too goofy, even more than his comic counterpoint. I didn't even realize it was Daniel Craig as the voice of the villain Sakharine with a slight dastardly sneer in his voice. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost don't get enough screen time as the dim-witted twin detectives Thomson and Thompson but their silliness matches the comics' counterparts but I feel it is not as humorous as when I first read it. They get the job done, though.Somehow I don't like plots which are cobbled up from lots of different plots into one. They just don't blend together nicely, and this film is no exception - this being its biggest flaw. Right from the start of the movie (after the stylish beginning credits similar to Spielberg's own 'Catch Me If You Can') the film never really focuses on its characters and goes straight for the mystery and the story. Haddock even takes center stage in many scenes instead of the titular Tintin. The characterization is at the mercy of the action-packed spectacles, and heart-pounding intrigue. It's a shame because the characters are interesting by itself - intelligent and spontaneous (Tintin and Snowy), cantankerous (Haddock), dastardly (Sakharine), silly (Thomson and Thompson), but not insulting to the audience nor stereotyped. If the film had 20 extra minutes devoted to its characters, then we just might have the first CG-animated motion capture classic. It's a bit of a shame, really.Despite it's flaws, 'The Adventures of Tintin' is a rollicking good time at the movies, a serial adventure with lots of action, excitement and humor, and perfect for families with its lack of adult content (apart from alcohol content and some intense action sequences). The effects are seamless and easy on the eyes (haven't seen the 3D version yet - though I've heard its very good). This is truly a Spielberg film - his entertainment sense still going strong.For 1 hour and 40 minutes I was a kid again, fists clenched during the action sequences. Yet the characterization and their motives do not get their due, but I suspect that this was merely a way to introduce the world of Tintin to today's fast-paced audiences, and predicting that if they loved it, the characterization will be put into the sequels. Something like that. Maybe. Here's hoping.It isn't as brilliant as the comics or the TV show but you could do much worse than 'Tintin', because at least it doesn't have pointless action, choppy editing or shaky camera to ruin the effects; or cardboard, stereotyped characters to chew the scenery. 'Battle: Los Angeles' or 'Transformers' anyone?Overall rating: 80/100",7,2,7,6 November 2011
The Way Back," An epic, exquisitely shot and harrowing adventure about survival and the pursuit of freedom
","So the book has been proved false. Does this mean that the 'true story' isn't true after all? There have been many claims by others that it is fact instead of fiction. Whatever - it doesn't matter, Peter Weir's 'The Way Back', this movie about that book, which tells the tale of gulag escapees and their harrowing journey to freedom, is a well-told and inspiring tale than anything else.All of the actors are terrific in their roles - Jim Sturgess as the de- facto leader of the bunch, showing a more improved and mature side to his acting since '21'; Ed Harris as the gruff American Smith, who is hard-edged and iron-willed until he eventually befriends...; Saiorse Ronan as Irene, the runaway girl who joins them on their quest - Ronan here shows a perfect balance of various emotions while not overdoing it like many child stars her age... she definitely is one of the best young actresses today; Colin Farrell as the violent yet humorous soldier who protects the team from danger in Siberia and provides comic relief when needed - Farrell shows that he can be tough yet likable at the same time without being completely overblown and shows his versatility as an actor; European actors Dragos Bucur, Alexandru Potocean, Sebastian Urzendowsky and Gustaf Skarsgård round off the remaining escapees and they all acted great in their respective and differing roles. The chemistry between all of the actors at parts are great.Having said that, the film's only flaw is that it sacrificed substantial characterization for realism and visual spectacles. The characters are thinly but not overly so fleshed out, and the interactions between them are short before the next walking shot. But when it comes to realism and believability the film succeeds. I was surprised when I saw National Geographic was one of the co-producers of the film, but I wasn't as soon as I saw how realistic the depictions of survival the characters did in the film. Men will do anything to escape to freedom, and the determination and spirit to survive in a harsh and unforgiving natural world, is what Weir and his script is trying to say, but the walking parts are written in masterful detail that any line of dialog may ruin it, so silence is sometimes golden in these parts. The screenplay also challenges the usual Hollywood clichés that usually are found in this film genre, and it transforms them into better, more realistic and sometimes unsettling situations.Production-wise, the film is a triumph. The production design is great and makes extremely well use of real locations. The cinematography by Russell Boyd is dazzling, simply marvelous, it is wide, sweeping and epic, with lush scenery of forests, deserts and the snow-peaked Himalayas exquisitely shot throughout. The wide cinematography makes the experience even more harrowing thanks to Lee Smith's fluid and crisp editing and Burkhard Dallwitz's great music score and terrific music timing - Dallwitz and Weir know when and how music/sound can be used in a scene, and that sometimes, silence is crucial to certain moments. Here, Weir uses that silence to terrific and very intense effect, and with his extremely focused direction, manages to being out a very exhilarating and at the same time excruciating (in a good way) experience. So much so that I forgot about the controversy surrounding the 'true story' and found myself hugely engrossed in the movie, not wanting it to end.In short, the film lightly suffers from lack of proper characterization, but is heavy on almost everything else - acting, directing, cinematography, production value and music. If it had proper characterization, it would have been an instant classic and a contender for the Best Picture Oscar. Still, as it stands, 'The Way Back' is still an epic adventure; an inspiring, sometimes funny, and often intense and harrowing experience that also proves that Peter Weir is still an ambitious tour-de-force filmmaker.Overall rating: 77/100",7,93,115,22 January 2011
Megamind," Not exactly original or great, but it's cute and still better and funnier than 'Madagascar'.
","Well with all of the great/excellent CG-animated films to come out, especially in this year alone, there's always one which is bound to break the streak. Unfortunately, that party-pooper arrives in the form of 'Megamind', another animated film about a super-villain trying to do good, hot on the heels of Universal's 'Despicable Me' months ago.Granted, this year also saw the release of Dreamworks Animation's magnum opus 'How To Train Your Dragon', but this film really brings Dreamworks Animation's status down to earth and back into comedy territory. That's not saying that 'Megamind' is a bad film. Far from it, actually. It has a great voice cast, great animation, and great technical aspects. It falls short of having a memorable script and a not-so-original story.Let me just get one thing clear - the voice acting is great. As per with Dreamworks you've got a heck of a cast here: Will Ferell, Tina Fey, Jonah Hill, David Cross and Brad Pitt. Megamind's character works with audiences well because of Ferell and his goofball charm that shows whenever Megamind speaks. The love interest, Roxanne Ritchi, is gorgeously animated and given some spunk with Fey's voice. Cross is cute with his henchman role and Pitt sounds like he's having a fun time spoofing the 'Goody-two-shoes' superhero (maybe himself, as well?), but it is Hill who steals the show when... I'm not going to tell you as it would spoil the film but let's just say he gave his character an extra dimension.Technical wise, the animation is great, with some very detailed action sequences and (in particular one spectacular) explosions. Director Tom McGrath (best known as Skipper, the head honcho of 'The Penguins of Madagascar') gives life in the film's direction. The movements of characters are very fluid, and they're also designed with the best intentions. The art direction looks great - clean when good is around, dark when 'evil' is around. The music by Hans Zimmer and his protégé Lorne Balfe suits the right moods. The soundtrack is great and has many songs from both present and especially past, a very eclectic mix.It's the screenplay's problem that gives the film it's downfall. There's nothing really that memorable from it, as it merely sends up the superhero movie genre, 'Superman' in particular. With many, many references to that 1978 classic, the film loses its originality but has a strong moral core that resonates, especially during the climax of the film - that ultimately, the bad guy can and has to be the good guy. It's not the destination, it's the journey. I personally find Megamind's fate at the end of the movie to be satisfying. It isn't exactly a spoiler, but the film's very predictable at best. And a plus - I find the romantic subplot between Megamind and Roxanne to be extremely sweet, if not corny.Of course, the film also nearly goes back into 'Madagascar' territory with some childish jokes and dance montages to music (one involving a very obvious Michael Jackson hit). However there's not that many and the film can be a tad too intense for children. Believe me, in the cinema where I watched it, a few children were basically on the verge of fear tears during the action sequences, poor kids were too scared to cry.Besides some jokes which are intended for adults which may fly over the heads of kids, 'Megamind' is a pleasant watch for a family night out at the movies. It's not Oscar material and one probably won't soon remember it, but it's far from being bad, not even close. It's just a step above mediocre at best.Overall rating: 57/100",6,0,4,5 November 2010
The Town," The return of Ben Affleck
","'Gigli'. 'Pearl Harbor'. 'Daredevil'.These are the films which have plagued Ben Affleck's career as soon as he and his buddy Matt Damon won an Oscar for 'Good Will Hunting'. Having a share fair of hits and stinkers, Affleck suddenly disappeared from the limelight, having only a minor but acclaimed supporting role in 2006's 'Hollywoodland'. More than a year later Affleck returned to the public's eye with 'Gone Baby Gone', but as the director rather than the star. It shocked everyone, particularly cynics such as myself, because the movie was great in its own right. Was this a fluke or is the 'real' Ben Affleck coming, we cynics say to ourselves.Well, 'The Town' proves that Ben Affleck is not only back, he's at the top of his game.At it's heart, 'The Town' is a simple crime drama/thriller about a group of bank robbers, most particularly their leader, and how he let his human side potentially endanger the rest of his crew, in the small town of Charlestown, Boston. It's a story that we've seen and/or heard one too many times before, and one can already guess the ending of the story.Having said that, a story, no matter how similar or different it is, is worth telling. And 'The Town''s screenplay is written in a careful and constructed way that we get to know more about our bank robber leader and why he is the central character of the story. Using this method we sympathize with him and we root for his character to get out of the mess he's in. This is not original, I have to admit. But his character, and others as well as the entire screenplay, is written in a realistic and believable fashion, as well as giving it a nice Boston touch to it, firmly placing you in the streets of Charlestown. It is clear that the script is a love letter to Boston, as all the dialects and the people are put into account, and they are written well.Before I get to Affleck, I'll start out with the supporting actors - particularly Jeremy Renner as a trigger happy but not-so-psychotic robber. Renner delivers a great performance and shows the versatility that this man can bring to a character after the calm yet cocky performance in last year's Best Picture 'The Hurt Locker'. Rebecca Hall is the love interest but she shows strong vulnerability as a victim always should, so her performance is realistic. Jon Hamm plays an FBI agent bent on catching the crooks - here he is slimy and manipulative - but determined non-the-less. Blake Lively from 'Gossip Girl' really surprised me with her acting talents, greatly show a desperate and ruined woman after playing a glamorous character in that TV show. The rest of the supporting actors do their roles with justice, including Chris Cooper and Pete Postlethwaite. All of the performances are focused, realistic, and believable.Roger Elswit photographs the film beautifully, showing the Bostonian locations in their splendor while also giving a touch of grit to the intense scenes. The camera work is flawless with very little touches of shaky cam, adding a sense of urgency yet spectacle to the action. The editing is also crisp, the film cuts to many moments at the right moments and it isn't quick enough for incoherence like so many MTV music videos, it's just right. As for the production design Boston has rarely looked this great, you can say that this film is a love letter to Charlestown and Boston in particular. The music by Harry Gregson- Williams and David Buckley are suitable for character building moments, and are rightfully excluded for the action scenes to add more tension and unsettledness. Knowing Gregson-Williams tendency for loud music during many of the action movies he scored it is a HUGE relief to see that he has restrained himself here.Which brings us to the man of the hour, Mr. Affleck. As a star he shows vulnerability, dedication, street-smarts and a gentle, human side to him, who always never panics and always knows how to be one step ahead of the cops. His performance is a vast improvement over his blockbuster runs a decade ago and it is clear that he has learned from his mistakes. Pulling a two-punch here, Affleck is not only the main actor but also directed the film - normally it would be bland for many movies if you can predict what's going to happen next but here Affleck directs the film with such skill, carefulness and confidence, you'll wonder whether a more experienced director is calling the shots. This is proof that while Affleck has improved as an actor, he may be a dominating force in the director's chair in the near future. Affleck handles the action sequences in a focused, simple and realistic fashion, there's no unnecessary explosions and no extreme blood squibs. But when the shootings starts, the tension is cranked to the maximum. It is handled with just the right amount of tension and violence.Overall, it is a simple story told extremely well with a great acting ensemble, splendid shooting sequences and top-notch direction. This is not an action movie but I was hooked from beginning to end. I know this may be too soon but if Affleck keeps up this streak and choose movies that is of his true caliber, than Affleck may very well be on his way in following Clint Eastwood's steps as a popular actor but an extremely talented director as well. This is one of the year's best films.Overall rating: 84/100",7,0,1,12 December 2010
Shutter Island," I can't look away...
","Finally, a horror/thriller that actually, genuinely scares the crap out of you. Not because it has fancy villains in masks or sadistic buckets of gore throughout. No, it scares you because it messes with your mind. Most will hate this movie, they don't like their brains being tampered with. I loved it. It's what we needed after all those gory R-rated and sometimes lame-duck PG-13 horror crap-fests.The horror/thriller genre has been raped lately, with gore and scantily clad- women replacing the noir and terror that Alfred Hitchcock perfected in the '50s and '60's. Here director Martin Scorsese delivers in full blast, crafting a thriller in his own unique vision. The atmosphere throughout the movie is tense and unsettling. Slow as it may be, but it is crucial to the movie and it's genuinely gripping. Your attention WILL not be lost. The scenery is beautiful and finely done with no excessive lighting, grain or darkness. The editing by Thelma Schoonmaker is fluid and pitch-perfect, and never makes the film lose focus. The movie is based on a book by Dennis Lehane and is packed with twists and turns that will leave you breathless and uneasy. The movie cranks the breathlessness and uneasiness up to the power of 5. The music is also perfectly suited with the scenes. There is sometimes no music during suspenseful moments, and sometimes the music makes the scene even more disturbing and memorable. Alfred Hitchcock's noirish thriller style is back with a vengeance, here to teach today's moviegoers the REAL meaning of suspense and horror.All the actors in the movie are in top-form. Once again, you can't go wrong with a Leonardo DiCaprio/Martin Scorsese collaboration. As the protagonist, we the audience are thrust into his shoes and we are about as confused and scared as his character is, we feel what he feels. It becomes a psychological trip that poses many, many questions about oneself, that to discuss them here would spoil the entire movie. There are some flashbacks in the movie, but all of them are important clues to DiCaprio's character. DiCaprio gives a stunning performance, once again tempting the Academy to give him another Best Actor nomination. DiCaprio gives a vivid portrayal of a vulnerable, haunted and ultimately terrified man. Apart from DiCaprio there's really not much I can say about the supporting cast, because they are all also terrific. Ben Kingsley; Mark Ruffalo; Michelle Williams; Max Von Sydow; Jackie Earle Haley; Emily Mortimer; Patricia Clarkson; Ted Levine; Elias Koteas; John Carroll Lynch. All of them.In short, this is a psychological and frightening masterpiece that will make you scared, will make you think, and will make you seek psychological help. This is one of the best films of the year. See it, go in with an open mind and prepare to be blown away.Overall value: 9/10.",8,221,305,16 April 2010
Tangled," Vintage Disney.
","I was quite skeptical of this because I thought the Golden Year of CG- Animated films ended with a not-so-big-bang with the decent 'Megamind'. After a year which brought you 'How To Train Your Dragon', 'Toy Story 3', 'Despicable Me', and 'Legend Of The Guardians: The Owls Of Ga'Hoole', can there really be any other CG-Animated films of that caliber?'Tangled' miraculously continues and ends that streak (at least for this year alone) with a big bang.There is nothing wrong with liking a movie which is out of your personal tastes. Yes, 'Tangled' may look like a typical kids film on the poster, but I am glad to say that this film is a strong return to form for Disney Animation Studios.Even if it is CGI and even though the film bases itself around another fairy-tale princess, it is done very well. It is made clear that everyone involved in the film cared about the material and wanted it to reach out to everyone. They succeeded brilliantly. Everything that you loved in an animated Disney film is here in full force. Disney has never been this good since the 90's. Pixar is excluded - they're in a world of their own.Take for example, the characters and actors. Rapunzel looks cute and adorable, Flynn looks handsome and dashing; and the villains look menacing. Yet, underneath it all, the voice actors bring out the dimensions in the characters. A very versatile Mandy Moore makes Rapunzel a sweet and innocent girl yet one who is full of adventure and determination. Flynn, voiced by 'Chuck''s own Zachary Levi, shows dry wit and vanity at times, and also self-actualization later on in the film. The other voice actors do their part just fine, especially Donna Murphy as Mother Gothel - a selfish and cruel new addition to the Disney villain club.While the story/screenplay was written well for what it's worth, the music by Alan Menken truly displays his signature Disney trademarks, the grand music, the catchy songs, the emotional ballads in the middle. I'm not surprised if it gets an Oscar nomination at the very least, knowing Oscar.Well, there, I've said it. I really enjoyed 'Tangled', its extremely like-able main characters and it's fantastic visuals enveloping a classic fairy tale, it is a real welcome return to form for Disney, and I really hope it continues to go down this way. This one is a definite must watch for the families, a new 'Princess' classic for Disney.Overall rating: 75/100",6,9,12,10 December 2010
Oblivion," 2013: A Cruise Recall
","No sooner pass the one-hour mark, does Joseph Kosinski's 'Oblivion' turns from an intriguing sci-fi premise into a 'guess the other sci-fi movie winks' game. It was a bit of a letdown, having so much potential and then letting the screenplay take the easy way out, by catering to the audience. A superior screenwriter would have explored some of the interesting idea to its extent. Here we are treated to a slick, slam- bang futuristic actionier that treads on familiar territory but looks and sounds fantastic.If you got something, go for broke. This is only Kosinski's second feature film after the equally visually spectacular 'TRON: Legacy', and he goes for broke with the visual effects and design of the movie. There is an awesome sense of scale and sights of breathtaking spectacle throughout the movie, and I'm not just talking about the action sequences - most of the film's establishing shots will make some hairs stand in awe. And unlike today's CGI-laden films from MTV directors, with choppy editing and all; Kosinski wants his audience to appreciate and savor the effects, so we get them in long, wide shots with a patient duration.If there ever was a director as visually creative and epic in his use of effects, Kosinski may be the go-to guy for such a movie, seeing that James Cameron or George Lucas may be busy with other projects. Hell, it's clear Kosinski cares about how his movie looks, and basically you get more than the price of the IMAX admission. Yes, the IMAX version is the way to go for this one. I simply cannot imagine seeing this movie again on a smaller screen. The visually stunning world Kosinski has created is worth more than the price of the IMAX edition alone.Alas, if only the script were as daring as its visual scale. It's based on Kosinski's own graphic novel, and I've counted major influences from 'Total Recall', Tarkovsky's 'Solaris' and Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey', among a few others. Yes, the ending is simplified Hollywood pap, but the visual journey to there has been nothing short of amazing. Hell, at least Kosinski has the gall to put in references to Kubrick and Tarkovsky, so it's all good. And Tom Cruise as the engineer Jack Harper, reminds me of those good-looking, manly heroes from the golden years of science fiction - handsome, intelligent, and ready to act when necessary, with Olga Kurylenko supplying enough weight for her obligatory love interest role. Even Morgan Freeman shows up to prove he ain't just wise, he can kick ass too.It appears the trailers have revealed far too much of the visuals. I simply do not understand the marketing for films today. Do they want to market the movie, or show you most of it just so you can pay 11 bucks to see the ending? I wisely avoided watching the trailer (although I heard them) and it allowed me to imagine what kind of visuals that may come up on the screen. Needless to say, I was not disappointed with what I saw.",6,0,1,20 April 2013
Burn After Reading," Ingenious, hilarious dark comedy.
","Another winner for the Coens. Continuing their tradition of making comedies after dark crime thrillers, such as their previous magnum opus 'No Country For Old Men', the Coens create another trademark Coen dark comedy.This time they're out to poke fun at espionage, the writers/directors dream up some stuff most of the Hollywood filmmakers wouldn't even dare to dream up! This film, like it or not, makes smart people look dumb, much to my delight. Be warned this film is not for those without a cruel sense of humor.It's hard to find a weak performance in the movie. All the actors were perfectly cast in their role. Tilda Swinton, John Malkovich, and Coens' regulars Frances McDormand (and surprise, J.K. Simmons) deliver great performances. Standouts, however, are George Clooney (in a huge turnaround from his usual cool persona) and especially Brad Pitt. Pitt gave me the most laughs from anyone else in the film.In short, this is one of the funniest and freshest comedies of 2008, and also the funniest Coens film since 'The Big Lebowski'. Highly recommended for the serious moviegoer in need of a laugh.Overall: 8/10",7,3,6,5 March 2009
Watchmen," Completely blew me away.
","'Watchmen' is a visual feast from start to finish. But not just that; it is also an excellent film overall, because of a terrific screenplay, stylish direction and great acting. It is one of the VERY best superhero movies ever made.The actors are rightly cast as their respective characters. Akerman is drop-dead beautiful as Silk Spectre, but she shows that she can act, too. Patrick Wilson, as Nite Owl, perfect for the part. Billy Crudup as the haunted and mysterious Dr. Manhattan, emotionless and chilling, is just spot on (and daring, he's naked in almost every scene he's in). Matthew Goode as the brains of the Watchmen, Ozymandias, quite right for the part. The standouts, however, are Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach and Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the Comedian. Both are the two most interesting characters in the movie, and, having such flawed backgrounds and human traits, pull off their roles perfectly.Very rare have I seen a mainstream film having such complexity in it. It has slow moments, but they're gripping. The story is devoid of any superhero movie cliché, and (especially for newcomers to the graphic novel) steering away from audience expectations and going for surprises. Be warned, the film has several 'what-if' questions presented to the audience, so it may be hard to digest for some. It is deep, it is fascinating, it is gripping from start to finish. True, it is an adaptation of the graphic novel by Alan Moore which I haven't read before. In fact, I had absolutely no idea of what 'Watchmen' is all about until this film. Which is why I was completely blown away by the film.The screenplay is brilliantly executed with style by director Snyder. This is Snyder's film, his personal project, and he really puts his heart and soul into making his dream come true. All I can say is, his hard effort paid off in full and he made the film into his own. Most of the action sequences are chock-filled with dazzling visual effects. Snyder also adds some classic songs to synchronize with what's happening on the screen, and it is done perfectly. Instead of the rapid-rock music and fast pace we got in 300, here Snyder allows us to enjoy the beautiful visuals due to the slow but absorbing pace. The film has a dark theme (thanks to the direction, the beautiful cinematography and Tyler Bates' brooding score) from start to finish, and there is graphic bloody violence (not to mention sex) in some scenes, so this film is definitely NOT for the kiddies and NOT for the squeamish. It is a full-blown movie MADE FOR MATURE AUDIENCES ONLY.Newcomers will have to be open minded to fully appreciate the raw power and sheer brilliance of the film. It can stand on the 'podium' along with 'The Dark Knight'. A viewing in the local cinemas is a MUST. This film is destined to be an instant success, so skip the Satan-like Jonas Brothers 3D crap-fest and show he kids what REAL ADULTS go to see. I'm not sure whether it is loyal to Moore's graphic novel since I haven't read it, but I did read his previous 'V For Vendetta' novel, and I think he would be pleased with this film. I see a huge future for all actors, with Akerman, Wilson, and Crudup getting mainstream Hollywood success, while Haley and Morgan would get Oscar-worthy roles.Overall: 9/10",8,2,6,7 March 2009
The Killing Fields," There's nothing to forgive
","Roland Joffe's 'The Killing Fields' is a nerve-shredding full film of power and emotion. The facts that the film is not based, but an actual true story, coupled with the knowledge that star Haing S Ngor was an actual Khmer Rouge prisoner, makes it impossible to turn away from the screen.Sam Waterston's performance as the determined turned guilt-ridden reporter Sydney Schanberg is good, but the show belongs to Ngor whose compelling performance gives us not only a person we care about but also a realistic, real human being, thrown into horrible circumstances of outside causes. If anything Ngor's terrific performance can be the sole reason of this film's raw power and brutality.But there is more to watch in this human film. Mike Oldfield's great, suitable score which perfectly suits the action without getting too dramatic or too subtle. The stunning cinematography which shows the horrors of war amidst the beauty of Cambodia. Terrific production value showing atmospheric, realistic locations filled with thousands of extras, a feat reminding me of the days of David Lean, only less joyous and much more terrifying given the context.I cannot recommend this brilliant film enough. Actions speak louder than words, so go see this as soon as you can, and prepare to be moved immensely. The use of John Lennon's 'Imagine' is perfectly suited.Overall rating: 91/100",8,2,3,8 January 2012
Man of Steel," Superman Reborn
","Zack Snyder's 'Man of Steel' opens with a stunning sequence set on the dying planet Krypton involving Jor-El (Russell Crowe), trying to preserve the Kryptonian race via his newborn son, Kal-El. I put emphasis on Snyder because this film has his stamp clearly all over it, try as the marketing department might to fit in Christopher Nolan's producing credit in every trailer they can get. But no matter.If there was one thing I could pin Nolan on for this film, I would say, the mood of the film. This is definitely not your daddy's and grandaddy's Superman, or for that matter not your older brother's. Like 'Batman Begins', emphasis is put on mood and atmosphere, with the lighthearted and campy factors virtually scrubbed out for a slicker, more down-to-earth feel. Unlike Nolan's reboot, though, 'Man of Steel' opts to take a more action-oriented approach for its hero. And boy, do I mean action.Once the action lands on Earth, the audience is immediately whisked off alongside the now adult Kal-El, or Clark Kent (Henry Cavill), as he ventures alone on his quest to eventually find a certain (not-so) solitude location, while intrepid reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) investigates that very same one. Along the way well-timed flashbacks offer glimpses into Clark's youth and inspirations, most notably his loving Earth parents Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane), who sufficiently provides as much inspiration as they can to properly shape up Clark as he nears his destiny.I say sufficient, because 'Man of Steel' paces itself thunderously with gigantic and spectacular action sequences from start to finish, giving little time for the audience to breathe. The admittedly bare-bones plot is made way for some truly awesome sights to behold, showing quite possibly the most honest depiction of how powerful Kryptonians can really be if they really, really want to.I deplore 'Transformers' for the very same reason I recommend 'Man of Steel' - that is, non-stop action. This is because the former repeats an outdated formula that is aggressively forced onto the audience, while 'Man of Steel' embraces its action sequences with style and technique. I usually deplore the excess of CGI in action sequences, but here I'm making an exception because this movie really shows that CGI can be used positively to create sights previously unknown to man, (a feat not seen since 'Avatar', perhaps?). Buildings fall, planets explode, large objects are flying in the air, all done before, yes, but Snyder and his talented crew are probably influenced by Biblical catastrophes for their sensational action sequences. Imagine that.Snyder has a firm grip on action sequences, and injects them with such energy that one would think he drank a gallon of adrenaline and decided to show it through this film, but again, his crew is key. The marvelous production design by Alex McDowell, which includes the planet Krypton is given a major rehaul and now resembles something Lovecraftian, made me grin at the details and atmosphere created. Amir Mokri's framing of the action compiled with moody, muted colors makes it hard to not awe at the sheer spectacle unfolding while gasping at sights at the same time, and Hans Zimmer's rousing score keeps the film moving at a high tempo while pausing occasionally to take a breather.And what of our film's star? Cavill fits Superman to a T, he looks and sounds exactly what Supes would, but given the emotional mood of the whole movie, he manages to act convincingly in those emotional scenes. He looks like he has a bright future ahead. Michael Shannon, a character actor who is rising rapidly in his field, is intimidating as General Zod the villain, but most good actors can play the role well. As for the rest of the cast, they all deliver solid if unspectacular performances, though it was nice to see Costner on the big screen again.This is what I wanted to see in a comic book adaptation. Retaining the essence of the Superman character while wrapping sensational action sequences around a moody and Gothic atmosphere. It's no 'Dark Knight' in terms of depth and character, but it doesn't even try to be, and it still works. Of course there will be a sequel. There will be a Justice League movie while they're at it. Hell, I'll be there if they can make it as rollicking as this.If I were to pick between this and 'The Avengers', there is no question. I'm sorry, Marvel fans. Just my honest opinion.",6,1,4,15 June 2013
Trouble with the Curve," Lightened up Mr. Eastwood
","'How the hell do you know I'm lucky to survive?'Legendary screen icon Clint Eastwood returns in front of the camera since his hit 'Gran Torino'. No matter what anyone else thinks of him, I will always admire the man. He is one of my heroes. Who else can personify the action hero perfectly, become a gifted filmmaker, improve his acting ability as he ages AND be quite the jazz musician?Mr. Eastwood may be old but he still has a commanding presence on screen. Granted, he might be the only leading octogenarian in Hollywood right now, but still, I digress. He is old. That is a fact. At the age of 82, seeing him play an elderly man losing his sight while bonding with his distant daughter makes it quite sad for me to watch. However, 'Trouble With the Curve' is a breeze to watch.It is not a baseball movie, although baseball is the basis of the film's story. Nor is it a depressing drama (Mr. Eastwood's favorite genre of late). It is a father-daughter bonding dramedy, with some great chemistry between Mr. Eastwood and Amy Adams as his estranged daughter. Justin Timberlake also arrives to lighten up the atmosphere even more, and his presence is welcome in the film.Mr. Eastwood is not in the director's chair this time. His long-time producer partner, Robert Lorenz, makes his directorial debut with this film. Apparently Lorenz directs the cast with ease although it feels too by-the-numbers. But hey, there are much worse debuts. Judging from the breezy pace and the somewhat brisk editing and lively cinematography, it's clear from the get-go that the superb 'Eastwood touch' is not evident in the film, even though some of Mr. Eastwood's key players are still here - cinematographer Tom Stern and editor Joel Cox - though the music by Marco Beltrami (not Mr. Eastwood nor his son this time!) complements the atmosphere pleasantly.Look, this is not a great film. It's a pedestrian and predictable film, with Mr. Eastwood, Adams, Timberlake, as well as an impressive supporting cast featuring John Goodman and Robert Patrick, phoning in the performances. Both Adams and Mr. Eastwood have acted much more superbly in better previous movies ('Gran Torino', 'Million Dollar Baby', 'The Fighter'). But it is funny, it is sad at times (Mr. Eastwood's heart-wrenching singing of 'You are My Sunshine' is forever embedded in my head), and it is easy on the eyes, ears and mind, a relaxing pleasure to watch. It is great entertainment. From all the big- budget blockbusters out in cinemas last summer, this is a joy. You'll walk out smiling.Overall: 70%",6,70,92,21 September 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," A strong beginning to a grand finale. The best film of the franchise so far.
","It should be wise for people to at least watch the first six films in order before watching this one, if they haven't read the books already.With this film, we are slowly but surely bidding farewell to one of cinema's most successful and imaginative franchises. The franchise, like Harry Potter himself, has grown and matured as the years (and films) progress. Part I of the 'Deathly Hallows' is ultimately a strong build- up to what will be a triumphant, bittersweet finale for everybody.I won't waste time trying to talk about the performances, because they are all great and powerful in their own way. Never mind that many of the cast members are very talented veteran British actors (try getting John Hurt, Alan Rickman, Ralph Fiennes, Brendan Gleeson, David Thewlis, Michael Gambon, Helena Bonham Carter, Imelda Staunton, Jason Isaacs and Bill Nighy in the same film again) - the three young actors who we have come to love and care for following the first film a decade ago, basically carry the franchise on their shoulders, and this film is no exception. Radcliffe looks handsome, Grint looks gruff, and Watson looks gorgeous. They've grown into fine young people.Screenwriter Steve Kloves doesn't forget to add the mood and gloom to the story as it slowly unfolds, but then again he adds some light humor to the film when it needs it. Bonus points for making this not only a visual spectacle, but also a character-driven ensemble; there's some complex characterization here. Also there's some action which aren't seen on screen, but mentioned by the characters. It's OK, because it's necessary for the brisk pacing, and it's not really that important anyways. Besides, the human mind can imagine these images far more powerfully.There are many themes in this film. Sacrifice, determination, (obviously) friendship, and above all - acceptance. As the films progressed the films started to gain an increasingly dark momentum - signaling that all hope may be lost. But in the end, will good triumph over evil? Like the film, real life isn't so sure. Also, the fact that the actors and crew are moving on after a decade of making these films - it's also another way of acceptance - the films have ended, they're moving on for the better of their lives/careers. It's real life, and I wish all these promising young actors brilliant lives and careers ahead of them.'Hallows: Part I' is many parts thrilling, as there are quite a number of intense action sequences. Many of them, of course, are done with well-rendered visual effects, and in this one they just blend in at a natural level without being too jarring. However, the action sequences are perfectly blended in with the gripping, dramatic moments. They don't feel heavy handed and it's beautiful to look at. The animated sequence about the origins of the Deathly Hallows is an absolute masterclass and jaw-droppingly beautiful to both watch and listen. If separated by itself it can win an Oscar for best animated short. The crew also get their due here. David Yates has gotten a firm grip on the film's direction since directing the fifth and sixth films years ago. The cinematography is stunning and exquisite, and it gives off a certain moody hue to the film. The editing is also crisp, it's not choppy when it doesn't need to be. Alexandre Desplat's score really makes a difference, it literally puts you into the world with its beautiful, harmonious, and emotional tones.In short, I would have to say that this film is the best 'Harry Potter: film yet in all honesty. I grew up with the series, and as per the actors, it will be an emotional goodbye. But rest assured, the finale will be grand.One more thing. This interpretation of the novel is the best one yet. The novel is done justice, something not seen since the first three films. It's something for both the fans and novel-readers alike, as there are some pieces only book readers can discover while watching the film. It's definitely a huge improvement over 'Half-Blood Prince''s adaptation, which for me is the worst Potter film.Harry Potter is a phenomenon. But, like all things, it most come to an end eventually. This is the beginning of the end, and I wouldn't have it any other way.Overall rating: 75/100P.S.:Eat your hearts out, Twi-hards.",7,242,359,16 November 2010
Knowing," The most surprising, exciting, and thought-provoking science fiction film since 2006's 'Children of Men'.
","I'm not sure what I just saw. I went into the cinema expecting a cliché-ridden film with great special effects and the usual Hollywood fare, nothing more, nothing less. Oh, and Cage trying his best to still flaunt his haunted action hero persona.How happy, in both cases, was I to be proved oh so utterly WRONG, because 'Know1ng' is NOT your usual Hollywood cliché-fest, instead it may just very well be the most surprising film you've seen in AGES, if not ever. Why? Because it is fun, hugely exciting and entertaining to watch, and at the same time makes us think deep. Very, very deep.The acting, while the only thing maintaining anything Hollywood, is above average. Cage delivers a surprisingly great performance as the hero, the professor who tries to solve the puzzle and save lives. He is a standout in the film, and I can finally say that he has redeemed himself after that unintentional laugh-fest called 'The Wicker Man'. Everyone else is just fine, but the kids' acting are the only minor flaw - their acting is, there goes that word again, clichéd.In terms of storytelling, it succeeds in every count. The story starts out as simple, typical Hollywood fare. Expect the usual clichés for the next 100 minutes, or so I thought. Now imagine that every cliché you can think of being thrown out the window, or rather, blown up to smithereens. Yes, this film not only challenges the clichés by the film's second half, it completely destroys them. People, this is the disaster film we've all been waiting for. It keeps you on the edge of your seat even after the apotheotical ending. The ending...oh God... I can't say it, although I know a lot of people will be divided over it. You're gonna have to see it for yourself to believe it. I'll give you a hint though - think Neon Genesis Evangelion.The technical aspects of the movie is also excellent. Director Alex Proyas... I liked 'I,Robot', I absolutely LOVED 'Dark City'. This is close to 'Dark City'. I can proudly say that 'Know1ng' is one of Proyas' very best films. His direction is taut, kinetic and intense throughout the film, and he does have a visual eye for some scenes. The tone of the film is dark and suspenseful, and that's a good thing. The special effects are terrific. For a US$50 million budgeted film the special effects are nicely handled and very believable. Accompanying all of this is Marco Beltrami's (yay!) music score which fits the movie really well and sets the overall mood for the film. Especially when he uses a piece of classical music for a powerful scene.This movie raises a lot, and do I mean a LOT, of questions. If I explain them here in detail it will spoil the movie. The questions posed are bleak, disturbing, and mind-bending. This film has not got me thinking like mad since 'Children of Men' three years ago.I walked into the cinema hall expecting a fast-paced, popcorn munching good time, to be hugely entertained by Nic Cage and his heroic antics to save the world. I got much, much more than I bargained for. Good thing, because I spent the entire week haunted and thinking about the movie. I'm still thinking about it even as I type this review! And I think most people will too.Thanks to the rightfully misleading marketing campaign, the public are in for a treat. This is a film that deserves the success, and it has to be seen and appreciated for a long time. I'm sorry if the review does not sound like it's giving the right rating, but believe me, if I had to review it in full detail I'd have to spoil the movie. This film is an absolute jolt to the eyes and head, and with scenes that will leave you talking, thinking and guessing, this movie is one of the greatest disaster movies ever made, it should be placed alongside Irwin Allen's earlier hits. Go see this movie, you won't be disappointed. Cage is back in top form, and he'd have Proyas to thank for that.Overall: 9/10",8,3,8,24 March 2009
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," My favorite movie.
","This movie is a rarity - if you manage to catch it on TV while channel skipping, you don't change the channel anymore; you just SIT DOWN AND WATCH. That's the commanding power of this film. It has something for everyone - young and old, for the typical summer movie lover to the hardened film critic, this movie has it all.There are so many, many things that I like about this movie. Firstly, there are the action sequences. They are big, grand and spectacular in every sense. Since this is an Arnie/James Cameron movie, you know it's gonna be big. From the storm drain chase to the Cyberdyne police shootout, it is massive. Hordes of stunt-men are present here. You can tell they are dedicated when doing their job. #1 rule of action movies - always have a LOT of stunt crew around.Next, the acting. Arnie is used to being Arnie, but instead of that, and also the creepy, relentless killing machine in the first film, here we see him as a worthy hero and protector, who will do anything to protect John. Some moments in the film shows the Terminator's humanization, an element which gives the movie more credit. To which I recall 'Arnie, do your stuff'. But, truth be told, Arnie gave a better performance as the villain in the first film than in this. Linda Hamilton is also highly commendable as Sarah Connor. In the first film, we see her as the damsel-in-distress, in this one, she's a gung ho commando mom who will do anything to protect her son. This also shows that she is a changed woman, both physically and mentally, as her adventures in the first film have shaped up into this Sarah, and we can't help but cheer for her. Edward Furlong also gives a charming performance as young John, who develops a strong father-son bond between his cyborg protector, an element which serves as the emotional theme for the movie. And, who would not review this movie without mentioning Robert Patrick's chilling and menacing portrayal of the seemingly indestructible and invincible T-1000? The cinematography is great. Adam Greenberg really picks the right scenery for the film to make it feel more 'epic'. The city of Los Angeles have never looked this wide. Also, the night scenes were incredibly shot, especially during the Cyberdyne shootout. The dark scenery is joined with a great dark yet heroic atmosphere which gives the film yet another one of its key elements, although frankly speaking, in terms of atmosphere and mood, my vote goes to the first Terminator movie, no contest.The music - Brad Fiedel returns to give us not only his signature synthesizers, but also to give a new orchestral arrangement for the heroic tone of the movie. His score is fantastic, and the music fits the right places at the right moments. I wish I could hear more of Fiedel in the near future.This movie wouldn't have been possible without the special effects and makeup. This film is one of the first movies to fully take advantage of CGI, but only, repeat, ONLY, during scenes with the T-1000. This is great, because limited CGI means more time for real pyrotechnics, gun-play, and vehicular play as well. VERY unlike the films made today, an example would be Transporter 2. So stylized and so unrealistic. Thankfully, and possibly hopefully, Hollywood have learned its lesson and will probably continue making old school action films, with action films like 'Live Free or Die Hard', 'Casino Royale' and recently 'Rambo', which are all done old school style. That being said, the CGI in the film looks terrific and does not at all look aged. The makeup effects are also good, with realistic metal skull revealings. Both these elements easily surpass the first film.Finally, I would have to comment on James Cameron, who wrote, produced, and directed this blockbuster. He practically delivers fast-paced, kinetic direction, and knows how to build up tension as well. As for the story, some may criticize it for being too redundant to the first (which I agree), but I think that Cameron has done a tremendous job for turning the dark and moody atmosphere of the first into a rip-roaring, no holds barred action adventure. And, giving us moral insights and predictions of machines turning against their creators. Really, if not for Cameron, then who? Overall, I think this is one of the finest films ever to grace the silver screen, and as of today still stands as a colossal and grand masterpiece few can beat. However, in that said few is the first Terminator, which is better than this film.But that's just me being a harsh critic.Now, being the little kid I've always been, this is my favorite movie. I first watched it on VHS when I was 6 years old in 1997 and since then I have watched it more than a dozen times and I never get tired of it. It's a film that will probably never grow old or outdated. This movie not only sparked my interests in movies, but also made Arnie into my favorite action hero. This film is the reason why I've decided to pursue my dreams into becoming a film director (after seeing the hard work and dedication the filmmakers put in while watching the documentary in the Ultimate Edition DVD), and also why I continue loving movies today. This movie is an inspiration to us all, and I strongly recommend anyone - anyone at all, to watch this film. This film, one or not on its own, is a masterpiece.10/10Delton.",10,13,18,12 April 2008
Salt," James Bond, Jason Bourne and now... Evelyn Salt?
","Sorry, but I still prefer Charly Baltimore (Geena Davis) from 'The Long Kiss Goodnight'. She is still the ultimate kick-ass heroine for me, followed by Ellen Ripley from the 'Alien' quadrilogy. But Angelina Jolie still can carry an action flick, and it certainly shows in this one. It's way better than her 'Tomb Raider' movies.From start to finish 'Salt' is action-packed and leaves little to no time for dramatics. It's all about Jolie and the action. Briskly paced at 100 minutes and with perfect, fluid editing time flies by as you become entertained at what's happening at the screen, no matter how preposterous it is.Preposterous? Why yes, there are some (note: SOME, not all) overdone moments, and some plot devices that are too far-fetched to be believed, but we're entertained too damn much that we never really notice. It's like the right movie to see after becoming mind-screwed by 'Inception' (which isn't a bad thing); a Panadol for the brain.Jolie is perfect for the role, showing cold emotion and ruthlessness in all her scenes, especially the action sequences. Kurt Wimmer who wrote the script did a nice job tailoring Jolie for the role. Liev Schrieber and especially Chiwetel Ejiofor are also great in the roles that they portray, with Ejiofor giving a tough performance which is the polar opposite of his worry-wart character in last year's '2012'.What I like about this movie is the constant guessing game the film presents to the audience. At times the film become too predictable, but at times it isn't. Kurt Wimmer weaves these in to his action-packed script that is filled with intrigue and danger, although I wish some of the twists were more original. The premise is nicely written and not overblown though, and that's a good thing.Having said that, I must commend the filmmakers for getting this done (even Roger Ebert said it): bringing back the Russians as Hollywood's favorite villains. Ever since the cold war ended we've been bombarded with a variety of politically correct villains such as Arabs, North Koreans, South American crime lords etc. Russian villains has always been a favorite with Hollywood: just look at the early James Bond films and even 'Rambo: First Blood Part II' and 'Rambo III', mainly because of their dangerous nuclear capabilities, but in most of these films they're depicted in a cartoonish fashion. 'Salt' not only brings the Russian villains back from the dead - it makes them believable.Who else but Phillip Noyce can direct a film with such tension and fluidity with ease? I've been an admirer of Noyce ever since 'Clear and Present Danger' and he is a great thriller director, and this film somewhat proves it, albeit a somewhat physically absurd one. Physically absurd because, as mentioned earlier, some of the action sequences are preposterous. But they're well-directed thanks to Noyce. The cinematography also frames the action well, with the cameraman NOT afflicted with Parkinson's (Is Hollywood returning to STEADYcam?) The music score by James Newton Howard suits the tension and rousing action of the movie perfectly, and the production design is classy,In short, it's everything a popcorn action movie is. Don't have too high expectations and you'll be pleased. It's a fun ride from start to finish, and I recommend it for a fun time at the movies without too much overkill.Entertainment value: 10/10Overall: 7/10",6,3,10,29 July 2010
Collateral," One of the best thrillers in recent years.
","Max (Jamie Foxx), a taxi driver, falls victim to Vincent (Tom Cruise), who takes him hostage so that he could complete five hits in one night in the city of Los Angeles. With a basic plot at that, one could think about how predictable the show would become.Thankfully, it doesn't.Thanks to a solid script and masterful performances by Cruise and Foxx, the movie is saved from losing credibility. Mostly a character-driven movie, Collateral is a throwback to the old Noir genre of the 50's, and we get it with a modern and masterful touch, kudos of director Michael Mann, who, no matter what, seem to inject flair and energy into his actors. I mean, just look at Heat! Notice how intense Pacino and De Niro were acting. This shows how good his direction can be.Cruise steals the limelight of the show, something he could not quite achieve during the previous years. Here, he plays a cold-blooded villain for the first time, and he makes the character into his own. He has believability and that look of viciousness in his eyes. In fact, I myself did not believe that Cruise was playing the hit-man until 50 minutes into the movie. It is with strong belief that Cruise was robbed of even an Oscar nomination.Jamie Foxx is also excellent as Max, the cab driver. His character is an ordinary human, an Average Joe, that is suddenly thrown into the world of crime and violence the moment Vincent steps into the cab. Foxx also delivers credibility into the role, making us wonder what would he do next, as Foxx's character represents us, the regular, normal, audience, who is experiencing the fear that he is while watching the movie.Supporting actors are also good here. Mark Ruffalo delivers a credible performance as Fanning, who is investigating the five hits. Javier Bardem is superb as his brief portrayal as Vincent's employer, Felix. And Jada Pinkett-Smith is good in her brief performance as Annie, a lawyer who is dropped off by Max right before Vincent steps in.The storyline is basic, but it's the screenplay that compels us. The lines are sharp and crisp, and made even more believable when executed by the actors. The tension is there, and it makes the story more human. Layer by layer, minute by minute, the story unravels slowly and in a steady pace, so that the audience is able to understand the situation and become engrossed in it.The action sequences are handled nicely. Superb camera work and editing. They are loud, fast, swift and brutal. The best example of such a scene is the climax. I won't spoil it for you, see it for yourself.The direction, as mentioned earlier, is superb. Michael Mann adds another classic movie to his resume. Here he adds his elements into making another one of his masterpiece, that made 'Heat' great. Overall, he really injects life and credibility into the movie, giving such realism and flair in the picture.The cinematography is handled also superbly. Here, Mann shot the film in HD so that we would be able to see night-time Los Angeles in all its glory. Add a haunting score by James Newton Howard, and you have an atmosphere that is gritty, urban, and most of all, realistic.Overall, a breath of fresh air from the now not-so-original Hollywood, and one of the best thrillers for the new millennium. Kudos to Cruise for giving an outstanding performance and to Mann for making an old story seem new.A must see.8.894/10Delton",9,10,15,4 December 2007
Captain America: Civil War," Avengers Disassembled
","Marvel's 'Captain America: Civil War' is a film so sincere in its aspirations, so determined to stand out from the superhero crowd, that to see it collapse under the strain of its ambition is quite underwhelming. The film pits Avengers Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) against each other in a clash of ideologies, and to see them fairly debate in lieu of individuality and regulation, respectively, is nothing short of compelling and thought-provoking, especially since both sides have their own set of consequences.The action sequences and fight choreography are top-notch, probably the best in the Marvel crop, with the Russo brothers proving themselves the studio's golden goose. They (with mightily impressive stunt choreography from the John Wick directors) direct with a slick, brutal efficiency and perfect comic timing that can make action junkies sigh with relief, which aides greatly in that big, highly-hyped superhero throwdown.But the villainous cog behind the conflict nearly collapses the entire film. It becomes increasingly preposterous the more I think about it. To pit Cap'n and Iron Man against each other, there has to be a plausible catalyst towards their tension to bring any real emotional weight to the film. This villain, all by his lonesome, uses preparations and tactics that would make Bane and MacGuyver blush in comparison, resulting in plot/continuity holes so big a dozen helicarriers combined can fly through them. However, and this doesn't spoil the plot, what he does at the end of the film ditches the core of the film and resembles a Saturday morning cartoon.It's still a better film than Batman vs. Superman.",6,18,37,18 May 2016
The Conjuring 2," A better and scarier film than the first
","The 1977 British haunting known as the Enfield Poltergeist has sparked controversy and has been accused of being complete hogwash. The famed paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) have now got their work cut out for them with this one. But director/co-writer James Wan is not concerned about busting myths. The guy wants us to be scared silly and have a ball. He has succeeded. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. That's the modus operandi of Wan's latest scare-a-thon, the sequel to the 2013 summer blockbuster. This is better than the first – bigger, scarier and much more intense. The first film was fun, but it relied too heavily on nostalgic and retro traits, having aped/paid homage to 1979's 'The Amityville Horror'. This new one is no different – it acts as a 'greatest hits' album of classic horror movie moments – specifically, those of 'Poltergeist' and 'The Exorcist'. Wan's passion for the genre shines through in every scene. His unnerving atmosphere soaks the film in a shroud of doom and gloom, relentlessly unleashing his old- school house of horrors until the curtain call. It creaks, it moans, it shrieks when need be, never short-changing the character development and audience in the process.This is not the horror film of the year so far (that honour belongs to the haunting indie film 'The Witch'), but as far as popcorn horror films go, this one's really good - and a good stepping stone to introduce newcomers to 'Exorcist'-style classics, a trait which I suspect was Wan's true intention all along, having already establishing himself as today's go-to filmmaker for spooky films.",6,0,1,9 June 2016
Tropic Thunder," Excellent satire, funny and witty as hell.
","With 'Tropic Thunder', star/director Ben Stiller and company turns the tables at Hollywood, making fun of it in almost every aspect. From the wily-minded executive to the desperate measures of stereotypic actors, this film has it all.Stiller and Black play their parts well and pull it off being funny at the same time, Stiller playing a stereotypic actor so desperate he went 'full retard' on a film that almost sank his career; Black playing another stereotypic comedy actor whose basis is only on fart jokes, and so desperate he takes some you-know-what. But it works too.The main attractions, however, are Downey and Tom Cruise. Downey is remarkably hilarious in his role, the method actor Lazarus, playing as if he was born a black man. Cruise is also as excellent as the foul-mouthed Grossman, a somewhat sharp poke at The Weinstien Brothers. Really, it's all good.The film is mostly filled with satirical jokes that are all spot-on. From the starting fake trailers we have a rap star promoting consumerism, an action hero in way too many sequels, a gross-out comedy that appeals to today's audience, and a highly potentially controversial art film. Nothing is spared as Stiller and company proceed to jab at all of Hollywood and movie-making's faults, and their proud of it. The dialogue is sharp tongued and hilarious.So, if you are looking for a funny film with a sharp satirical message, you must watch this film. It is exceptionally funny and shows us the ugly, somewhat true side of Hollywood at it's worst.Overall value: 9/10",7,1,4,21 December 2008
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Stands out on its own with its unique blend of media genres, but not for everybody
","It seems to me that many people do not 'get' this film. A friend of mind called this movie 'juvenile' and 'immature'. I think he missed the point of the movie completely.Now I'm not going to waste my time commenting on all the performances, because for a teen/college love story they are perfect in their supposed way. Michael Cera, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, everyone in the film is perfectly cast and they fit into their characters like a glove, as well as the chemistry between them which is evident throughout. Scott and Ramona's chemistry in particular is kind of cute.Nor am I going to talk much about the screenplay, which is not-quite- unoriginal, it's absurd, yes, but it is as it should be, and the openness with some Hollywood-taboo themes such as homosexuality and directly/indirectly cheating is quite a first, the screenwriters deserve commendation for that. Not forgetting the dialog which is hip and urban as it should be.No, this film is purely about the visual style and this is where it succeeds. An amalgamation of multiple media genres, such as film to video game to music video to comic book to alternative rock music and then back again. It's really loopy but it's done in a tastefully and deservedly flashy way. There's changing aspect ratios, onomatopoeia (the 'WHAM' and 'BAM' in comic books in case you don't know), health bars, flying people, weapons coming out of nowhere, awesome rock music, virtual comic books, 1UPs, you get the idea. It's THE film for the video game generation, and it is very proud of it.By using this, 'Hot Fuzz' director Edgar Wright manages to combine the said teen love story screenplay above with this visual style, and using his frenetic and lively direction, he transforms what would be an ordinary teen film into an extraordinary visual experience. Note that this multiple genre mash can turn people off, as evidenced by the poor box-office returns this film has recouped.I don't know whether it was Wright or Universal or both to decide whether to bring the film (based on a Canadian graphic novel, no less) to life and to this fashion but it was a solid, and to me rewarding, effort. It's as if you're watching a real video game come to life, and the hip soundtrack and unique visuals all help you enjoy the experience even more. I'd call this a successful experiment and let's see more from Wright and company.Overall this will definitely be a cult favorite, no doubt. I surprisingly enjoyed the thrill ride (however absurd and surreal it may be, it's still exhilarating and hilarious) and this film is ultimately a unique one which has to be seen to be believed.Overall rating: 75/100",6,2,7,12 December 2010
Die Hard 2," Not excellent, but still a worthy sequel.
","John McClane is back. This time he;s awaiting his wife at Dulles International Airport In Washington, D.C. at Christmas Eve. But a group of mercenaries take over and shut down the landing area of the airport until their demands are met. So what will McClane do? What else? Nothing but kicking terrorist butt! Willis returns in this sequel to the action masterpiece Die Hard. Here he is as energetic and as witty as in the first movie. You gotta hand it to Willis, he's like the only actor who acts stereotypically and we still enjoy it no matter what. Yes, it's that stereotypic action hero we love no matter what!! He also delivers the godlike line here.William Sadler was also a good, but not great, choice for the lead villain, as his character is a cruel bad-ass. He's like a buff kung-fu kicking dictator, who goes around crashing planes as he pleases. Also, it's nice to see Robert Patrick in his pre-T1000 years, as a henchman, but at least he had a line, and a good one, too. Dennis Franz was okay as the airport security chief, Fred Thompson was good as the Head of Air Traffic Control, as per others.The action scenes look bigger, but some not better than the first. The claustrophobic tension is gone, as it's no longer a building, it's an entire open-space area that is under control. Also, the budget is considerably bigger this time around. Bigger stunts. Bigger explosions. Bigger plot holes. But still, Renny Harlin still directs some pulse-pounding, if not absurd, action sequences. Accompanied by a great Michael Kamen score, and a still-great screenplay from De Souza. Also, the editing is quick and flashier than the first, as it was done by Stuart Baird, who would later direct the excellent thriller Executive Decision, also involving airplanes.Still, while not quite living up to its predecessor and the story is an almost direct-replica of the first, it is by no means bad and it is still a worthy sequel for Die Hard.6.9/10Delton",8,2,4,13 October 2007
Quantum of Solace," Undeniably the best action film of 2008. Bond is back with a vengeance.
","With the betrayal and death of his lover Vesper Lynd, a grief and enraged James Bond flees from both his allies and enemies in order to uncover and destroy the mysterious group known as Quantum, the group responsible for Vesper's betrayal and currently trying to stage a coup in Bolivia in order to control the country's water supply.In short, James Bond is out for revenge, and is certainly bringing an ass-kicking with him.Whereas Craig's intriguing debut in the excellent Casino Royale stunned audiences and critics alike; in this outing, he is a lean, mean, killing machine, with a charming yet brash, flawed personality and on a quest for vengeance. Still a novice 00-agent, Craig shows he has the chops, both in acting and physical terms, to bring Ian Fleming's most cherished character to a whole new level. His rage, his fury, it's all there in his eyes, and possibly, in his fists and legs as well. No, really. Here he runs, kicks, punches, runs and kicks some more, flips... you name it, he'll do it. Kudos to Craig, who is close to toppling Connery as the best Bond. Gone are the unrealistic days of Pierce Brosnan and Roger Moore.Also on the fast-rising scene is Ukrainian Bond girl Olga Kurylenko as Russian-Bolivian agent Camille. She also has a grudge against Quantum's chief. Kurylenko is admittedly gorgeous and spunky in her role and proves that she is also capable of some action on her own as demonstrated in some scenes in the movie. She could very well be the next Sharon Stone. Not too far behind is Mathieu Almaric, who is deliciously creepy and menacing as the villain, Dominic Greene. Here he personifies the hidden agenda of mass corporations today and he pulls it off with such conviction you'll almost fall for his words. He is one of the best things in the film. Gemma Arterton is delectable as the other Bond girl, charming agent Fields. Rounding off the supporting cast is returning actors Jeffrey Wright, Giancarlo Giannini, and the ever-reliable Dame Judi Dench as M.Cinematographer Dennis Gassner's work is reminiscent of Ken Adam's lavish settings of the 60's era Bond films, with exotic locales such as Panama (doubling for Haiti and Bolivia), Italy, and the Atacama Desert in Chile, being used in all their glory and in a grandeur fashion, the latter metaphorically showing Bond's rigid emotions (as explained by the director). Not only that, it also has moments of pure grittiness and bleakness. Accompanying the cinematography is David Arnold's fast paced yet classical orchestral score, which is grand and exciting at times. The theme song by Alicia Keys and Jack White, however, is the low point of the film as it is too 'rock-like', and not suitable as a Bond song.However, much praise to the script and the direction. The story is the driving force of the film, and while admittedly the action upstages the actors, the story still shows and there is quite a lot to indulge in. The direction is where it gets his highest merit. Marc Forster, having directed arty-films like 'Monster's Ball' and 'The Kite Runner', shows off his knack and flair in his fluid and solid direction of the film and makes the film his own. It's a complete 180 turnaround than what Forster has ever done before, and he proves that he is a guy capable of directing action films. He should be on the front-list for Bourne 4. The movie is chock full of kinetic action sequences that engages the viewer and it has them all, fights, gunfights, car chases, even a boat chase and a plane chase is thrown into the chaos for our enjoyment. This film is pure rock-em', sock-em, no-holds-barred action. The CGI (God was merciful on that) is not overused, with hordes of genuine and painful stunts galore, and it is a good sign that old-school action movies are back with dominating force at the movies.In short, it is a great film and addition to the Bond saga (while still close behind Casino Royale), with its intense, explosive nonstop action, dark, moody atmosphere and dramatic performances. It will have a position in my Top 10 James Bond films. If you like action, do yourself a favor and see this movie. Daniel Craig proves that James Bond 007 is back, with a vengeance.Overall value: 7.4/10Delton",6,58,112,24 October 2008
No Country for Old Men," '...and then I woke up.'
","A film that lives up to its reputation and then some, 'No Country For Old Men' is a revelation in modern-day Hollywood. No big budget. No special effects. Just raw, bleak film-making at its finest. The Coen brothers have done something here, arguably their best film to date. Quite really, this film blew me away.In this film, hunter Llewelyn Moss finds a suitcase of drug money at the site of a drug deal gone bad between Mexican and American dealers. The American criminals then hire psychopathic assassin Anton Chigurh to kill Moss and retrieve the money. Meanwhile, Sheriff Tom Bell tries to put the pieces together, but is disillusioned by the truths of the present.You see, this is not a simple cat-and-mouse chase thriller, nor is it a bleak and ultra-violent neo-noir. Instead, it is a wake up call to the world, the world of violence we live in now, where everyday somebody is killed without reason. Without sense. And the bad guys sometimes do get away with it. That is the sad part of it.Before I'll get melodramatic, I'll start by saying that everyone's performances were superb, especially Javier Bardem. He deserved his Oscar. Anton is a relentless, merciless, twisted psycho that has absolutely no regrets and no hard feelings towards anyone, be it his client, his target, his target's contacts, his rival, or even a total stranger. He will just take your like even with pleas of mercy. His character Chigurh here represents the angel of Death, the Grim Reaper, who takes the 'souls' of people who calls their fate. It's a mesmerizing and revolutionary performance, one that I dare to call one of the most sinister and deadly villainous performances of all time.Josh Brolin is also excellent in his role as the protagonist, hunter Llewelyn Moss. He is a man who knows what situation he will get into, yet he bravely takes risks that may endanger his life, as well as the life of his loved ones. Moss character is brash, and attentive to the happenings around him. Brolin's performance was a vital key factor for this film's success and had Bardem not stole the limelight, Brolin would. This is his finest performance to date and I have yet to see him in bigger roles, much likely as President George W. Bush in an upcoming Oliver Stone biopic.Rounding out the main cast is Tommy Lee Jones, playing the disillusioned Sheriff Bell. He is fed up with all the violence happening around him and seeks a way out of this. Bell represents the previous generation lashing out at today's level of extremism. We are tired, and we want to end it as soon as possible. But how is it going to end, we ask? It was Bell who said the 'comment opener' at the end of the film, his voice and eyes filled with sad remorse and heartbreak, it just gets to you, knowing that you want something and you get the other way around. It's just heart-wrenching.The supporting cast is also great, kudos to Woody Harrelson and Kelly McDonald for their great performances as Chigurh's rival hit-man and Moss' wife, respectively, and also to Garrett Dillahunt as the Sheriff's Deputy, providing little comic relief to this dark and disturbing drama.Adapted from a Cormac McCarthy novel, the film's screenplay is also masterfully written by the Coens, with some of their trademark dialog in places. Their direction is much praise, from showing off the beautiful cinematography of the countryside, to what was one the Wild West; to a suspenseful nighttime silence in a border-town in the middle of the night. There are some violent scenes, and they are brutal and shocking at best. The film's slow pace is not a problem as it takes time to fully understand what is going on. Also, sparing the use of music is brilliant, it really sets up the tension and the mood for the film. The short music itself is haunting; Carter Burwell's themes are bleak and gritty.In short, it's nothing more than a movie miracle. It deserved the Best Picture Win at the Academy Awards, and it definitely redefines the neo-noir thriller genre. It is a masterpiece, and one that may linger on freshly in some people's thoughts for years to come.Overall Rating: 9.3/10Delton",10,2,5,26 September 2008
District 9," Excellent no-nonsense sci-fi actioner...
","Going into the cinema I had mixed expectations as I only saw a handful (yet interesting) posters and only one trailer. I only heard a handful of reviews yet all of them came from this site. Well, I decided to hedge my bets and walk in anyway. And I'm glad I did.'District 9' is a wallop of a film that is also one of the year's very best films. It perfectly presents the balance of human emotions and CGI mastery. The acting is top notch and believable, and the characters are so realistically presented; even the protagonist is deeply flawed, and during some scenes I wonder who should I root for.The story is well told; a refreshing, unique and somewhat original scenario, one that we've never experienced for quite some time. The atmosphere is bleak, dark and realistic, actually making me believe this thing can actually happen here on Earth.The special effects are excellently rendered, and actually give more than their money's worth (Only US$ 30 million! And the effects were amazing, as great as anything WETA has done before!). The creature effects are so realistic we could not tell the difference. Thanks to none other than WETA for this amazing feat, and I hope they get an Oscar for visual effects. But the practical effects are believable too, as per the engaging and thrilling (and also non-stop) action sequences in the film's second half. And boy, those weapons are awesome! Special mention goes out to the fluid editing. Example, first half of the film works like a docu-drama, and the second half becomes a hybrid of Black Hawk Down, and we don't notice the change of pace. It's that brilliant.Peter Jackson really knows how to pick a good story and director when he sees one. And I want to shake Neill Blommkamp's hand if I meet him. He is certainly a talented director, and one to look out for in the future. (P.S. If that Halo movie is still going on, Blommkamp has proved that he is the man for the job) In short, it's an excellent science fiction action film, but not without it's intelligence. It may have a few flaws and very few clichés (these happen near the end of the film) but it is still very solid nonetheless. If there is a sequel, I'll be first in line to see it.Overall value: 8.5/10",8,474,679,13 August 2009
Batman Begins," An Excellent Comic-Book-Done-Right Movie. One of the year's best films.
","The Superman trilogy came in this order; success-moderate-moderate-flop. Having seen the fantasy world of Tim Burton's Batman and Batman Returns; and Joel Schumacher's horrors Batman Forever and Batman & Robin, I thought this one would flop as well. Instead I was introduced to a new kind of comic book adaptation.Having seen this in the cinema was a real delight. It doesn't have corny dialog and fantasy-like buildings. Gotham City looks that way its supposed to be. A crime-infested megalopolis. Superb A-list actors only play second fiddle to Christian Bale (Empire Of The Sun, Reign of Fire) who give a very strong performance as a young Bruce Wayne, returning to Gotham after rigorous training. Kudos to indie film director Christopher Nolan (Insomnia, Memento) for bringing in such classy actors and bringing Gotham to a dark stage.The music in this movie is also haunting. Instead of Danny Elfman's original fantasy score and Elliot Goldenthal's throbbing but corny score, we get two very well-known composers. To those who know James Newton Howard (Dreamcatcher, The Village) and Hans Zimmer (The Last Samurai, Shark Tale) they are very talented in keeping the atmosphere of Gotham as dark and mysterious as Batman.With its dark atmosphere, unexpected twists, strong acting and dialog and some of the most thrilling action sequences ever filmed, I give Batman Begins a strong overall rating of 8.87/10.Rated PG-13 for intense violent action, brief drug content and language, and for some disturbing images.",8,1,1,13 October 2007
Wreck-It Ralph," When the arcade closes, the games come out and play...
","While watching, I chuckled aloud in the theatre hall, already packed with kids, their parents, and accompanying couples enjoying themselves. But there is a fourth demographic this animated movie is aimed at - the video gamers - and I suspect that most of the audiences are/were gamers themselves at one point in their life. I know I was.Which was why I was pleasantly surprised at 'Wreck-it Ralph', Disney's latest CG-animated film, and most certainly there will be more to come. It's an enjoyable treat for kids and adults alike, and if they were avid gamers, extremely nostalgic to see some of the mechanics and characteristics come into play here, if they manage to get past the cameos of other real game characters.When the arcade closes at night, the games and the characters come to life, interacting among one another. Ralph (appropriately and charmingly voiced by John C. Reilly) is the villain of the (fictional) classic game Fix-it Felix, Jr., and so desperately wishes to be beloved and respected as the hero Felix (Jack McBrayer, whose voice fits Felix to a T) is. When he gets rejected, he leaves his game, in one out of many creative ideas, to look for the sacred hero's medal.How the screenwriters used this familiar plot device ('Despicable Me' and 'Megamind' were two years away) and incorporate it into a series of fantastical and imaginative ideas is pure movie magic. They have created a living, breathing fantasy universe within the video-game realm. I can imagine the number of kids/video game fans screamingly excited at the mere thought of it, and it's brought to life vividly here. It's not everyday you see Bison and Zangief from Street Fighter, and the ghost from Pac-Man, discuss among each other 'Why Being Bad is Good' in an Anonymous-style meeting.Ralph doesn't want any of it. And so he 'game-hops', from a 'Halo'- styled sci-fi shoot-em up led by the spunky Sgt. Calhoun (Jane Lynch) to an anime-influenced, syrupy racing game where Ralph meets Vanellope, a feisty but adorable glitch (Sarah Silverman), who is banished by everyone in the game, especially King Candy (Alan Tudyk). One thing leads to another and before you know it, the fate of the arcade rests in the hands of Ralph when enemy bugs from the sci-fi game, which only knows how to consume and destroy, ends up invading the candy racing world.Sure, I've seen this story before. But this is a fresh, lively and colorful spin to it, thanks to writer/director Rich Moore. The visuals and animation are crisp and top-notch, and the styles of animation and various character designs pull you into the gaming universe even further. Even the difference in game generations is humorously poked at by a terrified Ralph in one scene. The music by Henry Jackman really helped to underscore the zany goings-on throughout the movie. Of course John Lasseter had to be involved. 'Toy Story' in a video-game world. And it works.I really enjoyed this animated movie a lot more than I expected to. It was funny and exciting at times, it was bright and colorful, and it had a proper and cohesive story to fit the universe, something other video- game to movie adaptations had problems doing. It even has a likable and charming hero (yes) and some really fun supporting characters to boot. Both 'Megamind' and 'Despicable Me' tried, but this is the clear winner.Overall: 78%Another thing. Go early to see a very charming, classic-like short called 'Paperman'. The whole thing is in glorious black-and-white.",6,1,2,5 December 2012
Saving Private Ryan," Glorious and nightmarish.
","Words cannot describe the greatness of this film. Hell, if I type a long review of this film, it might take away the film's credibility. So I'm gonna keep this review short, sweet and simple.ACTING: Superb. Likable characters and they put you, the audience, smack dab in the middle of the war. Tom Hanks is outstanding. Notable mention is Jeremy Davies who does a great job portraying the contrasting soldier, Upham.DIRECTION: Excellent. Frenetic camera movement, thrilling and extremely realistic action sequences. Spielberg is masterful, as always. He manages to show the audience how nightmarish war really is.STORY/SCREENPLAY: Storywise, it is uplifting and inspiring. And during historical moments, it is accurate and realistic. Screenplay slips into sentimental state during times, but we'd look over that.CINEMATOGRAPHY: Mesmerizing. At times we look at the horrors of war with the nightmarish (there goes that word again) display of a blood-drenched beach and war-torn cities. The color modification really helps the effectiveness of the cinematography.MUSIC: Is put into places where it should be. John Williams does a fantastic job once again.OVERALL: In short, definitely in my favorite movies list, and on the critical side, one of the greatest movies ever made. This film deserves to be owned and watched by film lovers.9.966/10Delton",8,4,7,28 April 2008
Drive," The lone hero rides again
","In a time where explosions and CGI dominate the American box-office, we are grateful to have at least one film this year that challenges the clichés and brings it to a style of its own.That movie is 'Drive', which for my money is a beautifully structured and extremely well-crafted film.For anyone with doubts over whether Ryan Gosling can be a tough guy - the film blows away any doubts of that. Gosling is superb here as the nameless Driver, as his hero character is the perfect lone hero - a stranger who talks only when he needs too, who can exploit whatever he can however he can, and who never loses his cool no matter the odds - his stoic face hiding his emotions and determination. This silent hero is not too uncommon from Clint Eastwood's 'Man with no Name', or lately George Clooney in 'The American', but get him mad and the rage flies off from the screen and towards the audience - and he doesn't even do it shouting obscenities or other 'heroic' rage clichés. He's emotionless and speechless, and that makes him an even more dangerous, unpredictable, and (for lack of a better word) cool character.As for the rest of the supporting cast, Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston and Oscar Isaac provide emotional balance to Gosling's calm performance, and Albert Brooks surprisingly sheds his comic image to become a brutal character to great effect. Ron Perlman and Christina Hendricks' appearances are somewhat brief, but they are still very good in their roles.'Drive' is not exactly original. We've seen this 'heist-gone-wrong' story millions of times in Hollywood and other countries. But you can still make a great movie out of an overused story if you do it well, and 'Drive' does exactly that, and more. Director Nicolas Winding Refn's calm and focused touch gives the film a very old-school 'noir' feel that exudes a dark and sombre atmosphere throughout the film - like it came straight out of the 1970's (what with the gritty, sombre thrillers that came out during that era). He also controls his actors wisely, and the action sequences are grounded in reality and unpredictability, making it even more exciting and gripping to watch. Hossein Amini's script also fleshes out the characters well, showing that when they talk less they reveal more. It's these long pauses between conversations that makes a character, so the many instances of silence between Gosling and other characters showcases the best of his acting ability. Amini also is no stranger to old-fashioned thrillers, having already penned the nostalgic 'Shanghai' years ago - here he shows that he may be the screenwriter which can revive the noir genre.The violence in the movie is bloody, unpredictable and somewhat raw. Moments of silence are shattered with gunshots or the revving of the car engines. The car chases in particular are brief, but they reminisce the good old days of solid car chase movies like 'Bullitt' and 'The French Connection'. No CGI and no studio back-lot, no annoying music in the background, no shaking camera and no quick-cut editing - its old fashioned and that's the way I like it.'Drive' is gorgeous to watch. Newton Thomas Sigel's cinematography is sublime and crisp, painting Los Angeles in a bright orange tone during the day and drifting shadows and light during the night. Especially in the car scenes when the lights and shadows go past Gosling's eyes and the scene in the elevator with Gosling and Mulligan. His work along with Cliff Martinez's very transcendent and ambient electronic score, combining with Refn's direction and Gosling's mysterious atmosphere all contribute to the hypnotic atmosphere of the film. That, and the film's retro soundtrack makes for a very mesmerizing movie to watch. The film is edited nicely in a slow but moving and intriguing pace that makes one concentrate on a subject all the way without having to experience quick cuts all the time like some Michael Bay popcorn flick.'Drive' respects the audience and it makes them focus on the story and characters instead of the style that it is being presented upon. It makes you feel the film, and that's something that I don't experience often - you become engrossed in the characters' world and start caring for them instead of just awaiting the next big action scene.In short, 'Drive' is a great film. It's may be unoriginal in plot but it's beautifully crafted with class, respect and care by Refn, Amini, Gosling, Martinez, Sigel, and everyone else involved. It's old-school noir and it's a sign that the classic style of film-making is coming back. This is one mean muscle car of a movie.Overall rating: 85/100",7,4,8,8 October 2011
Insidious," Pure scares
","I think 'Scream 4' said it best when it comes to the state of horror films nowadays. It's all either torture porn or failed reboots of famous classic horror franchises (If they decide to remake 'Jaws' or 'The Exorcist' I'll never forgive them), or worse, dumb them down to PG-13 tween-friendly spooks that will barely raise an eyebrow for classic horror fans.'Insidious' does not follow today's trend. It's not gory or bloody, it does not have sex scenes or too much foul language. The PG-13 rating is justified. The movie's sole purpose, like many horror movies, is to scare the crap out of us. And it does. Brilliantly. Using good old fashioned scare tactics without making them cheap - remember the cliché where there is incidental music build up to a probably scary killer/ghost only to cop out to a scared animal or whatever? Nope. None of that here. The music comes strictly when it scares you. The non-music parts greatly serve to build the tension so high to the point that you can cut the tension with a knife. It's old school. I like old school.In fact, it's so old school with the delivery of the scares, that one may mistake the film for being stuck in between the 1970's or 1980's. Director James Wan and writer Leigh Whanell, together with producer Oren Peli, probably fashioned the film to be a homage to the great spook horror films of the past, most notably 'Poltergiest', with bits of 'The Exorcist', 'The Shining' and Peli's own 'Paranormal Activity' thrown in for very good measure.A script which is a homage to other films can either sink or swim. This one swims, because Whanell uses the classic scare elements and removes the clichés. Wan directs with caution, going mostly against audiences' expectations. The actors play their role straight as per the crew - Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson are very good in their roles, and Lin Shaye is a bit creepy as the medium who helps them. With the music by Joseph Bishara effectively eerie at many parts and some truly spooky production design and camera work, Wan's tense direction propels a homage script into their own - a great, solid horror flick that does exactly what it's supposed to do - scare - brilliantly.Look at the horror film directors of the past. John Carpenter. Wes Craven. Tobe Hooper. The granddaddy of horror Alfred Hitchcock. Even Sean Cunningham has a cult following. Does anyone familiar with horror films remember names like Samuel Bayer or Nelson McCormick? Granted, Alexandre Aja and Neil Marshall has done some fairly solid stuff, yet Eli Roth to be honest tries too hard. James Wan isn't up there with the greats yet, but if he keeps up this old-school trend without copping out, he just might very well be. I'm just saying.This is great stuff for a horror film. This was how scary movies were made in the past, this is how it still should be.Overall rating: 80/100",6,5,9,20 May 2011
Bolt," Disney learns from its past mistakes. Great!
","Yes, it has seems that the comeback of good-quality family movies from Disney is near. Having learned their mistakes from duds such as Underdog and The Shaggy Dog, Disney presents to you ANOTHER dog movie... but wait! This is a whole lot different and better in every aspect. Taking a new premise with a predictable story is no surprise, but the filmmakers add heart and soul to it, thus making it another Disney classic.Take the characters for instance. Their designs and voices are so convincing to the audience; it makes them cute and lovable as ever, and makes you just want to hug them. Travolta adds likability to the title role, and surprisingly, so does Miley Cyrus as Bolt's owner/co-star Penny. Susie Essman adds wit to her feline character and that hamster is just very funny.The cinematography is great, the special effects a treat for the eyes, and the music score by John Powell is rousing. (Coincidentally, during Bolt's 'mission' in the beginning, Powell's score contains shades of his Bourne scores).Overall, a pleasant surprise from Disney and definitely a step up. A must watch in the cinema for a fun and great time with the family and friends.Overall: 8/10",6,2,6,7 December 2008
2012," With 2012, Roland Emmerich is the new 'Master of Disaster'
","Volcanoes. Tsunamis. Earthquakes. These are natural disasters which have movies of their own. In 2012 Roland Emmerich throws all three of them in, and then some. It is a roller-coaster of a movie from start to finish, and an immensely entertaining romp.The story is the usual 'group of survivors trying to survive' type with the usual disaster movie clichés and pseudoscience (as if the 70's never happened), but what makes it special is the more human touch to it, thus making us care for the characters. Sure, there are some cringe- worthy and 'are-you-kidding-me?' moments (more of the latter), but both of them are overwhelmed by the disastrous spectacles on the screen. The film may drag at parts but that's just a breath-catcher before an even bigger disaster occurs. Oh, and in each disaster people of all kinds are perished; men, women, children, elderly, religious and political leaders, EVERYONE. Very few people are spared.The movie has a strong ensemble cast who look like they're having a blast. Cusack and Harrelson are the best actors in the movie. Ejifor and Glover are care-able characters, especially the former. Thandie Newton and Amanda Peet are OK but I felt that their characters are given little to do other than to whine and act as a love foil. And Oliver Platt gives a very sleazy performance, that's what he does best.On a technical level, the film is near-flawless. The special effects are stunning and eye-popping (although overblown), and in my opinion topple every summer movie this year; 'Star Trek', 'Transformers' (admit it), 'G.I. Joe', 'Terminator', and 'Harry Potter'. I feel that it deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Visual Effects and Sound Effects, even if it doesn't win. The action sequences are nicely handled. Emmerich knows that some parts of the action are over-the-top, so he handles it in a subtle tongue-in-cheek manner, making it even enjoyable. The intensity of certain scenes are there, and you can't help but feel sorry for the billions of people who perish. My favorite disaster scenes are the sinking of California and the Yellowstone eruption. In fact I think that Emmerich purposely filmed some disaster scenes as homages to the disaster films made or inspired by the previous 'Master of Disaster' Irwin Allen; there's 'Earthquake', 'When Time Ran Out' and briefly even 'Poseidon'.Also, the music score by co-writer Harald Kloser and scoring partner Thomas Wander is perfect for the movie as it captures the true spirit and awe of the movie.In short, I think that this movie is trying to be the mother of all disaster films; while not exactly succeeding that, it does manages to deliver some of the most awesome destruction scenes ever on film. It manages to be a near-excellent disaster film, not just one of the best ever. You don't really need to understand the Mayan prophecy rumor to fully understand it, nor will you become a believer of it after watching it. What I can guarantee is, that you'll have a blast watching this Hollywood blockbuster. This is not to be missed on the big screen as the disaster sequences are worth the price of five movie tickets alone.Roland Emmerich, you are now crowned the new 'Master of Disaster'. If this is really your final disaster movie, congratulations, you have outdone yourself. He can be proud of this film. Bravo.Entertainment value: 10/10Overall: 6.5/10P.S. I think that Emmerich purposely camped up the tone of the film. Had it not became campy and instead became dark and brooding, the 2012 believers (and believe me there are a LOT of believers out there, some so die-hard that they are willing to kill themselves before the coming 'apocalypse') out there will give us some more headaches to think about. So relax, check your brain (and pulse) at the door, and enjoy this blockbuster.",6,1,7,13 November 2009
Cars 2," This is PIXAR's worst film. Meaning not bad by usual standards.
","Once in a while, top-notch filmmakers and/or big stars take a break from making their usual brilliant passion projects, and go to do something fun, just to lighten their brain before preparing for the next big thing. James Cameron had 'True Lies' in between his epic/sci-fi extravaganzas. Before 'Unforgiven' Clint Eastwood made the buddy cop thriller 'The Rookie'. Edward Zwick who is known for his big-scale action epics like 'The Last Samurai' and 'Blood Diamond' made the sexually charged comedy 'Love and Other Drugs' last year. The best example is probably Steven Spielberg, who can balance crowd-pleasing blockbusters 'Indiana Jones', 'Jurassic Park' to hard-hitting historical dramas 'Saving Private Ryan', 'Schindler's List', 'Munich'; and still have room for more.PIXAR is no different. However, most of the critical backlash seems to be programmed disappointment for the sequel to arguably PIXAR's weakest film, at least before this. Granted the first 'Cars' wasn't as excellent as PIXAR's other efforts, but I appreciated the 'small-town values' message it was trying to convey.Right off the bat let me start by saying that 'Cars 2' is PIXAR's worst film by far. But 'worst' by PIXAR's standards is 'OK' for overall movies. It's still watchable and enjoyable, though not as heartfelt, emotional or intelligent as previous PIXAR outings such as 'Up' and 'WALL-E'. PIXAR just wants to have fun. Let them.The thing that turned off the critics the most is the blatant change of pace from the previous film. 'Cars' was a drama about appreciating small town values. 'Cars 2' is an exciting fast-paced action-adventure in vein (and possibly in tribute) to the gadget-laden Roger Moore/Pierce Brosnan James Bond films. It does not have a heartfelt message. It does not try to do so. It aims to entertain. And I admit, being a James Bond film fan myself, it was very fun to watch.The story shifts focus from Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) to Mater this time, though I wonder what the executives were thinking giving Larry The Cable Guy the lead in a PIXAR movie. But never mind. Mater comes across as goofy and dim-witted as usual, but at some points I felt as if PIXAR was going to Dreamworks-type humor.Having said that, I did enjoy Michael Caine, Emily Mortimer and Thomas Kretschmann as the new key characters to the franchise, and some of the action sequences are indeed exhilarating. Helped by solid voice work, fluid animation, gorgeous scenery that looks like the perfect travelogue, and frenetic and engaging music by Michael Giacchino (why hasn't EON Productions hired him for the next Bond film yet?) all combine to make a fun summer flick that entertains.Critics have found 'Cars 2' to be a tad too violent for kids. The James Bond movies (before Dalton) and the 'Indiana Jones' films were mostly rated PG and had a variety of spectacular and dangerous stunts and innuendo and had people dying too, and yet families still bring their kids to watch (no wonder why the darker and more cruel 'Licence To Kill' flopped). 'Tom and Jerry' had the two fighting and bashing and blowing each other up in almost every episode, yet kids still watch (and love) that. 'Cars 2' is no different, though I fear the backlash may be started for giving this a G rating instead of a PG.But then, I have to criticize it for having poor characterization, a cookie-cutter story, some lame jokes and having almost no strong moral message like PIXAR movies usually do. Thought the 'alternative fuel' was a nice touch though.This blockbuster is good for parents who are willing to introduce their little boys to the James Bond films. Apart from that, let's hope PIXAR has had their fun and go back to serious business. The kind that makes another 'WALL-E'.Overall rating: 60/100",6,1,2,29 August 2011
Unknown," Implausible at a few parts but it kept me engaged throughout
","The lessons I learned after watching this movie - one: never leave your briefcase at the airport. Two: Mercedes-Benz makes damn sturdy taxis. Three: Liam Neeson continues to be a badass even when he's nearly 60.'Unknown' is mostly a mystery thriller - Liam Neeson's character awakens from his coma after an accident to find out that someone else has taken his identity - and nobody believes him. The plot weaves through the streets of Berlin and some shady characters - with the all too typical thriller lesson of not trusting anyone.The film is briskly paced, there are slow moments but every 10 minutes there's an action sequence liven up the film, and it's especially during the last half of the film that the action sequences pile up after another. The action is fast and brutal for a PG-13 movie, and is shot quite clearly without annoying shaky camera for the most part, especially during the car chase scenes, while the fluid editing completes the job by adequately pacing the film to be fast or slow if necessary.And then there's Neeson. Here he is surrounded by both old and new familiar faces. There's Aidan Quinn and Frank Langella as the people with mysterious vibes, and then there's Diane Kruger and January Jones as the lovely-looking ladies but yet there's something not quite right about both of them. German actors Bruno Ganz ('Downfall') and Sebastian Koch ('The Lives of Others') round out the impressive supporting cast, with Ganz commanding the screen every time he appears. But it is Neeson, his age becoming more visible as the years pass, still giving a high- energy and determined performance that becomes the heart of the film and thus cements him as an (late-blooming) action hero/star of this generation. He is believable in the fight scenes, and his humble charisma gets the audience firmly on his side.And yet this film has its ups and downs. On the positive note, Jaume Collet-Serra's direction keeps the actors focused and the action intense, with the cinematography of Berlin showing both its glamorous and gritty side, what with its blueish hue and whatnot. John Ottman and Alexander Rudd provide a tense music score to the action. On the negative side, some parts had me suspending my disbelief in certain scenes. There is a twist at the end of the movie which I admit did not really see coming, but it wasn't exactly original as I've seen this plot device done in another movie before.But overall, it's a very solid thriller. It gripped my attention from start to finish, and it kept me guessing on many occasions. It too, made me think a bit about the bad guys - how smart and terrifying their methods are to get what they want at the expense of other innocents. Will this win any Oscars, no. Will Liam Neeson fans love it, I guess so. Will this entertain, definitely. I wouldn't mind watching this again if I had the time and company.P.S. This would make a great advert for Mercedes Benz cabs in Germany.Overall value: 66/100",6,2,4,10 March 2011
X-Men: Apocalypse," X6: Judgment Day
","'Days of Future Past', the previous X-Men entry, had visions of a stark post- apocalyptic future ala Terminator, and now comes 'Apocalypse', taking cues from eschatological lore with its titular megavillain threatening to destroy all to achieve his own vision of grandeur, forcing the X-Men to unite as one to stop this fallen god. It's pretty darn good.Do not be fooled by its comic-book brand; this is a biblical quasi-disaster film disguised as a superhero film, chock full of thrilling action and urgent, no- nonsense heroics, something that is sorely lacking in most superhero films today (I'm looking at you, BvS and Civil War). Both movies lack the human touch that Singer has given ever-so generously in his films, making the X-Men grounded and human while blossoming with their gifts. The stark difference between this film and Civil War/the DCU shows during one particularly harrowing scene involving Fassbender's Magneto in a Polish forest, which elevates this into a real film with real characters. The humor seems natural, too, save for another scene of fine trolling involving audience favorite Quicksilver that is all too similar to his scene in the previous film.Still, despite a script that offers nothing new to the table, hats off to director Bryan Singer, proving himself yet again as the golden goose of the franchise, for delivering the superhero goods with balanced, kinda old-fashioned storytelling and a plethora of fine performances from all cast members, especially Oscar Isaac as its titular villainous anti-Messiah. It's very operatic, overtly theatrical without being hammy, and it contrasts nicely with the rest of the grounded characters, truly fitting for a villain named 'Apocalypse.'",6,2,10,18 May 2016
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A truly haunting, moving, and fascinating film.
","Brad Pitt makes his mark as an actor here as Benjamin Button, a man with a strange disorder - physically aging backwards. Along his emotional journey of life he encounters friends, family, loved ones, adventures, and most of all, chances.Rarely has a film keeps the realism intact while still sustaining the magic of it. Truly, David Fincher and Pitt have created a film that is leaps and bounds ahead of its time. Taking a strange and fascinating tale and making it into one of the decade's very best films is something of an accomplishment.Pitt, here, is an actor, not just a pretty face anymore. With the state-of-the-art visual effects at his hand, he pretty much carries the whole show. It is perhaps the first time since Andy Serkis' rendition of Gollum in The Lord of the Rings, that great acting has eclipsed terrific special effects. You genuinely feel and sympathize for his character, rooting for him all the way. Pitt owns the film, in short. He and David Fincher make a great team, and they look unstoppable to create more terrific films.For the supporting cast, Cate Blanchett plays the love interest of Daisy to great effect. Her tale with Benjamin's make them somewhat star-crossed lovers. I won't go that far into detail but you'll see much later into the film. Taraji P. Henson also shines as Benjamin's surrogate mother, who gives her son the support he needs. Not to mention Tilda Swinton as an early love interest.The screenplay by Eric Roth is excellent. Told from Benjamin's point of view with some highlights by Daisy, there are no clichéd dialogs to be heard, and the script is filled with equal moments of joy, ecstasy, sorrow, and understanding. Some dialog here is timeless and quotable, such as the film's tag-line; 'We are defined by opportunities, even by the ones we miss.' When you age backwards, you get more chances rather than missing it. I love that and wish for it, but sadly that is what movies are made for. And if that is what you've been thinking after or during your viewing of this film, then this film has succeeded.David Fincher is a tour-de-force of film-making. Straying away from gritty violent thrillers such as 'Zodiac', the unmatched 'Fight Club', and 'Se7en', he takes a bizarre love story, the most expensive budget he's faced, and crafts a film with such substance and flair that he adds quality to the film. There are moments in the film which make it obvious Fincher is calling the shots. The paced is slow, but this allows us to absorb and be infatuated with the characters. There is not one dull moment in the film. It is constantly gripping and re-watchable.Technically speaking, the cinematography and lighting is absolutely perfect; gorgeous to the eyes and senses, and while giving the right tone and feel to the film shows us director Fincher's trademark. Accompanying this is the beautiful and heart-wrenching score by Alexandre Desplat, which is absolutely flawless. The special effects are unique and well-made, and you'll find yourself confused to whether certain scenes were made with special effects or not. If you want to see actors when they were young this is the best rendition of effects possible, and I hope the future movies use more of this amazing technology to make their stars more bankable. The special effects deserve their Oscar for it is the best I've seen in any movie in 2008.In short, it is a beautiful, tragic, and terrific movie. It is certainly timeless and will stand the test of time, and hopefully, age well like fine wine (no pun intended). This absolute gem deserves the nominations it gets, too bad it was released the same year as Slumdog Millionaire.Overall rating: 9/10",7,101,157,24 February 2009
Transformers," One of the biggest surprises of Summer 2007.
","Michael Bay. When you hear the name, the words 'Armageddon' and 'Pearl Harbor' pop in your mind. Sure he has a bad reputation, but who could blame him? When he works, he's having fun, just like any other person would. So when he was announced that he was going to direct a live-action version of Transformers, the toy robot-cum-animated series, there was a serious debating issue over the internet.The critics couldn't be more wrong.Transformers is a huge crowd-pleaser. Undoubtedly Bay's best film to date. But this is due to his partnership with executive producer God... I mean Steven Spielberg, and manage to control a budget that is big but not as inflated as certain web-slingers and pirates we know. The special effects are amazing, the acting is good, the action scenes are spectacular, and plot holes are as abundant as craters on the Moon. Yet, this film turns out to satisfy almost everyone going in the theater: having a sh*tload of fun!!! When Sam Witwicky buys a new, or rather, old car, little does he know that he and everyone around him will be whisked away to a grand and epic adventure beyond anything imaginable. LaBeouf's acting in here is good, as he manages to show his funny side and heroic side. A I grew up with his show on Disney Channel, Even Stevens, from this film, I could tell Shia was on his way to the top. Among all the Disney Channel Graduates, he is the most successful of them all, and he will continue to be that way. After Indiana Jones IV, the name 'Shia LaBeouf' will mean box-office gold.Supporting actors are good too. Megan Fox was cute as the hero's lover. Tyrese and Josh Duhamel were great as G.I. soldiers caught up in another war. It was nice to see Jon Voight taking a role that suits him UNLIKE Baby Geniuses 2. The only thing that bugged me a little was Rachael Taylor and Anthony Anderson's characters. I feel that their character's existence does not explain much of the plot.I was really please that the producers got original G1 voice actor Peter Cullen as the Autobots leader Optimus Prime. That was probably the best thing about the casting. Hugo Weaving was a good replacement for Frank Welker for the villain, Megatron. Thee Autobots are good, the Decepticons are evil. That's all you need to know.Overall, I believe Michael Bay has given us a true 'Summer Blockbuster', one that will be remembered for a long time. It is supremely loyal to the original series, and then some. I recommend it with a big box of popcorn.8.15/10 Delton",6,1,4,13 October 2007
Million Dollar Baby," Mo chuishle
","'Million Dollar Baby' marks Clint Eastwood's 41st film as a leading star, 25th film as a filmmaker, 19th film as a producer, and - notably, second film as composer. Not that it matters, but I'm just stating this to assert the fact that Mr. Eastwood is truly one of the most versatile faces in the history of movies. Be it an action icon, call him an actor, a filmmaker or a musician, Eastwood has done it all, and in this film, does it all.I was 13 when this film came out, and I didn't see it upon it's release in the cinemas. Now, after having finally watching the full film, I now regret that decision.The story of a crusty boxing trainer and the woman who wouldn't give up her dream might sound right at home with the usual Hollywood sports film tropes, but Eastwood's subtle yet strong direction grounds the film into reality and plausibility. Also, it isn't exactly about boxing, although that is one of it's stronger themes - it is really about three people whose lives revolve around this sport - one who's good at it, one who really wants to be in it, and one who used to be in it. What were the Hollywood marketing department thinking when they were marketing this movie as some sort of female 'Rocky'? Seriously. Just watch the trailer. And never trust it.The story is told in a way that doesn't glorify it, nor underscores it. It's that nice balance that makes it very engaging to watch. The story takes a deep dark turn at the last third of the movie, which makes it harrowing and heart-wrenching to watch. I'll be honest. I nearly cried. And I rarely cry in movies. The turn of events could've been handled in an uninspired or overdone way but Eastwood is smart. He tells it as it is - without excess fat or meat. The result - the emotional effect hit me hard.The performances of all three main actors are superb, with Morgan Freeman as the gentle caretaker of the gym whose personality will make anyone easy to warm up to, yet there's a somewhat sombre aura emitting from him - made obvious in his narration. Hilary Swank is excellent here in a homely, humbled and confident performance as Maggie the determined fighter who would never give up her passion and her dreams - no matter what life throws at her - and no matter the cost. Her character is the central focus of the movie - but Swank does not over or under-act, she embodies the simplicity of the character perfectly and shines in the really subtle moments (Eastwood's masterful direction helped here). However, as Eastwood the actor I honestly have to say that this is the best acting performance of Eastwood. And I have seen both 'Unforgiven' and 'Gran Torino'. Eastwood here is terrific, he has that trademark grizzled personality during the first half with shades of darkness here and there, but during the duration of the film he slowly opens up to the complex and tormented man inside, until the last half of the film where Eastwood gives a revelation of a performance, channeling his character's demons from the past to create a very emotionally complex character. Eastwood was honestly robbed of the Oscar for Best Actor that night, not that that stopped him from winning the Best Director one, but hey. Paul Haggis (who would later win the Best Picture Oscar for 'Crash' the next year) wrote the screenplay with raw honesty, so that the dialog sounds natural and earnest, and not just actors reciting or improvising lines.Eastwood the composer scores a very beautiful, simple and yet haunting music score that is not overblown, but gets the job done very effectively - with help from his longtime conductor Lennie Niehaus. His theme for the movie 'Blue Morgan' is especially very beautiful and emotional. Tom Stern's cinematography is also masterful - loved the way that Stern casts dark shadows over the character's nearly rim-lit faces giving them an extra edge in character (and there are a lot of dark scenes). The fight scenes are quite engaging but they're almost nothing new like in any other boxing movie, although Lucia Rijker's presence as 'The Blue Bear' is quite unnerving.The subtler moments I really admire - Scrap's conversation with Maggie in the bar; Maggie's monstrously evil white trash family; Frankie's letters to his estranged daughter returned unopened every time; Frankie's message to Maggie - always protect yourself; and finally the phrase 'mo chuishle' (spelled incorrectly in the film - on purpose I think) - coupled with Eastwood's touch, give the film more power and credibility than it's supposed to.It's the simpler moments that makes a good movie great, and 'Million Dollar Baby' proves it tenfold. Had it fall under the hands of a lesser or more stylized filmmaker, it would've been melodramatic or cheesy. Eastwood has been in the business for more than half a century. He really knows what he is doing. And he tells it as it is, and doesn't hold back any punches. This film is indeed the best film of 2004 because it has it all - a great inspiring and yet harrowing story, great cast giving great performances, and brilliant direction from a true master. Is 'Million Dollar Baby' a masterpiece? Maybe, but it's definitely one of Eastwood's finest films - his best since 'Unforgiven'. One of the Oscar- winning films that I say truly deserve every award it won - and it should've won more.",10,1,2,27 August 2011
Ip Man," The best martial-arts movie since 'Enter the Dragon'. Donnie Yen is on top form and may be the next Bruce Lee of our generation...
","Forget 'Flashpoint'. 'Ip Man' shows Donnie Yen at his brutal best. Telling the story of Yip Man, the man believed to have popularized the martial art of Wing Chun, before and mostly during the Sino-Japanese war.Yen caught my attention after seeing him in 'SPL'. Then in 'Flashpoint', I was stunned by his moves, and thought he was the next Jet Li. Well, after this I think he may very well be the next Bruce Lee. I mean it! Not only injecting humanity and superb characterization, Yen also demonstrates his brutality when it comes to fighting. And boy, it does not get more brutal than this! Seriously, Yen's fists move like machine gun bullets. And he makes sure that his opponents are down for the count... at their expense, and our enjoyment. Definitely Yen at his bruising best.Other actors worth mentioning, Simon Yam and Hiroyuki Ikeuchi as Ip Man's business partner/friend and the Japanese General respectively. The former portrays Ip Man's comrade with heart, while the latter performs with steely resolve and honor. This is a film that is not just made with action, but a good story as well.The fight scenes here are arguably Yen's best so far, and the best in over a decade. People are getting beaten, martial arts duels are taking place, and blood is spilled. This is not an action movie, it's a kung fu movie. And it shows. Legendary kung fu star Sammo Hung brilliantly choreographs the fight scenes to perfection, and it looks like he's not going to slow down any time soon. The direction by Wilson Yip is slick and gripping as always, and he also gives the film a nice sepia tone to give feeling to the film.In short, great. This is a must-see for kung fu film fans to get their adrenal glands pumping. It's one of the best kung fu films of the decade. See it if you have the chance.Overall: 7/10",7,86,110,21 December 2008
Clash of the Titans," Terrific special effects; rushed story and action; waste of money watching it in 3D.
","Don't watch it in 3D. Why? Well because there's nothing special about it. A few moments of pop-ups here and there but that's it. Not even the magnificent Kraken or the giant scorpions can save this. As a reminder, this film was shot in traditional 2D and was about to be released when all of a sudden a little movie called 'Avatar' broke box-office records with its groundbreaking 3D effects. So in any studio head's mind, 3D = big bucks at the box office. So they decided to up-convert this movie into 3D for the masses. Big mistake.Why? Because it underwhelms the movie. Anyone expecting something remotely similar to 'Avatar' or the recent 'Alice In Wonderland' or 'How To Train Your Dragon' will simply be disappointed. These three films were made with 3D technology, 'Clash' simply wasn't. Therefore all you get is just depth of perspective, or dimensions behind certain objects and characters. That's it. The 3D version is a great disappointment.This review is mostly to warn people not to watch it in 3D. Now having said that I have to admit the movie itself was good, solid popcorn entertainment. Oscar guarantee may not be found here, save for the special effects, which are simply dazzling and terrific, and may just be the best thing about the movie that makes it worth seeing. The CGI is extremely well-rendered and well-amounted, delivering just the right amount without feeling extremely overused. Some notable scenes are the giant scorpion battle scenes and the final scene involving the Kraken. It (effects) is simply mesmerizing.The acting, while not reaching the heights of say, Pacino or Day-Lewis, is still adequate in my books. The larger-than-life San Worthington portrays the larger-than-life Perseus, a role that seems to suit Worthington well. Our boy Sam will definitely be in the Hollywood spotlight, and while this one is not that great compared to his efforts in 'Avatar' and 'Terminator Salvation', it is still Worthington that makes the movie as he has the most screen time than any other actor in the movie. The other actors are OK, with the exception of Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes, who chew the scenery when they're in it and they look like they're having a blast playing the two Gods.In technical aspects, Louis Leterrier's kinetic direction ups the film above it's choppy editing and action scenes, rushed story and unimaginative story outline. Yes I am aware it is a remake of a film, and like most remakes, this one is not that good as the original; it just have special effects. The characterization in the original is gone here, leaving only mostly two-dimensional characters trying to save the day in a limited two-hour time constraint. The editing does not help either, rushing from one character's fight to another's in about half a second. The action, while solid, concludes all too soon. And the music score by Ramin Djawadi is a little bit too modern for this sword and sandal fantasy. On a positive note the cinematography is sweeping and the costume and production design and value are top- notch, pulling you into the past and getting immersed in the setting.Despite some flaws, this new 'Clash of the Titans' is not the great blockbuster many hope to be, mostly due to the great underwhelming 3D effects, but it is still grand, fine Hollywood entertainment at its finest. Watch it on the big screen in 2D, and enjoy this fine offering of CGI dessert after a year of Oscar nutrition.Overall rating: 6.5/10 (Above average)",4,1,2,2 April 2010
2001: A Space Odyssey," Apothetical.
","A stunning, spectacular, psychedelic, intense, and fascinating trip into outer space, '2001: A Space Odyssey' remains not only the greatest science fiction film, but also one of, if not the, greatest films ever to grace our screens. I kid you not.Every shot is filled with beautiful scenery and effects (that are still impressive today), that will stimulate your mind and make you ask yourself the purpose of life. How? Why? You will have to see it to believe it. The best thing about this movie is that it is daring, DARING, to show such questions off in an abnormal manner towards an unexpected audience. 'Why are we here? How did we came to be? Are we creations of God? Are we our own God?'. Yes, it is as philosophical as they say.I am simply stunned at some other people's comments. Bored? BORED?! You say? Shocking. You are one of Hollywood's victims, watching most of their propaganda that either makes people joyfully glee or kicking each others' guts out with stupid comedy or political references shown in their films. No. Get a life. Watch this film. Ask yourself the meaning of life. Repeated viewings are required to get the full message. Each new viewing gives new questions and new answers. The slow pace of the film is necessary for you to absorb these questions and answers. Yes, this is a calling, told visually.What director Stanley Kubrick has done here is too good for mere words. He and co-creator Arthur C. Clarke became science fiction masters, right after this film, and it is easy to see from here. The film shows visually stunning sequences, mixed in with beautiful, harrowing and haunting music to create a spectacular, exquisite and wondrous event for the senses. This is not just any film, this is film art at its best.From the lavish set design that is all-too realistic, to the grim realization that it brings forth, this film is magical. A moment not to lose as you find yourself in the deepest chasms of outer space, from a space station to the deep end of Jupiter. Also, man's evolution is made evident with the Dawn of Man sequence, also masterfully interpreting primitive apes who use bones as weapons, then the famous 'jump cut' shows a nuclear/laser satellite over the mid-air bone. Showing a 'weapon of mass destruction' prophecy. It seems all too real now.Space exploration. The film was made in 1968, and is set in 2001. Although that time limit has come and pass, some, but not most, of the things shown in the film are not invented yet. It still shows that mankind still has a long way to go even after all those inventions and progresses, both in real-life and on the screen. The Final Frontier, as Star Trek would put it. Man may not conquer it. But we can experience its beauty.Technically speaking, it ticks all the boxes. The scope is wide. The effects are great. The cinematography is beautiful. The music is haunting. Keir Dullea's makes us feel for his character. The villainous HAL 9000 is cold and chilling to the bone, like the icy cold of space. The direction is mesmerizing. The script sublime. The shocks genuine. The chills up your spine it brings. The majesty of it all. Who am I kidding? Word's simply will not do this piece of art justice.If this does not gain a position in the Top 20, never mind the Top 250, I urge you movie fans out there to see this film. It's an absolute must. If you don't, consider yourself a liar if you claim that you're a fan of science fiction, movies, or art, whatever the cause. It's a film event that must be behold by all, told by a master filmmaker, who truly is one of, if not the, greatest filmmaker who ever lived.The film has inspired numerous films, like 'Star Wars', 'Alien', 'Blade Runner', and 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'. Even it's theme of questioning human existence is explicitly delivered in the almost-equally masterful anime franchise 'Neon Genesis Evangelion', which I urge anyone to see if they liked this film. But really, this film is the great-granddaddy of them all. It shows science fiction in a serious light, and eroding any shred of camp value of the '40s and '50s.Forget George Lucas. Step aside, Steven Spielberg. Move over, Ridley Scott and James Cameron. Stanley Kubrick is The Man and you better believe it.People, this film is apothetical.Overall: 10/10",10,2,7,30 November 2008
Elysium," The future's a bloody mess, literally
","Neill Blomkamp's 'Elysium' is far more flawed than his debut 'District 9', yet it is still skillful summer entertainment and a worthy continuation of the thematic backdrop that Blomkamp has set in the latter - futuristic social inequality. This film however takes the quote 'the rich get richer and the poor get poorer' to orbital heights, literally, as the eponymous 2001-esque space colony gets filled to the brim with the wealthy while the rest of the poor folks gets damned on a vastly overpopulated Earth. Here in Los Angeles, a criminal named Max (Damon) struggles to board Elysium after a freak accident, while corruption and paranoia seethes through Elysium official Delacourt (Foster).This social commentary on whether society is doomed by their own doing is used as a clothesline for frenetic sequences of violent action, all combined to form one feature-length race against time for the underdog to triumph over all. Thing is, the underdog has to face an even crazier dog, a disgruntled and psychopathic mercenary named Kruger hired by Delacourt to off Max for, um, doing good stuff. Sharlto Copley, the flawed protagonist in Blomkamp's previous effort, plays a despicable and barbaric villain so well here that he's in danger of being typecast as such, as opposed to Matt Damon who can play an action hero in his sleep. Even when Damon suits up in a clunky brain-controlled exo-skeleton following the accident, we root for him because he's a clear underdog that the audience supports.Blomkamp's screenplay is flawed, with certain gaps of physical logic here and there, and the story seems cobbled from previous superior sci- fi classics. But where his screenplay fails, it's his direction and vision that delivers. Blomkamp successfully materializes two different worlds - rich and poor - in technical aspects, and presents them as a black-and-white prophecy. Gritty scenes in the L.A. slums on Earth are compelling to watch when compared starkly to the spectacular-looking utopia-like Elysium. Any space colony that can rebuild exploded faces is a colony worth living on, no? It must've been a challenge for production designer Philip Ivey to come up with concepts for both sides, but he succeeds.Which brings me to the other factor - the action sequences, and Blomkamp delivers thoroughly on that aspect. Frantic action sequences mixed with crowd-pleasing and squeamish moments made me realize - here is a modern- day filmmaker who knows action, and what his audience wants and keeps on that promise. In my opinion they were far more exhilarating and refreshing to watch than any other movie this summer, as they provide no shortage of old school bloody thrills - and I do mean bloody.'Elysium' may be flawed and familiar story-wise as it should have been half an hour longer with more scenes set in the colony, but it still has a thought-provoking concept and enough action to vastly satisfy both the popcorn crowd and the action crowd. This is a summer blockbuster that delivers.",6,2,3,8 August 2013
Taken," 'I will find you... and I will kill you'.
","With these words, ex-CIA agent Bryan Mills has exactly 96 hours to set out and look for his daughter's kidnappers in Paris before she is lost in the sex/slave trade. That's it. No subplots, no cheap thrills, nothing. Even the film's length shows the simplicity of that purpose. 94 minutes. But...William Friedkin said it best when making the hunted; 'today's action movies are too long (winded) and overblown.' Sure, there are long action movies that are still enjoyable; all 4 'Die Hard's, 'True Lies', 'Speed', 'Face/Off', and then there are some which are dumb fun but somewhat incoherent altogether; the last two 'Pirates of the Caribbean' movies, 'xXx' and most Michael Bay films show this. Not here. It's short, fast and definitely exciting.A realistic knuckle-bound, no-holds-barred thriller, Taken has the ingredients that make a great action movie, added with some 'zing' to make it better. That 'zing' is Liam Neeson. His character, Mills is a flawed person. A lonely man with a dark past. His wife left him for another, seemingly better man, because he could not leave his job. His only daughter seems to be the only thing that shows his true human qualities. But take that life-saving angel of his and he will unleash a hell-storm upon those who took her. No, really. It's all about characterization. Neeson is transformed from concerned parent to angel of death within a flash. He would shoot, punch, kick, snap, kill anyone within his rescue path, and yet, possess some humane qualities that make him believable. It's great, because Neeson shows us that he can be an action hero that everybody can cheer on and be afraid of at the same time. I wonder what would Neeson's career would be now if he had taken that action hero path. Don't get me wrong, Neeson is still an exceptionally brilliant actor, but here he shows he can kick ass, hard, and still be up and out, thirsty for more. Mills give Jason Bourne, The Transporter, and 007 a run for their money.Now the story (by action great Luc Besson and partner Robert Mark Kamen) is simple, but it is refreshingly written well and quite original. It's clear these guys did their research. The first 20 minutes is slow-paced, explaining in detail Neeson's characterization, as well as building up the tension and expectations. However by then the pace will skyrocket, and you will find yourself immersed in this speeding bullet of an actionier. Also it is straightforward and simple, but that's how I (and presumably most action fans) like our action movies nowadays. No confusing plot twists. No cheap thrills. No third person life-savers. And although there are some flaws, it's mostly because they're predictable and clichéd. But that only occurs very few times in the film. It's literally in-your-face action. The dialog is also well written, especially some lines (as exampled by the title comment) said by Neeson himself, in a cold and brutal manner. All I can say is the simple 'child-gets-kidnapped' plot device is slightly reinvented and done with justice here, ala the 'out-for-revenge' plot device used in 'Man on Fire', another excellent action movie.It's clear that almost everyone involved in the technical aspects of the film is French, and seeing that the film is mostly set in Paris, comes to no surprise. The direction by Pierre Morel is very lively and kinetic, increasing the pace as the film progresses until the climax. He shows a knack for directing action sequences - and there are plenty in this movie. Brutal fights, shootouts, car chases and hand-to-hand combat are put to well use here - in fact this may be THE hardest PG-13 action film ever made. Morel is a guy to look out for in the future. The scenery is photographed by fellow cinematographer Michel Abramowicz, who clearly knows his background as we see the lively and glamorous streets of Paris disguising the gritty urban atmosphere of the underworld. It's really neat and fits the mood of the film well. Accompanying these is slick editing by Frédéric Thoraval, and really neat music by Nathaniel Mechaly, whose score can compete with John Powell's score for the 'Bourne' trilogy - fast and kinetic during action scenes, slow and reflective during dramatic scenes. Puts you in the mood. Closing off this expanded review, the supporting actors. Don't have nothing much to say as Neeson alone has your total attention. However some credit goes to Maggie Grace as the daughter, convincing us she's not exactly the typical damsel-in-distress.Overall, 'Taken' is not just solid, it's SUPER solid. It's excellent. Not only one of the best films of the year, it's also one of the best action movies ever made! A joyously refreshing film to watch, especially if you're an action fan, make this a must-see on your list. It's freaking brilliant and will linger in your mind for some time.Entertainment value: 10/10Overall: 9/10",7,7,8,21 December 2008
Invictus," At the age of 79, Eastwood proves he is still a master filmmaker.
","Clint Eastwood is not only my favorite hero, but one of my very favourite movie directors. There is a certain way that he uses to direct his films. It is slow-paced, subtle, but concentrated and focused. He doesn't rely on visual effects and smash-cut editing to get the ball rolling for his movies. He doesn't rely on Parkinson's afflicted cameramen during slow moments. No, he does it the good ol' fashioned way. Conservative he may be, but it's that method that distinguishes his craft from others. It's a very recognizable and refreshing trait after seeing giant robots smash each other from screen to screen.Having said that, Eastwood's latest film 'Invictus' is a masterpiece. Yes, I mean that. Why? Not because it is a simple story that is not always original, but it is a simple story that is executed beautifully. Eastwood's directorial traits are seen here, and it brilliantly shows. Like Don Siegel and Sergio Leone before him, Eastwood manages to bring out the best, sharpest and most humanistic performances out of the actors in the movie. So what if they all spoke in English? The same thing happened in Schindler's List, did anyone complain?Moving on to the performances. I swear I was watching the real Nelson Mandela on the screen instead of Morgan Freeman. It is proved that he did not get chosen for this movie based on his uncanny resemblance to Mandela. Here Freeman IS Mandela, he nails the performance, he owns the movie, he is the driving force of the movie. Freeman shows depth as Mandela, as well as wit, dry charm and a huge humble side to him. It's a performance which is nothing short of phenomenal and is really Freeman's role of his career.Matt Damon is also noteworthy as Pinear, the rugby captain. His South African accent is very convincing, his performance is full of vigor and confidence, and it further solidifies the fact that he is a great actor as well as a great action hero, a fact proved in the 'Jason Bourne' series. Damon says that working with Eastwood makes him want to emulate Eastwood's career I would love to see that.With fine performances (even the supporting actors), the simple story is fleshed out in a solid fashion. It may not be original, but it is VERY inspiring to see the Rugby team giving their all to win. For their country. For peace. Eastwood wrings out the richness in such a simple story but since it is true the screen flows strikingly with the brilliant theme of hope and courage.Not forgetting the jazz-inspired (another Eastwood trait) music and the strikingly beautiful cinematography by Tom Stern, Eastwood, like PIXAR Animation Studios, shows class and versatility as one of Hollywood's most gifted filmmakers and storytellers, and he shows no signs of slowing down or weakening out. This is a must see, for everyone; men, women and even children to see. I give it my highest recommendations.Overall rating: 10/10.",7,1,2,10 March 2010
Super 8," Excellent storytelling. It's the kind of movie Spielberg would make in the 80's.
","I like this movie. I really do, honest. Most of the blockbusters are mostly solid while most of the others are ho-hum. However, J.J. Abrams has performed a summer movie miracle. In the process of creating a homage of Steven Spielberg movies, he has crafted an extremely entertaining film that has a heart as big as its thrills.I won't describe the juiciest bits of the story here, since they'll spoil the public. All I can tell you is that it's about kids making a movie using their Super 8 camera, something mysterious happen, strange things start to happen. Having said that, the screenplay is well written, most notably the dialog by the children which is funny, witty and engaging. I especially admire the children's attention to detail - like finding production value for their movie. The way they make their own little movie is a touching, heartfelt ode to the filmmakers who also started out that way. Makes anyone, young or old, want to make their own movies again if they haven't already.It's an amazing feat when all of the child actors perform especially well in their roles, and actually make you care about them, and bring you into their adventure. I really hope all child actors will get good, promising careers in the future. In addition, it's nice to see Kyle Chandler on the big screen again.Abrams pulled it off here, not only in writing the screenplay but directing the movie as well with care and focus. He has direction that would make Spielberg proud. Of course, with Spielberg himself producing the film it's no surprise that the entire film feels like a genuine Spielberg movie, the kind of adventure movie that he would make before 'Schindler's List' changed him into a bona-fide serious filmmaker (not that that's a bad thing). We've come a long way since adventure films like 'E.T.' and 'The Goonies', but Spielberg and Abrams prove that old school works, and works well. The well-rendered CGI and some spectacular action sequences are actually overshadowed by the mystery, story and characters, proving once again that eye candy is no match for a big heart and good ol' fashioned storytelling.With good cinematography, production design and a John William-esque score by Michael Giacchino, 'Super 8' is the best of the blockbusters, maybe for the summer, maybe for 2011 itself (I still patiently await Spielberg's own 'Tintin'). One thing's for sure, in terms of pure entertainment, this is perfect. It has that rare blockbuster movie magic, and I would not be surprised if 'Super 8' was nominated for Best Picture at next year's Oscars. No, I'm not joking, and I'm certainly not exaggerating.If J.J. Abrams can keep this up, he would be a potential successor to Steven Spielberg. And lastly, stay for the credits.Overall rating: 86/100",6,3,8,10 June 2011
How to Train Your Dragon," I felt something wonderful while watching this movie.
","I don't know. I saw only one trailer of the film before watching it. Maybe it was the low expectations. Well, given Dreamworks' stream of recent animated films ('Shrek', 'Madagascar', but leave out 'Kung Fu Panda' which was genuinely great) one could expect laughs but little substance.I am glad that my low expectations were blown away immensely. Not only is 'How To Train Your Dragon' hilarious, it is also genuinely heartwarming, filled with gorgeous and beautiful animation, and topped off with easy-to-like characters (and dragons, to boot), and a very positive moral core to it.Yes, it has it's fair share of clichés and obtaining a somewhat predictable story, but it's mainly a family film, so they are excused. Yet, with all this in mind, I felt something when watching the movie. I don't know what it was, but it was the same feeling I felt when watching most Pixar films like last year's 'Up' and especially 'WALL-E'. It was a wonderful feeling. I genuinely felt for the characters, they were very easy to like and to relate to. It was to my surprise that I knew almost all of the actors who starred in it but did not recognize them at certain parts. All of the voice actors are great, especially the lead Jay Baruchel. I also absolutely LOVED the main dragon Toothless even though it wasn't a talking animal, with it's realistic and humane emotions and its beautiful design. The animation was also beautifully rendered, and it is truly a sight to behold in 3D, with some scenes comparable to the 'Ikran' scenes from Avatar, if not better. It took me away from the real world and into the film's fantasy world. The film's moral message, that we should not judge things by its cover and thus act rashly towards it, is straightforwardly delivered. And finally John Powell's music score is sweeping and full of emotion in many moments.Therefore, 'How To Train Your Dragon' will definitely get my approval for one of 2010's very best films, if not THE best so far. Let's hope not. However I have the urge to see the movie again as it felt like it was infinitely re-watchable. Parents should take their kids, children should see it with their friends, couples should see it together, everyone should see it. It is one of the best animated films to come out in a long time. And it definitely blows away all of Dreamworks' previous effort.Bravo, Mr. DeBlois and Mr. Sanders. Congratulations for making another animated classic.Overall value: 9/10.",7,2,5,31 March 2010
Limitless," What the screenplay writers needs is one of them pills...
","Time and time again Hollywood has delivered many an exciting mainstream blockbuster with an intriguing premise - this one is no exception. A pill that allows people to access 100% of their brain... who does not want that, the answer to all of life's problems? Or so it seems...Unfortunately, this very ingenious (and admittedly, mostly desirable) premise isn't completely fleshed out due to the middling screenplay. Judging from the talent involved - Bradley Cooper, Robert De Niro and director Neil Burger - the screenplay never really gels together and is sadly about as coherent as a forgettable blockbuster (if there is such a term).Which is a shame, really. Cooper shows high amounts of charm and charisma in his first non-ensemble lead role, and he proves he has the chops to carry a big film by himself. Abbie Cornish has nothing to do apart from being the obligatory love interest, but De Niro never really unleashes his true chops and becomes nothing more than a two-dimensional character. As for the production value - design, music, editing and cinematography - top notch and slick, as usual for a movie of this type. I especially admired the visual effects of the continuous and extended zoom, it seemed like the camera really knows no boundaries.The screenplay, oh why did it cop out? There was so much potential in it - if the pill can exploit 100% of the human brain, we should have seen more effects and consequences of the pill - more philosophical thinking, and how would this affect his new life - but no. All we got is a story of greed and addiction - nice job taking a jab at all those medicinal addictions, but the screenplay seriously needed more work. And where did those pesky Russian thugs come from?In short, it's quite disappointing. Somewhere in this okay movie is a great movie screaming to come out. But then, for all its slick and glossy finish, it's too two-dimensional to be intelligent, but it's definitely a little food for thought.Overall value: 64/100",6,5,7,14 April 2011
Thor," Kenneth Branagh adds heavy dramatic depth to an already quite-unusual superhero flick
","Alright, back when this was into preproduction, I (and so many comic book fans) were surprised when Branagh was slated to direct. Here we have Thor the god of lightning and his mighty hammer, directed by a man who works mostly around William Shakespeare plays.Thankfully, this helps. A lot.Almost every superhero movie (Marvel, lately) focuses on more action instead of character development. Sure, they may look awesome, but you get used to it. Branagh bravely steers away from this predicament and directs the actors with such skill and flair you may mistake this film for yet another Branagh/Shakespeare costume epic.Make no mistake this is still a superhero film, with some nice special effects and a stylish production design for Asgard, but there's a nice human twist to the story - that of dueling brothers, or gods, or god- brothers... you get the idea. Chris Hemsworth looks just about right for the part and shows some charisma as well as the hero. Branagh has assembled an interesting mix of actors - we have the great Anthony Hopkins, the cute Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgard, Kat Dennings, Idris Elba and even Rene Russo. Tom Hiddleston however steals the scene as the mischievous brother Loki.Here's another good thing about the movie - the story and acting outweigh the special effects and action sequences. For a superhero film, this is extremely rare. Branagh deserves kudos for the effort, however some parts do not gel in nicely and there's some action bits that are not too well-filmed.All is forgiven though - 'Thor' is an above-average superhero movie, not extremely exciting, but definitely intriguing. Fans of both comic book films and costume dramas will certainly enjoy this.Two words of caution - one, keep an eye out for some cameos, both during and after the film. Two, for goodness sake do not watch it in 3D. I saw it in normal 2D and that's fine enough by me. I didn't see anything worth watching in 3D in it.Overall rating: 68/100",6,12,19,6 May 2011
Die Hard," Action. Adventure. Willis. What More Could You Ask For?
","All NYPD cop John McClane wanted to do is to celebrate Chtistmas with his wife in a newly-opened 40 storey building in Los Angeles. But a group of 12 terrorists have other plans.Die Hard opened in 1988 with explosive results. Until today, it is one of the finest examples of how an action movie should be made. It has everything you want in an action movie: cool heroes, bad guys getting it, explosions, stunts, and more. This is a recipe for an action masterpiece.Bruce Willis portrays McClane, who (is now and later significantly for the three sequels) is at the wrong place at the wrong time. He plays a hero unlike those other 80's action types like the indestructible Schwarzenegger and the one-man-army Stallone. And definitely not like the stereotypic Van Damme and Seagal. Willis is in a class of his own, emitting one liners to make the audience chuckle and sympathize for his character, which is a rare thing in action movies nowadays. He is the perfect definition of a REAL human hero, one that someone else could relate to.Alan Rickman plays terrorist leader Hans Gruber. He is the example of a cruel but wise mastermind who systematically plan out his sequence of events. He will do anything to succeed his goal, but always get foiled by McClane. Rickman portrays Gruber so masterfully that I put Hans Gruber in my Top 5 greatest villains ever.The cinematography and editing is also great. Jan De Bont does a great job of scoping out the Fox Plaza for the Nakatomi Tower. The interior sets of the tower looks confined, thus giving the film a claustrophobic sense. This explanation can be further exampled when McClane crawls inside a ventilation shaft. Also, the quick cuts make the action scenes feel fast-paced, giving all the action scenes glory in delivering its effect. Production designer Jackson DeGovia should be given Kudos for making the interior sets as realistic as possible.Action sequences are also properly handled. Director John McTiernan, who helmed the gung-ho Schwarzenegger action fest Predator a year before, returns to up the ante on this cinematic treat. He gives the action scenes realism, like during the rooftop helicopter scene. It is one of those things that you cannot argue whether it is absurd or not. That is what I like about it. The writing is also good, too. Screenwriters Jeb Stuart and Steven E. De Souza adapted the Roderick Thorp novel 'Nothing Lasts Forever' and gives us a screenplay full of thrills. The tension is also well written and filmed, both the situation in the building where McClane is having trouble, and also on the ground where the police are confused, as in both situations you do not know what happens next.Finally, let's give an 'Ode To Joy' for the late great composer Michael Kamen, who gives a suitable orchestral score for the movie that suits it very, very well indeed, instead of giving us those annoying electronic 80's score.Overall, Die Hard deserves a place on any 'Top Action Films' list. An instant masterpiece that is well appreciated then and now, it will survive the test of time and will forever thrill audiences for many, many years to come.9.96/10 Delton",9,2,4,13 October 2007
Zero Dark Thirty," Thriller tartare
","The hunt for Osama bin Laden was an excruciating one, especially by American government agencies. Countless people, both at home and abroad, lost their lives and time fighting and searching for the man, and in a small town in Pakistan, 2011, the search came to a blistering end.Kathryn Bigelow's docudrama 'Zero Dark Thirty' recreates the tense events leading up to that day. Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal sidesteps the drama and goes straight for the jugular, a controversial decision given the attention by the masses towards the plot material.I am not here to divulge into political issues that may or may not have been brought up in the film. I am merely judging the film in terms of its craftsmanship as a thriller. And to that, I say, Bigelow has crafted a superb thriller; raw in suspense and crackling with tension and paranoia, not unlike 'The Hurt Locker'.This is not an action movie although there are good scenes which suggest it. Bigelow sheds the genre conventions down to basics to show the journey without any delay. The film is, stripped-to-the-bone, a thriller set on a slow burn, opening with brutal torture scenes, followed by investigative/procedural dramatics for the first half. In the second half, Bigelow purposely left the stove running to a boil, culminating in a surprisingly nail-biting climax.Characters come and go as the plot requires it, but Jessica Chastain's character remains the core of this movie, as she determinedly buries herself in her job to capture the most notorious man on Earth. At the end of it all, you might be putting yourself in her shoes: is it all worth it?",7,0,6,13 January 2013
12 Years a Slave," Roll Jordan Roll
","A random and encounter has led Solomon Northup from living freely in New York to being kidnapped and sold into slavery in Louisiana, getting handed over to various slave owners. There, Solomon witnesses numerous acts of cruelty that no man should ever face.As I stared at the movie screen with full dread, I was reeling back at certain scenes I had just witnessed. There were good films and television shows about slavery before, and they had various nuances at how to tackle slavery. This film is part of said resurgence of the sub- genre, hot on the heels of 'Django Unchained' and 'The Butler'. But while the former relinquishes on Spaghetti Western entertainment more than attempting to address the issue in a political light as the latter, Steve McQueen's '12 Years a Slave' shuts those two up, and perhaps the entire sub-genre, for good. I doubt any future slavery-themed film will be as harrowing as this one was.Steve McQueen is a fearless filmmaker, continuing his streak of unfiltered brutality within human depths. He frames his actors' faces in extreme close-up, the eyes staring into despair, the nostrils fuming in aggression. Naked flesh are shown not because of erotic content, but rather because of desperation and futility. Long takes and wide shots are not uncommon in his films, and here they showcase a plethora of fantastic scenes and performances that work to discomfort the viewer as much as possible. McQueen doesn't just allow the audience to tackle slavery, he guts the audience and leaves them for the consequences. This is an extremely uncomfortable film to watch. Beautifully shot locations are placeholders for unsettling sequences before and after, contemplated by Hans Zimmer's poignant and at times horrifying score. This all works to create a nightmarish time and place where hell walks on Earth.Central to all of this is the performance of Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon. Ejiofor showcases that he is a natural force to be reckoned with in this film, after a decade of mostly supporting characters. He spaces out in despair as the camera lingers onto him for solid minutes, not a word spoken. Another sequence shows him mourning the death of a fellow worker, in which the singing of the surrounding group compels him and shakes him down to tears. These scenes follow earlier ones where he is a classy, free man in the upper states, mingling happily with the crowd and partaking in fanciful music sessions. It is a tour-de-force performance.A fine ensemble of established and up-and-coming actors surround Ejiofor in his limelight - Paul Dano, Paul Giammati, Alfre Woodard, Sarah Paulson, even Brad Pitt and Benedict Cumberbatch, but none so ferociously as McQueen regular Michael Fassbender as the despicable, sadistic plantation owner Edwin Epps. So excellent and terrifying is Fassbender's portrayal of such a merciless and barbaric person, that the mere sight of him will either cause audience members unfamiliar to him to flinch.I was left speechless as the credits rolled. A lesser film would have added tacked-on sentimentality/exaggeration and politically influenced claptrap. Not this one. This is a movie to watch as a reminder of how powerful the human spirit can endeavor, and how lucky all of us have grown past that dreadful time in history. The full effect of it has not been felt in movies before, until now.",9,185,279,18 October 2013
Man on Fire," Brutal and brilliant.
","Denzel Washington (Training Day (2001), John Q. (2002)) sizzles up the silver screen in this drama action/thriller. He and starlet Dakota Fanning (I am Sam (2001), Taken (SERIES 2002)) have ways of connecting us even further into the movie. We learn about Creasy's (Washington) new job and his relationship with the people around him that makes him change in the first hour.Then, during the second hour, director Tony Scott shows us his trademark action genre as Creasy ignites his anger after Pita's (Fanning) kidnapping. Now with the help of a reporter (Rachel Ticotin) and a detective (Giancarlo Giannini), Creasy vows to hunt down the mastermind behind the kidnapping, that is 'The Voice'.As we go deeper, we feel a sense of pity for Creasy. With Harry Gregson-Williams' (Phone Booth (2002)) gritty and touching score, we can feel that the villains should deserve to die.Overall, Man on Fire is a solid movie, not for its action, but for its drama. Hats off to you, Scott!146 minutes.8.9/10 stars.",9,6,8,10 December 2004
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," 'If he's crazy, then what makes us?'
","Rarely has there been a film with such a raw and unnerving atmosphere than ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST. This film is one which truly deserves the Big Five Oscars , including Best Picture of 1975. I picked it up just to see how good it is, and in a positive fashion, got more than I bargained for.Based on Ken Kesey's lauded novel, Randle McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) is a small time crook who thinks he can get out of work in prison by pretending to be crazy. However he is sent to a mental institution, where the head nurse is more of a dictator than a regular one, and is behind him every step of the way.What I like most about the film is the chemistry between the actors. And Jack Nicholson clearly shows off his talent here. His portrayal of McMurphy is close to perfection, as his character displays more moral values than most of our politicians in real life. From his inspirational talk to Chief, to heated 'meetings' with the nurse, Nicholson becomes an acting tour-de-force to be reckoned with, and his Best Actor win for this film solidifies my point. Without him, the movie may be a failure.Another crucial point of the film is the main antagonist, Nurse Ratched, played chillingly to the bone by veteran Louise Fletcher. Sure, this small-size female may be soft-toned, but beware, she has the leer of a king cobra and will spurt out personal questions relentlessly towards weak-minded people to get her dictatorial ways. The fact that she is evil is how cold and insensitive she is towards her patients, especially during therapy sessions. Fletcher also deserves her Oscar.The supporting characters don't have much to say here - we see a pre-BACK-TO-THE-FUTURE Christopher Lloyd (Doc Emmett Brown) in a scene-stealing role as an aggressive mental patient, Danny DeVito as an annoying OCD-like dimwit, and Brad Dourif in a mesmerizing and more sensitive role than his later effort, the killing doll Chucky in CHILD'S PLAY. Will Sampson, however, plays his character Chief with conviction. For a tall and mean-looking giant, he practically has some moral values of his own, yet he doesn't disclose them. However, the whole movie is about McMurphy's feud with Ratched and how it affects everyone around them.The direction is solid, if not slow paced. Best Director winner Milos Forman directs with passion in mind. His direction is crisp and full of sublimity, which gives the film a sort of distinct beauty to it. The dialogue scenes are gripping, and characterization is fully realized with this. The cinematography as well is great, the mental hospital looks grim and eerie and boring at the same time. The music is well-handled, as most of the music appears during the therapy scenes. And of course, the great screenplay by Laurence Hauben and Bo Goldman, who seems to have taken every important aspect from the novel and turned it into cinematic greatness.All-in-all, I have nothing but profound respect for this film. It's truly a real film experience, some of which you do not get today. As a film, it stand the test of time and will remain a classic for many, many others to see. I highly recommend this piece of art, but mind you, it's only for people with patience to see slow movies, so that they can indulge on the greatness much later. For now, enjoy this film.9.9997/10Delton",9,0,2,21 August 2008
The Wolf of Wall Street," Cash, debauchery and the pursuit of narcissism
","A third into the film, Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) walks and talks to the camera as it tracks along the Stratton Oakmont office floor showing the exaggerated and frantic goings-on in just another day's work. Belfort tells to the audience that the office is about to release an initial public offering stock (IPOs) and proceeds to smugly lecture them about the term, but halfway through he cynically asks that we probably 'didn't understand what he said', smiles, and disappears within the rabid office crowd.It's this stone-cold cynicism that defines Martin Scorsese's 'The Wolf of Wall Street', and it permeates throughout nearly the whole movie up until the final 15 minutes. We watch and wince in parts awestruck, in shock and in double takes (sometimes all three at once) as we witness the rise and fall of Belfort as he confidently narrates and provides commentary on the current situation being shown. Like two of Martin Scorsese's more popular films, 'GoodFellas' and 'Casino', 'Wolf' relies on a cynical narrator who comments dryly on interesting situations. Like both movies, it has the protagonist working his way to the top for the first half of the movie - 'Wolf' chronicles his beginnings by being advised by his boss (a brief but hilarious Matthew McConaughey) on his first day of work on the benefits of drugs and sex on the job; selling penny stocks for thousands after said job didn't turn out well; opening a firm with his ragtag pals and new partner Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill); and dumping his caring first wife (Cristin Miloti) and goes after a gorgeous fashionista (Margot Robbie). Once Belfort hits the top with the release of an IPO, in typical Scorsese fashion, it all goes downhill from there. The feds start paying attention, with one no-nonsense agent (Kyle Chandler) hot on his tail. Cracks are shown in the organization, especially Belfort and Azoff. Suddenly the hedonism inconspicuously transforms into the critical, and the actions of Belfort and his crew are then placed upon the judgment of the Feds and us, the audience.All of these sequences are directed, written, shot and edited with a hedonistic glee and critical eye, never bucking down to genre conventions and techniques, always on the move. Scorsese hasn't been this lively since 'Casino' and it shows with the terrific and brisk direction, extreme content and perfectly-timed and well-chosen music to go along with the madness that is Stratton Oakfort. To be able to contain such an impressive cast without them outweighing the real center of the film - DiCaprio - as well as juggling acts of debauchery with a critical eye on the desires of human beings - that is the feat of a great filmmaker. To be able to do so with such gusto and energy with a boldness not seen since the '70s, that is a remarkable part on Scorsese to not buck under the political correctness of today. If it happened like that, then it happened like that, why the need to neuter? This is not just on the part of Scorsese, but the very well-written screenplay by Terence Winter which crackles with whip-smart and sharp dialogue throughout; and Rodrigo Prieto's camera-work which bursts out a wide array of colors in every scene, going against the current norm of bleached, gritty looks in films and concerns itself for making the film look as vivid and lurid as Belfort's mind.'Wolf' doesn't slow down the moment the film starts. What follows for a whopping three hours are one cynical and narcissistic act of debauchery after another. Not that the film uses its suggestive content (sexuality, nudity, drug use and language combined border on the hard R side) to wildly bombard the audience with excess, but a key role in ensuring the film is never boring is the editing by Scorsese's editing muse, the great Thelma Schoonmaker, who paces these acts so accordingly they seem like circus troupes of insanity lining up one after another for a performance.The center of the whole film, not just the editing, nor the writing, nor even the direction or the amazing ensemble supporting cast (which includes Rob Reiner, Jon Favreau, Jon Bernthal and Jean Dujardin among others already mentioned), but the absolutely brilliant performance of DiCaprio as Belfort. Like Scorsese here, DiCaprio goes completely for broke in this performance, playing a despicable man so self-obsessed that both his best friend and worst enemy is himself. DiCaprio makes it a miracle to actually make us laugh at this character with his insane Nicolas-Cage-like performance (there is a 15-minute sequence involving DiCaprio and Hill, both coked out and arguing, that had the entire audience rolling with laughter throughout). He drinks, he parties hard, he snorts cocaine, he has wild sex, he gets a drug-induced trip, even in one scene he gets a candle put in an, err, interesting place. And the next day he's off to work in a suit after a snort of cocaine, as if nothing happened the previous day.Like all great actor-director collaborations, they always work off each other's strengths to create something exceptional, and DiCaprio's and Scorsese's tandems bounce off each other perfectly, creating exceptional entertainment and an in-your-face look at how depraved the human obsession can really get. This is the kind of lifestyle that the brilliant documentary 'Inside Man' told us about, but were afraid to show us. Now I know how it feels like, and although it is hilarious, it is also very, very startling.",8,1,5,24 December 2013
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Is it better than 2? Yes. Is it better than the first? No. Is it entertaining? An extreme YES!!!
","New York gets rocked by bombs, and the terrorist has the city as his new playground. And who has to go through his playground? Our hero, Det. John McClane who, again, is the wrong man at the wrong place at the wrong time. Although with help from a morally racist electrician played by none other than the Maestro of Cool, Samuel L. Jackson!! Bruce Willis is as energetic and lively here, as in the previous two, and th chemistry between him and Jackson is superb. I also like to point out Jeremy Irons' almost show-stealing villainous performance as Simon, who plays a twisted game of Simon Says with McClane and company.The storyline by Jonathan Hensliegh is fresh and quite original, something of a rarity in sequels. Although yes, I do agree there is a HUGE plot hole somewhere in the middle, but come on! It by no means aims to win an Oscar, but it still has depth and heart, and cool, slick action scenes, that makes it a Die Hard film. Also, it's nice to see McTiernan directing again, injecting what he gained from the first film into here, thus giving it a 'Die Hard' feel even more.Overall, I think this is a major improvement over the second, and its definitely one of the better action sequels out there. Worth your money and time.8.12/10Delton",8,4,6,9 January 2008
Inception," Sci-fi perfection. A truly mesmerizing film.
","I'm nearly at a loss for words. Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldn't follow up to 'The Dark Knight', he does it again, delivering another masterpiece, one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years. Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird, but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just can't help watching and wondering what will happen next. That is a real powerful skill a director has. No wonder Warner Bros. put their trust in him, he is THAT good of a director, and over-hyping a Christopher Nolan film, no matter what the film is about, is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films before.Not since the eras of Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan. He is, undoubtedly, one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history. Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime. He has the ability to seduce our eyes, ears and most importantly, mind, and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast. Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time. And yes, it is similar to the excellent anime film 'Paprika' in the whole 'invading dreams' plot, but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different level.Visuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time, it's either all-visuals-no-smarts ('G.I. Joe', 'Transformers') or the exact opposite ('Doubt', 'Invictus'). In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jaw-dropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believability.Although having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio (Warner Bros), this film is a very personal film for Nolan, he wrote the film as well as directing it, and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolan's perplexing, increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up. Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film. This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher, rather it is a film for thinkers. Honestly I can't explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers. Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience. The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed, confused and ultimately breathless. It's like a puzzle, both physically and mentally, and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues. However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the film's humanity, and this is where 'Inception' shines. It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come. That's right, years.Once the film ends, you'll want to watch it again, for there's something new every time. This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the film's ambiguous themes, and will be discussed by many in the future. This is an original film, no adaptation, no sequel/prequel, no remake/reboot, which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows ('Avatar' be damned).Of course, a film is not complete without the actors. Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance, similar but better than his previous effort 'Shutter Island'. He shows glimpses of a flawed, grim, fragile man, who has knowledge about everything else but yet can't seem to come in grips with himself and his demons. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Michael Caine, Marion Cottilard, Pete Postlethwaite, Lukas Haas... Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their own.Nolan is of course, a master behind the camera, a real virtuoso when it comes to film. His direction is taut, focused, gripping, and extraordinarily fascinating. The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan, considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into pop-culture art two years ago ('The Dark Knight'). The action sequences are unique, exciting and fresh, something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds. The visual effects are awesome and imaginative, and best of all they do not bring down the movie's quality one bit, rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch. The cinematography is absolutely, beautifully shot, so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory. Production design is top notch, with terrific design of sets and locations. Hans Zimmer's complementing music score is simply outstanding, and knowing the man, that's really all I have to say. Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this year.Christopher Nolan has once again outdone himself. He truly is a gifted filmmaker, arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today. And 'Inception' can proudly stand alongside 'Blade Runner' and '2001: A Space Odyssey' as science-fiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogether.There are two types of films: the crowd-pleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indie/art film. Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package, pulling off that rare, now nearly-extinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots. Movie of Summer 2010? Movie of 2010? Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade! Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent people.Missing this film and not getting the film's point is a crime.Overall value: 9/10 (Excellent)",8,898,1473,15 July 2010
WALL·E," Could very well be a contender for The Top 10 Films of the Decade.
","Truth be told, I left the cinema speechless. Pixar has truly done it again. How, I ask you, HOW, can a simple yet absurd tale of a robot that falls in love be fantastic? Which brings me to the liberty of writing this review about how this became humanely possible, and is pulled off brilliantly.What if mankind had to leave Earth, and somebody forgot to turn the last robot off? After hundreds of lonely years of doing what he was built for, WALL·E (short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) discovers a new purpose in life (besides collecting knick-knacks) when he meets a sleek search robot named EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator). EVE comes to realize that WALL·E has inadvertently stumbled upon the key to the planet's future, and races back to space to report her findings to the humans (who have been eagerly awaiting word that it is safe to return home). Meanwhile, WALL·E chases EVE across the galaxy and sets an adventure into motion.If there is something to love about the film, it is the main characters WALL·E and EVE. The two are astonishingly lovable, adorable, and without a doubt appealing. The chemistry between them is just gorgeous, and will make you believe that robots can actually fall in love. Without hesitation, dating couples should see this film for this reason alone. No really, I mean it. The two characters are personified and makes them more human than any of us could believe.What works for the two protagonists is that there is little, if none, traces of dialogue between them, so they communicate via means of body language, and it is executed perfectly. Because of this trait, we are able to understand their profound feelings towards each other, making them two of the most genuine and everlasting characters you'll ever see in media history. There are also some other robots to watch, and a cameo appearance by Sigourney Weaver (of 'Alien') as the Axiom's computer.The animation is fluid, clear, and beautiful. From the wastelands of (possible) future Earth, to the vast infinite borders of space to the bright and lively display of the Axiom, the drawings are unbelievably beautiful and realistic. The Pixar team and director Andrew Stanton really gave their all and determination to brush their vision across the big screen. All I can say is, their hard effort paid off in more than full.The moral message is also clear - 700 years in the future we have polluted Earth to such an extent we have to live in outer space, the final frontier. As a result of relying too heavily on machinery, human evolution has resulted in the decrease of bone mass, making them obese and literally couch potatoes. This is a nice and not too harrowing reminder of the possibilities and consequences of polluting the Earth and relying heavily on machines too much.With its lovable characters, beautiful art, and majestic scale, I crown WALL·E the king of animated features thus far, as well as one of the best romantic tales of the era. Seriously. Do yourselves a favor and watch this piece of art. It's one not to be missed by men, women, children (and robots) alike.9.9996/10Delton",8,2,5,22 August 2008
Despicable Me," Very cute and adorable animated film.
","As a reviewer mentioned, this year is set to be a great year of animated films, much like the previous two years. This is proved with Pixar's unmatched (touching wood) winning streak and Dreamworks' surprise turn 'How To Train Your Dragon', which proceeds to continue the ever- increasing 'golden years' of computer-animated films. Universal's 'Despicable Me' is yet another gem in an already quite-heavy bag of diamonds.With nice direction, the filmmakers were able to combine two quite unoriginal plots into one with ease and without force, and they managed to add wit, charm and smart humor to it as well. Not to mention heart. I have never heard of the filmmakers before, but this is a heck of a debut from two first-time animated film directors. The humor is also not too over the top, yet utterly hilarious and ingenious when they pop up. Most of the jokes had the entire audience rolling in the aisles. The three girls end up being adorable and lovable characters, as per the main character/protagonist/villain, whom you can't help but cheer on and care for, no matter what he does. Steve Carell is spot-on as Gru and he makes the role funnier than it should be, I mean his voice and humorous style is there behind the funny accent. And what Gru plots and does is beyond ridiculous and far too funny to be deemed 'serious' by any cynic. Some hilarious supporting characters round out the primary cast, most notably Gru's assistant Dr. Nefarious played by Russell Brand, and I could not believe Julie Andrews was Gru's mother, I hardly recognized her voice at all! Jason Segel was hilarious as Gru's vain nemesis Vector. And let's not forget the utterly adorable and hilarious minions and their wacky antics.Technical wise, the animation is gorgeous, bright and nicely rendered with a deft touch of simplicity to it, causing it to be not too overly glossy and polished. This makes the animation look less artificial and more fluid, and this especially shows when it comes to the practical jokes. The music score is just wonderful and suits the moods of the film as they come along. The 3D is great and used quite a number of times in the movie during many effect-driven scenes, which is very impressive considering the poor up-conversion to 3D of MANY movies of late.Overall, this animated film is a great fun time for the kids and family to see, and even some teens will get many laughs out of it as well. This is a very adorable film, full of charm and heart, and with a funny and lighthearted storyline, and may the powers that be reward this at the box office, if the mediocre 'Eclipse' isn't taking all of its viewers already. Looks like Universal's animation days are returning.Entertainment value: 10/10Overall: 7.5/10",6,50,76,9 July 2010
Raging Bull," Masterpiece. De Niro is an acting God....simply magnificent.
","Robert De Niro is probably one of the greatest actors ever. In this movie, he solidifies that statement, with gritty realism. Based on Ex-Middlewieght Champion Jake la Motta's life, the film chronicles the rise and fall of his boxing career, as well as his ups and downs in personal life. De Niro has given us one of the most powerful performances ever. He deserved the Oscar he won in 1981. De Niro is also a hard worker. I mean, he would put on weight and wear a fat suit to keep his character real!! An excellent example of acting is when La Motta accuses his brother and manager for sleeping with his wife. The dialog is fantastic, and the energy provided by De Niro is dynamic.I understand that De Niro was helping director Martin Scorcese with drug problems during production. That's called determination. He worked so hard on the film that eventually he got rid of his drug problem. Sure, this has Scorcese-style over it, but not like Taxi Driver (another classic). This movie has a completely different feel over it, it's not feel-good and inspirational like Rocky, but rather, a realistic and tragic downfall that leaves us speechless. The fights scenes are also well filmed and edited.Scorsese shot the film in black and white, beautifully portraying a certain era of misery and depression. The music is also good, whenever I hear the theme from Raging Bull, I get watery-eyed.But of course, De Niro is not the only one whose good in acting. Cathy Moriarty gives a great performance as the abused and misunderstood wife, and Joe Pesci is just superb as La Motta's brother, Joey. Nevertheless, it is De Niro who still makes it to the top.Overall, the film is a fine and iconic example of film-making art and will get better as time passes. It will stand the test of time and will still remain triumphant. Simply put, a excellent movie which will never be forgotten.9.91/10 Delton.",9,2,4,12 October 2007
The Dark Knight Rises," The hero Gotham deserves...
","Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight Rises' is a mainstream accomplishment, a skillfully crafted, ambitious superhero movie that adds more dimension to the superhero genre. Here is the epic (2 and 3/4 hours!) conclusion to a most beloved trilogy that forever changed the genre that it was type-casted in.I really have to admire Christian Bale's dedication to the role. At times he is weak, lacking confidence, and shrouded in gloom. At other times (in later scenes involving a prison) his eyes show the painful return to his self-determination and perseverance. Yes his Batman no doubt is still the best interpretation of the character, but here he is more human, less growly and more prone to weakness than ever before. Here, we first see Bruce Wayne as a single, rich hermit with a limp in one leg, aided only by his loyal butler Alfred (Michael Caine in his most emotional performance of the trilogy). Caine may get a supporting actor nomination for this movie.It's been eight years since he took the rep for Harvey Dent's crimes - but Wayne/Batman soon faces a new threat - the towering, ominous terrorist Bane (Tom Hardy in a remarkably gripping performance and an empowering presence) who threatens to destroy Gotham city. Hardy is ruthlessly terrific as Bane, true to the spirit of the comics, as he manages to instill fear in all of Gotham. It would be unfair to compare him to Heath Ledger's pitch perfect portrayal of the Joker, but these are two completely different characters. Whereas the Joker aims for a battle of psychological wits between Batman, Bane aspires just to destroy Bruce Wayne and Gotham.There is a pervasive sense of haunting dread and gloom throughout the movie, especially throughout the first 2 hours and scenes with Bane, this is achieved not just by Nolan's writing/directing but also to cinematographer Wally Pfister who shoots the film in a gloomy hue throughout, and composer Hans Zimmer's great, dark orchestral score. Zimmer probably has outdone himself in the trilogy so far, especially with Bane's ominous one-chord theme.But the last 30 minutes contains nothing but great, sometimes spectacular action sequences and stunts which segues in with the story (a rarity) and which all leads to an emotionally satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. The stunts are so well done, they clearly show they were all done using practical effects instead of CGI (with the probable exception of the stadium scene and scenes involving 'the Bat' and the 'Bat-cycle'... which still look great). Lee Smith's crisp editing and Pfister's cinematography cuts the action at a perfect clip while making the somber moments absorbing.Two love interests are introduced - Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway, looking mesmerizingly beautiful while giving a devilishly cunning performance), a specialized thief/con-woman who is not what she seems, and Miranda Tate (Marion Cottilard) who provides a more gentler shade for the lonely, love-lorn Bruce to rely on, or does he? Young cop John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) serves as a somewhat younger shadow of Bruce, and he also shows the same selfless courage at the climax of the movie where he tries to save some kids from an orphanage. Scenes involving Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) are not particularly notable, but at the very least every one of these characters are still very active in the film's climax.Its the screen writing which suffers slightly. While clearly ambitious and detailed, the screenplay lacks some depth from which the previous film succeeded, and seems to return to the roots of 'Batman Begins', focusing more on comic book origins - combining with the sombre, ultra- realistic tone of 'The Dark Knight'. For the most part, it gels nicely. There's also some nice character development for Bruce and Alfred, where they're relationship gets strained to the fullest. Some twists at the end that would arouse comic-book fans too. However, Bane's full character should have been expanded upon - yes, even though the film is nearly 3 hours long, it's not really long enough. Bane's and Selina's characters lack in development and they come across as near-two dimensional. It's clear Nolan bit off a bit more than he can chew here, since he was trying his best to outdo his previous effort. No faulting the actors though.For all of its screen writing flaws though, 'The Dark Knight Rises' is a mainstream triumph, putting new levels of fear and dread in a superhero movie not seen before its own predecessor. Nolan's vision for the character shines through completely and makes this trilogy rightfully stand out as 'The Godfather' of superhero films. This entry may not be as brilliant as its predecessor, but it is still nevertheless great, sort of excellent really, and hats off to Nolan, Bale, Hardy and the rest of the cast and crew, past and present, for delivering the truest interpretation of the Batman character that has never been, and very likely in the future, never will be seen again. Kudos to you, Christopher Nolan.Overall rating: 86%P.S.: My review for 'The Dark Knight' (2008) four years ago is basically a teenage me kissing the behind of the film, with me calling it a masterpiece and editing the review on IMDb so much until they won't allow me to edit/review it anymore. Looking back, I probably shouldn't have been so enthusiastic and made myself look like a rabid fanboy; it isn't a masterpiece, but nonetheless still an excellent film and the pinnacle of the superhero film genre.EDIT: My sincere condolences to the victims and their family and friends of the Aurora shooting tragedy. This was a real random, cruel and senseless act of violence.",7,29,59,19 July 2012
Iron Man," Believe the hype..., 'Iron Man' is an excellent start to the summer.
","With this film, Marvel's little known comic book superhero is immortalized. The film is big, spectacular, fun, grandiose... in every sense.Robert Downey Jr is terrific as Stark as he shows charm, wit, brains and brawn. His lines are spot on and he brings seems to make Stark into his own, as they have similar traits, making him blend well into his character and making it likable. Jeff Bridges does a convincing Job as the villain. Terrence Howard is okay as Stark's Air Defense pal, and it's nice to see Gwyneth Paltrow in a major film after a long absence, she is simply adorable in this film.The special effects are nicely handled and realistic, and it shows the film's $150 million budget. To quote a fellow reviewer, it's nice to see the use of CGI to the fullest and utmost extent, especially the construction of the suit. The action sequences are handled nicely thus provide excellent eye candy, making them exhilarating. Kudos to director Jon Favreau for really keeping his promise.Great lines, great actors, excellent action scenes and special effects, this movie has the ingredients of a popcorn masterpiece. See it with a bunch of friends, who knows, I'll maybe see it again. This is an excellent way to start the summer, and also the best superhero film since 2005's 'Batman Begins', and that's saying something.Entertainment value: 10/10Overall value: 8.9/10Delton",8,6,13,1 May 2008
Toy Story 3," As expected of Pixar; not only an excellent animated film, but also one of the greatest sequels ever.
","After many successive years with critical acclaim ('Ratatouille', 'WALL- E', 'Up'), animation powerhouse Pixar returns to its roots - good ol' family entertainment, after an eleven-year gap since the last 'Toy Story' film. Being a kid when the first one came out I absolutely adored it and enjoyed the second one as well. Between then and now I grew up and watching the two original movies again I started paying attention to the themes and messages that the films were trying to convey, and both films were rich with them, as well as heart. Now, fresh from the cinema, I have seen the third film.'Toy Story 3', is, as expected from Pixar, not only an excellent film AND the best animated film of the year, but also one of the best sequels ever made. Seriously.Why? Well, apart from the great characterization and chemistry between the characters, terrific voice acting, stunning animation and eye- popping visual effects; this film has a big, beating heart, and strong believability to go along with it.I watched the first two films. I watched these two repeatedly as the years pass. I not only liked the characters, I related to them. I felt joy, pain and sadness towards them. Knowing that this film is the last film in the 'Toy Story' franchise made me curious and even sadder. But just because it's the second sequel in the franchise doesn't mean it won't measure up to the first. This film did measure up to the first, mainly in the emotional range. It's hard not to shed a tear when the powerful and emotionally wrenching third act pops up; you know that we've grown up, it's time to move on and say goodbye to our beloved toys that we've all come to love; once and for all. That's not to say that the film is entirely solemn. The film is almost crammed with hilarious jokes in many parts of the film (Spanish Buzz was hilarious and had the entire audience howling with laughter). The screenplay is fantastically written, weaving together the hilarious moments and tender heartwarming moments, while not leaving out the emotional intensity of the film. This is where the film's magic works it's charm on the audience.Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, John Ratzenberger, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn and Estelle Harris reprise their roles with ease and believability with Blake Clark doing a good job standing in for the late Jim Varney as Slinky. The new-coming actors to the franchise are also good, with veterans like Ned Beatty, Michael Keaton, Bonnie Hunt, Whoopi Goldberg and (surprise) ex-007 Timothy Dalton providing voices to some very interesting supporting characters. Randy Newman's score is, as usual, lively and upbeat as ever, and Lee Unkrich (standing in for original director John Lasseter), directs the film with a touch of class and charm.Pixar shows no signs of slowing down and this film certainly continues this winning streak of theirs. If you are a fan, a father, a kid at heart, or just anybody, really; see this film. It will make you laugh, and it may make you cry. But most important of all, it will make you feel like a kid again while reminding you that; it's time to go on.Despite very few flaws including the sad removal of certain characters that will tick off some fans, 'Toy Story 3' is ultimately an emotional and ultimately more-than-satisfying conclusion to one of the greatest film trilogies of all time. Woody, Buzz and other characters, thank you for all the laughter and lessons you have taught me and other kids back in the years. Goodbye, and enjoy your places as some of the greatest animated characters ever.Overall rating: 9/10 (Excellent)",8,1,2,17 June 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Time for the main event, Mr. Potter.
","'Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows: Part II' continues directly where Part I leaves off. Part I, standing alone, may easily be the best film in the Potter franchise, because of its faithfulness to the novel and for bringing in superb characterization between the three main characters.Alas, Part II suffers slightly from lack of back-story from other characters and somewhat rushed action sequences (which really do look intense, to give it credit). But since this is a direct continuation of the story and not a sequel, I guess it can be excused.Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad film. Far from it. It has a good screenplay, witty dialogue, a dark atmosphere throughout, tense direction by David Yates, and good performances from the actors. There's nothing wrong with that at all.Having said that, there's not much to be said about the movie that is different from the first part, apart from Maggie Smith, Ciaran Hinds and Gary Oldman popping up to complete the cast, some sweeping cinematography and some (not all, some were obviously made for blatant 3D) good visual effects make it quite the exhilarating watch.There's some things which I didn't like. Recurring characters showing up and suddenly dying (off-screen, no less!) The action sequences were plentiful, but each of them were quite short, in my opinion. The final duel between Harry and Voldemort could have been more epic, too.However, there are some very good scenes that stand out and overshadows its flaws. Alan Rickman's Snape is fleshed out in a very proper manner and the audience sympathizes with him. Then, Albus Dumbledore returns briefly for an engaging and meaningful final talk with Harry (while the production design for that scene alone has shades of Kubrick). Finally, the film (and the series before it) ends with an epilogue that will surely leave the fans teary-eyed once the credits start to roll.Is it spectacular? Yes. Kind of. You get what you paid for. Those who walk in the cinema hall without reading the books or watching the previous seven films will be dumbfounded to what is going on in the film. Those who have, and those who endure the series, will find it hard to say goodbye to their beloved characters that they have come to know and love for the past decade.In short, it's not as great as I expected, but it's not too cheesy and not too overblown, it's actually pretty darn good. And the ending is sentimentally joyful and a fitting farewell to Harry and his friends.Taking 'Deathly Hallows' as one entire film, it is a big, grand, epic, dark and emotionally satisfying conclusion to one of the most successful film franchises of all time.Kudos to J.K. Rowling, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and others. It's been a wild and nostalgic ride, but like all great stories, it all ends here. Farewell to the Boy Who Lived, and may he enchant us again when we revisit him either by book or by Blu-Ray.Part II rating: 71/100Part I rating: 75/100Overall rating for Deathly Hallows: 73/100",7,4,8,13 July 2011
Godzilla," Return of the King
","There is a scene in Gareth Edwards' 'Godzilla' that made my skin crawl. It is the HALO jump sequence, promoted heavily in the teaser trailer, accompanied by György Ligeti's hair-curling orchestral piece 'Requiem', made famous in Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' when Dave Bowman entered that portal. The sight of minuscule soldiers falling down into apocalyptic clouds as they see destruction all around them with gigantic, moving shadows is a work of terrifying, spectacular beauty; one of the best recent film sequences I've seen and heard. To experience it in IMAX 3D adds to the nightmare fuel.Some other startling bits involve numerous disaster sequences that so closely echoes various natural disasters of the past decade. Viewers may be reminded of terrible events like the tsunamis and earthquakes of 2004 and 2011 and the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Scenes like these will definitely strike a chord in those who fear mother nature's wrath, but of course they play second fiddle to the real star of the show, who like Colonel Kurtz in 'Apocalypse Now', doesn't show up until the latter half of the film, but one can definitely sense its brooding, commanding presence.Yes, 60 Years since it laid waste to Tokyo, the King of the Monsters triumphantly returns to the big screen after a 10-year sabbatical in this mammoth-sized entertainment that shifts the Big G into summer blockbuster territory, obliterating Roland Emmerich's turkey into smithereens.Like last summer's 'Pacific Rim', 'Godzilla' features gigantic-scale action set-pieces and crowd-pleasing moments, though in large part due to Edwards' skillful and intelligent direction, it entirely eclipses the latter film. Edwards (in only his second directorial feature following the 2010 microbudget 'Monster') probably felt the same thing a lot of people did in 'Pacific Rim' - too much action sequences that were dragged out for the purpose of pleasing its core audience. He is wise to limit Godzilla's appearance until the second half of the film, and even so limit his presence until the explosively entertaining climax, taking a page or two from Hitchcock and Spielberg's 'Jaws' about restraint. The film was made with a 'spectator' point of view - the audience sees Godzilla as if they were really seeing him, be it the TV screen or while avoiding the unrelenting chaos around them. Edwards didn't just learn from Spielberg as much as he pays a glowing tribute ala J.J. Abrams' 'Super 8'. See if you can spot the references to 'Jaws' and 'Close Encounters' in this review. There's even references to 'War of the Worlds' and 'Saving Private Ryan', among other movies. Not that it isn't a real film. Whilst 'Pacific Rim' is a film tailor-made for fans of the kaiju/mecha genre, in the same mold that most Marvel superhero films and 'Expendables' films cater to their target audiences, 'Godzilla' is made like an old-fashioned blockbuster, down from its gripping, foreboding opening to its doom-shrouded action-packed climax that provides a well-earned catharsis to the ominous buildup from the previous 90-minutes. The action sequences are a combination of the classic kaiju franchise with the ominous Biblical paintings of Gustave Doré, especially in the final 30 minutes. Seamus McGarvey's tactful cinematography and Alexandre Desplat's brooding, wildly unleashing orchestral score complement some truly awesome visual effects perfectly to make for the most visually stunning outing of the King yet.Not that there isn't a plot. Max Borenstein's screenplay details something too spoiler that even the mere mention of the basic plot will give away too much, so I won't But the trailers do a damn good job about hiding the true plot of the film, which I must say is formulaic on the human characters' side, but pretty well-written and frenetic for the most part.Oh right, there are other cast members in the film too, all A-listers, ranging from a brief Bryan Cranston giving a combination of Roy Neary and Walter White, Ken Watanabe looking as wise and mournful as the great Takashi Shimura in the original, and a military David Strathairn giving heavy-duty exposition as usual. Add Juliette Binoche, Sally Hawkins and Elizabeth Olsen as obligatory female characters and we have ourselves a heck of a cast that is severely underused. But we didn't come to see a Godzilla movie for a cast surely deserving of an Oscar Bait film. Pretty much the only human who takes center stage is tough, stoic military vet Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson of 'Kick-Ass' fame), who defiantly holds his own against all odds and comes off as a character who demands attention as to what his next plan of action is as chaos rumbles all around him.Bottom line is, I liked what I saw, and Edwards has done a truly bang-up job resurrecting the King of the Monsters from cult fascination. If possible, watch it in IMAX 3D to savor the visual effects and sheer scale, and to hear that famous, mighty roar in terrifying rumbles. It's been a long time coming, but the King is back, and the monster movie is replenished with a vengeance. Would Toho/Legendary mind if I request a future outing?",6,1,2,16 May 2014
Looper," Time and Crime doesn't pay either way
","What would you do if one day you had a heart-to-heart talk with yourself, which is decades older than you? What if you were a hit-man and you were ordered to take out yourself? Such questions and much more are posed in Rian Johnson's 'Looper', an excellent addition to the science- fiction genre. No wait, it isn't just science-fiction, it's also an action thriller and a crime drama (complete with noir-like narration) with a healthy dollop of romance. This movie knocked my socks off.In the future, time-travel is illegal, and yet somehow some criminals managed to get their hands on the technology, and send targets back in time to be assassinated by hit men called Loopers. These Loopers, such as Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) live rich when the economic structure of the rest of society is crumbling around them. However, a thing called 'closing the loop' happens when the Loopers kill older versions of themselves sent back from the future - effectively eliminating all trace of the Loopers back to the organization which hired them. Trouble befalls Joe when he lets his guard down enough to let his older self (Bruce Willis) escape. How a young Kansas farm lady (Emily Blunt) and her son fit into this plot I will not reveal. One might be thinking 'A- ha! I know where this is going' in many scenes, but Johnson is smarter than that. He has a trick up every sleeve, turning a potential cliché over its head. Such an intense ride. Such superb writing by Johnson who also directs the film with flair, and kinetics when duty calls him to. This being his first mainstream film, who knows what he'll come up with next.Looper delivers. An ingenious, intelligent, daring screenplay which brings a fresh and thought-provoking twist to the time-travel genre while also inverting it. It has brutal violence in between the genuinely thrilling, adrenaline pumping action sequences - adding raw edge to the film. It is also a strong morality play - it blurs the line between hero-isms and villainous acts. The younger Joe, the hero of the film played by Gordon-Levitt in a smart-aleck performance, is a thug that kills people for money and luxury. The older version of the character as portrayed by Willis is a bruised, tortured, intense soul underneath all that toughness, a wounded, broken man who is determined to set things right his way - however morally skewered it is. Not forgetting a vulnerable and fragile performance by Blunt who provides a strong emotional and (non-cliché) romantic core to the younger Joe, and a mischievous, mysterious yet witty act from little Pierce Gagnon, who maintains the right balance of emotions for the role. Not forgetting Jeff Daniels as a businessman-like supervisor for the Loopers - charismatic at times, brutal at others.Some very good cinematography by Steve Yedlin really shows nice, wide angles and refreshingly crisp action sequences in their glory - and also showcases the sleek production design, a futuristic Kansas metropolis not unlike the city of Blade Runner, only with more impoverished people. The special effects are good for what the budget is for the film but I strongly appreciate its subtlety for not choking on unnecessary CGI. It actually enhances the intensity of the film. Editing is crisp and paces the film nicely, without leaving too much or too little. Nathan Johnson's score is very good, actually, some old-school action orchestra work among the subtler parts can be heard here, with perfect timing, and it is a fine addition to the movie.'Looper' is extremely entertaining and yet one hell of a film. Very intense and thrilling, very exciting, very thought provoking, substantially emotional and stylish and ultimately just damn great. We might see a cult of fans hoarding this movie soon. Just when you think there's hardly any more original sci-fi flicks, out comes this wallop of a film - surprisingly one of 2012's very best.Overall: 90%Eat your heart out, 'Inception'.",8,6,17,28 September 2012
Heat," The fastest and possibly one of, if not the, best three hours of your movie-going life.
","Acted to perfection, rich in character traits, taut direction,... these words simply never can do this film justice.What began as a simple tale of cops and robbers suddenly develops into insightful and poignant characterization, the boundaries between good and evil, and facing up to one's demons. Yes, not only did this film deliver by the thrills, it gave us, the audience, an in depth look at the lives of two equal men who work on opposite sides of the law, and how their routines affect them, in the city of Los Angeles.First off, I would like to say that the acting in this movie is extremely well. You really emphasize with the characters and, for some, fell a sort of sympathy towards them. Kudos to Pacino and De Niro for playing the dedicated detective and disciplined thief, respectively. Both these men are exceptionally excellent actors and in this film, their acting is done to perfection. Without them, the film is nothing. Notable performances in the film: Val Kilmer, Natalie Portman, Diane Venora, Amy Brenneman, and of course the lovely Ashley Judd.For the cinematography, I must say that Dante Spinotti has done a tremendous job with the scenery. The city of LA has never looked this wide or gritty until this film. The nighttime scenes and the helicopter flybys of the film are stunning to watch, as it majestically captures a sparkling portrait of Los Angeles set against an urban world.To accompany the cinematography, the music by Elliot Goldenthal is unforgettable. Especially the arrangements with the Kronos Quartet. It really adds to the entire atmosphere and theme of the movie.Kudos to director/writer Michael Mann. The direction is taut (as mentioned earlier) and whip-smart, the story fantastically evolving and original, and the screenplay is well-written. The action scenes were extremely well-handled, and is kinetic and heart pounding, and best - and most important of all, realistic. This is what makes it stand out from the rest of the other crime films - they tend to put in moments of Deux Ex Machina, such as the police knowing every trick up the crooks' sleeve - but not this film. It's good, because Mann is dedicated to show both sides of the cop vs. criminal story, and he succeeds with masterful results. From this film and Collateral, I can tell he is a skilled and dedicated filmmaker when it comes to crime thrillers. By the time the film ends you won't even know three hours have passed.In short, this film is nothing short of a masterpiece. It will stand the test of time for many, many years to come. If you manage to see it in a store, or while channel-surfing, do yourselves a favor and watch it. If you consider a fan of Pacino and/or De Niro, watch it. If you are crime movie fan, action fan or even a movie buff, you MUST watch it. I assure you readers, you will never get disappointed by this film.9.994/10Delton.",10,8,14,19 April 2008
Cloud Atlas," To and fro, back and forth...
","'Cloud Atlas' is an epic film that left me breathless, speechless, and wanting more. The films' virtuoso craftmanship beckons, nay, returns to an era long gone where the writers and the directors, not the studios, were given complete creative control over how their movies should look, feel and be. The fact that this film is nearly 3 hours in length shows the film's brilliant refusal to compromise itself for the sake of marketability.As the films' six main story lines strongly weave together like a cane basket, we progress from a number of different genres, from period adventure, to forbidden period romance, to conspiracy thriller, to slapstick black comedy, to futuristic/post-apocalyptic science fiction. Many characters weave to and fro, some will meet again in the next timeline in the most unexpected of waves. So is life. How ponderous.Such extraordinary and introspective screen writing is handled perfectly along with top-notch filmmaking skills by Lana and Andy Wachowski, and Tom Tykwer. Yes, three filmmakers. Lana and Andy, responsible for 'The Matrix' trilogy, and Tykwer, famous for 'Run Lola Run' and 'Perfume' have triumphed with supremely ambitious, visionary and focused filmmaking. 'Cloud Atlas', the trio's labour of love, is as good as any film they have made, perhaps far more better. This film is Terrence Malick mixed with Ridley Scott. Probably.This is the work of great artists who have collaborated artistically and professionally to create this one-of-a-kind movie. Supreme visual effects and good cinematography interweave with great variable performances from the impressive ensemble (Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Doona Bae, Jim Sturgess, Ben Whishaw, Jim Broadbent, Keith David, Susan Sarandon, Hugh Grant), flawless production design, interesting make-up effects and terrific music by Tykwer, Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimek (Pale 3, a favourite of mine). A lot of hard work and effort went into this film and it pays off, with Tykwer and the Wachowskis transforming David Mitchell's novel into a daring, complex, intelligent and intriguing Grade-A work of cinematic modern art.Good movies are ones that leave you satisfied and memorable. Great movies will leave you wondering long after the movie is over. Excellent movies are the ones which leaves you speechless and makes you want to discuss its philosophies with almost everyone you see on the street. Are we all connected by the fabric of time? Do we remember each other in previous lives? Are we all indirectly connected to each other, this life of the next? And so on.I truly cannot say more for this extraordinary film. This film is a work of genius(es), and I cannot wait to see it again. 3 hours have never gone by so fast. May this film be rewarded richly in the coming years.Overall: 95%",8,7,13,26 October 2012
Easy A," Stone and Gluck make it work; this is the year's best comedy and the best teen film since the '80s.
","We've all been through high-school before. We've all faced this - angst, fitting in, etc. It becomes too worrying and too much discussed about in today's society that high-school angst has become somewhat of a cliché in modern media, be it books, music, and movies - due to the ever increasing number of teenagers reading/listening/watching these high- school stuff - they can relate to it.Will Gluck's 'Easy A' may very well be a great teen comedy - perhaps the best since John Hughes' teen classics from the '80s (that this film does so proudly pay homage to and reference as well), and with an injection of intelligence to boot. This is a rare comedy that not only makes you care and connect with the characters, it ironically defines the 'status quo' and the rumor mill of high school and plays it for genuine laughs, and not just cheap stabs at it.From a witty and razor-sharp script by Bert V. Royal (that manages to satirize every teen cliché past and present from dating to Facebook), director Will Gluck manages to balance perfect comedy timing, whip-smart dialogue and the actor's charming performances without overusing or overplaying the joke to the extent of gross exaggeration. Here, a little lie by 'unknown' Olive that is mis-understandingly heard by other people and thus places her in the rumor mill of her high school, where her lie is spread like wildfire. Rather than trying to get rid of the rumor at first, Olive comes up with a strategy to get herself known to school and then bravely capitalizes and even expands the rumor to become the 'harlot' of the school, so to speak. She even refers herself sometime to the main character Hester from the novel 'The Scarlet Letter' to which this film is also largely influenced by, but done in a comedic way (the film also takes numerous jabs at the so- called disastrous Demi Moore/Gary Oldman film hilariously).This is where teenage angst and the whole nine yards comes in and it's pretty true. If you don't have sex, you're a nobody. If you do have sex and you're a female, that automatically qualifies you as 'impure', so to speak, by other people of the same age and slightly older. Royal also plays the rumor mill like a toy and he gleefully but not grossly exaggerates the spread of rumors like wildfire. Gluck uses this and with some light and fleet-footed direction he lively brings this the characters and story to a medium that can be enjoyed by anyone over the age of the suitable PG-13 rating, so as long as they're not strictly and overtly Christian, which this film also brilliantly satirizes very well. Yes, it is hilarious and smart, but at times it can become dramatic - and justifiably so - especially at the second half of the movie. You really feel for the character Olive that you wouldn't mind the comedic timing being off a bit. And there are a few clichés, but they are both played straight and cleverly referenced, well-woven together by Gluck that one wouldn't mind seeing there.Emma Stone is a charming, adorable and talented young actress with perfect comedy timing and here she puts her charm, looks and wit to terrific use. She fits the lead role Olive perfectly like a glove and you are firmly placed at her side and will be rooting for her character. If there is any indication that Stone will become a big name in the future than this film certainly proves it. The other actors are also great thank's to Gluck's direction - Amanda Bynes as the too-super Christian Marianne is terrific and she handles a very satirical part very well. I especially enjoyed Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci's performances as Olive's parents - they are not only 100% supportive of their children, but they are also carefree, extremely like-able AND reasonable, something not too commonly seen in many teen movies. Maybe it's due to their hippie-like personalities. I can't say, I like 'em. Penn Badgley, Dan Byrd, Thomas Haden Church, Cam Gigandet, Aly Michalka and some brief appearances by Malcolm McDowell and Lisa Kudrow round up the solid supporting ensemble, but it is Stone's show here and she picks it up and runs with it all the way to the finish line.More than a teen movie with heart - Will Gluck's 'Easy A' is everything a teen flick should be - fun, sassy and lively. At the same time, 'Easy A' accomplishes other feats quite unusual for teen films - it is an intelligent social satire that isn't just on the high school 'status quo' and 'rumor mill' (lest we forget extreme Christian followers like Marianne), it is both a satire and a tribute to John Hughes and his teen films of the '80s as well as 'The Scarlet Letter', and a star- making role from the ever-promising and witty Emma Stone. It is easily the best modern teen comedy (perhaps of the decade?) that I have seen in a while and the best comedy of 2010.The crew-members and cast may be different and John Hughes may be gone but his spirit and influence is ever-present in this film and he lives on here.Overall rating: 76/100",6,0,0,25 December 2010
Fast Five," Justin Lin and Chris Morgan are just what the franchise needed
","This is the fifth movie in the 'Fast and Furious' franchise. Fifth. You'd think the franchise would burn out by the third film and drift into direct-to-video territory like so many unfortunate film franchises today (here's looking at you, American Pie), but Fast Five sort of breaks the taboo and proves that, even at the fifth movie, it can still be entertaining and appealing as hell.Sure the acting and screenplay aren't exactly Oscar worthy, but for this genre it does the job great. Vin and Paul, along with many of the reunited cast of the franchise (Matt Schulze, Tyrese, Ludicrous, Sung Kang, Gal Gadot among others) make for a damn good action team, and the nostalgic value of seeing these different sequel's characters teaming up and joking around is one of the best aspects of the film. Oh, that and seeing Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel duke it out mano-e-mano, to see who is the better tough guy.Chris Morgan and Justin Lin are to take credit here. The first movie was solid, but light on acting and story. The second movie was just dumb. The third movie in which Lin and Morgan joined in, was a bit dull but still kept some interesting bits. The fourth movie reunited the original cast members but it felt a bit boring due to some story developments, but hey, you can't blame them for trying.This time around, however, Lin and Morgan improved a lot. Morgan tweaks with the sequel, transforming it into a heist film rather than the first and third films which focused on racing, and the second and fourth films which focused on getting a badder criminal. In this sequel the baddie is a corrupt politician/gang leader played by Joaquim de Almeida (Bucho from 'Desperado') so you know he's going to be a really nasty villain. The characters are now quite fleshed out and interact more with each other, showing a more older and vulnerable side of them since the last time we saw them in previous films.Lin shows off his (improved) knack for action sequences. There are some really good stuff to be seen here, one of which involves a train and the other which involves the near-total destruction of the streets of Rio de Janeiro. What is impressive is that most, if not all of these action sequences are shot live-action as opposed to CGI (I never liked the climax involving CG tunnels in the fourth movie). While there are few racing scenes, the last action set-piece, is truly a sight to behold. It is preposterous, yet utterly exciting and hilarious to watch due to the truly amazing stunt work put together by Lin and crew. I've never seen destruction this frenzied and exciting since James Bond's pleasant tank drive in St. Petersburg in 'GoldenEye'.It has to be said anyway - this is the best of the franchise, hands down. Morgan and Lin took the franchise to a different and quite mature direction, and let's hope the sixth (yes, it was mentioned a week ago) will be as good, if not better, than this one. This is great entertainment and a solid start to the summer.P.S. Stay after the first part of the credits. Trust me.Overall rating: 73/100",6,1,2,6 May 2011
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," The best of the 'Twilight' series... which isn't really that big of an improvement.
","OK, first off, I am not a fan of the Twilight series, nor am I a hater. I'm just a neutral in-between casual movie-goer. I am also not a book reader, so stop reading this review if you want to compare the film with the book. I would also like to mention that the first 'Twilight' movie was mediocre but the second movie was just plain abysmal, in my humble opinion. And also, I personally find the fan frenzy over the entire 'Twilight' franchise, book or movie, completely overblown. I mean, come on. Lovers are voting a 10 and haters (most of which who haven't even watched the movie yet) are voting a 1. People, if you don't like the movie, don't see it and bash it unreasonably. Let the movie critics do that for you.That being said, 'Eclipse' is leaps and bounds better than 'New Moon', and some steps up above the first. Apart from the screenplay and dialog (which is still bland and mostly uninspired) and special effects (which are on par with 'New Moon'... which isn't really that much of a compliment), the acting, music and especially direction has improved significantly.Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner. Yes, they have genuinely improved slightly in terms of acting and chemistry. Heck even the quips they give each other are believable; Edward's quip about Jacob 's lack of a shirt made me chuckle. Some of the actors in the dark parts of the film display genuine fear and emotion, something that was lost in the previous two films. And near the end, Pattinson challenges an enemy by personally taunting them where it hurts most, and you can see the fury in each of their eyes. Other actors also get their moment to shine; Jackson Rathbone and Elizabeth Reiser in particular as Jasper and Esme Cullen, Billy Burke who made me laugh more than ever in any of the previous movies, heck even Dakota Fanning improves with an ever increasing mysterious aura around her. Bryce Dallas Howard is sadly wasted as her villainous role is nothing more than an extended cameo appearance if you count the minutes she's on screen.However, the script is just as boring as the previous two, with so much predictability and wooden stiffness to it that, I felt like it was bordering on just plain stupidity. OK, yeah I get the old 'no-one-else- but-you' type of clichÃ© and I kinda appreciated the fact that the hero is trying his best to get the girl away from his dangerous life to no avail and to the rival's delight, but it is written in a very stunted way that it looks as if the girl switches from one boy to another like clothes hangers. It's kinda stupid if you ask me.Production design is good but getting unoriginal, fast (it's basically the same as the previous two), while the cinematography is great in which you get to see beautiful panoramic scenery and/or the wolf pack's shirtless abs. It's a mixed bag, that one.Call me a movie freak, but one of the best thing worth watching (or listening) in the movie is Howard Shore's fantastic orchestral score, which is rousing and sweeping, and best of all easily suits the film. Compared to Carter Burwell's atmospheric score in the first film and Alexandre Desplat's great but horrifyingly mismatched score in the second, this one feels more suitable and gives out even more emotions than the actors themselves. And during the battle preparation and action sequences, one can't help but wonder when Frodo and the Fellowship are going to show up to aid their battle.Finally, director David Slade. The film's action sequences and moody/grim parts has his style all over it. Even during some of the talk scenes, the camera shakes in a similar way to that of Slade's previous films 'Hard Candy' and '30 Days of Night'. Heck, the very well-handled action sequences is basically a PG-13 '30 Days of Night' with no blood and extra werewolves thrown into the mix. From the moment the film starts, his taut direction immediately puts you into the action. But most of the action is near the film's end. Moreover, it's a huge surprise to why Slade ever got dragged into the 'Twilight' franchise: he should be doing more gory films instead of this. Nevertheless, an interesting director does not make a bad script into a terrific movie, but at least Slade does his best with the material he's given.In short, although the third time's the charm with the 'Twilight' franchise, it's still adequate, and it's mostly a hit and miss with the movie-going crowd. If you hate 'Twilight' you're gonna hate/stay away from this one; if you love it, you're gonna love this one. Simple. As a normal movie reviewer, this is just nothing more than a decent time waster, with romance, vampires, werewolves and CGI.One could wonder what Bill Condon could do with 'Breaking Dawn'.Entertainment value: 6/10Overall: 5/10",4,0,2,8 July 2010
Slumdog Millionaire," This decade's 'Rocky'; undeniably appealing and masterfully done.
","First off, I want to rant (sorry) - for the year 2008, there were three films I gave a 10/10 rating, this film, 'WALL-E', and 'The Dark Knight'. The latter was snubbed of its Academy Awards Nominations for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay, all because that the Academy does not deem superhero summer blockbusters as art. I was mad as personally I think TDK is the film of the decade, and had it been nominated for the three, I'd think it win them.Thankfully, this film and WALL-E, two romantic films, do the Oscars justice. WALL-E is a marvel. However, I'd give my hats off to Slumdog for giving me the biggest movie surprise of the year. The movie is energetic, has a kinetic pace, a touching story, and a main character that we all root for. Director Danny Boyle takes a story and crafts it into one of the most startlingly original films of the decade, and it stands tall over most films.We have Jamal, a Mumbai 'slumdog' who participates in a 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire' TV game show in hopes that the love of his life will see him. He apparently knows all the answers to the questions and shows no sign of losing. This prompts investigators to interrogate him, and, clues to how he knows the answers are represented in flashbacks of his life leading him up to where he is.The movie cannot be praised without the fine, innocent and heart-stealing characters that the young actors portray. They embody the innocence, curiosity, and enthusiasm of youth. Without them, the film would be nothing. They can all stand up and take a bow, for their performances mold the film to near-perfection.The film's story, while uplifting and inspiring at times, is gut-wrenching, gritty, powerful, and, filled with realism. How the screenwriter makes the story believable is truly remarkable, as it takes talent and dedication to do it, and it shows on the silver screen. Having the kids speak Hindi for 1/3 of the film adds more realism to the film, as the young starlets are more comfortable speaking in their native tongue, as well as showing real life in the slums the way a Hindi kid would see it. There is not one scene where you do not cheer for the main character, Jamal. And the ending is truly marvelous, an ending that will be remembered for a long time.The direction is superb. Fast paced, giving little time to breathe. Obvious Danny Boyle. But, he livens up the atmosphere of the movie, which is dark and gritty. This is Boyle's best film yet, he is truly a filmmaker for his time, and this film certainly proves it. Hell, even in the poor slums there are moments that we can laugh and reflect at! Now that's something that Boyle can be proud of, making the audience feel and care for the characters, to which he succeeds enormously. There is a scene involving an open toilet and Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan, for which I will not tell, that has become one of the most memorable movie scenes for the decade. Academy Award Winner Danny Boyle, you deserve it.Technically speaking, the music by Bollywood regular A. R. Rahman is perfect for the film. It is uplifting, gritty, beautiful, thrilling and atmospheric at the same time. He deserves the Oscar win. The cinematography shows the ugly slums of Mumbai in full glory, capturing the essence of the film while making it beautiful at the same time. The editing is nicely done making it fast paced.'Slumdog Millionaire' is an uplifting, near-flawless masterpiece. It drips with movie magic and reminds us why we fell in love with the movies in the first place. To be honest I wanted 'The Dark Knight' to win, but since it was not nominated, Slumdog was my clear favorite to win the coveted Best Picture award. And hey, it did! Congrats to everyone on the film. Bravo! And finally, Bollywood has something to be proud of, and Hollywood should partner up with them again sometime soon.Overall rating: 9/10",6,3,11,24 February 2009
The Social Network," A film which superbly defines our generation today while also telling a great origin story.
","Sometimes you can tell whether or not you're watching a good film by either looking at your watch and wondering whether or not the film is going to end soon. 'The Social Network' is a brilliant film, because I didn't check my watch, not even once, nor did I ponder about when the film was going to end because it was so good I didn't want it to end.Many people had doubts about this film before its release. A movie about the origins of Facebook, the social networking site. Eyes were rolled, undoubtedly. Then, as soon as acclaimed filmmaker David Fincher and equally acclaimed screenwriter Aaron Sorkin became attached to the project, suddenly the buzz was about. Needless to say, the film blew away my expectations.I can honestly say that this has got to be the best acting ensemble I've see all year. Jesse Eisenberg is just astounding as Mark Zuckerberg, the arrogant, frank, calculative, and very sarcastic but non-the-less super- smart protagonist. The character is written in a way that it doesn't resemble the cliché Hollywood nerd hero - Zuckerberg in this movie is a cold, manipulative jerk in some moments of the film. But, like all humans, he is flawed - he has a personality, and Eisenberg portrays that flawed side of him with confidence and with a huge dose of wit to boot. Andrew Garfield also gives a nuanced performance as Zuckerberg's (ex) best friend Eduardo Saverin, whose performance ranges from cocky to quiet/calm and finally, outrage. The Winklevoss twins are played to cocky perfection by Armie Hammer, a feat considering it's one actor playing two characters, and he does a fantastic job at both of the characters' various degrees. The rest of the youthful cast all deserve praise - Justin Timberlake, Max Minghella, Brenda Song and Rooney Mara... Heck Eisenberg and Garfield should definitely get Oscar nominations at the very least for their performances, and the entire cast - among the finest of young acting talent today - deserves a Screen Actors Guild Award.The screenplay - another aspect of the film which I love - is filled to the brim with fantastic dialog and with great coherence to boot. Every line feels natural, the actors that speak them breathe life and fresh air into them, and it pulls you even further into this story which is already being done justice by the acting. Sorkin gives solid footing and strength to the story, and the dialog just dances around naturally around the audience for them to savor every moment that is shown to them - similar to Quentin Tarantino movies. Sorkin deserves another Oscar nomination because he manages to turn a potentially uninteresting and boring premise into one of the most gripping, exhilarating and powerful screenplays of the last decade. I'm not joking. You are pulled into this breakneck world of Zuckerberg and you either enjoy or hate the ride that Sorkin has written out for us. Either way, it's a hell of an experience.Which comes to the question - does David Fincher deserve another Oscar nomination for this film? Undeniably. It is under his superb direction that the actors bring their best to their roles and the screenplay given such life. Not once did the film feel contrived or clichéd - even though it's a true story and we expect it to be. We are curious to know what happens next - this is the beauty of Fincher's craft. Amidst the factors mentioned above as well as the glossy production design, the simple yet beautiful cinematography and the slick and very coherent editing, Fincher's direction brings this all together under his brilliant supervision. This is the work of a master film director at his best, and truly his best film since 'Se7en' and 'Fight Club' more than a decade ago. That's saying something.On an extra note the electronic music score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is just outstanding and brilliant; it perfectly suits the situations, atmosphere, and era of the film, and should hearken yet another Oscar nomination - the first of its kind.Many of us are Facebook users. Fact. We use it for all kinds of social activities - making new friends, letting people know what you're up to, getting people to know you more, and so on. 'The Social Network' is an outstanding film which explores the origins of this phenomenon, where our protagonist is not an easy character to like, moreover he is overcome with friendship, lies and betrayal just to get this site up and running. We all may had our drama, but mostly nothing compared to what Zuckerberg had to face during the entire ordeal. The film begins loudly, progresses at a breakneck pace, and ends quite solemnly, and we all feel for him. You'll never look at Facebook the same way again after watching this film. Since most of us are all obsessed with this social networking and blogging trend, it comes to no surprise that this is the film that defines our generation today, and it does so with gracefulness and power.So far this is my pick for the best film of 2010. And 'Inception' was damn good, too.Overall rating: 94/100",9,0,1,28 November 2010
Up in the Air," One of the decade's best movies.
","George Clooney unlocks himself here as a versatile actor, not afraid of showing his age, and becoming afraid of it. Here we see him as a man who lives life to the fullest, all alone and isolated from his close ones and society, in order to get a seemingly meaningless goal as he drifts along life. His job is to fire people throughout the country and it's VERY personal. On the other hand, we see the people that he fires, full of anger and sorrow. What will they tell their family? How are they gonna survive for tomorrow?Rather than forcing us to accept the truth, 'Up In The Air' shows us both sides without choosing any and allows us to make our own choice. Director Jason Reitman directs this film with a subtle edge that gives the film a sort of steady pace, not frenetic but not too slow either. Add to that a sexually charged performance by Vera Farmiga and a very lively/cute and sensitive performance by Anna Kendrick (hope she gets a better agent after this, she's WAY more talented to be starring in tween-crap like 'Twilight'). Add to that some memorable appearances by Jason Bateman, Zach Galifianakis and J. K. Simmons, you've got yourself a near-flawless dramedy.What makes 'Up In The Air' works is how relevant it is to society today. It's hard economic times like these that we understand the characters on the movie, we feel for them, but as the movie points out, life goes on. And the ones who are suffering will be comforted by their families back home. That one point really brought home the movie for me.Overall rating: 9/10",7,0,2,10 March 2010
