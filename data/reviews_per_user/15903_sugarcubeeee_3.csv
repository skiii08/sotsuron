National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Awesome!
","Okay I love this movie! The beginning was really good when it showed the assassination of President Lincoln and the death of Thomas Gates. I really liked how this movie had a good plot and was so jam packed with action. The humor was really well written too, especially in Buckingham Palace when Abigail and Ben caused a big scene. That was really funny to see the somewhat serious Ben acting like a drunk idiot! I really loved the Gold City too. I don't really get though why Abby would kick Ben out of HIS house, but at least he moves in again at the end. My favorite part I think is when Riley finds his car being towed and he starts chasing after it. That'd be really bad to have your Red Ferrari towed and having to pay six million bucks for it. But at least he gets it in the end for free. If you are free sometime, see this movie!",10,1,4,1 January 2008
The Dark Knight," a-
","My overall rating of the Dark Knight gets an a-. I'm with the critics on this one. Overall the movie was an intense film a lot of violence a lot of shootings. But the parents rating it could be an R rating? No.Heath Ledgers performance as the Joker was superb. a++. Heath's best part was when he crashed Bruce Wayne's party and when he would say 'Why so serious?' He would stick his knife to the person and say 'You know why I use a knife? My father did it to me and he would say Why so serious?'Christian Bale's acting as Batman was a b rating. He wasn't that great in the movie he played a solid Batman.Harvey Dent was a strange character and was a d- actor he did terrible in the movie.Beginning: a- Middle a- Ending d-The ending was bad the Joker didn't even do anything neither did Batman all it was was Batman running from the cops. So anyways the movie was good enough to see. If you want to see it, definitely do it. Thanks guys for reading this review.Readers note: This movie was very intense so if you don't like action packed or intense movies don't see this movie.",10,1,3,23 July 2008
National Treasure," Two Thumbs Up!
","I went to visit my friend one day. She said we had to watch National Treasure because she knew I would love it. I said in a bored voice,'Fine.' I figured I wouldn't like the movie much because it's not what I usually watch. I was so wrong. I was on the edge of my seat during this awesome, action-packed movie. I enjoyed the big explosion at the beginning when they were looking for the treasure on The Charlotte. I loved how Riley was really funny and how amazingly huge that treasure room was. This movie is an awesome movie you can take the whole family to see and it won't be too boring or stupid. I recommend this movie to people who like humor, action, historical fiction, and slight romance. In this movie they combine all these cool things and pack it altogether in a movie that will delight almost anyone of any age. I really enjoyed this movie and it is now one of my favorites. Basically, I really like this movie and a bit of advice: Critics can be really wrong.",10,0,3,21 December 2007
