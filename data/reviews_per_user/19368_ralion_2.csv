First Man," Nice view behind story of the first man
","Good to see the more realistic view behind this story, although this story would also be nice after he got famous and lost his family. But very good scenery, acting and editing in my taste",8,0,1,22 October 2018
A Star Is Born," Great begin, but not convincing towards the end
",In the beginning of the film the chemical love between Brad and Gaga pops of the screen. But from the moment Gaga steps into The Star it's like you watch the summary of too much material of filming or ten episodes of a soap drama serie. Very fast timelapses and shortened scenery seem to hide something maybe just by using only the good stuff of acting. A pity because the story deserves better.,5,2,7,22 October 2018
