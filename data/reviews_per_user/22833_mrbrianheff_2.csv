The Rock," Great Music
","The Music in this movie is the best i have ever seen.  It gives the movie such feeling that you can automatically get into the movie.  It has at least 5 different themes.  From the Navy Seals, The Marines, and even the patriotic sad theme that comes on from time to time, it gives the movie so much more.  The music is the best in the end scene with the planes though.  It is so powerful.",10,2,3,6 October 2002
Armageddon," Such a Good Movie
","I thought this movie was great.  Even though i waited till new years of '98 to see it.  It really moved me.  All the characters in the movie were so well played.  The story was great and the special effects were awesome.  After this, I saw deep impact and could not even finish it.  Not only was it copying Armageddon, but it sucked. Armageddon is a great and origional movie created from great producers like Bruckheimer.  Very Good Job.",9,1,3,6 October 2002
