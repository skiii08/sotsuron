National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Good Characters but Poor Writing
","National Treasure 2 the Book of Secrets is for the most part a great action adventure film and keeps you enthralled with its twisting corridors, deadly traps, strange conspiracies, and compelling characters. For the most part I actually sat at the edge of my seat wondering where the next clue would take us. However, the movie had one glaring mistake, the writing. First off were lead to believe that Ben's parents had been divorced for 32 years yet in several hours after being reunited they begin acting like they were friends for centuries. The other complaints (Spoilers) are that the city of gold the characters are after is claimed to be built by the Olmecs yet Olmecs were a South American Civilization yet the city was found in North Dakota. Third, why build an underground city of gold in the first place. The idea is basically that the Olmecs carried hundreds of tons of golds across thousands of miles and built an underground city filled with unrealistically intricate traps. Just thinking about that is ludicrous. Fourth, the villain of the movie wants to cause so much danger just because he wants to be remembered. Odd motives to say the least. So in the end the movie despite some major writing mistakes was actually quiet enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone interested in a good action adventure flick, who doesn't care about character motives or historical accuracy.",6,0,0,21 December 2007
Transformers," WAY More Then Meets The Eye
","There have been several movies that have changed my idea of thinking of the film business. King Kong and Lord of the Rings being some of them. Transformers is one of those movies, but for a different reason. When I saw the teaser trailer at Pirates of the Caribbean last year I laughed. The idea seemed absurd, but the finished product was spectacular. I not only was blown away by the action, but i was amazed at how awesome Michael Bay made a movie about a toy aimed for 8 year olds (sorry Transformers fans.) The humor was genuinely laughable. The characters (for the most part) were well written and the special effects were ground breaking. Transformers deserves its 8 out of ten. I want to give it higher but if it did i would be putting this movie with the likes of The Godfather or Return of the King and that just doesn't seem to fit.",8,1,5,21 August 2007
