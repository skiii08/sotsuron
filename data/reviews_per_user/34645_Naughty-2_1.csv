The Blair Witch Project," NO SLEEP, NO WOODS, NO OPEN WINDOWS, CAN'T TAKE IT!!
","I am a frequent horror movie viewer.  But, oh my f_ _ _ -ing God!  I am so scared when I am alone, now.  Put it this way, I left the movie crying!! Crying!!  I don't know what it is exactly, but I guess it is the fear of the unknown that really took me over.  There is no gore, no scary monster to see. Just the works of the imagination and what can actually be out in those woods.  Does anyone else keep getting flashbacks of the ending scene?  Yes, I am seeing a therapist.  This is a must see, but it will change your life...forever?! DO NOT GO SEE IT IF YOU COULDN'T HANDLE HEARING GHOST STORIES AT CAMP WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER!!",Null,0,0,6 August 1999
