The Avengers," Good, not great
","The Avengers is a dream combination of some major super heroes. It is what you can expect out of a Marvel comics movie. It has some good action(largely thanks to The Hulk), and a few moments that will make you smile (Few involving Stark/ Iron Man). However more emphasis seemed to be on these 2 characters and the other characters sort of fell behind. The movie had the potential with so many superhero characters. It could have done much more and could have been even better. Having said all this, it is a one-time watch at least.Not enough to deserve an 8.5 though.Good but not that great.",Null,2,5,17 September 2012
The Expendables," Expendables- Worth it for the action
","When a movie of this sort is about to be released, which has the most awesome line up of action stars ever assembled together, there is going to be a lot of hype and expectations naturally. When I came to know about it, I thought it might not really live up to the high expectations. But after watching the movie, I must say I quite liked it. Definitely a must watch for action movie fans. It is the dream come true for almost everybody who would have often thought- How awesome it would be to see all our favorite action stars together!The movie being directed by Sylvester Stallone also has himself as the central character along with Jason Statham who is awesome at action, and got a major part to play in this movie. Even Stallone, in spite of his age played his part sincerely. Some of the hype was also about Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis being there and though it was only for a scene, it was most enjoyable. Arnold unfortunately looks a bit too old. How I would have loved this movie to have come a few years earlier. The only negative was that the other characters were quite underdeveloped, specially their partners in the team- Jet Li, Randy Couture, Terry Crews and others. Stallone put in a strong performance with a realistic character like wherein at one point after his fight with Steve Austin when asked what happened, he says- 'Got my ass kicked'. Statham is very likable, Li besides the fight added to the humor content, Dolph Lundgren was menacing and I guess will have a major part in the next sequel, Randy Couture is quite solid in the fights and Terry Crews was effective with the gun. Steve Austin hadn't too much to do and Mickey Rourke was just as an influencer of sorts.But overall, I thoroughly enjoyed it and wanted more of it. Action lovers, go watch it especially to watch all the heroes together on the screen. But watch it with your mind kept aside, just for the action.Well done Stallone for bringing all together and putting up some good old action show!",Null,2,7,4 September 2010
Ant-Man," That's a messed-up looking dog!
","Ant-Man, another one from the Marvel comics but this isn't the great super hero movie with stunning visuals and flawless storyline. Instead it has clichés and you can find faults with it if you look for it.Nonetheless, I still enjoyed this movie immensely as I did not go in with high expectations but just to be entertained. And I was. This is a movie that is suitable for people of all age groups, but especially the kids. They would love it. The main characters, though not great are pretty good. The visuals are neat, the story line OK. The support characters add in the humor and there are some pretty good light moments in the film. Though some of it is clichéd and you know what to expect, it is enjoyable nonetheless.This is a pretty good movie to go in with your whole family and have a good time together.",Null,0,2,6 December 2015
Peaceful Warrior," Spirituality summarized
","I had no idea about this movie before I saw it but this movie really was a pleasant surprise for me. This movie is about a gymnast who is talented and has everything required to have a happy life but somewhere something is troubling him. He happens to meet a wise man and his life completely changes. It results in a complete transformation.The highlight of the movie is definitely the interactions of Dan the gymnast and 'Socrates' the wise man. Some very important and fundamental lessons and truths about life are explained, but in quite innovative and wonderful ways.However this movie is not for everyone, unless you are interested in these sort of things like spirituality.",8,1,4,26 September 2012
Die Hard," A classic action movie
","Die Hard is one of those movies that doesn't get old. It belongs to that golden era of beautiful action movies. The movie gets straight to the point and it just flows smoothly. Bruce Willis (John Mc Clane)is lovable as the NYPD cop mainly because he is not shown as an extraordinary action hero like a super hero, but because he is shown very humane. The way he too gets nervous and makes errors or the way he fights or argues with himself about the decisions that he is making. In spite of that, he uses his intelligence and training to do the best he can in the hopeless situation that he is in. You also love him for his ability to get under the skin of others.There are some other beautiful aspects to the movie like John's interactions with Sgt. Al Powell (which are not even face to face), which are touching and will bring a smile to you and the kind of connection they build even though they have never seen each other is so good. The way they have portrayed the role of the TV crew and the news channels, the way they interfere and actually do a lot of harm just to get ahead of other news channels, is worthy of applause.All in all a wonderful action movie that you can watch any time and again and again.",Null,1,1,6 October 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," The Fitting Finale
","The Dark Knight Rises, though not as good as the previous one- The Dark Knight, is fitting for the series finale. In this one, you have Bane and he has great presence throughout the movie and good rivalry with Batman. This one is more about the story and I felt as though this was closer to Batman Begins, as if completing a full circle. In BB, we had Bruce Wayne transform into the Batman and here too he again 'learnt' to be Batman. He realized that after 8 years of no life at all, he couldn't just don the mask and the cape and become Batman. He again faces fear, learns to overcome it and gets his training in a way.This movie had a feeling of completeness which is very necessary when the series has ended. The Dark Knight ends in Batman being villain in people's eyes and in this one he literally 'rises'.",Null,6,9,16 December 2012
