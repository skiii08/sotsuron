Changeling," 'I Want my son back!'
","The line above is what dragged me to the movies on a rainy night on Halloween (i mean the 3:50pm show, almost night-time eh, had to be home for supper). I found it extremely absurd for a corporation like the widely known LAPD to return a wrong child and insist on his upbringing. One can't help but laugh and think is this for real or what? But when I learned of the true events behind this picture my heart just shrank. The humor just flew out the window...This is not a laughing matter not when the disappearance of a child and his possible homicide are feared. My heart goes out to anyone who has lost a child in similar circumstances to that of Christine Collins.I was very impressed with the film's cinematography which made me delve in the late 1920's era. Also with Jolie's performance as been very alive on screen as the victimized mother of the missing child. You feel for her after all all she wanted was her son returned. Not a big story that would be made into a picture more than half a century later so people can see it nominated for an academy award. However, your alter-ego prefers the movie not to end with a safe story. I mean I really loved the fact that Eastwood made the choice to make it an open ending. After all how can you fabricate the fates of historical characters just for the sake of it.",8,6,10,31 October 2008
Silent Hill," Eerie
","Silent Hill is based on a story of a little girl Sharon who frequently sleep walks and mentions the town Silent Hill in her sleep. A desperate mother Rose Da Silva flees town and heads for silent hill to retrieve some answers. But when a car wreck separates her from her only child, the history of silent hill slowly unfolds...A good convert from game to movie, I saw this movie opening night and it was almost like the video game; except the movie was much more graphic while the video game was rather mysterious and a bit terrifying. The special effects were awesome but the plot was seemingly ordinary. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good chill. Enjoy!",7,0,1,14 June 2006
