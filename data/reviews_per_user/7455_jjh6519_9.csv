Catch Me If You Can," Enjoyable film!
","I had a lot of fun watching this movie!  Leonardo DiCaprio was given the role of a lifetime -- he is perfect for the role of a teenager who can pass for an adult, and he makes the most of it.  Teaming him with Christopher Walken as his father was a stroke of genius, as the two really resemble one another, something that never would have occurred to me.  Both of them are great, and Tom Hanks has fun with his role, too.  (I find it interesting that the Hanks role was offered first to James Gandolfini, but he had to turn it down due to his commitments to 'The Sopranos'.  I can imagine what a great comic turn Gandolfini would have had with this role as the perplexed, straight-laced FBI agent.)And Steven Spielberg, who inherited this film from other directors, took it and made it into a truly enjoyable experience.  It is probably the lightest, funniest Spielberg movie ever.",9,0,1,18 January 2003
The Others," The Ultimate Haunted House-Ghost Story!
","I have for a long time had a lot of problems with the haunted house or ghost-in-the-house type movie.  There is generally way too much screaming, gore, special effects, and worst of all, these movies tend to take their ridiculous premises way too seriously. The exception has always been 'Poltergeist', because so much warmth and humor was part of the story of a middle-class American family under siege in their nice suburban home, and because it definitely had some really scary moments. Thank you, Mr. Spielberg, one more time!So, when I first saw 'The Others', I was not expecting much.  Was I ever blown away!  First: Nicole Kidman gives one of the best performances of her career in this movie -- better even than 'To Die For' -- so why was she nominated for an Oscar for that pathetic role in 'Moulin Rouge'?   Second: This movie throws out all the other haunted house and ghost story cliches. The premise of the story is actually quite simple and believable if you believe in ghosts, and it cannot be repeated here.  See it and enjoy it. There is no blood or gore.  There are, quite frankly, no special effects. It is just a great story, within the confines of a ghost story and a haunted house setting, with a dynamite twist ending, with fantastic acting from the entire cast (especially Kidman as the strictly religious, super-control-freak mother of two very different children, and kudos to the little girl who portrays the daughter who knows too much and to the elderly lady who plays the wise nanny-housekeeper who also knows more than the mother).  Fantastic direction, moody cinematography and spooky music.This was chilling, shocking and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout, and I was watching it in my own home!   I saw it again tonight, and it still is every bit as fascinating and chilling.",10,0,0,2 November 2002
The Others," Completely surprised! Much better than expected!
","I purposely waited to see this on video because I had read enough negative reviews about this movie, that I did not want to waste my money on seeing it at the theatre.   Well, now I'm sorry I didn't see it sooner.   The negative reviews completely misled me.This is the best ghost story and haunted house story I've ever seen on film. It has completely believable characters, a lot of hints dropped throughout (which I didn't catch until the ending), a growing tension and fear, excellent acting, and perfect cinematography to capture the story.  
If you have ever been turned off by the House On Haunted Hill type movies, believe me, you will like this so much more!  It showed that this type of film does not need gore and special effects -- just a good story, the right atmosphere (music, setting and cinematography), and exceptional acting by all in the film. One question:  Why did Nicole Kidman get nominated for that flimsy role in Moulin Rouge, but not for The Others?   This is possibly her best role ever, next to To Die For.   Her portrayal of the rigidly protective mother was masterful, and she convincingly brought out the full range of emotions.I was completely surprised by the artistry of the movie, how well it gripped me as a drama as opposed to a horror flick, and how the ending just plain floored me!  This was not the B-movie I was expecting.",10,0,0,15 May 2002
The Aviator," Excellent, but ending was too abrupt
","I saw 'The Aviator' last night (Dec. 25, 2004), and thought it was exceptional film-making in so many ways. Scorsese captures the Hollywood scene so well, and the plot informed me of things I had never known about Howard Hughes.DiCaprio carries the show admirably as the very complex Huges, with both zest and enthusiasm and also the ability to effectively capture Hughes' private demons at work. DiCaprio's performance is one of his very best, and I expect him to be nominated for Best Actor.Cate Blanchett is so dead-on as Katharine Hepburn (yes, I never thought she looked anything like Hepburn, but the way she carries herself, speaks, laughs, etc. is pure Hepburn). Blanchett should be near the top of the list for consideration as Best Supporting Actress.I also thought Alan Alda's performance as the seedy Senator out to destroy Hughes (and also on the take from Hughes' competitors), was possibly the best he's turned in on the big screen. I would not be surprised to see him nominated for Best Supporting Actor.In all, the film features top-rate cinematography, direction, sets, a compelling tale, fantastic recreation of the making of old films, and great acting. The problem is with the choice of the ending. It should not have ended the way it did. Its ending would have been effective had the movie started out, as in 'Lawrence of Arabia', with the death and funeral of Hughes. But it did not, so I think people not familiar with the final days of his life, will be disappointed -- not with the fascinating film, but the abrupt way it ends.",8,8,17,26 December 2004
Pi," Kinda boring
","OK, I was told that this was a movie I HAD to see, so I rented it.  I found it fascinating at the start (paranoia mixed with genius, math mixed with religion, great black and white cinematography, etc.), but after a while, it just got repetitive, pointless and damned boring!  I kept waiting for some new insight, some resolution, some reason for this film to be made.  I waited in vain.",4,2,3,14 September 2002
Titanic," This movie is FAR better than the imdb rating!
","Previously, I wrote that I loved 'Titanic', cried at its ending (many times over), and I'm a guy in his 60's.  I also wondered about why this great movie, which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics, was given only a 7.0 rating by imdb.com users.Well, I looked at the breakdown of the user ratings.  While 29.0% of all votes gave it a 10 rating, 10.7% gave it a 1 rating.  These 10.7% of these irrational imdb users, in effect, pulled the overall rating down to 7.0.  
In my previous comments, I blamed this very unusual voting pattern (a sudden surge in 1 ratings, with a high 10 rating, dropping only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping at the 1 rating level) on only one thing: hatred for Leonardo DiCaprio.  Believe me, I've tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people (young men, mostly), who defame him left and right.  They absolutely hate the man, and they will have no part in giving him any credit in 'Titanic'.  (To answer one other user:  I am NOT talking about someone who just really doesn't like the movie that much, and gave it a 5 or a 6, etc.  Everyone has, and is entitled to, his/her own taste.  But no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only 7.0 overall for 'Titanic', pulled to that level by an inordinate number of ridiculous 1 ratings, is a fair reflection of the overall motion picture.)Let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of 'Titanic' to 5 randomly chosen box office and critical 'bombs' (there are many more, but these 5 will prove my point).  'Heaven's Gate' (1980) was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing, and imdb voters' ratings were: 23.2% 10 ratings and 9.2% 1 ratings (overall rating of 6.1).  'Big Top Pee-wee' (1988) got 4.3% 10 ratings and 9.9% 1 ratings (overall rating of 4.5).  'Cat People' (1982) got 6.1% 10 ratings and 2.6% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.8).   'Blind Date' (1987) got 3.0% 10 ratings and 2.8% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.3).  'Jumpin' Jack Flash' (1986) got 4.4% 10 ratings and 3.7% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.2).  WHAT DO ALL OF THESE FILMS HAVE IN COMMON WITH 'TITANIC'?  ALL OF THE PERCENTAGES OF THEIR 1 RATINGS ARE LOWER !!!! THAN 'TITANIC', AND NONE OF THESE STINKERS EVER WAS NOMINATED FOR A SINGLE AWARD.  Again, 'Titanic' got 10.7% 1 ratings!  Compare that to the other 5 movies I just mentioned.Can there be any explanation other than the hatred of Leo factor?",10,3,6,8 October 2002
Titanic," Object of a massive hate campaign
","I am aghast at the comments of others on this site about 'Titanic'.  A sense of outright hatred spews forth.  Finally, one commenter admits it: Leonardo DiCaprio was in it, and therefore the imdb ratings for the movie were doomed.  I have been to a couple of chatrooms where these teenagers go on and on about their hatred for Leonardo DiCaprio. A very personal hatred, as if they know him. Now, go to the imdb vote break-down.  Notice that a very strange thing happens.  The most votes are 10's, then 9's, then 8's, etc.  Except that a very large number -- 10.7% of the voters -- gave it a 1 rating! Really, no matter how much fault anyone may find with the movie, it is by no means a 1! That's ridiculous.  And it is done by the DiCaprio haters, in order to sink the overall rating of the movie (which, at 7.0, still isn't bad, and can you imagine how much higher it would be if the 10.7% voted with their heads and not their hate-filled hearts?). Oh yes, I know that some of you will say that James Cameron's script wasn't that good, or that he got some details wrong, blah, blah, blah. But the 10.7% is all about Leo -- nothing to do with Cameron or reality.Just to let you know:  I am a 60-year-old man, and I found the movie 'Titanic' to be one of the most touching and spectacular that I have ever seen.  I love it! I have seen it multiple times, and the final scene of the lovers in the ocean makes me tear up every time. As for DiCaprio, he has a bad reputation for his temperment, as does Russell Crowe and many others, but DiCaprio's acting has always been first rate, and 'Titanic' is no exception.  Just see 'This Boy's Life' and 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape?' -- no second rate actor can do what he did in these films. 
In short, let's not count on imdb voters as a guide for the upcoming 'Gangs of New York'.  No doubt, the Leo-haters will be out in force, dragging down its ratings, too.One question to the 10.7%:  What horrible thing did this guy DiCaprio do to you personally?",10,0,3,2 September 2002
To Kill a Mockingbird," Brings tears to my eyes
","Every once in a while, there is a movie that successfully brings tears to my eyes, no matter how often I watch it.  To Kill a Mockingbird is at the top of that list. The scenes of Scout being shown by Atticus what she will inherit when he dies, of Scout finally meeting Boo Radley, and most of all, that most important journey through the woods by Scout and Jem -- these are the key tearjerker moments for me.(COMMENT: I have read many of the previous comments.  As with so many other movies, I am tired of hearing comparisons to the novel.  You simply cannot do in a movie what you can in a novel, and conversely, you cannot accomplish in a novel what you can in a movie.  This film is so intense, so innovative in cinematography, acting and music, and you simply could not get that out of the novel.  That's why there are novels and that's why there are movies. It's a different experience! I recall people complaining about how major plot elements from the novels Dr. Zhivago and East of Eden were left out of the movie versions.  Well, duh! Look at the sizes of those novels!  There is no way you can cover it all in a theatre!  You must choose what is most important to the main theme, and go with that.  This is what happened in To Kill a Mockingbird, the movie.  You do know, by the way, that Harper Lee loved the movie, don't you?)I remember the first time I showed the video to my youngest son and his best friend.  They were about Jem's age.  They were literally transfixed.  They were glued to the screen.  One of the elements that helps keep us so emotionally caught up in the viewing of the film is Elmer Bernstein's exceptional soundtrack. Then, there's the opening credits set inside the cigar box full of childhood toys, possibly the most original I have ever seen, and definitely a brief commentary on Boo Radley's childhood and on the loss of innocence. 
The theme of innocence is so integral to this film.  Boo is innocent.  Tom Robinson is innocent.  Scout and Jem are innocent now, but we realize that someday, they could be like all their bigoted neighbors...except for the superb example their father is showing them.  Atticus Finch is indeed one of the outstanding heros of American film.  What he does is not much in the grand scheme of things, but he puts his neck out for an innocent black man, knowing the consequences of his actions.  And yes, there are awful consequences.  This is his heritage to his children. You know they will be like him some day.   I appreciate knowing that the character of Dill was based upon Truman Capote as a young child, as this was a semi-autobiographical novel by Harper Lee, who knew Capote.  This helps us understand Capote a lot more. 
This movie is a masterpiece.  It moves me, and I take it that it moves many others.  (By the way, I have a new CD of the soundtrack by Elmer Bernstein, re-recorded and with the orchestra directed by Mr. Bernstein.  I highly recommend it.  It goes from sweet and lovely to downright frightening. If you've seen the movie at least twice, you can follow the story just by hearing the music.)",10,3,6,27 May 2000
Amélie," Cotton Candy, not the real stuff
","I cannot understand why so many users are raving about this film.  Yes, it is original.  Yes, the lead actress is cute and holds your attention. Yes, the other characters are bizarre and sometimes funny. But REALLY !!!! This is one of the highest rated films on imdb?  I have been a movie geek for almost 50 years, and this did NOT even remotely jump out at me as an all-time great film.  It is enjoyable fluff, nothing more.  Did it make me feel good about life?  No. I already was OK when I watched it, and it didn't move me, touch me in any real way. I expected so much more, from all the reviews.  I was disappointed.It is like cotton candy as opposed to homemade chocolate.  French cinema has produced much better than this.  Jules & Jim, Z, 400 Blows, Manon of the Spring, to name a few.",6,24,43,17 August 2002
