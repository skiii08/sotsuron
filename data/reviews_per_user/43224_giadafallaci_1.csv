Child 44," Enjoyable movie, glimpses of the Stalin era. It should have been fantastic considering the actors!
","I was looking forward to see this movie and I watched it on my Amazon Prime account. It was an interesting movie with quite a a bit of potential. I enjoyed the acting of the main characters and even though the so called Russian accent was bad, it added something to the movie. There was quite a line up of actors and the acting was very decent. But throughout the movie the accents started bothering me. The accents ofthe main characters were so thick, it became annoying. It distracted me from the movie, which was a shame. I enjoyed the story and the development of the story and characters. The story was interesting enough to want to see the whole movie even though I was disappointed that we were not given more explanation on the killer. It felt rather rushed. Did I enjoy it? Yes, it was good enough for a lazy Sunday afternoon. Do I recommend it? Yes, it was decent, enjoyable and interesting to get a bit of feeling of the Stalin era, way of living and politics. It's worth to watch.",7,0,1,17 January 2016
