Blade Runner 2049," Another Sequel that was Over-hyped
","The film was a solid six and maybe a 6.5 But why we have to have sequels that rely on big names and trying to use the things that made the first movie unique. I think was a good movie but as good as Blade Runner? Oh hell no! I'm not a big Gosselin fan but he was good in it and Harrison Ford gave one of his best performances he has had in some time. Being scifi there of course had to have a gorgeous female character, Ana de Armas more that made up for any deficiencies in any other casting weaknesses. She was absolutely captivating as was Sean Young in the original. I believe it could have been much better with some editing that could have shortened the all too long film. Much of the film was visually stunning and the sound track was good. The sound track seemed as if it was more directed to older people like me (I'm 62) Would I spend the money again to see it? Yup even at a 6.5 it was definitely worth a visit to the big screen.",6,10,24,6 October 2017
Deadpool 2," All I wanted was a sequel that was not a disappointment. I got so much more!
","If you like the character Deadpool then you'll like the movie. There was so much to like and laugh at. There were no slow spots. The action was great. There were really fun suprises. So many marvel movies have a plot without any interesting twists, this was not one of them. I especially enjoyed seeing side characters change over time. Do yourself a favor and go see a movie that was throughly enjoyable. Even with Reynolds who makes fun of his acting skills. He had some moving moments in the film. Something I didn't expect to see from a guy that looks like an avocado.",10,6,14,1 June 2018
