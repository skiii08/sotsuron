Scarface," at what prize do you get the money
","this movie is a MASTERPIECE,is one of the great films on show the audience how not to live your life.there is a lot of people like tony montana in real live,but they use that character for the easy way,that drive,determination, will to be successful it is not focused in the right way.AL PACINO is unbelievable i can't understand how he did not get nominated at least for an oscar.STEVEN BAUER is terrific the only sad thing is that he never could shake loose of this character.",8,0,1,16 July 1999
