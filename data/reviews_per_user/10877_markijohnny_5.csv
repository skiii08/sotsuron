Ford v Ferrari," What a movie!!
","This is what cinema is supposed to be, simply fun. You have beautiful cinematography, great acting, a ridiculous sense of speed and danger during the races, accentuated by some great music, an emotional story... I could go on, but most of it is really positive. It drags a bit by the end, and the main 'bad guy' is a bit exaggarated, he's there just to be bad, no motive or characterization, but hey, i really hated him. All in all a very pleasant surprise, i was biting my nails the whole time.",9,1,2,18 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Just a bad movie
","Not just a bad Star Wars movie, a bad movie in general. Completely devoid of any logic, no explaination for some very important stuff... things mostly just happen because it's convenient for the story to happen that way. They were so busy with bringing back ALL these characters that they forgot to give some character to the ones they have (except for maybe Poe and Kylo Ren). It is very clear that these movies were made by two directors who had completely different visions of what the movies should be, or Abrams just didn't have a lot of control over the movie and had to satisfy some committee when doing the movie. Oh and my god if Finn isn't one of the most irritating characters of the decade or so, i'm not sure if it's the way he was written or John Boyega's delivery, but every time he appeared on the screen i wanted to punch him. The movie's pretty to look at, and there's some interesting scenes near the end, but that's mostly it... Just lazy, cash grabbing filmmaking, no love or passion for the franchise",4,4,12,20 December 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Great acting, beautiful cinematography, and very boring
","Literally 2 hours and 35 minutes of nothing, and then 5 minutes of fun. Tarantino movies tend to be slow paced, but usually the dialogue is interesting, fun, suspenseful, this has none of that, just a bunch of boring scenes, whose only purpose was to fill the run time. I have a feeling that people give it great scores because by now it is expected for a tarantino movie to be great, but this one is not...",5,10,14,15 August 2019
1917," A great movie, just a little improbable for my taste
","The first third of the movie was brilliant, had it stayed on that level the whole movie it would be perfect, It was tense, beautifully shot, and had just the right amount of emotion. However, somewhere in the second third, the movie succumbs to some traditional hollywood problems - our hero becomes almost invincible, some scenes overly sentimental, and there are some obvious plot holes. Mendes should've toned down this part and it would've been perfect. The last part is still a bit overly sentimental, but overall the movie ends on a high note. As i said it really is a great movie, but it has it's problems that took away a bit from the overall experience. The cinematography is gorgeous though, at some parts it almost makes the war seem a bit too beautiful.",7,0,1,11 January 2020
Joker," A pretentious, and boring movie
","The movie takes itself too seriously, wants to seem smarter than it really is, and for the most part is really boring. Phoenix's performance is probably good but I couldn't really get into it because i wasn't enjoying the rest of the movie. Oh and the laughter is really annoying, I get what they were trying to achieve with the mental illness thing but, wasn't for me... there were 5 of us watching the movie, 3 of us thought it was pretty bad, the other two really
enjoyed it, i guess it's one of those movies...",5,13,36,4 October 2019
