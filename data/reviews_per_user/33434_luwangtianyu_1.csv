Conquest 1453," Arrogant and great distortion of history
","The invasion and conquer by brutal force is not something could be pride of. The Ottomans did not bring religious freedom or happiness to the conquered regions. Although the disasters they brought is not as huge as the Crusaders, it is a history of hatred and cruelty. This actually is against the basic ideas of Islam. It is always those who claim be believers actually act against the original creed. Even on the military side, it is not a great victory that using more than 10000 soldiers to capture a city defended by less than 10000 man. All those young people killed in those combat only added 'glory' of their rulers. Please do not glorify those unholy wars again. Young people's mind could be easily distorted by those propaganda style film. Human beings should live together peacefully.",2,25,47,30 September 2012
