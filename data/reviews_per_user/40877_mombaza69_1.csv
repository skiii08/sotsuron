The Rock," Superb film. A personal favorite of mine!
",An all out action film with lots to enjoy about it. Ed Harris puts in the best performance of his life. A very good plot with good classic film lines. Sean Connery and Nic Cage work well together with humour along the way. Some of the co-stars in the film are outstanding.,9,4,4,4 May 2002
