The Blair Witch Project," Excellent movie
","This was a great flic. The astonishingly incredible acting and the filming in only 16mm and 8mm 'home video' film only added to the realism and placed you more 'in the movie' with the characters. Everything about the film, to the smallest little detail, was portrayed so realistically that one would never guess that this film was fiction. Without a doubt, the scariest movie I have ever seen.",Null,0,0,10 August 1999
