Requiem for a Dream," Emotionally Draining Eye Opener
","The movie industry has always had an obscure relationship with drugs. Originally being completely taboo, they are now a staple in many modern horrors and comedies. Where some films glamourise them such as the 'Stoner-Comedy' sub-genre, there are other films that really show the grittier, downward spiral that narcotics can easily take people down such as 'Less Than Zero' or 'Spun'.Having seen Darren Aronofsky's 'Requiem for a Dream' before, I knew what film I was going to be sitting through. There would be no settling down, and no entertainment. This isn't to say that it is not a great film but you really do feel emotionally drained after the viewing. It isn't a movie you watch prior to settling down to sleep but one that will haunt you for a time after the credits have rolled. The surreal parts emphasise occurrences superbly, going from a very limited dark colour palette in reality to vibrant, energetic colours in their hallucinogenic, vegetated state that enables you to see things from their perspective without making drugs seem alluring. Far from it. This is potentially one of the greats of anti-drug cinema.There is no way to really prepare yourself for such an experience. It is bleak straight from the opening scenes where Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) is introduced. Entering his own mother, Sara's (Ellen Burstyn) home, he takes her television to acquire money for a fix. All the while the cinematography really gives you a deeper insight into their tarnished relationship as there is a literal line drawn between the two characters, showing their actions and reactions.Harry plans on becoming a dealer of high quality drugs with Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) whilst Goldfarb slowly drags his girlfriend, Marion (Jennifer Connely) into the fire with him, promising her their dirty money would go towards her own store where she can sell her fashion designs but, with her history of drug-usage. She soon finds herself back in a predicament.The film takes place over three seasons; Summer, Autumn and Winter and each play out as an act, showing the escalating desperation as the four main individuals sink deeper into their troubles. Throughout Harry's ordeal with the heroin his mother is dealing with another form of addiction. After the loss of her husband she has become lonely and food and television have become her substitute for love. After a phone-call from a television station she is filled with false hope, entertaining the idea of her 15 minutes of fame. Determined to wear her once beloved red dress for her small-screen appearance, unknowingly, she turns to amphetamine and becomes increasingly reliant on it's effects.Much like seasons in reality, each act becomes darker earlier, cold in it's outlook. Frosty in it's reception. Each of the characters push past the point of no return, sacrificing love, health and happiness in their own selfish or vulnerable haze.It isn't just the acting or the content of the movie that pushes it above and beyond, it's the orchestral pieces by Clint Mansell that really capture the despair. I am unable to listen to his pieces, full of sorrow and foreboding. It has a confounding effect on the soul emphasising all that is occurring on screen. Without a doubt it is one of the most effective and provocative soundtracks I have experienced on film. As much as it is an essential watch. It's too taxing to watch regularly. However, it deserves pride of place in any DVD collection and I would implore everyone to give it at least one viewing in their life-time. A powerful and eye-opening view into an underworld that most people avoid in their life-times. It really is a challenging view.",9,1,2,9 September 2013
Se7en," A relentless tour through hell
","The origins of my love for cinema began when I started to discover many films similar to Se7en, ones that really provoke mass discussion long after seeing them. That overwhelming necessity to really explore the deeper meaning of the movie. They don't just aim to entertain, but to challenge opinions and push people to comprehend short-comings in society.When the young, cocksure Detective Mills (Brad Pitt) moves to the city hoping for a more thrilling line of police work, a string of murders are set in motion. He is consequently partnered with the diligent veteran, Detective Lieutenant Somerset (Morgan Freeman) to resolve the case, forcing them to put aside their differences to end the sequence of events, only to become pawns on a much larger board.Throughout the feature you get the feeling that these are two very different walks of life, the generational divide in their work methods are shown clearly. Whilst Somerset is cultured, world-weary and methodical, Mills is very impulsive and head strong, aiming to make an impression within the force yet not having the same determination when investigating. A montage shows Pitt's character is struggling to concentrate at home, meanwhile, his elder is shown pouring over books in a library, making reasonable headway with the case.This is no buddy-cop movie, it's unrelenting and brutal throughout. Although all the murders happen off-screen, the events are retold via the crime scene investigations and photographic evidence which enhance the aura of mystery around the killer, building up to the final chilling performance by Kevin Spacey as their very own John Doe. Blank of regret and emotion, he fits the performance perfectly as you can see the criminal exuding delight as the detectives are forced to pursue him through the grisly cat and mouse game.One of the ways that Fincher expresses how twisted the city-living can become is by the similarities between the characteristics of the 'insane' Doe and the disciplined Somerset. They act as two parallel examples of how someone can deal with a poor hand. Where the detective originally set out to better the world via law enforcement, using his intellect to prevent misconduct, John Doe executes a series of pre- meditated murders using his knowledge as a message to the masses. Their cynical outlook on how humanity has become so apathetic is resolved in two completely polar ways, their likeness fascinates me.I believe that part of David Fincher's plan when filming this was to hold a mirror to modern society. For us to scrutinise why, when murders are committed, we show no empathy? Horrors and tragedies are a staple fixture of the world today and much like Fincher's 'Fight Club' adaptation, it questions the very core of how compassion seems to have become less predominant, replaced by a love for money, consumerism and our own well-being. How accustomed we have become to awful events described by various media outlets on a a daily basis. All roles perfectly delivered by all actors involved. The ending flawlessly ties all loose ends within the plot whilst delivering its distressing climax, undoubtedly still provoking debates over a decade after its initial release.",9,1,2,20 March 2014
Lost in Translation," A heartwarming journey through Tokyo
","After a recent stint of horror films, 'Lost In Translation' was a delightful retreat from the bleakness of the dark recesses of the human mind as it explored the budding relationship between two strangers in Tokyo. With both of our main characters being at a standstill within their respective careers, it seems as though they are also in limbo between their past lifestyle and the ones that they would ideally like to lead.With the large age gap between Bob (Bill Murray) and the beautiful Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), poor acting could have easily been the downfall of the film. Regardless, Murray exudes his trademark charm flawlessly as you witness the budding relationship between the drifters. Without, the movie could have had an entirely different feeling as the wrong male lead could have come across as creepy or inappropriate.As you study how these characters are, you notice how bewildered they both seem by the overwhelming diversity of Japanese culture. The neglect they experience in various forms is perhaps enhanced by their isolation because of their lack of knowledge on the culture that they were immersed in. However, they find solace in each others company and this is when they dive in to the Japanese lifestyle and just embrace it.Life is fleeting; Sofia Coppola captures this message perfectly. It may seem clichéd but Bob and Charlotte spend all the of their time together just simply living. Their flair for life is infectious. It gives this wonderful sense of adventure and wanderlust, to explore everything the world has to offer with the most wonderful company. A truly beautiful, heartfelt film that is exceptional due to the strong performances of the leads.",9,0,0,19 April 2014
We're the Millers," From Friends, to family
","After watching 'We're the Millers', I came to the realisation that Jennifer Aniston has had the most success out of the main cast of popular 90′s show 'Friends' after it went off air in 2004. Whilst David Schwimmer directs and occasionally lends his voice to animations such as 'Madagascar', most have rarely been on the big-screen since, perhaps peaking with the sit- com.Whilst Aniston never veers far from her portrayal as Rachael when acting in most roles, it seems to have been a winning formula for her as she stars in a mixture of romantic comedies. In terms of putting aces in places, 'We're the Millers' excels at placing their actors as characters best suited to them which really helps pack the humour with an extra punch.When local pot dealer, Dave (Jason Sudeikis), is robbed of his drug dealers money and stash he finds himself forced by his boss to smuggle a 'smidgen' of weed across the Mexican border with a family he assembled, as compensation, purposefully finding people to fit every family stereotype. The teenage girl with an attitude (Emma Roberts), the awkward son (Will Poulter) and the loved up wife (Aniston). Their motives for joining his escapades vary from being an out of luck stripper to a runaway child. Soon, things get out of control as they jump in a recreational vehicle, leaving a trail of madness in their wake. Along the way they are pursued by a drug cartel and meet a family of three who they repeatedly cross paths with.The film reminded me of a more adult re-imagining of the 2006 Robin Williams outing, 'R.V' and whilst the Williams movie was based around him trying to bring his family closer together again this road trip was more of a personal journey for all involved in this film. Although it was obvious where the plot would go in the sense of the protagonist being a single, lonely drug dealer finding his missing link, the journey throughout was light and, at times, sentimental yet not overbearingly so as it kept the gags rolling thick and fast.Despite Ed Helms being popular due to his recent achievements in 'The Hangover' trilogy I couldn't help but imagine Bob Odenkirk of Breaking Bad fame (Better Call Saul!) being the most ideal match for the part of Brad Gurdlinger. Maybe this is just down to my current addiction to that specific series yet Helms still performs well as the dirty drug dealer.Additionally, the sporadic use of many references to popular television and films help to elevate the humour such as mentions to 'Dexter' and Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight Rises', both immensely prominent in their respective mediums.Regardless of the fact that some of the wisecracks are predictable. Some are pleasantly unanticipated as the family find themselves in odd situations that have laughable, unexpected resolutions including a scene where Aniston proves she's 'still got it'. Considering I went in with no preconceptions, I came out of the cinema content that I'd given this film the chance it undoubtedly deserved as it's truly one of the best comedic offerings of the year.",6,0,1,16 September 2013
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Although better, still room for improvement
","The internal debate. When disappointed by the initial instalment of a trilogy, do you bite the bullet and give the second part a chance or steer clear to avoid further upset? I believe that in most cases, if you truly strive to enjoy a series then the former seems the obvious choice. Going in with poor expectations occasionally causes the viewer to dissect the following film. On another occasion, the bar is set so low that you are unable to be anything other than pleasantly surprised.When The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was released, I left my local multiplex completely underwhelmed. With almost a decade between The Return of the King and the initial prequel, I contemplated whether my tastes had simply changed in the passing time. Prior to Middle Earths resurgence on the big screen, HBO made a sizeable impact on the small screen with Game Of Thrones which offered a darker, more adult alternative to the fantasy epic genre. Where Jackson's envisioning of Tolkien's Middle Earth were condensed into three hour films, the television adaption of George R.R Martin's book saga was debuted weekly, allowing a higher threshold of character development without glancing over certain plot points.Regardless of these factors, surely the familiarity of such beautiful compositions as 'Concerning Hobbits' should have rekindled my past love for the franchise in those opening moments? It did, however the remainder of the film felt much different. Whilst the soundtrack felt familiar, including the new addition of the song of the 'Misty Mountains', the overall tone never seemed to reach a consistent note. Personally, it felt more akin to The Chronicles of Narnia adaptions than the previous Lord of the Rings trilogy with it's needless use of child orientated humour. Additionally, the creatures seemed to be heavily influenced by the input of Guillermo Del Toro with the Orcs taking a slightly contrasting appearance. Their presence moved further away from the more menacing, prosthetics based entities I had come to both respect and fear in my youth to a more CGI centric being.The Desolation of Smaug is a much leaner, more refined continuation of the Hobbit storyline. Having already established all of the characters, the momentum is able to build at a faster pace without repeated introductions, moving swiftly between each set piece,from a conflict with a cluster of giant spiders to the groundbreaking encounter with the dragon, Smaug which showcases some of the finest CGI I have seen. On the contrary I felt that, excluding these two action sequences, the remainder of the effects were rather flawed as though they had spent all of their efforts on those key scenes. The rest of the film is weighed down by a comparatively horrendous usage of green-screens which will accelerate the ageing of the instalment in years to come.Nevertheless, a balance between action and the progression of the cast seems out of reach. Perhaps prolonging the length of one book into a trilogy is the root of this problem with a limited amount of plot to cover. Some conflicts seem to border on filler and I felt there was a lack of conversation on some part amidst the hordes of Orcs although it did distinguish more defined combat styles. The Mongol-esque dismemberment of a spider by the Dwarfs and the graceful, honed battle skills of the Elves as they seemingly dance between their foes. The camaraderie feels less apparent than in the first trilogy and the lack of any fatalities to the company removes you from the same sense of danger that previous instalments emitted with Legolas or Tauriel rescuing our protagonists from any impending tragedies.Overall it was an enjoyable film, I just deem it lacks some of what I once felt was a more substantial part of the franchise and the essence of The Lord of the Rings; such as the emphasis on friendship and the adventurers persevering through hardships. On the other hand it did capture the undertone of how overpowering desires and obsessions can really contribute to someone's downfall. Despite some of the negativity within this review this sequel was a vast improvement full of excitement and ambition ensuring that it leaves viewers craving the conclusion to the Unexpected Journey.",7,2,2,20 March 2014
Good Will Hunting," A View Into The Mind Of A Genius
","In the past few weeks, one man alone has succeeded in dividing and provoking opinions from across the internet in the most significant entertainment news of the past seven days. Ben Affleck was announced to be picking up the Cowl and continuing the cinematic legacy of the Batman. With Christian Bales performance of the caped crusader still fresh in everyones minds, many are unwilling to give Affleck the chance to prove himself. It was at this point that I decided to revisit several of his different roles from throughout his career in an attempt to come to a conclusion. The first of these films being the touching 'Good Will Hunting', co- written and starring both Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.When a series of difficult equations are solved by a university janitor, he is pursued by a professor after he is arrested following a street fight. Help comes from mysterious places as he is released on the grounds that he meets regularly with both a Therapist and the Professor in an attempt to help him realise his full potential.He goes through several therapists in quick succession as he outsmarts and analyses them prior to them being able to properly get to know him. This calls for Professor Gerard Lambeauto call upon his old college friend, Sean Maguire (Robin Williams). Both characters grew up in South Boston, which helps them to develop a connection that will test their limits.Will (Matt Damon) soon understands that he has met his intellectual equal and their meetings play out much like a game of chess. It's thrilling to watch them both trying to gain the upper hand only to constantly counter each other. Williams is such an accomplished actor, always perfecting the role of the caring teacher as Hunting desperately searches for a father figure after having a turbulent childhood. Realising this, Maguire opens up to share real life experience as the genius has limited himself so much, knowing only what he knows from literature and quotations to protect himself from the pain of losing people.All the characters have believable motivations for helping Will and it's good to see how they all approach it in different way. From the assertive, Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgård) who attempts to push the genius down various career paths to Sean, who tries to guide him to find his own path, understanding that Wills difficulties originate from the abuse and neglect that he experienced in his childhood.Although Affleck isn't in the lime-light throughout most of the movie there are several key scenes which really triumph in leaving a lasting impression on the viewer. With honourable mentions to his final, poignant scene. On the other hand, collaborating with Damon to create such an incredible script is a testament to their skill. Far from being a skeptic, this has really made me far more open to his take on the worlds greatest detective.The movie really tackles many issues as you see the darkness that some talented people can face on a daily basis and how his past overshadows his brilliance, preventing him from taking leaps towards a better life. It really is a film based on self discovery and the events that rekindle his intentions to push himself further in his existence begin as he comprehends how many people care for him. I'd recommend this film to anyone as it can really resonate with any viewer. Everyone will, at some point in their lives, question the path their life will lead and this really is an extreme example of this as he has ran himself into the ground over the years trying to find his direction only to rebuild his foundations and understand his potential.",10,1,4,9 September 2013
12 Years a Slave," A harrowing tale of redemption
","Movies aren't just a source of entertainment and escapism. They can educate the viewer on culture, the history of society and how it has developed to lead us to how we are today, depicting distant lands and the hardships that people have endured to ensure that others can lead a better lifestyle, history that we may not have come across otherwise. The film industry has the ability to hold a mirror to an audience, unapologetically delving into the unspeakable truths of our ancestors transgressions.All will know what to expect upon deciding to see 12 Years a Slave. The absence of basic human rights, the immorality and apathy that is a prevalent theme to many throughout it's run-time. When Solomon Northup, family man and professional violinist is wrongly uprooted from his life as a free man, he is forced to change or die. Leaving behind all identity he becomes Platt, forced to implement his skills in carpentry and music whilst later working in the cotton picking fields, all the while enduring constant physical and mental abuse. Fassbender's portrayal of a slaver may seem the films obvious antagonist however if you look deeper, you find not only more human flaws such as jealousy, but also other examples of compliance and blissful ignorance. Such is the role of Benedict Cumberbatch's, Ford. Whilst he was a man of the lord who respected his work force, he often overlooked the slander and abuse dealt out by his overseers. Although he had no hand in this abuse, I believe his acceptance for how things were was just as deplorable as he was too weak to challenge the status-quo.TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE (Photo: Jaap Buitendijk/FOX Searchlight)Gifted for his time with Ford, Solomon receives a Violin. Throughout his hellish existence in the Louisiana heat he finds it to be his only solace as he experiences the five stages of loss and grief; Denial and Isolation, Anger, Bargaining, Depression and Acceptance. Beat into submission, he experienced disturbing acts of cruelty until he broke, defending himself, leading to unwarranted ramifications as he is sent to work with the unforgiving, Epps.12 YEARS A SLAVENot only does 12 Years a Slave have an incredible cast of renowned actors, it also displays new talent. Fresh from drama school, Lupita Nyong'o brings a fresh face to the big screen as the troubled gem of Ebb's workforce, Patsy. Her début is a tour de force as she brings the performance into her own, avoiding being overshadowed by the A-list cast. A period film of this nature could potentially crumble if it has a weak link within, however I commend all involved for honest, poignant performances. My only small gripe was with Pitt's accent. Reminiscent of the Southern drawl of Lieutenant Aldo Raine in Inglourious Basterds, I struggled to take him too seriously as I constantly thought of the unconventional lead in Tarantino's quirky perspective of the World War.Regardless of all the sadness and brutality which this film purveys, it never ceases to show the beauty of the Virginian countryside. Shots of swamps and marshes teeming with insects and wildlife, cotton fields and woodland amidst the chirping of Crickets and the tweeting of birds all aid in immersing you in the experience.Throughout, it is an intense and relevant viewing, delving into the murky waters of our ancestral past. Underlining our wrongs whilst perhaps provoking discussion on how to avoid similar modern failures after the viewing, it stays no longer than it needs to yet it will endure with viewers for the foreseeable future.",9,1,4,20 March 2014
The Conjuring," Films still go bump in the night
","When a trailer pushes 'Based on a true story' as it's first selling point, prior to even showing footage, it always makes me very weary of the final product. Gone are the days where this is a major selling point for a film where I am concerned. It's an over-used marketing technique that can often keep the small-minded filling the seats. Although the film may well be based on a true story, if you look into it. It doesn't matter how vaguely it resembles the actual happenings. They can still use the term as long as they keep a slight connection such as names. Regardless, after having positive word of mouth ignored my doubts and went to see the film.The final product was completely dissimilar to the way it was portrayed in the trailer. It wasn't a documentary, but it also wasn't the standard exorcism film that I went in expecting it to be. It was a really pleasant surprise after seeing so many weak attempts in recent years as many people fail at achieving the greatness and controversy that films such as 'The Exorcist' produced.In 1971, the Perron family relocate to Rhode Island with their five daughters. When they come across a basement which had been concealed for a decade, they disturb many restless spirits and unmask a history of murders within the vicinity of their house. A series of outbreaks occur to them, leading them to contact leading investigators of the paranormal, Ed and Lorraine Warren to aid them in ending their torment. The house is found to be a congregation for the damned and an exorcism is vital if the family are to remain safe.'The Conjuring' really surpassed expectations as its scares, on the most part, were more suggestive instead of just opting for copious bloodshed. However, there were a considerable amount of moments which made the audience jump out of their seats. The cinema screening I went to seemed incredibly loud and it really added to the atmosphere as the music had such effective crescendos and really let the film get inside of your head.One of the most impressive buildups didn't even make the audience jump, instead, it makes you anticipate being frightened, only to then not deliver it. It misleads you to believe that the final shock will be predictable and then completely turns the table and it really felt like a final, cheeky wink.It also avoids the typical issues that exorcism films often fall for in that the exorcism scene doesn't drag out for too long. I find others can over-do it until the scene loses momentum and this was suitably short, but strong. I loved the claustrophobia and helplessness in the scene as well as there is an intense chase through the crawl space of their home. It's rather distressing as you really feel the helplessness of the family but it would have been much more sufficient if they had developed the daughters more as none of them are particularly distinguishable. None really feel that significant other than being a plot device and you don't have the chance to connect with them.It could have gone more in depth with the investigators home life as the doll excelled at creating an ambiance and putting the viewers on edge although they didn't really use it to it's full potential. I would have liked to have seen more although the relic room in the Warren house is a gold mine of potential sequels and/or prequels. I expected the doll to have more of a significance within the film but perhaps they will give it more attention in the sequel which has already been announced.Minor gripes aside this really is a film that is in its element when watched at the cinema as it aims straight for the jugular from it's opening scene until the credits roll, ensuring palms remain sweaty, along with heart rates as it keeps the thrills frequent. Whilst they could have expanded on some of the family life, the length of the film was adequate as it never ceases to keep the audiences attention.",8,0,1,9 September 2013
