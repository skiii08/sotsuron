Black Swan," Awful
","This is seriously a trashy film without any redeeming qualities. It's a perfect example of why Hollywood and movie-making globally needs more women producers, directors, writers and cinematographers.This movie badly masquerades as high art when it's nothing more than violent porn. It's so vile it's absolutely shocking to see how highly rated it is here on IMDb.The story is as absurd as a porn plot. The acting is bad except for (surprisingly) Mila Kunis. The cinematography is pathetic and simply makes the viewer more keenly aware that the choreography is bad and the dancing even worse.It's not Gothic horror. Nor is it a psychological thriller. It's nothing more than the narcissistic violent'male gaze' exploiting, degrading, raping and murdering women.For dance films, I recommend The Red Shoes, Swing Time, Turning Point, The Band Wagon, Top Hat, 42nd Street, Gold Diggers of 1933, Go Into Your Dance, An American in Paris, Singing in the Rain, Born to Dance, Broadway Melody of 1938, All That Jazz, Strictly Ballroom, Step Up, Cabaret, Dirty Dancing and the documentaries Baryshnikov: The Dancer and the Dance & Mad Hot Ballroom.",2,4,6,2 January 2017
To Be or Not to Be," Deft Delightful & Dangerously Hilarious Nazi Satire
","No one else but Ernst Lubitsch could have made To Be or Not to Be. That it's superb and sublime and witty and ingeniously funny cannot be emphasized enough. The film has a great script, direction and cinematography (Rudolph Mat√©).While the entire cast shines, Lombard and Benny are absolutely stellar. It's a shame that Benny did not get matched with similarly genius director post-TBONTB is a real shame because with the right director and script he could have gone on to be a film star. Perhaps the fact that much of the story takes place in a theatre and then on the many theatre troupe's 'stages' as they foil the Nazis throughout the story, nurtured Benny's own natural unique comedic talent in a way that his other films could not.And then there's Lombard. Carole Lombard was and still is imho, the best comedic actor other than Chaplin-Lloyd-Keaton-Dressler-Stanwyck. I don't find that the comedians of today can even come close to the previously mentioned comedians. Lombard and Benny play the most perfectly narcissistic clever power-couple seen anywhere in film or real life. That this was Lomabrd's final film before her tragic death (plane crash during a war bond tour) is sad for all of us. Her seduction of the dashing young Robert Stack's Lt. Sobinski and the evil double-agent, Professor Siletski (Stanley Ridges)is wonderful to watch. The petty banter between the egomaniacal husband and wife acting team, the Turas (Lombard and Benny) is equally delightful. Also worth mentioning is Lombard's maid, Anna (Maude Eburne) who has some great lines like, 'What a husband doesn't know won't hurt his wife.' While audiences in 1941/42 may not have been able to appreciate this satire,it's worth noting that Roberto Benigni's film Life Is Beautiful (which has a higher IMDb rating) was also criticized for mixing humor in a story about the holocaust when screened at Cannes in 1997. Some people were outraged that Benigni would include comedy in the concentration camp scenes. But the film went on to win several top awards. Another film which comes to mind mixing war/genocide with comedy in a very skillful way is Arthur Penn's, Little Big Man (1970-based on a novel of the same name by Thomas Berger). I don't know if there were any criticisms of comedy being used in a movie about the genocide of Native Americans but in my opinion, Little Big Man, although a different style than TBONTB, is a superior comedy about a very serious and tragic time in America's history.I believe these knee jerk reactions to films which show or allude to barbaric shameful historic events are without merit. For it's art which brings light to not only these man-made horrors but illuminates the beauty and power of the human spirit.Lubitsch's To Be or Not to Be should not be over-looked. It's one of the finest examples of comedy from any era. Plus you get to watch Lombard and Benny at their most sublime.",10,1,3,30 December 2012
Crash," Trash & Burn: Or how I learned how NOT to make a movie
","This is by far one of the very worst movies I've ever had the displeasure to view. It was so bad I was laughing out loud during scenes which the awful writer-director (Welles he definitely ain't & never will be) I'm certain believed would be 'thought provoking', or 'heart breaking gritty realism'. It's so very badly written, acted, edited, shot but somehow (amazingly!) somehow this manipulative- pretentious-after-school-special (actually that's insulting to millions of students) got nomination after nomination. I can only imagine that cleverly marketed to the do-gooders of the Hollywood out-of-touch- elite (Please Google George Clooney's acceptance speech where he makes ridiculous comments like 'Hollywood has always been ahead of the curve.' And he reminded us that Hollywood was progressive enough back in the so-called Golden Era of H-Wood to give a black actor an Oscar....eh hmmm....it is for these types of 'petite' racist morons that Crash was made).If you're even a little aware of American culture please don't bother with this 'film' (for lack of a better name). You would do much better watching TCM's specials on African American Films from the Golden Age to current times. Or their more recent month long subject of Asian Images in Hollywood than to throw your money away on this insulting piece of filth.It's not even offensive to me the 'how's' of 'how' this crap got made. Misogyny is popular with producers and studio heads and these same important men like to feel as of what they do in Hollywood trickles down to us mere mortals like manna from heaven. These important men like to believe that Hollywood is still relevant as far as social issues and changing times (which we all know hasn't really been the case since the great American cinema of the 70's). These important men also love paying 'homage' to other films. As others have noted Haggis lifts scenes and ideas directly from earlier films like Pulp Fiction and Magnolia. Truly the mark of someone who isn't very talented.Although I admit it annoys me terribly that lots of money gets thrown into such bad projects like 'Crash'. What is really insulting and offensive is that there are good filmmakers making beautiful and important films and their work was over- looked so that this piece of idiotshiot could get oodles of nominations (I think it even won a bunch - too depressing for me to look up).Oh and Academy - please stop trying to bewitch me! Matt Dillon can NOT act. He's a terrible actor & us mere mortals know it! He is to acting what Haggis is to directing/writing. Quick note on Haggis: He's a Canadian whose lived in Los Angeles for over 20 years of his adult life and this was his portrayal of Los Angelenos and 'realistic' dialogue? No one anywhere out of their Race in America 101 college class is this idiotic and pretentious. Crash is simply trash.",Null,12,18,25 July 2008
Zero Dark Thirty," Poopaganda
","This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It amazes me that it received so many accolades. I'm just over-joyed I didn't pay $15 to see it in the theatre. This movie is bad acting by good, even great actors (I believe this has to do with bad directing); poor laughable script (no one researched anything about the various cultures being dealt with in this film) - Pakastanis speak Arabic - really? All males in the middle east wear turbans - really?; bad script without any character development - absolutely no background on any characters......no story arc - there's no change, no transformation-redemption-acknowledgment of deeper understanding.......NOTHING. The script is as empty as Jessica Chastain's meant-to-be-hard-ass-meaningful-empty-robot gaze. The editing is a mess - it's unbelievable to me that this is a Hollywood production?! Scenes go absolutely no where. Worst editing and I believe this movie was nominated for Best Editing? How is that possible?! The score(music)and cinematography are equally boring like everything else.This movie is a shill for the United States. Looks and feels like it was hurriedly made without any conscious effort to truly tell the story they (director, screenwriter and producers) claim they are exposing. They're(director, screenwriter and producers)nothing more than shady carnival barkers shouting about how great and powerful the all-knowing all-seeing United States is but like the Wizard of Oz there is nothing behind the curtain, or in this case film.",Null,3,8,27 December 2013
