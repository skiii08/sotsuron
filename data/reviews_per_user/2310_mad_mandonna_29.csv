The Avengers," A great summer film. Is it more than that, sorry Joss, no it's not.
","The Avengers is not as good as The Dark Knight, I'm just going to say that from the off, the storyline is escapism and it has some genuinely funny moments in it, but it doesn't have the deep characters or visual spectacle. Joss Whedon's script keeps the film going, and lets be honest, this film could have been a train wreck. What makes The Avengers tick is the relationships that each of the characters have with one another. This is where the film really takes flight, when all the characters are in a pressure cooker together, it gives the film weight and suspense especially with Mark Ruffalo's Hulk. Joss Whedon should be given a lot of credit for crafting such a cohesive and well thought out script.The Dialogue is what keeps it above board, visuals have never been Joss Whedon's strong suit, but I did notice a wink to his first feature film Serenity in zoom shots in the action sequences (see Serenity's finale as the ship falls from the sky). The film doesn't look bad by any means it just has the same sheen that the other Marvel films seem to support, but it didn't really have a choice following suit from its predecessors. But lack of visual flair is sometimes what makes me dislike these movies, they look too clean and have a sheen that makes it look too much like a cartoon for my personal taste. Other Superhero film don't seem to have this 'sheen', making them more visually pleasing to me - the Nolan and Burton Batman's spring to mind as well as the Marvel Xmen films.The film works equally as well in 2D as it does in 3D, the 'third' dimension is not needed here, the visual storytelling (though nothing groundbreaking) stands on its own two feet, making the 3D gimmick unnecessary. Its very difficult to score this film as it is by and large a fantastic superhero film, thats enjoyable from beginning to end. But enjoyment isn't all I mark it on, was the story original, well no not at all, it was an accumulation of its heroes solo films. Were the visuals good, yes, but they weren't anything you haven't seen in other similar films. The Avengers is fun and Joss's ingenious and humorous dialogue will make you come back for another sitting, but by and large this isn't a anything more than a summer popcorn film, not that it tries to be more either. But what do I know I gave Salt a 9.",7,3,10,4 May 2012
Black Swan," A rare and precious gem of a film, Nalatlie Portman is a knock out.
","Natalie Portman is a knock out in this film. She embraces it with every single ounce of her being, its a subdued performance at times, but one where she manages to get every audience member to feel for her. Not an easy task, but she takes to it like a duck (or swan) to water. The direction here is truly beautiful, though in full colour it feels at time that it could be in monochrome, it truly gives a seediness to the world its presented here.Despite being a film based upon ballet, it is more character driven that anything else, though the main premise of the film might be put off by Black Swan this would be truly stupid thing as it really is good enough to appeal to a broad range of people.Though it is Natalie Portman that leads this film with guns a blazing, other significant women in this film stick out. Mila Kunis's bad girl plays off against Portman brilliantly and the two form an unexpected and mysterious friendship. Barbara Hershey works well as the mother, who plays every second of the film with malevolence with what seems to be delight.Winona Ryder takes what little she is given and turns it to gold.Black Swan is a power house of stunning direction and an ensemble of great performances. A film I literally cannot recommend any higher.",9,2,3,26 July 2011
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," A letter to Stephanie Meyer
","Dear Stephanie Meyer,You Ripped off Buffy the vampire slayer and Southern Vampire Mysteries and have been far too successful with it.This films pacing is off, acting is wooden and there is no humour except for the terribly written dialogue and ugly unconvincing CGI. Bella is barely a character and more of cardboard cut out, who really isn't a very good example to young women. This girl is badly harmed after having sex with her husband, but its OK cause he didn't mean to do it. That's very reminiscent of what a lot of women in physically abusive relationships say. It may be fantasy, but teenagers and younger are heavily influenced by what they read and watch so I'm gonna ask Stephanie Meyer.... Can you either stop writing books OR have Buffy (you already stole the characters romance why not the whole character) and have an empowering woman that teens can look up to and not feel repressed by her male counter parts. Thanks Jay Johnson",2,14,29,18 November 2011
Batman Returns," An extremely ambitious, greatly directed superhero movie
","Tim Burton the man behind the original Batman film and Beetlejuice, brings the world the sequel to Batman, that exceeds the original in more ways than one. Firstly Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny De Vito are a great mix of Batmans enemies. The dark, deadly and sexy Catwoman works well to rattle some heads within the story and penguin works in the same way that the joker worked in the original. The sets are stunning and immaculate. Gotham city has so many dark alleyways that you could never know what's happening at one time or another. The only thing that gives it a bad name is its script, which at times seems to lapse and then not recover for while. Tim Burtons direction bring superhero films into a new realm. Beats all the superman films and the other Batman films by a mile. Though in terms of realisation the new Batman begins has a bite where this one lacks, but Burton is a more original director than Nolan.*First review written by me at 16. Re-written at 21*Tim Burton has an interesting history in film, between the surreal Pee Wee's Big Adventure and mis-interpreted Alice in Wonderland, Tim Burton's career has gone from an artistic darkly comic director, to unimaginative copy-cat of his own work. I still stand by my original review in that this film is very cleverly directed, beautifully shot, with stunning towering set pieces, but a script that goes from cheesy melodrama, to cheap and nasty humour. Though with some terribly written scenes there are some, incredible ones. Mainly those concerning antagonists Catwoman and Penguin. One scene in particular concerning the two concocting a frivolous ploy to destroy batman is one that springs to mind. The acting is first class, Danny DeVito is deliciously theatrical and sinister, Michelle Pfeiffer relentlessly sexy and smooth. Since my original review Dark Knight was released. Unfortunately for Burton I retract my youthful statement of his originality over Nolan. Dark Knight surpasses Batman Returns and almost eclipses its existence, but this instalment still has great merit and will stand out as one of the greatest superhero films, not to mention cementing Batman as the greatest superhero franchise ever.",9,93,190,10 June 2005
Alien," Classic horror, classic sci fi, classic film
","Alien is truly a work of art. Ridley Scott hand carved this monster in space epic from almost nothing, a fairly limp script and a budget that required some imagination. Scott delivered on every front and made this classic that I believe will live on well after Hollywood does a shoddy remake of it.The manages suspense like no other, its music is so haunting and mellow that it murmurs beneath the surface until its ready to pounce. The pace is uncomfortable speed, in its first half very little happens and though it doesn't drag it pulls you along giving you just enough interest to keep you attached, but keeping the audience at an arms length to make u feel like you are a peeping tom, all the more creepy. The famous chest bursting sequence is where the film really kicks off and literally drives into a speed at which is relentless and horrifying.The scenery in the film is just stunning. From Gigers towering and disturbing Alien set pieces to claustrophobic nostromo. Every inch of the film is thought through superbly, the scenery and the lighting and the music compliment every aspect as the film goes on. Sigourney Weaver is nothing short of amazing, her first major role was one that she would be remembered for forever. Ripley is the quintessential female action hero, a tough as nails captain that displays a ferocious side, but at the same time has a warmth and nurturing aspect that makes her oh so likable.Alien's four sequels (I'm excluding Alien Vs Predator)all attempt a new take on the original film. The sequel Aliens captures something new, but retains the same feel of the original. Some argue it as better than Alien, but I disagree, Alien is unbelievably refined and well done, whereas Aliens offers a staggering action caper with a great weighted drama as well. Alien 3 is the major miss step in the franchise, but it still has some merit. And Alien: Resurrection tries something new and half achieves its goal, but I can't help thinking they could have gone further with it.Alien is incredible, a classic film that all should see. And though not to everyones taste it is undeniable that this film has stood the test of time because its so damn good.",10,0,1,21 April 2011
Horrible Bosses," An often amusing and fun comedy, that with a bit more spark could have been hilarious
","We've all had them, haven't we that man or woman you despise in a position of power over you despite the fact they may not deserve that power. We all know or know of someone who abuses that little sprinkle of power that they have. I personally have worked in catering all my adult and half my teen-aged life, and that particular industry has those types of people in spades, even when you do everything in your power to please them, its still not enough! Ever fantasised about throwing said person out of a window, I know I have. I could just have a sick sense of humour that others may not share, but I generally have hated a lot of my bosses. So in comes Horrible Bosses, a film that promises to fore fill that immoral fantasy we cannot undertake.The promise is made, but unsurprisingly not kept. The Villains of the piece include Kevin Spacey's CEO of a major company, that tortures his employee's like a playground bully. We also have Colin Farrells, coke snorting, spoilt brat wannabe playboy who inherits his fathers company with no intention of upholding it's values. And Finally Jennifer Anistons nymphomaniac dentist, with a rather ridiculous obsession with her dental assistant. The bosses are delightfully horrible, Jennifer Anistons in particularly nasty and you can easily see why the employee's would want to off these particular human beings.Now the premise is here, it works for the most part and the bosses are in place. But now you need your employee's and I believe this is where the stumbling block may have been. They three male leads are funny and do have great moments , but there all one piece of the same puzzle. Variety is the spice of life so they say and more varied characters would have made this all the enjoyable. Having a female or a homosexual or an ethnic minority I believe would have been funnier. Jennifer Aniston coming on to her gay assistant as opposed to her straight one would have been far more entertaining and unexpected. Thats my own thought anyway, and many of the ethnic stereotypes in Horrible Bosses come across as a little crass.There some rather brilliant bits, two of the employee's getting high off cocaine dust is brilliant and the bosses seem to have a lot of fun here. Of the R rated films I've seen this year Horrible Bosses manages to come off somewhere in the middle, better than The Hangover: Part 2, but not quite as good as Bridesmaids. Its most comparable film is probably Bad Teacher, in that both films took some jokes too far while others didn't go far enough. I think with a smarter plot the film could have been wittier and more exciting, it manages to stagger on the line of entertaining without really stretching the audience in any way.Its a risk free comedy, that doesn't live up to the premise. There is much to enjoyed here, but generally this is a middle of the road comedy that had way more potential.",6,0,0,26 July 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Surprisingly impressed
","I love the books. I like the films. They're watchable at best. Philosophers Stone and Chamber Of Secrets were faithful though lacked any particular style and fell in with most generic early noughties fantasy films. Prisoner Of Azkaban took a more stylistic approach and managed to capture a medieval look. The Goblet Of fire (the first of the big ones) in my opinion was utter shambles. The acting was inferior to the others, the style seemed to attempt to copy its predecessor with little success and the comedy was forced, staged and unfunny. Order Of the Pheonix tried to cram a lot of story into a short space of time. Clever ideas and directorial sharpness kept it from falling the way Goblet had. Though Yates had much to celebrate with Order of the Pheonix, Halfblood prince seemed to skim the book leaving gaping holes in a pretty simplistic plot. The romance between Potter and Ginny Weasley was hopelessly unengaging and both actors lacked any chemistry.This film is probably the most faithful to the books. The books narrative is the final installment is written like it should be translated to film, so the cross over shouldn't have been as hard as the others. Being in two halves was definitely the correct approach though the end of this film annoyed me some what. I know the ending, but I am now desperate to see the next one. To me thats job well done to director David Yates, his third of four Potter films. The action is well timed, the horror is just enough to make adult feel a slight amount of dredd, and may only give kids nightmare for a day or two, which in opinion is a good thing. The 'adult' cast once again tower over the teens, but with less screen time for the 'adults' the teens are not dwarfed like in previous installments. The film though grim and gritty, is beautifully shot cinematography is superb once again and the special effects are amazing to say the least.I was really not holding out much hope for Deathly Hallows part 1, but I was pleasantly surprised. Virtually anyone who has watched the others will go see this one, but rest assured to those that are let down by the films as I have been time after time, this one could well be the best outing. Bring on part 2.",8,1,2,20 November 2010
Little Miss Sunshine," This sun really does shine.
","The title is very miss leading, but the film itself is truly fantastic. A very sweet comedy that is in no way offensive, or misleading it's all done with a smile and it has a very satisfying ending. The acting and chemistry between the characters is what keeps the film going at a splendid pace and it also manages to keep the audience keen. The films comedy is warm and never grotesque, even with some slightly interesting subject matters it maintains a dignity that, I personally think has been lost in comedy for a long time. In terms of scripting the film really excels and quite rightly it now has an Oscar to match its truly memorable writing. The director, though not doing anything we haven't seen before, manages to make some scenes really memorable, especially at the point in the film when the Little Miss Sunshine takes place.All in all Little Miss Sunshine is an enjoyable comedy, with good values and sharp writing, and is really worth a watch whoever you are.",9,1,3,5 March 2007
Salt," loved it.
","I really did. Salt's heroine is interesting, complicated and for want of a better word 'awesome'. The storyline in hind sight is pre-posterous, but whilst watching, you're swept up in the interweaving sex appeal of the two leads, the meandering storyline and the high octane action sequences.Jolie as always is a solid and deep seeded lead, and with the support of Liev Schreiber who plays to his 'tough hiding a secret guy' keep the film from falling where lesser actors may have let it. Giving Jolie the lead over a man was the right idea, she makes an hero that Bruce Willis and Tom Cruise wouldn't have been able to make. Vulnerable, but deadly and secretive may have been a stretch for there overtly masculine persona's. The direction is nothing you haven't seen before in the Bourne trilogy or other slick spy flicks, but the pace is relentless and won't ever have you yawning at any point.It may well be popcorn fodder for most and there may be some kind of misinterpretions of certain countries, but it is a work of fiction, forgetting reality and getting into the story will help with enjoyment of this film.By no means the perfect action caper, however one of the best I've seen since The Dark Knight. Jolie is fantastic and I hope the franchise grows in popularity as it is 'The Best' female action vehicle I've seen.",9,2,5,7 November 2010
Mamma Mia!," Serves it purpose
","With musicals on stage coming out left, right and centre it was no surprise that they would start to put them back into film. With the recent Sweeney Todd film setting the standard for musicals, the Abba musical had a lot to live up to. To start with this was not going to be artful masterpiece that Tim Burton created, this was going to be a feel good movie that was designed to entertain. For this it works, however the story behind this film is quite simply terrible, and the singing isn't up to the standard of the likes of Chicago. Julie Walters and Meryl Streep steal the show completely, they're worth watching and Streep's version of 'The winner takes it all' is stunning.The film is a sure hit with women and most gay men, but won't satisfy the needs of most film lovers. Give it a try.",5,4,5,30 July 2008
Bridesmaids," Great comedy for all to enjoy
","What I loved about this film mostly is these ladies don't mind not looking glamorous if it means they will get a laugh. This is a rare thing, Hollywood women rarely are seen in an uncompromising state. Taking a film like the hangover, the women are sensible and the men make complete fools of themselves. Heaven forbid the ladies look like they have fun, its a rather stifling look at women in comedy, especially when you look at romantic comedies where the female leads rarely make much of a lasting impression.Enter Bridesmaids which is unashamedly funny, there are so many laugh out loud moments that some of the slower moments can be forgiven. The lead performance by Kristen Wigg is fantastic, as a neurotic down her luck girl, with a sharp tongue and a magnet for disaster. Bridesmaids works in the same way The hangover did, a great ensemble in that each bring something different to the table. Though at times I felt more could have been done with the supporting cast, Kristen Wiggs character is so much fun its only a minor grievance.The film is a laugh riot that should appeal to everyone, despite it looking more like a girls film, it is genuinely universally amusing. In fact there is enough gross out humour to compete with likes of American Pie.Bridesmaids is without a doubt the funniest film I've seen this year, though the ending I felt was a little bit too neat any negatives are fairly minor and are made up for by so many laugh out loud moments. I would rather watch this a thousand times than watch the hangover part 2 again.",9,1,3,29 June 2011
X-Men: The Last Stand," Bigger, but not necessarily better
","X men is by far the most compelling superhero franchise out there, as it has so many characters you like at least one of them. This film in terms of enjoyment was probably the stand out for me, however in terms of story and character development, this film was probably the worst of the lot. This films good points would be the incredible fight scenes and breathtaking CGI, however there are far to many characters and there is no where near enough story. What the director has probably done is tried to make it your run of the mill summer blockbuster and take no risks, but why not take a few risks with the X men they're risk takers themselves. Another thing that really could have happened is to make it longer. To be honest I wouldn't mind sitting through another forty five minutes of Xmen, and with the extra length better character development could have taken place. The film isn't all bad (or I wouldn't have given it an 8) they have incorporate storm into the film a lot more, Wolverine isn't the centre of attention, Dark Phoenix is superb and most of the acting (except Vinnie Jones) is rather good for an action movie. All in all this film isn't bad at all, it's not without its flaws, but it has a kick where other superhero films just don't.",7,0,1,21 June 2006
The Hangover Part II," Not so funny the second time around
","I loved the Hangover. The first film made me literally cry with laughter, what made it so funny was the element of surprise. Around every turn something you wouldn't expect happened. Don't get me wrong I did enjoy part 2, but I the laughs were so blatantly obvious. Part 2 isn't so much second instalment so much as a remake of the first one. It is quite literally a carbon copy of the first one, The events that take in The hangover come in the exact same order. I am a firm believer in if it ain't broke don't fix it, but such similarity with the first one cannot be overlooked. Even making the film based around a wedding I think was a mistake, they could have made they're literal hangovers from a night out anywhere for any reason. And the film didn't have to involve looking for a missing person again. This film suffers from sex and the city syndrome where the first one had way more laughs and felt more coherent, the second follows a similar format and falls flat. Though the negative reviews for the Hangover haven't put off potential cinema goers as Sex and the City 2's did.The film doesn't entirely sink though. It maintains an energy through out and and still has some pretty funny gags. It's not a joyless ride by any stretch, just one that feels overly familiar. Hopefully the writers will get some spark for Part 3 and make a much funnier movie.",4,3,6,9 June 2011
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A film that does everything right
","Eternal sunshine is a brilliantly original film. It's diversity sets it aside from other films about love. Kate Winslet's performance is fantastic and actually diverts your attention from her surprisingly bad acting in Titanic. Jim Carey's performance shocked me incredibly, as his stereotypical comedy roles gives the impression that comedy roles is all he can do. This is without a dought Kirsten Dunst's best film to date, however she and the other young actors let the were the only thing that slightly let the film down. The story was funny, but also very compelling. It is definitely a film to keep you happy, if you like the humour present. The comedy is extremely funny. Granted, the jokes are an acquired taste, like the film itself, but if you like original, brilliently directed films, you'll love this.",8,0,2,3 March 2005
Les Misérables," Half masterpiece, half mediocrity.
","I really wanted to love this film, some of the songs and characters are some of the best in any musical and the story is engrossing and very sad. I personally have not seen the stage show, so my comments are from reading the book (which was years ago and I can barely remember it) and on the films own merits.Generally the film hits all the bases; the drama is spot on, he comedy is dabbed here and there and songs are in their truest form. Where the film really takes flight is on the lead performance by Hugh Jackman whom is both staggeringly honest and extremely well sung (even if his voice begins to grate towards the end). Anne Hathaway steals the entire show in the mere 10 minutes of screen time she has - and she owns it - in fact the film often loses its way without her. The young actress Samantha Barks is also very good and her version of the famous 'on my own' is stunning.But where there is good there is bad, Russel Crowe being the worst offender. He neither has the acting ability nor the vocal capacity to pull off the role he is given and his songs sound more strained than the other vocalists. Amanda Seyfried also seems miscast, she has no chemistry with her males leads and her vocals sound terrible by comparison of Hathaway's or Bark's.In other areas the film generally works, the pitiful CGI at the start not withstanding the scenery is a sight to behold. Such a shame the director has no time to really have a look at it. The camera work is a little too erratic for my personal liking and barely gives the audience time to breathe between the mood changes.This does sound more negative than positive, but the negatives luckily don't take too much away from the general enjoyment of the film. It will likely tug on many people's heart strings but for myself I think a better director could have made this so much more.",7,2,5,22 January 2013
Titanic," A beautiful film, with a stunning end.
","Well Titanic was one of the films that made reviewers go crazy. I didn't really read any review that said it was awful, but now that is all people say. When it came out in 1997 everyone was talking about this film, it brought them to tears, the end scene shocked them, the love story made them feel warm. Now whenever anyone talks Titanic it is one of the worst films they've seen. Did I watch a completely different film, the acting was good, the computer generated images were amazing, the attention to detail was overwhelming. The script is the only thing that lets it down and there are worse out there. I found the whole thing to be very moving and if it was such a bad script it would make you cringe not cry.The people who call Titanic the worst film, obviously cried and are covering up for the fact it was one of the only films they cried at.I personally really like Titanic I think it's a very watchable experience that does leave you stunned if not tear stained. It is one of the only three hour films I can watch over again.",7,0,2,3 October 2005
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Enjoyable yet totally uneven
","Why did they release the ultimate Harry Potter film when it was so, not only unfinished, but bad.I could watch any of the Harry Potter films and be completely content and the same will probably go for this film, however I didn't find the latest Potter to be any better than the first two. Yes it was darker and it had a better story (but thats thanks to JK Rowling)so why did it go so wrong?It was unfaithful to the original book. They missed out a lot of detail that almost couldn't be missed out. They changed some of the events like Harry Vs the dragon and made illogical. They didn't even explain why the boys fell head over heel for Fleur. The film was a real disappointment as I thought it would be better than the last one which is still definitely the best. The one thing that really has to improve is Daniel Radcliffe. He is still bad if not worse than before and if he is going to be anything other than Harry Potter his acting has got to improve.",6,1,2,19 December 2005
Thor," Utter Nonsense, but loads of fun
","I have not read the Thor comics, nor do I no much about the marvel incarnation other than the fact that he has a hammer. So I really am taking this film as it comes, I'm taking it as a fan of science fiction and superheroes. In my opinion the major leader in the comic book movie world is Batman, and mainly the most recent Dark Knight. I've always found some of the marvel stories a bit harder to swallow, and Thor is no exception to this. In a way Thors back story is probably the most far fetched, I'd even go as far to say its utterly ridiculous, however that almost added to the fun of it.Thor keeps it light all the way through to its conclusion, and the drama is always in the melodrama making it all the more likable. It has epic and outlandish action sequences and even louder costumes than its special effects. The romance between Natalie Portmans scientist and Thor is laughable, misconstrued and cheesier than the old Stilton in my fridge. But for some strange reason this film works. It is so very entertaining, and really very funny. It has an almost self aware attitude that lends itself very well to this particular story. Other films of this genre could have taken a leaf out of its book, choosing spectacle and comedy instead of heavy drama and characterisation made Thor far more pleasant than its rivals.Take a film like spider-man, that is almost as stupid, but attempts to make it more grounded.When it attempts go for laughs its very false and Peter Parker never raised much of a smile out of me. Thor on the other hand is beautifully humorous and a fairly flawed hero. On a more negative note, though funny, Thor at times experiences some turbulence when it comes to its actors. No one really knows quite how to play the supporting roles. Thors allies are to often a bit serious and self conscious for the pantomime that there leader puts on. Kat Dennings was an obvious standout and Portman was once again great, even if her performance doesn't quite match Black Swan, but was it ever going to match that performance.All in all I believe Thor is a very enjoyable ride. Non science fiction fans will undoubtedly hate this so steer clear if you're not. But generally if you like Marvel movies this will not put you off. Its got me very much in the mood for Xmen: First Class.",7,1,7,29 April 2011
Burlesque," Good choreography and staging cannot make a film alone
","Being a Christina Agulera and Cher fan, the prospect of this film, and the trailer really enticed me to go and see it, however I was bitterly disappointed. Where the film really excels is on the stage. The dance routines are well choreographed and staged and do have an air of excitement about them, however once the heftier dialogue scenes took place you can see that neither the script nor the storyline have legs.The characters were very two-dimensional especially from the younger cast. Agulera's character didn't even seem to transition as she went from place to place, through each struggle. She played a so sweet she'd rot your teeth small town girl, with a big brain and big talent and her aggressive outbursts were laughable. Clearly Agulera does have a talent, which was over showcased, for singing. Her acting ability needs more work, her chemistry with the insanely good looking Cam Gigandet was as flat as the glass of coke thats been by my bed for 2 weeks. Other performers also failed to shine, Stanly Tucci who I am a fan of played his usual gay character with little enthusiasm and Kirsten Bell acting her abysmal dialogue as best she could.Cher clearly had the best character to work with, and played it reasonably well, and though with an inferior voice to Agulera, her numbers were a nice break from the excessive use of Agulera. Her face, however is so frozen in time that her acting ability is marred by the lack of expression her face can muster.The storyline was extremely weak and some of the scenes in the movie seemed to come straight out of the far superior Cabaret, starring Liza Minelli. Even though musicals don't have to have amazing story lines, it at least has to try and make the one it has as enjoyable as possible. Too much was crammed in. Several love affairs, the financial difficulties of the club, rivalry between the girls, hidden talents and friendships. Choosing one or two paths may have made this film far better, but it tried to fill too much into its excessive running time. The songs in the film though enjoyable were a little uninspired, and with Christina Agulera singing virtually every number they all start to sound a little too similar.All in all I really would not recommend this film, good song and dance sequences cannot lift this film from mediocrity and below. I went in knowing Christina Agulera had a good voice, I came out knowing nothing of the contrary. A little more scope and storyline could have made this film a whole lot more enjoyable. Instead I recommend watching Chicago or Cabaret again.",4,0,1,23 December 2010
Dark Shadows," Anyone else bored of the Depp/Burton collaboration?
","When Burton and Depp get it right it's an Edward Scissorhands, when they get it wrong it's a Dark Shadows. Burtons films are never 'bad', though Alice in Wonderland and Planet of the Apes weren't good, Dark Shadows just doesn't really deliver when it really could of.Johnny Depp plays the character well, but I think an English actor would have been better cast, as his accent sounds forced a lot of the time. Michelle Pfeiffer is usually fabulous but is just reduced to nothing here, and her chemistry with Depp is far more enticing than Depp's actual love interest, but it isn't explored.The pacing is all over the place, when the film is funny, it does it quite well. But the humour is so rare, it doesn't know how to balance the horror and the comedy, leaving it feeling like two films squished into one. Depps delivery is solid as always, but I just didn't feel this was the right film role for him. I felt this way in Sweeney Todd, although I thought the performance was good I felt Depp was miscast due to his lack of singing talent.Dark Shadows is OK, it is entertaining and has genuinely great moments in it. But these moments are too few and far between.",6,6,12,26 May 2012
Prometheus," Not quite the prequel Alien deserved, but then its not really Alien
","Well when Prometheus was announced some time ago I was more than a little excited, one because Alien is one of my all time favourite movies, and two Ridley Scott was directing. All these added together was more than enough to send my anticipation into a frenzy, then the first trailer came out. Oh my lord, that was it, I had to see this film at all costs.Then something happened, another trailer was released, then another, then another. Then viral videos, then behind the scenes stuff, then more trailers. Then I kinda guessed the storyline and the outcome of the film, and now I've seen it, I was by and large correct. The marketing over load on this film, may have been overkill. Such a shame because the teaser trailer was so promising, but I did still go and watch it and I did still enjoy the film despite guessing the storyline.Without giving too much away the film is set a few years before the original Alien film and explores the origin of mankind to the far reaches of space, but what they found may not be what they were expecting. One thing that did baffle me slightly was the technology used in the film, it made the future technology seem redundant, as the past seems far better equipped than the future, odd. But then this is both a positive and a negative, the positive being the film looks absolutely stunning, the set pieces are beautiful and detailed, the CGI is fabulous and photo realistic and virtually everything - down to the nearest speck of dust - looks good.The cast is a nice mix, but character development is missing on most of the crew. The vast majority of them are totally forgettable, so you feel very little for them, something that is usually fatal in a 'horror' film. But the main guys are great in their roles; Noomi Repace is well cast, though not a scratch on the Ellen Ripley character. Charlize Theron is fine in her cold commanding officer role, but is totally under utilised. But Michael Fassbender is on terrific form and completely steals the show, as the synthetic David.Where my main issue with Prometheus lies is in its similarity with Alien, its more of remake than a prequel in a way. Thats not to say its exactly the same as Alien, but it feels oddly familiar and strangely lacking in originality despite trying its best to be original. The idea of the crew of Prometheus searching for mankind is very interesting, but in the end comes off as redundant and kinda lame. It tries to steer the film down a certain path, but it comes off more as ridiculous than ingenious. In the end you know what's going to happen which is another problem, and there is no real payoff at the end of the film. Not only that the film seriously lacks scares, the music is too loud and in your face. There is no gentle creeping and no silence to keep you on edge. The film therefore comes across more as a bad action film, than a good horror.The trouble is Prometheus tried to distance itself from Alien and in doing so made itself less believable and predictable. But in a weird way I did like how they did it, could it have been better, hell yes, but did I ultimately enjoy the film, hell yes.Prometheus isn't the masterpiece it set out to be. Its not as creepy and horrific as Alien and not as thrilling as Aliens, though it does have its own merits away from the franchise. If a sequel is made I won't be queueing round the block to see it, but I do want to come back for more. So despite a bit of mixed bag, I would still highly recommend Prometheus.",7,3,9,1 June 2012
The Woman in Black," The suspense was fantastic, literally on edge of seat behind hands.
","Horror is my favourite genre of film, but these days the horror films that are churned out lack the most important thing and thats scares. While Woman in Black won't leave much of a lasting impression on you beyond the end credits, it must be noted that the film does pack a punch to your nerves where other films may just try to gross-you-out.Set in the late 1800's, the film looks stunning set in the dark north of England. The brick work and fog really set the mood, and the under-stated lighting allows the imagination to run wild. The film is directed with a certain flare, the camera is framed perfectly to fill with horrific images and the film is edited so very crisply. The music and sound is also a big plus here, atmospheric and above all creepy. The string orchestration sneaks into the back ground and at the times of pure silence and gentle thudding, it just makes it all the more effective.Though generally good the film does lack a fair amount of story. The first half hour seems rather pointless, and neither builds character nor furthers the story. And the worst of all is the ending, which not giving anything away, was just a little too 'neat' for my liking. The other problem I had is with lead actor Daniel (Harry Potter) Radcliffe, whom seems to only have two facial expressions. Though he played gormless fear rather well, his chemistry with other actors was non-existent. The worst sign of this is with his young son, there is a major unbelievability for his love for his son and this is fatal in the final moments of the film. Though by and large this is only a minor grievance, as supporting actors are great and the bulk of the films best bits are without dialogue.All in all Woman in Black is a superb horror film, and well worth a watch. It's a nice break to have a horror film, whose interest isn't to splatter blood and guts everywhere. It's the perfect antidote to the Hostel's and Saw's out there.",7,2,6,13 February 2012
X-Men: First Class," Clever, exciting, funny and stylish. What more could you want?
","I love the Xmen, I won't beat around the bush. There are so many mutants, heroes and anti-heroes that you relate can to at least one of them. The franchise has had its ups and downs. The first two films made the superhero genre what it is today. Stunning set pieces, breath taking special effects and a group dynamic that was brilliantly cemented in the second film. The third struck a middle ground where the spectacle overshadowed the narrative but was still a fun ride, and the last title Xmen Origins: Wolverine, was the only miss-step in the series. Xmen first Class is really very good. It manages to keep up with the first two whilst retaining an originality in its own right.The Direction is great, Vaughn's clearly got a knack for angles and keeping the audience engaged whilst the story chops and changes. The look of the film is modern, yet still has a 60's and almost retro look about it. The special effects are very good, though some how not quite up there with Xmen: The Last Stand. The energy is fast and relentless and the action sequences blend in with the dialogue sequences seamlessly.The acting is very good, though Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen are definitely missed, McAvoy and Fassbender do excellent jobs and really are in keeping with the characters you already know and love. Emma Frost and Sebastian Shaw are deliciously malevolent and Moira Mctaggart is perfectly pitched. My only reservation about the acting in the film is of Mystique, who I believe wasn't quite right, her motives in the film don't seem in complete continuity with the rest of the films.A sequel has already been planned and I shall be eagerly awaiting it. Having Storm back in the series would be a personal highlight for myself, but not necessary. I would highly recommend this film to anyone that has watched the original films and even for newcomers.One thing I will add that I have noticed since watching the original trilogy is that in 1980 Charles is walking, but according to First Class he loses this ability in the 60's...",8,104,172,1 June 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Wow, just wow.
","For the Dark Knight Rises to meet my expectations was going to be unbelievably hard, near impossible even, but it succeeded. Its a beautifully shot, awe inspiring epic film making at its best. The new characters mix in brilliantly to the verse and Alfred gives The Dark Knight Rises the depth it so desperately needs.Though the Joker is missed for his anarchy and sheer surprise, its something that just cannot be dwelled on, Heath Ledger died along with the Nolan Joker. Bane is a great and very different villain, he is a ferocious and brutal adversary, Tom Hardy fills his shoes very well and portrays a rather surprising amount of emotion just through his eyes. Anne Hathaway is a scene stealer with her cheeky Selina Kyle, a very different take on Catwoman from Michelle Pfeiffer's. She's playful, fun and above all sexy, something that Anne Hathaway hasn't really portrayed before. But kudos go to Christian Bale who gives it all he has as Batman/Bruce Wayne, he makes the character so fleshed out and above all human and his return to the action in the film is one of the highlights.What Dark Knight Rises manages to do is keep its long running time light on its feet, with a plot that is both engaging and interesting. It all ties together and comes full circle which is exactly what you want from a third film.The cinematography and set pieces are just unbelievable, the choice not to use 3D benefits this film, it can stand on its own without this irritating gimmick and hopefully Dark Knight Rises will signal the reemergence of non 3D films and films shot in IMAX instead.All in all Dark Knight Rises is a must see for fans of the last two film and anyone that likes quality film making. It gave me goosebumps on around six separate occasions, you know it's a good thing when that happens. This trilogy has been nothing short of epic and will live on well past its run at the cinemas.",10,2,7,20 July 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Harry Potter concludes. It will take your breath away...
","The final instalment is epic, beautiful, heart wrenching, funny, jaw dropping and enthralling. Part 1 sets the scene perfectly for the final instalment and the action comes in thick and fast. The final hour is an adrenaline rush of another kind, similar to that of Lord Of the Rings or even Return Of The Jedi every heart pounding second is deliciously played out to optimum effect and the special effects are (to put it lightly) incredible.The Harry Potter films in general are always a joy to watch, and this one is no different. Its soul purpose is to entertain its audience and boy does it work. Scenes featuring Britains finest actors are among the most enjoyable, Helena Bonham Carter is scrumptiously evil as Bellatrix Lestrange, and another side of her is shown to fantastic comedy value. Maggie Smith was always able to steal the show even when only in the film for mere seconds, here she demonstrates just how good she really is and her scenes are some of the most enjoyable in the entire film. And Ralph Fiennes' Lord Voldermort is a joy to watch, and gives the character an almost down-to-earth characteristic that makes him all the more threatening and to a lesser extent even sympathetic.The core core three Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are no longer playing around in this one. Radcliffe's progression as an actor has been slow, but ultimately very good. I was worried in the fourth film when I truly believed Radcliffe could ruin the rest of the series, but by film five he got back on track and managed to hold his own against Watson and Grint who certainly have a more natural knack for acting. His Harry Potter really is fantastic by this last instalment, he gives the character a warmth and humanity that he missed at times in previous films.All the characters in the film cement there lasting relationships in this last film, and though some rather beneficial and important moments are only scanned over, this is minor grievance as virtually nothing of significant importance is left out of the film from the book.Harry Potter has been with me since child hood all the way to adulthood and the films have continued the magic that JK Rowling first bought to my imagination with the Philosophers (Sorcerers) Stone. Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows part 2 is a fitting ending and the best in the series. And though I was never a fan of the epilogue from the book, even I struggled to hold back the tears as I bid goodbye to my childhood and my favourite fantasy saga.",9,2,5,14 July 2011
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," A perfect combination of action, drama and thrills
","Poor Katniss Everdeen she is just so unlucky, what with the two stunning young men following her around, some serious skills in archery and a supporting cast of acting excellence. But in all seriousness one of the things that makes Catching Fire so good is the emotional gravitas it has, despite being a sci-fi futuristic dystopia future with really bizarre senses of style, Hunger Games has emotional weight which is really good to see in a blockbuster such as this.Jennifer Lawrence proves she deserves the Oscar she won, even when dealing with dialogue that isn't always up to scratch, she makes it work. Her supporting cast are equally good, Donald Sutherland in particular is just brilliant.The only reasons I have marked the film down are simple; occasionally bad dialogue, a slightly sluggish middle section and the fact the direction feels a bit less interesting than the first film. But even with these small criticism's I'd still highly recommend it and it does marginally improve on it's predecessor.",8,3,20,20 November 2013
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," An overly serious and underwhelming installment
","I have to admit that I really did not enjoy the simplistic and shallow narrative of the first twilight book, however I quite enjoyed the first film, I was impressed with direction of the original director. Though I still find the story fairly childish and naive as a form of light entertainment I would 100% recommend the first film. Moving on to New Moon, which I must admit I have not read, but I watched the film as I wished to see where the film would go after being impressed with the first film. I was unfortunately very disappointed. The direction was uninspired, safe and ugly compared to the original. The special effects were also fairly substandard for such a money making franchise such as this. The story was over dramatic and humourless, and the character of Bella is unrelatable and pathetic. When Eclipse reared it's ugly head I was excited by the director and the prospect of a far more action orientated installment. But I was once again let down by a film that is much the same as New Moon, stilted and lacklustre action sequences, poor computer generated imagary and Bella once again unrelatable and humourless. The two leading gentleman look good but give stiff performances. One thing in Eclipse's favour is the way it's shot. The scenery is stunning and is shown off in subtle and yet grandeur way, so kudos to the director for this but it really is not enough to lift this film from the badly melodramatic and pretty anti-feminist story. I will complete the series too see how it all pans out, but I'm praying that things improve. The producers should get Joss Whedon to come and help them out.",3,7,14,5 July 2010
The Cabin in the Woods," Original, absurd, funny, jumpy, clever, preposterous, obvious, surprising
","So many emotions and feelings came when watching this film, the first was 'what have I just witnessed', the second 'that was f*ing brilliant', the third 'that was kinda stupid', the fourth 'that was very clever', the fifth 'I've never seen anything like that before' and the sixth 'I wanna see it again'.I don't really know what I was expecting here to be honest, I thought it might be a fairly generic horror film with Joss Whedon's fantastically witty dialogue. And in some ways I was right but mostly I was completely wrong. This is a very hard review to write without giving away any plot points, but you may see some of it coming, but you'll never see it being done in this way before.To be honest the only thing I can say is just go and watch it and make of it what you will. I thought it was great, and came out of the cinema with a grin on my face. This is a hard film to gauge how different people will react, I expect most will find it enjoyable and funny, but others will loathe it, its definitely a 'Marmite' film. To be honest this goes for a lot of Wheadon's writing and props go to Drew Goddard for an ace first time directing gig.So despite this rather lame review where I have struggled to comprehensively give an opinion, I really loved the film a lot and would recommend giving it a watch. But this isn't for everyone.",8,2,11,24 April 2012
The Godfather," The best gangster film yet, but an acquired taste
","I found the godfather to be slightly growling and over long, however I am not a gangster movie fan. You cannot put the Godfather down for it's immaculate acting and terrific set design. Marlon Brando was absolutely fantastic and never failed to shock with his brilliant performance. Al Pacino didn't impress as much as I thought he would, however, he carried off the performance with style. The hidden details within the Godfather are subtle yet enthralling. Attention to detail is duly noted and can be seen in many of the scenes, including where Michael makes his first killing. The change in character is subtle yet powerful and you can't help but wonder whether he's doing it because he wants to or because he feels he has to. all in all, The Godfather was a good FILM however I found it slightly dull but may appeal to another audience.",6,2,7,22 September 2005
