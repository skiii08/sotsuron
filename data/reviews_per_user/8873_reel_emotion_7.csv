3:10 to Yuma," Destined to be Another Classic Western
","After the great Johnny Cash/June Carter Cash biopic, Walk the Line, director James Mangold tries his hand at a western, 3:10 to Yuma. Expectations are highwith this being a remake of a classic western and with the hopes of this movie resurrecting the genre.I purposely avoided watching the original Van Heflin/Glenn Ford 3:10 to Yuma. I also haven't read Elmore Leonard's short story that it is based on. I want the remake to prove to me alone its merits as a movie, as well as a western, without having to compare it to other things.Besides focusing on the two main stars of 3:10 to Yuma--Russell Crowe as criminal Ben Wade and Christian Bale as rancher Dan Evans--, 3:10 to Yuma has a great ensemble cast. Some people claim that Ben Foster steals the show and out bad-guys Crowe as Charlie Prince, Wade's second man in command in his gang of outlaws. Peter Fonda gives a convincing performance as a bounty hunter who is not afraid to smart off against Prince or Wade against better judgmentWade, handcuffed, throws Fonda off a cliff for insulting his mama. There is also the nice character of Doc (Alan Tudyk) who tells off the man responsible for burning down Dan's barn. Look for Luke Wilson in an excellent cameo performance as an evil, racist railroad flunkywho kidnaps Wade when he manages to escape from Dan and the other men. Wilson takes Wade's gun with a crucifix on the handleaccording to Wade, the gun is cursed, and Wilson is shot down by Foster, who in turn takes Wade's crucifix pistol. Guess what happens to him.I see the main story in 3:10 to Yuma as down-on-his-luck Dan Evans trying to prove himself to his family. The other story is Wade's robbery of the bank coach and his capture, which leads to Dan's quest of delivering Wade to the train bound for the Yuma prisonthe only way for Dan to provide for his family at this point. All these stories and the characters make for a good western.Dan may seem like a wimpnever mind how disrespectful his older son William (Logan Lerman ) is to him--for letting Wade steal his horses, but this character will do anything to protect his family. By the end of the movie, we know Dan is not a foolthe truth comes out about how he lost his leg to friendly fire in the Civil War and why he continues to live on the dying ranch in Arizonabecause the climate is best for his youngest son suffering from tuberculosis. Dan tells Wade that he was no hero in the war and saw no actionand says, try telling that to your sons. Before Wade constantly annoys Dan with accusations that he doesn't take care of his family properly. At one point, Dan pushes Wade to the ground, gets right into his face and says, I'll cut you down right here. Dan is willing to stand up to Wadeperhaps killing him even if it would mean losing his gravely needed $200 to keep his home. With Dan's confession to Wade, who always wants to know how he lost his leg, Wade lets Dan escort him to the traintelling Dan that he has already escaped the Yuma prison several times. This is the turning point in the movie--white hats and black hats together.Although all the other stories and characters are interesting, a valid criticism is that the movie doesn't focus more on the complex relationship between Wade and Dantheir scenes are the most interesting parts of the movie. Wade is a ruthless killer/criminal, but he acknowledges that he is rotten. Dan is an honest, hard-working man who believes on keeping his promises. In the hotel room hours before the train is to arrive, Wade offers Dan money to let him go, but he refuseseven though Wade makes a convincing argument that this is the money that the crooked bankers have cheated Dan out of. Who is the worst criminalthese men or Wade?The ending sequence is suspenseful. William sneaks out of the hotel room to help his fatherwill he get killed? Who will finally kill the psychopathic Prince? As Prince compliments Dan on being a tough old rancher, he shoots him in the backall the while Wade tells him no. Prince, holding the crucifix pistol, is shot down by his hero, Wade. William has a chance at revengeto shoot down Wade, but he lets him go on the prison train, proving that Dan did the right thing as he told Wade that William would never turn out a criminal because he taught him how to be decent. The lesson is learned.The main theme of 3:10 to Yuma is redemption. We have the redemption of Danwho, though in doing the right thing, has made the ultimate sacrificeliterally dying for the salvation of his family. Crowe and Bale each give incredible performances. I think Bale's acting is the most impressiveplaying the quiet desperation of his handicapped-in-many-ways character. Certainly Wade is the flashier cowboy, but Dan is the heart and soul of this story. We have the redemption of Wade who in spite of his willingness to shoot down even his own men is a sympathetic character. You think he is doing the right thing when he kills the man who burned Evans' barnalthough Dan says that he was an a s s hole that he didn't necessarily deserve to die. Wade is funny and quirkysomething of a thwarted artist who is always sketching. We also know of his abandonment as a child. Wade's redemption is letting Dan be the hero. He willingly goes to Yuma prison, but we suspect he may escape as he whistles for his horse who runs after the traina great ending for a western.",9,2,5,18 September 2007
Public Enemies," Retelling of the Dillinger Legend with a Modern Perspective *spoilers*
","Public Enemies is a good, solid biopic of John Dillinger--with action, romance, good acting, and metaphors abounding about the nature of good and bad. I'm not sure how close director Michael Mann stuck to the facts of the story of John Dillinger, but he sure adds his trademark realism. We are brought into the world of Dillinger--the pay-offs, obtaining the cars, his ties to organized crime, his bank robbing. We are brought into the world of a forming FBI--the first uses of wire tapping and hard tactics to do whatever it takes to get their guy, Dillinger.Mann picked the right actor for each role, knowing the particular strengths of both Christian Bale and Johnny Depp to bring what they did to each character. Bale brought a kind of stoicism and presence to the character of Purvis, which I don't think Depp could have. And vice versa, I think Depp played Dillinger well, and I think Bale was suited better to the Purvis character. Depp added an impish charm to Dillinger, and I was impressed by his acting, not being a fan of his acting at times. I think both men, too, were probably better suited to the physicality of their real life characters.Bale plays Purvis as a new sort of G-man--able to think about the logistics of catching the criminal (wait until he buys a new coat; wiretapping) and he has the ability to use the muscle behind it (being a sharp shooter). Purvis wants to do a good job and meet his objectives--Bale says very little in the movie, but there is much in his face about how uncomfortable he feels when he ventures into morally questionable territory (basically, IMO, Dillinger is executed). Dillinger is just a simple man, really, who wants to be with Billie and have money--he's not bad, only in the fact that he'll kill anyone who gets in his way. He's made uncomfortable by Baby Face Nelson's joy and glee in violence and murder, but he doesn't really have a moral dilemma like Purvis does. In Public Enemies, Purvis and Dillinger are both the heroes while Nelson and Hoover (played well by Billy Crudup) are both the villains.We can see the difference between Purvis and Dillinger during the confrontation scene at the jail. Dillinger is talkative and doesn't waste time on telling Purvis what he thinks of him, but Purvis says very little and just stares him down. During that scene (almost reminiscent of the scene between Agent Starling and Dr. Lecter in Silence of the Lambs), Dillinger questions Purvis on how it is to see someone shot down and dying....he knows that Purvis doesn't enjoy it. Throughout the movie, we see Purvis looking at each person (outlaw and G-man alike) shot down and dying. Towards the end of the film, we see Dillinger with one of his men wounded and dying--he optimistically refuses to believe the man is dying and tries to patch him up.My favorite part of the movie was the romance between Billie Frenchette and Dillinger. Although most of it was played out in shallow clichés of first dances or witty repartee, it rings true. Franchette is a good girl being swept off her feet by a charming, good man who just happens to rob banks and kill people for a living. Frenchette confronts Dillinger with the inevitable--that he will eventually be caught or killed--but the cocksure Dillinger doesn't think he will be. Marion Cotillard does a good job with this role--their relationship is the key to making Dillinger a sympathetic character in the movie.Character actress Lili Taylor plays the female sheriff of one of the prisons. Mann makes some surprising feminist commentary in this film--perhaps because one of the co-writer is female. We also have the interrogation scene of Billie being beaten by a brutal G-man adhering to Hoover's order to do anything necessary to make the witnesses talk. The one woman working at the FBI (secretary?) brings it to Purvis's attention when he arrives back at the office--he puts a stop to it in a very calm way. This is one of the key scenes that highlights the moral dilemma of who is the real criminal here--and is part of film's contemporary social messages that apply to our times today--in the time of such things as the 'Patriot Act.' Public Enemies is an entertaining (sometimes slow) movie which can be enjoyed on many different levels.",8,6,17,1 July 2009
The Killing Fields," Brutal and Realistic Depiction of War-Torn Cambodia
","The Killing Fields follows the story of A New York Times journalist, Sydney Schanberg, and his Cambodian translator, Dith Pran. Schanberg is there to report on Cambodia's border being bombed by the U.S. during the last years of the Vietnam War. These bombings make Cambodia vulnerable to the takeover by the Khmer Rouge regime, which becomes Schanberg's new story.Schanberg and his colleagues are journalists who want people to know what really is going on as opposed to the watered down/non-existent radio/TV coverage about Cambodia's problems. John Malkovich's photo journalist character makes a snide remark about a certain BBC reporter who must sneak reports past the Khmer Rouge soldiers in the beaks of chickens that somehow make it to Thailand.Schanberg gets Pran's family out of Cambodia to America as the American Embassy and everybody else is getting out of Cambodia because they know that the Khmer Rouge is going to takeover the capital city. But Pran stays behind with Schanberg. Pran sees the Khmer Rouge parading through town and believes there might be peace, but his hopes are dashed as the Khmer Rouge soldiers kidnap Pran and the journalists for awhile. Things in Cambodia go from bad to worse, and the journalists are given one last chance to leave, but no Cambodians can go. The journalists try and doctor a passport for Pran, but it fails. Schanberg and the other journalist believe Pran will die at the hands of the Khmer Rouge. Malkovich blames Schanberg for Pran's fate. Schanberg begins to symbolize America in the way we bombed (used) Cambodia (Pran) and left it behind just when they needed our help.Disturbing scenes of children caring guns, a young girl suffocating a prisoner, and skeletons floating in a ditch show the atrocities of this dictatorship. Somehow Pran manages to survive in a prison camp--where he is starved, brainwashed, and tortured. He finally escapes and reunites with Schanberg.There are some scenes in which some subtitles would have been appreciated. The Killing Fields has been criticized for leaning to the left in its view of what happened in Cambodia, and I agree with that. It's really amazing that a movie like this ever got made considering the Hollywood machine. I recommend The Killing Fields for fans of Vietnam movies. And considering our times now, it is certainly interesting viewing.",8,5,5,7 April 2003
American Psycho," Those Blood-Stained '80s
","Directed by Mary Harron (I Shot Andy Warhol, The Notorious Bettie Page) and based on Bret Easton Ellis' (Less than Zero, The Rules of Attraction) controversial novel, American Psycho follows the antics of stockbroker/serial killer, uber yuppie Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale). When watching this movie, you must remove all serious films about serial killers from your mind because American Psycho is a parody of horror movies and a satire about the materialism and shallowness of America during the 1980s. If you can view this as a very dark comedy, it works. Patrick Bateman is a blank slate of a human being who puts on the mask of being the modern male. He displays all the trappings of what constitutes the successful male in our society: lots of money, lots of women, lots of partying, and lots of toys (i.e., for the '80s, his Walkman, CDs, and, of course, video tapes.) But all the successful male trappings are only Patrick's outfit he wears in society to fit in. The shiny superficiality is reflected in the immaculate white and stainless steel décor of his apartment. The only thing that that makes him human ultimately is his blood lust. When committing his horrendous acts, he breaks through the shiny exterior to the 'meat and bones' of it all where the deeper meaning might liethat is why when Patrick murders Paul Allen, it so disturbingly satisfying and amusing. After Patrick is done hacking up fellow stockbroker/nemesis Paul Allen (Jared Leto) who keeps confusing him with another stockbroker, he turns, and one side of his face is covered with blood, and the other is not, so you finally see the two sides of Patricka human with some complexity. With all the mistaken identity in the movie among the stockbrokers in their accepted uniform of identical designer haircuts, glasses, suits , and not to mention business cards, Patrick commits suicide in a sense with Paul Allen--murdering himself, and all the artificiality of his lifestyle. As for the anti-feminist, misogynist criticism that both the book and film received, having Mary Harron as director does bring more of a female sensibility to American Psycho. I don't think a male director could have objectified Christian Bale's body as beautifully as Harron did, especially in the shower and chainsaw scenes. If you look at the female characters, they are quite lost, and that is a commentary on society. Courtney Rawlinson (Samantha Mathis), Patrick's mistress, is a high society girl whose only function in life is to take pharmaceutical drugs, and Evelyn Williams (Reese Witherspoon), Patrick's fiancée, is a rich Daddy's girl whose only function in life is to shop. On the DVD there is a hilarious deleted scene in which Patrick and Evelyn are in bed, and Patrick strides on top of her, unzipping his pants, while Evelyn looks away at the TV and tries to watch the Home Shopping Network; then she looks up and deadpans, 'What you want me to do with that? Floss with it.' The most disturbing scenes to me are when Patrick kills the homeless man, the dog and Christie the street prostitute. The homeless man scene is pure camp as Patrick tells him that they have nothing in common. As for the stomping of the dog, it is all implied with sound effects. For a movie that is considered so violent, much of the violence is implied and left up to the mind of the viewers. The chainsaw scene is where the movie uses every cliché in the scary movie business: the madman chasing the woman in jeopardy and bloody corpses popping out of closets. As Patrick wields his chainsaw towards Christie, it becomes more phallicthe chainsaw, the nail gun are all just extensions of his penis, an ironic sign of both power and insecurity. As Christie runs down the stairs, from a top Patrick positions the chainsaws and flings it down the stairwell with perfect aim, piercing her body. After that Patrick becomes an unreliable narrator in the movie, and you wonder if this is real. For some reason, the image of Christie pierced with a chainsaw reminds me of the infamous Hustler cover of the woman being fed through the meat grindera much referred to image by outraged feminists. But as disturbing as both scenes are, both are crucial to the movie's point of being a dark comedy and parody. Christian Bale (Batman Begins, The Prestige, The New World) will always be remembered for his role of Patrick Bateman. He eats the camera herealthough not literally! Some have thought his acting to be exaggerated, but that is the point: Bale plays someone who must act through his life to achieve his goal of 'fitting in.' Bale's performance also gives a bit of humanity to Patrick, especially during the scene where Jean (Chloe Sevigny), his secretary, is at his apartment. Bale acts charming to Sevigny's obliviousness all the while he looks in his kitchen cabinets full of murdering tools. He aims a nail gun behind Sevigny unbeknownst to her. A comical misunderstanding happens between them as Jean thinks that 'getting hurt' by Patrick would be by having an affair with him while he knows that it would be killing her. Sadness washes over Bale's face as he tells her that she better go, and, for a second, you see a real person. American Psycho will not be for everyone, and the ending is cryptic. It doesn't romanticize the '80s, but it captures some of the ugliness of it. The soundtrack is pure guilty pleasure with Katrina and the Waves,Simply Red, The Information Society, New Order, Phil Collins, and Huey Lewis and the News. Bateman spews out little interesting, if somewhat pathetic reviews of these musicians and songs to his victims beforehand. You'll never hear 'Hip to be Square' or 'Sussudio' in same way again after watching this movie.",8,2,5,26 June 2007
The Exorcist," Kind of Real Scary
","***Spoilers***I remember being thoroughly entertained by this movie when I was younger, but now I find it a bit of a bore.  Although I never saw it during its heyday, when people left the movie theater, thinking they were possessed.The priest's archeological dig, Burstyn's acting gig, and the other priest's homelife were all very slow placed scenes to me.  Thirty minutes into the movie and nothing much has happened except some weird noises in the attic.When we do finally see Blair with her gray face, red eyes, messed up hair, she looks like a kid made up for Halloween.  The floating objects, the moving bed, etc. are almost laughable now.  By the way, it isn't green pea soup she is spewing out--it's the mixture from her feeding tube--but in pop culture, it has become pea soup.I recommend The Exorcist to horror fans and '70s pop culture fans only.",Null,0,1,10 April 2003
Velvet Goldmine," 2VG: Fade Away Never
","Todd Haynes' film, Velvet Goldmine, is a masterful tribute/love letter to the glam/glitter rock movement of the 1970s. All the audience really knows of Velvet Goldmine's idols is what any fan would know. We experience the story through interviews and musical performances and that astoundingly provides us with enough information. It's the aesthetic of 'man's life is his image'that superficial beauty expressed through art reveals so much more than at first glance. Haynes (Far From Heaven, I'm Not There) has a passion for music and its artists that shows: his earlier short film, Superstar, about Karen Carpenter, acted by an-all Barbie and Ken cast, is referenced in Velvet Goldmine in one of my favorite scenes in which two young girls play with Brian Slade and Curt Wild Kens while T-Rex's 'Diamond Meadows' spins on their record player. In Velvet Goldmine, a top-notch, well-chosen cast acts out the principle characters and stories here wonderfully.Glam rock superstar, Brian Slade (based on David Bowie), is played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers ('The Tudors,' Elvis, Match Point) to perfection with his thin, effeminate looks and swaggering. Haynes has great fun with the notion that there was a time in popular culture history that androgyny and bisexuality were seen as a cool fad. Velvet Goldmine's main story is Brian Slade's rise and fall from fame. Slade's cold and calculating ways accumulate in the hoax of his own assassinationthe ultimate symbol for the death of glam rock. His most sympathetic side is revealed during his affair and subsequent break-up with punk rocker Curt Wild.Ewan McGregor (Trainspotting, Star Wars Prequels, The Island) plays Curt Wild by feverishly emulating Iggy Pop--although the history of Wild having electroshock therapy to cure his homosexual leanings is straight from the life of rock icon Lou Reed. McGregor's performance of 'T.V. Eye' and 'Gimme Danger' are startling and unforgettable. Both Rhys Meyers and McGregor do their own singing for their characters. Upon seeing Wild's performance, Slade is obviously envious of him and attracted to himinspired, Slade takes his music to the next level. On his first trip to America, Slade doesn't forget about Wild and meets him. Slade and his entourage go to a club where Polly Smalls (Donna Matthews and Teenage Fanclub) performs in a very Suzi Quatro way. Wild sits in the corner, obviously strung out on heroinall the while Mandy Slade, Brian's wife, laughs. But Slade gets Wild a music contractand Slade becomes Wild's new 'main man.' Later Mandy describes Slade's and Wild's relationship as being marketed as some sort of new Tracy and Hepburn. Mandy and Brian become more estranged.Toni Collette (Muriel's Wedding, In Her Shoes, Little Miss Sunshine) is perfectly cast as the love-her-or-hate-her Mandy. Pay close attention to her accent: She is not doing it badly--here is an Aussie doing an accent of an American woman who would often speak in a faux English accent. Brilliant. Mandy goes from being an audacious woman to a cynical woman. Ten years later her broken marriage is the only interest anybody has in her as rock journalist Arthur Stuart interviews her in a bar.Another one of the three gorgeous male leads, Christian Bale (American Psycho, Batman Begins, Rescue Dawn), plays glam rock fan/rock journalist Arthur Stuart. Although his part seems to exist as a frame tale, he's the most effective and relatable character in Velvet Goldmine. The subplot of Arthur is one of the most unique coming out stories about being a closeted homosexual along with being a closeted glam fan. In his bedroom, teen Arthur listens to his Maxwell Demon album while staring at the seductive gatefold picture of a semi-nude Slade. Does he want him? Or does he want to be him? Bale's acting here is a revelationhe reveals so much through those eyes and facial expressions. He also has a major transition: he goes from a wide-eyed, vulnerable, and fan-obsessed teenager to a downcast-eyed, jaded, and wiser adult. Much to his chagrin, the adult Arthur is given the assignment of finding out whatever happened to Brian Slade. He clearly wants to forget his past, but is it from embarrassment of youthful fanaticism, or is it something more? Leaving home because of his sexual orientation and love of glam rock, young Arthur does not have to live vicariously through his idols anymore and can start living his life as he must. After the Death of Glitter Rock concert, young Arthur meets Wildthat leads to a one night stand on the roof top and Arthur's literally taking the place of his superstar idol, Brian Slade, in Wild's heart if just for one night. Adult Arthur overcomes some of his jadedness as he confronts and makes peace with his past. During Tommy Stone's press conference, he asks him about his connection to 'bisexual pop singer' Brian Slade'Tommy Stone' being Slade's '80s more commercial reincarnation of himself. Earlier in school, young Arthur scribbles out a sketch of Brian Slade while his teacher reads from Oscar Wilde's Picture of Dorian Gray, which sums up Arthur's experience: 'He felt that he had known them all.It seemed that in some mysterious way their lives had been his own.' In Velvet Goldmine there is the theme of the permanence of art. Todd Haynes shows that this musicand this movie--is much more than disposable pop culture, but akin to the works of Oscar Wilde and the movie Citizen Kane, both which he references throughout, and that art is kept alive by the appreciation of it by the fans. Oscar Wilde's emerald pin symbolizes thisas it passes to one artist to another, then to a fan, Arthur. In return Arthur Stuart gives his Tommy Stone press pass to a young eager fan. An old favorite, '2HB,' plays on the jukebox, and we see everyone enjoying the music. One person says, 'God, I love this song.' Velvet Goldmine ends with the final message of the song: 'fade away never.'",10,3,6,28 July 2007
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Clouded by Other Movies of 2004, but Just as Good
","Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind asks the question: if you could lead a life without loss and unhappiness, would you really want to? It can be described as part sci-fi, part black comedy, and part romance. The characters are 'quirky,' and I would be happy just to see a movie between the bickering gen X couple played by Mr. Show's David Cross and Happiness' Jane Adams. The cast is impressive, and there also is nice plot twist in the end.On the negative side (or the positive side for some), the story seems to be created by writers under the influence of recreational drugs. It may be too surreal for some viewers. At first, the frame of the story may seem impossible to follow, but be patient, and it is quite easy to understand. All the questions are answered by the end of the movie. If you can stay with the movie, you will find it entertaining and meaningful.",8,0,2,5 March 2005
