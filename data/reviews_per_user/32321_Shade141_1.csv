The Ring," The Best Horror Flick of all Time!!
","[**WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS**]When i saw the previews for this movie, i didnt think it would be all that good. But then, when i went to see the movie, i freaked out after the first five minutes! when i saw the look on katie's face after her mom opened the closet door, i was like 'DAMN!'. Then i really got into this movie. its a bit confusing but it works! This is by far the scariest movie i have seen. the acting is great and the plot is great! A Must see for any horror movie fan!Overall, i give this movie a 9.5/10Not perfect, but great!",Null,1,2,15 May 2004
