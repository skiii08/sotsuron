The Legend of Bagger Vance," ONLY IF YOU LIKE GOLF
","Only if you like golf should you see this movie!  I am sorry, Mr. Robert Redford, but the story does not do justice to the calibre of your actors.Fairy tale story about a drunk (forget the World War I connection) who has lost his self-respect and confidence and is 'lost' for 15 years (Matt Damon as Rannulph Junuh) and beautiful Charlize Theron (Adele Invergordon) who for 15 years still loves Junuh and pines for him when she should have moved on with her life.  Along comes an 'angel' in the form of Will Smith (as Bagger Vance) who knows all about the golf game and for only '$5.00 guaranteed' and the pair of shoes he 'broke in' becomes the caddy for Junuh and throughout the game 'helps' him to regain his long lost self-confidence.'What we have here - is failure to communicate!'  What can you get out of a golf movie?  Players chasing the little white ball from hole to hole.  The predictable 'drama' of golf balls going into the sand trap, the water trap, the trees, and other common golf hazards routinely associated with the game.
Where is the drama?  Adele was pursuing her own issues trying to convince Rannulph that he still loves her all the while interfering with the championship match that 'she' organized and produced.  Did she need to confront him behind the trees on the final round and break his concentration causing Rannulph to land in the sand trap?  No, that's self-defeating.  Did she have real dialog to speak?  No, not worthy of the role she beautifully acted in 'The Devil's Advocate.'Matt Damon looks manly and the ladies like him.  But, his dialog is weak. He can perform much better than the script he was given.Will Smith has accepted better challenges.  Essentially, he plays it 'smooth' and delivers like he was reading narration in a high school English class.  In this script is his mission in life to be the 'angel' to help wayward and lost Junuh to rediscover himself?  Who did a great job?  The young J. Michael Moncrief who played young Hardy Greaves.  This first time youthful actor, never before in a movie according to Robert Redford's trailer interview, shows the most emotion and acting ability.  'First times a charm!'  Lane Smith needed more to do.  Bruce McGill and Joel Gretsch just played golf and showed professional courtesy to Junuh.  With only three players in the tournament why work harder?Jack Lemmon was uncredited in this film (WHY?) as he played the Old Hardy Greaves telling the dubbed-over story of that one special moment in his golf life before he, now an old man, walks into the sunset to die on the old golf course he played all his life.  Of course, there's Bagger Vance on the hillside waving him to come 'over to the other side.' 
Life's over! And, so it should be for this film.  I gave it a '4' out of respect for the actors who could have made a better performance had they had a different story line and script.  Save the golf stories for tee time on Saturday mornings at your local course!",4,3,6,5 November 2001
Spartacus," See the Restored Film on the Big Screen
","On a huge silver screen in a 1,500 seat Italian Renaissance Theater, I viewed the epic film.  Restored in 70 millimeter film, you cannot fully appreciate this work viewing it on a TV screen.  While Spartacus is a historically accurate person the movie makes slight changes to his history.  We find Kirk Douglas as Spartacus being taken into slavery at age 13 and now in the rock quarry in Libya, North Africa prior to his being sold to Peter Ustinov as the gladiator school owner, Lentulus Batiatus.  A historical note on an Internet website reports that Spartacus was a Thracian Soldier who was captured by the Romans and sold into slavery. This aside, the drama and telling of the story of slaves wishing to be free men is more compelling than this slight historical inaccuracy.For almost the first hour of this long 190 minute epic, Kirk Douglas has few speaking lines.  Rather, he acts by his eye movements and sheer presence on the film.  The film is heavy with excellent extreme facial close-ups which when seen in 70 millimeters makes for dramatic acting in spite of the lack of dialog.  What is remarkable is the way the film shows and tells the story of how gladiators were trained at 'schools' to perform in the arenas of Rome.  See this film for the training school sequences alone and you have received your money's worth.Kirk Douglas begins to speak more dialog after he and his fellow gladiator trainees overrun the school and set out to free all slaves being held in Italy.  However, the most dialog and most skillfully acted is the scene stealing performance of Peter Ustinov as Batiatus.  Strong performances were made by the great Charles Laughton as the senior Roman Senator, Sempornius Gracchus.  A Roman Republican, Gracchus weaves a web of political intrigue which ends in his not shown on screen, suicide. Sir Laurence Olivier as the power seizing Marcus Licinius Crassus is a believable power behind the throne who wins in the end.Charles McGraw plays the gladiator trainer Marcellus.  Marcellus was a slave gladiator who survived the arena and was promoted to gladiator school trainer by Batiatus.  Watch how he dies during the slave revolt.  Good performance by McGraw.The subplot is a romance between Spartacus and Bratiatus' household slave and slave concubine Varinia played by the lovely Jean Simmons.  Her only flaw when viewing her close-ups is that Hollywood makeup artists gave her overly large black eyebrows which detract from her pretty face.  Spartacus, whom in this movie we are lead to believe has been a slave for more than 15 years or so and obviously 'without woman' falls in love with Varinia and she with him.  History records, however, that Spartacus had a wife before he was captured and made a slave.  But, without a romance and a pretty face, these 'swashbuckler epics' would not survive on the sheer weight of the fighting sequences and political twists and turns.Once the slaves escape and run wild liberating 12,000 slaves of Italy, Douglas and Simmons declare their love for each other and become common-law husband and wife.  A boy child ensues.  Watch to see what happens in the end.The final battle scenes using 8,000 real Spanish Army soldiers marching in attack formations becomes too much for the slave army to overcome.  Craccus prevails and the entire slave army is destroyed and the survivors crucified along the famous Apian Way Road into Rome as an example for others not to repeat this again.Tony Curtis a slave poet and magician/juggler, Antoninus, who first resembles a pacifist becomes an able right hand man and Lieutenant to the new General of Slaves, Spartacus.  Despite Mr. Curtis' renowned 'New York' accent, you seem to forget it due to the action-in-every-scene of this movie.  Spartacus lives long enough to see from his Varinia and his infant son being smuggled out of Rome with the help of Batiatus and the money from Gracchus as Simmons hold up Spartacus' son and from the cross, Spartacus knows that his son will grow up a free man.An error was made in naming John Gavin's character Caius Julius Caesar who became head of the Roman Guard.  Caesar is a title meaning Emperor and thus the younger Caius Julius would not have been referred to by the name Caesar until he later became the actual Emperor of Rome.  In fact, it's more accurate to refer to him later as Caesar, Julius rather than Julius Caesar. In the same manner, Christ is not the last name of Jesus.  Rather, Christos in Greek means the 'anointed one' and thus, it is a title, also.   
John Ireland plays slave gladiator and Spartacus' lieutenant Crixus, although he has little speaking parts he fights well.  Woody Strode as Draba gave a memorable performance.This movie is a solid '9' and should be seen on the widest TV screen you can find, or else watch for a revival showing on a huge theater screen.  Don't miss it!",9,2,4,16 November 2001
Casablanca," Summary: The Greatest Love Story of Our Time
","If you are a patriotic person you will 'know' that to win a war requires great sacrifices of your own desires, wants, and needs. Here, in Casablanca we have a simple story, of which the movie producers themselves didn't think would become such a classic, which has captured the hearts of all who see this movie.Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine is a man's man. He is courageous and fights a war on his terms with his own resources. The beautiful Ingrid Bergman portrays a woman (Ilsa Lund Laszlo) torn between her true love and her duty to her husband whom she once believed was killed in the war. The moral is that 'duty' takes precedence over personal feelings.Paul Henreid as Victor Laszlo the 'underground resistance leader' plays his role straight with dedication to the cause of freedom and 'understanding' when he learns of Ilsa and Rick's past affair in Paris, France. The most inspiring part was when Victor leads a song challenge with the French National Anthem in Rick's club against the boastful German Army. The emotion of this scene was so strong that it brings tears to the eyes of any true patriot.If you are a lover of Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, and Claude Rains, you will find classic performances here! Conrad Veidt played the German Major Strasser to form. I understand that Madeleine LeBeau (Yvonne)is actually French and you can see the tears of patriotism on her face as she sings a most inspiring rendition of Le Marseillaise (French National Anthem).Dooley Wilson plays Rick's piano player in Casablanca. It is true that 'the world will always welcome lovers' As Time Goes By! 'You played it for her - you can play it for me. Play it, Sam. Play it!'",10,1,1,24 September 2001
Grease," RYDELL HIGH SCHOOL - CLASS OF 1959
","In 1959 I was 17 years old and a junior in High School. How do you cast actors to play 18-year-old high school seniors about to graduate? You don't look for actual high school seniors  - that's how! Because, the industry would not have such acting talent available with the experiences of singing, dancing, and acting to make this film. Solution? You cast, 34 year old Stockard Channing, 30 year old Olivia Newton-John, 31 year old Annette Charles, 28 year old's Jeff Conaway and Michael Tucci, 27 year old's Didi Conn and Susan Buchner, 24 year old John Travolta, 22 year old Kelly Ward, 21 year old Eddie Deezen, and 20 year old Dinah Manoff to play the roles of high school seniors. Believable? YES.
You can get away with the 45 year old Edd Byrnes as Vince Fontaine and the 38-year-old Frankie Avalon as the teen idol. Joan Blondell was a 72-year-old waitress! Eve Arden was a 70-year-old principal? Dody Goodman was 63 and still a school secretary. Sid Caesar was 56 and still coaching? Alice Ghostley was a 52-year-old auto shop teacher? No kudos to TBS who broadcast an edited version on 12/26/01 eliminating some of the great sophomoric comedy scenes from the film. An example is Sid Caesar's 'admonition' to the senior class at the gym before the dance was to be televised. The comedy was that he 'laid down the rules' and the students in student fashion broke them during the dance contest. But, this scene was not shown. Edd Byrnes scene trying to 'put the make' on Marty Maraschino was also cut as well as some of the attempts by Sid Caesar to find a sport that John Travolta could 'letter' in. High school comedy is replete with 'innocent sexual innuendoes.' Such is a transition from juvenile to being an adult -- which is what high school is all about, anyway! Don't eliminate them for the sake of a 'G' rating. Just show Grease after the kiddies go to bed!Now, although the entire cast garners praise for this movie performance back in 1978, the real show stopper is Stockard Channing. Without her Betty Rizzo character as a subplot there would be major weakness in this screenplay. Ms. Channing's performance is the strongest acting of all the 'student' players. She brought to the role the struggles of typical high school students who don't always fit into the peppy, socialite, 'Patty Simcox' roles where everything is provided to spoil the student; where her daddy doesn't buy her a fancy car; where her clothes are functional and not typical 'coming out' wear. But, Stockard Channing makes this role believable. She is sympathetic to understanding her character. She is a decent person trying to find her identity on the brink of adulthood. She is searching for a good love relationship and absorbs the heat thrown her way by fellow female students who are 'boy teasers.' Rizzo is real. Ms. Channing's rendition of the song, 'There Are Worse Things I Could Do' solidifies her character in song. Without that song there would have been a terrible 'gap' in this film. Ms. Channing 'carried' all her scenes and deserves the ultimate praise for helping to make 'Grease' the hit movie that it is! When you watch Grease again, make sure you catch an unedited version to fully appreciate it!If a cable station is going to play 'marathon' movies back to back then there is no reason to make them fit into a neat time slot. Fit the commercials in, if one must, but let the movies run full time! Cutting films is not the act of 'preserving' good quality motion pictures for future generations!Once again, the highest accolades to Stockard Channing. She will always be remembered for her Rizzo role in Grease! Well done, Ms. Channing.When I was a senior you were a sophomore... hummmmm!",9,1,2,27 December 2001
Duck Soup," FUNNY - FUNNY and Classic Marx Brothers
","When times of war or economic chaos beckon, maybe it's time to escape and spend a little time laughing to the antics of the classically funny Marx Brothers!You can't help but be hysterical as Grocho plays Rufus T. Firefly the hastily chosen leader of the fictious European country, Freedonia!For all their silliness I am always amazed at the musical skills of Chico on piano and Harpo on the harp during their movie making.  The are the forerunners of the kind of comedy that Liberace may have adopted decades later.  Fourth brother Zeppo plays the straight role as though his brother's zaniness is nothing to be alarmed about.Margaret Dumont as Mrs. Teasdale deserves an Oscar for putting up with the insults of Grocho as she is his foil in many of these Marx Brothers movies. Noteworthy is the beautiful Raquel Torres as Vera Marcal.  One will remember her years later.Some view the Marx Brothers movies as slapstick.  There is a message here regarding the frivolous conduct of Nation States.  Watch this movie and learn now NOT to govern a Country!",10,0,0,24 September 2001
Big Fish," You can count on Tim Burton to tell you a 'tall tale.'
","How many of us have met someone who always tells us 'tall tales?' Are they true stories or are they mostly exaggerated? As you watch this film your mind may well be asking that question: Is Albert Finney's life as Ed Bloom, a mere figment of his imagination or did he actually live all those 'adventures.' Such is the theme of this fine Tim Burton film from 2003.What I like about Tim Burton's films is that I can NOT 'second guess' the story as it progresses. That keeps to a surprise what's coming around the corner in the next five minutes as the scenes progress.The film is well served by the acting talents of Albert Finney, Ewan McGregor, and Billy Crudup in the two main character roles with Ewan McGregor playing the young man Ed Bloom and Albert Finney playing the senior Ed Bloom.Another delightful surprise is how Tim Burton casts some well known actors to play small but significant supporting roles. I would say that these well known faces had no more than 15 minutes of screen time throughout the film but they were instrumental to the total performance: Jessica Lange, Helena Bonham Carter (Tim's main love in real life), Robert Guillaume, and Danny DeVito. If you have watched HBO's 'The Sopranos' then you will also enjoy Steve Buscemi's (Tony Soprano's cousin Tony Blundetto) performance as Norther Winslow (although he has been in 89 films since 1984!). Identical twins, Ada Tai and Arlene Tai are uniquely cast in the scene as entertainers of the Chinese Army! See how Buton uses these twins in the story! Am I hearing the same 'twinkle' music in the background like I heard in 'Edward Scissorhands' and 'The Nightmare Before Christmas?' Effective in creating the almost fairy tale image. I'm not going to tell about this film, scene for scene, nor offer insight into how it ends. Rather, you need to tune your cable box to when this feature will be shown in your area or check the local video store.It's all about the 'process' of story telling.'Once upon a time, there was this man who dreamed he was really a fish....a fish out of water!'",9,2,3,27 May 2005
The Dark Knight," Needs Great Improvement
","As I was driving north to Chicago to visit my sons, I heard rave comments on talk radio about this movie. On opening night people were lined up at theaters to see the show.So, I decided to treat my son and grandson to this event. We went to the 11:45 p.m. show and had to wait in a line for 1 hour after buying our tickets.Now, almost right away, I became bored with the movie storyline and the layout of the presentation of the scenes. Why?#1. The scenes were choppy. Not enough time was spend focused on the actor's faces to develop good audience rapport with the characters. #2. The actor's dialogue was limited. I felt that there were too many one-liners which do not lend themselves to stretching the talent of the actors.#3. While I recognize that the storyline was about a dark side of Batman and unlike the more campy versions before it with Michael Keaton, Jack Nicholson, and Kim Basinger, I felt that I was wishing that the movie story could be more like the prior Batman films. At least the director of the previous Batman story treated us to good images of the characters and allowed adequate face time of the stars so that you could identify with them. The Dark Knight was much lacking in this regard.#4. For waiting in line for 1 hour until permitted to enter the auditorium and being subjected to at least 30 minutes of movie previews and advertising, I felt that this also tended to tire out the audience in addition to the 2 hour and 45 minute movie on top of the waiting!#5. And, the romance angle was lacking to say the least!So, if you liked this movie, fine. My 11 year old grandson liked it because there was lots of noise and explosions. And, seeing the streets of Chicago allowed me to identify with places that I have been to in that city. I, however, would have preferred a much better acted movie. I found myself dozing off in the auditorium seat. I do hope you liked the film. I did not enjoy it all that much. Any Academy Awards for this film would be ill advised.Larry from Illinois",4,8,41,19 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," HARRY POTTER - A movie for ADULT fantasy not kids...
","This is very good movie! My adult son and I went to see it on Thanksgiving night.  There were no kiddies in the movie, only adults, a sleeping child, and some teenage girls.  This movie is really a fantasy that adults will enjoy.  First, the cast is all British and Irish.  It is good that American actors were not considered for this film.  Because, we 'Yanks' would not know how to properly act with that British-aire!  It's a good thing we speak the same language because it would be difficult to follow along in English subtitles!  Wonder how the rest of the world is truly understanding this film with subtitles or voice overs in the local language?Anyway, you don't have to have read any of the Harry Potter books to enjoy this film.  And, maybe that's a good thing.  I wasn't interested in a fantasy story of some 11 - 12 year old children to have read any of the books.  But, as a movie, it does make for a good story.I won't bother 'telling' the story or commenting on some of the tricks of the trade.  My only real criticism is that I had difficulty understanding some of the dialog of the young child actors due to their soft spoken diction and my lack of familiarity with certain spoken phrases and styles of British speech.  Also, as Yanks, many of us don't meet people sporting these uniquely British surnames.  It was only when I saw the cast list on www.IMDB.com that I could understand these characters' last names.12-year old Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), his 11-year old friend-girl Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and his friend-boy Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint - age not listed in IMDB) are people with magical powers. 
They are recruited into the freshman class (6th grade?) at an 'Oxford-style' University of Wizard Training!  Remember, it is the British lifestyle that this book/film depicts.  Like Oxford, a school composed of a number of distinct colleges, the Wizard U has four different 'houses' or colleges where the wizards in training are placed according to some inner wizardry ability.  You see this school rivalry by the different colors of scarfs, banners, and neckties the children wear.  In the beginning of the movie, we have a sort of borrowed Cinderella story. Harry Potter, an orphan, is living with his wicked stepparents and wicked cousin until he grows up enough to enter the Hogwart's Wizard School!  One wants to smack mean-wicked Uncle Vernon Dursley (Richard Griffiths) and Aunt Petunia Dursley (Fiona Shaw) as well as cousin Dudley Dursley (Harry Melling) for their meanness to young Harry Potter.  Young Melling acts like Augustus Gloop the overeater and 'piggy' from 'Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.'  He gets his 'in the end.'Veteran performances by 71 year old Irish actor Richard Harris as the Headmaster Albus Dumbledore (see what I said about 'British' names?) and 67 year old Dame Maggie Smith as Professor/Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall were a pleasure to view.  This proves that there are good roles for older career seasoned actors/actresses.55 year old Alan Rickman has great facial expressions and one look from him and you feel you are 'guilty' of some long lost childhood prank just discovered. Mr. Rickman should have had an expanded role and more speaking lines.  51 year old Robbie Coltrane plays a major role as the Gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid.  One will like the Hogwart's schools traditional sports rivalry in the form of a 'cricket' style match with young wizards flying full speed on enchanted witches brooms!  One wanted to laugh when Harry Potter receives a 'gift' of a Nimbus 2000 Model super-flying broom!  Why don't the other kids in this college have one like it?  A bit of a sticky wicket, ay?There are lots of computer-generated graphic interfaces in this film.  And, it helps to tell the story.  I enjoyed the travel back in time to maybe 18th Century England where Hagrid takes Harry to purchase his special wizard 'school supplies.'  Humm, all the characters here are wizards and Harry begins to learn that he is famous and 'expected.'Later into the film, we have what is reminiscent of the 'quest' as in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.  What kinds of 'powers' do ruby-red stones have, anyway?  I suppose, that in subsequent films, and as Harry and his friendship group grows a little older, we will find them involved in more 'enchanted adventures.'  If the entire cast remains and grows up in this genre, then a little romance between Harry and Hermione is needed.  A little innocent hand holding and a few kisses would help the interaction between these two characters. Remember 'The Wonder Years?' So, if you want to finally see a new movie where you won't second-guess the next scenes, then, see Harry Potter.  Forget about reading the books if you have not done so and just enjoy the next six films that may ensue over the next dozen or so years to come.  Maybe this will become a Thanksgiving tradition.Forget all the talk-hype about anti-religion, witches, black magic, etc. This is a NO HARM fantasy movie.  The 'Devil' is not going to invade one's household.  Just think about Samantha Stevens from 'Bewitched' for all those years we watched her on TV and in reruns.  This movie is that innocent. Good triumphs over evil.  Whether you are a wizard or a mortal!
OK, so I 'told' a bit of the story.  Anyway, it's a '9' and 'Two-Thumbs Up!'",9,0,0,24 November 2001
Valkyrie," Movie Disappoints
","I am sorry to say that this movie disappoints. Now, the actual historical story has been done before on a documentary shown on the History Channel in the past. In fact, I have seen it more than once. So, the story is known and therefore being based on a true story the movie had a lot to prove. For a few reasons it did not live up to its challenge.First, while Tom Cruise is a well-known actor, his almost whispering delivery throughout the film made him come off as an actor with a monotone. There was little drama in his acting and it appeared that he was content and the director was content to allowing Mr. Cruise to simply look good in a German uniform and give glaring eye contact throughout most of the movie.Second, with all the detail and expense of dressing almost the entire cast in German uniforms the general lighting scheme of the movie did little to enhance the costuming design. Very dim lit scenes inside rooms and offices was apparent and did not help the visual effect. Even in the era of the 1940s people had better lighting inside their homes and offices. The lighting did not have to have the 'overall orange effect' with faces in 'half-shadow.' Why Hollywood people think this is a good effect is beyond me. It is boring when seen in the movie theater when the screen is so darkened and it makes one want to fall asleep watching such scenes!Thirdly, having actors who pronounce their English words with British accents while pretending to be a German is laughable. To make such a film realistic requires (and with all respect to the fine acting staff, however) actors who are real Germans and can speak the English language yet retaining their German pronunciation of English words. This should have been a movie with all German actors and actresses who had English speaking lines.Future movie makers should consider my suggestions and recommendations to really make a fine WWII motion picture.Larry from Illinois",6,0,4,26 August 2009
