Captain Phillips," Gripping and compelling
","From the small details, family life in the beginning talking about the kids and how it is so different for our kids today.Also other details such as (make sure you lock the lower deck doors), it kept the audience engaged at all times. How an ordinary day can turn into a nightmare and your worse fears become a reality (e.g how Rich was obviously on high alert after reading the email hence the drills) just kept us right on the edge of our seats. Watch how the Navy responded is reassuring and praise to their executed plan. They were dealing with people who are extreme and therefore had to take extreme measures.Tom Hanks acting along with his crew and Mach the other main character was brilliant. Its truly worth watch and worth every penny!",10,2,4,28 November 2013
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Times are changing
",An amazing film but to be fair I watch it with the best 3D glasses that really enhanced every detail. The story line was excellent. Hydras meddling with tech they had no idea what it would bring and no doubt more to come. The humor and lines to give you a laugh in the tense moments which gave relief to my neck from tension for a few seconds was right on cue. The actors played their parts with precision and I am sure they had a lot of fun making this film. The credits go to the graphics and the support crew in the designs of the sets and costumes.I highly recommend you watch it on a big screen in 3D and be prepared to an action filled movie.,9,3,9,23 April 2015
Saving Mr. Banks," Touch everyones emotions.
",When you want to bring to life a book to screen can be such a challenging journey. Yet this is exactly what Walt Disney had achieved. This is a story of such passion and commitment that this brings out and as the author was in no doubt reliving her childhood memories touches your very emotions to the core. Sometimes we hold onto grief believing we are doing the right thing for the ones we lost along the way. But just as Walt Disney could see in this great story he wanted to pass on something that is more valuable than the physical e.g the book or movie it was hope based on imagination. This was a sad story but he knew it could be told which compassion and fellow feeling that could touch all of us. We all would like to tell our story and perhaps fabricate the ending so that all of us can come to terms with our loses that happen to us along our life's journey. This gives us time to reflect on our own past experiences and to reconcile with them. Great job!,8,1,6,7 December 2013
