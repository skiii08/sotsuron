Blade Runner 2049," one of the greatest films ever made
",'it doesn't matter what is real as long you are special'this film outdone itself thanks to Denis villeneuve miraculous direction ...roger dickens was powerful as cinematography supported strongly all the dramatic scenes ....compared to the original this film takes a different angle to blade runner ... Denis villeneuve themes are grounded with also ridley scott's original very felt forming a mixture of extreme tragedy and complexity ..... it takes the idea from the original film and creates drama and tragedy from it .....this film is also a sequel more than anything it continues from the point the original ends and doesn't offer mush explanation for the people for the first time to see the blade runner universe .... there are some scenes that has tight relationship to the original that will crush you emotionally .... there are so many meanings from every frame ....as for the surprises ..it will surprise from the first scene.... that is how surprising this film really is .... this film is more dramatically powerful Than the original ...but for they are both ultimate classics.....the films leaves with cliffhangers which even increases the dramatic and emotional effect of the film 10/10,10,2,10,9 October 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," lord of the rings in space ...best star wars movie yet
",Okaay ...I am here as film lover and addict more than being a star wars fanboy...all I want a great film ...star wars saga has great films ....I went looking for something themetically rich ..high in drama ....action ...some comedy...darker tone ...innovative plot .....after leaving the theatre I got all of this and more than expected...so why many star wars fans didnt like it ....well to be honest the film is more of a film than a starwars film ...which in my opinion makes it even greater...I accept fans will not like because they wanted the legacy of star wars to continue which btw opposes the film idea ....the film's has so many themes about present past and future and parentage and the idea of becoming special .....this film is DEEP emotionally as it explores the idea of being special at a diferent angle ....I generally hate the idea that someone is special because he is son of '....' or he is special because he has lots of power ....the movie totaally opposes that idea ...the film in my opinion made star wars a lot better instead of relying on the originals it is a film that wants became something new ....the problem that fans hates anything new they want reboots of the originals that is the truth ....this film however is something on its own separated themetically from other starwras films and building its won stiuation and ideas on its own .....for me as scifi fan and also a lover for great star wars film ...this is an epic scale entertaining adventure with darker tone filled lighthearted moments and poster like images that sticks to your head forever with high concepts and better world building .....it is totally unforgettable ....BEST STAR WARS FILM EVER MADE because it solved in my opinion many problems in the entire saga and made it more richer and more entertaing than before a thousand times however people will hate it because it is less star wars than before ....which makes it my opinion better star wars,10,9,23,15 December 2017
Silence," any true movie watcher will be silenced after this
","this is one of the best of martin Scorsese since taxi driver ,unbelievable as it shows the true discovery of what faith truly is ... the movie is for every one ..even atheists ... its utterly flawless and very powerfully deep ....this is undoubtedly the best movie of 2016 ...although the movie was 3 hours but I didn't get bored at all ... Andrew Garfield was the main character of this movie while the others were like mostly supporting but very influencing and had many time in the movie as Adam driver and another character..the acting is not Oscar worthy but Andrew Garfield was exceptional ...but we saw the movie through the eyes of Andrew Garfield...Liam nesseon finally gets back .... the cinemaphotography was stunnnnnnnnnnning and overwhelming from beginning to end in every second .....the script is beautifully written ...and the quotes are beautiful ..I am really shocked that martin Scorsese didn't get nominated for best director although he deserved ...please go see it ..so you don't regret in the future",10,0,1,3 February 2017
