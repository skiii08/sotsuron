Skyfall," System.out.println('HACKERS!!!!!!!!11111one');
","I think Daniel Craig makes a great James Bond, but unfortunately this movie suffers from writing that couldn't be any worse if you gave some pencils to a bunch of monkeys.Apparently an ex-agent who's completely nuts (Silva, played by Javier Bardem) is a master hacker able to control every network on the planet and make almost unlimited amounts of money by manipulating stock and politics. It doesn't make things any better that the hacking is portrayed in a way that will give everyone who knows a little bit about computers a major headache. It's about time the old farts in Hollywood stop pulling this magical computer crap out of their a*ses and make computers and hacking in movies more realistic - but I guess then they'd actually have to come up with a coherent story and explain things instead of saying 'hackers did it'. Then on the other side, we got the new hipster Q (Ben Whishaw) who is supposed to be an expert on these matters and invented software that 'only six people in the world can understand', yet somehow manages to not know the first thing about computers and get the MI6 network infected with Silva's malware.Silva, a genius like no other, then proceeds to get himself killed in a personal vendetta that is so over the top that one can't help but facepalm throughout the movie. I wish a super ex-secret-agent hacker would destroy studios that make movies like this, but instead this trash gets five Oscar nominations (...which again says something about the current state of the academy awards).To be fair, the acting, effects and music were good, but considering the complete lack of a decent story, giving more than 3 or 4 out of 10 would be delusional.",Null,14,27,13 January 2013
