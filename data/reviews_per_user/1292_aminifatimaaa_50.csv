Black Swan," taut and intense but also dynamic
","Harrowing, alluring, and simply magnificent; Black Swan is one of the most aesthetic pieces of filmmaking. Combined with a deserving performance by Natalie Portman, fantastical direction by Aronofsky, mind-melting and horrific imagery, and a general theme instability; the entire film culminates in a work that can only be described as perfect.",7,2,3,10 June 2019
Your Name.," truly a unique, artistic and incomparable masterwork
","This movie has a little something for everyone. Romance, supernatural, comedy, and emotional moments that made my jaw drop. The beautiful animation and characters that you care about are what draws you into this gorgeously drawn film. I was enthralled by this movie. I can see it being one of the best animation movies ever created.",10,0,0,28 December 2018
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," soul enriching
","This film was so endearing and the characters were totally relatable. The screenplay flows so seamlessly intertwining the monologues and the narrative beautifully that neither seemed out of place. And for once the monologues felt necessary and had an important role to play, a role which expositions the state of Charlie's mind and his inexpressive self. Logan Lerman is just a perfect fit for the role. His twitchy eyebrows, pensive hands, the reticence shackling him from merging with the world were perfectly believable and more importantly struck a chord with me, which in turn, I think, is the most important thing which must happen in order to love this film. I cannot shower enough praise on him. A film which was perfectly cast and not easily forgettable",8,1,2,21 February 2019
Train to Busan," creatively mind-blowing
","Directed by Yeon Sang-ho, Train to Busan immediately earns a place in the canon of great zombie cinema. Layered, emotional, and riveting, the South Korean product blends human drama, thematic depth, and jolting horror in its tale of commuters trapped within a train while an epidemic rages without. The production is sleek, the violence is biting, and the characters are worth investment. It is the rare horror film whose spirit and energy engender the desire to watch the work again immediately after the credits roll.",9,2,4,24 February 2019
Passengers," very average and mediocre
","Passengers had a lot of potential, but sadly it failed to live up to it. Its a movie that is almost the sheer definition of 'average'. It tried to juggle multiple genres at once, such as a horribly done love story and an action movie finale, and it doesn't do any of them well. You wont have a terrible time watching this, but its definitely the definition of an average - or even below average - sci-fi movie.",6,1,2,29 December 2018
Zootopia," zootopia.. a heave of fresh air
","Zootopia is a quick-witted, fast-paced romp through an imaginative and painstakingly rendered world. While its core mystery and adventure plateau early, the film's loud subtext adds robust texture to the narrative. It all provides a smart, good-looking, and richly funny animated experience. This film stands out as a treat for the eye and ear.",9,4,5,3 March 2019
The Impossible," a deceptively simple enough film on the surface
","The Impossible is less about the natural disaster itself or sharply defined drama and more about the survival of its core protagonists, so those looking for a film broad in scope may be disappointed. The film is harrowing, inspiring, and well-acted. The cinematography is at times gauzey and, at times, crystal clear. Overall, the film is a servicably made, thematically straightforward experience that can be both gripping and moving.",7,1,2,12 March 2019
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," hilariously epic
","A tender,delightful take on love which is sure to please the hearts. Characters were great and easily relatable with an appreciable study gone into it. Elegant cinematography,soothing background score and glossy performances from Steve Carell and Julianne Moore, simply adds icing on top of the cake.",8,1,2,18 December 2018
About Time," a glorious sight to behold
","About Time doesn't concern itself with the technicalities and science of time travel, because it isn't a film that is about time travel. About Time, rather, is about life, love, and family. It's a film that speaks to the idea of slowing down and appreciating the world around us. It's a film that highlights the fact that there is magic in the mundane moments of life.",10,3,4,11 January 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," phenomenally entertaining with bedazzling action
","Thor: Ragnarok is a hilarious, heartfelt action epic, the film boasts the personality, character, and color needed to create a masterpiece. The film distinguishes itself with heady themes and presents all of this with a tone that leans towards comedy. The action film is bright and hillarious at times, but it never forgets the darkness of its violence or the heat of its heart. The cast were excellent and created very memorable performances. Thor: Ragnarok is a electric and deliciously entertaining film that allows its audience to have a glorious experience.",9,3,5,20 May 2019
Children of Heaven," a visual feast of art and emotions
","Majid Majidi is pretty much known for his overabundant humanism, and whereas several films treat such topics in a very fashioned, unrealistic way, this film offers believable possibilities, overwhelming magic and a finale so inspiring you'll feel your heart exploding. Thanks, Majidi, for such a needed tribute to neorealism!",10,1,2,27 December 2018
Moana," a simple heartfelt ode about discovering oneself
","Moana is a simple, fun adventure, very much in the vein of classic Disney films. First off the animation, which is fantastic.

The films style and great characters make this a joyful experience to watch",8,0,2,29 December 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," visually spellbinding
","Marvel knows how to create a good superhero film. With fun humour and action sequences, it's what you expect but in all the right ways. It manages to do enough with the superhero formula to feel mildly fresh with a great portrayal of the titular character, and a pretty good villain. Recommend.",9,0,0,31 December 2018
Life of Pi," truly inspirational

Lion," moving. spell-binding
","Nothing could prepare one for the emotional experience of watching this movie. Overwhelmed by tears that would heed to no reason. The little Sunny Powar tugs at your heartstrings and you weep as if he's your own. You walk with him, see the world through his eyes, see him too and you melt in all that this kid personifies. His intuitive sense of things that are beyond what he can understand, to be able to catch the whiff of danger and to flee every time, his strength and bravery, even at that young an age. Telling the tale that memories don't die. They come back at an unexpected moment to haunt you. A visual of something long forgotten. A fleeting fragrance. The weapons with the power to kindle violence in the mind. As Saroo struggles with his yearning for a past long lost, you cry with him. You want him to find them. You want him to get all that he seeks. In that moment when he has all but given up, on that last thread of the rope he's been hanging on, he looks outside his box. He dares to look beyond logic and there it is, the past right before his eyes. Daring to go back to a hurting past and finding love - an incredibly beautiful journey that you are fortunate to be part of. There you learn, although you cried that the child was separated from his brother and mother, how many more lives has he touched because of that fateful incident. Had he stayed there on that station, it might have been a life of forgotten misery without the guiding light of his brother. But now fate propels him to bless the lives of souls far-away and through his movie, touch the hearts of many. A roaring tale of love and perseverance.",8,0,0,6 January 2019
Romeo + Juliet," a fundamentally broken concept
","Luhrmann's puzzling mishandling/misinterpreting of renowned literature is something to behold. Some will say this is a breath of fresh air on a story already adapted in countless ways, but evidently the outcome has been a failure. Whether it be amidst over- exaggerated performances, or perhaps the irritating visuals is appalling.",4,0,0,23 January 2019
Bird Box," beautifully horrific, terrifying and heart warming

","Swiftly paced and fully developed, grand-scaled yet intimate, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring provides an excellent start to a series of films that would only increase in stakes, quality, and craftsmanship. From its beginnings in the Shire, to its unceasingly dangerous world of orcs, goblins and dark forces, the film increases in spectacle, glory, and engagement as it progresses. It is a remarkable first chapter of one of cinema's most remarkable series, and it is a beautiful imagining of one of fiction's greatest tales.",8,0,0,17 March 2019

Dangal was exhilarating & phenomenally entertaining beyond relief.,8,1,1,29 May 2019
Now You See Me," an unexpected find
","Now You See Me does not possess depth, philosophy, and hidden messages, nor aspire to some sort of artistic value. This is an illusionist action movie, whose purpose is to entertain, and in that purpose, it succeeds. Although not comparable to the greatest cinematic achievements, this film is perfectly executed and directed, featuring exceptional performances from the cast. Totally mind-blowing.",8,0,1,16 June 2019
Saw III," haunting and chilling
","Crisp, violent, and completely engaging, Darren Lynn Bousman's Saw III is a horror sequel at the top of its franchise's game. Fitting like a puzzle piece into the scheme of the larger series, this third chapter finds its protagonists clashing in a cat and mouse game of traps and morality while the game's Svengali lies dying. Bousman imbues the work with sickly glow that juxtaposes a near graceful intricacy of scene and story. The work is pulpy and gruesome, but it is gripping and cracklingly constructed.",8,0,1,25 February 2019

The Imitation Game," an artistic triumph
","The Imitation Game boasts an outstanding lead performance, a fine story, and a fully realized production design. It is elevated however, by its sharp and poignant themes.

Saw II," grungier, gorier, more deranged
","A twisty and twisted tale of deadly morality, Saw II is both an effective sequel and a satisfying stand-alone horror. It's a rare horror sequel that both honors and outperforms its preliminary chapter.

It all makes for a memorable and icy fear-ride.",8,0,1,20 March 2019
