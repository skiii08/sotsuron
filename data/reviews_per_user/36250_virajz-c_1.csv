Iron Man 3," A little different from the previous two but still a complete entertainer
","This movie clearly is a lot different than the previous movies in the sequence. Instead of continuing the from Iron Man 2, Iron Man 3 goes back into the past when Tony Stark makes a mistake that today threatens to loose the most important thing for him in the world, Pepper.The movie has a lot of story throughout and action only towards the end and the fact that the plot hasn't really continued from where it was left in Iron Man 2 which may disappoint some viewers. But let's not forget Iron Man 2 wan't the last time Tony Stark appeared in a movie. It was in The Avengers. So Iron Man 3 is really the post Avengers than post Iron Man 2.Iron Man suit has undergone a lot major technological advancements in this movie. The suit is now completely robotic i.e, You don't even need to be wearing the suit to be able to fight. The suit now basically is a robot controlled by Jarvis when Tony isn't in it. Also the suit can be worn on the fly, which was hinted in The Avengers.Overall a complete entertaining, worth watching movie.",8,1,3,21 May 2013
