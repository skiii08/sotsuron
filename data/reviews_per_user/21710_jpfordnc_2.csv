The Lobster," Don't watch
",Stopped 49 minutes in hated it. Just not worth the wasted time.,4,0,3,24 May 2020
Da 5 Bloods," great movie
",This is only the second movie by spike lee that I've seen and so far both where a home run. especially this one I loved every minute of it. it is pretty rough but lets be honest Its real life not the avengers so if you can't handle blood or the little bit of violence that was put in this movie then don't watch it. because my family all said it was too violent(at least the ones that watched with me) or they said it was glorifying violence. so I say if you can handle the avengers but not this based off of real life then you really need to get your life straight. hope you enjoy the movie.,10,5,16,15 June 2020
