The Blair Witch Project," How not to make a movie
","The Blair Witch project opened in New York this month to more buzz than a vibrator.  Excited, I purchased my tickets and went to see what I thought would be 'The Horror Flic of the Summer!'It ended up being a horrible flop of an evening.Normally when talking about a horror movie it is very hard to give any plot detail for fear of giving away the movie.When talking about 'The Blair Witch Project' it's very hard to give any plot detail because it lacked a plot.Because it is styled as a documentary, it is shot with two cameras, one video, one 16 mm, both grainy, and unclear.  The film follows the three main characters into a forest, where they  quickly fade into the grainy and unclear background.87 minutes later, my stomach growling from boredom, I left the theater wondering, why not shut the camera off?",1,1,3,26 July 1999
