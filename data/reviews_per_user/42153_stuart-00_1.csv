Skyfall," .Disappointed.
","Back from my local Cineworld and unfortunately Skyfall is wellIts disappointing.It seems as if the ethos of Bond has gone, The cars, chases, gadgets and more so the story line are poor. Yes the DB5 is a stunning automotive piece of art but not for a 2012 film, the chases and gadgets seem none existent and the story line is simple and predictable. What amazes me more is the IMDb film budget of £ 200,000,000. Cant for the life of me think where it went apart from the ever expanding salaries. When this film gets edited for TV no doubt for a commercial channel, 33% of it will disappear to make way for adverts. And you know what You won't notice what they cut out.I love the BOND franchise and each and every film they have done, but this is just too. Laboured.",7,15,33,28 October 2012
