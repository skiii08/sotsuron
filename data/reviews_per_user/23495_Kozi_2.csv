The Blair Witch Project," Think about it - YOU ARE AFRAID
","On going to see 'The Blair Witch Project' about 3 or 4 weeks after it's release in Britain, I went in with a very open mind. I was excited about the film ever since i heard about it and with so many mixed reviews, I was hopeful.After getting used to the shakey camera and my eyes managed to focus on the VHS-C camera quality, I felt involved from beginning to end. Hearing so many rumours of how they filmed it, I forgot all about the unimportant stuff like that and began to be interested on the finished product.There were times when I thought to myself - you just wouldn't run a camera at that point. But I think this was covered by the superb and chilling last 10-15 minutes.Very creepy, and very entertaining. You will go to sleep thinking about it.",Null,0,0,5 December 1999
The English Patient," Beautifully Elegant
","From the opening shot to the final tear in your eye, The English Patient is an intellegent and elegant film full of beautifully shot scenery and outstanding performances from the actors. Fiennes especially delivers a great turn as the love struck 'hero' as does Binnoche as the nurse who tends the patients wounds. Full of great lines and stunning visual acting 'The English Patient' remains one of the finest British films ever made - and it just goes to prove they can make them like they used to.",9,1,3,28 September 1999
