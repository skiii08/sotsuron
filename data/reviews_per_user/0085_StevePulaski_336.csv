The King's Speech," We Shall Prevail
","I believe when a movie like The King's Speech comes out, and the Academy gets ready to take a vote on Best Picture, Director, etc, they immediately pick this because of its story and its very serious tone. Some movies that get nominated for an Oscar have no chance of winning. Winter's Bone had no publicity, The Kids Are All Right, no publicity, Toy Story 3 had the animation category in the bag so that wasn't going to happen and so on.The real competition was between The King's Speech and The Social Network. I wanted The Social Network to win, but knew right after this one would take it. Do not get me wrong though. The King's Speech was a very well made film. But both The Fighter and The Social Network were stronger and more entertaining than this one. There was more excitement. That's not to say The King's Speech wasn't entertaining. It had more suddle excitement than other films it was competing against.The story is that King George V's son Albert Frederick Arthur George (later known as King George VI, played by Firth respectively) had a stammering problem where he would fumble words and the stammer would increasingly show and worsen when frustrated, mad, or upset. George sees an Australian Lionel Logue (Rush), speech therapist to try and improve his way with words. The United Kingdom is in trouble and scared about World War II approaching. They desperately need information and direction from George. He can't give direction, if he has a stammer. He needs to be relaxed and at ease, which is a big struggle.I have been questioning a lot to myself if Firth really deserved the Oscar. It was a tough year for Best Actor. Who to give it to? Franco was great in 127 Hours, Wahlberg punched and kicked his ass off in The Fighter, Jesse Eisenberg and his tech geeky self consumed me in The Social Network, and I haven't seen Biutiful or True Grit to judge Bardem and Bridges' scenes. Personally, if anyone deserves the Oscar the most, I think it's a toss up between Firth and Wahlberg. It's hard to stutter, but to be British and stutter is even harder. But to box efficiently and effectively is hard in a movie as well.The King's Speech is directed well and deserved the Oscar for the category and the costume design and musical score is composed to perfection. It doesn't feel forced, it feels relaxed, even at its most stressed moments. The story of King George VI still amazes me to this day that someone with such a bad speaking problem lived on to be a great and exceptional ruler. It truly is a remarkable story.There are points where the film is taking it slow and the voices tend to simmer. The dialog is soft, you need to listen, and sometimes you might find yourself drifting in and out of the film's storyline. But you immediately get sucked back after being in lala-land for a few seconds.George's speech We Shall Prevail is breathtaking and utterly leaves you speechless. The power in his words and his soft voice really strikes you buy surprise and may leave you questioning somethings. The King's Speech is delightful and inspiring, but still is a questionable Oscar win.Starring: Collin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, and Helena Bonham Carter. Directed by: Tom Hooper.",9,0,0,10 May 2011
The Benchwarmers," A bench best left cold
","Clark (Jon Heder), Gus (Rob Schneider) and Richie (David Spade) are middle-age, hapless geeks who have constantly been belittled and treated like second-class citizens just because they're uncoordinated, socially and athletically inept, and overall anemic and soft. One day, on the baseball diamond, they stand up for a young boy named Nelson, who is similar to the men in the way that he always seems to be a target of embarrassment and the butt of every joke. After defending him and proving worthiness by winning a baseball game, the three men are approached by the boy's father, Mel (Jon Lovitz), who wants to assemble a baseball team called 'The Benchwarmers,' which consists of one nonathletic soul after another. The men bite and make a bold attempt at trying to live up to Mel's standards, whatever they may be.Unfortunately, writers Allen Covert and Nick Swardson do not make a bold attempt at making The Benchwarmers a creative, funny comedy. At a paper-thin eighty-five minutes long, I counted two small laughs and maybe a smile, which is far, far too unsubstantial for a comedy in this day and age. It doesn't help that it tries to tackle the incredibly difficult comedy act of slapstick, which I'm beginning to wonder if that form of comedic talent was buried with Chris Farley in the late 1990's.A large part of the reason that Benchwarmers fails as a farce and as a satire is that, for one, it capitalizes on humor that is monotonous and immature. The second part is it's a failed satire on players that are actual benchwarmers in their own leagues. Instead of presumably giving a film to relate to, the writers find it much easier to sneer at their attempts at succeeding and their earnest passion for a game they may not be good at.The film was released by Happy Madison, a studio I've long been at odds with when it comes to reviewing their films. Adam Sandler, the company's founder, often makes films where he puts the audience in the unruly position of laughing down at the characters and making them either incredibly unlikable or just not very interesting from a human standpoint. Not even interesting in the sense of being comedy vehicles. The result with Benchwarmers is three popular comedians doing work that should be written and performed by second-rate improv actors. Not these names. And don't get me started on Nick Swardson, playing Richie's brother, a sheltered albino with an uncompromising fear of the sun and the outside.On a final note, this was directed by Dennis Dugan, the director, or perhaps victim, of many Sandler films in the 2000's. Even though I can't immediately recall a film directed by him and pioneered by Sandler I've liked, I can say that this won't be the first one I think of when I think of his worst pictures. After all, in 2006, I'm sure he couldn't foresee the film he'd later get tangled up in, like Just Go With ItYou Don't Mess With the Zohan.Starring: Jon Heder, Rob Schneider, David Spade, and Jon Lovitz. Directed by: Dennis Dugan.",3,0,0,1 June 2013
Moneyball," 'An island of misfit toys'
","'There are rich teams, and there are poor teams. Then there's fifty feet of crap. And then there's us' Billy Beane coldly states at a meeting early in Moneyball. Beane is the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, which in 2002, were the lowest-salaried MLB team, that began their season with eleven loses in a row. If it hadn't been for Beane's devotion to the team and the excellent crew working alongside them, the team may have likely spiraled down to become one of the worst performing teams in MLB history.Beane (portrayed excellently by Brad Pitt) was recruited as a player to the MLB at a young age, and after failing to drum up much attention, was assigned the A's GM in 1998. After losing to the New York Yankees in the 2001 postseason, Beane continued to seek out other options, hiring the Yale-educated Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), working as an assistant for the Cleveland Indians at prior to this, to work as the numbers-cruncher for the team. Brand quickly pulls up a list of 'misfit players' that should be going for a higher price, but are ostracized because of their quirks. Even on a limited budget, they recruit a number of lesser players and went on to compile a team that would win twenty games in a row, the highest winning streak of any MLB team in history.Moneyball closely examines Beane and Brand's tireless game with numbers, how both of them faced opposition from the A's manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman), and despite being overwhelmingly successful at the game, Beane's constant dissatification with the team as a whole, even saying that winning twenty games is meaningless unless you win the final game of the season.The one person he continues to keep close to him is his young daughter, Casey (Kerris Dorsey), who becomes increasingly worried about how her father could do so much to help yet remain mostly unmoved by it all.Writer Aaron Sorkin pens Moneyball with a rare side of cynicism not only from Beane but from the sport of baseball itself. The complexity of the game is stunning, the statistics sometimes brutally unfair, and the stress and anguish of it all, unfathomable in every sense. I rarely attend major league baseball games, and usually stick to the humble, but sophisticated Midwest League when I am hungering for baseball. I'm sure the stress is there about as much as it is in the bigger ballparks as well.Sorkin, who penned The Social Network just a year prior to this, continues his streak of taking a questionable premise and making it interesting, informative, completely understandable to anyone regardless of interest or education, and shows the importance of slick, flowing dialog from character to character.Moneyball is a wonderful work of supreme intellect, on a subject that more often than not spawns a by-the-numbers story. Pitt is increasingly favorable as Beane, Hill works wonders with the dramatic screenplay, and Hoffman brings yet another fabulous performance to the table in his string of successful ones. And even when one of those three are not taking screen (which is a rare occurrence), we still get wonderful, stylistic visual flair. This film has it all.Starring: Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill, Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Directed by: Bennett Miller.",9,2,3,8 September 2012
The Avengers," Six heroes, one challenge
","Remember how last year we were met with an unusual abundance of superhero flicks focusing on heroes that seemed to have come out of nowhere? It was all buildup to Marvel's The Avengers, one of the most anticipated films of 2012. This is the first time I sought out a superhero film in theaters. I usually don't see them because I've never cared for them. They're not my kind of thing.This is the Freddy vs. Jason for superhero fans. The story goes like this; after Nick Fury (Jackson), leader of the agency S.H.I.E.L.D., discovers that an energy source by the name of Tesseract has opened a portal allowing Thor's brother Loki (Hiddleston) to use the source's ability to control the minds of people, he calls together, 'The Avengers.' They are The Hulk (Ruffalo), Iron Man (Downey Jr.), Hawkeye (Renner), Captain America (Evans), Thor (Hemsworth), and Black Widow (Johannson), only two of those characters never got their own film. Isn't that something? Captain America can get three, Iron Man can get two, with an upcoming third one, and Hulk can get two non-related works within the same decade, but Black Widow and Hawkeye get the cold shoulder? Guess no one wants to pull another Green Lantern.The first hour of the film is not-so-much devoted to character development, as much as character interactions; how do heroes react to being a room with other heroes? There's a nice feeling of uncertainty amongst the crowd, and we get the feeling these heroes are intimidated by the presence of possible competition. The feeling of inferiority is always lurking.Director/writer Joss Whedon, whose subversive horror film The Cabin in the Woods is also currently in theaters, has two great things going for him right now. One, he speaks to the world of fandom and nerdom, and never disconnects himself from this sort of medium. You can see he likes these heroes, and he tries to imagine how their interactions and conversations might've gone on the pages of a comic. And two, he knows how to devise a brutal, relentlessly intriguing third act that never relapses. I'm not the biggest fan of hardcore, lengthy action scenes, but the half-hour to forty minute brawl in The Avengers didn't bother me, mainly because I realized Whedon wanted to showcase all the different possibilities that could exist if six superheros fought against one destructive villain.Not to mention, how difficult it must've been to construct a film where six different heroes come together for the first time. Whedon has the task of mixing the patriotism of Captain America, the shameless cynicism of Tony Stark, the demigod-abilities of Thor, the subtleties of Hawkeye, the wise-remarks of Black Widow, and the anger of the Hulk into one coherent film. The result is superb, commendable, and utterly terrific. Each character, too, gets their own time to shine, rather than some going unsung and others fighting to get in front of the camera in a 'look at me, ma!' sort of fashion.In the mix of all the violence, talking, and scientific jargon, occasionally, comes a nice sprinkling of humor and wit. Most of the humor comes from the wise-ass Stark, whose comedic timing and infinite possibilities may lead me to seek out Iron Man and its sequel.Marvel's The Avengers may appear to be another superhero flick, just with more heroes and less villains, but it's the effort that shines through the material. The effort, determination, and challenge of combining six different heroes was definitely something to overcome, and Joss Whedon (who is by no means a newcomer, with a resume comprised of the Television shows Angel and Buffy the Vampire Slayer) has made an explosive mainstream debut, with a film that dripped potential. This is a kinetic and stylistic piece of work from a man, I believe, just getting started.NOTE: Just to fuel the tired joke of Black Widow and Hawkeye never getting their own picture, anyone else anticipating the Ant-Man film in 2014? Starring: Robert Downey, Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston, and Samuel L. Jackson. Directed by: Joss Whedon.",9,1,4,5 May 2012
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," A film that needs to be justified before it can be praised
","I've made my lukewarm opinions about 'The Hunger Games' film franchise rather apparent in my reviews of the last two films. While being enjoyable for a short period of time for their action sequences during the actual games and the appeal of Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss Everdeen, the previous two films have always found a way to include some sort of feature that prevents me from giving them positives reviews. The first film was burdened by mediocre direction, which felt almost constantly off balance or unsteady in its videography, and the second film found itself including too many hokey sequences before descending into tiresome survivalist action.'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1' is the first of the two part finale to this series, and can effectively be summed up as a two hour trailer for the second part. Being a film conducted in two parts, the first part is inevitably setup for the second part, which will undoubtedly be the climactic part of the two films. With 'Mockingjay' being only ten pages shy of four-hundred, splitting the film into two films over two hours in length is a questionable decision. Taking a book that is already questionably long enough to sustain two parts and making the first part a dreary plod through exposition and talky setups is enough to make me lose the limited amount of appreciation I had for this franchise.The film sees Lawrence reprise her role as Katniss, and reminds us of how Katniss destroyed the annual Hunger Games and essentially left her home of District 12 in ruins. After being relocated to District 13, Katniss, suffering from severe flashbacks and trauma, is recruited by President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore), a rebel leader, who wants to use Katniss as propaganda for a potential civilian unrest. On top of this newfound gig, Katniss is also trying to rescue Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) from the capital, who have taken him prisoner. Katniss blames old District 12 victor Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) for Peeta's capture, who promised to save him before her. The film follows Katniss's many battles with what seems to be some type of post-traumatic nightmares, her fragile emotional state, and her gig as a propaganda figure for the potential capital uprising.For starters, any outcries of praise for Katniss being a dominate and strong-willed female character should dwindled to faint muffles after the complete character reversal we see occur in this film. Katniss, who has always been something of a clichÃ© of herself or, at very least, an archetype, has no resorted to being a character who whines and cries powerlessly with every event. Never do we see the same determined and incorruptible force of a character we saw in the previous films, who is innovative and selfless, but instead one who is far less interesting and cursed with a weepy and fragile ego.On top of that, we get dreadfully boring exposition in the way that talks about the rise in propaganda in Panem. What could've been rich with commentary unfortunately finds itself remaining stagnant in terms of simply existing and providing little payoff. Scenes involve Katniss, Coin, and a gaggle of other characters talking about potential civil unrest in the districts before we see Katniss having another traumatic nightmare inside a hospital, desperately crying out for Peeta. The film keeps circling itself in this manner, and it doesn't help that Lawrence, who, as I've said before, is a gifted actor when she's playing human characters in realistic environments, handles the emotional scenes with an evident element of overacting that neither intensifies or captivates but instead finds ways to offput.The contents and existence of 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1' will be justified by the devoted fans of Suzanne Collins' book series as necessary for a complete adaptation, to which I do not disagree; we need elements of setup and narrative articulation not only for clarity but so the climactic parts can succeed on greater, more emotional levels. The issue is we don't need two hours and a separate film for the events, and what perhaps could've worked out at least adequately results in nothing more than a blatant cash-grab for a franchise Lionsgate clearly doesn't want to only be worth three films.",4,20,32,24 November 2014
"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Like a drag show, this film has an unnerving amount of confidence
","Few films tackle the gay/lesbian genre with such flamboyant and outrageous tendencies, but The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert manages to be one of the genre's rarities. It's an uncommonly free-spirited film, bound by nothing and restrained by no one, with a writer/director who clearly understands and empathizes with the subculture and a cast committed to giving it the respect and the zany fun it deserves.We focus on Anthony Belrose (Hugo Weaving), who uses the drag pseudonym 'Mitzi Del Bra' and works in Sydney as a performer for Lasseter's Hotel Casino Resort in the remote town of Alice Springs. Anthony, despite success at Lasseter's, hungers for something more out of his life and his performances; he's sick of being belittled to 'get naked' or show skin when he's pouring his heart out on stage before the microphone. As a result, he rounds up his colleagues Bernadette Bassinger (Terrence Stamp), a transsexual performer and Adam Whitely (Guy Pearce), a younger, more obnoxious soul who goes under the stage name 'Felicia Jollygoodfellow' to embark on a four-week tour through the Australian Outback in their large RV named 'Priscilla.' Classic road trip tropes ensue the second this eclectic trio embark on their journey. The three find a group of Aborigines, whom have never seen the art of drag performance, along with a group of rednecks that nearly have them lynched for intruding on their territory. Along the way, the gang gets equal parts feisty and sentimental with one another, getting on each others nerves at times and finding solace in one another for at least empathizing with their desire to be understood and respected for what they do.The Adventures of Priscilla, in order to really succeed as a film, needed to occasionally capture human emotions through a tender, sentimental lens and Elliot perfectly delivers it without the violins and the overblown emotional manipulation. He gives us a lot of time to spend confined with this trio on Priscilla before the emotions take over. He starts off lighter, peppering the film with bouts of wittiness (when the three harmonize the drinks they want in tune of 'Twelve Days of Christmas') and light-hearted fun.The first leg of their trip about the goofy, somewhat hostile conversations they can have with one another. The second leg of the film is when most of the antics kick in and we see the trio's interactions with other minority subcultures, who choose to respond to the three in whatever way their own culture has perceived them (either openly or narrowly). Finally, the final leg of the film takes the aforementioned introspective look into these characters as human beings, with their own sense of idealism for themselves and the people around them. This is when The Adventures of Priscilla becomes a bit sadder, but never forgoes the element of good-natured, consistent fun.Aside from the conversational banter being a real hoot, Tim Chappel and Lizzy Gardiner's Oscar winning costume design is almost a character in itself. Chappel and Gardiner bathe the film in an exciting, eye-popping array of flamboyant color schemes and loud tones and hues that make for a visually delicious experience. Brian J. Breheny's cinematography also lends a hand to making the Australian Outback a lively character, accentuating every detail of the land in a way that makes the excursion that much more enjoyable. All the background devices in the film are precise, which makes The Adventures of Priscilla not only an interesting character study but a royal feast for the eyes.The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert also features some of the most compelling and uproariously funny work from Pearce, Stamp, and Weaving, three veteran character actors who continue to expand their horizons with the variety of roles they take. With all of this, there is a general showstopping quality to the film that stems from all its aesthetic attributes and central performances. Like a drag show, the film steps out with a bold, unflinching amount of confidence and persists to exploit every ounce of entertainment and humane element that it can handle and, in turn, delivers terrific entertainment for most of its runtime.Starring: Terrence Stamp, Hugo Weaving, Guy Pearce, and Bill Hunter.

Black Swan," The strive for perfection ends in devastation
","Reading reviews of Black Swan online made me come to a logical consensus; you either love it, or hate it. There is really no in between. If so you're leaning to one side. The film is definitely an art film. I saw a poster for this a while back as it proudly displays it's selected showings at The Toronto Film Festival and Venice 2010. Once I saw those two little messages on opposite sides of the poster I knew that one, this was a serious film, and two, it's likely to get some Oscar nominations. Junior film critic intuition.Black Swan was nominated for Best Picture, Best Actress (Natalie Portman), and Best Director. Sadly, it found itself a bit neglected compared to hefty competition with The King's Speech and The Social Network. At least Portman was recognized for her unique and thrilling role as Nina Sayers, a ballet dancer working at a stunning academy in New York City.The director Thomas (Cassel) chooses Nina to be the white swan in the retelling of Swan Lake. Nina is thrilled to have the job, but she feels held back and forced into a box she can't fit into by her controlling and strict mother (Hershey). Nina's mom was an aspiring dancer, but failed to get to the level of fame and is now forcing her daughter to do what she couldn't do. She clearly wants the best, but not in the right way.The pressure but on Nina is relenting and makes her have strange, unexplainable hallucinations and anxiety levels of high calibers. She is almost on the verge of going insane. She strives to be perfect, but at the same time she's up on a pedestal her mom and she herself know she can't live up to. It's a sad state of affairs for this poor women.The cinematography and especially the music is extraordinary and very vibrant. The score is gripping and is easily the best soundtrack composed for any film in 2010. Natalie, excuse me, Oscar Winner Natalie Portman gives an electrifying performance and documents the struggle will full seriousness. She had that Oscar in the bag before the nominations came out.Mila Kunis is brilliant here as well. I have called Kunis an amazing woman of beautiful looks and now I can call her one of beautiful looks and major talent. Not like she didn't have talent before this film, she just never got to showcase it like she did in this film.Director Darren Aronofsky knew where he wanted to take Black Swan - above and beyond expectations. It's a film not only worthy of the Best Picture win, but a movie that should've had a wider release and more mainstream promotion. The acting, the screenplay, music, lighting, plot, etc is outstanding and some of the best 2010 has to offer.As for 'the scene' with Portman and Kunis I wasn't all amused or aroused. I'm not a fan of lesbian sex scenes in any film. Horror, comedy, or melodrama it isn't the kind of thing I like to watch. The film Bitch Slap was great exploitation, but the continuous lesbian love scene was too long and almost soiled the film and what it had going for it. While it's not meant for the reason it appears, Black Swan knows when to start it and when to stop it.When it comes to ballet movies, the few and far between, there are only a selected number of people who like ballet let alone the ones who want to see it on film. I admit I probably never would've seen Black Swan if it wasn't up for nominations. But I was attracted to the film when Kunis's name appeared on the poster, but could never find a theater near me that played it. I didn't even know the plot to the film and still was interested.The less you know going into see Black Swan, the better.Starring: Natalie Portman. Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel, and Barbara Hershey.

The New World," The intensity is there, but the focus isn't
","At first glance, one could say Terrence Malick, one of the most respected directors in Hollywood, is now trading his personal take on movies and taking a shot at one of the most famous American stories. Well - when one hears the plot to The New World, the latest film by Malick, we can clearly see he chose to focus on the myth of John Smith and Pocahontas rather than the actual story. But, even though this story has been told before, it is told through the eyes of an incredible man.The history and trivia following The New World, I must admit, is better than the film itself. The story for the film was written in the early seventies, but due to financial setbacks it wasn't until 2005 would it see the light of day. This is Terrence Malick's fourth film in over thirty years, cementing the fact that he takes time and effort to perfect his stories.He tells the story of Captain John Smith, played by Collin Farrell, an English explorer who makes the famed 'Jamestown Expedition' with his crew and stumbles upon a village in Virginia in 1607. Smith, Captain Christopher Newport (Plummer), and the other crew-mates are met with a Native American tribe. Though she is never referred to by name, Pocahontas (Kilcher), is the main character from the tribe and the film begins to tell the fictionalized romance between Smith and Pocahontas, while including the incredible fear of being around an unsettling group of people from both points of view.While this story is going on, we get amazing shots of grass, water, rivers, birds, the sun, the skyline, and the wildlife depicted in such an exquisite nature it is almost breathtaking. The highest point of the film is the beautiful, enriching cinematography. Malick is known for bringing the setting and the beauty of the land to the foreground of the picture rather than leaving it as many film-makers do; a scenic backdrop only occasionally brought into full focus. The enticing images make up for a film that lacks in greater fields.Because this is Malick, the story is non-linear and very jumpy. This worked for his latest picture, The Tree of Life, because it was a simpler story and one from his own mind. With The New World, the story of Jamestown is a little harder to follow for many people, and it doesn't help matters that the film can hardly stay focused on its characters. The story is still told with clarity, but because of the quiet dialog (which sometimes can literally be incomprehensible), the sluggish pace, and the awkward narrations, it feels like the film is making itself harder to watch and harder to focus on.Sometimes, I'd be lost for several minutes staring aimlessly into the backdrop of the scenery. Since it's the prime focus of the film, I don't think Malick would be ashamed to hear that. But the lack of clarity in the story, and the constant drifts from scenery to storyline do make the film a chore to follow at some points. Not to mention, the film runs already lengthy at a one-hundred and thirty five minute runtime. Because of the story and the artsy feel, it feels every bit as long as that and sometimes longer. The original cut is nearing three hours which I honestly can't believe. I had a hard time sitting still the final half-hour of the shorter cut.The acting is one of the strongest points in the film, however. Collin Farrell's role as Captain Smith feels not acted but every-bit as natural as it was meant to be. Christopher Plummer, whose narrations in My Dog Tulip were fantastic, gives a great performance here as well. And you can't leave out the extraordinary work of Q'orianka Kilcher as the teenage Pocahontas.Because of the time of release, the story itself, and the eclectic man at the camera, New Line Cinema will clearly be struggling to make their money back from The New World. While I'm still getting used to Malick, and the fact that stories from past the 1800's don't quite pull me in so fast, I can't be considered the normal reaction for a film like this. I recommend this to strict Malick fans, but also see fans of history and the Jamestown Expedition enjoying the film quite a bit too. For me - this was a fairly lengthy journey, but it wasn't a lost cause.Starring: Collin Farrell, Q'orianka Kilcher, Christopher Plummer, and Christian Bale.

Antz," A communist fable? That's not so far in left field...
","Antz is a notable film for three distinct reasons. One, it ushered in a whole new kind of animated film for children; dark, stylish, very adult, and usually appreciated by a certain type of child. This isn't necessarily the story believe would possess mainstream appeal by a public treated to the wonders of Toy Story and a previous slew of Disney films. Two, it bears a darker and more stark animation style that breaks free from the cuteness of other animated tales. And three, the explicit controversy that lead to this film's creation.For the 'Cliff Notes' version of the story, Jeffrey Katzenberg, an executive at Disney, departed the day Pixar/Disney head John Lasseter pitched the idea for A Bug's Life, a charming little computer animated feature centering around the rodents of your backyard. Not long after Katzenberg departed, he formed 'Dreamworks' and his debut feature would be Antz, focusing, likewise, on an insect-drive society, released seven weeks before A Bug's Life. Lasseter was greatly disheartened by Katzenberg's move, which was easily the case of taking someone's great idea and using it against them. Which one became more well-known? At the time, I'd most likely say A Bug's Life, but both films have gone on to be sort of the forgotten creatures of two massive companies. Yet Antz is more than meets the eye in several regards.We focus on an ant colony in New York City where ant Z-4195 (voiced by Woody Allen - whose character is also nicknamed 'Z') is gridlocked in an oppressively totalitarian society where individualism is discouraged and conformity is king. As neurotic and somewhat inept he is, he hungers for the opportunity to express himself in a land dominated by conformists obeying the order of the ruling class. 'Z' befriends Princess Bala (Sharon Stone), the daughter of the ruling queen ant, who takes a liking to his quirkiness, but recognizes he is merely a worker ant and not a noble soldier ant. To impress her, 'Z' sneaks into the soldier march and is quickly taken for a ride to defend his ant colony. Yet he overlooks the fact that General Mandible (Gene Hackman) is purposely shipping out the loyal troops to die so he can formulate his own society filled with goon-like ants that talk with incredible power. The whole thing escalates into an integration of not only the plot of rebellion and survival, but romance and possessing a non-conformist attitude.The voice acting will without a doubt turn off some people, but there are so many terrifically cast people in this film that sink into their roles fittingly. Woody Allen comfortably sinks into his role as a neurotic worker, Gene Hackman is brilliantly cast as the villain, Sharon Stone works as the princess, and Sylvester Stallone and Danny Glover exercise their roles to a pleasant extent.Visually, as stated before, this is one of the darkest animated films I've seen - one of the very few not to be dominated by eye-popping, candy-coated colors while being soaked in a nice innocence that's easy to swallow. The message is strong and versatile; don't settle for conformity, but branch out and do what you want to do. Go against convention, do noble acts, do something that doesn't put you in a line occupied by faceless others. Some people have said Antz is a communist fable and I whole-heatedly agree. It shows in detail a society of shameless totalitarianism and exploits how it robs people (or ants in this case) of their individualistic qualities and personal traits.Antz is primarily targeted towards the ten and up demographic, but I can see slightly younger kids appreciating this for its charming convention-breaking roots and its enigmatic presence it unleashes on its viewers. Dreamworks would later become known for implementing this kind of style, where it would ditch the younger crowd demographic in favor of the tweens and teens still cool enough to see animated films. Needless to say, with their immense success with the Shrek and Madagascar franchises, they've had quite the lucrative success. At the very least, this is a footnote in the world of animation, not just for its successful cast but for its darker themes and appearance that contrast it from the typical animated film.Voiced by: Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Sylvester Stallone, Danny Glover, Jennifer Lopez, Christopher Walken, Anne Bancroft, and Dan Aykroyd.

The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Were my bonds really infinite? Am I a wallflower?
","I have sat through more droning, idiotic, ridiculous teen comedies in my day than some of you can imagine. I've seen films with kids attempting to get their entire school high on marijuana, one about a girl modeling herself after coming of age dramas, one about three kids throwing a party that gets a little out of hand, one showing kids stealing the ACT answer-sheet, another about a group of skaters pioneering their bold techniques, and the list goes on and on redundantly. Seeing all of those films, individually, at a point in my life, I took away nothing of significance and assumed that the genre was predominately dead and in search of a new voice.Dear reader, Stephen Chbosky is that voice and his gospel is shown in The Perks of Being a Wallflower, an uplifting, engaging, and entirely complete picture, but even that isn't doing it proper justice. No matter what I say, I can't help but feel I'm oversimplifying its inherent greatness. It's terrifically compelling because of its direct approach to the ups and downs of high schools, and features exuberant characters who are anything but quirky caricatures we see as humans rather than archetypes. Chbosky may be an adult, but he hasn't lost sight of the true fluctuating nature of American high schools, which sometimes seem to be more a competitive battleground than a learning facility.It's difficult for me to dub The Hurt Locker a realistic film, fore I have not been in combat and do not have close connection with those who have. As an active high school student, this film is heavily realistic, right down to the reading material the English teacher gives the students. The plot concerns Charlie (newcomer Logan Lerman), an introverted freshman about to slog through 1385 days of high school with no friends and no true life direction. He's had his run-ins with mental illness, frequently blaming himself for the death of his aunt, who was killed in a car accident on her way to get him a present. To illustrate his fears and internal thoughts, he pens a letter to an unknown friend, so as not to concerns his parents.Soon, he meets the class-clown Patrick (Ezra Miller) and the artsy Sam (Emma Watson), two Seniors, who are step-siblings, that spend their time listening to indie music, making mixtapes, or attending low-key parties. The three strike a notable bond based on their taste in music and unique view on the world, often considering themselves 'infinite.'Wallflower predominately centers on the relationship between Charlie, Patrick, and Sam, showing them at their most confident and most vulnerable. Writer/director Chbosky, who also penned the novel this film is based on giving him almost entire creative control (nobody has any right to say the irrelevant and meaning phrase 'the book was better than the movie' here), tackles a wide variety of topics. Topics that include mental illness, homosexuality, introverted behavior, relationships, loose friendships, erratic relationships, mixed signals, depression, etc. One must not forget that this is a teen film, so many of the problems had by characters in other films are repeated here, yet that is perfectly with me. Very, very rarely do they play these issues for laughs, and Chobosky's firm grip on the characters and their personalities, allowing the audience to connect with them on a very intimate level make this a picture to simply treasure. And besides, I'd rather watch a serious film about real, but common issues had by teens rather than a comedic film about a niche problem that doesn't take itself as seriously as it wants its audience to.The performances should be unanimously cherished for their authenticity and power that bring this material together. Logan Lerman does terrific work as Charlie, bringing emotion to his character not in a way that feels manipulated and robotic. Ezra Miller, who accentuated pure evil and remorseless malice in We Need to Talk About Kevin, is spontaneous comedic relief, but so darkly serious and honest at times in his portrayal it's physically crippling. And, as expected, Emma Watson is fantastic as the leading female role, especially because she forgoes the anticipated idea of her being the pretty longer with no friends but a big heart. She is a brave, enigmatic soul who is simply trying to discard the past in search of a brighter, more opportunistic future. The side characters are great, as well, including horror-makeup icon Tom Savini as the shop teacher, Paul Rudd as the English teacher, Mr. Anderson, who begins to form a relationship with Charlie (one I would've liked to see explored more), and Joan Cusack, although do not expect a performance of more than two minutes.This is beautiful filmmaking in every sense of the phrase, sure to register with the crowd who recall their high school days and those who are simply sympathetic and empathetic to the current generations' wallflowers. The hardest emotion to achieve or communicate in cinema, in my opinion, is empathy. It's easy to recognize a similar situation you've been in while the character goes about his routine in the same way you did, but do you genuinely feel bad for him or truly feel for his problems? Do you remind yourself he is entirely fictitious, therefore, no real emotions should be felt? I sat in awe as I was presented with raw and unpredictable brutal honest about the labyrinth of high school and regarded my previous years deeply, contemplating decisions, friendships, and the 'unbreakable' bonds I formed. Were they so infinite? Am I a wallflower? Such questions should be considered for much longer after the closing credits end. This is the smartest teen movie of the new decade.",10,1,2,13 February 2013
10 Cloverfield Lane," You are now free to move about the bunker
","'10 Cloverfield Lane' is a unique specimen in 2016; here's a film that comes out on the heels of very little marketing buzz, so much so that only a sentence-long plot synopsis was made known to the public, minimalist trailers that, unlike most, do not air before every new release in theaters, and a week of screenings that have had many critics tight-lipped about what the film actually is. When I first heard the film was going to be released, I had to try not to shrug it off and assume it would be a mediocre, loosely connected followup to the 2008 smash hit 'Cloverfield' that's main goal was quick cash.However, after the thirty minute mark of the film, I knew I was in for anything but a cash-in, let alone a film that was trying to be a followup or a continuation of the world set forth by the aforementioned film. '10 Cloverfield Lane' not only takes the series into an alternate direction, but completely revitalizes its formula by creating a Hitchcockian-style mystery that is predicated upon heart-racing tension and immaculate aesthetics that are often so crisp and consuming, you might have to remind yourself that you're not the one trapped in the film.Being that '10 Cloverfield Lane' is one of those films where, when describing it, there is a vague line between what is spoiler territory and what is part of the basic plot outline. To keep things decidedly simple, the story opens with Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), driving home on a long, secluded road after a fight with her boyfriend, before she is involved in a devastating car accident that sends her flying off the side of the road. She eventually wakes up in an underground bunker and meets Howard (John Goodman), a dedicated survivalist, who rescued her from the wreck and claims that this is the safest place she can be following 'what happened.' Howard informs her that a devastating attack has taken place outside that has left nearly everyone dead or contaminated with some sort of disease; the size, scale, and cause of the destruction is unknown due to the radio-tower being knocked out. In preparation for an event like this, Howard has taken the precaution of designing this underground bunker like a home, with a shower, toilet, Television set, a full kitchen, and food supplies to last years if rationed. Also in the bunker with them is Emmett (John Gallagher, Jr.), a friend of Howard's who remembers when he was constructing this bunker. Howard will also not let Michelle nor Emmett look onto the outside world through windows without his permission, leaving the three without any contact beyond the walls of the bunker.This kind of premise just breeds claustrophobia and fear and '10 Cloverfield Lane' is a masterclass example of such. Using some fascinating cinematographical tricks (employed by Jeff Cutter) that showcase the cramped environment of the bunker, in addition to some beautiful, sweeping long-shots in such a tight space, both Cutter and first-time director Dan Trachtenberg create an environment that startles and mystifies. The trio of screenwriters (Josh Campbell, Matt Stuecken, and Damien Chazelle, writer and director of the fantastic 'Whiplash') are smart to keep us, the audience, just as trapped as the characters in this film. We don't know more than they do and we're put in a position to buy or reject Howard's simultaneously incredulous but believable story of doomsday.In addition, the sound design in this film is layered and cut-throat, not so much heavy on the jump-scares or the abrupt synthesizers that work for a good jolt, but in terms of adding to such a congested area where every sound is ostensibly amplified to ear-shattering effect. This makes every effect and auditory accoutrement to '10 Cloverfield Lane''s beautiful cinematography resonate that much more, and makes for a slowburn, suspense-driven delight.Finally, let's please talk about John Goodman's career-making performance in the film, as he broods but never settles for empty fear. His gravelly, almost guttural voice makes each syllable that rolls of his tongue feel like a sucker-punch to the jaw, and such a blow lands right on the exterior of Mary Elisabeth Winstead, who is anything but a passive force of abuse in this film. Winstead's strength and power as a leading woman is communicated throughout the film, and she proves to a public that has slept on her despite strong performances in 'Grindhouse: Death Proof' and 'Smashed' that she's worthy of recognition. Only more likely to be slept on her is Gallagher, Jr., who does some damn-fine work as well, but sort of finds himself ostracized by the sheer power of both Goodman and Winstead.Again, I must emphasize the fact that '10 Cloverfield Lane' is a proclaimed 'spiritual successor' and 'blood relative' to 'Cloverfield' and not a direct sequel, prequel, or any immediately connected entity. This is probably for the best, as the pulse-pounding effects of 'Cloverfield''s found footage/shaky camera aesthetic have worn threadbare within the last eight years since the genre's revival. '10 Cloverfield Lane' goes for something different, more electric, layered, and scary, and the film manages to be one of the best mysteries in recent years.",10,2,6,11 March 2016
The Finest Hours," A film as easy to dismiss and forget as a wrong number
","While 'The Finest Hours' is by no means the dreary, ostensibly never-ending mess that was last month's 'In the Heart of the Sea,' it's by no means even close to matching the quality of 'The Perfect Storm,' one of the best swashbuckling films of recent time. This is another by-the-numbers Disney film, that turns an incredible true story into a series of shortchanged and theatrical instances of peril that has numerous studio executives crossing their fingers, hoping it will somehow lumber its way to be a huge financial hit in a season when few films of more than average quality are out.If all of Disney's eggs are in 'The Finest Hours''s basket, as I'm sure they aren't but just for the sake of argument, then it simply shows what this time of the year really does to Hollywood. There's nothing fundamentally nor glaringly wrong with 'The Finest Hours' other than it's a painfully average, uninteresting slog that does so very little to assure any kind of practical methods were taken to really get to the heart of the helpless characters and those brave enough to embark on what seemed like nothing more than a suicide mission.The film revolves around Bernie Webber (Chris Pine), a member of the Coast Guard stationed in Massachusetts on Cape Cod. Bernie's duties are pretty laidback, until the same day he plans to ask his commander Daniel Cluff (Eric Bana) for permission to marry Miriam (Holliday Grainger), the girl of his dreams, he is ordered to guide a lifeboat and a small crew to rescue the S.S. Pendleton. The gigantic ship has just broken in half after getting caught in a violent nor'easter off the coast of Cape Cod, and Bernie and his three-men crew have to figure out a way to track down the ship and rescue as many or all of its thirty-two passengers.This is exactly the kind of remarkable story that we would be calling implausible had it not been based on a true story (same goes for films like 'Argo' and even 'Trumbo'), and because of that, it's a film that was ostensibly going to be a bit alienating from the start. The reason being is that when you have a film telling this extraordinary of a story, if you don't make the film about the characters, or at least confine the setting and the focus where it appeals to basic human emotions and practices, such as connection and survival, it's going to feel cold and empty. 'The Finest Hours' doesn't go for the survivalist route of 'All is Lost,' showing its characters at their most helpless and hopeless, nor does it opt for spectacle as it revolves around two developed characters like in 'The Perfect Storm.' What's left for 'The Finest Hours' to do is produce a simple, well-shot action film that does a good job at giving us a chronological timeline of the Coast Guard/Pendleton rescue back in 1952, but nothing else. There's no staying power thanks to thin characters, and there's few enticing or memorable action sequences because we're too often cutting back and forth between what is occurring on the water and Miriam's constant worrying over her husband (in yet another vague and almost entirely worthless female role), providing for desperately little continuity.The film was directed by Craig Gillespie, who seems to be one of Disney's go-to directors for basic live-action entertainment that makes caricatures out of characters and makes the factual seem like the overblown (Gillespie also directed 'Million Dollar Arm,' another almost instantly forgettable film). In a month when films have ranged from the average to the barely tolerable, perhaps it would've been better for 'The Finest Hours' to downright suck because it would've given me a better, more exciting review to write and a funnier, more relevant review for you, dear reader. Instead, I feel, much like a captain of a ship when all is going well, on auto-pilot as I reflect on a film that is about as easy to dismiss and forget as a wrong number.",4,26,54,31 January 2016
The Longest Yard," A Division II comedy
","One could call The Longest Yard remake one that was bound to happen and play more as a hilarious comedy rather than a dark, gritty picture. While there are some dark elements conveniently scattered throughout the film, it is safe to dub this an Adam Sandler comedy. Again, I'd rather have it succumb to this instead of one of Sandler's 'anti-character studies,' but we won't even go there.This is a remake of the Robert Aldrich film of the same name from 1974, but that note will undoubtedly have little importance to modern audiences. Sandler has taken the film and pretty much revamped it into a modern day take on the underdog formula. He plays Paul Crewe, a selfish former football player who was immediately blacklisted after 'shaving points,' or in simple terms, purposely not covering the point spread on a given game. Crewe has become a careless louse, and after a recent run in with the law from stealing his wife's car to getting into a high speed chase on the freeway, he must do three years in the big house.Crewe is harassed by Warden Hazen (Cromwell) to join the football guards' football team in prison, and despite his decline of the offer, he is manipulated into doing so by Hazen's threat of adding five years to his sentence for false accusations of attacking Captain Knauer (Fichtner). He rounds up his team of misfits including his close friend, nicknamed 'Caretaker' (Rock) and the gentle giant Switowski (Sapp), along with the legendary coach Nate Scarborough (Reynolds). At first, everyone seems to be rather hasty of the idea, until they learn the prisoners will be facing the guards and perhaps get some much needed anger out of their system.Something I noticed almost immediately; the film is abnormally cast, meaning a lot of actors you wouldn't think would be in a comedy football remake do a pretty commendable job. Most notably Chris Rock and very underrated rapper Nelly, who also wrote the song 'Here Comes the Boom' especially for the film. The song is easily more memorable and impressive than the picture itself.Sandler does a decent job, and the script seems rather potent and lively, at times almost having too much fun with the formula. My immediate problem with the film is this is more of a by-the-numbers, textbook take on the underdog football formula. Scenes of long, droning, and cliché training take place, not to mention the inevitable tragedy the team will face just before the big game and sporadic gay jokes litter the picture.What rather elevates The Longest Yard is its quick comebacks and its unlikely talents utilized in the picture. It's nice to see the film pay respect to the screen legend Burt Reynolds, and even feature a well-composed collection of songs, but the film, as a whole, is long, dry, and conventional, and it winds up being a Division II take on Division I material.Starring: Adam Sandler, Burt Reynolds, Chris Rock, James Cromwell, William Fichtner, and Nelly. Directed by: Peter Segal.",7,0,1,31 May 2012
50 First Dates," Sandler shows his third alter ego
","50 First Dates is Sandler experiencing with the romantic genre, while slightly tilting it towards the dramatic side, with an essence of comedy. It tells the heartwarming, if not mildly depressing tale of a Marine Biologist who falls in love with a woman who was in a car accident, and suffers from short term memory loss where her memory is wiped clean the next day.She can still remember everything that happened the day before her accident, but she is unable to remember anything that happens in the present for more than a day. She is stuck living in what, she thinks, is October 13. The woman is Lucy, played by Drew Barrymore, and the Biologist is Henry, played by Adam Sandler. Despite her current state, Henry is head over heels in love with her, and desperately tries to make things work between them by constructing a scrapbook for her to read every morning, a tape to watch, and by having her father, Blake Clark, and brother, played by Sean Astin, who drops the funniest lines in the film, try to tell her everything about him again and again.If a condition like this really existed, in the film it's a merge between short term memory loss and amnesia, the question is who would it be harder on? The person who has to suffer it, or the relatives who must deal with it. In the film, it shows the father and the son of Lucy going through the same daily phase of rearranging everything from repainting the wall they let Lucy paint to refilling the shampoo bottle. It just so happens that October 13 is her father's birthday, so they have to go the trouble of reliving it over and over again.The story is charming, yet some of the comedic elements are a little out of place. The film has more characters than necessary, and tends to get focus more on them rather than furthering Sandler and Barrymore's wonderful chemistry. Adam Sandler's best friend is played by Rob Schneider, who is not funny at all in the film, and the 'Alexa' character whose gender is never disclosed is an unnecessary and ridiculous distraction.Also, the film seems a bit distended from the idea of this condition. Is this supposed to be cute and funny, or a serious and saddening? There are times when the film pokes fun at the illness (IE: 'Ten Second Tom'), and there are times with Lucy where feels genuinely serious. It's almost like Sandler is saying, 'yeah, it's sometimes sad, but c'mon, how do you not laugh at it?' With those quibbles being said, I can still say 50 First Dates is a great change of pace for Sandler. It's the second Sandler film I have really enjoyed, with the first being Funny People, and, at the rate we're going, will probably be his most sincere. If this is the best we'll get than so be it. I can live with that.If I can compare old Sandler with new Sandler, it's easy to broadly state that his new films are humorless failures, but 50 First Dates is like the better version of one of his more recent comedies, Just Go With It. In Just Go With It, Sandler was playing a similar character; he preyed on young women just to get them in bed before abandoning them blind. Later on, he met a woman who he really did care for, pretended to be married, and still acted like a selfish, uninspired cad while putting on a nice guy face. Here, he is genuinely sincere, and not snarky and underwritten like his future character. We really go on to believe he cares about this young girl.The ending is probably the saddest, yet most optimistic conclusion to any Sandler film yet. It appears to be happy, but when closely examined there's still a layer of sadness under it. Director Peter Segal, who directed the fun farce Tommy Boy (which is briefly referenced here), tightens his strings a bit to bring us a warm and simple drama with some characters we like and others we wish were shifted a bit out of focus. 50 First Dates isn't perfect, but it shows that Sandler is capable of doing a mostly serious role, and doesn't need to incorporate his two famous alter egos; the BIG, strong tough guy or the little, weak baby.Starring: Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore, Rob Schneider, Blake Clark, and Sean Astin.

The Hangover," What took them so long?
","In a sea of comedies that are absolutely humorless, idiotic, and ones that only have their moments every hour, The Hangover stands out as a fresh piece of the modern day world of comedy. Obtaining the top three status for most successful R rated films, this film reminds us that with the right mix of characters, a cute story, and some highly eventful antics, comedy films can still be made like they used to be.It's the day before Doug's (Bartha) big wedding, and before making a lifelong commitment, his friends Phil (Cooper), Stu (Helms), and Alan (Galifianakis), the soon to be brother-in-law of Doug take him out on a Bachelor Party in Vegas. They toast on the roof and next thing they know, they wake up hungover, their room destroyed, a tiger and a chicken in the livingroom, and they must figure out 'what the hell happened last night.' The best part is, they lost the groom. So Phil, Stu, and Alan must search the entire Las Vegas for Doug while piecing together the events of the previous night.The true fun of The Hangover is the fact that the fun comes from the events in the film. The characters try desperately to find their friend, but so many unexplainable events keep popping up and interfering with their plans it's hysterical.You can tell when a comedy is trying to hard to squeeze laughs out of its audience. Some work, some don't. With The Hangover, the first time you see it, you will laugh a lot. It's consistently funny. There is never a dull moment. All four actors have great chemistry, and we wind up actually caring about their fates, not just watching them unfold with no emotion.It plays like a hazy detective story where we know only as much as the characters. Normally in movies, we get a side story of others, or the movie will give you hints to what will happen. In The Hangover, we go from their final moments alert, to when they wake up in their hotel room. We know nothing of the events last night. We have to wait for them to uncover the events.The character that delivers the most laughs is easily Zach Galifianakis's character. Sweet and simple Alan has tons of quotable lines that are maybe far too quotable. The Hangover will most likely do to Galifianakis's career what Animal House did to John Belushi's. He has now became a household name, and will likely be compared to his role in The Hangover if he does future comedies. Hopefully he'll do one very serious drama film to show he is multi-talented rather than being the charming simpleton in all his movies.Because of all the buzz, The Hangover was dubbed 'overrated' and 'not funny' by many who saw it late. I saw the film around the time of release. Hearing nothing about it and just getting out of school, I was in for a positive movie. I just expected a few good laughs and all around, a decent movie. What I got was a wonderful comedy with heart, humor, and a huge rewatch value.Starring: Ed Helms, Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, and Justin Bartha. Directed by: Todd Phillips.",9,1,3,30 May 2011
Iron Man 3," The ship should be docked by its original captain
","Early on in Iron Man 3's lengthy, long-awaited production, director Shane Black stated he wanted to make a film that wasn't superficial or self-serious, but rather, more fun and lighthearted. I would've went with serious; Iron Man 3 is, to say the least, a disappointing conclusion to a franchise that showed amazingly potent promise with its awe-inspiring debut just five years ago. This is a been-there-done-that affair that does exactly what I praised its original film for not doing; serving as a special effects compilation and incorporating much more humor than necessary.Perhaps that was the foreseeable effect of having Black take the director's chair over Jon Favreau, who manned the ship on the first two productions. Black, whose fame stemmed from the 2005 cult hit Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, throws way too many cutesy witticisms in his writing, treating the third installment of the Iron Man franchise as the byproduct of a self-referential film treading the likes of Seven Psychopaths. Not only does putting this side-by-side with the original two films, which weren't as dark or as heavy as Nolan's Batman franchise but still rather serious, seem a tad out of place, but the series feels like it's more concerned with nudging and winking at the audience than wrapping things up cleanly.We are thrown back in the futuristic world of Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), only this time, we start in 1999 at a New Year's Eve party where scientist Aldrich Killian tries to bring up thoughts and ideas about expanding his company to an cold, uninterested Stark. He is quickly-shifted out of Stark's mindset, never to be seen again any time soon.Fast-forward to the present and we see Stark's battle with the aliens in New York (events from The Avengers) have made him jittery and a frequent victim to panic attacks. Just in time, too, since the elusive terrorist Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) is threatening America's safety and Killian (Guy Peace) returns to exact revenge on Stark for his narcissism and arrogance. On top of this, he must ensure the safety of his long-suffering Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and continue emphasizing that he will protect the citizens of the United States from uncertain danger.There is far less going on in the third installment of this series than there was in the second film; whether or this is good or bad, you can be the judge. Black doesn't play it safe, but he sometimes only slightly opens doors before closing them abruptly, a little bit like what Iron Man 2 did in the face of the government wanting Stark to hand over all his technology to the Defense Department. The ignored idea that we could've got a lot out of is when Stark's pal Rhodey (reprised by Don Cheadle) tries to convince him to refrain from instigating or provoking Mandarin in anyway and saying leave it to the government. That is when Iron Man's role in social order and political uprising should come into play but sadly never does.I, too, can't help but feel that if you were a fan at all of the original Iron Man comic books that if part two let you down part three will considerably let you down. Mandarin is drastically shortchanged as a villain, not given too much backstory and only given certain times to chime and spit villainous clichés. Killian, as well, although the film sort of explains why in a twist ending that I find a tad more disingenuous. Clearly, he is played as some sort of Osama Bin-Laden-esque terrorist, but we know far too little about his motivations and plans. He is evil and wants to take over, case closed.Another subplot features Ty Simpkins as a young boy named Harley, who connects with Stark on a personal level in certain points in the film. Harley is a well-meaning kid, kind of irritating, but genial and relatively harmless, and often the victim of Stark's narcissism as are many of his close friends. Harley isn't a bad character, but he's an unneeded addition to the story. His story offers little-to-no payoff and, in the end, plays as sort of a little piece that tries too hard to tug at the heartstrings.It's honest to say that the Iron Man series has gotten a tad bit worse since its start in 2008 with a very promising film that I consider one of Marvel's strongest films to date. Its sequel, while crowded with subplots and characters, still found a way to get its energy and heart in the right place and at least tie things up marginally well by the end of the film. The third film features yet another wonderful performance by Downey Jr., a briskly-paced narrative, and interesting little minor inclusions along the way, but gets too caught up in the sense of its own whimsy and personal delight with its humor. At this point, the fans deserve an 'Iron Man 4' just for the sole-purpose of optimism that it will be better, more efficient than the two sequels we got.NOTE: My video review of Iron Man 3, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqz0INZADww Starring: Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce, Don Cheadle, and Rebecca Hall.

Marie Antoinette," Maybe better if was a bit more in-depth on The French Rev.
","While Marie Antoinette is beautifully directed and acted, there is somewhat of an annoyance that goes through my mind as I watch it. It could be the fact I'm not into many period pieces, or just the fact that the film is a bit slow it doesn't matter. Marie Antoinette is a glorious look at the 17th century France, and how they reacted to a foreign queen leading the country.The film doesn't go into The French Revolution too much which is a shame. I could see a violent and gruesome film rise from those ashes. It's a shocker no one has made a French Rev. film in quite sometime. I'd like to see a $70 million film on bloody beatings, rage, and hatred for the government. We just got a taste of that in Egypt not too long ago.The plot focuses on Marie Antoinette (Dunst) as she moves into Versailles at the age of fourteen and becomes Queen of France five years later. The film is a pretty accurate description of her life, and that's about the extent of the plot.One of Marie's biggest problems is she came from Austria, and is a foreigner to the French community. She's treated unfairly and it's almost like she is the uncool girl at school trying desperately to fit in and be accepted by her peers. What she went through seemed tough, but by the end of her ruling when TFR gets into high gear it becomes more her and Louis' fault as she starts to bring the blame on herself.Kristen Dunst gives a beautiful performance her. She pretty much always looks her best in the film, and is a very attractive women throughout. The attention to detail on France, the costume design, the characters, and pretty much everything is pristine, and it does it's best to look like it was in the 17th century. It achieves at that goal.What Marie Antoinette really has going for it is it's ravishingly gorgeous costume design. I mentioned the attention to detail is pristine, but the costumes are just simply breathtaking. It's Oscar worthy material in the Art Direction field.Marie Antoinette was directed by Sofia Coppola, the daughter of the director Francis Ford Coppola. Sofia does a pretty nice job at adapting this story to film, but her film before this Lost in Translation, I found, to be more entertaining. Marie Antoinette achieves at being a well documented film on the life of Marie, but doesn't seem as good as it could've been. If maybe it started later in her life and went on into The French Rev. it could've been more respectable, but regardless, it's still a film with beautiful people and costumes. I can give it that.Starring: Kristen Dunst, Jason Schwartzman, Judy Davis, Rip Torn, and Rose Byrne. Directed by: Sofia Coppola.",8,0,1,7 March 2011
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Heartbeat, excitement, exhilaration, and determination
","If there was ever an action movie that loves other action movies while succeeds at trying out new things for a change it's definitely Raiders of the Lost Ark. This is a classic, unforgettable, and a truly fantastic adventure film that completely blows others out of the water. Just in the opening scene we are treated to delightful cinematography, impressive effects for the time, and a nail-biting setup combined with extraordinary music to foreshadow the string of events that will soon follow.Indiana Jones is a compelling character, from the way he looks and talks, but just the way he fights. Every move he makes seems well thought out and genuine rather than just constant instincts and 'think-fast' scenarios. He is produced by Lucas, directed by Spielberg, and played extremely well by Harrison Ford.Action films nowadays have no real story. It's usually about a sentence in length. The same can sort of be said about Raiders. It centers around Indiana Jones , an archaeologist who usually goes on risky, death-defying adventures to try and recover ancient artifacts. The US Government hires him, one day, to go in search of the Ark of the Covenant. His mission, that he chooses to accept, is to find the ark and return it to the government before the Nazis uncover it.Right off the bat, this story transforms into a globetrotting adventure. Indy teams up with his old flame Marion (Allen) and it becomes clear that he is more concerned with finding the ark than drumming up another relationship. A beautiful dodge to a cliché so commonly used. The main villain is a man in a black cloak named Belloq (Freeman). He is involved with some of the most gripping action scenes in the film, most notably the one in the bar.The special effects, at least now, appear to be a bit cheesy. We currently live in an age where we can build anything our heat desires from the ground up on CGI. Still, in Saturday morning serials, clearly the feel Spielberg wanted to capture, special effects are supposed to appear a little hammy. I'd take Raiders's action sequences over incomprehensible, score-driven scenes of peril with monotonous digitized backdrops we are so used to today. I'd also take its music, suspense, cinematography, buildup, and characters over anything today as well.Raiders of the Lost Ark is an ecstatically giddy adventure film with one jaw-dropping scene after another. It captures the age of films we'll probably never see again. The age where everything was done for a purpose, and adventure scenes actually played like an adventure. This has the right amount of developed story and the right amount of exhilarating action scenes to be considered the perfect and most satisfying adventure film ever made.Starring: Harrison Ford, Karen Allen, and Paul Freeman. Directed by: Steven Spielberg.",10,1,2,21 January 2012
Casablanca," Worthy of a title so few films have
","NOTE: Casablanca begins my four-month long movie watching series simply titled 'Film Studies,' where I provide reviews of all the films I have watched in my semester-long film studies class in my senior year of high school. Reviews will not be read aloud in class unless otherwise stated below, at the end of the review.I've stated in previous reviews how difficult it is to review a film regarded as 'one of the best ever made' or a classic because it would appear from constant analysis, its permanent mark in the minds of millions, and its loyal following that everything that could be said about the specific film has been said again and again. My thoughts on Casablanca aren't atypical or contrary to the public's consensus on the film. It's a bold picture with a lot layers and an engaging romance story all around.The film concerns American expatriate Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), who owns and operates a nightclub in Casablanca which has now been considered a haven for French refugees ('no one really lives in Casablanca,' so the saying goes). People gather at this nightclub in hopes of purchasing 'letters of transit,' which will allow refugees to leave the area and flock to America. One day, out of the blue, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) and his wife Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) show up to Rick's nightclub, much to Rick's surprise, as Ilsa is one of the only women he has ever fallen in love with. Ilsa, from the start, is a beautiful, almost angelic woman with incomparable charisma and beauty. Upon her return, Rick must question if he still has feelings for Ilsa, as does Ilsa, all while remembering that Victor does have the ability to get her to safety in America.Like many films of its time, Casablanca was made, released, well-received but, at the time, thought of as just another drama made in the wake of another world war. It wasn't until the war ended that the popularity and the great reception of Casablanca began to flourish and expand before the film earned its place as one of the top American films ever made one of the reasons for this, I believe, is how many angles from which one can view this film. It can be seen as a morality tale, a romance (both which I find to be the strongest ways to see the film), an allegorical picture with Rick representing America's neutrality during the time of the war and Ilsa representing France as a country tempting to sway the U.S. in one particular direction, or as a period piece with only a handful of characters.Moreover, I'm instantaneously reminded of one scene in particular whenever I think of Casablanca and its true emotional power that scene comes later in the film when the French national anthem is sung in a room full of refugees, many of them French, who authentically show emotion due to the entire scene being an act of improvisation. The shot of a young woman bawling in part nationalistic pride, part shock hits right in the soul.Something must also be said about the black and white photography in the film, which is purely utilized to generate an effect and an emotion on the viewer. Consider the scene where Ilsa attempts to get through to a clearly weary and slightly drunk Rick. Director Michael Curtiz fixates the camera so that both characters can be seen, but the left corner of the screen, where Rick lies, is darker and bleaker than where Ilsa is, which is the top right part of the frame. In Ilsa's corner, it's brighter and the lighting alludes to a more optimistic feeling. This is a brilliant example of doing the difficult task of capturing two moods in one single shot.Intricacies like that, the beautiful chemistry between Bogart and Bergman, the harsh morality at the center of it all, the controversial ending, and the immensity of emotions is why Casablanca is regarded as such a classic picture.Starring: Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and Paul Henreid. Directed by: Michael Curtiz.",10,1,2,1 October 2013
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Put this on a penny and spend it
","I'm all for titles that spawn preposterous reactions and incredulity among the public, but Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter's begs 'notice me.' It is so strangely concocted, with a noun and an adjective strung together with little to no connection, that it demands you see it. The film takes one man's bestselling novel and gives it the seventy million dollar+ Hollywood treatment, and by the end, it doesn't walk out entirely gutted, but with some limbs missing.That's right, this was a novel, but I'm sure that fact is seldom known by the public. After weeks of seeing the trailer in theaters, for many different films, reactions were always different, yet there was always spry laughs coming from some audience members. A friend of mine stated, 'I doubt that was what the director was going for.' I disagree, as it brings me back to the incredulity part I was talking about. The idea is so strange, so cockamamie, and sounds so hilarious that while you're laughing, you're hiding the fact you want to see the film. An intelligent marketing plan if you ask me, but execution beats marketing intelligence.Benjamin Walker, who looks impeccably like a young Liam Neeson, jumps into the shoes and suit of our sixteenth president, and is holding a monumental grudge against Jack Barts (Marton Csokas), the man who poisoned his mother. When Barts informs Lincoln he is an immortal vampire, the bearded man is taken under the wing of Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper), who tells him that he can teach him to become a skilled vampire hunter. Along the way, the man reconnects with an old African American boy he grew up with and Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), the women who would eventually become his wife.Director Timur Bekmambetov has taken the Tim Burton approach (who unsurprisingly has a credit on this picture) to the film and has given a dark and eerie look to it. Seeing it in 2D, I can't imagine how dingy and foggy the picture must've looked in the third dimension, what with the muted colors that are already muted and the loss of brightness when there is almost none to be lost. The cinematography, and of course, Benjamin Walker's brave performance as an ax wielding Lincoln, are the two things the film can offer before the premise begins to catch up with us.This is a film that was better an idea, or possibly a novel, than a one hundred and five minute picture. To begin with, it has an immensely pompous attitude towards this 'vampire' premise, when really, its goal should be to achieve campiness and not a long-lasting impact on people. Brief escapism if you will. The whole picture neglects to recognize its absurd, revisionist ideas and treats the film as a masculine period piece established on modest obscurity. The film isn't modestly obscure but fully obscure, and it's unclear whether Seth Grahame-Smith (the writer of the film and the novel) wants us to laugh at it, although he makes very little attempt at black humor, a feat that would've been welcomed with open arms by myself, or if he wants us to sincerely care about it.There is a scene early on where Barts and Lincoln are fighting in a field, where CGI horses are racing pasts at stunning speeds. They are dodging, weaving, and carefully slipping under the horses' bodies for a good three or four minutes before Barts picks up a full horse and throws it at Lincoln like it's nothing. The film needed more ridiculous scenes like this, rather than monotonous action set pieces. The final sequence, involving a speeding train on a burning bridge, works great, yet, still occupies that unnecessary level of indulgence.As far as an impact on the audience, it seems the only thing Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter will succeed at is having a legion of internet users creating immature, mildly amusing, childlike SNL title/video parodies featuring other famed political icons. As a film itself, it is a cute idea, blown up on the big screen in a strangely pretentious way. Audiences are likely to appreciate the absurdity of it all, but if not, there's always the cult following business...Starring: Benjamin Walker, Dominic Cooper, Anthony Mackie, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Rufus Sewell, and Marton Csokas. Directed by: Timur Bekmambetov.",6,2,4,23 June 2012
Meet the Parents," A very serious, relatable story squandered
","Is there anything more nerve-wracking or heart-racing than meeting your significant others parents for the first time? This seems to be more of an obvious fear for the male in a heterosexual relationship than it is a woman's; the desire to make a presence that's simultaneously meaningful and respectful, but not too brazen, is a tricky dance to accomplish and the anxiety that accompanies such an event is usually too much to even begin to adequately articulate. One winds up overthinking everything to the point of either saying something they didn't mean to say or feeling like they have just made a complete fool of themselves in front of the person they love and her own family.I suppose I can rest easy knowing that writers Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg have made a 'worst case scenario' film about the subject, which effectively makes almost any evening spent with the parents of your significant other seem desirable and successful in comparison. Jay Roach's Meet the Parents is the kind of film that takes those fears and persistent worries and etches them into a film that ups the stakes so high that, after a while, it becomes difficult to laugh given how far the film has fallen from its own sense of realism. it takes a realistic and common fear and repeatedly throws so many incredulous situations towards it, turning it into a farce, that, by the end, it's not only hard to take the film seriously, but the characters as well.We meet Gregory Focker (Ben Stiller), a male nurse who has been in a relationship with Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo) and is working to execute the perfect marriage proposal as soon as he gets off work. Just before he's about to pop the big question, Pam gets a call from her sister that she is now engaged, right after her fiancée asked Pam's father for her hand in marriage. While Pam claims it isn't necessary to do such a thing, it's a sweet, traditionalist gesture. As a result, Greg keeps his plans under the wraps and agrees to go to Pam's family's home in Long Island for the wedding.Upon losing his luggage on the flight, Greg meets Pam's father Jack (Robert De Niro) and her mother Dina (Blythe Danner). Right off the bat, Jack is cold and offputting to Greg, emphasizing Greg's less-than-positive view of cats and his own career choice of being a nurse. This sets the tone for what will be the next few days - awkward, uncomfortable interactions that will revolve around Greg trying to please Jack, but, in the end, only resulting in frustration or anger on Jack's behalf. Things only get intensified when Greg winds up meeting Kevin (Owen Wilson), Pam's ex-fiancée who is helping organize her sister's wedding.Meet the Parents has a committed cast of greats, starting with De Niro and Stiller, the two obvious, and even making strong uses of Polo and Danner, who transcend supporting roles and have a few of their own moments to shine. Consider Polo's character consistently trying to tow the lines of loyalty to her father and express her love for Greg, while Danner's character's cheeriness is usually diminished by the sternness of her husband. The glaring effects of the male characters on the female characters is an interesting dichotomy, especially seeing as the female characters are the whole reason everyone is brought together.Other than that, and some surface relatability based on the basic premise of the film rather than the actual details, Meet the Parents is one long sitcom. The film houses a barrage of overblown sight gags, caricatures instead of characters, and a case of 'maximum antics, minimum laughter,' where the writers continue to dogpile awkward scenarios on the characters while forgetting to humanize the characters in order for the gags to actually work. This is less a film and more an assortment of asinine events that work to beat the audience down with slapstick and a great deal of comedy that is almost too desperate to be funny.Meet the Parents will get empathy points from many, but the points it receives from its obvious brand of comedy should be relatively minimal. There's an appalling lack of human interest here outside of the film's concept, which is a big problem when you have a film that has the ability to resonate very deeply with people. Many of us have been in Greg's situation and many of us have found ourselves to be the worst enemy at times, but these elements, while substantial and ripe for exploration, can even be taken in a haphazard manner.Starring: Ben Stiller, Teri Polo, Robert De Niro, Blythe Danner, and Owen Wilson.

The Big Lebowski," A Good Comedy With Iffy Rewatch Value
","The Coen Brothers already made a name for themselves after the release of their film's like Raising Arizona, Barton Fink, and most recently Fargo in 1996 at the time. So when The Big Lebowski came out I'm sure they were all over this film. The film is in no way bad, but it's definitely a movie that isn't for everyone. Besides the strange characters, the plot is equally as weird and is a little hard to elaborate. But really, the film is one to laugh out loud too. Both leads in this film are portrayed fantastically and are very funny when on screen alone and simultaneously. Bridges' character 'The Dude' is one of the best characters in any Coen Brothers film.When it comes to Jeff Bridges, I don't know a lot. I do like him for his underrated role he played in K-PAX, but this is only, I believe, the second film I've seen with him. He's great at doing a Comedy film. When he gets into character with the LA slacker accent he can be a thrill to watch. He drops some funny one liners in this picture and is also accompanied greatly by John Goodman who plays Walter. When the duo appear on screen the laughs keep coming and coming and the humor rarely lets up.The plot involves an unmotivated slacker nicknamed 'The Dude' (Bridges) demands Jeffrey Lebowski (The Big Lebowski) to give him a new rug after his was urinated on by two robbers who were looking for a person by the same name as 'The Dude's' (Jeffrey Lebowski). His request is declined but he is contacted again when Lebowski's trophy wife is kidnapped and after a series of events The Dude and Walter must return the ransom in order to get the wife back.The Big Lebowski isn't really my type of film. The Coen Brothers never were my type either. I was never really into their films and am into a much more different tone of Comedy. This Comedy, while being well done and funny, is also a little bit of annoying too because of how long it is. The movie could be trimmed around maybe twenty minutes in my opinion. It doesn't need to span close to two hours. Sort of reminds me of Dinner for Schmucks how it almost runs two hours to say that since it's long it's better. Not true for any movie.One of TBL's high points are the character performances by John Goodman and Jeff Bridges. Both characters are insanely funny and very amusing to watch on screen as well. I am really fond of 'The Dude' character and he throws in very amusing and clicking lines in the films as well. I enjoyed the end scene and the way the movie ended too. I guess what I'm trying to say is that The Big Lebowski has ups and downs, but really, it's a movie you need to try out. It may not be for everyone, but it does have it's share of humor.The last thing I need to say is this is a film I don't think I'd watch again. Various films I've reviewed recently I've went back to and rewatched again for the hell of it and some movies I even watch for an occasional third time. Naked Fear I've watched once more since I reviewed it and I gave Eve's Beach Fantasy another try and couldn't make it through the first ten minutes. I don't know if I can watch this film again just for the hell of it because I believe I got the full entertainment value the first time around. While it's well made, I'm sure I'll come back to it in later years, but not anytime soon, but clips I can assure you will be revisited. The Big Lebowski is a highly enjoyable film. While not being what I expected, it still had a great cast and various scenes with lots of humor. I think I can say, it certainly does abide.Starring: Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, and Julianne Moore. Directed by Joel and Ethan Coen.",8,1,7,10 October 2010
Fight Club," Broke two rules writing this, but it was worth it
","Fight Club's tagline is probably one of my favorites and boasts a great question in the world today; 'how much can you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?' Never being in a 'true' fight, I suppose I, myself, and a lot of others don't know their physical strength, their limitations, and abilities under the given circumstances in a real scuffle. When will you call 'uncle?' When will the anger consume you? When will you bleed out? Let's not talk about it.Being requested by many people to watch this film, why I put it off is something I can't answer. I believe it was because I feared since the film is filled with morals and very subtle messages I would not 'get' most of it. Out of the countless number of morals Fight Club spat at me, I took two and would like to share them.The number one thing I took out of Fight Club is that men have become sort of 'softies' in the world we live in, and many no longer sport the 'tough as nails' image women mistake us for. Here we have an insomniac who loses direction in life, becomes what some will call 'insane,' and escapes to an underground fighting club where men beat the living hell out of each other for absolutely no reason, no questions asked. I think it's because beating each other to a pulp makes them feel like they still sport this image, and that they haven't gotten soft. They can take a lot of damage, unnecessary and necessary.The other thing is sometimes the worst enemy can be your best friend or yourself. Writing a spoiler free review of this film is difficult, and explaining this moral without stating an example is hard as well. I really don't want to give anything away just to explain the moral I picked up, so I won't. Just go into the movie with that in the back of your mind.On with the plot, our main character, also the narrator, is played by Edward Norton. He remains nameless throughout the entire film, and works as an automobile company employee. He suffers from serve insomnia, often having trouble dictating what is real and what is fake. Director David Fincher describes his character as an 'everyman.' To cope with his insomnia, and forbidden any sort of treatment from his doctor, the man continues to visit support groups. He does this to feel better about himself, and to witness others with more serve problems. He is an impostor at every one of these groups, and creates a fake name for each.Another impostor attends these groups named Marla Singer (Bonham Carter) much to the dismay of our narrator. They talk to each other and work out a deal so that their presences at these groups don't coincide with one another.On a flight home from a meeting, the narrator meets Tyler Durden (Pitt), a soap salesman. They talk at a bar after the narrator returns home to find his apartment in flames, and Tyler forces the narrator to punch him. They continue to fight in the back of this bar, with more people arriving everyday. They soon find a basement in a building they can use and establish their own 'Fight Club' to get away from society's troubles.Fight Club is scored very well, and its cinematography is beautiful. Why no Oscar nominations for the much deserved Norton and Pitt? Because of the film's extreme marketing. Disappointing in the field of criticism and revenue, Fight Club's trailers looked as if it were a film about a bunch of people beating the hell out of each other for no reason besides personal satisfaction. There is a market for those movies, but I'm pretty sure unless having read the novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk or reading up on the internet about this movie, people who went to go see it, were likely, not aware they were seeing a very smart and beautifully crafted film.Sadly, I was mislead upon watching this movie. So many people, including friends and reviewers on various movie sites, described the film as 'life changing' and many said it changes one's view of movies forever. It did none of that for me. It entertained me, and some moments I couldn't look away. Even at the most grisly times, Fight Club remains classy and stylistic. But it is no way life changing.But I can totally see how it did for some people. Some people enjoy the occasional 'mind-rape' style of filmmaking, a style that Fincher is very good at. They love making assumptions, hunches, and usually use large amounts of evidence gained from repeated viewings of some movies. Even video games like The Legend of Zelda have caused a legion of fans to take the world of the game very seriously. I don't have the time to do this, especially to this particular film. I can't see myself enjoying it more and more with repeated viewings. It was very enjoyable the first time around, but I feel the more I watch it the less surprised I'll be at certain events in the film that stunned me (IE: the scene with Lou).The on character relationship between Norton and Pitt is excellent, and can't be replaced at all. The various morals in the film are very well crafted and the movie tackles more genres than one may expect. It's a lot like Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. Critics deemed it 'dark' when it first came out, but lived on to become a classic. Fight Club took the same route. I'm sorry I delayed my viewing of it for so long.Starring: Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter. Directed by: David Fincher.",9,1,3,8 July 2011
Citizen Kane," Some will immediately say; 'No action? Worst movie ever!'
","This might be perplexing to some, but I wouldn't want a film I made to be dubbed 'the greatest movie of all time.' I wouldn't want it to be dubbed 'despicable' or even 'loathsome,' but I wouldn't want it to be labeled as the greatest motion picture ever made. With title comes untold expectations, and the problem with a title of this magnitude is it provides people the ability to make assumptions and expectations that a film simply can not live up to. I'm sure some have written off Orson Welles' Citizen Kane as 'boring,' 'overrated,' and 'stupid,' when really, if looked at from a technical standpoint and many other common film field, it truly is a masterpiece on film.Again, the question people will inevitably ask me I will not answer. The question will be 'is it really the greatest film of all time?' That question simply can not be answered. It's an objective question, and you'll never get an answer that isn't subjective. Poll everyone you know, it will still be subjective. I don't care if a million people label something 'the best,' because it still doesn't represent fact. It makes it widespread opinion. Citizen Kane, I don't believe, is the greatest film I've ever seen (not that I could say what is), but it is one of the most intriguing and important films I have yet to see.The story revolves around Charles Foster Kane (Welles), who is based off of the real life newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst. The film opens with Kane laying in his bed, gripping a snow globe, as he utters the simple word 'Rosebud,' and then the globe smashes seconds after he dies. Because of Kane's popularity, his death sparks mass attention, and reporter Jerry Thompson (Alland) is determined to decipher what his last word truly meant. The film winds up evolving into a nonlinear narrative, flashing back to when Kane was a boy, when he was growing up, and when he rose to fame.I can't see Kane being labeled 'the greatest film of all time' for its plot. For a film of that title, you'd expect a twisty plot that goes in every conceivable direction, leaving you breathless and somewhat confused. Not Citizen Kane. The story is pretty simple and the progression rather speedy. But there I go again with that 'impossible expectation' business.Where Kane really gets interesting is from a technical and intellectual standpoint. The film is the prime example of film noir, and the one cinephiles usually reference first. The use of light and shadow is very prominent in the film, and keep in mind, this was never done before. Some tracking shots are marvelous as they are complex and smooth. Everything seemed to be specifically planned out ahead of time, which is why the film doesn't feel rushed. Dialog was clearly perfected, shots were definitely practiced, and technique and stylistic intentions bleed through the storytelling. This makes Kane inevitably interesting and without a shadow of a doubt different. For the time at least.It is in this regard where people become massively disappointed. We have seen these same sort of tracking shots before, as well as having our perspective tricked, and light be the main focus in a film. It's nothing new. But for the time period this was revolutionary and riveting. It still is, personally. It is wholly consuming, incredibly enjoyable, and just all around fascinatingly complex.To add to the history lesson I'm reciting, the backstory on how this film came to be should award it some respect and recognition as well. Welles was big on the radio, airing the highly controversial War of the Worlds in 1933, and having major success in the field of theater. He signed a contract with RKO Pictures in 1939, where the studio gave him full control on a picture of his choice. He could write the script, choose the actors, and had privileges to edit the film to his own personal liking. This was such a rarity in a world dominated by studios. Newcomers were hardly given any room to maneuver, and when Welles had all of these privileges practically handed to him just because of minor past experiences, it really got people talking and what he delivered was beyond anyone's expectations. The film infuriated William Randolph Hearst so much that he threatened to have the film blacklisted and banned, which could partially be why the film received no Oscars other than Best Original Screenplay.Citizen Kane is a wonderful film that must be experienced. The history is one you can't ignore, the acting is superb, the storytelling, if a bit simple, is nonetheless engaging, the dialog is crisp, the music is lively and intelligent, and the filming and editing is nothing shy of entrancing and, literally, revolutionary. The moral also rings truer today than it probably did in 1941. Instead of feeling like you should enjoy it out of obligation, feel you should see it because of obligation.Starring: Orson Welles, Joseph Cotten, Dorothy Comingore, Everett Sloane, Ray Collins, George Coulouris, Agnes Moorehead, Paul Stewart, Ruth Warrick, Erskine Sanford, and William Alland.

Memento," She deserves vengeance, regardless if he knows or not
","Before Christopher Nolan began mixing the spectacle and the narrative device, along with the real show of characters and eccentric personalities. With the recent Batman franchise, Nolan became more about the darkness aspect of the story and noticeably amplified the action spectacle, but with his directorial debut Memento, he was all about the mystery. Memento is a great film mainly because of its element of surprise, mystery, and its narrative device. Nolan conducts the story atypically from the end of the story all the way to the beginning, focusing on an array of characters that may or may not have anything to do with the outcome of the story. But is the outcome the first scene (the story's conclusion) or the final scene (the story's beginning)? That is one of the many questions you'll ask yourself when watching Memento for the first time. Seeing it for the first time, I wasn't prepared for the constant mind-race I'd be experiencing. The plot should not be spoiled, so I'll give basic the story's basic framework. Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a man suffering from a memory disorder after a man apparently attacked and murdered his wife before knocking him unconscious. Now, Leonard wants to avenge his wife's death, but his memory loss makes it more of a challenge than it already is. Leonard can't hold onto newer memories but has all the ones prior to the incident. To keep with the information about his attacker, Leonard tattoos himself with crucial information in his search for the murderer and takes many Polaroids of the people he meets along the way.That's as far as I'll go in trying to sum up the plot. If you haven't seen it, you don't need to know much else. The story, being told backwards to forwards, intrigues and mystifies, as it should, and heightens the mystery of the entire premise. However, I question the impact the film will have with repeated viewings. Seeing it once and exploring the ins-and-outs of online movie-guides and analyses for Memento, I am seriously skeptical about it being as exhilarating and as gripping as it was the first time around.Despite my speculation of whether or not Memento will hold up for a second viewing, the film should be commended for its intrigue and intricate use of characters and story development. Sometimes the value of characters' motives - and characters themselves - are questionable, making the film tricky to piece together. This is not a criticism because it makes you connect with the stress and confusion of Leonard. The whole thing is akin to a hazy, vigilante/detective story. Nolan puts us in the position of Leonard so deeply that there's hardly a frame or scene where he isn't there. This gives us the feeling of confinement; the odd and often eerie feeling of embodying a character in a film.Guy Pearce's enticing performance only levies this. Pearce adds the hazy and disoriented qualities of Leonard's character subtly but effectively as she makes the character sympathetic but simultaneously unreliable. With Leonard's severe condition, even his buddy Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) sometimes seems like a complete stranger. This not only leads to an unreliable narrator, but an unreliable cast of characters, seeing as Leonard feels as if he can't trust his own friends and acquaintances due to his condition. The same applies to us.Memento is a great thriller thanks to its mystery and high-levels of intrigue. The great performances of Pearce, Pantoliano, and Carrie Anne-Moss as a woman Leonard meets during his search. The scene that rings in my head the most from the film is when Teddy informs Leonard that even if he does kill the person responsible, it isn't like he'll remember it. Leonard has the most logical response there could be. 'My wife deserves vengeance. Doesn't make a difference whether I know about it.' Starring: Guy Peace, Joe Pantoliano, and Carrie Anne-Moss.

Inglourious Basterds," From annoyingly isolated to cynically satisfying
","I do not consider Quentin Tarantino to be the godfather of auteur-driven cinema nor do I consider him to be one of the men who continue to 'ruin' it, so to speak. I consider him to be a director with a solid style, a talent for witty, eccentric dialog, a natural at erecting characters that we like for their quirky societal views and their strange talking points, and overall, the non-linear coherency of it all. What I like about Tarantino can easily be turned into what I do not like about Tarantino without changing a single word above. After viewing Grindhouse: Death Proof, Pulp Fiction, and Reservoir Dogs, I was convinced that the man was a breath of refreshing cinematic air; a man more concerned with the things in cinema that can easily create a wonderful cacophony of energy and spunk. But after viewing Inglourious Basterds, my enthusiasm for the man hasn't lessened but came to a stunning, unexpected trip back to reality realizing like many other directors working in the medium, the man is not perfect.Perhaps in the right eyes, Inglourious Basterds is a perfect movie. I suspect that everyone who will see it or has seen it has emerged with completely different viewpoints. That's the beauty of a Tarantino film, again, one person can like specific things about the film and love it for those reasons and another can point out those same little things and hate the movie just for that. Dissent is a beautiful thing, and it seems that's one of the many things that 'The Tarantinian Formula' intends to do.The film begins rather maturely as we are presented with a title card saying that the film is set in the Nazi-run areas of France, and then we see Colonel Hans Landa (also known as 'The Jew Hunter,' played by Christoph Waltz) arrive on a desolate country farm to meet farmer Perrier LaPadite (Denis Menochet). Landa is going around to different locations to try and find out if people are hiding Jews to protect them from Nazi persecution, and after a lengthy discussion with Perrier, the farmer informs Landa that he does in fact have Jews hiding in the house and Landa's goons immediately try to kill them under the floorboards of the house. The scene is particularly tense and gratifying, mainly because of its constantly unsettling nature and intimate shots, and serves as one of the best scenes in the film.From there on out, we are greeted with a number of other scenarios seemingly taken from all over the grid. Now we are three years in the future and see Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) giving a mean pep talk to his boys, eight Jews recruited to accomplish one assignment; to kill Nazis, or in Raine's southern, twangy accent, 'nat-zees.' Among Raine's crew is Donny 'Bear Jew' Donowitz (Eli Roth), a rather unnecessary, obnoxious caricature who is used as the violent soul of the whole operation. In a later scene, we seem him viciously beat a man's head in with a baseball bat, even after he breaks his neck upon being struck the first time. Certain scenes like that do not offend me, particularly, but I question their presence in a film dominated by dialog and sequences set in bars or elegant locations.Another subplot, arguably the most interesting, involves a German sniper (Daniel Brühl) striking a friendship with a young Jewish woman who owns a French cinema (Mélanie Laurent). And another subplot involves a German film critic named Lieutenant Archie Hicox (Michael Fassbender), who will become involved with a secret operation to bomb the premiere of the Nazi propaganda film the German sniper is a part of.Now that we've got the continuously twisty, absurd narrative out of the way, we have the content and the aesthetics to explore. For starters, one can not deny, this is probably the strangest work of Tarantino yet, drastically different from his previous installments, for the sole reason that it does not rely much on the things that I listed above. He breaks form, creating long, somewhat poetic dialog scenes to set the mood, rather than the cut-throat, bloody, unapologetic goriness the trailer promised us. The problem with Tarantino, which even existed in Pulp Fiction, a film I awarded a perfect rating of four stars to, is that once the man gets started, he doesn't know when to stop. Certain scenes become long and winded, many of them overstaying their welcome, and consistently thriving on repetitive, uninteresting chatter that obscures the purpose and the enjoyment one anticipates walking in.On the plus side, the film has some of the finest, rawest performances of the 2009 year. Brad Pitt gives a fine, no-nonsense performance as Raine, Eli Roth is capable as 'Bear Jew,' and Michael Fassbender, once more, is continuously wonderful in one of the many diverse roles of his career. Yet the highlight here is the merciless, unmatchable, truly divine work of brilliance done by Christoph Waltz as 'The Jew Hunter.' His performance alone elevates the film to the point where when he's on screen, we forget all the monotony and watery dialog we've just sat through.Consistent readers of my work will take note that I do greatly appreciate dialog in my films. But even I have a limit. There is enough dialog here to sustain two or three films, and that's a sign of a prolific, uncompromising auteur. If only the dialog had been easier to listen to, rather than just a good chunk of it being nonsensical, irrelevant banter would we have had some substantial meat to this story. This is a film that fluctuates from annoyingly isolated from its audience to cynically satisfying during a majority of its highlighting scenes. For a Tarantino fan, I can't expect they'll look for anything less.Starring: Brad Pitt, Eli Roth, Michael Fassbender, and Christoph Waltz. Directed by: Quentin Tarantino.",6,2,4,15 October 2012
This Is the End," A film lover's film
","This is the End does to raunchy comedies what The Cabin in the Woods did to horror films. It's a slick, subversive, wholly vulgar film that embraces its roots and emphasizes on the crudeness its actors are known to amplify. And amplify they do; this is one of the raunchiest films I've seen this year and also one of the funniest.This has been a bad year for comedies; there's simply no other way to slice it. Mainstream comedies suffer from the 'maximum antics, minimum laughter' formula, and all of them seem to take on over one-hundred minutes with only roughly fifty minutes of solid material. Just a few days ago I reviewed Rapture-Palooza, a dead-in-the-water comedy about the apocalypse and a young couple defeating the Anti-Christ. That film's obsession with vulgarity and raunchiness way senseless and gratuitous. It could be said that This is the End features vulgarity that is gratuitous as well, but it certainly makes better use of it and finds a way to incorporate the excessive swearing to great comedic effect. Rapture-Palooza did it in a way that felt like a group of twelve year olds that just found out a slew of four-letter words.The film's story is basic, but viable; it stars Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson (who was unfortunately victim to both Peeples and the aforementioned Rapture-Palooza this year, and Danny McBride who join James Franco's lavish home for a house-warming party. All the actors play simplified, egotistical versions of themselves as they party the night away along with many other actors from Michael Cera to Rihanna. Out of the blue, the Apocalypse sets in, sinkholes form, things explode, etc, and the group of actors find themselves stranded and left to fight for themselves in the face of chaos and violence.Many of us have likely seen some of these actors in other films. Seeing them all together, not playing characters, but themselves (regardless of how unrealistic they are) is simply a terrific concept. Similar to, yes, The Avengers, the large group of comedians joining each other on-screen feels welcoming and pleasant, but also slightly contentious as they seem to try and one-up each other constantly. Not to mention, they are a boiling-pot of narcissists, which shockingly works at the comic flame of writers Rogen and Evan Goldberg. I just hope we're laughing at stupid archetypes and not authentic portrayals.One catch with the film that didn't seem to be marketed in the trailer is that this is a film lover's film. This is a picture that is very self-referential and extremely satisfying to someone who has followed mainstream comedies in the last six or seven years. The references to movies past, the brought-up possibilities of sequels, the hilarious banter between cast members, and the terrific in-jokes only some of the audience will understand truly make this a fanboy's comedy. As someone who has paid close attention to comedies of the last few years - what with the huge rise and success of R-rated comedies that pack in hilarity and humanity - this was an enormous delight.And the talent certainly helps too. The always likable Seth Rogen and James Franco play terrific goofball stoners, the underrated Jay Baruchel does some great work with his outgunned/inferiority-conflict, Jonah Hill never disappoints as usual, Craig Robinson, finally, is recognized as the fun and lively comedic talent he is, and Danny McBride is simply hilarious in the role of the lame-brained slacker who can't do right. In addition, cameos by Michael Cera as a sex/coke addict and Rihanna are a laugh-riot.Ultimately, the excursion is rewarding and fun. Its two hour run time may seem flabby, especially considering when the Apocalypse starts to really ruin the lives of the main cast it becomes a bit humorless and redundant, but the dry sections are mere minutes while the laughs are uproarious and surprisingly constant. Directors Rogen and Evan Goldberg (writers/directors of Superbad) brilliantly hold their ground and balance everyone's comedic talent wonderfully. The entire product is light years more durable and serviceable than the average Apocalyptic-fare. I think the second people I'd want to spend the Apocalypse with besides my family are these guys.Starring: Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, Danny McBride, Emma Watson, Michael Cera, Rihanna, Aziz Ansari, and Kevin Hart. Directed by: Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg.",9,7,24,15 June 2013
Iron Man 2," 'Genius, billionaire, philanthropist'
","Despite the fact that Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is such an egotistical, relentlessly uncompromising man, he can't help but earn one's sympathy in Iron Man 2, the sequel to the overwhelming success that was Iron Man. Stark must deal with a Russian physicist named Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), who believes that he stole the complicated plans for his own personal Iron Man-technology from his father, his other arch-rival Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) who is establishing an gigantic uprising of metal monstrosities, and Congressional jurisdiction attempting to make Iron Man property of the Defense Department rather than his own personal technology. Talk about Atlas shrugging. On top of this, his company is now run by his longtime assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and his best-friend Rhodey (now played by Don Cheadle) may now become his sidekick to stop Vanko.Iron Man 2 is probably the most kinetic, fast-moving, briskly-paced sequel that could've been made to such a surprisingly elegant, intriguing film. Initially, with all this stuff going on, this sequel looked like it was going to follow the messiness and unfocused nature of Spider-Man 3, but director Jon Favreau manages to, for the most part, keep things moving steadily.I begin by reiterating the main element I praised in the original film and that is Downey's wonderful, wholly spirited performance as one of the most narcissistic males to take the screen in years. Stark is a tricky character to play, on one hand being a generous philanthropist and an uncompromising genius with a love for chemistry and science, but on the other, being hopelessly cocky and basking in the light of his own self-centered arrogance. How does one make a character like that watchable, let alone likable? Downey Jr. somehow pulls it off, using tactile energy and quick-witted humor as a means to convey a character we simply enjoy watching.Another fascination I have with Stark is his ability to be and remain public about his abilities as Iron Man. Most heroes prefer reclusion, resorting to closeting their abilities by acting as if they are darker, more elusive alter-egos. It's at least fascinating that Stark doesn't play by these old constraints and chooses to be as open about his alternate persona as a person who just took up a new job.With that said, there is more of a focus on Stark as a human rather than Stark accompanied by a large, straining iron suit. This way, his problems appear more humanly to us (not wanting to give up something that is rightfully his, trying to establish peace amongst large groups, etc) and his agony feels more close to home. If there is an unfortunate element to be found in Iron Man 2, it's that the focus too often shifts and there are really too many things going on here for them all to be truly explored in one-hundred and twenty-four minutes. This isn't as half-baked as it could've been, but it's not as deeply involving or as nourishing as it should have been either. And just when you think the ideas have all shown themselves, out pops Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), leader of the organization S.H.I.E.L.D, to inform Stark about his father and how he could be valued in the organization. And just when you think that's the final plotpoint, a twist features Scarlett Johansson's Natalie as someone that is more than just Stark's latest piece of eye candy.The idea of Stark refusing to surrender over his technology and advancements to the Defense Department alone could've made for an unbelievably interesting story about staying true to one's inner-self and holding on to what is rightfully yours, regardless of price or negotiations. However, could you see that being the main point of a superhero film? Neither could I; too many bad guys and too little time.Iron Man 2 is at least an ambitious sequel, looking to tackle a wide-range of ideas and central conflicts had by its title character. The problem is it takes enough plot from a potential Iron Man 3 in its quest for ambitiousness and variety. The action sequences remain fluent and grandiose, the actors all fill their parts nicely (if only Mickey Rourke was given more time to shine), and the sense of fun and excitement is still present. There's just a sheer listlessness of execution that needed to be discussed when implementing so many wonderful ideas.Starring: Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell, Mickey Rourke, and Samuel L. Jackson. Directed by: Jon Favreau",8,0,1,2 May 2013
Lords of Dogtown," Somebody's gonna get their head kicked in tonight...
","It's the early 1970's in Santa Monica, California. Long, sun-bleached hair, bad-boy mentalities, and lawless behavior were things that attracted the girls, and daredevils seemingly lurked around every street-corner, boasting a life of dysfunctional mishaps and isolation. It is when a skateboard-designer named Skip Engblom was given polyurethane wheels for his boards that allowed a skateboarder to have the ability to 'climb walls' and defy gravity did he get the bold idea that him and his surfer friends could revolutionize the activity, thus implementing a whole new kind of skating.The teens that pioneered this life were Skip (Heath Ledger), Tony Alva (Victor Rasuk), Stacy Peralta (John Robinson), and Jay Adams (Emile Hirsch). What assisted in their discoveries and possibilities was the ongoing drought that plagued most of the California area during the time, forcing nearby residencies to drain their pools. This led to the discovery that empty pools could be used as a good source of ramps and tricks. I believe it is a tradition that skateparks today have something like this on-location. Not only did the boys find popularity with the ladies, but were attracted to the business side of skating, where it is no longer innocuous riding, but an activity of skill and recklessness that only few are willing to pursue head-on.Lords of Dogtown explores this era in time, and pulls us along for a ride similar to what the protagonists in the film embarked on. The real Stacy Peralta penned the screenplay for the film and manages to give us a taste at what life was like during this time period.The two immediate things to laud about the film are its use of cinematography and extremely well-crafted soundtrack. The cinematography combines a high-contrast color scheme, complimented with grainy, documentary-like sequences of skating providing the viewer with a seemingly authentic experience. A wide variety of shots are utilized and explored, and we even get a nice look under the boards to examine the wheels doing what they do. Furthermore, the shot-variety is topped off with heavy-metal rock songs taken from all over the grid, again, giving the viewer a rather accurate depiction of the time period. This is one of those movies where the music adds a lot to the tonal aspect of the experience, and it helps out more than impressions would believe.We are given a cast of capable actors as well. Emile Hirsch, a talent still underrated and unsung to this day, gives a great performance as the reckless bad-boy, John Robinson, who I adored in Gus Van Sant's long forgotten Elephant, gives a performance of memorable status, and the same can be said for Victor Rasuk. Yet, the highlight here is inevitably Heath Ledger, giving a raw and realistic portrayal of a skateboarding prodigy. He was apparently drunk or under heavy substances during filming and I can say that this definitely helped the role - although it probably isn't recommended.The film was directed by Catherine Hardwicke, who worked behind the camera for the excellent film, Thirteen, which centered around a good girl gone bad when she met an underprivileged friend at school. Nikki Reed, the supporting actress of that film, returns here in a rather underwritten role as one of the main love interests. Lords of Dogtown seems to have all the pieces here, but what it forgets is to build on the story lines of these kids and their friends. We get many sequences of hardcore skating, scenes of them running from police, and scenes of competition, but never do we get simple scenes of talking. Writer Stacy Peralta either figures that viewers have seen the documentary, Dogtown and Z-Boys, which serves as the pseudo-predecessor to this film or believes that teenagers and skaters aren't interested in healthy, descriptive monologues. Correct me if I'm wrong, for I'm not a skater, but aren't many skaters emphasizing that they are often misunderstood because of societal stereotypes and are repeatedly ostracized? Aren't they sometimes looked at as the scum and pariahs of their community? I believe that some monologues about acceptance and societal visions would've fit well in this film, yet, alas, there are very few.As for Dogtown and Z-Boys, I've read numerous times online that in order to fully appreciate this film, one must watch that one beforehand. Having not seen that at this point, I can still say I got enough enjoyment out of the film to warrant amusement and interest, but not a recommendation. The film's a bit indulgent and neglects to offer as much depth and structure as one would assume, with this being written by a skater portrayed in the film. With that being said, if one were to seek out a fictionalized account of a skater's trouble with society and social differences after an unexpected accident occurs, one could watch Gus Van Sant's Paranoid Park, which illustrates this theme very carefully. I have just reviewed one marginally passable film and one of respectable quality. The choice is yours...Starring: Heath Ledger, Emile Hirsch, John Robinson, Victor Rasuk, Michael Angarano, Johnny Knoxville, and Nikki Reed. Directed by: Catherine Hardwicke.",6,0,2,15 July 2012
World War Z," The bar has been raised in the character department
","World War Z has the direct makeup of a summer blockbuster; a premise that is appealing to a large percentage of the public, enough action to fulfill another percentage's demands, enough background knowledge towards the final act, and a universally recognizable stare at its center. On that note, the film is a success because it features a lot of things that will appeal to a great deal of people. However, examining it from a smaller viewpoint, one that analyzes character-investment, development, and layout, one will see a cluttered film that goes on for a long time but never seems to make much progress.Even though I have not read the book, I can't help but feel that the film does something of a disservice to it. If I had not read the novel a film is based on, I try and research the contents and the impact it has garnered in order to provide something of a relatability point. The novel appeared to have contained a wide-variety of characters impacted by a zombie apocalypse, a series of instances that bring up commentary points for contemporary America, and provided readers with a plausible 'what-if' story about a zombie apocalypse.My immediate question upon viewing World War Z; where was this in the film? Where was the broad focus, the multiple characters, and the points about social and political life as we know it? Even if I'm misinformed about the novel, Brad Pitt's Gerry Lane character and story are still very thin and underdeveloped. If the film has incorporated all of the above, or even half of it, it could've possibly raised the standard for summer blockbusters into shockingly subversive territory. Instead, it sells its material and cast short, and the deeper the analysis, the clearer the evidence; World War Z is basic entertainment with a gargantuan budget, which is rumored to be over $500 million with advertising expenses.The story revolves around former UN employee Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt), his wife Karin (Mireille Enos), and their two daughters as they try to survive a zombie outbreak that occurs right when they are sitting in New York traffic. When all hell immediately breaks loose, they hide out in a small apartment, where Gerry learns he must go assist Dr. Andrew Fassbach (Elyes Gabel), a virologist looking to find the source of the outbreak. Once an origin, production on a vaccination can be mass-produced and quickly-delivered before the entire country is nothing but a wasteland inhabited by the walking dead.The first act of the film assumes traditional action and disaster movie-style, which is to portray a cacophony of catastrophic events occurring all at once in an overpopulated cityscape. At the middle of this chaos is, as stated, Lane's family, who survives numerous instances of peril akin to how John Cusack's family survived numerous close calls in Roland Emmerich's 2012. However, as these close calls aren't what World War Z rests on, thankfully adhering to a more cause-and-effect relationship with the way this outbreak began.This relationship takes up about the last hour of the film, and as a result, drags a bit because character-investment has been traded for meticulous and plodding plot-development towards the outbreak. With that being said, World War Z makes for efficient summer entertainment, but if one is seeking a zombie picture with a human focus, selective gore, and true vibes of uniqueness, the undiscovered gem The Battery lies on all video-on-demand services waiting to be viewed.Starring: Brad Pitt, Mireielle Enos, and Elyes Gabel.

The Hunger Games," Lacks the intensity and sting
","Suzanne Collins' novel The Hunger Games has been garnering a significant amount of fame with teenagers everywhere, and has a devoted legion of fans who have already seen this film at one of its notorious midnight showings. I have never read the novel, but knew much about it going in. Going out, I might've known less. If that's possible.The film is simple, moderately effective entertainment, but slow, a tad incompetent, and a bit overblown in some areas. The film centers around the nation of Panem, which has replaced North America. It is a totalitarian nation, with its government inflicting harsh punishments and dictatorship this way and that. Every year, they hold an event called 'The Hunger Games,' where two people, a male and a female from each of the twelve districts of Panem, battle to the death until one remains. It is done to further assure the Capitol has any and all authority, and that they can do what they want, when they want. No question.The girl chosen from District 12 is Prim Everdeen (Shields), younger sister of sixteen year old Katniss (Lawrence) who volunteers to take her place. The boy chosen from the district is Peeta Mellark (Hutcherson), who has had a life-long crush on Katniss. Both are taken from the district to train relentlessly for the games, which involve mainly practicing their archery skills. By far the most entertaining character in the whole film is Haymitch, portrayed wonderfully by Woody Harrelson, the only living victor from District 12. He mentors both Katniss and Peeta as they enter the most grueling task of their life.Let's start with the landscapes and the cinematography. When we see them, they are wonderful. Breathtaking and consuming. But director Gary Ross seems to enjoy seeing them through a shaky, indistinct position. It may not be his own fault, just his lack of credible experience. A good portion of the film and its battle scenes are captured with a shaky camera, possibly to add to the idea that the action is so fast-paced and non-linear the camera can't keep up. Even during some of the regular scenes the camera remains this way. It would've been nice if The Hunger Games could capture its battle scenes in a calm, collective, and controlled manner, but instead, it favors the route of incoherency and disjointedness.From a stylistic approach, the film is rather nice to look at. We do get well-deserved backstory on how the country operates and functions, but we don't learn enough about our leads. Also, these characters are being grossly toyed with in this nation. Does anyone try to rebel or overthrow the government? Or are they so oblivious to the idea of dictatorship and develop a strong contentment for this world. It seems illogical, when you think about it.The Hunger Games has its areas of strength. For one, its female leader is no priss. It's so rare to see women take charge in sci-fi adventure films, especially ones that follow this sort of formula. Jennifer Lawrence is strong and beyond capable as the role of a strong woman, victim to unfair circumstances, and manipulated by an unfair society. It's nice to see that the series looks at her as fearless and fit rather than a whiny, uninspired female caricature. Hutcherson, too, is very good and the two work together nicely when they can.But this is pretty standard in the field of adventures, in areas excluding its plot and acting. It lacks any sort of commentary on totalitarian societies, and doesn't seem to break new ground with the material it has. I sat debating on why the series has reached such a rare level of popularity with the masses. Is this the groundbreaking, extra-special, page-gripping novel that everyone is reading? The book had to be more than predominant scenes of archery and hectic instances of action. There had to be more depth and attraction to a novel so popular. What we are left with is somewhat sufficient, but droning for a two and a half hour film, including tacked on, roughly seventy minutes of buildup to the games themselves. The Hunger Games isn't bad, but it's redundant and winded, with much of the end being rather quiet and seemingly void of progression. Audiences are likely to enjoy it, but I'm sure fan reception will be all over the place. The film just seems too basic and limp, considering the book was a smashing success.Starring: Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz, Stanley Tucci, and Donald Sutherland.

Zootopia," Sly foxes and dumb bunnies come together to make the slickest, smartest animated film of the year
","You owe it to yourself to see Disney's new animated film Zootopia, a film so timely and relevant it's almost startling. You owe it to yourself to seek it out in a time in America where craziness, hatefulness, and fear is being further instilled in the general public by the very same people who should be fighting against it; the very same people who should be forcing us, as a collective, to rise above simple-minded assertions and mass generalizations about the people around us. You owe it to yourself to see this film simply because it's a brand new Disney classic.The film takes place in the vibrant, diverse world of Zootopia, a place where predators and prey live together in harmony, and are free to be whoever and whatever they want to be. These reasons are precisely why the land attracts Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin), a small bunny with dreams of being a police officer. Living on a farm, her parents fear this because, not only has a bunny never become a police officer, but they feel Judy should confine her aspirations to selling carrots on the family farm, something Judy has no interest in doing. After successfully completing police training, Judy is thrust into the force alongside other, more muscled animals such as rhinoceroses, rams, bulls, and elephants. Oh my.Judy's boss, Chief Bogo (Idris Elba), a buffalo, forces her to be a 'metermaid' while the other animals take on the bigger crimes, specifically a case involving fourteen missing predators. Judy tries to show herself by issuing over two-hundred citations in just a couple of hours, but to no avail, as Chief Bogo wants to make sure she knows her place on the Zootopia police force. When Judy winds up catching a weasel after robbing a store, she is just about to be fired when Chief Bogo tasks her with finding a local otter who has been missing for over a week. If she can find the otter in forty-eight hours or less, she can keep her job, but if she doesn't, she'll be forced to resign. Judy enlists in the help of Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), a fox, one of the most looked-down-upon predators in Zootopia, who has been doing number of odd jobs since he was young, after blackmailing him in order to get him to cooperate. Together, the two work to find the otter, but in turn, discover something bigger. Oh my.Zootopia wears its intentions on its sleeves, but not in a way that distracts or simplifies its core themes. As you can probably tell, this is a film about both racism and sexism, two features of society that, while probably never going away so long as humans roam the Earth, do not have to be such amplified forces of hate. Screenwriters Jared Bush and Paul Johnston carefully construct a world, predicated upon a particular dream, and within that world, populate it with a variety of characters, some labeled as normative, others quietly labeled as the enemy that many are waiting to step out of line. It doesn't take a scholar to see that rabbits represent women in society, while predators represent minorities.It does, however, take considerable screen writing talent to create a film that can be enjoyed and understood by both children and adults on a fairly similar level. Even Pixar's Inside Out was a film that sort of teetered a bit more to the adult crowd, with its lofty morals about children coping with their emotions, despite the fact that kids of all ages could at least enjoy the film as surface-level entertainment. Bush and Johnston pen Zootopia carefully, but bluntly, to the point where you can't ignore its profound, but simple message of inclusion and acceptance of peers. Oh my.Countless animated films have made themselves about preaching the gospel of acceptance and loving thy neighbor, but few have done it with the kind of thematic relevance, consistent wit, and zealous energy as Zootopia. Rather than sticking too a cleverly storyboarded, intricate plot, Bush and Johnston also have no problem playing around, allowing both Judy and Nick to free-roam in a sandbox full of original characters and allowing conversational/situational humor to prevail. This is why we get uproariously funny sequences involving three-toed sloths at the DMV, in addition to immensely creative, blink-and-you-miss-it chase sequences between a rabbit and a weasel. The film is not short on ideas nor energy, and the remarkable thing is how the film can go almost one-hundred miles an hour in every department and not even come close to running out of gas by the end credits.Zootopia is a contemporary Disney classic and should be treated as such; it will certainly give Pixar's questionable Finding Dory a run for its money in quality, awards, and overall relevance when it comes out this summer. This is a film that finds a way to be both sweet and simple, yet so urgent and topical, with an A-list voice cast, that you feel it's a soft rallying cry for unity, which is all the more reason why you shouldn't ignore it.Voiced by: Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, J.K. Simmons, Tommy Chong, and Octavia Spencer. Directed by: Byron Howard and Rich Moore.",10,98,198,4 March 2016
The Impossible," A challenge for everyone involved that was beautifully and maturely handled
","The one thing consistent with all disaster films is you can never sit comfortably within the opening scenes because you often know what is coming and you just can bear the thought of it. J.A. Bayona's The Impossible is a picture that captures a disaster all too realistically, as it depicts the tsunami that devastated Southeast Asia in 2004, killing an upwards of 300,000, destroying homes, soiling towns, and leaving families and memories in drenched and irreplaceable shambles. The thought of the last thing one sees is a wall of filthy, rushing water coming towards you at a breakneck speed is unthinkable.We center on Henry and Maria Bennett (Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts) and their three children Lucas (Tom Holland), Thomas (Samuel Joslin), and Simon (Oaklee Pendergast) who are on holiday in Thailand at a gorgeous resort when a tsunami from the Indian Ocean rushes into the mainland, destroying every thing in its path. Trees are taken right out of the ground, cars are trampled, houses are destroyed, people are taken for a ride underwater that they may not come out of, etc.During the scenes of the tsunami, we are provided with harrowing images of bodies being flung and tossed underwater. Maria, herself, is thrown into numerous items of debris, including impaling her leg on a tree branch and almost having her breast taken off. When the water finally ceases, Maria and Lucas wind up reconnecting and venture to find some sort of relief and hopefully find the rest of their family. In the process, they take a young boy named Daniel along, who was almost crushed by failing rubble. He is a sweet little tyke, whose innocence is captured beautifully, including a scene where he comforts Maria (who keep in mind is still a stranger) by softly rubbing her hair in the face of tragedy. The scene itself is absolutely adorable, evoking the beauty of human sympathy.Meanwhile, Henry, Thomas, and Simon are still at the resort, with Henry being scratched and bloodied, but still able-bodied unlike his wife. He tells his children to stick with a larger group while he searches for mom and Lucas, and the story of a family hoping to reunite with each other ventures on.I've often discussed emotional manipulation and how much I dislike it. I feel it's a road filmmakers go down to achieve an undeserved sentimental reaction. Instead of using tactics of the screenwriter, films often use unnecessary events that evoke sadness and usually buoys them with an obvious soundtrack. The Impossible uses some of that, mainly along the lines of musical manipulation, yet there's so much detail, humanity, and life that comes along with this tragedy that one could easily forget about all that. Films like Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close and the more recent Les Misérables are more to an advantage in the idea of emotional manipulation because they can simply say something like, 'look at these very depressing people.' They emptily showcase depression, where The Impossible almost forces you to put yourself in the shoes of this family and think what you would do.I think my biggest problem with The Impossible, even though it does so much right, is the fact that the film takes place in Thailand, the story we're given is based off the true events of a Spanish family, and the cast is almost unanimously white. It's a subtle feature, that isn't a complete turn off unless you make it one, but it's a little disconcerting and questionable that the characters the film primarily focuses on are white in a country that is certainly complete in its Asian and Spanish demographic.Yet I'll stop there before I start some race war I do not plan to fight. It's a petty feature that shouldn't distract from the film at hand. I stated in my review of Life of Pi that it was the most emotional movie event of the year, and that I found Les Misérables underwhelming emotionally. This film reassured that I could still be greatly effected by a film in strong, moving ways. There are several scenes in The Impossible that evoke tears, so many actually that I left the theater physically and mentally exhausted. One scene in particular is when Henry is with many other people in the dead of night, with a man passing around a cell phone urging them to call their loved ones. Henry calls his close friend, and through tears explains vaguely what happened before assuring he'll reconnect with his wife and son before hanging up. The man tells Henry that he can not end a conversation like that and gives the phone back to Henry, who elaborates more clearly the second time around. It's a simple scene, likely to go unnoticed by many viewers of the film, but it shows the magnitude of the situation to such a degree that you can't even coherently explain it without sobbing or simply questioning it to certain extremes.Naomi Watts has just been nominated for Best Actress in the 85th Academy Awards, and her role deserves it. While she spends much of the film barely conscious and clinging on to life on a hospital bed, she is given a very physically demanding role that challenges a performer to provide the audience members with believability and sentiment and she achieves it through a heart-wrenching, motherly performance. McGregor does fine work as a conflicted father, and the children, mainly Tom Holland, are quite capable here, expressing their innocence in several sequences, including the fear of seeing your mother in great pain when you're used to seeing it the other way around. The Impossible is one of the most affecting disaster films in quite sometime, and one of the saddest dramas of the 2012 year.",9,3,7,13 January 2013
42," Inspiration in a bleak world
","42 is roughly the third baseball movie in the last three years that smartly focuses its storyline on the more interesting element at hand here, and leaves the game of baseball as a backdrop. That element is, of course, the human aspect of the story rather than the game, which I've seen enough of in films to publish an amateur baseball novel. With films like Moneyball and Trouble With the Curve furthering story and characters, the baseball genre in cinema has greatly expanded its horizons from forgettable affairs like The Babe and The Sandlot.This is the much-needed biopic of Jackie Robinson, the legendary Brooklyn Dodgers baseman who became recognized as the first black man to play in what was known as 'white man's baseball' in the mid-1940's. Robinson, a controlled and intelligent soul, is played by Chadwick Boseman, a name I bet many would still question even with the films release. Boseman brings the kind of energy and spirit the role of Robinson needs. His character inhabits the mindset of complete subtleness, not overplaying or undermining the charisma and personality Robinson was known to convey. The film follows his humble beginnings in third-rate 'black leagues,' his marriage to Rachel, his stint with the Dodgers' minor league affiliate the Montreal Royals, and finally, his career with the Dodgers that sparked nationwide controversy and uproar from the public and the opposing team members as well. There's something tragically disheartening and frustrating to see half the stadium cheer and celebrate Robinson's victories, while the other half is condemning him for nothing more than his skin color.Yet such ignorance and hatred was prominent in America at the time, and director Brian Helgeland doesn't shy away from the ugliness. A scene later in the film shows a father and son discussing the game of baseball in a calm manner until Robinson takes the field. The father begins shouting slurs that would've gave Django the chills and continues to do so when his son - no older than eleven - chimes in and brings the hate in. Helgeland's focus of how racism spreads and feeds, while quiet and relatively unnoticeable, reminds me of how John Singleton's Rosewood portrayed how racism is passed on through generations through the voices of authoritative figures to be intercepted by their young sons.Moreover, supporting performances are mostly competent and compelling, with the most convincing being Harrison Ford's Branch Rickey, the Brooklyn Dodgers executive. Another sure to go under the radar is Lucas Black, who looks a tad like a younger Anthony Edwards. Black starred in the ho-hum Seven Days in Utopia about two years ago, assuming a likable state but not working much in the favor of a trite, contrived script. Here, Black is given a much wide range in a more interesting picture. He plays Pee Wee Reese, one of the few Dodger ballplayers that didn't object to Robinson's presence on the team solely because of his skin color. His character does something that sadly appears as a novelty back then and still somewhat does today; judges on character.One of the supporting performances that seems sadly neglected is Nicole Beharie's, as Robinson's long-suffering wife, who must be vocally silenced, like her husband, in the face of discrimination and second-class citizen attitudes. Her struggle as a young mother trying to support her widely-loathed husband in the face of intolerance. Such a subplot could've but etched and drawn to fit germane to the hardships of Robinson, but the film decides to almost completely shortchange her story, even looking at their marriage as an insignificant footnote in his life.My biggest complaint is the film's tonal personality, which is very bombastic and hits all the notes with a sort of jarring, bombastic attitude. To put it simply, you laugh when you're supposed to laugh, you may tear up when you should, and you are predictably enraged when the racism comes into play. 42 isn't subversive with your emotions, and doesn't allow you to have much of your own opinion or interpretation outside of what it's conveying, but yet it really doesn't need to. As welcomed as that would've been, when you watch a biopic on Jackie Robinson, or another cultural figure, you're sort of taking everything as it comes and you rarely form an opinion outside of what is being shown. If you approach the film with a willingness to indulge in the experience differently than others, this may be a tougher film to do that with. I almost wish that the Helgeland would've made the film more subtle and softer like its lead character.And yet, 42 must be noted for its meticulous detail, right down to a steam locomotive in the background during one of the baseball games. The bright, scenic cinematography is another welcoming addition for such a story. While the tone may be a bit overblown and the heavy-handedness a bit too strong, it doesn't shortchange the film's impact as an inspirational piece of cinema. After all, sometimes that's why we go to the movies - in a bleak world, we need all the motivation we can get.NOTE: My video review of 42, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdO4wFUalmIStarring: Chadwick Boseman, Harrison Ford, Lucas Black, and Nicole Beharie.

Argo," Affleck continues to rebuild his career with another home-run
","Now here is a thriller I'm willing to catch in theaters. I weary so quickly of action films employing stiff quick cuts, minimal character development, and macro events taken with micro focus, and am constantly tiring of seeing characters return in a sequel to a film that shouldn't really need one. Ben Affleck's third directorial effort, Argo, is a cinematic triumph; a film so grand, so impacting, and so implausible that it's undoubtedly one of the tensest pictures of the year.It's 1979, in the dawn of the Iranian Revolution. We open with archival footage of news clips and attack footage of the time, and are quickly presented with anarchic unrest outside the gates of the U.S. embassy in Tehran. Iranian revolutionaries are disgusted at the United States' support of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah at the time, and begin to break into the concourse of the embassy and take most of the workers as hostages.Lucky enough to escape are six employees, who hide out in the home of Ken Taylor (Victor Garber), the Canadian ambassador, while the State Department devises a plan to return the hostages safely to America. Brought in on a whim, CIA specialist Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) is called to evaluate multiple plans to return the hostages, and after watching Battle for the Planet of the Apes with his son on TV, he believes he has it.He proposes the preposterous idea that if they can convince the Iranian public that the six escapees are a Canadian film crew scouting for 'exotic locations' in the country, that they could potentially meet up with the six, and return them safely. Tony quickly gets in touch with Hollywood make-up artist, John Chambers (John Goodman) and film producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), who hop on board with the idea of creating a fake film, even though you can see they find the idea to be highly questionable and, above all, dangerous.After paging through screenplays, they settle on a film called 'Argo' as their fake film, a science-fiction film about God-knows-what. When asked by an executive what 'Argo' actually means and how it is relevant to the film, Lester replies, with much frustration, 'I don't know, Argo f*** yourself,' a line that will be continuously used in the film. That's right, as surprising as it is, Argo loosens its belt and concocts a witty, sometimes uproariously funny screenplay, not afraid to dive into cheeky humor or sometimes come close to tugging at the heart-strings.Affleck becomes fully immersed in this story, from a directing standpoint and an acting standpoint. He is barely recognizable in his role, with shaggy hair and a scruffy beard, a look that fits the macho figure himself, yet surrounded by a group of mainly unknown actors portraying the hostages, he becomes one with them, and his presence doesn't feel forced or abruptly out of place. It is simply fitting. His supporting cast, also serving as his film crew, Arkin and Goodman, show audiences why they should be credited highly, with serious performances when need be and comedy pleasantly punctuated throughout.The story's darkest points come in the latter-half of the film, and I dare not spoil them, but I'll propose this question in the meantime that I hope some will seriously contemplate; what if you had to completely change your identity and memorize precise details that rewrote your life? What if you forgot just one detail or did not recite it fast enough, your life would be ended or in far greater jeopardy than you could imagine? Behind the camera, this is easily Affleck's most uncompromising, incredibly entertaining piece of work; flawlessly directed, craftily edited, acted to near-perfection, written with wit and heart, and keenly glossed with the look and feel of an intoxicating and fulfilling espionage from the 1970's. The film-grain adds to the dated-effect this movie wants to achieve, and with precise detailing in the cinematography and aesthetics (right down to the original Warner Bros. logo at the beginning), it is clear that Argo is a meticulously crafted, remarkable picture filled to the brim with everything a traditional moviegoer and a full-fledged cinephile could ask for. It's one of the best films of the year.NOTE: I strongly advise viewers to stay well into the credits. We see pictures of the real six escapees alongside their screen-counterparts, and we also see scenes alongside the real-life images to prove that director Affleck, writer Chris Terrio, and the rest of the crew went to mold the film into a truly accurate piece of art.Starring: Ben Affleck, John Goodman, Alan Arkin, and Victor Garber.

12 Angry Men," 12 angry men makes one satisfied viewer
","Sidney Lumet's 12 Angry Men is an interesting choice for one of the greatest American films of all time given its simultaneous abstraction and straight-forwardness as a film. It concerns a group of twelve jurors who are retired to reach a verdict on a murder case involving an eighteen-year-old living in the slums of New York, who is accused of murdering his father at their home. We are immediately taken into the New York City courthouse, where the twelve jurors are sent to their private room to discuss the case and come to a unanimous vote in favor of life or death for the boy. All but one juror is positive beyond a reasonable doubt that the boy in question is guilty and deserves the chair for his crimes.The man is Henry Fonda's character, a man who, like all but one other soul in the room, remains nameless until the end of the film. While he doesn't entirely believe the boy's innocence, he is unsure that he is guilty and feels it is wrong to jump to a decision about a young life so quickly without at least talking over the facts. With that, the jurors are forced to divulge some sort of conversation to get on the same page in favor of one side or the other. During this time, the New York City heat is sweltering, the fan in the room isn't working, and one juror cannot wait until he is released so he can go to a baseball game in the evening. What would normally be a quick meeting between twelve men turns into a bitter, but rational display or exchanging facts about the case and going against groupthink by providing logical alternatives to the events recounted by the witnesses.Fonda's character is called a lot of things in the film and many of them are accurate to his persona, albeit in a bitter, shortchanging manner. He is referred to as a 'golden boy,' sympathizing a young boy in the slums who has ostensibly taken on a life of savagery if he is in fact guilty. His character basically recites the same dialog repeatedly throughout the film, stating how he is not totally sure if he indeed not guilty, but can't be certain that he is guilty, leaving a reasonable doubt on his mind that he is too ethical to override.One of the many intriguing things about Fonda's stance is his ability to go against the grain; the slightest doubt in his mind, at first, the commonality of the boy's alleged murder-weapon, a pocketknife, leads him to stall an otherwise unanimously convinced jury that the boy on trial is guilty. How many people, even if they had the slightest doubt in their mind, would challenge eleven other men who have raised their hands in favor of the boy's guilt and subsequent death? Most people, including myself probably, would bury our skepticism under our own volition of self-deprecation: 'maybe I missed something,' we'd think, 'maybe I'm just way off,' we'd add, before humbly raising our hand in a delayed fashion to make what looked to be a hung jury a unanimous vote. If Fonda's character would've done that, 12 Angry Men would be a depressingly common and pointless short film; not one of the greatest works of American cinema.The key to the film's renowned qualities lies in a few places. As stated, the first is the plausibility to believe the jurors become wrong-headed once they begin agreeing with Fonda's character. Some would argue that having these characters basing an entire trial/murder on the happenings of scattered incidents that were relatively minor in the grand-scheme would result in a miscarriage of justice. Film critic Mike D'Angelo says that these twelve jurors would probably be the same ones who would acquit O.J. Simpson of his murder charges. The fact is, we don't know at the end of it; we weren't there, we were never destined to be there, and all we know is that one person is dead, one person is about to own or disown responsibility to that death, and there is reasonable doubt lingering in the room like fragrant cologne. The correctness or morality of the jurors' decision isn't so much in question, for I'm sure a dinner conversation between two people who viewed the film disagreeing with the jurors' decisions could indeed occur with both parties having enough well-founded evidence.This brings me to the other noteworthy element about the film, which is its ability to operate in several different genres. The attributes of the film I just mentioned, leading it to be discussed and interpreted in a number of different ways, makes it a biting mystery, while the rapid-fire, investigative dialog in the second and third act turns the film more in the direction of a suspense film or a crime-drama. Finally, there's the inherent melodrama of character relations, with numerous not getting along with one another and the hard-headedness of other jurors standing in the way in preventing what could be a potential miscarriage of justice (Ed Begley's character, for example, who remains incorruptibly certain that the boy is guilty).Finally, above all in some minds, there's the sheer entertainment value of 12 Angry Men. This is a film that further proves my point that a film that takes place in one room and is heavily built on character relations and character development can be just as gripping as a film predicated upon large action setpieces and costly displays of action. As droll as the film may seem, this is one of the most entertaining courtroom-dramas I've yet to see with some of the most ambiguous questions about rebelling against groupthink, the analysis of justice and legal practices, and the sheer impact and significance of reasonable doubt(s) I have ever seen.",10,1,3,12 November 2015
Hostel," It's amazing what you'll find in that old basement
","Eli Roth's Cabin Fever was a fun, yet flawed journey through the formula of the horror genre, but still kept an even pacing with a few well-done sequences. Here comes Hostel, a film that would continue the 'torture porn' sub-genre of the horror world, like the never-ending Saw franchise. It's clear that Roth's intentions and expectations for this were high, but it becomes tiresome and drab very quickly.To begin with we are presented with uninspired, yet somewhat interesting characters. They are backpackers named semi-smart Paxton (Hernandez), the intelligent leader Josh (Richardson), and the womanizer Óli (Guðjónsson). The men are touring Europe and hitting every strip club or party house within radius. They are informed there are more adventures in Bratislava. So it's off to Bratislava they go.There they drink and party it up, fall asleep, and realize their friend Óli is missing. We, the viewer, find out that he was taken to a dungeon-like prison where people are beaten, tortured, and killed in gruesome and unforgivable ways.My first problem is the pacing. It's incredibly slow and not in the good way. Horror directors have become less aware that pacing is the key to a great kill or attack. Jump scares, solely, can not sustain a movie. Well, a good movie. For the first fifty minutes of Hostel, we have to watch some of the lamest, most redundant scenes of nudity and sex. It is common for horror films to contain both of those, but Hostel presents them gratuitously, without rhyme or reason.When the torture comes, it's gory and harsh, yet uninspired. This might not be Roth's fault as much as it is the Saw franchise's. We've seen so much stronger scenes of torture is makes Hostel have a moot presence. But that's not to say the Saw films are masterpieces in any way, shape, or form. They are just more violent, gruesome, and unapologetic. Hostel pails in comparison.Still, it's a very mean-spirited film. It's bleak, grisly, ugly, and dark in its appearance. It's a film of little positives and many negatives. Scary it is not, but cringe-inducing it is. Hostel is the kind of horror film that comes out of the blue and gains notoriety from the depraved gorehounds. That pretty much assures we're in for some unimpressive sequels.Starring: Jay Hernandez, Derek Richardson, Eyþór Guðjónsson, Barbara Nedeljáková, and Rick Hoffman.

Happy Gilmore," The price is right, but the payment is short
","Golf is dreadfully boring. Thankfully, films like Caddyshack and Happy Gilmore posses ambition to bring fun to the green. Both are fresh ideas that use their actors to motivate their screenplay. Unfortunately, Happy Gilmore manages to drive itself into the high grass area shortly when the game commences. Let's watch...Happy Gilmore is often cited as 'Sandler's funniest film.' I'm not sure he has one. I recently did a fairly lengthy blog post on the subject of Sandler's films and tried my hardest to find the one that made me laugh and enjoy thoroughly. I'd probably say his best piece of work had to be Funny People. Was it funny? Not a whole lot, but it was enjoyable and a step in the right direction Sandler quickly abandoned.The story of Happy Gilmore is simple; a loud, energetic, aspiring hockey player of the same name takes up golf when he finds out he has a powerful swing. He has serious anger management issues, and because of that, somehow, he attracts the gorgeous Julie Bowen, who plays a Public Relations Director, and also, a fellow golf player named Shooter McGavin (McDonald) who wants Gilmore off the face of the golf world.What Gilmore desperately wants to accomplish is getting $270,000 so he can buy back his grandmother's house that was recently taken away by the IRS because of failure to meet tax payments over the last decade.There's the setup, compiled of the obligatory sports movie and love story clichés, but the main problem is, well, Sandler's character. The Happy Gilmore character is odd, annoying, and aggravating. This is what you call a film's desperate attempt at comedy. Gilmore is easily fatigued, which is why his character is seriously hard to like or side with. The character gets into fights every few minutes, resulting in lame, cartoonish blows to the face and also to Sandler's personal ego.It seems the film couldn't succeed in the writing portion and went immediately to the punching, kicking, 'things didn't go my way' kind of slapstick. Keep in mind that if you read many of my reviews you'll know I am a fan of silly slapstick. It takes a certain mood and a very likable lead actor to pull off good slapstick. I wonder if Chris Farley could've brought more coherent likability to the Happy Gilmore character.Also, the product placement is shamefully explicit. I'm aware it's golf, and like every other sport, is known to display product placement around the field, but when doing it in a film it appears that some of the big name companies are put in for the money - not the realism of the source material. Especially the utterly shameless marketing for Subway. Have mercy.When compared to present day Adam Sandler, Happy Gilmore has a harmless innocence to it. It's not harmful in any way, except maybe your tolerance level. Sandler finds will be at home with this, while others will search the screenplay high and low for the real humor.But, the film does deliver laughs, just not consistently. There's nothing more uncomfortable than watching a comedy, that is supposed to be funny, but isn't. Happy Gilmore gets laughs, but a lot of them aren't distinct in any way. I think the most memorable scene is when Bob Barker and Happy Gilmore square off on the green. I think one of Barker's lines before the scene should've been 'humor, come on down!' Starring: Adam Sandler, Julie Bowen, Christopher McDonald, and Carl Weathers. Directed by: Dennis Dugan.",5,4,6,26 November 2011
The Notebook," The cinematic romance that tests reality and fantasy
","Maybe I'm just too cynical for the subject matter, but I didn't shed a tear during The Notebook. I watched what is said to be 'one of the saddest films ever made' dry-eyed. And I'm an emotional person. I've cried probably to more films than you, the person reading this right now. I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing to get very emotional during a film. I think that shows a sign of good filmmaking.I personally have a strict rule where if I cry during a film I must give it some sort of a positive review. That means the film actually made me feel for its fictitious characters and their story and struggle. Therefore it is a film not to be missed. Whether I cry tears of joy, happiness, sadness, calamity, or frustration, the film will get some sort of positive review.And now I'm faced with The Notebook, apparently one of the saddest films in existence and I didn't get emotional once. Something must be wrong. The film stars young actors Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams as two, and I use this term effectively, star-crossed lovers who meet in South Carolina during the summer.Gosling is Noah, while McAdams is Allie. This is the forties so when a guy likes a girl he really likes a girl. Noah and Allie meet at a carnival, and soon enough, thinks sparkle and they become in young love. Noah is a local boy, while Allie derives from a rich family who is said to have 'more money than God.' They fight a lot, and sometimes can be extremely physically and emotional abusive. But what love is perfect? The story is told by an elderly man talking to an elderly woman in a nursing home. This is where the film's first major problem comes in - you can see the 'twist' coming a mile away. I won't spoil it, but it seriously goes without saying. The elderly man is played by James Garner, who comes with a strange presence, and Gena Rowlands as the elderly woman.The man continues to tell the story of the lovers, who eventually part ways and then reunite years later. The first half of the film is well-written, extremely well acted, and comes with enriching photography. Then the film just becomes a little cliché and somewhat unbelievable as it wraps up.It doesn't state this blatantly, but The Notebook is a strong romantic-fantasy. Perhaps one of a teenage girl's imagination. Things happen in the film that stretch the line of reality very, very far. The chemistry is believable, but the story is only about half. I don't believe a girl I know would stick by a man so emotionally abusive to a woman. Not to mention in the world we live in today.This cinematic romance is cute, but nonetheless predictable. I mentioned Allie comes from a rich family, and boy does she occupy every characteristic of it. From the controlling mother, to the 'everything she wants but a man' personality, she truly is the carbon copy of a rich female. Noah, on the other hand, is your typical local boy with his mind on working and girls.The Notebook is cute, yet I think more shallow then people see. I believe the idea of it, to a female, overshadows how far-fetched it truly is. It's every woman's dream - to find a man who is so willing to be with this woman he devotes half his life to doing things for and about her. The problem is something that is hard to explain. As a cinematic romance fantasy it works. As a realistic love story it doesn't.Romances have come a long way. It's strange, but as a male I really do appreciate them. I think I like the 'invisible guy gets the dream girl' type films more than the true cinematic romances. But that doesn't mean I can't appreciate these types of films. The Notebook is truly a good film, but many women should be aware this is about as far-fetched as a love story can be from the twist to the very end.Starring: Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams, James Garner, Gena Rowlands, Sam Shepard, James Marsden, and Joan Allen.

Madagascar," Has meat, but not in the story
","It is pretty clear to even the most unaware film consumer that there are two different types of animation and they aren't hand drawn and CGI. They are Dreamworks and Pixar, one who makes cute, yet sort of flat animated pictures, and the other who makes essential animated films that are deep and very moving. Madagascar falls in the latter category of being kind and positive in its spirits, but a tad too slapsticky to provide efficient and quality entertainment. It's a feast for the eyes, not the heart.Yet there truly is nothing wrong with that. Our story takes place at the Central Park Zoo where Alex the lion (voiced by Ben Stiller) is guaranteed to put on a great show for his audience. He is boisterous, cocky, and determined to keep his high status with the people with his line of trinkets and accessories for sale there. Alex's friends are a zebra, Marty (Chris Rock), a hippo, Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith), and a giraffe, Melmen (David Schwimmer).When Marty begins to hunger for life outside of the mundane four cage walls, he escapes to Grand Central Station, only to be followed by his three friends. Once they're apprehended at the station they are taken, crated up, and shipped off to a Kenyan Wildlife preserve. It just so happens that four maniacal penguins escaped from the zoo as well, and take command on the ship hoping to cruise to Antarctica, and during all this camaraderie, the four crates with Alex, Marty, Gloria, and Melmen fall off the ship and are washed up onto Madagascar.That was a mouthful. The only one truly satisfied at this colossal misunderstanding is Marty, who is glad to be in the wild, where he can live free and become a new zebra. The four wind up meeting a colony of furry little critters, all governed by King Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen) who sings the infectious anthem 'I Like to Move It' twice in the entire picture.There is a lot of manic situations in Madagascar, a film that occupies a meager runtime of just seventy-nine minutes, yet in that time a conflict is introduced, characters rapidly appear, havoc occurs, a conclusion is tacked on, and boom, the credits roll. Everything moves in such a rushed pace it's a wonder why the film can't take time to stop and catch its breath. It appears to run out of steam when the animals wash up on the island.Now here is where we can definitely tell that there are two different animation classes in the mix. If this was a Pixar film, its star power wouldn't be used as a gimmick. Oh, Pixar uses celebrities in their pictures, but ever notice how they don't really boast them? Tom Hanks and Tim Allen lend their voices in all three Toy Story pictures, but they're so natural and unobtrusive that they are never a distracting element. The problem with Madagascar is never do we feel that these characters are themselves. We feel they are Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett Smith, David Schwimmer, and Sacha Baron Cohen, respectively.Another sign of the two animation teams among us is when we see an animated picture become too reliant on bathroom humor and contrived wittiness rather than sentimentality and storytelling. Madagascar has a nice retro look to it, but that can't disguise its elementary storytelling and the thin effect it has on audience members. Kids will embrace it helpfully, and there parents will too seeing as many more viewings will become inevitable, but with such quality works out there such as Lilo and Stitch, Shrek, and Toy Story why waste time on the inessential?

"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Embrace satire because fearing it will prove it correct
","It's always very iffy when we see a film based off a popular Television show hit theaters. We are unsure if it will just be a typical story stretched to fit theatrical standards, boasting virtually nothing unique or big screen worthy, or if it will be an exclusive adventure only fit for theaters. South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut knows it's leaping from the small to big screen, and to prepare for its monumental leap, caused a great deal of controversy with the MPAA about whether it deserved an R or NC-17 rating.The film has to be one of the smartest animated pictures in decades, and probably the best Television-to-film adaptation along with Beavis and Butthead Do America and The Simpson's Movie. It is an unforgettable excursion, not only providing a plethora of good, and bad, laughs but also giving us hefty commentary on social issues and a delightful and poignantly brilliant satire on customs, war, vague xenophobia, and the handling of strong moral issues.Our story centers around the mountain town of South Park, Colorado where our four boys, Kyle, Stan, Cartman, and Kenny (voiced by Parker and Stone), foul-mouthed, ill-behaved elementary schoolers, take a trip to the movies to see the Canadian picture 'Terrance and Phillip: Asses on Fire.' The film is vile and littered with foul language, politically incorrectness, and flatulence, and the boys eat it up. They repeat the off color phrases at school, along with the rest of the students, which eventually gets their mothers involved to start a war against Canada.If there's anything the film does extremely well, and believe me it does a lot of things of commendable nature, it's adding in a highly memorable, insanely catchy score. Parker and Stone have incorporated a musical aspect with everyone of their films, except BASEketball. Here, it is fitting, infectious, and witty in its attempts to add zest and flavor to its arguments.I mentioned the film is sick with satire. That it is. It discusses very strong elements, some of which I believe South Park is all about. The film has something to say about censorship, first amendment rights, parenting, and acting on behaviors impulsively, where the thought of no serious consequences will ever come into play. The strongest thing it comments on is the parenting aspect. The film would've been over in twenty minutes if the parents sat down with their children and had an honest, open, and influential talk about morals, language, and the media. There is a scene where Mr. Mackey tries to take charge of the issue by getting the kids to replace their 'naughty words' with things a bit lighter and less offensive (in the form of song of course). But it doesn't work. Immediately when they're released from school, they return to the cinemas for an umpteenth helping of 'Terrance and Phillip.' It shows that the schools can't do the job of parenting, and when they try, they fail to reach any point of reason. Parenting should come from the parents. Not third party outlets.When it comes to censorship and parental reactions in the film, I'm sure Parker and Stone weren't the least bit shy in incorporating elements and remarks they've probably received from the show itself. South Park has to be the most controversial show of the 1990's and still the 2000's. The show has just entered its sixteenth season, remaining on the mellow side poking fun at how we sit on toilets and 'Cash for Gold' outlets. But its last few seasons have gotten its creators in some major, major trouble. Both times involving the Muslim prophet Muhammad as a running joke.This is truly one of the sharpest satires to come out in years, nonetheless an animated one. I can't help but laugh at the idea on how seriously some people take the show. The beauty is it is so crudely animated; just vibrant construction paper resembling the look of a grade school project, yet it is so harsh, mean-spirited, violent, vulgar, and sex-driven. South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut basks in the idea of having a full length movie about itself. A movie where truly anything goes. No beeps, blurs, or restrictions. Unadulterated, unmatchable satirical humor combined perfectly with gross out gags and wit to envy. I'll be damned if it's not one of the most profound pictures of the nineties decade.Voiced by: Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Directed by: Trey Parker.",9,0,0,26 March 2012
Little Boy," A film so far outside of reality's ballpark it's playing a different game
","This time last year, we were granted with 'Heaven is for Real,' a miserably schmaltzy film that was so overwrought in its intentions and portrayal of emotions that it easily merited a spot on my list for the worst films of the year. This year, however, we have 'Little Boy,' one of the first faith-based films of the year along with 'Do You Believe?,' a film that will likely earn a place on this year's list. Films like this should insult the audience, if they are smart enough to know they are being condescended to through the use of soft-lighting and cinematography, an overbearing musical score that lets them know when they should feel happy and sad, and sole lines and sequences desperately made to extract tears from the audience who are temporarily blindsided by the fact that these particular events exists so far outside the ballpark of reality it's playing a different game.'Little Boy' concerns an America that's plunged in a tumultuous period; World War II's impact and scope is growing, the army needs more soldiers and young men on the frontlines, families are being separated for indefinite periods of time, and Japanese citizens are just being released from internment camps, causing civil unrest. We focus on the Busbee family, particularly Pepper (Jakob Salvati), a stout seven-year-old who is the subject of bullying for his short stature. Despite this, he finds a great connection with his imaginative father James (Michael Rapaport), until he is called to fight in Hiroshima, leaving Pepper with his mother (Emily Watson) and his heavy-drinking older brother London (David Henrie).During this time, Pepper seeks out ways to exercise and strengthen his personal faith, which a Reverend informs him could help bring his father back. However, this result will only occur if his faith is strong enough. Pepper loves magicians, particularly the great Ben Eagle, who calls him on stage during one of his shows to move a soda bottle. Eagle informs Pepper that the only way to do it is to have incorruptible faith and even the slightest shred of doubt - easily brought on by a crowd full of ridiculing children Pepper's age - will prohibit the bottle from being moved. After a lot of grunting and screaming on Pepper's part, the bottle moves, and Pepper believes the stronger his faith gets, the more likely his father will be brought back home safe and sound. During his journey of self-discovery, he meets Hashimoto (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), an ostracized Japanese man who also helps him recognize his faith.The level of frothiness in this film cannot be accurately stated. Scenes carry immense artificial weight to them, bathing themselves in beautiful scenery and loud and obvious musical numbers that cast blatant moods of either 'happy' or 'sad' unto the audience. Throw in Salvati's innocent face, his perfectly combed blonde hair, and his teary-eyed plea for his father to stay home, and you have precisely the kind of emotional sentimentality I hate. Not a single moment in 'Little Boy' is genuine, as it all feels conjured up through deliberately facile means of exploiting the audience's emotional complexes. This, in turn, making them think they've seen a good film when they've really just been played for fools.Shedding tears to a film is something I'm no stranger of; I've probably done it more than a great deal of my peers to films that didn't even upset them. If a film can extract emotion from the audience, that means it has made them care about the characters on screen through numerous different things, including acting, directing, and writing. It's a powerful thing, and when it happens to you, you're almost surprised at yourself. However, 'Little Boy' is going for the easily extractable tears. Its emotion comes from the aesthetics and how they manipulate the viewer and not from the characters or the situations themselves. Here, scenes beg weeping and other scenes beg you to have an ear-to-ear smile; nothing is subtle, nothing is left to the imagination.The film's tagline is 'Believe the impossible,' which is fitting because that's the only way one will receive much enjoyment from this film. Watching a seven-year-old stand before an enormous mountain and eventually come to move it through his faith may be a cute idea in theory, but to watch it happen, in a film that desperately wants you to believe what cannot be done regardless of how much faith a person has among countless other manipulative filmmaking strategies, makes for a desperately cloying movie-going experience.NOTE: Take a second look at the title while you're at it too; recall high school history class if you must. It doesn't just mean what you think it means, and because of that, it adds one more frightening element to this film.",2,26,62,24 April 2015
The Girl Next Door," Your inconsistency is showing
","I had to contemplate long and hard what grade I would give this movie. It was teetering on the edge of recommendation, when ultimately, a few little things docked it down to a state where I can't really recommend it. With that being said, I will say that The Girl Next Door did however keep me entertained for all one hundred and ten minutes because of its very vibrant casting and quite a few jokes that were actually funny that weren't seen in the trailer.Speaking of the trailer, it is another film that pretty much covers up parts of the plot to draw more of an audience. The same thing happened in the trailer for Dream a Little Dream where the big part about the body swapping element was left without a mention. In the trailer for this film, it tries to make this look like a teen comedy following in the footsteps of the American Pie franchise. When really, it is more of an adult raunchy comedy.The plot: Matthew (Hirsch) is a high school Senoir stressing over his big speech he is set to give on the topic 'moral fiber,' which may get him a scholarship to the prestigious Georgetown University. Looking back on his High School experience when asked what he'll remember, Matthew tries hard to recollect what he will remember but can't find anything.Matthew is in luck because he gets a new neighbor. Her name is Danielle (Cuthbert) and she is probably every guy's masturbatory fantasy come true. Matthew is in his room and notices her changing clothes and can't help but stare. Seeing him, Danielle comes over to introduce herself of all things instead of tell Matt's parents he was snooping.They hang out frequently, developing an awkward yet likable friendship until Matt's friend Eli (Marquette) informs him that she was a porn star under the stage name 'Athena.' Matt is shocked, and in disbelief, and soon enough, he meets the cut throat producer of Danielle's named Kelly (Olyphant) who means business. Kelly and Matt form a very unsettling relationship, and his life begins to spiral out of control between the love of his life and the consequences.The story does have a good motto and moral that is probably one of my favorites next to the meaningful bit in Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle. In that film, a guy in prison tells Harold that 'there is no sense getting all riled up every time a bunch of idiots give you a hard time, (because) the universe tends to unfold as it should.' In this, Kelly firmly tells Matthew to ask himself 'is the juice worth the squeeze?' meaning is Danielle worth the possible consequences. Because of what Matthew tells Danielle in the movie at an adult convention, she declines Kelly's offer and goes back home.While bringing good actors and a good motto into the light, the film also has a number of inconsistencies that I found. One of them is age seems to mean nothing in this film. There's one scene where Kelly and Danielle take Matt to a strip club. Keep in mind, Matthew is in high school and is no older than eighteen or nineteen. How did he manage to get into the strip club? Same thing with the adult convention. How did the three friends get into the convention when they're only Senoirs in high school? Also, why is Danielle going to an adult convention as 'Athena' when she is a 'former' porn star? Wouldn't that mean she quit doing it, and usually when you quit something, you don't make public appearances as the job you quit. In order for this movie to exist, many things also can't. Like age and occupation rules.Those things really drag the film down, along with the fact the film does nothing but glorify the world of porn. Not one women in this film, except for Matt's mom (Bullock), is not put in this film to show of their body. I find it a little odd that we see such a world of porn stars and personality lacking women in a film that tries to have a strong motto. While the film packs on a good motto, it doesn't do much to eliminate stereotypes.But for some reason, this film still stood out to me for the music, the performances, and the overall feel. Obviously, the poster child for this type of genre is Risky Business. If I would've seen the full movie, I probably would've found this less in quality. But standing on its own, it really does get laughs despite a few inexcusable inconsistencies. It's a respectable, yet not strong enough Hollywood debut by actor Emile Hirsch, who I still believe will go on and do some brilliant things in his lifetime.Starring: Emile Hirsch, Elisha Cuthbert, Timothy Olyphant, Paul Dano, Chris Marquette, Timothy Bottoms, and Donna Bullock.

Ted," Brings us back to laughing at something just because
","After nearly claiming ownership of the 'Animation Domination' lineup Sunday nights on Fox, Seth MacFarlane makes the leap to the theatrical stage with Ted, which has the marketing concept and appearance of Winnie the Pooh with all the innocence squeezed out of him. The character, Ted, is unabashedly crude, and every time he speaks, you feel the need to take a bath. He utters some of the most foul and disgusting lines any film character has said this year.And yet, I laughed. Again, I'm not proud of what I laughed at, but I did. Ted is the funniest raunchy comedy we've been given this year, and MacFarlane proves he can extend his wit for an upwards of one-hundred minutes. He's created three animated programs and while Ted sometimes feels like it might drum up a forth one, but I don't believe that's the goal here. It appears that this was an idea MacFarlane had floating around in his head for a while, couldn't find a way to make it work on any of his three shows, needed the theatrical freedom and liberation to do and say whatever he wanted to, and thus, penned a screenplay with two others, and created a comedic exercise similar to one by Judd Apatow, but with the additional element of pleasant fantasy.MacFarlane has been put down by remarks that he is too heavily reliant on pop culture references and presents us with characters we can never take seriously. I don't believe he has ever been credited for being strangely sentimental in his programs, and has the skill to create a setup, a climax, a solution, and even unrelated cutaway gags his shows are known for, in the matter of twenty-two minutes weekly. His talent deserves recognition, and I believe Ted is nothing but faithful to his name.In 1985, in Boston, eight-year-old John Bennett was a lonely kid who wished for a close friend to have and trust. When his parents bought him a stuffed teddy bear for Christmas, he wished that the bear would come alive, and miraculously, it did. The bear, named Ted by John, went on to be a celebrity, yet never forgot his first and best pal. The narrator then tells us that just like Corey Feldman, Frankie Muniz, and Justin Bieber, eventually, nobody gave a s***.Twenty-seven years later, John (played by Mark Wahlberg) and Ted (voiced by MacFarlane) spend their days in an apartment, watching movies and cartoons, particularly Flash Gordon, smoking a bong and eating junk food. John is a used car salesman, who has been dating the beautiful Lori (Mila Kunis) for four years, yet is reluctant to propose. She likes Ted, but feels John has been too clingy with childish things that need to go. John is indecisive about choosing the love of his life or his friend he promised he'd be with for life. The setup isn't too far from one possibly existing between long-dating couples with a human who has become too intrusive.Despite given free range as well, MacFarlane doesn't immediately jump on the 'TnA' bandwagon, or even the gross-out gags wagon either. Frankly, the only wagon he jumps on is the appropriate one; unrestricted verbal wit. He reconnects us with familiar faces and voices, with Mila Kunis ('Meg' on Family Guy) in the supporting role, his 'Peter Griffin' voice as Ted's (it doesn't come off as distracting as Seth Rogen's in Paul), and even the voice of the handicap character, 'Joe,' from Family Guy, Patrick Warburton, is given a minor role in the picture. It keenly reminds me of how Trey Parker and Matt Stone utilize their recognizable voices in their films that are distant from their South Park comfort-zone. Between the verbal wit and the pleasant familiarities, MacFarlane still gives himself enough leeway to function within his newly found theatrical boundaries, without resorting to childish gag jokes.But let's not forget Wahlberg and Kunis in the central roles. If there's one actor who has efficiently restored himself from goofy kid to a capable character, it's Wahlberg. He, along with many other actors this year, such as Channing Tatum in 21 Jump Street, have touched on the comedy genre and have proved worthy of recognition. Wahlberg and the foul-mouthed bear have a kind bromance in the picture that manages to carry itself through the entire film, never running out of steam or resorting to tireless old fluff (no pun intended). Kunis, per usual, is exuberant in her role, providing character where there is usually caricature, and proves her determination and stunning appearance take her further than many other actresses that are on the same, or even a higher, level.After seeing the film, I contemplated my thoughts on if many of the references, jokes, or one-liners would be as funny if they came from a human character, and the answer is probably not. They probably would've triggered laughs, but not the riotous ones this picture gets. It is next to impossible to rewrite Ted with a human character in the bear's place, and second, the film resorts back to that old formula of laughing at something just because. Seeing a human swear, drink, smoke, and act crass in public is typical, but seeing a bear do it all is touchingly hilarious, when done properly. Especially when it is done with a wide range and an enormous heart. I believe it's safe to say Ted is the first big comedy hit of the year.Starring: Mark Wahlberg, Mila Kunis, Seth MacFarlane, Joel McHale, Giovanni Ribisi, Jessica Stroup, and Patrick Warburton. Directed by: Seth MacFarlane.",9,7,18,30 June 2012
Oldboy," Leaves you with a taste for more. Or maybe that's just blood.
","Oldboy is an artfully-done thriller, mixing slickness with directorial lyricism and more than touch of brutality to create a mesmerizing film about revenge, destiny, and closure. Ostensibly, this is another film tackling familiar themes with the predictable sameness. But thanks to the trio of writers' willingness to incorporate twists into the story, director Park Chan-wook mastering elements of intrigue and unsettling fright, and cinematographer Chung-hoon Chung's beautifully seamy visuals, the film is one to behold, absorb, and contemplate.The story revolves around Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik), a businessman who is kidnapped the night of his daughter's birthday party in 1988 and trapped in a room that mirrors the likes of a hotel room. His only contact with the outside world is a Television, where he learns of his wife's murder and that he is a prime suspect. Dae-su doesn't know, however, that this room will be his home for the next fifteen years. To pass the time, Dae-su practices boxing, plots revenge against his killers, pens a will of sorts, and attempts to escape by tunneling through the brick wall.In 2003, he is inexplicably drugged and released in the middle of a grassy field, trapped inside a suitcase, with no explanation of why he was held captive, who held him captive, and why he was randomly released. Dae-su, who no longer has a family or relatives, does the only thing he can do - wander around the streets of South Korea. Soon after his release, he meets a female sushi chef Mi-do (Kang Hye-jung), a gentle, vulnerable woman who feels sorry for Dae-su and his circumstances. The two begin a relationship, despite Dae-su's questionable mental health state, and both try to find the people that imprisoned him for fifteen years.Park Chan-wook doesn't make us sympathize or even side with Dae-su in any particular way. His camera simply remains on him, allowing us to think of him as a victim or someone who potentially deserved this imprisonment. Regardless, we want to know right off the bat why this is happening because the idea is baffling on many levels. But even with a solid mystery at hand, Chan-wook throws in revenge and romance elements, making Oldboy a pretty complete package in terms of juggling multiple, difficult genres, especially when they all need to work together to create an entire film. Chan-wook devotes enough attention to each element of the story, emphasizing on intrigue and devaluing the unnecessary, and with Chung's cinematography working to elevate the look and tone of the picture, Oldboy is nothing shy of immersing on a story and visual level.There are issues I take with the story, however. To begin with, we don't get to experience enough of the agony Dae-su does when he's locked in the room for fifteen years. A good chunk of the film (say, maybe thirty minutes or so) should've been devoted to the monotony and hell of living inside a random place, being beaten, repeatedly drugged, and manipulated for no clear reason. Instead, only about fifteen minutes are spent inside that hotel-room and we see fifteen years skate by in montage. Another issue is, by the end, specifically during the final confrontation, the scene includes laughable dialog and one particular instance I simply cannot accept, even considering how desperate the lead character is.Despite the issues, the inevitable intrigue and mystery set forth by the story itself make the film worth seeing simply on those merits. Thrillers come and go, especially ones that boast nothing more than star-power and droning action sequences. Oldboy, on the contrary, lingers in your system, and since its release in 2003, sent shockwaves around the world, introducing people to Korean cinema more so than any other film from the country. The film is brash, thoughtful, and pleasantly excessive, and leaves one with an appetite for more of the same material. Or maybe that's just blood.Starring: Choi Min-sik, Kang Hye-jung, and Yoo Ji-tae. Directed by: Park Chan-wook.",9,0,5,6 January 2014
Spider-Man 2," With a brain in its head and style on its side, this is one hell of a ride
","Spider-Man 2 is an adrenaline-packed cinematic delight. A purely functioning superhero film, serving as a sequel to a film that was surprisingly capable after spending a fourth of a century in development hell. Not only is this one of the best sequels I have yet to see, but one of the strongest superhero epics of the decade.What little Raimi and the writers neglected in the original Spider-Man film is injected into this sequel with full-force intelligence, depth, and attitude. Certain action scenes are so artfully designed and professionally crafted, it appears they could serve as the long-awaited climax in any film of the genre. Scenes themselves play like epics within an epic and some, like the infamous train sequence, are so breakneck and excessive they could use an intermission.But Spider-Man 2 doesn't have time for preposterous breaks or intermissions. They would disrupt the flow of poetry the film so effortlessly excels at, and for that matter, it is too busy furthering Peter Parker's entertaining story and fueling its action scenes with the coherency and structure they need. The film takes place two years after the events of the first film. We see Parker is still doing vigilante justice around the city of New York, yet we see he is breathlessly struggling to juggle his alter-ego's duties, his schoolwork, his freelance photography job, and his own free time. Because of this, he has long been distant from the love of his life, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and his best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco).Now that Harry is the leader of Oscorp, he has been funding research for the nuclear scientist, Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina). Octavius's goal is to perfect fusion power, and he creates and operates a harness equipped with several long, windy robotic arms that seem to take on a mind of their own. Unfortunately, due to a series of disasters, the arms are now sewn to his spinal-cord and have corrupted his mind and are now influencing his decisions and actions. Dr. Octavius, who will later be known as 'Doc Ock,' serves as the main villain in the story, as one can expect.Parker not only must try and defeat Doc Ock, but must figure out how to get his spidey-legs working again after numerous web malfunctions, and has just learned that Mary Jane is engaged to an acclaimed astronaut. And don't even get him started about how he must continue to comfort his Aunt May, who is still grieving over the loss of her husband and Peter's uncle, as well as telling her the real truth about his death.Speaking as a sizable fan of the original Spider-Man, the one part I mentioned in my review was that Raimi showed Parker's newly-discovered powers to be all fun and games with no consequences or brewing agony. It was a chockablock of excitement for him, and never once did the story showcase how these powers would've inevitably burdened Parker with a barrage of responsibility and tribulations. It almost seems Raimi and the writers left that part out on purpose, so they could center the sequel primarily around the agony of being a superhero. If that was their plan, their have succeeded, because not only is this one of the most riveting and entertaining superhero films, it is also one of the deepest.Tobey Maguire, returning as Parker, bleeds charm and confidence in the role of a character that just has the charm part down. With the new Amazing Spider-Man film just released about two weeks ago, boasting the relatively new star Andrew Garfield in the central role, I can't help but remind readers who I believe is the real Peter Parker. Maguire's Parker has mastered the role of a shy nerd who lacks any and all confidence. Garfield's character was still in that nerd-position, but he was far more secure in his witticisms and his confidence. To me, Peter Parker is and always will be a nerd. Regardless of how tight and brazen his costume is.When it came down to the villain of the original Spider-Man, unlike many people, I was satisfied that it was the Green Goblin. If anything, Willem Dafoe portrayed the character in a lot more of an eerie light than I assume many others actors would've. Doc Ock is a more impressive villain in every sense. Quite possibly one of the most enticing to watch on screen. The Goblin, no matter which way you examine him, is a rather stock villain. Ock's robotic arms make for a never-ending line of possibilities and events, and the action sequences involving him are stylish and crafty, perfectly complimenting the film itself as a whole.Spider-Man 2 is a shivering example at what makes a great superhero film. It shows us what most of us want, which is explicitly entertaining action scenes, and the something extra I hope most of us crave, which is the humanity and exploration of the character. To show Parker's powers as a burden to him was a brilliant move on screenwriter Alvin Sargent's part (who would later go on to write the third part of this franchise and be one of the three to construct the new one) and Sam Raimi's. With a brain in its head and style on its side, this is one hell of a ride.Starring: Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Alfred Molina, Rosemary Harris, and Donna Murphy.

127 Hours," It's amazing what goes through your head when you can't feel your arm.
","127 Hours is a shockingly true story about Aron Ralston (Franco) who ventures out to the Blue John Canyon without telling anyone his whereabouts. The unthinkable happens when he falls down a canyon and his arm become pinned by a boulder. He is trapped down there for five days struggling to survive going through some desperate measures one should never have to contemplate.I've heard many say 127 is stupid, and just a boring film. They obviously have no appreciation for great scenery and a very involved soundtrack. The film is scored by Slumdog Millionaire's A.R. Rahman. Rahman is perhaps most famous from his song Jai Ho, which is a great motivating song. He scores this movie to perfection and intensity.In a way I have sympathy for Ralston, and I don't. You're not the brightest of bulbs if you go out to a canyon and bring or tell no one. I wouldn't go within a hundred feet of a canyon or mountain. I damn sure wouldn't do it alone. But Ralston begins to become delusional and hallucinate about past relationship and his family members. He realizes he never appreciated life or anything in it. He does the unthinkable and amputates his harm with a dull pocket-knife.The amputation scene was not what I expected. I expected it to be extremely gory, gruesome, and disgustingly unwatchable. It was pretty graphic, but not as graphic as I had hoped. It hardly made me cringe. Still very well done effect wise, just not as good as it's hype.James Franco deserved the Best Actor Oscar most definitely. I haven't seen The King's Speech, but Collin Firth must've truly been something to beat Franco to the Oscar. He might not be Oscar material as a host, but he sure was it as an actor.Is 127 Hours an autobiography? A documentary? A drama? Or maybe a 'docudrama.' It is an up close, in your face look at fear and hopelessness, and the closest thing you will get to that painful five days. It's almost like a documentary within a drama film. Something I've rarely seen. Further shows why Boyle's 127 Hours is a masterpiece on film.Starring: James Franco. Directed by: Danny Boyle.",10,0,2,12 March 2011
"I Love You, Man"," I like you, bro
","I Love You, Man tackles a weirdly forgotten problem in the world and that is the grown male with little to no male friends, or friends in general. Work dominates much of our adult lives and free time has become something we choose to make rather than something that comes included with our work. Some of us don't have the kind of time we want to do simple things like hang out, read, or grab drinks after work. I see this issue more prominent in America than people see.Here's a probable scenario brought forth in John Hamburg's I Love You, Man. Peter Klaven (Paul Rudd) is the kind of man I described above, about to marry the wonderful Zooey Rice (Rashida Jones) and working as a real-estate agent. However, when he overhears Zooey and her friends talking about how guys like Peter, who really have no male friends, may become clingy and needy to their woman, Peter states bluntly and without reservation, 'I need to get some f****** friends.' So he tries. He tries to bond with his gay brother's friends at the gym, to little avail. He even tries to bond with some of his wife's friends' husbands to try and get on their good side. It isn't until he meets the offbeat but well-meaning investor Sydney Fife (Jason Segel) at an open house for his client Lou Ferigno. Sydney tells Peter the only reason he is at this particular open house is to take advantage of the free food and the abundance of divorcees that frequent these kinds of gatherings.Peter and Sydney strike up a bond that is almost immediate, both around the same age, both quirky in their own way, and each balancing each other out - Peter being straight-laced and awkward, Sydney being quick-witted and free-spirited. Peter is convinced he has met his best man, but Zooey thinks otherwise, as the wedding date nears and Peter spends little time with her.The film rests on the chemistry its actors provide, a typical trait of raunchy comedies from this time period. Rudd and Segel are fun-loving guys, and their buddy-buddy conversations and activities together will possible rekindle the memories of a man's best man or, for younger or unmarried souls, find a bit of themselves and their best friend in these characters. A scene at a Rush concert where Peter and Sydney are singing the band's song 'Limelight' loudly and pretending to play their instruments (as well as engaging in some hilariously off-color behavior) is a prime example of the hilarity that ensues when two friends get together. The person that brings the child out in you. You can age and mature for many years but as soon as you see that person, you become your childish self again.The only issue I found with the film is that the material here seems more well-suited for a drama than a comedy. It wouldn't surprise me if writers Hamburg and Larry Levin recognized this early on, in addition. The reason being is that the second half of the film overdoes Peter's awkward phone conversations with Sydney and uncomfortable actions in general to the point where we think Peter is either socially inept beyond belief or has some sort of condition. By the end of the film, that seems to be the only card the film knows how to play.Because of this, the humor gets redundant. How often must we watch a man make an idiot of himself to the point where we laugh at him more than with him? Had the second half become more fixated on the drama and the realizations of marriage and friendlessness, there would've been something even more subversive than the material at hand.As it stands, I Love You, Man is a fun film, a break from the comedies with big actors that fail to deliver, and one that proposes a problem that I still believe is more prominent than people think. However, this is a rare case of a smart film unfortunately not being smart enough, but it's just smart enough to succeed and be rewarding entertainment.Starring: Paul Rudd, Jason Segel, Rashida Jones, Lou Ferigno, and Andy Samberg.

Superbad," One teenage comedy with extra wit and soul
","Superbad is a parable of values and friendship, reminding us that a good and earnest moral upbringing will be able to safely glide us through life and make us achieve happiness much easier. Its characters are well-mannered and sweet, not to mention inherently likable, as well as everything being morally correct and admirable.Now onto the real review. Superbad is a shamelessly raunchy R-rated comedy with more four letter words than a Webster dictionary. Again, this sounds like the introduction I'd give a poorly rated film. By no means is Superbad a bad comedy. It is a smart, witty, and factual teen movie side-stepping clichÃ©s and underwritten primary characters, while at the same time remaining funny and entertaining until the end.2007 was the year where Judd Apatow took off. He gained attention in 2005 with The 40 Year Old Virgin, but pretty much garnered a household name with this and Knocked Up, both starring Seth Rogen. It wouldn't surprise me to hear that Superbad is an autobiography, since the writers of the film, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, share the same names as the lead actors. Maybe that could be why this feels so sentimental and close to home. Or maybe it's because Superbad is aware what kind of unsettling situations high school can put you through and knows how to document them in a fun way.The film centers around loudmouth pervert Seth (Hill) and self-conscious, paranoia-stricken Evan (Cera) as they endure their last few weeks of being high schoolers before they are shipped off to separate colleges. Seth and Evan have been friends for years, and are tired of the fact that their separate ways have been the talk of their parents and friends.Seth has a crush on the recently-popular Jules (Stone), a beautiful redhead, who trusts him with supplying alcohol for her party. Evan has a crush on Becca (MacIsaac), a sweet and simple girl who agrees to meet up with him at Jules' upcoming party as well. In order to purchase the alcohol, both Seth and Evan trust their pal Fogel (Mintz-Plasse), who plans to acquire a fake ID. Because of this ID, Fogel now becomes his fake name, 'McLovin,' a name that has garnered much fame on the web.The night unfolds into a chaotic spectacle of unprecedented stature, so much so that I won't go into explaining the routes and acts of desperation the characters take in order to be liked, admired, or even noticed. Fogel winds up teaming up with two police officers (Hader and Rogen) who act more like the bad guys rather than good guys. This setup and sort of topsy-tursvy treatment of character roles create limitless comedic possibilities, most of which are well utilized.But what truly makes the film work is its level of realism and intelligence. It has wit, and puts it to use. The writing and acting captures the awkwardness of the teenage lifestyle with pinpoint accuracy, at the same time makes it fun and painful to witness. I can think of quite a few films that allow their characters to thrive on ego and self-interest, with no redeeming qualities. Here, the characters in Superbad just want to fit in and achieve the girl of their dreams, but shallow stereotypes and one stutter too many prevent this goal from happening.Superbad is quite a rarity; a funny, good-natured comedy focusing on things of the immoral nature. Just like with American Pie, too many people believe these films are just raucous sex comedies with no substance, soul, or charm. The characters are likable and charismatic, and lack the oh-so-typical nihilistic, 'I just want to have sex with anything that moves' mentality. Some may be surprised at the level of nuanced emotional instances the film reaches. The performances are fun, the writing is polished and witty, and the antics never seem to go over the top. It's too bad the women roles in the film feel a tad underwritten. Hopefully we have something like Supergood to explore that angle sometime soon.Starring: Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Bill Hader, Seth Rogen, Emma Stone, and Martha MacIsaac.

Creed," An elegant film with humanity, musicality, and a respect for its titular character
","If you would've told me Ryan Coogler, the director of 'Fruitvale Station,' would've been to helm the production of 'Creed,' a 'Rocky' spin off that focused on the son of Rocky Balboa's original opponent Apollo Creed, I would've undoubtedly laughed at you. Now here I am writing a review of another Rocky-centered film in 2015 helmed by two of the greatest, yet most unsung talents of the 2010's. 'Fruitvale Station' remains one of the most thoughtful and underseen films of this decade, and Coogler and Jordan seem to realize that they will need to throw bigger punches (pun intended) and make more noise in order to get themselves noticed. The result is 'Creed,' a wonderful throwback to the principles, emotional authenticity, and the layered characters that made the original 'Rocky' film so special and so renowned, even to this day.The film revolves around Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan), the illegitimate kid of acclaimed fighter Apollo Creed, who died shortly before his father's birth. In and out of foster care for years, and with a few bouts of juvenile detention where he learned to fight, Adonis is finally taken in by Apollo's widow (Phylicia Rashād) when Adonis's biological mother winds up dying. Despite her advice, Adonis wants to train to become a fighter like his father, for it's practically all he has known to do his whole life.Living on the cold, unfriendly streets of Philadelphia, Adonis looks towards boxing legend Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) for training tips and pointers as he climbs his way to face 'Pretty' Ricky Conlan (Tony Bellew), a talented, but troubled, British light heavyweight champion who has never been knocked down once. A lot of factors play into Adonis's quest for a win, however, including Rocky becoming unexpectedly sick, his alter-ego 'Donnie Johnson' being exposed as a cover-up to hide the Creed name, and his infatuation with his neighbor Bianca (Tessa Thompson), a singer who is becoming progressively deaf.Though it's a bit bizarre to make it the primary note of a boxing film, it must be stated how well Coogler and cinematographer Maryse Alberti choreograph the two boxing matches in this film, with the first being the prime cinematic achievement. The first boxing match in 'Creed' is conducted in one long take, almost mirroring the kind of coherency and flow of a meticulous dance-number. Pauses and breaks have Coogler's camera rushing over to profile the opposing corners before plunging back into the action accordingly. It is during the boxing scenes that Coogler decides to focus on facial expressions; everything from game faces, to poker faces, to faces with unfathomable injuries when round eight or nine rolls around. The result is a film that flows in its editing (thanks to both Claudia Castello and Michael P. Shawver) with a certain, elegant musicality.Coogler's love for facial expressions is shown throughout the film, however, even during casual scenes, like Adonis and Bianca going on their first date or him and Rocky having a heart-to-heart. Such a focus shows the tender side of Coogler, and in a physically and mentally arduous sport like boxing, human emotions can something get traded for the adrenaline and sheer rush of energy that comes through in the scenes of the actual sport.Thankfully Coogler and Jordan work to make the film deeply predicated off of Creed's person and personality. Both men already took a real-life person who has been shortchanged to the poster-child victim of unnecessary police brutality and showed how every day events in life can shape our personalities in 'Fruitvale Station,' so it's not particularly surprising to see how the two men made this film with a considerable human angle. Michael B. Jordan gives yet another strong performance, filled with dramatic urgency that has me predicting at least an Oscar nomination for the incredible young star in the next ten years. Perhaps the most surprising performance of the hour, however, comes from the likes of Stallone, who adds a great emotional layer to the story thanks to his natural presence and grace. Stallone comfortably slips back into his Rocky character with ease and a desire to play the character as an aging legend, selflessly helping the son of a rival/friend without a very evident cheeky edge to the material. It's one of Stallone's finest performances in years.'Creed' may not be as gritty of as hard to watch as this year's 'Southpaw,' but it doesn't really need to be. Unlike 'Southpaw,' which showed the pain-ridden personal side to boxing, 'Creed' shows the triumphant side of celebrating a win and training, in addition to the negative side of being dragged down because of something you cannot control - your namesake. During the last fight, I heard emphatic cheers from the audience as if they were watching a UFC fight at the theater and not a Hollywood film. Just like I said about 'Southpaw,' boxing films are special in the realm of film because, if done right, they almost blur the line of cinema and reality in terms of the way they depict the sport, and often inspire and uproot our richest adrenaline to prompt such heavy reactions. 'Creed' deserves its reactions.",9,4,8,29 November 2015
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," An origin-story, an action spectacle, and a critique of age-old philosophy
","I'm not sure mainstream audiences realize how massive the X-Men library of characters really is. I am informed by my close friends, many of whom are enthusiasts in early comic books, that the X-Men character roster stretches a mile wide and one cannot watch a few films of the X-Men franchise and expect to know all the characters of the series, let alone a select few in great detail.It is precisely this reason why I feel that the idea of an X-Men Origins series being made is not such a bad idea, although with the middling reception and box office returns that Wolverine managed to recoup, I feel the studios are thinking differently. The X-Men film franchise has a sizable job of introducing a variety of new characters and villains along with giving them some sort of identification past their superpowers and throwing a conflict at them that they need to solve (or attempt to, at least) in the course of a film. Just the latter obligation is so heavy that it distracts from the other two points. Giving several X-Men characters their own film showing their beginnings and their development on a more personal basis would allow for more character resonation and depth, but also allow the films to spend more time developing stories and villains rather than trying to cram (or completely disregard) the film's core heroes last minute.Gavin Hood's X-Men Origins: Wolverine has a few missteps in terms of CGI, but on a story basis, it is wholly interesting and easy to sink into. Opening in 1845, it tells the story of Wolverine's beginnings as James Howlett, a young boy who sees his father killed right before his eyes. These combined feelings of anger and sadness that wash over him activate his mutation of having long, metal claws that extend out of his knuckles, killing the man who killed his father only to realize that the man he killed was his father.James flees his home with the man's son Victor Creed who grows up to be Liev Schreiber, while James grows up to be Hugh Jackman. The two wind up being dedicated soldiers for the next century, fighting in the American Civil War, both World War I and II, and the Vietnam War, before killing their senior officer and being sentenced to death, which they both survive. Together, they are approached by William Stryker (Danny Huston) to work for Team X, a mutant organization, to which they both accept before James leaves after six years being disillusioned with the entire process.To go on ruins the fun of watching Wolverine's life unfold, which is interesting in itself. Jackman has gone from embodying the aura of Wolverine to quickly becoming the character, portraying him in many different lights, from emotional, to strong-willed, to violent, to uncontrollable, to vulnerable, and so forth. Jackman is assisted here by Schreiber, who manages to work with him to create an entertaining partnership that is less about buddy-buddy charisma but more about two men stuck together and bound by what seems to be a curse.X-Men Origins: Wolverine lacks the clear love and affection for the material that director Bryan Singer delivered, along with being burdened by some poor CGI/green-screen work here and there, but the film is also missing the downright awful dialog that was present in X-Men: The Last Stand. Writers David Benioff (who wrote Troy and went on to write several episodes for HBO's breakout hit Game of Thrones) and Skip Woods forgo the abundance of useless one-liners for drama, and director Gavin Hood changes pace from directing South African dramas (including the incredible Tsotsi) to a film that allegedly has more depth than one initially would think.Hood comments on X-Men Origins: Wolverine's possible political side by saying, 'Any movie that is simply about good versus evil...is in my view putting out into the world and certainly into a mass audience and young audience's mind a rather dangerous philosophy, which is that there is good and evil in the simplistic and easily defined way. I think that for the last eight years, we've had that philosophy very much prevalent in the Bush administration that if you're on the side of good, at least as you perceive it, then you can do no evil. That's what's so great about this character or about this movie for me and why I wanted to do it. This is a guy who recognizes his own capacity for evil and I think that's exciting in a sort of popular culture kind of way.' Because Hood recognizes Wolverine's deeper side and delivers it in a way that is critiquing of age-old philosophy, we get a film that subsequently gives us a more enriching endeavor than your average superhero film.Starring: Hugh Jackman, Liev Schreiber, Danny Huston, Dominic Monaghan, and Ryan Reynolds.

Hot Fuzz," Genre revisionism at its most brazen
","The difficultly to define Edgar Wright's Hot Fuzz is one of the things that makes Hot Fuzz such a fun and original film. It very much finds itself at a crossroads of genres rather than operating in one specific realm of cinematic classification. If you simply bill the film as a comedy, despite it largely being one, you're neglecting to mention the excessive amounts of violence that often isn't played for laughs, the immense amount of action spectacle, and even the mystery and crime element essential to the plot. If you simply call it a crime film (being that 'action' isn't one of the six main genres), you dismiss the ubiquitous elements of parody and satire that bleed through nearly every scene of the film.The film focuses on the incredibly serious police officer Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg), who is working with his bumbling partner Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) in order to investigate exactly why and how the town of Stanford has went more than two decades without a murder, yet the town always seems to be caught up in little accidents that find its citizens killed. The two embark on a journey that involves corruption, secret groups, and unfathomable bloodshed all while trying to uphold the integrity Stanford still has in itself and its name.The way I see it, Hot Fuzz is an amalgamation of comedy and crime, and maybe with a sprinkle of horror. The comedy is largely classifiable as screwball, as it's largely bent on dialog and the idea that everybody but Simon Pegg's Officer Nicholas Angel character is the only serious soul in a sea of bumbling and blissfully ignorant buffoons. The crime element largely stems from the inherent mystery as to why the town of Stanford has remained murder/crime-free for an upwards of two decades, and that core mystery is what kicks the plot into motion. The aforementioned horror elements are very sporadic, but largely stem from the execution of the murders, which largely disrupt the flow of the film, regardless of what genre it was working towards in the momentary. The murder scenes are often abrupt and occupied by vicious bloodshed that turns the film from a goofy comedy into a vicious and violent picture.Speaking in a descriptive sense - one that has the film operating in a very subversive sense - Hot Fuzz largely occupies a fictitious world, where characters occasionally act as if they're too dumb to function like normal human beings. Consider the over-dramatized reactions of much of the townspeople of Stanford, specifically the officials who are keeping the murders a secret. They are broadly drawn caricatures where, in a more conventional crime film, they'd be slicker, more believable, and more passable as key players in a conspiracy movement. With that, the writing team of Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright (and occasionally Nick Frost with the other two installments of the Cornetto Trilogy), there is an emphasis on merging genres that allow for broad, satirical comedy in addition to gruesome bloodshed. The excessive, unrelenting violence in 'Hot Fuzz' is noteworthy being that it often comes after some witty dialog or situational humor. This creates a very evident narrative dichotomy that emphasizes revisionist principles in terms of merging genres rather than sticking to one particular genre.Speaking in a prescriptive sense - one that has the film adhering to conventions and preconceived genre formulas - Hot Fuzz abides by comedic conventions by way of dialog, a common approach in satire. Consider the scene when Nicholas speaks to the older woman and she randomly shouts 'Fascist!' towards Nicholas, stopping him in his tracks before realizing she is filling in a box on her crossword puzzle. The same trope is used when Nicholas says 'hag,' referring to another answer on the woman's crossword puzzle, despite the fact that Nicholas utters it like he's referring to her. This is a fairly recognizable attempt at comedy – the classic misunderstanding to us, the audience, between the characters in the film. Comedic convention also arises from the fact that characters are put in a situation they'd rather not be in, or one that's precarious to their safety, well-being, or specific morals. Nicholas Angel being paired up with Nick Frost's Danny Butterman, a goofy but well-meaning police officer, adheres to comedic convention because the two are polar opposites; Angel is stern and self-sufficient whereas Butterman is the more roly-poly type of cop who often seems in it for the fun.For the crime aspect, despite Hot Fuzz, in a way, rebelling against the conventions of buddy-cop comedies by having the two mismatched leads discover and infiltrate a conspiracy, the film does indeed play by the genre's tropes. In the end, the bad guys are violently defeated, the two leads learn to embrace what makes one another unique and their own person, and two men we've followed since the beginning of the film come out on top. This is a very classical element in a film that, in many ways, is largely revisionist. However, in order to incorporate the new, you need to have some of the old, which is why the descriptive aspect of the film is just as important as its more descriptive aspects.Above all, it's the ridiculousness and the sheer outlandish premise that draws us to Hot Fuzz; there's a magnetic sense of urgency that attaches us to the characters and their personalities from the start. Seeing one character, who is stern and serious, alongside a goofier archetype both get into sticky situations no matter how hard they try, is one that, when taken here, feels fun and fresh thanks to Pegg and Wright's variety of situational humor. Hot Fuzz is very much genre revisionism, and in a prescriptive sense, it's a film that emphasizes its differences from the comedy, crime, and action genre rather than the conventions of the aforementioned genres that it abides by throughout the course of the film.",8,0,0,5 November 2015
Rise of the Guardians," Arguably the best Jack Frost ever portrayed on film, but...
","Perhaps my long-term interest in horror films involving Santa Claus that predicate off of the fear of the holiday season is my reason for not enjoying Rise of the Guardians as much as I believe I should've. It's a pretty movie, with lively colors, familiar characters, and beautifully created scenery, but pairing iconic figures such as the Easter Bunny, Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy, and, more or less, Jack Frost and the Sandman, together seemed to be a creative idea that didn't gel well on screen.This is largely due to the direction of the film, which takes the story with a grain of salt, not providing enough true imagination into the settings and the characters in general, and making its leads, especially the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus, into drab, cynical beings with very few characteristics that can be redeemed in a meaningful way.The story concerns the spirit of winter himself, Jack Frost (voiced by Chris Pine), who recounts his eternal life that began centuries ago after being summoned by the Man in the Moon. It then goes into the details on how Santa Claus (Alec Baldwin), leader of the Guardians along with the Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher), the Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman), and the Sandman, is at a loss to try and defeat Pitch the Bogeyman (Jude Law), and appoints Jack Frost as the new Guardian to help the four attempt to defeat the force of darkness/evil.This storyline is a little less than compelling to say the least. Often times, the film is distracted by manic chase sequences that show off the colors of the film rather than its depth and characters. Rise of the Guardians is The Avengers for the little-ones, but the film seldom treats the material as anything more than a simple timewaster. Yet the film has some wonderfully animated sequences, such as the sequence where the Guardians are swerving on the sleigh, or even when they are all paired together in a little boy's room, hoping to make it out of their alive.Certain little instances that punctuate the ninety-seven minute excursion are fun and lively, but the story as a whole is comprised of parts that don't fit so perfectly well. Kids may like it, although they may need to hit that five and up level before seeking this one out. It's mildly amusing and occasionally impressive visually, but it's unfortunate that the characters here are presented in such a gloomy, uninspired tone. Think about it; why must the Easter Bunny be portrayed as an Aussie warrior with a dreary outlook on life? Voiced by: Chris Pine, Alec Baldwin, Hugh Jackman, Isla Fisher, and Jude Law.

Troy," T(r)oying with the original story a bit too much
","When making a film based on Homer's timeless Epic called The Illiad comes forth a mass amount of potential. Great story, engaging characters, brutally intense fighting scenes, in depth costume design, accurate historical facts, and one hell of a love story are all things that should be in the 2004 Troy. Pretty much the only thing the film manages to be superior in is the costume design, while the rest of the film is occupied by semi developed, partially false character development, false information, and a poor computer generated army of a false number of warriors fighting to the death. What a letdown.To be fair, Troy has upsides. The Trojan War is confusing because there are so many characters and you have to pay attention to detail which may be hard if your interest on the subject isn't too high. The Trojan War is a topic of some interest to me, but this movie was something I'd expect to be great and memorable. Sadly, I doubt a good Trojan War movie will come for quite sometime. After this big budget mediocre film I don't think people want to jump on The Trojan War wagon too soon.In The Illiad, Paris gave Helen, the Goddess of beauty, an apple and took her away from her home of Troy which erupted a war that dragged on for many years. In the movie the same sort of thing occurs, but the nail that seals the coffin is that there are no Gods in the entire film. Sure occasionally someone will say 'May the Gods be with you', but Zeus, Poseidon, and all the other Gods are never uttered by any character in this entire film. Director Wolfgang Peterson, to my knowledge, never gave a legitimate reason why he chose to make Gods absent from Troy. My guess is the story is already complicated enough and to add Gods in would confuse the average movie goer. Not to mention the fact that some characters personalities are combined into one in this film made for the good old 'composite character' term so adding Gods to a complicated recipe will give spice no average Joe wants.Some say it was best to exclude the Gods, but I say that if it ain't broke, don't fix it. If you want to make a respectful adaptation you need to follow the original story line. I understand wanting to do your own thing, but when you tackle a monster sized project like this and you want to change things up, maybe you should make YOUR OWN version of the film, how you see it. Don't bring an unfaithful adaptation of one of the most famous stories of all time.Acting wise, Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom aren't horrible in the film, but it's almost like their biceps were the true reason for their roles. Of course Achilles (Pitt) is known for his strength and strong fighting skills, but c'mon anymore abs in this film and it's the final Twilight film.One last small annoyance of the film is the God awful exaggerated armies that consist of mostly CGI. When one watches the special effects bonus features, which are way more interesting than the movie, it shows how the film was made and how the effects came full. Clearly they were being lazy and added CGI armies in last. They used around 150 real guys and then when they sat at a computer screen they cloned the guys numerous times to create mass armies that are unrealistic anyway. If The Trojan War really did have these many soldiers it would be like twice the population of Greece at the time.For what it's worth Troy is superior with it's costume design, but thats pretty much it. The five stars goes in the regard to some of the actors like Bloom, Pitt, Cox (Agamemnon), and the late and great Peter O'Toole (Priam) who is fantastic in pretty much everything and the costume design. The story could have lived up to be so much more. We could have been delivered a masterpiece war film with engaging characters, lighting fast fights, and a satisfying feel and memorable approach to The Trojan War. What we got was a forgettable, undone collage of rushed effects, and a miserable unidentified explanation to why the Gods are absent. Whoever said 'nothings perfect' will no regret a syllable when they see Troy.Starring: Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, Diane Kruger, Owain Yeoman, Brian Cox, Sean Bean, Julie Christie, and Peter O'Toole.

Dead Poets Society," The good and the bad fight to create a mixed bag
","I can look at Peter Weir's Dead Poets Society from two different lenses and come to two different conclusions based on them. The first lens sees a mawkish production, one looking to inflate its emotional climax by ways of theatrics and erect a film largely founded off of vague characters, common clichés, and quotes pulled from a broad spectrum of deceased poets. I'd assign that film two stars. However, my opposite view sees the film as a production tackling themes of self-discovery and enrichment along with aspirations over obligations, utilizing quotes pulled from a broad spectrum of deceased poets to its advantage. I'd assign that film four stars. The issue is I can't see one lens at a time, without the other covering it, as everything I've stated exists in this film to some degree. I'm compromising at three stars and going from there.The story revolves around Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard), Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke), Knox Overstreet (Josh Charles), Charlie Dalton (Gale Hansen), Richard Cameron (Dylan Kussman), Steven Meeks (Allelon Ruggiero), and Gerard Pitts (James Waterston), high school seniors at the prestigious prep school Welton Academy, a school boasting the typical prep school philosophy of honor, excellence, and education. It is looking to be another year of mundane lameness for the boys until they meet their English literature teacher, Mr. John Keating (Robin Williams), who preaches the philosophy of 'carpe diem' and informs them that they may refer to him as 'O captain! My captain!' Immediately, he touches these students in a way they've never been touched before. The class that was once a bore to them has now become an outlet for expression and personal enrichment, along with providing them with personal benefits they had never seen. The seven teens decide to secretly revive the 'Dead Poets Society,' a club that was erected to study and preserve the teachings and the beauty of poetry written by poets who have passed away. Keating was a member of the society when he attended Welton Academy and loved it, so naturally the boys want to have a similar experience.When the boys create the society, the first thing I sort of cringed at was the way they acted. It was as if they felt they were making a difference to society in general rather than simply learning something in an institution that predicates itself off of learning in the first place. Then it hit me; that's exactly what they were doing. The beauty of Dead Poets Society is that these teenagers are actually learning and feeling like they're becoming better (or at least different) people because of it. Weir and writer Tom Schulman are specifically trying to detail the dramatic shift in thinking the boys are experiencing in school. It succeeds because we can see the difference in their actions and their way of looking at the world because of it. Consider when Todd runs outside after hearing tragic news to only stop and look at the snow falling and blanketing the grass below. 'It's beautiful,' he says, before falling to his knees. Without Mr. Keating, he would've fallen to his knees.However, I will say that by the end of the film, Keating is left too much of an enigma. He is all too clearly a metaphor of a captain, leading his shipmates (the teenagers) to a destination much different than what they intended. That destination is unclear, but the journey provides for a change of scenery for the boys. Robin Williams gives a great performance, but he's playing a character that is all too clearly supposed to be analyzed rather than resonated with.All the teenagers do exceptional acting, especially Robert Sean Leonard as Neil, whose father (Kurtwood Smith) pressures him to no end to become a doctor or anything but what his passion wants, which is to be an actor. This is where I come back and explore another theme of the film, this time one that's rarely touched on. With all the coming-of-age films, it's a bit difficult to find one that shows parents dictating their children's live in a way that is memorable. Smith's performance as a father who appears so stubborn and dictative over his son's actions he comes off as ignorant to his son's cries for a different life is a scarcely-mentioned one, but the themes at hand here kind of overshadow it. The film handles the idea in a way that's difficult to explain, but easy, if not relatable, to view.But in addition, the mention of the film's use of theatrics and mawkishness come to mind once more. There is a tragedy that takes place in the film (attentive viewers, like myself, will see it coming long before it happens). When it does occur, the way the film handles it feels more like a way to attract tears than actual reality. The slow-motion effect doesn't help the film's case either. Everything after that scene, including the obligatory scene of appreciating the teacher's accomplishments that's tacked on at the end of the film, feels rushed.As one can infer, I'm hot and cold with this film. As an aspiring English major and a person who loves to read and appreciate poetry, I appreciate the fact that this film - if shown to adolescents - can show them that reading and analyzing can be enjoyable if taken with seriousness and a willingness to learn. However, there are times when the film strays off its unconventional themes and focus in favor of a more sentimental portrayal of impact and motivation on students.There's a truly amazing film in here, but due to the film's attitude of trying to embellish its emotional impact and leave our faces tear-stained, it's kind of deluded.",8,0,1,16 December 2013
Just Go with It," Full of Devlin comedy
","Just Go With It is at times dreadfully boring and extremely unfunny as it approaches the two hour mark and we are still waiting to laugh. It is one of the most selfish, laugh-free comedies I've ever seen barely saved by the beautiful scenery and likable Aniston. But even with those two minor improvements that we see what Just Go With It is really about - cheap laughs and cliché Sandler schtick.This was based on a Broadway play that later became a 1969, Walter Mathau film called Cactus Flower, that later became a French play, that finally became this. I say this story has its tank run dry as this story is not only not funny but kind of sad. Sandler plays Danny, who called off his wedding day when he heard his wife talking behind his back with her friends.Going to a bar with his ring on, he attracts a women and tells her a sympathy story leading to them sleeping together. Twenty five years later, he still wears the wedding ring and continues to sleep with loser bimbos to sort of never run the risk of falling in love. This works, until he meets Palmer (Decker), a beautiful women who finds the ring in his jean pocket.Danny panics and tells lie after lie that he is married, but getting a divorce to his office worker Katherine (Aniston). Lie after lie leads him to fake-fathering Katherine's two bratty kids who he plans to fake kill off later. The 'family,' Palmer, and Danny's friend all plan to go to Hawaii where more nonsense takes place.Some scenes, notably the hula contest and the scenes at the kid's playground, go on for way too long and it's nothing but a poorly written joke made to be completely not funny. I guess we're supposed to root for Danny in hopes he'd get the girl, but I find no likable qualities about a womanizing loser who is not the least bit clever or funny. This is yet another movie that could be over if Danny had told Palmer he does sleeps with several women saying he is married and has a bad wife. He could then go on to tell her how she's different in a real passionate way and take her out to a bar and they can get to know each other. That might've made a way better film.Nicole Kidman shows up in quite possibly the worst role she's ever been offered as Devlin, Katherine's old rival. What a coincidence she is staying at the same hotel in Hawaii as Katherine at the most convenient time when she is all tied up with her 'family' issues.Also in the movie is Nick Swardson who is definitely the worst person in this movie playing a close friend of Danny's sporting one of the worst German accents I've ever heard. Every scene is he is in is too long and not at all funny in any way. Not even good for a bad laugh.It comes as no surprise Just Go With It is directed by Dennis Dugan who worked on other bad comedies like The Benchwarmers, Big Daddy, and Grown Ups. It seems ever since I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry, a decent comedy, Dugan has had nothing but fun placing Sandler in every character possible. Now he is working on Jack & Jill, another comedy that pairs Sandler and Al Pacino together. God help us.Starring: Adam Sandler, Jennifer Aniston, Nick Swardson, Dan Patrick, Brooklyn Decker, Nicole Kidman, and Dave Matthews. Directed by: Dennis Dugan.",3,15,26,20 June 2011
Brokeback Mountain," Some will emerge optimistically, while others will emerge not fulfilled
","Brokeback Mountain is a beautiful film in terms of plot, scenery, acting, and execution. Its landscapes alone could give tips to any location photographer old and young, and its screenplay is a work of genuine subtlety conveyed professionally throughout the course of the film. An early scene where both men meet outside, awaiting their job assignments from their boss, you can see the way they look at each other shows they are somewhat interested. The scene is beautifully crafted, and most importantly, doesn't hammer in any overbearing 'love at first sight clichés' and doesn't make this romance out to be pretentious just because it's different.The men are Jack Twist (Gyllenhaal) and Ennis Del Mar (Ledger), two sheepherders who get assigned to work on Brokeback Mountain in Wyoming during the summer of '63. Jack and Ennis connect closely on the mountain, and wind up becoming even closer during a night where numerous sips of the bottle are taken. Trying to convince themselves it was a one time thing, feelings become overwhelming, and an emotional and sexual relationship quickly brews.But after the summer is over, the inevitable breeds contempt. Ennis returns home to his fiancée, Alma Beers (Williams), whom he has three children with, and Jack somewhat impulsively marries the beautiful rodeo rider, Lureen Newsome (Hathaway). This seems to be the lives many gay men endure. Fighting urges, resisting temptations, and gridlocking inhibitions and suppression, to live 'the normal' lifestyle with a wife and kids eventually dying partially satisfied yet unfulfilled. Ennis was taught by his father that being gay was an absolute sin, and since then, he was forced to suppress his feelings and forcefully try to 'straighten' himself out. It didn't happen.While memories of the summer of '63 loom over their heads, Jack and Ennis try and live comfortable lives, yet still make an effort to see each other when they can. Some confrontations go rather smoothly, others have a contentious presence to them, and some result in punches. The men are saddened at their forced suppression for their feelings, but fear the pending backlash if they were to live the life they want would be crucial and possibly fatal to their happiness. It's a bitter world where intolerance is easier to abide by than acceptance, where turning a blind eye is easier than searching for the truth, and hate is easier to follow than the path of love. This is what makes Brokeback Mountain so hard to watch at times; when those points begin to circle through the viewer's head.There's just one marginally sizable complaint I have with the film and it's the last twenty-five minutes. Inevitably, we know one will die, and in this case, it is Jack. His death is left purposely ambiguous, with Lureen saying he died from a tire that burst when trying to inflate it, and Ennis contemplates that he died from a hate crime. What a petty cliché, used in a film that certainly didn't need it. Romantic comedies that end with a straight romance always end the same way, with the guy and girl falling in love, but the one time we get a mainstream gay romance it ends with the death of one of the men and the feeling of emptiness sadly comes into the picture again. The message Brokeback sends out to people, hetero or homosexual, is basically 'gays can live the life they want, but it will end with woeful calamity.' Aside from the unfortunate path taken in the third act, this is a wonderful film. The photography and scenery of the rural Wyoming is masterfully shot, and probably some of the best cinematography from the last decade along with Road to Perdition. Not to mention, Ang Lee's stellar direction, again focusing on a wide range of shots, ranging from close-ups, to wide angle, to miraculous shots where the scenery becomes the main cast-member. Before taking on the director role for Brokeback, Lee directed Hulk, another film about an outsider looking in, which occupied an impeccable love for storytelling and depth, as well as heartbreaking and distant father/son relationships. The same goes for this film.I have a feeling that many audiences will go in hazy about the idea of a film about two gay men falling in love, but emerge from it sympathetic and optimistic about the homosexual community. While this isn't a perfect excursion, it's a highly memorable one, complete with ecstatic performances, luscious landscapes, and some delightfully fitting music to a story so poignant yet satisfying.Starring: Jake Gyllenhaal, Heath Ledger, Michelle Williams, and Anne Hathaway.

Home Alone," Some of the best childhood escapism ever put on film
","Home Alone is often compared to something it was never trying to be; plausible. It is a very fictitious film. One only a child might like. Parents will be divided. I can see some laughing, some cringing, and some sleeping. Young children will appreciate it, the current generation of teens might, and those who grew up with it will continue to watch the constant reruns on Television during the Christmas season.While the concept is implausible, the story is simple. Eight year old Kevin McCallister (Culkin) is accidentally left home alone by his forgetful family during a hectic morning rush to get to the airport for their family vacation. Kevin enjoys having the house to himself after wishing he didn't have a family the night before. But then, he becomes the target for two bumbling criminals named Harry and Marv (Pesci and Stern).Kevin creates many booby traps throughout the whole film. He uses them to his advantage so that the criminals can suffer many, many obnoxious blows to the head. Some funny, some not. It's all up to the film's way of timing it. Some traps can be hysterical, while others become very redundant. I can see how plausibility clouds the viewers' enjoyment to the film because you know that no eight year old would be able to concoct if he was fed cough syrup to help him stay asleep during a cold.But Home Alone ultimately accomplishes one crucial element; giving cute and inspired scenes for the purpose of childhood escapism. Children love watching unrealistic things happening on screen. Especially when the protagonist is right around their age. This film is ideal for children of that age because it will tickle them that someone of their age can create such things like that. Then they will try and find one of their friends at school who can do the same sort of thing.It's delightful and cheery, but very dopey and slapsticky. I mentioned the jokes don't always work, but many times they certainly do. After all, there is something that tickles my happy place when I see someone of such a young age outsmart two criminals. There's something lying in that premise that brings out the child in me.This was of course produced by the teenager-whisper John Hughes himself. It seems after a very successful run of high school films he wanted to calm his brain and do one about a child. It's strange to watch a John Hughes film that occupies little to no coming of age elements, but still, Kevin is a bit too young to be truly finding his self-worth and purpose on Earth.Macaulay Culkin is a delightful young actor, but sadly hasn't gone on to do very many things in recent years unlike his two brothers Kieran and Rory, respectively. Culkin did however play a paraplegic in the Christian-satire Saved! which I instantly fell in love with. Here he's a lot younger and livelier, and you just knew he would go on to play the cute, 'innocent' young boy in many other films while he was still a cute, 'innocent' young boy.Home Alone will also resurrect memories from your youth when you were left home alone for the very first time. The house seems so much bigger, emptier, and more silent than it ever has before. It's the strangest feeling that only weakens over time.Like I said before, a person's generation and age will factor in greatly when judging if they like or dislike this film. Personally, it still holds up today. It's fresh, entertaining, and satisfying, but can be redundant at points. Home Alone was a cute concept, but the sequel treatment was anything but left alone. Still, as long as there are still devoted supporters of this cherished film, I can say that the repeated airings on popular cable networks will not cease in the immediate future.Starring: Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci, and Daniel Stern.

Spotlight," A film so low-key and subtle you might mistake it for another adult drama in a saturated market
","'Spotlight''s pervasive casual attitude and laidback presentation as a film almost effectively undermine two things - how uniformly solid the acting is all around and how terrific of a film this really is. Reminiscent of Danny Boyle's 'Steve Jobs' last month in that it's a film that focuses on a lot of decidedly smaller, human moments that make up the entirety of the project, 'Spotlight' is a film that, unless you really look at it from various angles in its acting, storytelling, and pacing, you might mistake it for just another drama in a sea of adult entertainment this holiday season.The film revolves around The Boston Globe newsroom, specifically the Spotlight team, a division of about four field reporters who choose a topic apart from a great deal of media attention and devote months of investigation in order to give an elaborate, in-depth story on it in a future paper. The team is comprised of Walter 'Robby' Robinson (Michael Keaton), the veteran of the group who often acts as the leader, Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), a young, persistent journalist, Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), the woman responsible for undergoing difficult interviews that largely involve cold-approaching people, and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James), a family man who does a great deal of the team's research.In response to the paper's slumping readership despite being acquired by The New York Times years earlier, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) is brought into make adjustments where needed. Upon arrival, he more or less directs the Spotlight team to focus their attention on the Boston archdiocese and the prevalent cases of molestation and sexual abuse involving priests and minors in the Catholic Church. Once the group begins to dive in and investigate, they realize the scope of the case is much greater and more impacting than any of them imagined, and also learn that The Globe had a great deal of this information at their disposal years ago but sat on their hands instead of covering it.'Spotlight' takes a fascinatingly relaxed approach to this story, focusing on the breezy conversations and etiquette in a newsroom. Boston Globe's Spotlight team proves that, while investigative journalism has the ability to shake an entire nation, it's also criminally underfunded, much like watchdog journalism, which both find themselves largely segregated on the secondary sources of the internet in the present day. This sort of very nonchalant vibe does wonders when 'Spotlight' inevitably turns emotional, specifically when Michael and Sacha find themselves interviewing former victims of priests who have lived with the hell and uncertainty of their troubled childhood experiences.Much like a well-written news article, 'Spotlight' has the ability to infuriate in a manner that doesn't derail the project into manipulative territory. A large portion of the film is devoted to the meticulous practices of contemporary journalistic investigations in a way that really shows the talky, but elaborate process of interviewing. Americans, many of whom can't go a day without picking up a newspaper or reading a webpage or an email telling them the day's events, often do not consider what goes into the stories we read and take for granted each day; 'Spotlight' not only showcases the impact the stories can have, but also shows the most important parts of the newsgathering process in a way that is gripping without being bombastic.The lax attitude and approach writers Thomas McCarthy (also director) and Josh Singer almost disguises the attention to acting and character development on display here. Michael Keaton hits another home-run with his human portrayal of Walter Robinson, largely because his character, unlike Riggen Thomson in 'Birdman' last year, is never too dramatic or out of his own element. Meanwhile, Mark Ruffalo does a great job at being both a younger journalist and a likable one; not a smug nor self-serious jokester who ostensibly stumbled into the job as generic Hollywood roles would traditionally have it, Rachel McAdams delivers some of the strongest and most compelling work of her career thanks to her realistic portrayal of her character, and the same goes for Brian d'Arcy James.'Spotlight' doesn't look to shortchange any of these characters nor play them to predictable types. Walter isn't the kind of veteran journalist who screams and shouts whenever he doesn't get his way, Michael isn't the lackadaisical bloke who doesn't take his work seriously, Sacha isn't the ditsy journalist who needs to constant be reminded her job comes with a big responsibility, Matt isn't a stiff-as-a-board moralist, and Marty isn't the evil corporate downsizer looking to corrupt the integrity of The Globe (not openly, at least). None of these characters pander to conventional archetypes and perhaps that, much like the strength of the film's approach, will be lost upon audiences who do not actively notice it at first.Finally, McCarthy directs 'Spotlight' with humble interjections of style; consider a key telephone interview being the subject of a medium-length take that has all the members of the Spotlight team hovered around a phone. McCarthy's camera focuses on the telephone before slowly pulling back the camera to reveal the entire team, and then pulling even further back down a hallway to minimize the size of the team. This interview really establishes the scope of the Catholic Church's unforgivable crimes, and this effort to showcase how small this team is in the face of this huge issue is a nice way to capture the film with an unwritten thesis, and investigative journalism in a nutshell. Everything in 'Spotlight' that's so brilliantly done is so quietly captured that it's almost as if it's designed for you to miss. With that, I'd advise you to watch it like you would read a gripping news article: with intent to focus and read between the lines, even the headlines.",9,4,9,23 November 2015
500 Days of Summer," Summer Lovin'
","A beautiful look on true relationships makes up (500) Days of Summer. Nothing more than a sweet, touching, and believable antics do Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel get into. I should state, like in the movie, that this is a story of 'Boy meets girl'. It is in no way 'A love story'. This is a movie, that surpasses the title of 'Just another quirky Romantic Comedy'.The movie is about sweet and simple Tom Hansen(Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who looks and frets over the 'girl of his dreams'. He is an architect, though works as a Greeting Card Maker of all jobs. One day, his boss gets a new assistant, Summer Finn (Zooey Deschannel). Tom is in the love at first site stage. He denies it, but the fact of the matter is it's undeniably true.After learning Summer like the same music as he does, Tom tries to hint Summer he likes her and wants to go out. After numerous attempts fail, he sucks it up and spends time with her. The duo play the 'mommy and daddy' like relationship. Going to Ikea to pretend the appliances are actually theirs and frequently going out to dinner.The storyline and chronological order of the movie overall impresses me to great extent. It's played out in days, though skips frequently so the audience doesn't have to watch everyday, throughout.When something goes well in Tom's life, it flashes to a point in the movie were something doesn't go right. Tom than becomes almost obsessed with Summer and believes she is the girl for him and nothing can stop him from 'winning her over'.After various uses of quotations around different love quotes I should state my reasoning that this movie takes a lot of aspect of all the love terms out there and uses a bit of each one. The director of this movie, Marc Webb, in which this is his debut film, does a wonderful job with this movie.(500) Days of Summer is not by any means a love story. It's a true visionary piece composed of stunning lines and a beautiful relationship between Joesph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschannel who very much could be a couple more than just on screen.Starring: Joesph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschannel. Directed by Marc Webb.",10,0,0,4 July 2010
Juno," Why can't all teen films be as nice as this?
","There is something quirky and special about Juno that I can not put in words that make sense. It's something totally unexpected and a very surprisingly well done teenage film in 2007. It's so rare we see a film done like this recently. But it gives hope that charming and one of a kind teenage films are not dead. They maybe just on hiatus.Ellen Page plays Juno, an independent girl who tries to take action when she realizes that she is pregnant with her ex-boyfriend's child (Cera). She considers abortion (in a non-biased pro life, pro choice decision) and she becomes more and more frustrated as her options get smaller and as her stomach gets larger.I love movies that dare to be different. They don't always work, but they at least get a few points for coloring outside of the lines. Juno is a film that colors outside of the lines and it makes a picture. A beautiful picture of a girl who just wants to live and do what she believes is right.The quirky element of the film is taken a tiny bit too far when Juno feels the need to tell the woman at the Abortion clinic that she 'is talking on her hamburger phone.' Yes, our protagonist communicates on a novelty hamburger shaped phone. I searched through reviews on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes before coming across a review on Netflix with someone stating the same problem they had with the film.The joke is the film acts natural by including some trinket like a hamburger phone and not noticing it. The fact that Juno had to say she was 'talking on her hamburger phone' ruins the joke because now the film is trying too hard to get its audience to know the film is different. It didn't need to announce it. We knew it from the start. The film doesn't need to turn self aware all of a sudden.That minor flaw isn't enough to deduct the film any stars. Juno is perfect. It's a teen film was almost too good. Michael Cera does great at playing his trademark role as a geeky, pushed around dweeb with a big heart. Him and Ellen Page have amazing chemistry that just clicks from the start.Juno could be called a sleeper hit at the Oscars for only winning Best Original Screenplay by Diablo Cody, respectively. The film was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Director (Reitman), and Best Actress (Page). It found itself sort of shoved to the side while films like No Country For Old Men got the fame. Sort of sad, but hopefully it will bounce back.Of course the film came with quotable catchphrases like 'Woah, dream big!' 'Honest to blog?' and 'Shut your gob!' All uttered by our female lead, Ellen Page. The film introduces us to its character's vocabulary besides telling us a lot about her colorful personality.Juno is probably the best teen film of the 2000's decade followed by Mean Girls. It is so quirky and lovable it is welcomed as more than a daring experiment, but an unforgettable and touching film in it's category.Starring: Ellen Page, Michael Cera, Jason Bateman, J.K. Simmons, Jennifer Garner, Allison Janney, and Olivia Thirlby. Directed by: Jason Reitman.",10,2,6,2 May 2011
Concussion," A film that hits hard and bears lasting effects on the viewer
","It seems there is nothing more American than a corporation going against damn-near indisputable evidence of harm being done or being perpetuated by their silence. In the 1990's, it was tobacco tycoons like Philip Morris and R. J. Reynolds funneling countless money to lobbyists in effort to keep word from getting around that smoking cigarettes and cigars causes innumerable health problems to ones system, and in the modern day, it's the rampant denial of climate change by big oil companies like BP and the billionaire Koch brothers. Somewhere in between blowing the lid off of both the tobacco and the oil industry was a deeper, more human-centered issue that shocked a corporation that has gone on to own a day of the week.That issue is concussions and pervasive, crippling head trauma in the National Football League. In 2002, following the death of former Pittsburgh Steelers center Mike Webster, a Nigerian pathologist named Dr. Bennet Omalu discovered that repetitive head trauma, by way of thunderous and recurring blows to the head, winds up choking the brain, which sits inside the human skull in a bath of fluids disconnected from any part of the skull. Dr. Omalu's research discovered that Webster's bouts of dizziness, paranoia, and instability were results of taking thousands of blows to the head - the equivalent of more than 20,000 car accidents - while playing football. Omalu's research would seem outlandish if it didn't keep being proved, following the death of Steelers offensive tackle Justin Strzelczyk, who had suffered from chronic trauma encephalopathy (CTE), and the suicides of Philadelphia Eagles safety Andre Waters and Chicago Bears safety Dave Duerson, who wound up donating his brain to Omalu for research.Upon Omalu's findings being published and released to the public, he was met with widespread criticism for his lack of formal U.S. citizenship and his alleged efforts to take down or neuter one of America's most cherished sports. The NFL, including the newly appointed commissioner Roger Goodell, tried everything to silence Omalu, even going to great lengths by staging panels and press conferences that made the public look like the league was addressing the problem, when really, it was nothing more than a publicity stunt.Though it's difficult to go any Sunday without hearing something about concussions during a game, be it from a coach asserting that he's taking every step to prevent such matters, or a player experiencing concussion-like symptoms, Omalu's story is given the recognition it deserves in Peter Landesman's 'Concussion.' Landesman, who wrote and directed 'Parkland,' a film about the multitude of key people that witnessed the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on the frontlines, molds 'Concussion' into a tense, slowburn procedural with a strong central performance at its core.Omalu is played by Will Smith in what is a comeback role he was lucky to get. After the notorious financial and critical failure of 'After Earth,' Smith was sidelined as a movie star, barely earning a secondary mention in the forgotten 2014 'Winter's Tale.' This was a role he needed in order to propel him back to the frontlines as one of America's strongest and most consistently impressive actors, and needless to say, he nails it. His performance as Omalu is understated and thoughtful, as he plays the softspoken, Nigerian pathologist with strong charisma, effectively depicting an almost meditative admiration for America as the homeland of God's people where anything is possible. Even certain scenes in the trailer, such as the famous 'tell the truth' scene that came off as corny as a stand-alone moment, achieve fireworks here as Smith is back in his element.Right by Smith's side is Alec Baldwin, playing Dr. Julian Bales, an NFL-appointed doctor for teammates, who abandons his cozy, high-paying job for the greater good of mentally unstable football players that run the risk of dying under the same circumstances as Webster. Baldwin does a nice job of holding his own weight as a character in this film and not intruding on Smith's almost tour-de-force performance as Omalu.As an audience member, I can see from the montages of football games in the film and hear from the sound two helmets or skulls make on impact that that kind of repetitive trauma isn't good for the head, just from a logic standpoint. I can see from Webster's worn-face and addiction to painkillers as he lives in the back of his beater pickup truck that the effects of that kind of trauma are lasting. I don't need to be told in multiple different terms I cannot remember, let alone pronounce, how and what membranes are affected in the brain by that kind of brutality. Landesman thankfully recognizes this and makes 'Concussion' about those who suffer from this kind of illness and Omalu's struggle to be honest and compassionate as he goes up against a money-hungry, corporate entity interested in protecting their own brand rather than the lives of those that make said brand what it is.'Concussion' is a film that succeeds because it's a human-centered story, with two strong performances that work off of one another, yet stand alone in their own elements, in addition to having some seriously crisp, almost dreamlike cinematography (done by Salvatore Totino, who also did the cinematography for 'Changing Lanes' and 'The Missing'). Some will complain it's not as critical of the NFL as it should be, and some will find the lack of explicit science deceptive in some way. For me, it's about all you can ask for a film that simply wants the truth and human-scale to prevail above all. It doesn't have the slickness nor the social relevance angle that this year's amazing 'Spotlight' had, but it also serves as competent dramatic entertainment in addition to being the nudge we all need before we fall asleep from our wakeup on this issue.",8,8,17,26 December 2015
X-Men," Holds up amazingly well in the face of innovation and standards that refuse to bottom out
","X-Men has been the sole Marvel franchise to exist during the campier and less serious times of the superhero genre and the more serious, ubiquitous times of the genre. In a way, it's difficult to believe the film is fourteen years old, but the franchise it spawned is still going strong to this date.For a fourteen-year-old film revolving around mutants, genetic modifications, and including seven superheros it needs to acquaint audiences with, X-Men is still much better than anyone probably would've initially imagined. In a shockingly short one-hundred and four minutes, the film manages to give all seven of its heroes some time to shine, while offering us some seriously contemplative political drama on the ethical ideas of allowing mutants and genetically-modified humans to coexist with traditional humans. The result is a pretty intriguing endeavor.Set in the not-so distant future, we see that the idea of mutants - or those who possess special powers as a result of DNA modifications/mutations - being able to declare themselves through the means of public registration has surpassed issues of gay marriage, abortion, and immigration in the United States Congress. Senator Robert Kelly (Bruce Davison) is the leader of this movement, using Congressional hearings as his opportunity to stand on his soapbox and sermonize about how mutant registration needs to exist for the safety and well-being of America.Meanwhile, Professor X (Patrick Stewart) is busy constructing his merry-band of X-Men, or, mutants, in order for them to bring about their own line of vigilante justice. We have Cyclops (James Marsden), with his laser-eyes, Dr. Jean Greay (Famke Janssen), whose telekinetic powers prove limitless in size and scope, and Storm (Halle Berry), who lives up to her name with powers that can manipulate meteorology and weather.Professor X runs a school called the 'School for Gifted Children,' where those with unforeseen powers can go and still have their own free will and dignity intact. Two new students with incredible potential arrive at X's school one day; Rogue (Anna Paquin), a shy recluse who discovers that she cannot touch another being without the life of them being literally sucked out of them and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), a muscular individual with retractable claws that sprout from his knuckles. Both contemplate whether or not they should join X's band of X-Men and make an attempt at defeating Magento (Ian McKellen) and his band of loyal comrades.For a film that works to assemble a barrage of different heroes and utilize them in creative ways, it's sort of admirable how X-Men doesn't get lost in the shuffle. While not each hero bears a great deal of personality, each is humanized to the point where you feel you could at least recognize and find yourself acquainted with them on a basic level. Then there's the fact that despite bearing a lot of heroes in the film adaptation, X-Men had enough heroes for multiple different franchises when it was confined to the captivating, colorful pages of a comic book.For what it has, and for what writer David Hayter and director Bryan Singer choose to do with it, X-Men manages to be a surprisingly solid, especially given its cluttered array of characters. The film avoids the pitfalls of a dry origin story by not only giving each character time to showcase their powers and utilize them accordingly, but usher in biting political debate about the ethics and value of having a world with known mutants. Toss in some uniformly strong acting, especially by the likes of Jackman, Paquin, McKellen, and Stewart, and you have a strongly-constructed package deal.X-Men really marks the drastic change in tone superhero films of the 2000's ushered in. The genre that was once looked at as a piece of escapist camp ultimately became one to show people that things aren't forever and that genres can undergo a drastic change overtime. What became of the superhero genre is something to praise and commend, albeit critique in aspects, and this particular pictures serves as a winning time capsule to that enormous revitalization.Starring: Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Anna Paquin, Bruce Davison, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, and Ray Park.

Spider-Man 3," So many subplots, so little time
","Never in any superhero film I have seen has a heroine or a love interest gotten in as much trouble as Mary Jane Watson, still played by Kirsten Dunst. If she's not in trouble, she's a whiny, impenetrably jealous woman with mood-swings on the dime. She becomes bent out of shape from one petty kiss Spider-Man shares with Gwen Stacy, who is in Peter Parker's chemistry class, after he is awarded the key to the city early on in the film. And if she's not whiny and jealous, she's dangling helplessly, 'x' amount of feet from land in a vehicle secured by webs strung in all different directions. Oh, now where's that dirty, rotten, cheatin' Spider-Man when you need him? Spider-Man 3 is a rather depressing and unsatisfying conclusion to a franchise that hit the ground running with its divine human scope, wonderfully colorful and cinematic special effects, and worthy performances from its entire cast. The original Spider-Man film was impeccably rewarding and undeniably entertaining, but more importantly, should be known as more than popcorn entertainment, but intelligent entertainment, with an appreciation and fondness for the human behind the mask and bearing it. Its sequel was even more impressive, depicting the agonies and the weight of being a College kid, a freelance photographer, a moderately-devoted romantic, a best friend, and a serene crime-fighting superhero all in a day's work. The stress on Peter Parker's shoulders was unbearable and the film, brilliantly written and directed, conveyed the angst and pressure perfectly.With the first film being more about familiarity with powers and the second film being more about the struggle of the job, I contemplated what the third film would focus on. I imagine the writers, Alvin Sargent and the brothers Raimi, Sam and Ivan, did as well. Apparently, none of them were easy to agree, because Spider-Man 3 feels like someone had a plethora of ideas and shot in the dark with most of them. The film tirelessly juggles five stern subplots, while seemingly trying to incorporate more, to the point of cinematic confusion.We are greeted again with Peter Parker, again, played by the effortlessly charismatic Tobey Maguire, who plans to romantically propose to the long-suffering Mary Jane Watson, who has just made her musical debut on Broadway. During their date, we see a strange, extraterrestrial symbiote crash-land on Earth and attach itself to the back of Parker's moped. Meanwhile, criminal Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), who will later become 'The Sandman,' has just escaped from prison, and is ostracized by his wife and daughter.Before we go too much into that, the arrogant Harry Osborn (James Franco) returns and is infuriated at Peter Parker, who he believes is responsible for the death of his father in the first film. He carries on his dead father's orders to 'avenge' him, and after a brazen fight in the New York City sky, Harry hits the ground hard and experiences short-term memory loss, making him forget his grudge towards Peter. He will inevitably regain his memory and transform into the 'New Goblin.' Before we go too much into that, Peter is also facing some harsh competition at 'The Daily Bugle' newspaper (which is still run by the strict J. Jonah Jameson, continued to be played fantastically by J.K. Simmons) when Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), another freelance photographer, is hired by Jameson to try and catch Spider-Man doing something that would turn the town against him. Grace, who I continue to dub an underrated talent in film, plays Brock with admirable conniving instincts, and when he later must force himself into the role of 'Venom,' he does a solid job for a villain so underwritten. Venom was a last minute addition to Spider-Man 3 and it greatly shows, since his story is given very minimal time to develop. The character of Brock, too, is only modestly fleshed-out, and his screen appearance is short when compared to the likes of Sandman and Osborn's 'Goblin.' Before we go too much into that, we can't forget Mary Jane is struggling to get work in the enormous state of New York. She continues to plod along in the vaguest of limelights, desperately trying to achieve her dream as a consistent Broadway performer, but reality gives her hard slaps to the face and the film is sure to try and illustrate those.And let's really not forget that symbiote that attached to Peter's moped and will eventually alter his personality by clinging to his body, giving his red spidey suit an unwanted black makeover. This will too turn the geeky, socially-awkward Parker into an over-confident, boastful cad with dark eyeshadow and a Gothic-like persona.There's Spider-Man 3 in the biggest nutshell I can find. I almost forgot to mention the redundancy in its sentimentality as well. This is without a doubt the sappiest Spider-Man extravaganza we've gotten and are likely to ever get from a film based on this character. Everybody offers some sort of advice to Peter, several characters shed tears, even the villains (which tremendously obscures how we're supposed to look at The Sandman in particular, with sympathy? Forgiveness? Or just nihilistic impulse because he's a villain?). Despite some extremely well-done effects work, easily making this the most visually impressive and eye-catching film in the series, the overwrought nature, the depressingly underdeveloped subplots, the shorthanded villain backstories, the repetitive sentimentality that creates an atmosphere more self-depreciating and mawkish than need be, and the needlessly emphasized issues that should've been left as subtle as possible, Spider-Man 3 is a big budget mess and a big budget disappointment.Starring: Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Thomas Haden Church, Topher Grace, Bryce Dallas Howard, James Cromwell, Rosemary Harris, and J. K. Simmons. Directed by: Sam Raimi.",5,1,3,19 July 2012
Match Point," Allen doesn't stop at simplicity
","Woody Allen's Match Point opens by telling us exactly where it derives its title from. It compares life to that moment in a game of tennis, when a ball is swung and hits the top of the net and for a split second has the option of falling back on your side of the court, penalizing you or, with a little luck, falling on your opponent's side, penalizing them. In a sense, this is a film that questions the mysteries that inhabit life, actually offering up some very interesting existential questions about life and its numerous quirks.I guess it's too considered a 'match point' when you've caught yourself in the middle of a love triangle and are unsure of whether to stay with the one you're officially with or take a risk and form a full, open relationship with the one you've kept 'waiting' on the side. The character stuck in this depressing position is Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), a retired professional tennis player attempting to climb the social ladder in London, as he trains Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode). The two share their love for opera, and along the way, Chris meets Chloe (Emily Mortimer), Tom's sister, and quickly jumps into a relationship with her. That is, until he meets Tom's confident, incredibly sensuous fiancée named Nola Rice (Scarlet Johansson). The woman is bold, beautiful, and gorgeous and knows of this, and becomes smitten with the idea of becoming involved in an affair with Chris, while Chloe is left in the dark. There are a number of twists and unforeseen directions in the film, so spoiling them would be an act of sin.Allen completely disregards everything he's led us to believe he has been about since his career beginnings in the 1960's. His male archetype is not a neurotic, inept, quirky writer, but a fully brazen and somewhat arrogant womanizer played expertly by Meyers, who embodies this role with true power and intensity. The characters around him that could've been gravely underwritten (for example, Mortimer's Chloe) are developed through monologues in luxurious restaurants, sipping the fanciest wine, talking openly amongst friends and acquaintances. It's scenes like this that Allen nails with a complete and total brash sense of direction and confidence. He portrays these luxurious get-togethers as comfortable, inviting experiences that places the viewer at their table or like a voyeur at a nearby table, listening in on a conversation you're afraid for just because you don't want it to go the way you believe it will.Aside from Meyers, the wealth of supporting talent that surrounds him is commendable and fascinating. He is greatly assisted by Johansson's deeply passionate, sensuous Nola, and we can see him being persuaded by her just by her simple gaze and her incredible attractive lips.Match Point could've evolved into a simple love triangle involving a prestigious tennis player desperately struggling to maintain two different girls while he resides in London's upper-class. But two tactics that Allen inserts here comfortably are exploring how someone can climb the social ladder of London, and, inviting in the idea of how luck plays a role in all our lives. He illustrates how sometimes the most despicable, unruly humans get the undeserved good luck, while the good people of the world get shafted with the bad luck.In multiple ways, this reminded me of Spike Lee's sincere and delightfully efficient directorial debut She's Gotta Have It, which also centered around a love triangle, but instead of exploring the idea of how luck plays into ones life, it examined each character and how they reacted to being part of this triangle. Lee channeled Allen in some respects, with the black and white atmosphere and the dramatic tonality of the screenplay, and both in return made a sufficient picture.Some consider Allen to come gift wrapped in his own pretentiousness and accuse him for making 'odd' pictures that few can connect with. I consider him valuable and a necessity to film; we need people like Allen to show a barrage of different people, with extremely different personalities, that somehow come all together and connect with their traits to make the complex, admirably complete figure that is Woody Allen.Starring: Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Scarlett Johansson, Emily Mortimer, Matthew Goode, Brian Cox, and Penelope Wilton.

Midnight in Paris," A film that spoke to moi
","Words fail me to describe what a joyous, extravagant, and unbelievably beautiful experience Midnight in Paris gave me. Not only did it immerse me inside its world of fantasy, whimsicality, and gentleness, but it gave me a strong superficial aspect I believe only myself, aspiring journalists, and veteran journalists will be able to extract from it. It's a close to home work of ravishing art.Owen Wilson is the Woody Allen character here. In almost every Woody Allen film, the main male character connects in some way with Allen himself. This time we supposedly see the romantic version of Woody who is shy, naive, and unassuming in his destiny to 'make things click.' Wilson plays Gil, a self-proclaimed 'hack' Hollywood screenwriter who has been working on a novel his fiancée Inez (McAdams) has dubbed 'a romantic daydream.' They are visiting Paris with Inez's parents, and Gil is desperately seeking motivation to finish his novel at the same time bask in the glory of his favorite city in the world.One night, Gil takes a walk and as soon as the clock strikes midnight he becomes ultimately transported into his nostalgic fantasy, 1920's Paris. The transportation isn't the cartoony skit we would've thought. It happens instantaneously, without any clear change except for the setting and the characters. He meets many of his idols including F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway.After having one night of incredible, indescribable circumstances, Gil takes another midnight walk the next day to be transported back to the 20's. Over time, he falls in love with the lovely Adrianna (Cotillard), who is dating Pablo Picasso. Adrianna is everything Inez isn't. Tolerable, easygoing, and supportive of his work. Inez seems to preoccupied after running into an old College flame shortly in their trip.Being an aspiring journalist, Midnight in Paris spoke to me using words that would be void of meaning if came from an actual person. Here's a man that escapes reality by visiting a time period he was never able to experience, talking to his idols he never got to know personally. I would love to go to the eighties and nineties and see my personal idols like Corey Feldman, Corey Haim, Gene Siskel, Kevin Smith, and John Waters in action during their heyday.But I digress. Inez's College flame pokes fun at Gil's unconditional love for nostalgia calling it 'denial.' Nostalgia isn't denial to me. It's more of a period appreciation complimented with a wish for it to return and a subtle pessimism because one may think great, landmark things won't be able to be achieved in the present. We all know that is untrue, but look at the eighties and all the political and pop culture accomplishments and tell me they're inferior to those of today. I suppose if we're talking the technological field they are, but it was more simplistic and more basic. Everything is so difficult now almost everywhere you look.This brings me to my next point. The film works as a form of escapism for literary writers. Think of it this way; Gil is in love with the period of the twenties in Paris and the idols that came out of it. He probably dreamt up his own fantasies with Hemingway and others before meeting them in person. When he finds them in real life, it's his own way of writer escapism. Some writers take more unhealthy practices such as drinking and drug use, but Gil frolics with Ernest and F. Scott. Maybe Woody Allen does in his dreams as well. Who wouldn't want to hear their idols' thoughts on their work in present day? As for the film itself, the art direction and acting, especially from Wilson, is effervescent, welcomed, and extraordinary. The opening sequence, which clocks in at almost four and a half minutes, features beautiful music and a slideshow of footage from Paris. It doesn't feel like a postcard as much as it does a scenic foreshadowing to the events we are about to be blessed with. Owen Wilson has also proved that when given the proper script and character he can be a marvelous and compelling character actor.I fell in love with Midnight in Paris early on for its excellent commentary on modernism vs. nostalgia factors. I became even more sold when the film decided to become close to home for me when discussing writing styles and escapism. Woody Allen has proved himself worthy of the title 'cinema genius' with this after a string of films critics and audiences found mediocre to fair. Here, it is the direct opposite. Critics were overjoyed and most audiences were astounded. Some people need to just step out in the rain once in a while. Midnight in Paris is the film that makes you.Starring: Owen Wilson, Rachel McAdams, Marion Cotillard, Kathy Bates, Adrien Brody, Carla Bruni, and Michael Sheen. Directed by: Woody Allen.",10,1,3,29 January 2012
Cloverfield," Post-9/11 reaction/response intimately examined through the lens of a raucous creature feature
","Matt Reeves' Cloverfield would be a significant film if it was only noteworthy for being the film that resurrected the found footage genre. With a minimalist marketing campaign of MySpace pages and trailers that emphasized the film's theatrical release date and nothing more, plus a whirlwind of positive buzz that hyped the film for much of the start of the 2008 year, Cloverfield was destined to be a history-making hit when it finally hit the scenes. However, as an encapsulation of post-9/11/'War on Terror' fear, the film is an unequivocal cultural staple of such simply by showing senseless disaster unfold and showcasing lives that we, the audience, otherwise wouldn't care about had they not been the focal point of this particular film. Few other films about this little find themselves saying so much.The film opens with a disclaimer by the United States Department of Defense that the film contained on the camcorder herein was seized as a piece of evidence that was found at a location by the name of 'Cloverfield,' 'formerly known as Central Park.' The tape largely includes footage from a going-away party for Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David), who will be traveling to Japan to become the vice president for a new company, only on occasion cutting away to a video shot after both Rob and his friend Beth (Odette Yustman) have sex, indicating the film being taped over. During his going-away party, thrown by his brother Jason (Mike Vogel) and filmed by his buddy Hudson Platt (T.J. Miller), who is traversing the entire loft to get video testimonies to congratulate his pal, not only does Rob's secret of sleeping with Beth come out, but so does a gigantic monster that begins destroying New York City in every conceivable way.At first, a thunderous shakeup and a brief power outage suggest an abruptly violent earthquake, but when buildings begin to explode and skyscrapers start crumbling, we can see that a bigger, more unexplainable force is behind these bouts of chaos. Through short glimpses captured by Hudson's camera, we can see that a strange, gray beast of about thirty stories resembling the most deformed monster that Godzilla would fight, is practically walking all over New York City, to the point where it is killing innocent lives and making everything a horrifying mess for everyone within the vicinity. The plan for the group of friends, which also includes Lily (Jessica Lucas), Jason's girlfriend, is to evacuate New York as quickly as possible, but that changes when Rob's call to Beth reveals nothing more than a distressed, blood-curdling scream that suggests she is pinned underneath the rubble of a building. The gang winds up deviating the course instructed by the U.S. Army in order to try and rescue Beth and dodge the towering monster.Cloverfield takes a Jaws-like approach to profiling the monster in the picture (or 'monsters,' as I'd like to keep open as a possibility for myself) in that it shows the creature largely in small, blink-and-you-miss-it glimpses. This has become common practice for found footage films, but Cloverfield employs the tactic with a bit of grace and buildup. Rather than acting like a metaphorical 'dollar on a live fishing reel,' director Matt Reeves makes sure to conjure up adequate suspense before he even thinks about showing us the monster at hand. After that, every small sip we get of the monster makes us fear that we'll eventually get a longer 'gulp' of the monster that we could choke on if we're not ready.Reeves keeps us on edge most of the film, and the chaos portrayed in this film is anything but controlled. The videography has the aesthetic grace of an unedited video in a warzone, the sound editing and mixing occasionally feels like it was sent through a blender, and the film, as a work of cinema and the respective found footage genre, is a sensory annihilation. As frustrating as this can be, this process, much like Reaves' directorial conservatism of showing us just small features of the monster and his destructive actions throughout the course of the seventy-three minute film, manages to reveal some truly beautiful and telling moments. Consider the scene when the group of partygoers, and the remainder of New York City for that matter, witness the monster throw the head of the Statue of Liberty over a mile in length before it crashes before them on a busy street. The gaggle of people stand in awe, some frozen in fear, some quick to snap a picture, and some sprinting to safety.The location of this film and the confusing circumstances are not coincidental; Cloverfield is, in some big ways, a reference to the mass hysteria and uncertainty that the 9/11 terrorist attacks brought on the United States. Actions that we were used to hearing about occurring overseas were suddenly in our metaphorical, and some literal, backyards, and the casualties, the incalculable destruction, and the disregard for life were something we could not ignore. Cloverfield attempts to replicate that feeling right down to its marketing campaign, which tells us little and leaves us with limited expectations. What we witness, however, is something that will leave a mark on many of us, or at least remind us of a similar time in America.Starring: Michael Stahl-David, T.J. Miller, Odette Yustman, Mike Vogel, and Jessica Lucas. Directed by: Matt Reeves.",9,0,1,10 March 2016
The Hateful Eight," A glorious bloodbath that celebrates the strengths of Tarantino and the incorruptible aesthetics of his films
","Quentin Tarantino's 'The Hateful Eight' has gone through hell and back again to get made, originally axed after Tarantino's distribution of the script to Bruce Dern, Tim Roth, and Michael Madsen led to one of the men leaking it onto the internet. After more-or-less throwing a tantrum over the entire event and shelving the project as a result, Tarantino, with massive fan support, per usual, decided to pursue turning the story into a film once again, and all seemed well until the film itself was leaked onto the internet just a few days before the release.The checkered history of the film's release before it was even able to be seen in a theater - where the film should ultimately be seen - is one of the strangest for a mainstream film in many years. In my opinion, however, it only adds to the craziness that is 'The Hateful Eight' as a whole. At just under three hours (or just over, if you catch the 70mm/Ultra Panavision 70 version in over one-hundred theaters in America), Tarantino's sprawling epic is a smartly written mystery, largely acting as a stageplay about eccentric souls stuck inside a haberdashery in the midst of a relentless and frigid Wyoming blizzard.The film opens with Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), a local bounty hunter, hitching a ride from a notorious bounty hunter named John Ruth (Kurt Russell), also known as 'The Hangman.' Ruth has a woman named Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) shackled to his arm, as he plans to turn her in for the $10,000 bounty as soon as they get to a place called 'Red Rock.' Warren tags along in order to get to a place called Minnie's Haberdashery to wait out the blizzard before finally traveling to Red Rock. Along the way, the three pick up a man named Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins), who claims to be the new sheriff in town, and upon arriving at the haberdashery, the four are acquainted with another shady bunch of men, including a quirky Englishman (Tim Roth), a Mexican man (Demián Bichir), a 'cow puncher' (Michael Madsen), and a largely quiet World War I veteran (Bruce Dern).'The Hateful Eight' is undoubtedly my favorite Tarantino film since 'Death Proof' (noticed I said 'favorite,' not 'best'), even if we're only going to speak of the film's immaculate cinematography, done by frequent collaborator Robert Richardson. Speaking as someone who doesn't know a great deal of anamorphic aspect ratios or the core issues with film and digital media, I'll explain the effects of Ultra Panavision 70 in layman's terms. 70mm basically allows for extremely wide-widescreen shots, allowing for a grand scope to be seen. Where full-screen typically letterboxes the sides of a film and, in turn, cuts off the sides of the image and widescreen allows those formerly subtracted sides to be seen, Panavision allows for a much wider shot to include even more than a widescreen image ever could.As a result, the film looks like what a widescreen film used to look like on your old Television set, where the imagine is a long rectangle with black bars on the top and bottom of the screen. The decision for Tarantino and Richardson to shoot 'The Hateful Eight' in this manner allows the luscious imagery of the snow-covered mountains in Wyoming to be shown with pristine detail and beauty. Even though more than half of the film takes place inside a haberdashery, Tarantino still manages to use 70mm to capture the details of characters' costumes, facial expressions, and backgrounds in a way that's simultaneously subtle and decorated.With that, 'The Hateful Eight' is also a brilliant collection of seriously compelling performances, especially from Samuel L. Jackson and Kurt Russell, both men giving very different performances. Jackson plays menacing but eloquent in a way that he hasn't quite done since 'Pulp Fiction,' while Russell shows that working with Tarantino consistently brings out the best in him as an actor. Russell needs to fire on all cylinders here, occasionally having his character be more laidback and reasonable, despite largely acting as a blunt-force ready to bash Daisy's face in whenever she steps out of line. His performance here is a truly magnificent work of diverse acting abilities, and with Tarantino's liberal runtime, he's about to include and emphasize that kind of layered acting.Being a Tarantino film, you will inevitably get your accusations of homophobia, with one particular monologue by Samuel L. Jackson that does go a bit too far in terms of not being too funny or very relevant as much as it is for shock, racism, with Tarantino's excessive use of the n-word, and misogyny thanks to the only real female role in this film being a punching bag for the men (though Leigh does indeed get time for her and her character to shine). My biggest gripe with Tarantino's unchanging style is that the violence in the last act of the film takes away from the engaging setup and grace the first act really emphasized. The slowburn opening of the film really capitalized off of a premise that was going to take its time to move from character-to-character, but Tarantino seems to be unable to remedy or push his appetite for violence and bloodshed by the wayside by the conclusion of the film.'The Hateful Eight' is still a devilishly interesting film; at nearly three hours, it's never boring and through terrific performances and seriously beautiful cinematography, reminds audiences why we love Tarantino for all that he can do and do so well. For as merciless and as violent as this film can be, it's also an undeniably great time and an aesthetic achievement for the director himself, which, in a day and age where Tarantino can pretty much say three words and make front page news, is about the most we can ask from him.",9,6,25,4 January 2016
The Adventures of Tintin," Not even a wee bit conventional
","In elementary school, The Adventures of Tintin graphic novels were the only thing I would read. I have read a majority of the books, which came in a large, hardcover format boasting three adventures in one book. That's what they were. They weren't stories, comics, or even vignettes; they were adventures. Involving, consuming, and utterly motivating adventures about a young journalist named Tintin who would go on mysteries and solve cases with his loyal companion, Snowy, an intelligent white dog.Too bad I haven't read a Tintin adventure in a blue moon, so comparing it to the original works by the Belgian author, Hergé is simply out of the question. My memory has faded and time is greatly limited. With that being said, I can say that from the vague details that I remember, the film adaptation of the comics is true to its original, breathtaking source material. The story centers around Tintin (Bell) and his dog Snowy, who are caught up in a whirlwind of trouble after purchasing an antique model ship at a European flea market. It turns out, the ship contains an ancient scroll that, when put together with two others, reveals a message. Tintin teams up with the rum-guzzling Captain Haddock (Serkis), and gets assistance from the simple and dense Thomson and Thompson (Pegg and Frost) to discover the truth about the ships and what powers the scrolls might possess.The film has a very good sense of action, and in today's world, that's one of the highest compliments I can pay to a film. We see beautifully recreated European cities, which is a break from the droning, ordinary cityscapes we are victim to so much today. I am also known to grow weary of special effects and chase scenes, but here, I was simply amused and in awe, especially by one that takes place in a skimmer plane that eventually ends up in the Sahara desert. I dare not spoil it for the viewers-to-be, but I can't remember the last time I had so much fun watching an action scene unfold.Some scenes are so tricky and complex, we wonder how Spielberg could've possibly held onto coherency while directing them. But he does. And that's the beauty of the man himself. I recently watched his underrated drama The Terminal, and noticed two things I never saw in Spielberg's work before. One, he has an uncanny sense of detail and an intricate focus on the little things in the background. He also never becomes pictorial, meaning he doesn't rely on background distractions and unnecessary supporting characters to unintentionally muddy the meaning. He's smart, attentive, and very, very crafty. The second thing I noticed is how well he directs films in condensed, claustrophobic spaces. An airport, where The Terminal took place, is not the easiest place to shoot at. Neither is deep in a cave like in Raiders of the Lost Ark, but Spielberg always does it and does it well. Some shots in Tintin are so complex, multifarious, and alive that we wonder how one man could've directed them without going mad or over-the-top. Just watch the film, then search up clips from an incoherent, maddening visual spectacle like Transformers: Dark of the Moon and you'll get two gleaming examples of art and junk.I mentioned the film is animated. That it is. I've noticed some have mistaken it for live action online. Seeing the poster in the theater, I thought it was live action as well. The film utilizes the motion capture animation I haven't been so fond of recently. After seeing the dreadful Mars Needs Moms, I thought I'd be content if I never saw the tactic used again in my life. For that film, it was absolutely needless. There was no reason to go through the extra time, money, trouble, and agony to fit actors for suits and make them act out the motions of their characters just for a lame, forgettable space cartoon. Here, it's extraordinary. It seems Peter Jackson (producer on the film) and Spielberg have discovered a way to iron out the kinks in the procedure (even though the eyes still look a bit unnatural). Some scenes, like when the three are lost at sea, are absolutely breathtaking and you may even be amazed what you're watching is animation.I fear that too many parents will rob their kids of the joyous experience The Adventures of Tintin will likely bring them. The film is filled with life, action, fun, and colors for the kids, and there's enough wit, interest, and grandiose ideas to share with the adults. It's an experience, whether you're a fan or not. Like many detective stories, it has substance in its story, but the true adventures are with the characters. Spielberg has had one of his most productive and successful years, directing a period epic, finally awarding a graphic novel with a film adaptation, and producing Real Steel, Super 8, and Transformers: Dark of the Moon. But the great thing about a film like Tintin is it knows its characters, setting, and plan inside and out, while other action films continue to 'play it by ear' to see where the next missile will land.Starring: Jamie Bell, Andy Serkis, Daniel Craig, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost. Directed by: Steve Spielberg.",9,1,1,16 March 2012
Crash," Ham-fisted and heavy-handed, and recites a message that becomes a lecture
","I was looking forward to my long-delayed viewing of Paul Haggis' Crash. I thought it would provide me with an experience along the lines of when I watched Falling Down, a breathtaking portrayal of societal arrogance, where I was riveted and infuriated for much of the film. Instead, Crash is a by-the-numbers film about America being a melting pot of racists, waiting to be set off in a cliché set up, and appears to be more of a stock lecture instead of a truly eye-opening film.I must give respect and well-earned shock to the film for winning Best Picture, over critic/fan favorite, Brokeback Mountain. Its win was probably one of the biggest stuns next to when Annie Hall bested Star Wars in 1977, or when Forrest Gump stomped both Pulp Fiction and The Shawshank Redemption for the same title in 1994. Crash is definitely an interesting piece, setting its sights on the controversial nature of racism and its victims and alarmists, but manages to plod along in its runtime, rarely reaching heights of admirable status, and manages to be questionably exploitative and, dare I say, racist in itself.The film follows numerous characters in a forty-eight hour period in Los Angeles where they are met with racial confrontations, have their personal outlooks and insights tested, and eventually, have their stories intertwined with one another in some way, shape or form, connected by the central focus; a car crash. Such characters are a black LAPD officer (Don Cheadle) who is long estranged from his mother, a white District Attorney (Brendan Fraser) and his spoiled-rotten wife (Sandra Bullock) whose car was hijacked by two young black men (Chris 'Ludicrous' Bridges and Larenz Tate), a racist white police officer (Matt Dillon), who molests a black woman (Thandie Newton) right in front of her husband (Terrence Howard), a Hispanic locksmith (Michael Pena) trying to keep his family business straight, an uptight Persian immigrant (Shaun Toub), and an optimistic cop (Ryan Phillippe), who works with Matt Dillon's character.Right off the bat, there are far too many underdeveloped characters here. The way we are greeted with them is awkward, too fast, and lacks much substance. In an ordinary anthology film with intertwining characters, take Adam Rifkin's criminally underrated and near-perfect film, LOOK for example, we spend enough time to get to know the characters, form opinions about them, and actually become intrigued and somewhat astonished at how they meet and engage with one another. Crash breathlessly tries to juggle a dozen loose stories and find creative ways for them to connect with each other that it doesn't have time to adapt its subjects into believable people. It's almost encouraging its own problem by stereotyping its characters.The film portrays all of its characters as on-the-edge racists triggered by a fairly mild, forgivable, and misunderstood circumstance where every conclusion is jumped to and nobody is smart enough to think something over before acting. Perhaps Crash is trying to show us that that, specifically, is the problem, but it is gone about in such a ham-fisted, heavy-handed way that we know what the film is trying to say, but we simply don't care and are tired of being talked down to for close to two hours.With that being said, it must too be stated that all the actors here do a wonderful job at, at least, trying to create versatile, believable characters, although few succeed. Sandra Bullock is the standout here, simply giving it her all and showing us true character-acting versatility in not only her role-choices, but her creative and involved performances. Ludicrous isn't as outgunned as I thought he'd be, Don Cheadle does exceptional work, Matt Dillon is great here, and so is the rest of the cast. But inevitably, I'm reminded of the one-dimensional characters they play and the truly vacuous background that plagues each and every one of them. A quick look at other reviewers scattered across the internet show that their shallowness has neglected people to notice the good acting behind them.The film concludes with one of the lamest, most uncreative Hollywood endings in a blue moon, showing us easily the most schmaltzy, conventional, unbelievable, cringe-inducing ending a film about racism could possible give us. Even with dedicated performances from a barrage of different talents, Crash connects their characters' stories in such a contrived and facile way it's distracting, is plagued by levels of sheer incredulity, and occupies an end scene of complete and total folderol. As a whole, it plays like a heavy-handed lecture by a representative of the 'Why Can't We All Just Get Along?' committee.Starring: Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Jennifer Esposito, Brendan Fraser, Terrence Howard, Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, Thandie Newton, Ryan Phillippe, Larenz Tate, Shaun Toub, and Michael Peña.

Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A fitting conclusion to a masterful franchise
","After the technological innovation that was the original 1977 space opera Star Wars, and its convention-defying, unbelievably dark sequel The Empire Strikes Back, my expectations for the conclusion of the iconic franchise, Return of the Jedi, were soaring into galaxies far, far away. Not long after, I fell back to Earth somewhat wowed but considerably disappointed. Return of the Jedi is a solid end to the franchise, competent, alleviating, and without a doubt, intriguing, but simultaneously bland and underwhelming. To, yet again, quote Dante Hicks from the everlasting Clerks, 'all Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.' Of course, that's a vast oversimplification of what the film really features, but it's not an inaccurate statement. The last thing I ever expected to call a Star Wars picture is artificial-looking, but it must be said. Occasionally, the film will have points of sheer beauty and marvellous technology. Consider the briskly-paced sequence where Luke and Leia race through the forestry, evading a slew of enemies closely on their tale. Yet, frequently, much of the film looks like it was shot on the backlots of studios where the presence of a fully-designed set was dually noted. The mystifying qualities about space's contents and other-worldly galaxies seems to have been traded for modestly-interesting scenes, confined to solid land mimicking that of a forest preserve. It looks good. Not beautiful.The second issue comes when we spend much of the film either listening to Ewokese or dealing with the language's speakers, the Ewoks, which don't even seem to belong in a Star Wars. The past gangs of creatures we've had to see, whether it be the Jawas or the Ugnaughts, were at least interesting, mysterious creatures. The Ewoks possess a cute, cuddly, warm persona that feels alien (pun intended) to the world of Star Wars. Not to mention, they often feel like cute, cuddly distractions to the more interesting plot developments and set-ups we're dealing with here.For example, the drama between Luke Skywalker (reprised by Mark Hamill) and his newfound father Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) would've been the perfect thing to predicate this entire film on, rather than more or less shifting it to the side so we can watch the gaggle of Ewoks interact with their own culture and the new humans placed in the middle of it.Another thing I began to start to get frustrated at with The Empire Strikes Back is its focus on the cutesy relationship between Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Leia (Carrie Fisher). There's really no surprise that there is a relationship in 'the greatest franchise in history,' but did it have to be this hesitant, restrained, and plodded out for three movies? Because both characters refuse to recognize their feelings strongly until the second movie, we get an abundance of joking dialog, senseless banter, and redundant little arguments between the two that easily become more obnoxiously spliced in than entertaining. This relationship either needed to not have begun or been greatly minimized here. Not shifted more towards the foreground.However, I fear I'm making Return of the Jedi sound like the worst movie-going experience this side of the Millennium Falcon. There are still scenes of genuine ambition and prevalent imagination here, and the fact that George Lucas co-wrote this picture Empire writer Lawrence Kasdan gives more of the vibe that Lucas wrapped this story up the he wanted to. While Empire, my personal favorite of the original trilogy, benefited tremendously from Lucas' bravery in welcoming new talent to the film, it's nice to see the original pioneer, regardless of my opinions on him, finish what he started and finish it the way he wants it. I can respect that above all. Even the director at hand here, Richard Marquand, is given a nice range of variety, regardless of whether or not it's good variety. There is still a respectable amount of creativity and life in this project, despite its gradual inferiority to its predecessors.The Star Wars films, as stated in my blog post before I finally sat down to watch them, formally stood as an annoying little blind spot in my rear-view that I was too lazy to wipe clean. When I finally did, I realized what I was missing. When you see this films in present day, there still is no lost wonder or the overwhelming feeling of datedness. It feels just as fresh, moving, and powerful as a thrilling sci-fi epic made in recent time. Return of the Jedi isn't necessarily the way I wanted the entire series to end (for, I would've rather had some more of the unrelenting darkness and bleak storytelling Empire used to its success), yet I simply can't bring myself to say I didn't like the film mainly because I feel that it's a pretty creative piece in and of itself. It's a fine movie that deserves its place in history, regardless of my opinion.Starring: Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, and James Earl Jones (voice).

Fast & Furious 6," A franchise that has over-corrected enough to finally get back on track
","Fast & Furious 6 picks up on our trusted gang of gearhead criminals following the heist they pulled off in Rio de Janeiro that took place in Fast Five. Now, all of Dom Toretto's (Vin Diesel) crew are fugitives, including the retired FBI agent Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and his wife Mia (Jordana Brewster), Dom's sister with whom he now has a child. The family are now living in Rio de Janeiro off of the $100 million sum of cash they stole and are trying to maintain normalcy into adulthood. One day, the U.S. Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson), who previously tried to stop Dom and his gang's efforts to pull off the heist, has discovered potentially revolutionary information on Dom's allegedly deceased girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who was seen alive and taken by a vicious British Special Forces officer named Owen Shaw (Luke Evans).The bottom line is Shaw needs to be taken down and Hobbs knows that Dom, Brian, and Mia, despite being a family, have the skill-set and power to take down Shaw. Hobbs agrees to allow them entry into the United States once again on a citizen status rather than fugitive one, to which they accept. Reassembling their team of Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Han (Sang Kung), and Tej (Ludicrous), the gang looks to take down yet another criminal mastermind no international organization in the world can touch and only a group of skilled racers can infiltrate.Fast Five was a film that bothered me in numerous respects, but mostly because it seemed that it did nothing more than sell out the core principles of what its franchise was founded upon in order to pull in a greater audience. The sad part was, through all the physics-defying flashiness and stunt chases, even the core fanbase of the series fell for its tricks, and the film went on to be declared the best in the franchise by many critics and audiences. Having said all that, going into Fast & Furious 6 knowing that this new gritty, crime-drama style the series has been implementing since Fast & Furious, the fourth installment, was still going to be in effect, I was about as hesitant as ever.I emerge from the film with the confidence in saying that Fast & Furious 6 is the best film in the series since 2 Fast 2 Furious, a film that for all its issues, is still a fine piece of action-comedy during a year where that genre thrived (the underrated Hollywood Homicide, for one, also came out that same year). This is a film that has it both ways: it's a slick and stylish film predicated upon car racing and vehicular muscle and a strong crime-drama that keeps its characters in perspective through all its gritty style.Fast & Furious 6 touches more on pathos than the previous installments; it cuts through the blatant homoerotic relation the male characters have with other male characters and the fetishization of their vehicles to reveal a deep humanity in regards to relationships. Consider when Dom finds out the high possibility his girlfriend he believed to be deceased is now still alive and, despite being incredulously so, she doesn't remember him at all upon seeing him again. These scenes are revealing because, for once, behind all the glitz and glamour of this franchise, these characters, in addition to the audience, can step back and see the individuals behind the wheel as people (the humans crushed in the scene that takes place on a highway, involving a tank going the wrong way and demolishing every car in its path don't get the same luxury of being humanized, but an installment in this series has yet to be perfect). The emotions don't run saccharine-thick, but they are present, and unless you've let the macho physiques of Diesel and Johnson get the best of you throughout the course of this film and the last, you should at least be able to respect the film's intentions and see what it's doing.Then there's the fact that this film, unlike the last three before it, is plain fun. The characters are more unified in this film, working together and asserting their own personalities rather than just ostensibly working off of one another in a contrived manner in Fast Five. The conversational banter between characters here is also, for the first time since 2 Fast 2 Furious, strong in a way that's witty and enjoyable, though not overdone like in the aforementioned film. Finally, the film's slickness and gritty story doesn't become a downbeat array of fistfights and shootouts like in Fast Five. Everything feels, even for a Hollywood action film, delicately handled and even modeled in a way that emphasized slowburn pacing with humans at the core.Fast & Furious 6 still finds itself overwrought in terms of further distancing itself from the downhome realism in the first film to the point where its inclusion is about as minuscule as a spec of dust on one's rearview mirror. Having said that, when it comes to The Fast and the Furious franchise rebranding itself, this is a more assured and capable spectacle that doesn't feel like it's pandering or selling out, but truly embracing the souls many of us have followed for over twelve years now. Director Justin Lin and screenwriter Chris Morgan, who have handled the directing and writing jobs, respectively, for every installment in the franchise since Tokyo Drift, have finally come to the point where they're not only respecting those involved in the projects, but also the audience.Starring: Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Sang Kung, and Luke Evans.

Final Destination 2," Remains on the right track.
","Here we have sequel, that is essentially the same as the first film, but provides a lot more thrills and a lot more special effects than the first. Final Destination 2 has the same scheme as its predecessor - the hero of the film, this time a female named Kimberly (Cook), is on a road-trip with her best friend and her two pot smoking buddies. She has a premonition on the road that she is one of the many victims to a deadly traffic pileup. She blocks the on-ramp so no one can get by, the premonition comes true, various people survive, but are then killed off in the order they would've died if she hadn't blocked the road. There we have Final Destination 2.It's safe to say we get more of a variety in our characters this time around. In the original, it was all students aboard a flight to Paris. This time, we have a student, a mother, a teacher, a lottery winner, a pregnant women, a drug-addict, a self-centered woman, and a police officer. Clear Rivers (Larter) from the original film returns here to pair up with Kimberly and police officer Thomas Burke (Landes) to try and stop death's design.The idea is we all have a fate, but the flaw is we can cheat it. In this case, Kimberly and the crew's fate was to die in the pileup, but due to her lucky premonition everyone is saved. After you cheat death and save yours and many other lives the only way you can prevent the rest of the gang from dying is for the person who had the premonition to commit suicide or have a child being born, creating new life somehow saving the rest of the people. You're better off not to question the idea, and just go along for the ride.The special effects in this are sub-par to the first film. The problem with the first film was that some of the death sequences were at night, and some, didn't involved many crafty designs, or twists and turns, most likely because it was the first of its kind. They didn't know their standard. But still, Final Destination had some memorable and quite impressive death scenes. Especially when you consider frequent hidden hints and '180' appearances.Final Destination 2 offers a bit more build-up by showing something falling, shifting, sliding, moving, etc. The trigger effect that leads to these deaths is perfect, and reminds me why I love this franchise. It can go above and beyond everything if it just remains realistic and plausible.There are a few problems sadly. For one thing, some scenes in the morgue and the mental-institute are poor build-ups to the main event. They last long, and tend to ramble. It's best to try and make the rule make sense to you, rather than listen to a bunch of people talk about it. My advice; watch the first film. Watch it again. Get an idea of how this design works, and then continue to watch the remaining films in the franchise. Eventually, it will come to you. Patience is a virtue.One question I asked myself in the first film was 'Why Alex?' Up until about halfway through, I asked 'Why Kimberly?' The film provides logical information on why it's Kimberly's turn to have the premonition. But I still I have two questions; (1) Why does this premonition aspect exist if its purpose is to mess up Death's plan? Don't you think Death (I love how I'm using him as a real person right now) would try everything to stop this premonition? And the premonition sequence lasted about four minutes in this film. You couldn't tell me Kimberly sat stopped on the on-ramp, in utter silence with two talkative pot-buddies in the back seat and her annoying blonde friend without them shaking her or talking to her, and no one from other cars behind her came up to knock on her window. They took all the plausibility, pumped it into the death sequences in the film, but at the same time, drained it from the events leading up to the deaths. Never heard of that happening.Clearly, I'm over-analyzing what is supposed to be an enjoyable horror flick. That it was. Final Destination still remains calm, and not cocky, and cartoonish like one would think. While some franchises get carried away, for now, Final Destination is on the right track.Starring: Ali Larter, A. J. Cook, Michael Landes, and Tony Todd. Directed by: David R.

Knocked Up," One big, laundry list of ethics-questions with enormous sprinklings of humor
","Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) is the definition of a guy who 'means well,' but is also the definition of a total geek. He's sweet and sincere, but hopelessly unromantic in his many episodes of pot-smoking, dirty jokes, and vulgarity. Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) is an employee for the E! TV network, who is extremely career-minded, especially after she finally gets the job interviewing celebrities on air. Only at a club after too many drinks would these people ever meet and have sex, and fate says that they do, and fate includes that they wake up the next morning with almost no memory of what happened the night before.Ben and Alison proceed to get breakfast, before hesitantly exchanging numbers and going about their ways. Ben clearly wants Alison to like him, but she seems passively repulsed by, what she sees, as vacuous immaturity. Regardless, eight weeks later, Alison begins throwing up at work, unpredictably, and rushes home to take a pregnancy test. Well, dozens of pregnancy tests, aided by her sister Debbie (Leslie Mann) and her husband Pete (Paul Rudd). She is in fact pregnant and then tracks down Ben through his homemade, film-nudity-tracking website to inform of this occurrence. Now, both lives are enormously affected by one small mistake and the two of them must try and survive the labors (no pun intended) of pregnancy and the stress that comes with it.This doesn't sound like the makings of a four-star comedy, but I assure you, reader, it is. Judd Apatow's Knocked Up is one of the most fun comedies I've seen in a while, perfectly amplifying, while simultaneously furthering the genre of raunch-with-heart. This isn't the nihilistic, hopelessly cynical comedy one would anticipate, but rather a sweet comedy, with strong sprinklings of raunchiness, all encapsulated with a shell of poignancy and life-revelations.Only in a great comedy are the supporting characters just as good as the lead characters and there are a plethora of talents in Knocked Up. From Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Jason Segel, and Martin Starr all doing a terrific job at playing Ben's sardonic best friends, there are Debbie and Paul, the only real married couple in the film. Debbie and Paul - who got their own feature film five years after Knocked Up - deal with marital issues that are likely normative in the married life of couples today. Debbie believes in a very controlled, disciplined way of governing her husband and their two children, while Paul believes in a more relaxed, laidback way of parenting. This causes, as expected, an uproar in their marriage, and also causes a pleasant ethics debate for the audience. Is Debbie's disciplining helping or hurting the family? Is Pete in the right position to be sort of 'taking nights off from the family?' Come to think of it, Knocked Up, as a whole, is one big ethics question. A 'what would you do?' question appears every few minutes for the audience to answer, and thankfully, the presence of the questions doesn't overshadow the humor or vice-versa. Aside from being just another comedy that provides roughly two hours of pleasant escapism, Knocked Up, in retrospect, provides roughly two hours of marital questions and situations, while combining in the humor to seem more like a presentable package.The winning ingredient for Knocked Up is definitely its heart and its smart focus on the poignancy of pregnancy, especially that of a one-night stand. While this in particular is a rare case, it is nonetheless a realistic one, provided by strong instances of comedy and, yet, strong instances of sadness and sorrow. The scene when Ben and Alison find out their reckless night of debauchery results in a pregnancy is downright soul-crushing, even though you know it's coming. In the blink of an eye, both lives are changed and they're changed so much that the only response is to cry.And yet, there are scenes of pure hilarity and fun. Take for example the scene when Alison first meets Ben's goofball friends, or when an unexpected earthquake hits, or even the subplot involving a bet that Martin Starr's character can't shave his beard for the entire year. While Knocked Up tackles some brutally honest notions and occurrences in the lives of pregnant couples and married people, it nevertheless shows the fun side of life. What some of this all boils down to is nerds having fun being nerds.Knocked Up is more-or-less a roller-coaster, as the real world often is. There are ups, there are downs, there is unconditional happiness, there is unconditional sadness. The humanity the film evokes is nearly nonexistent in the mainstream comedies today, but writer/director/co-producer Apatow knows married life, knows the quirks and hilarity in certain situations, and also knows the time when to be downright realistic and, well, sad. His material from this point looked as if he could only evolve and he certainly did. He is one of the strongest comedy-writers and directors working today.Starring: Seth Rogen. Katherine Heigl, Paul Rudd, Leslie Mann, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Jason Segel, and Martin Starr. Directed by: Judd Apatow.",10,1,4,11 June 2013
Blades of Glory," Light on humor, but heavy on theatrics
","One of the newest things for comedies to satire are activities that have been officially called sports, yet they're activities we can't help but subtly sneer at. Balls of Fury gave ping-pong a quirky satire, The Big Year would go on to showcase the eccentric sport of birding (bird-watching), and Will Speck and Josh Gordon's Blades of Glory gives us a predominately genial, high-spirited comedy on the competitive nature of professional figure-skating. And who better to carry out the challenge than comedian extraordinare Will Ferrell and relative newcomer Jon Heder, still riding off of the Napoleon Dynamite fame three years after its release? What Blades of Glory reminds all of us of is Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, one of Ferrell's previous comedies and, for those who enjoyed that film or whole-heartedly loathed it, could suffer by comparison for better or for worse. For one thing, Blades of Glory provides us with a glossier, more aesthetically attractive atmosphere, concocted off of set-pieces, stunning skate techniques, entertaining theatricalities, and a story of over competitive hatred between two professionals that transcends into bonding and teamwork. On my checklist, that's quite a lot for a satire on figure-skating to include.The film opens by showing us the 2002 World Winter Sports Games, where we are introduced to the extremely talented and proclaimed sex addict figure skater Chazz Michael Michaels (Will Ferrell) and the equally talented, yet effeminate Jimmy MacElroy (Jon Heder). Both men get a few minutes to show off their true talent before getting into a huge fight on the ice, leading to their expulsion from figure-skating entirely.Three and a half years later, Jimmy works at a sporting goods store, while Chazz, who has gained weight and become even more addicted on alcohol and sex. It would appear that their lives, now well past the line of obscurity, will continue to spiral in the downward direction, until an obsessed fan (Nick Swardson) informs Jimmy that he was only banned from individual skating and not from pair skating, thanks to a contract loophole. Jimmy nabs his old coach Robert (Craig T. Nelson), who gets him Chazz as a last minute partner so he can compete.The remainder of the film centers on Chazz and Jimmy training for the big championship in figure-skating, with intentions to beat Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg (Will Arnett and Amy Poehler), the brother and sister pair who have become increasingly cunning and manipulative in their desire to win.One of the most pleasing additions to Blades of Glory is its surprising lack of humor targeted at homosexuals. Don't misread that sentence, for it's still present, mainly toward s the clean and slightly feminine Jimmy. But with homosexuality bearing a notable presence in the figure-skating world, it's nice to see the film not take the easy way out and go for the unfairly-achieved gold.Blades of Glory is about as good as a satire about figure-skating can be. The jokes are largely hit or miss, the performers are capable, if a tad uneven, and the direction by Speck and Gordon is at least efficient enough to take seriously. This isn't likely to go down in the books as a satire of epic proportions, but as far as slapstick, goofball comedies go, it's smart enough and snappy enough to show you a more earnest good time.Starring: Will Ferrell, Jon Heder, Will Arnett, Amy Poehler, Craig T. Nelson, William Fichtner, Jenna Fischer, and Romany Malco. Directed by: Will Speck and Josh Gordon.",6,1,2,6 February 2013
The Polar Express," Cinemagic
","The Polar Express is a rare exercise in pure cinemagic, where everything is dreamlike and exists in a world run on the motor of whimsy. It's a beautiful looking film, with every shot so mindbogglingly detailed and every action sequence so paralyzing in its charm and excitement. I can only imagine the everlasting impact an IMAX experience would've had on me as a longtime cinema-goer.I have major sympathy for the parents of America, who year after year, are likely subjected to the lowest common denominator of family entertainment at home and at the cinema. When rating a family film, I ask the question, 'is it fun for the kids?' and then ask, 'is it fun for the adults?' They pay the ticket price; don't you feel they should share the enjoyment of what is being on screen and not just hope to see something resembling the beginning of a long line of end credits? Bless the fact that Pixar films have begun to take the attention of anxious kids and parents, and at least during the Christmastime in 2004, The Polar Express lurked in theaters for weeks so that the masses could be treated to the beautiful qualities imaginative cinema had to offer.I'm positive everyone knows the story to the beloved children's book, penned in 1985. On the night of Christmas Eve, a young boy, skeptical about the idea of Santa Claus, is taken on a journey after seeing an enormous train pull up to his front yard with the train conductor (one of the five characters Tom Hanks voices in the film, not including the narrator) proudly shouting, 'all abooooooard,' before taking the young boy and several other nearby children on the ride of their life. Their destination is obviously the North Pole, where the kids can hopefully meet Santa Claus and receive a present for their good behavior this year. During the long ride, the young boy (who remains nameless, along with most of the others on board) meets a young black girl and a young boy named Billy, and the three children wind up having the ride of their life, as they not only avoid several scenes of uncertainty, but challenge the perilous conditions brought on to them by using quick and wise judgment. Not to mention, these three kids are just absolutely lovable. You're Scrooge if the children's beautiful song at the back of the train doesn't summon a tear to your eye.The film exercises our unalienable right to imagine and dream. What kind wouldn't have wanted to take a ride on The Polar Express at age eight or nine? When I was small, my town held a little 'Polar Express' event where children go board a train and cruise through nearby towns. It was a less than memorable experience. The singing was mild, the people weren't as fun, and the rule about hot chocolate wasn't in place because it was already broken by the time we received it.If I would've seen something like The Polar Express in IMAX theaters, say, nine years ago, I would've been delighted. The kids who appreciate the most will be between seven and ten because the film gears itself to more mature children, who are still possibly clinging to that last bit of childhood innocence that is believing in Santa Claus. This picture shows that magic continues to exist long after your beliefs are over, and paints the most lavish and awe-inspiring portrait of the holidays that I have ever seen.Director Robert Zemeckis, the laudable visionary of Back to the Future, provides us with one of cinema's many landmark, this one being for the digital age. This is the first film in history to utilize the motion-capture style of animation for the entire length. Motion-capture animation is when actors are fitted for special suits and proceed to act out the motions of their character, which will be converted to digital animation using computers. In recent times, let's take for example, Mars Needs Moms, a later picture by Zemeckis that left loads to be desired, the medium was gimmicky and unnecessary. Here, it's extremely enchanting. The inherent zombification of the human characters isn't explicitly found like in other motion-capture animation films, and it provides for nothing but smoothness in the sequences when The Polar Express flies off the train tracks and on to a bed of ice. Even the scenes with Santa's sleigh, zipping and zooming past a crowd of thousands looks beautifully enhanced thanks to this medium. This is one of the most detailed and great looking films ever made.The Polar Express is a magnificent cinematic achievement in terms of look and feel. The action sequences are brilliantly staged, offering up the feeling of placement and depth instead of giving us indistinct location shots and messy editing skills. Everything is clear, broad, and vivid, and the characters are innocent and easy to love. The film has been compared to a roller coaster ride in a derogative manner, but turning that around to fit a positive connotation, the picture gives us one of the most fun cinematic rides in recent history, visually and emotionally.Voiced by: Tom Hanks. Directed by: Robert Zemeckis.",10,1,4,29 December 2012
Malcolm X," We started this fire
","The Civil Rights movement was such a broad area in history, and with the countless number of events that took place, such as the Montgomery bus boycott, the Freedom Rides, and the sit ins, it's a wonder why we haven't been bombarded with films focusing on those events. I have no doubt that one movie could possibly focus on everything that happened in the Civil Rights era, but I doubt it could do a very good job. Spike Lee has chosen one of the most unsung leaders of the movement, and has constructed, from the ground up, a film over three hours in length on him showing his humble beginnings, his rise to power, his self-assessment, and his tragic death.The leader is Malcolm X. But before he was an historical figure, he was Malcolm Little, a small-time thief who would concoct schemes to steal money with his best friend, Shorty. He was a smart boy, with a preacher for a father and a white woman for a mother. Despite being very smart, he was ostracized by white teachers who said that his dreams of becoming a lawyer wouldn't happen and that he should stick to 'working with his hands.' Little's adolescence consisted of running around with white girls and devising burglaries with them and Shorty. This streak didn't last long, with Little and Shorty being arrested and sentenced to eight years in prison. Without a doubt, prison benefited Little in unlikely ways. He was taught the ways of Elijah Muhammad, the leader of the Nation of Islam, and got help for his addiction to cocaine by a fellow inmate.Muhammad's teachings eventually inspired Malcolm to become a motivational speaker, before becoming one of the many voices in the Civil Rights movement. He adopts the name 'Malcolm X,' he claims, because 'X' in mathematics represents 'the unknown.' For a while, X preached the direct opposite from Martin Luther King Jr. King believed in integration, that would hopefully result from a nonviolent practice. X thought integrating with 'the enemy' was not intelligent, and questioned why would we want to integrate with a group that has subtracted our rights, raped our women, and has dehumanized us? For a while, the only thing X said he liked integrated was 'his coffee.' I tried to put myself in the shoes of a middle aged African American, living in the south, in the 1960's, and contemplated who I, myself, would've sided with. King would probably have been the initial person I would've sided with, but after many months that proved little to no success, I would've likely started to follow X and his teachings of self defense and segregation.The entire film is marvelous in every sense of the word. Spike Lee has proved himself to be one of America's greatest directors with one stellar drama after another, focusing mainly on racial tensions. Here, he brilliantly documents an underrated leader whose philosophy may have been sketchy, but wrote speeches that were undeniably powerful.X is portrayed by Denzel Washington, who utters every line with sophistication and always occupies a convincing state. The whole tone of the film can be summed up in one scene that comes rather late in the film. It shows Malcolm X walking up the stairs to Columbia University, where he is stopped by a white woman asking what she could do to further his movement. He coldly replies 'nothing' before marching on his way. The camera is left focusing on the frozen, heartbroken woman. The great thing about a scene like this is that it wasn't motivated by a comic relief. Lee adds hints of comedy throughout the film, but not many seeing as this is a touchy subject. He feels he should attack it with brutal honesty rather than turn the whole movement into a laugh riot. Other performances, like Angela Bassett as Malcolm's wife, and Al Freeman Jr. as Elijah Muhammad, provide the film with some of its strongest material as well.I believe the reason the character of Malcolm X was so interesting is because he is capable of delivering self assessment and self criticism. Not many leaders are still developing their beliefs, but are rather wholly confident in what they preach. X finally realized he had flaws as a human, and went through a change of heart upon traveling to Mecca, an event that is captured beautifully in the film, and came back a whole different person. Instead of attacking Civil Rights leaders, mainly Martin Luther King Jr., and making them feel inferior, he agrees to work with them to pursue the dream of equality in the world.Malcolm X is one of the most surreal and extensive biopics I have yet to see. Its script is extremely powerful, and refuses to become dry and noneventful. Lee's direction is pitch perfect, and the tone either feels coldly realistic or unsettling even in when it reaches its brightest instances. Just like the man himself, Lee's film has proved to go under the radar, not boasting a great deal on the surface. But when put into an intricate focus and dissected delicately, it is one of the best films that deals with racial tensions, next to De Niro's A Bronx Tale, and one of the smartest films of the nineties decade.Starring: Denzel Washington, Angela Bassett, and Al Freeman Jr. Directed by: Spike Lee.",10,2,5,19 February 2012
Black Mass," A game of 'cops and robbers' taken far beyond the playground
","Scott Cooper's 'Black Mass' features arguably the best ensemble cast of the year, with Johnny Depp at the helm in perhaps his best, most convincing performance of the last decade. Following a string of financial failures and lackluster projects, particularly this year's 'Mortdecai,' where I proclaimed in my review that if this didn't kill Depp's assortment of eclectic projects, nothing would, Depp, like always, changes costumes and throws himself into yet another role. His performance as the notorious James 'Whitey' Bulger should go down as one of the year's most haunting.In 'Black Mass,' Bulger is a cackling, dead-eyed, ruthless killer, bound to pull the trigger or get one of his goons to do so at the slightest sign of disloyalty in his inner-circle of equally heartless men. He often sits in stone-cold silence, and when he chooses to speak, he never misses a beat, stammers, or retracts on his statements; he's too assured and confident for that. He knows when to talk, he knows how to cover things up, and he knows exactly how to manipulate and stay in control.This is undoubtedly why he rose to prominence and became the leader of organized crime in South Boston. The brother of Massachusetts Senator Billy Bulger (Benedict Cumberbatch), Bulger keeps his brother from having the state government infiltrate and corrupt his turf, in addition to being an FBI informant to help take down rival Mafia families. He provides tips and kickbacks to FBI Agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton), a lifelong friend of Whitey and Billy's, who shares the same concepts of loyalty that Whitey does. With two divisions that could potentially send his Winter Hill Gang to jail taken care of, Whitey's biggest concern now is managing his team and making sure members of other Mafia families do not attempt to overthrow his power.In the background are people like Charles McGuire (Kevin Bacon), Connolly's boss, who is dumbfounded as to why, despite all the effort and work Connolly has put into Bulger, he can't bring him down, Robert Fitzpatrick (Adam Scott), another coworker of Connolly's, Stephen Flemmi (Rory Cochrane), Whitey's right-hand man who usually has a rifle in his hand, Deborah Hussey (Juno Temple), a young prostitute who gets caught up in Stephen and Whitey's business, and Kevin Weeks (Jesse Plemons), a young man who is taken under the wing of Whitey for his diligence and level-headed attitude, and whom eventually came through to the FBI to help bust Whitey in 2011.Many crime-dramas feel like vignettes of violence, drinking, negotiating, and cursing, and 'Black Mass''s pacing is a bit more evident of its looseness than other slickly edited pictures of the genre ('Casino' comes to mind, for one). However, the acting here is a powerhouse display of natural talent on everybody's part, even the lesser players like Scott and Temple, who are almost guaranteed to get minimal to no recognition.Edgerton's constant balance of working to assist his force and remain loyal to his lifelong pal is one that is shown through his character's high stress levels and constant workaholic nature, an acting challenge he handles beautifully by conveying just what his character feels smothered by. Cumberbatch, while a lesser pawn in this film, no doubt, is another incredibly watchable presence here, who is simply trying to do his job whilst ignoring the brazen criminal activity of his brother. Other supporting players, like Cochrane and Plemons, do a great job at just being very natural and human, thanks to Cooper's observant direction, which I'll get back to, and, finally, there's Kevin Bacon, who talks like a Southie victim to a year's worth of nasal congestion. A gripping performance from Kevin Bacon is hard to come by in this day and age, but he nails his character's attributes all the way through, by sometimes being as argumentative and dictative as the mob bosses he's going after.Moreover, while much of this acting comes together because of the actors' natural strengths, the film also works because Cooper (who directed 2013's tragically underrated 'Out of the Furnace') knows how to handle over a dozen different talents at once, and how to showcase them. He takes the inhuman and makes them human, with lingering shots of facial expressions, particularly eyes (consider a key scene that focuses on Cochrane after an almost inevitable, but guilt-ridden death), and careful, mannered movements of his characters. Partly why I feel Depp shines so much in this film is because Cooper knows what to focus on with him when it comes to showing off his skills as an actor, and with that, 'Black Mass' becomes an observant film of human sensibilities.'Black Mass' is a great way to kick off awards season, and its ensemble cast, all of whom at different points in their career, makes the film hold a variety of appeal. Its pacing and structure may be a little loose, but its loose ends are largely held together by the powerhouse display of directorial and acting talent on display at all times here. We're lucky to get one good crime drama a year, and this year, we're very lucky to have gotten 'Black Mass.'",9,1,10,18 September 2015
The Town," Do the people cause the town pressure or does the town cause the people the pressure?
","It's an understatement to say that Ben Affleck's first directorial effort, Gone Baby Gone, took audiences by surprise. Here was the man who, just a few years back, was Matt Murdoch in a rather hokey adaptation of Daredevil, was plastered on the cover of tabloids with Jennifer Lopez in his arms, which brewed untold ridicule, and was caught up in a whirlwind of uncertainty as an actor. I hate to continue to ride on Affleck's past, but after seeing Gone Baby Gone and The Town, two films promoting the fact that the man is serious about coming back to the industry with a serious, no-nonsense persona, I'd love for him to be the poster-child of actors turned directors that can show others change in the industry can come whenever and, if you're serious, you can be accepted and praised highly.For the most part, The Town works on both the levels it wants to, which are as efficient action entertainment and commentary on the world of robbery and the culture of criminality. We are introduced to Charlestown, Massachusetts, a gray, gloomy city built on crime and robberies. The town is known for its explicit burglaries conducted by four men, unidentified by police. To us, they are Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), James 'Jem' Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert 'Gloansy' Magloan (Slaine), and Desmond 'Dez' Elden (Owen Burke).The film opens with the men, strapped with masks and automatic weapons, conducting a robbery on a bank and finishing the job by taking the manager, Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall), hostage, only to release her shortly after. Not long after the robbery, Doug becomes romantically involved with Claire, keeping his relationship a secret from the mob and the mob a secret from his relationship. In the meantime, Doug consistently contemplates leaving the mob life in Charlestown behind to favor smaller, less stressful life in the suburbs. If only he wasn't burdened and constantly threatened by the unpredictable Jem, who goes from calm to belligerent in an instant. Jem is played wonderfully by Renner, in a performance light years away from his character in The Hurt Locker. Doug's pressure also continues to skyrocket when he learns that FBI Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) is explicitly tracking his mob crew and is slowly closing in on them.Affleck takes on triple duty in the film, playing the lead role, director, and co-writer for this large project. His directing talents are employed greatly during the chase sequences in the film, which are photographed with piercing kinetic fun and stunning visual clarity. Affleck forgoes quick-cuts and a shaky camera, and instead, uses the tactics of two to three second cuts and realism in the chase scenes in order to elevate the picture's use of them. And what I mean by realism is, when a police car turns a tight corner in a compressed alley-way, he doesn't slickly turn but almost completely spins out. In a time where chase scenes look too clean and special effects the prime tool to construct an action movie, it's strikes me as refreshing to see one rely on wit and realistic movement.The film's first act is equipped with a fine eye for detail, specifically in the shootout sequences and the robberies, and includes seriously compelling character development on McCray. The second and third act continue to focus more on the character aspect, which at times, unfortunately, feels a little weighted, but those scenes can not bog down what is clearly a fun, incredibly entertaining action film, with depth and style at its core. Again, much like in his debut, Affleck feels comfortable directing a picture of this caliber, and he feels confident assuming the lead role and penning the script as well. The way he makes Boston's murky grayness into its own breathing character is something along the lines of Clint Eastwood's directorial efforts, which is a remarkable and admirably talented feat. As long as he isn't distracted by dead-end projects, it would appear that the man has a long, eventful career ahead of him in his later life.Starring: Ben Affleck, Jon Hamm, Rebecca Hall, Blake Lively, Jeremy Renner, Pete Postlethwaite, and Chris Cooper.

Closer," The ugliness we don't want to want
","Mike Nichols' Closer is a rough blow to any soul who considers themselves a hopeless romantic or somebody who believes in unconditional, true love at first sight. Having recently been involved in an incredibly open, romantic friendship that had me caught under love's uncompromising spell only to be slammed down by hardened reality and poor circumstance, Nichols' film is just the kind of bitter but brutally honest work on the subject I needed. Here is a film that recognizes the human desire for truth and honesty, and the simultaneous closure and pain it can provide, whilst examining, paradoxically, how much pain and suffering true love can leave someone.The film opens in London, with two strangers, Alice Ayres (Natalie Portman) and Dan Woolf (Jude Law), catching each others eyes on a crowded street before Alice is unexpectedly hit by a taxi in the crosswalk. Dan takes her to the hospital, where she remains stable and discharged soon after, and the two strike up a companionship obviously destined for some kind of romantic relationship along the line. She is an American woman who worked as a stripper before coming to live in London, and he's a failed British author who now writes obituaries for a London-based newspaper.A year later, though Alice and Dan are in a relationship, Dan begins to minimize his loyalty by flirting and sharing a kiss with an American photographer named Anna Cameron (Julia Roberts), who is photographing him for his upcoming novel on Alice's life. When Anna comes over one day to photograph Alice, Dan secretly asks Anna to have an affair with him, to which she refuses. Alice overhears the conversation but pretends like she didn't, even as she notices Dan stalking Anna for the next year. One day, Dan posing as Anna in a cybersex chatroom manages to match her up with Larry Gray (Clive Owen), a British dermatologist, by convincing him to meet her at an aquarium, a place where Anna is known to go. The two meet, realize they were played, presume it was by Dan, and go on to lead a romantic relationship; Dan hopes this will deter his feelings for Anna and rekindle contentment with Alice, but alas, it only makes him more jealous of Anna.Closer concerns the kind of deception and deceit that comes into play when the characters begin meeting and interacting with one another. Eventually, Larry meets Alice, and Dan meets Larry, resulting in several different relationships brewing on many different levels of hostility and contempt. The characters are only seen in the same room once, as Nichols and writer Patrick Marber, who penned the play the film is based on, allow each individual relationship to take on its own level of singularity rather than lumping the characters together in one gigantic scene.Holding the film together are the performances of the actors at hand, each capitalizing off of a sole trait that makes them interesting and believably flawed. Alice, despite working as a stripper and willing to do pretty much anything for anyone, still radiates a childlike sense of whimsy and innocence, often playing like she doesn't know the entirety of what's occurring before her. Dan is restless, never settling down and always looking for something better, whilst, in the process, ruins the lives of the three other characters in the film. Anna has a neediness to her; a neediness to be loved and cared for, similar to Alice, that makes her not pitiable but relatable on a human level, mimicking our very desire to be appreciated and cherished. Finally, there's Larry, who replicates methods by using either blunt force, hungering for the truth in a more brash, vulgar manner than Dan, all while trying to remain civil even in the most unsavory circumstances.Consider the scene where Larry demands to know what Anna sees in Dan, particularly their love-making and how it is different or similar to their own intimacy. At first, Anna refrains from graphic details, but soon plays Larry's game of brutal honest, dishing out the details that he simultaneously does and doesn't want to know. This part hits close to home for me; while I want to know the details of things, I often wish I hadn't and dwell upon them for a considerable amount of time. Nichols and Marber question of whether or not it's better to know and dwell, for at least you have the knowledge of the situation, or be blissfully ignorant of the acts of your significant other and operate with a comforting sense of tunnel vision.At its core, however, this is an incredibly upsetting film, especially for those who like their films about love romantic and picturesque. Those who enjoy romance films treating love as a fallacy and akin to the kind of pretty pictures on post-cards shouldn't even bother picking this one up, unless they want to see any form of concrete reality. Closer may not be pretty, but it's brutally honest, and emphasizes the paradox of love's pleasure and pain, and works best if you know such feelings and what they can bring to a person. This is an incredibly underrated, compelling adult drama, cleanly executing character investment and motivations on top of etching in under-explored ideas about a topic that is heavily explored.",9,1,2,11 February 2015
Battleship Potemkin," A few thoughts on a widely regarded masterpiece
","NOTE: This is not a conventional review; this is my required response to Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin for my college course Intro to Film & Screen Studies...Cinema, both domestic and foreign, owes a lot to Sergei Eisenstein for creating not only one of the most successful propaganda films with Battleship Potemkin, but one of the most successful examples of montage in history. Eisenstein employs a wide variety of subversive montage styles here, some considered tonal ones that string together a continuous feeling that rubs off on an audience, some for the purpose of continuity and consistency in events, and some for the purpose of putting grandiose, large-scale sequences into a specified perspective, though all significant in their own right.One of the most jarring inclusions of structurally conflicting shots is the famous shot of the statue of the lion, which is shown sleeping, awakening, and rising all in the matter of about two seconds. These static images, when strung together, inspire the kind of momentary shock we, the audience, have upon watching Eisenstein concoct a film so raucous and battle-hungry that it's as if the lion is replicating our personal feelings whilst watching the film. The conflict established is more or less a circumstance of reactionary response to the disobedience of order; order which is constantly affirmed throughout the entire first chapter of the film.Then there's the scene in the second chapter where the passengers aboard Potemkin begin to rebel. Eisenstein utilizes his montage theory to establish the events occurring before zeroing in on specific people fighting and specific blows in a way that shows the conflict between the two parties whilst showing a more concise focus on a large-scale playing field. The effect is unique because it's rare we see a large battle (or even a large battle conducted in a small area) specified so humanly by way of close-ups and intimate shooting techniques that Eisenstein employs that make the sequence so personal.As far as alternative logic goes – where Eisenstein creates some sort of visual poetry or distinction without the use of his beloved montage technique – there's the scene early in the film where one of the captains goes to observe the actions in the bunkers. Eisenstein's camera observes the actions of the captain while interjecting cuts of pots and pans precariously placed atop boards of wood that are strung up and suspended to the room's ceiling. These scenes establish what the captain is looking at and what his environment is composed of in a manner that relates greatly to Kulesov and his own personal effect.Then there are scenes that are more concerned with fleshing out a specific event, rather than encapsulating the horror and the messiness of other events (the uprising aboard the Potemkin and the famous Odessa Steps sequence just to name a few). One scene is the final straw for the workers, of sorts, when they are persuaded to believe that rotting, maggot-ridden meat is okay for consumption, despite being viewed by everybody on board, even the cooks, as otherwise. Eisenstein keeps things grounded more-or-less in a real-time here, allowing his camera to go back and forth between the workers and the captains in a manner that doesn't shortchange or rapidly look for a way out of this event in order to interject other scenes and create a compilation of 'last straws' for the workers. This scene in particular establishes the logic that Eisenstein uses can be equal parts broadly observant, as seen in his montages, or decidedly focused.In a way, I feel Battleship Potemkin was a film made for the masses to, for once, look introspectively at their situations in Russian and observe the treacherous, unfair living conditions and the willfully oppressive nature of the rich and able. Eisenstein had to combat the fact that most of the commonwealth Russian population was illiterate and unknowing of their own exploitation, which made him make a film like this that, despite being able to be dissected in numerous ways, almost demands a response of any kind. The complete and total disregard for the health and wellbeing of humans should at least warrant some response from people, and Eisenstein's images reflect the horrors of oppression without getting lost in symbolism or any kind of discernible auteurism. His montage elements only add to a film, rather than being stylistic distractions that work to muddle the themes at hand.Starring: Aleksandr Antonov, Vladimir Barksy, and Grigori Aleksandrov. Directed by: Sergei Eisenstein.",9,0,0,12 October 2015
Elf," A rarity for the holidays and for Ferrell
","Elf has the premise and the look of a badly made Christmas special made solely for network TV. Going into this with mediocre expectations, it only took about ten minutes of seeing Will Ferrell in an elf costume to know that my predictions were dreadfully wrong. This wasn't a case of holiday dreck, but a case of the Christmas film that combined heart, soul, wit, and laughs into a beautiful holiday parable.The story is about Buddy the Elf (Ferrell) who accidentally crawled into Santa's sack at the orphanage when he was an infant and gets taken back to the North Pole. Santa Claus and the elves choose to raise him and train him to become an elf. Buddy is of course a human so he grows a lot faster than the average elf. In fact, he towers over every other elf he works with, and this leads to problems when he is older.Buddy then learns he is a human, which causes confusion and sadness. It is told that he was placed in that orphanage as an infant because his father fell in love with a woman who gave birth to him then gave him up unbeknownst to him. Buddy then decides he will go to New York City to try and find his dad and reconnect with him.His goal is to also spread Christmas cheer far and wide because Santa's sleigh is almost forced to operate with an engine. In the olden days, Santa's sleigh could fly because of mass amounts of Christmas spirit and children believing in Santa Claus. Now, he has to resort to heavy machinery to do that job.Will Ferrell hasn't sat right with me for the longest time, but as I see more of his movies I begin to like the guy in a sense where I'd like to see him do one of two movies; (a) heartfelt children's' films or (2) very serious dramas in the vein of his 2011 film Everything Must Go. He doesn't have the talents to pull off incredibly funny slapstick because his schtick is usually composed of running around like a towering dork or just screaming. Elf shows his ability to incorporate his persona in a character you can't help but love.We also see Zooey Deschannel, one of my favorite females in the business today, as Jovie, a woman who works at a mall as Santa's little helpers. Buddy falls for Jovie in a sort of non-conventional way, but he winds up getting conventional help from his younger brother Michael (Tay).Elf is more than holiday fluff, it's a successful romp of Christmas spirit sealed inside a good family film. The cast is lively, the antics aren't over the top, and the storyline unique and film sustainable. This also shows immensely that director Jon Favreau can be handed a script for a thriller, a comedy, a romantic comedy, a superhero film, or a drama and still be able to create on screen magic. I'm also sure this beats a movie about elves working in a tree during the dry season.Starring: Will Ferrell, James Cann, Zooey Deschannel, and Daniel Tay. Directed by: Jon Favreau.",8,2,2,18 December 2011
Taxi Driver," Does for the people what he can't do for himself
","Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver bleeds with style and substance, and features Robert De Niro in, quite possibly, his best performance. He immerses himself in the role of Travis Bickle, an honorably discharged Vietnam Marine who is an extreme loner, basking in his sorrow, despair, and utterly melancholy woe. He gets a job as a night time cab driver that will hopefully control his insomnia, and maybe give him a purpose in life. He claims early on that while other cabbies refuse to pick up some people, like prostitutes and blacks, he doesn't care who you are. He'll get you where you want to be. If only he could do the same for himself.Early on, Bickle falls in lust with a political campaign volunteer named Betsy (Shepherd), he has been closely watching, but not stalking. He sees Betsy is crying out for purpose and love, and doesn't feel comfortable behind a desk on the phone every day, supporting some politician who probably wouldn't do the same for her. On top of vaguely balancing a respectable relationship, near the end of the film, he tries to save Iris, played by a very young Jodie Foster, a teenager involved in explicit prostitution, treated like meat by her despicable pimp and the rest of society.To me, Taxi Driver plays like an earlier version of the underrated Michael Douglas film Falling Down. Both films involve heartbroken loners, not only contemplating their purpose in society, but are also disgusted with the arrogance and mean-spirit that plagues the world. The blatant carelessness of the well being of other people. Both De Niro and Douglas give career worthy performances, but Douglas played more of a character going over the edge, while De Niro's character strives more on subtleties.There has been a looming debate on the film to whether or not the character of Travis Bickle is good or evil. This debate can go on for hours, because the film provides enough evidence for both sides of the argument. One could say Travis is good because he eventually sees society as a corrupt, evil place that acts on impulse and favors arrogance over honesty, and decides to take action, and one could say that Travis is an evil character because he ignores countless instances in the world and commits crime by eliminating it. I believe he is a good protagonist, with some flaws, just like many human beings. Either way, he makes for a very interesting and intriguing character in a film.Let's talk about the smaller additions that make the film into the work of art it is. For one, the writing, by Paul Schrader who would later work with Director Martin Scorsese on The Last Temptation of Christ and Raging Bull. Schrader's polished and commendable writing is not only sly on the themes, but definitely makes the film warrant multiple viewings. Just by seeing it once, I can tell it probably won't be my last. It seems Taxi Driver has layers that will gradually be peeled off one by one with each of the following viewings, and I can see this evolving into a film that seemed pretty upfront upon the first viewing but becoming more complex later on.The cinematography is award-worthy. Who would've thought Scorsese's next step would be a black and white film? The colors are vibrant, as well as the atmosphere, being very seamy, expressive, but also very ominous and eerie, especially in the night shots. Some scenes even allow us to experience them in detail with classical music nicely placed in the background. Some actually take place in Bickle's cab as we cruise down the street and are met with shots of the sidewalks, evoking prostitutes, pimps, and street-walkers all with a sort of sympathy and vague understanding of their hardships. It seems Scorsese wanted to breed life into those that seem like they have none, and that's where the picture comes off as wonderful. At the time, we were rarely shown the lower-end of the food chain, and now, there is a film resting on that end, wishing it would be in a higher, more respectable position, but continues to find that wish elusive and imaginary.Am I still coherently here, or have I lost you? Let's just end this way; Taxi Driver is a fantastic blend of urban isolation and alienation and is successful at providing humanistic characteristics to those who seemingly are void of any. The film is beautifully located even in its seamiest moments, elegantly written, and carefully directed, as Scorsese breaks new ground with this dark, very deep psychological thriller that may have you resorting to something happier afterwards. The man does it again.Starring: Robert De Niro, Cybill Shepherd, Albert Brooks, and Harvey Keitel. Directed by: Martin Scorsese.",10,1,1,3 April 2012
Shutter Island," An Island Not Meant for Vacations
","Leo never stood out to me as a great actor. Before it hits the fans, I always thought his movies were lengthy and overrated. Though I decided from the trailers and reviews from this film, that it would be different and more of a complex physcological thriller. It definitely is. This is a very confusing film, with that being so various twists and turns come about and it's hard to give a legitimate answer for a plot. I will make it as simplistic as possible and try to go more in-depth with my opinion to expand this review.Two Federal Marshalls, Teddy Daniels (Leo) and his partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo), go to the Ashecliff Hospital for the criminally insane on the remote Shutter Island. They try to investigate and piece together the mystery of what happened in the disappearance of Rachel Solando (Emily Mortimer). With her being in a locked room it's as if she evaporated through the walls.The head psychiatrist, Dr. John Cawley (Ben Kingsley) harasses the Marshall's and plays mind games on the two as well, being a major pain. While continuous twists and turns overwrite the movie, the film has no holes and really leads up to the suspense moments. The film's tone is very dark and creepy just like the book it represents.Many would say that this movie is too confusing, rightfully it is, but still, when followed with a third eye you can see more twists unfold by the second. Every little detail builds and adds to the resolution at the end. I will definitely re-watch it to see if I could point out more curves I may have missed in my first viewing of the film done back in February.Another thing that made this film great was the excellent charisma and bonding relationship between Martin Scorsese and Leonardo Di-Caprio. They worked previously on the 2006 Academy Award show stealer The Departed so no doubt that they no what they are doing together. All in all, Shutter Island is an absolute blast of Suspenseful action combined with the excellence of true beauty in film-making. An early candidate for the best film of 2010.Starring: Leonardo Di-Caprio, Ben Kingsley, Mark Ruffalo, and Michelle Williams. Directed by: Martin Scorsese.",10,1,5,4 July 2010
Life of Pi," 'This is a picture of sheer power and beauty'
","Life of Pi is one of the most marvelous theater experiences I've had all year. Its Oscar for art direction and cinematography should already be locked in. It's a film of incorruptible beauty and deeply satisfying drama which squeezes so much power and emotion out of its audience that they leave feeling riveted at the same time drained. You can bet the film's main character feels the exact same way.Our main character is an adult named Piscine Molitor, who goes by the name 'Pi Patel,' and we meet him as an adult (played by Irrfan Khan) who begins telling his long life-story to a writer planning to adapt it (Rafe Spall). It's a story that tested him as a person in every possible way, and it all goes back to when his parents made the decision to move from India to Canada, and because Pi's father was a zookeeper, take many animals such as orangutans, zebras, goats, and tigers with them on an enormous ship across the Pacific Ocean. Before this move, Pi was an optimistic soul, who ventured out as a young boy beyond his comfort zone in his Hindu religion to seek out other walks of faith, specifically Christianity and Islam, which he began following all at once.During the move, a wild, violent storm hits the ocean, flooding the ship and sending Pi, a zebra with a broken leg, a hyena, an orangutan, and a tiger named 'Richard Parker' on a lifeboat, leaving behind the several other animals and Pi's entirely family. This whole sequence, which lasts around five minutes, feels like the entire movie The Perfect Storm shortened from its original two-hour length, only it emphasizes the emotional elements. This is one of the saddest scenes of the year, as we see a teenage Pi (now played by Suraj Sharma) desperately hold onto the lifeboat for dear-life, while being washed away from his mother, father, and siblings and there is absolutely nothing he can do about it. Between you and I, reader, this is one of the most emotionally upsetting scenes (this and the ending of the film) I've ever sat through in a theater.Now, Pi is stranded in the middle of the Pacific, with an open sky, four different animals, until they are picked off with only the tiger remaining, and his own will to live. The remainder of the film forgoes the back-and-forth narrative between adult Pi telling the story to the writer, but remains focused on his own recollection of events on that lifeboat and the acts of bravery he committed to keep him and the tiger alive. While Pi and Richard Parker are sharing the boat, that does not mean they get along. Writer David Magee makes no mistake in illustrating that while they are stranded together, Pi is a human boy and Richard Parker is a Bengal tiger. The beauty of this picture is that it never mistakes that the only common traits between these two souls is that they are stranded together and both are mammals.Life of Pi's visuals are astounding. Long shots that hold on the vast emptiness of the Pacific are invigorating because of their wide range of beauty and clarity, sequences of peril and uncertainty are captured through an equally clear, vivid lens, making them all the more real and enthralling, and atmospherically, the picture shows the dangers and the loneliness of the ocean better than any film I have yet to see.Thematically, the picture focuses on predominately on the idea of survival and spirituality, which gratefully helps Pi keep hope and optimism during these gruelingly unforgiving days. One of the most intense and poignant scenes comes when Pi is faced with the task of killing a large fish. He is starving, and becoming skinnier by the day, so he fiercely grabs a fish out of the water and begins hacking at it with a small axe. When the fish is bloody and long dead, he begins to sob tears of joy and sadness; joy because he finally has a decent portion of food, yet sadness in the idea that he has killed a living creature and is about to abandon his vegetarian vow. It's a scene that, once more, clouded my eyes with tears, just like Pi's, of joy and sadness. This is a picture of sheer power and beauty. A film that clearly tests its lead actor, Sharma, who is inhabiting his first main role, and a film that will hopefully go on to live with a reputation of one of cinema's supreme achievements. It must be said that in Ang Lee's twenty year film career that he has tackled almost every genre in the medium and done so with an extraordinary amount of confidence. His directorial efforts too have not been minor additions to the genre, but true game-changers if anything. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was a martial arts film filled with depth and delight. Hulk was a superhero movie that added so much weight to its characters and relationships, you'd think Christopher Nolan's modern-day Dark Knight franchise was taking notes from it. And Brokeback Mountain was, for the most part, a lively portrayal of two men who've kept their orientation silent for so long that they begin to embrace it by meeting each other out of the blue. Life of Pi offers more of the same grandiose ideas from the brilliant visionaire and its shocking smoothness in terms of filming, placement, and writing is beyond fabulous and wildly consuming because of its clarity. This is one of the best films of the year, and on-par with the depth and cinematography in Samsara, making this year one of the most beautiful.",10,60,90,22 November 2012
Lost in Translation," The equivalent of cinematic fishing - once you're hooked, the film isn't letting you go
","Lost in Translation details the kind of wayward search for human connection many of us go through in life, sometimes young, sometimes old, or following a traumatic event. It's the time in our lives when we feel the most lost, and truthfully, many of us don't want answers as to how to better our situation, but just want somebody to go along for the ride. We'd like to find someone to empathize with, embrace on a frequent basis, and know that somebody cares about us and our wayward ways and to reciprocate such feelings.With this, Sofia Coppola writes and directs a film about that search for human connection and what it can exactly amount to. We are immediately introduced to Bob Harris (Bill Murray), an older American movie star who travels to Tokyo to film an advertisement for Suntory whiskey. Bob has found himself in the mix of a souring marriage and no real close friends, and it is in Tokyo where Bob sinks deeper and deeper into a midlife crisis. Meanwhile, we also meet Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), a college graduate whose husband John (Giovanni Ribisi) is starting to lose interest in her in favor of all the models he works with.Later on, Bob and Charlotte finally meet and immediately recognize each others unfortunate situation. They spend sporadic amounts of time together, often not talking and simply speaking in fragmented sentences and lying next to one another. They aren't very concerned with long conversation; they simply let their lethargy in their current situations carry their relationship along.Over time, sexual tension between the two builds, though both of them are still caught in relationships, regardless of how mediocre they are. In addition, neither of them are quite sure how to conjure intimacy with one another. The two are much more in tune with being static beings and platonic. This is one of the few dramas I can recall that allows the presence of the characters to take over rather than their actions. Coppola sits back and watches with a keen eye and a sense of mannered restraint how Bob and Charlotte get close over the course of their visit in Tokyo.Coppola's interest lies in Bob and Charlotte's situation moreso than the progression of their relationship, which is a difficult thing to pull off in film without working with more of an impressionistic style. The brushstrokes Coppola paints this story in are more or less minimal, but they craft just enough out of a little so that we can recognize these characters, their feelings, and their current state. They have transcended living life into simply existing within it, rarely getting excited and scarcely finding any kind of mutual contentment.Again, in these situations, all you need is another soul who feels the same way you do, and in this case, that's bottled up angst and complete and total uncertainty. The title represents a lot of things and the cultural gap Bob and Charlotte experience is only a small part of it; these two souls are lost within the translation of life. Life has keep going and two formerly active people who could keep up with the bustle have let it all pass by, letting sadness dominate their lives and fogginess encapsulate the remnants of the future. The translation lost is within the characters here, and that's sometimes scarier than not speaking the same language of the community.The only issue that arises from this is that we get the impression that Coppola either doesn't understand Japanese culture or simply doesn't want to, what with the abundance of cheap stereotypes and archetypal Japanese characters played for nothing but laughs here. Coppola opens by ostensibly getting most out of her way, thankfully, however, through the use of subtle humor, but sporadically doubles back to throw in another jab or two, which can briefly throw the film out of whack. It reminds me of when a really artsy film wants to try and pander and connect with the audience when it thinks it has lot them, and, as shown here amidst others, the action has the opposite effect.However, Murray and Johansson craft wonderful, low-key chemistry here. Murray's subtle sarcasm and overall cynicism are downplayed but in force here, as he employs facial expressions that speak louder than words could. He fully shows how he can be a hilarious comic presence and a fascinating, real dramatic presence and merge the two in one project, proving nothing but great range and ability on his behalf. Johansson, who was only eighteen during the time this was being filmed, bears mannerisms and a self-assured aura that would be more expected from someone ten years older than her. Such lofty material is presented and she handles the task of not being too theatrical or obvious very well, and it's a performance that requires both actors to place a reliance on their body language and facial expressions. This was by no means an easy role for Johansson, yet she breaks out with it and becomes a force all her own.Lost in Translation details a difficult time in a person's life and, in the process, doesn't sugarcoat it. The lack of human connection and the feelings of hopelessness, regardless of short-term or long-term, are debilitating to a person, and this film goes on to show to reiterate my idea about life: if we didn't have at least one of these things - a passion, a good relationship with family, or close friends and people to connect with - we would jump out a window.Starring: Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson, Giovanna Ribisi, and Anna Faris. Directed by: Sofia Coppola.",8,16,20,29 April 2015
Interstellar," Embodies the reason why many of us venture to the cinema
","Christopher Nolan's 'Interstellar' combines two of the most basic principles of science-fiction stories, simultaneously being tense and immersing, but also manages to be somewhat perplexing in its manipulation of space and time. In that simple respect, the film is nearly a wash, but thanks to Nolan's desire to constantly challenge and experiment with how far the realms of science-fiction filmmaking can go, he manages to concoct another crafty and commendable film that effectively compliments his decorated filmography.Coming off of his acclaimed 'Batman' trilogy, and his beloved mindbender 'Inception,' Nolan further explores the concept of time manipulation with 'Interstellar.' Set in the near future, we are greeted with an ugly America, reliant on agriculture and burdened by prolific and crippling dust storms that make life, human and agricultural, incredibly difficult and almost impossible. We focus on the family of a widowed-man named Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), who lives in a ramshackle farm with his father-in-law Donald (John Lithgow), his teenage son Tom, and his ten-year-old daughter Murphy. Cooper, a man with a passion for science and engineering, discovers moving books on his book shelf that are ostensibly the work of a paranormal entity. After dust is seen rising from his floor and spells out a message of a secret NASA institution, Cooper realizes it is a route of communication from an undetermined world or dimensional.Cooper arrives at the secret NASA institution, led by one of his old professors (Michael Caine), who informs him that a wormhole has been discovered in the solar system and exists near Saturn. He states that a team of astronauts need to go into space and venture through the wormhole in order to explore new galaxies and potentially find a new place for humans to call home. Now that Cooper has seen this institution, there's no turning back, and he must embark on an intergalactic mission with numerous others, leaving his family behind for an unknown amount of time. Being that many of these galaxies exist in the realm of time that moves either progressively faster or slower than what we've come to know, spending an hour in one particular location could warrant seven years have slipped by back on Earth.Before we go any further, 'Interstellar,' seems to be a modern reimagining or homage to Stanley Kubrick's classic '2001: A Space Odyssey.' Cooper meets a unique looking robot by the name of TARS soon after he embarks on the mission, who doesn't look or operate anything like the conventional, humanoid robots we've come to imagine and sounds very similar to the computer system HAL from the aforementioned film. In addition, interactions with relatives who Cooper hasn't seen in years, the exploration of different galaxies, the impending commentary on scientific advancement and how far we've come, and even the adventure through the wormhole that reminds one of the scene in the classic film where the ship travels through the hyperspace all remind of '2001: A Space Odyssey.' With that, it's almost as if Nolan wanted to bring about an entirely more scientific angle to the story rather than one predicated on metaphors and interpretations.For that reason, expecting 'Interstellar' to be entirely original and unforeseen is foolish mainly because basic elements of the story seem to have been stripped from '2001' in such a way that renders them, not as lesser, but familiar. However, make no mistake in recognizing the true beauty that the film manages to summon almost on command. 'Interstellar' is a gorgeous film, with Oscar-worthy special effects that find themselves immersing the viewer in different worlds and different places that are only limited by the imagination of the Nolan brothers, Christopher and Jonathan, and the impeccably-talented special effects artists who brought them to life. One of the basic principles of filmmaking is achieved here as Nolan and a devoted crew of special effects artist effectively transport us to different galaxies and cater to our unquenchable thirst for visions of the universe.At the center of all of this is McConaughey, who I'm not afraid to call my favorite leading male actor working today, along the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Affleck, Robert Downey, Jr., and Channing Tatum. McConaughey has effectively transformed himself into an actor of range and impeccable talent, with 'Interstellar' being his most emotional project yet. McConaughey exhausts himself by circling all the emotional bases this particular story can offer, working best when his character is forced to watch his kids grow twenty-three years older in five minutes, creating the saddest scene in the whole film. It's the kind of performance where you almost feel that the Academy cannot wait to announce his name as one of the nominees for Best Actor.'Interstellar''s crowning achievement, besides its special effects work, is its human-centeredness, keeping the human characters in mind every step of the project. Even with grandiose ideas about existence and time etched into the screenplay, Nolan never loses sight of believable human drama and the real heartbreak in seeing your children age from, literally, another galaxy. 'Interstellar,' even in a state that feels like an homage crossed with an extremely-ambitious tale of space and time, is a film that caters to the basic idea of why we go to the movies as a medium of entertainment.",8,1,3,10 November 2014
American Sniper," When the character can't overcome the legend
","Clint Eastwood's 'American Sniper' put me in the same kind of mood 'Lone Survivor' did this time last year, in that I was reflective of why so many Americans, myself included, rush out to the multiplex to see a new war movie. The answer, from what I gather, is fairly simple, in that most Americans have very little conception as to what occurs overseas, and that mediums like books and films are our windows to the frontlines of combat. With war films based off true events, factual accuracy is always debatable, and the persistent fact checking often circles itself enough to the point where you don't know what to believe; nonetheless, if the combat and the human stories are done correctly, along with the presence of a clean structure, you will feel a war film and that's just about as good as anything.'American Sniper' is destined to be the audience favorite of the next few weeks, and to be fair, it's easy to identify why; if you're someone who hasn't seen a lot of war films, or even if you have, this particular film packs a serious punch. A lot occurs in a little over two hours, and images and sequences many won't be used to will likely upset viewers and provoke feelings and attitudes that aren't usually provoked, even when watching a war film. At the end of my showing, over eighty people walked out in stone-cold silence; it was one of the most somber and telling signs I've ever witnessed exiting a movie theater. Everyone, regardless of their opinions, had just witnessed something that had them at a loss for words or an inability to speak their opinions as the credits rolled.The film tells the story of the deadliest sniper in United States history, a Texas native by the name of Chris Kyle (played by Bradley Cooper), who enlisted in the Navy SEALS following the 1998 bombings of the United States embassies. He was eventually drafted into the Iraq War following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and went on to earn the name 'Legend,' for his prolific body count and his persistent loyalty to his squadmates. However, back home, as one would expect, his Taya (Sienna Miller) feels his absence, struggling to raise children and maintain their home, especially when every time Chris returns home, he is burdened by nudging thoughts of discomfort and an inability to readjust, which makes him want to return to the frontlines.The film keeps one foot in Iraq and the other back in Texas, showing the contrasting lifestyles and the effects each one has on Kyle has a person. Iraq has him in a mood that is constantly alive, working to protect and operate as cleanly as possible, where back home shows him burdened by the thoughts of his current disloyalty and his persistent thoughts of war, as he clearly starts to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. A great scene in particular has Kyle staring at a Television set during a party, with thunderous explosions, helicopters, and combat being heard at deafening levels, leading one to believe he's watching coverage of the Iraq War; a brief pan around to show us his point-of-view shows the television set is turned off.Eastwood keeps 'American Sniper' grounded in humanity when it comes to showing the scenes involving the after-effects of each of Kyle's four tours in Iraq, but neglects to develop him as a person. A critical structural flaw in the film occurs within the first half hour, where the scene from the teaser trailer - showing Kyle with his crosshairs on a suspicious woman and her child as they harbor a grenade towards U.S. soldiers - remains a teaser in the feature film, with Eastwood cutting away from the action as it's about to unfold to show Kyle's life as a child before returning back to said scene to witness the outcome. During the time where Eastwood and writer Jason Hall expands on Kyle's upbringing and eventually enlisting, significant father/son moments and true motivations are simplified, resulting in a rushed treatment of the founding years of the character's life. On top of that, Eastwood corrupts the suspense he conjured from the trailer of the film by interrupting such a tense scene in the feature film, taking us out of an environment and interjecting us into several others when he should've kept us grounded in one.Furthermore, the character of Chris Kyle remains largely a vapid caricature, characterized only by such buzzwords as 'legend' or 'amazing,' never giving us the tender, more human side to the man that the film has initially suggested. What we largely get are combat scenes that are sometimes gripping and other times spatially incoherent or certain scenes that lack emotional leverage because they spell things out through the use of dialog or obviousness (IE: Kyle's face staring into the television as he witnesses one of the World Trade Center towers collapsing into rubble). While Cooper may be giving us one of the strongest performances of his career, effectively achieving the combination of unsettled and fragile, Hall's writing greatly shortchanges Sienna Miller's character, who is resorted to nothing more than being a wife who constantly calls her husband in either frustration or sadness and doesn't become her own central identity.Nonetheless, there's a real overload of content here in terms of how much the film shows and how deep it's willing to go in certain situations. Eastwood and Hall do their best not to leave a stone unturned, and Cooper follows along nicely, creating a character who can be fearless at times and unsure and self-critical at others. 'American Sniper' will please a great deal of audiences, but serious issues with the film's structure and depiction of its titular character should not go unnoticed despite the film's ability to captivate and illicit emotions.",6,5,20,19 January 2015
Corpse Bride," The deader the better
","In a world where so many animated films are effortlessly vibrant and soaked with bright candy colors, Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is a dark, yet rarely dreary exercise, with dark subject matter taken in a harmless and fun form. The story is cute, the voice acting has a fine elegance to it, and the mischief and cinematography is delightfully cinematic.Any expectations of frightening sequences or nightmare-inducing scenes can be safely discarded upon arrival. While the film is sometimes dark, it is never haunting or indelibly scaring and, I firmly believe, the more films you've seen the more inclined you are to enjoy it. I recall references some early twenties and thirties films and including one famous line uttered from one very famous film.The story revolves around the shy and clumsy Victor Van Dort (voiced by Johnny Depp), who is preparing for his arranged marriage with Victoria Everglot (Watson) in a Victorian Era Europe. The Van Dorts are a wealthy family, while the Everglots don't have a dime to their name, and marriage will hopefully buy them a better spot on the social class level. When Victor ruins the potential wedding, he is sent off to better prepare himself where he practices his vows in the woods, placing his ring on a curled stick only to have it come alive as the 'Corpse Bride.' The bride is voiced by Helena Bonham Carter, in a beautifully fitting role, as she believes Victor sincerely meant to marry her. Things become conflicted, but thankfully, never resemble a shouting match like an episode of Maury.The stop-motion animation is absolutely wonderful. An artful and divine masterpiece. Characters are created in true Tim Burton fashion; tall and lanky, as if their arms are black-coated toothpicks and their heads small mounds of clay with a touch of fantasy. What is even more amazing is what Burton can do with such tiny characters. There is a scene early in the film where Victor plays a lovely song on the piano, as Emily waltzes down the stairs quietly so as not to disturb him. The scene is complimented by utter silence and simplicity, not to mention beautifully crafted romance before the subjects even meet each other. Not to mention, Danny Elfman's score, like always, is ravishing and perfectly concatenates the vibrant experience that is awaiting the viewer.At a mere seventy-three minutes without credits, Corpse Bride has the look and feel of a potential Television program for the unique viewer. It races past, and with a basic yet imaginative idea, its possibilities never feel gridlocked to the ordinary. It's hard to believe it took four writers (one of them the late Pixar voice actor Joe Ranft) to write such a concise work for the eyes and the mind. If there's one petty complaint, it's that even at a slender seventy-three minutes the film starts to become much of a muchness and the drab look does wear on the eyes. What could've been a tedious exercise is still worked fittingly into a stop-motion film from a director that has proved in the past he can deliver a brilliant one.Voiced by: Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Emily Watson, Tracey Ullman, Paul Whitehouse, Joanna Lumley, and Albert Finney. Directed by: Tim Burton.",8,0,0,14 May 2012
Romeo + Juliet," Where for art thou, entertainment?
","Romeo + Juliet is a failed attempt to modernize Shakespeare's classic play written all the way back in 1591. Its glossy production, awkward mix of old and new, and newer technology added to give it the 'present' feel completely destroys the love aspect of the film and turns it into a goofy and lame adaptation of one of literature's many classics.Obviously, this was meant for kids who don't like reading, but like action films. The scenes are loaded with primary colors and the action rarely ceases. The acting is beyond over-dramatic, and turns the characters into buffoons who barely represent their respected characters in the play.The nail that seals the coffin is the film's mix of the old and the new style. It can't decide if it wants to fully change Shakespeare's work, or keep some in and some out. We get a messy result. The film hybrids over using pistols instead of swords and car chases to entertain ones who believe the play is 'boring.' To cover up the madness and chaos exploding on screen we get annoying and volume enhanced rock tunes that are out of place and just a complete and total waste of time. I would have never thought Radiohead would've made it in a film titled Romeo + Juliet.The storyline is kept pretty much the same; Romeo and Juliet are star-crossed lovers who desperately want to be together. Romeo coming from the Montague household and Juliet from the Capulets, have known that their parents have had an ongoing rivalry forever but can't help but find solace in each other.Despite its age and overall outdated language, Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet has managed to leach itself into the school curriculum year after year. The book is in no way a bad read. I found some parts hard to understand, but I was caught up within a few minutes. It does involve re-reading and your full attention.The book is very outdated in terms of dialog. Obviously, no body says 'Where for art thou, mother' in 2011. The most important aspect of a book is being able to read it and comprehend what it is telling you. Sometimes, that can be a task for current readers of the play. But with internet and technology at its peak I'm sure understanding it will be no problem.I'm in no way bashing the book. I found it to be quite enjoyable and quite sad, but sometimes I kind of wish I knew what was happening instead of assuming. Still, the play is the grand-daddy of literature. I can except that, and I'm glad I read it.With actors like Leonardo DiCaprio, Claire Danes, and John Leguizamo I can only imagine how this film would've played out if it was made with some level of seriousness. It has been so long since we saw a new R&J adaptation, you'd think one would be remade again to fill the void.What really kills this film, is the dialog. It keeps in place lots of Shakespeare speak. It is not only laughable, but questionable. First you want to completely modernize the film, then you want to keep the dialog. Maybe in someone's head it sounds pretty amusing, on film, it is atrocious and unable to take seriously. Especially when the film pans shots of some unnamed fat guy sitting on a lawnchair with no shirt on. Seriously? Romeo + Juliet is definitely a unique adaptation, but it is absolutely a horrendous turnout. Anyone in school watching this will likely be amused by its quirky take on the play and find it way more entertaining than the play itself because of its more blatant style. Shakespeare fans will be greatly letdown by the film's mockery of the play's tragedy. It is definitely a stain on Leo's filmography, and the rest of the cast's.Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Claire Danes, John Leguizamo, Harold Perrineau, Pete Postlethwaite, Brian Dennehy, Paul Rudd, Christina Pickles, and Jesse Bradford.

Forrest Gump," Forgive me for not seeing 'the greatest film ever.' I'm fourteen.
","Ever have that one film that you've been getting bothered to watch, and just because you haven't seen it people feel the need to hate you and bash you? Or maybe it's just me. Forrest Gump has been neglected by me for years on end. Sadly, I can not give a reason strong enough for people to understand. It's something only I understand.My reason is that sometimes I get so sick and tired of hearing so much about one film I just blow it off and pick around the edges. It gets annoying to hear the same thing being spoken over and over again, and when I say some of my favorite films are Clerks, Tremors, License to Drive, Joy Ride, and Bio-Dome people, the ones that have heard of the above, say I have a very eclectic taste in film. That I do. But when people started verbally insulting me saying 'I'm not a real critic' and 'You can't call yourself a critic if you haven't seen the masterpiece that is Forrest Gump, I finally just said 'OK! I'll watch it!' The plot I won't waste time repeating. Aside from me till this day EVERYONE knows the plot of Forrest Gump. So why repeat it? A simpleton with an IQ of 75 (Hanks) describes his life in an autobiographical form to strangers while waiting for a bus. Can't get more simplistic than that.Forrest Gump has been called by people 'a masterpiece' and 'a classic.' While I think it's a well made film, I don't think it deserved six Oscars. I also don't think I should be ridiculed and slapped in the face for not seeing this film. It wasn't truly amazing. In fact, no film is really 'amazing.' Even the favorite film I don't call amazing. When defining 'amazing' you'll find it's definition is 'surprising greatly.' I've seen actors, directors, people, teachers, etc do an 'amazing' job teaching. The film I'm waiting to define 'amazing' has not been found.The Oscars Gump won were Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor, Best Director, Best Effects, and Best Film Editing. It deserved Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor, Best Director, and Best Editing. That's about it. Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction, Four Weddings and a Funeral, The Shawshank Redemption, Quiz Show were all nominated for Best Picture in the year 1994. I can tell you right now I liked Shawshank better than Gump.As for the rest, Director Robert Zemeckis did a great job adapting the story onto film. Tom Hanks is rightfully the only person who could play Forrest with true affection. I respect that. Hanks is now attached to so many things like Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code I think 'Will he ever make a film worth seeing again?' One category Forrest Gump should've won for is 'Best Musical Score.' The film includes the catchiest, most enjoyable score I can remember in a film. It's definitely on my list of faves (and my iPod for that matter). I found myself jamming out to the tunes in this movie. Especially Lynyrd Skynyrd's iconic 'Free Bird' which was used to perfection in this film.Forrest Gump, the character, is very likable because of his mild mannered and innocent ways. I enjoyed the scenes of him in the army, and the scenes of him at the end. He is definitely a very memorable character. Not an amazing character.My final thoughts on 'the greatest movie ever' go as followed; it was a damn fine film with very memorable moments, but is NOT the greatest film to ever be filmed, put in theaters, thrown in a case, set on the shelves. I somehow feel if I was not pressured and annoyed to review this film I would've enjoyed it more. Maybe if people didn't annoy me so much to review it I would've enjoyed more of what it had to offer. The damage is done. I bet even after I'm done with this review people will say I didn't do it appropriate justice. I got two words to say for them; s**t happens.Starring: Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson, and Sally Field. Directed by: Robert Zemeckis.",9,4,6,28 February 2011
The Passion of Joan of Arc," A film so heartbreakingly realistic and brutally honest it might even bring tears to your eyes
","Part of what makes The Passion of Joan of Arc so bold and unflinching, for its time and its current state in cinema, is, much like its titular subject, how battered, beaten, and kicked around it has been in order to get where it is today. This is a film that, from its very inception, was a controversial subject that clerical authorities didn't want to be seen by a wide audience, for its portrayal of religion and politics. Nonetheless, writer/director Carl Theodor Dreyer pushed forward in a direction for a film on Joan of Arc that detailed the gap between religion and politics, in addition to insights into the complex of the fragile male ego that boasts assimilation and manipulation. After the completed and finalized print was lost in a fire, it was doubtful that a print even close to the original would ever resurface until one was discovered in a mental institution in Oslo, Norway in the 1980's. After some cleaning up and polish was added, the film was restored into an eighty-one minute cut, which is said to be very close to the original film's length and structure.Dreyer's focus in The Passion of Joan of Arc was precisely what the title suggests; an intimate and often harrowing portrayal of the agony the French heroine (played ever-so tenderly by Renée Jeanne Falconetti) endured following her unfair trial after the Hundred Years' War. Dreyer sees no point or purpose in showcasing sweeping battle sequences nor does he see it fit to detail Joan of Arc's story in a series of 'greatest hits' moments that ultimately ends in a corrupt sentencing. Instead, Dreyer places us, the audience, in an awkward position throughout; we are practically voyeurs into the trial and sentencing of Joan of Arc, who we witness subjected to enough physical and mental torment to shatter one's entire self-worth. As she takes a stand for her faith and her beliefs of her own personal sainthood and relationship with God, she is bludgeoned and abused by an all-male jury and various authorities before being sentenced to death by being consumed by fire.The Passion of Joan of Arc can be viewed in two basic forms; in its original form, with no dialog, or a modified, Criterion Collection version that adds accompanying orchestration from Richard Einhorn called 'Voices of Light' (which was my audio-track companion) throughout the film. Einhorn's score provides well-timed parallels in sound and musicality to events transpired on-screen, and the symphonic blend of instruments at various times adds to the cacophony of emotions and tones throughout the picture in a way that wouldn't be as impacting, I feel, with an empty audio-track. Dreyer's film has far too much potential for impact to be viewed in complete and utter silence.Dreyer's decision to focus largely on facial expressions and the facial personalities of characters almost overshadows the complex work of his and Rudolph Maté's in the cinematography department. At the time of its release, The Passion of Joan of Arc erected one of the most expensive and immaculately detailed film sets in the history of cinema, with its construction of the famous Rouen Castle taking most of Dreyer's seven million franc budget on the film. Having said that, the detail in the background of the film is almost as important as the detail in the foreground, with hulking walls and set architecture towering over the characters in the film like a bitter and obvious presence. The walls are nothing more than helpless witnesses to the atrocious treatment of a very confident woman; so confident she makes her male counterparts squirm with inferiority and fear.Out of eighty-one minutes, probably a good forty or forty-five are Dreyer's camera lingering and depicting the facial and emotional reactions of Joan of Arc. Dreyer allows us to zero in on Joan of Arc's emotional responses as a way of peeling back the events of this film and revealing a tender, more human side that can often get lost in the shuffle. This is also likely why Dreyer forgoes the conventional battle sequences the Hundred Years' War practically loans itself to on film; it doesn't work to detail the kind of grounded human interest in the film.Finally, there's the concept of male ego that Dreyer subtly explores here. Consider how manipulated Joan of Arc becomes shortly after allowing herself to be tried for blasphemous remarks about her alleged sainthood and her relationship with God. Her trial was never intended to be fair, but instead, a circus for masculinity to triumph over a defenseless woman who was never going to be heard out on anything she had to say. As a result, the males of the court room decide to shame her, cutting off all her hair and physically and mentally abusing her in a barbaric manner that shows little else besides dominance over the meek and powerless in a cruel situation.The result is a heartbreaking film that grabs you with an all-too-real depiction of a time period frequently obscured by the lingo of textbooks and droll college lectures thanks to Dreyer's human approach and intimate focus on facial expressions and steadfast realism. It's only fitting that The Passion of Joan of Arc endured such a brutal life trying to gets its message out to a wide audience; it perfectly replicates the struggle and fight of its titular character.Starring: Renée Jeanne Falconetti. Directed by: Carl Theodor Dreyer.",9,3,5,2 December 2015
Gone Baby Gone," Tension, morality, and choice
","Gone Baby Gone feels like Affleck is making amends with the audience for the one too many mistakes he has claimed to make throughout his decade-long career as an actor. From beginning in heavy-dramas to the occasional comedy in the nineties, to sporadically diverse films like the passable Daredevil and the odious Surviving Christmas, also making tabloid headlines for his relationship with Jennifer Lopez, Affleck's career has been inconsistent and sometimes even depressingly bleak. I have always stood firm on my praise for the man; he plays one of the best straight-men in films and always takes a confident step on to the screen, asserting his determined mindset and impenetrable swagger.Affleck has informed me that as far as power goes, I haven't seen nothing yet. He takes a bold leap in the director's chair with this picture, as he films his younger brother Casey assuming a role of great impact. He plays private investigator Patrick Kenzie and is partners with his girlfriend Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan).The two have recently been hired to find a young kidnapped eight-year-old named Amanda (Madeline O'Brien), yet find complications arousing at every corner from the girl's drug addicted mother, Helene (Amy Ryan), two other cops working the case (Ed Harris and John Ashton), and the police chief (Morgan Freeman). And do not fall under the impression that this is a straight-forward, linear cop drama, because Gone Baby Gone hesitates not to employ twists and turns in every direction; much like a real private investigation.The film's beautifully authentic photography turns Boston into its own grim character, depicting a working class city with a lion's weight of pressure at rest on its shoulders. Performance-wise, the film is highly significant, with Casey taking a good portion of the credit, proving his name should be just as popular as his brother's. It also goes with saying Morgan Freeman is effective and convincing here, and Michelle Monaghan takes the role of Patrick's girlfriend with a pleasing amount of substance, fortunately evading the depressing cliché of 'the girlfriend role.' The brothers Affleck prove that both are worthy of recognition, and both can provide their viewers with a rousing, unsettling setup sure to bring up debate and dissent. Gone Baby Gone isn't as forceful or as gripping and effective as Clint Eastwood's Mystic River (perhaps the only way for the film to be made is that it must be captured through a cold lens), yet its audacious writing and directing provides the audience with one of Affleck's admirably slickest efforts in film.Starring: Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan, Morgan Freeman, Ed Harris, Amy Ryan, and John Ashton.

"Monsters, Inc."," There's a simple story handled appropriately under solid conditions from a great studio. What more do you need?
","Isn't it unfathomable that Monsters Inc. is now twelve years old? Even Pixar's first masterpiece Toy Story is quickly approaching twenty, which is equally unfathomable in any state of mind. Rewatching Monster's, Inc., in light of the upcoming prequel, I couldn't help but realize that Pixar hasn't changed a whole lot in their animation style. Little noticeable additions and upgrades such as lighting and texturing have been made, but changes like that are pretty much unnoticeable to the public. Pixar has been one of the few companies that has done little innovation to the overall layout and design of their animation since their breakout in 1995.Pixar, however, has to remain witty, original, and subversive in their material and story lines to remain the almighty, animation patriarch they've always been. In 2013, I'm proud to save I've never been letdown by a Pixar film so much so that I gave it a negative review. Even their lesser stories are better than Disney's average ones, and even a good Dreamworks movie is not usually the equivalent of an average Pixar one. Monsters, Inc. is a story that is cinematic bread-and-butter, combining the quirks and uniqueness of monsters and articulating their appeal to children wonderfully in a film. While the subject matter may have you thinking otherwise, this is a sweetly appropriate film for children over five, and unlike maybe some modern animated releases such as Hotel Transylvania this one doesn't segregate the viewer solely because they've seen more modern monster films than everyone in the audience.The plot concerns Mike (voiced by the lovable Billy Crystal), a stout, green, Cyclops-esque monster and his pal Sulley (John Goodman), a lovable, furry, blue monster and their duties at Monsters, Inc. The company is dedicated to frightening children of all ages after hours, and to do so, they use a series of doors, assigned to each monster. The doors look like they lead nowhere, but actually house a child's room behind them. When a monster walks back through the door, it is extracted from the ground and taken through an elaborate conveyor belt behind the scenes.Mike and Sulley always find themselves harassed by Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi), who leaves a door on the floor, allowing a child to enter the premises so he can get them kicked out of Monsters, Inc. The child is two years old, unafraid of monsters, and thinks of Sulley as a lovable teddy-bear rather than a ferocious monster. The film follows Mike and Sulley as they try and hide the girl - who they nickname 'Boo' (Mary Gibbs) - from their boss and try to keep their jobs intact.There's a surprising (and equally unsurprising) zealous energy to the material here. By having such a loose plot, the characters are free to roam in many different directions, trying to find a way to keep precious little 'Boo' hidden from all the other monsters.Speaking of the other monsters, Pixar's creativity as a group seems to bleed through Monsters, Inc. as each character has their own artistic design and color scheme to go with them. No two monsters look alike, and none look anything like the classic movie monsters or basic retreads of them, showing Pixar's high creativity. Even if you remain unfazed by the story or the plot, the art design of the characters is something that will hold your attention for quite sometime.Monsters, Inc. is a charming affair that should be equally rewarding for adults as it will be their children. There's no reliance on immaturity, stupidity, or even blatant shallowness. There's a simple story handled appropriately under solid conditions from a great studio. What more do you need? Voiced by: Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, and Mary Gibbs. Directed by: Pete Docter.",9,0,1,20 June 2013
Southpaw," As destined to please as it is destined to exhaust
","Boxing is a barbaric sport that simply makes the possibility of obtaining life-threatening and/or debilitating injuries to someone's life at a young age more prevalent, but yet, it's one of the most popular international sports. Boxing is so popular because of the fact that it's simple and fulfills animalistic aggression inside its spectators and its participators. It takes the frustration and anger emotions and exemplifies them through the universally understood action of punching and beating the everloving hell out of somebody. It fills an audience with excitement and adrenaline, as it does its the actual pugilists, but the common-ground achieved between the audience and the fighters is in the gratification. Through every punch, a strong human chord is struck in everyone who witnesses it and some reaction, internal or external, is prompted.Fighting seems to be embedded in New York City boxer Billy Hope's (Jake Gyllenhaal) life. Raised in foster care throughout much of his young life and making a name for himself thanks to his ability to throw a crushing, Earth-shattering blow to his opponents, Billy has had to fight for something his entire life, be it a meal, a family, or the next belt in the ranks. Right by his side throughout the entire time of his fighting career are his loving wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) and their young daughter Leila (Oona Laurence). After his most recent fight sees him stumble and hesitate a bit more than normal, Maureen tells Billy that he should consider hanging up his gloves for a while, despite intense pressure by his manager (Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson) to ink a deal with HBO.During a ceremony where Billy is set to announce his future plans, an altercation between Billy and rival boxer Miguel Escobar (Miguel Gomez) occurs in the lobby. This simple scuffle results in an all-out brawl, which leaves Maureen shot and killed by Miguel's brother Hector. Billy is beyond distraught; his voice of reason, true love, and his tender touch after all the brutal blows has been robbed from him in the blink of an eye. Billy begins to fall prey to crippling grief, alcoholism, and drug dependency, with the coffin-sealing nail being a disastrous fight that results in him headbutting a referee.When Billy is scraping the bottom of the barrel, constantly in a sorrowful state in addition to being physically and emotionally exhausted following Leila's placement in foster care, he looks towards Titus Wills (Forest Whitaker), a boxing trainer at a local-area gym, for assistance. Titus's mannered, methodical steps are what Billy needs to try and not only revitalize his career but rebuild his life anew.Antoine Fuqua's 'Southpaw' is a brutal picture; similar to 'American Sniper' last year, anyone who isn't used to seeing dramas with a plethora of heartwrenching events an excessive brutality may find themselves really amazed and even startled to see how far this picture goes in painting crippling depression and grief. At the center of all the sadness is Gyllenhaal, who has proved to be one of the most awe-inspiring leading men Hollywood has to offer. Following numerous strong, creepy performances in films like 'Prisoners' and 'Nightcrawler,' 'Southpaw' adds to Gyllenhaal's increasingly polished filmography in terms of showcasing rich, often frightening performances.Gyllenhaal's ability to be completely believable whilst cycling through numerous emotions proves him to be an actor with many impeccable talents. Consider his calculated movements in 'Nightcrawler,' where he held blank stares for much of the film, beared a thin figure, and forced himself not to blink very frequently. Now consider 'Southpaw,' a film where he has to go from one emotion to the next, often within the same scenes, throughout the film's entirety. Certain scenes, particularly with his character's daughter, start with Gyllenhaal holding a drowsy, dazed demeanor and escalate into groveling and crying within two or three minutes.'Southpaw' is almost guaranteed to take the viewer on an emotion roller-coaster, again, especially those not well-acquainted with this territory. For the most part, the film doesn't manipulate audience's emotions, but every now and then, we get the predictable attack lines from Leila to Billy, where the subsequent scenes are set to orchestration. These scenes are clearly meant to prompt reaction and do so in a manner that's less than subtle.It's also worth noting that 'Southpaw' is greatly levied by capable supporting performances by, not only Whitaker, but 50 Cent as well, who is all but guaranteed to get shafted due to his limited scenes in the film. His cut-throat, business-minded character that places personal value on Billy depending on his present monetary value and relevance throughout the film makes for a soul who is consistently interesting on screen, predominately because of how real this character not only feels, but is. This melting pot of varying actors and characters, in turn, makes 'Southpaw''s occasional bouts of sentimentality and narrative predictabilities less apparent than if the acting was subpar.Nonetheless, this is the kind of picture that is destined to please the crowd, similar to 'American Sniper' and 'The Judge,' where even the more negative reviews will fail to keep the populous from enjoying a simple, well-told story about a very human character. Even for a mainstream film, however, 'Southpaw' is a gritty and brutal picture, with well-choreographed action and blows that punctuate an immersive story for those who want the full admission price to feel worth it.",8,1,3,26 July 2015
Ant-Man," A reminder to why we see superhero films in the first place
","Marvel's 'Ant-Man' is the most enjoyable Marvel film since 'Guardians of the Galaxy' and that, in my mind, is no surprise. Marvel's second tier films have a great deal more to offer audiences, especially ones who are well into their superhero fatigue, than the first tier superhero films like 'The Avengers,' 'Captain America,' and 'X-Men.' To begin with, 'Ant-Man' comes with far fewer expectations to live up to for no other reason than the titular character isn't popular amongst the masses. I'm willing to bet most of the people who are seeing 'Ant-Man' over its theatrical run are curious parties that know they love Marvel products and are interested in a superhero of which they've never heard. Of course there are the legion of people who can recite Ant-Man's origins with the accuracy of a patriot's ability to recite 'The Star-Spangled Banner,' but the bulk of the mainstream, I feel, has only heard of Ant-Man from this specific product.Because of this, Marvel doesn't have to stay firmly grounded in their origin conventions and can liberate the writers, directors, and actors in their respective positions. 'Ant-Man,' for instance, lacks the sort of candy-colored Marvel sleekness we've come to expect with the onslaught of these superhero films and, pleasantly so, avoids justifying numerous exploding builds and shattering skyscrapers as the climatic event of the film. Like seeing things from an ant's eye view, 'Ant-Man' toys with perception, captures big action on a small scale (something very revolutionary for Marvel), and packs a wallop that returns to what superhero films should be - unpredictable and fresh.We begin in 1989, where a scientist named Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) resigns from S.H.I.E.L.D. when he realizes the organization is trying to duplicate his shrinking technology. Hank feels his invention was a dangerous accident and wants to keep the technology secret, even from his own organization. In the present day, however, Hank's estranged daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly) and Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) have elbowed their way into management, with Cross creating a shrinking suit he calls 'Yellowjacket' for the purpose of inciting an army of microscopic vigilantes.Meanwhile, upon being released from prison, an amiable thief named Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) moves in with his old cellmate Luis (Michael Peña) and his old crew (made up of rapper T.I. and David Dastmalchian) in order to try and obtain some money to support his child and his ex-wife (Judy Greer), who is now married to a police officer (Bobby Cannavale). Reluctantly, desperate to scrap together quick cash, Lang and his comrades decide to pull off another heist, this one on Hank following a tip that he's away for a weekend.When Lang manages to break through Hank's large safe, he finds what looks to be a motorcycle suit, but upon putting it on, he realizes he now possesses the ability to shrink down to the size of an insect. He is eventually recruited by Hank to stop Cross and his Yellowjacket alter-ego.'Ant-Man' is a wickedly interesting superhero for many reasons, but one of which is the fact that his superpowers aren't the result of a cockamamie genetic mutation. Lang, whenever he doesn't have possession of the suit, is a regular guy, indifferent from you and I, and this relatability amongst heroes grounds the film on a considerably human level. Even after some of the more rigorous action scenes (which aren't nearly as long-winded or tiresome as the ones in 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'), Lang still shows his human side whilst trying to be there for his daughter and do right in a world where it seems the only way to get ahead is to do wrong.Furthermore, Marvel subverts its own action formula by decidedly taking its action sequences down several notches in size and scope. Consider the scene where Lang first puts on the Ant-Man suit and subsequently shrinks; he is sucked down the drain of a shower onto lower-level floors, one of which is a nightclub. In this one, blink-and-you-miss-it scene, we see much of the tension and possibilities of this character exhausted, yet we're not even close to seeing what else this character can do even after the credits roll. The beauty of a character like Ant-Man is how visceral he is; when I see Captain America take on villains in every film, or even Iron Man attack his enemies with one quip after another, I still feel like I've seen it all.Much has been made about 'Ant-Man''s checkered production history, dating back to the 1980's, and the directorial shakeup that saw Edgar Wright ('Shaun of the Dead,' 'Hot Fuzz') eventually step down but still obtain a screenplay credit alongside the likes of Rudd, Joe Cornish, and Adam McKay. Peyton Reed's directorial vision is still as vibrant as ever, yet simultaneously not relying on a visual assault, but rather, a colorful palette of creativity, and Wright's influence is still very much felt in 'Ant-Man''s script, which is littered with zingers. I was worried that much of 'Avengers: Age of Ultron''s lackluster attempts at comedy that 'Ant-Man' would wade in the water in terms of comedy. Like dozens of ants every year, my worries were squashed.'Ant-Man' is one of the strongest films of Marvel's recent superhero batch, less predictable, more centered on the kind of free-wheeling, unpredictable fun from which superhero films should stem, and lacking the hardened expectations of the masses in favor of a looser approach. Like 'Guardians of the Galaxy,' there's a commendable level of respect for the titular hero, yet a certain irony that just questions, 'how did we get this far?' in a way that doesn't end up insulting the respective hero(es).",9,1,9,21 July 2015
21 Jump Street," Exists in a world driven by two buddies and a formula, yet still finds ways to sidestep pitiful, unnecessary indulgence
","We've come a long way in the field of satires, homages, and parodies, and I suppose that any hope for a straightforward, honest attempt at a film on the Fox show 21 Jump Street is out of the question. Sort of like how we'll probably never see a serious Sherlock Holmes film, since the current ones are very comedic and lack the sophisticated tone of the original shows. The new film, 21 Jump Street, is the R-rated, raucous take on a show that aired back in 1987. To modern audiences, that fact has little importance and is probably not even known. I'm sure some haven't realized why Johnny Depp shows up in a brief but charming cameo. I never watched the program, but know a great deal about it. I can say that the film explores the topic a lot more, using tactics only allowed in an R-rated film. Car chases, explosions, drinking, smoking, and the excessive use of four-letter words to name a few. It's nice to see a decent adaptation of a TV show from many years ago. After watching the lukewarm, unnecessary Dukes of Hazzard, I needed the optimism and reassurance that a successful TV show adaptation can be made.The film is centered on Morton Schmidt (Hill) and Greg Jenko (Tatum), who lived in completely different worlds in high school, with Schmidt being the stereotypical nerd and Jenko being the limelight-soaked jock. Eight years later, both have the same sort of personalities, but are both in a police academy. Schmidt excels in the writing portion of the academy, but flounders in his physical performance, and that's the direct opposite for Jenko. The two realize they can benefit each other in their slouching fields, and quickly become the friends they never thought they'd be.They become officers, and live a life well below modesty, patrolling a rather quiet park on bicycles. After miserably failing their first arrest, their boss sends them to Captain Dickson (Ice Cube, who scores some of the film's biggest laughs), an angry, vicious leader who helps disguise young-looking cops into high-schoolers so they can hunt down illegal substances being sold in a school and 'infiltrate the drugs and find the supply.' Schmidt and Jenko, perhaps, have too much fun with their new job and begin to break every rule possible, resulting in never ending camaraderie, chaos, and misunderstood circumstances. Despite this, the film has a way bigger heart than The Sitter, Hill's last film released in December, and Tatum handles his comedy debut very well, showing signs of a bright future in the area.The buddy cop formula has been beaten into the ground, and there doesn't seem to be much material existing to freshen it. Thankfully, 21 Jump Street isn't indulgent, meaning it's not always in the state where it believes it's doing something unique, passionate, or original. It knows it exists in a world driven by two buddies and a formula, so it decides to have a little fun with its premise and its off-the-wall, implausible ideas. It has the ability to make fun of itself, while still occupying confidence; a rare, often challenging trait to excel at today, and probably an even more challenging thing to accomplish from a new screenwriter. It just so happens, this is the best buddy cop comedy I've seen in years. Better than The Other Guys, and a lot better than Kevin Smith's Cop Out. And that is because of Michael Bacall's hip, witty screenplay that evokes excitement and laughter charmingly and not forcefully.Of course, 21 Jump Street doesn't find itself on the same level of some raunchy comedies, mainly Apatow's, like Knocked Up and Superbad. There is a bit too much of a focus on car chases, including one lengthy race at the end that sort of runs its course after a while. This is one of those cases where the action is coherently depicted, but the result is pretty conventional - despite the use of limousines. Even with that being said, 21 Jump Street is still a bag of bright satisfaction, with few weak spots. It's cheery, engaging, rarely becomes winded, and utilizes the functional blend of eventful debauchery with underlying sweetness and cheeriness. A lesson Project X should've learned and explored.Starring: Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum, Brie Larson, Dave Franco, Ellie Kemper, Rob Riggle, and Ice Cube.

Captain America: The First Avenger," Not as toned as Rogers' figure
","There's a pleasant visual-scheme and aesthetic that exists in Captain America: The First Avenger, thanks in part to its recreation of the 1940's time period. This makes it the most visually unique Marvel film I have yet to see being that all the aforementioned superhero films had the similar, ultra-crisp, spit-shined aesthetic that wouldn't allow a flaw or imperfection to be noticed by the naked eye. With this 1940's costume and set design, we can at least see how Marvel plays with time period, offering up common settings and historical occurrences to go along with this specific time period in a way that is a breath of fresh air from the monotony that can entail with looking at the same kind of superhero film.Having said that, it's disappointing to note how flat Captain America: The First Avenger can be as a whole, despite focusing on a character who hasn't seen much cinematic love outside the ho-hum films of the past few decades. As the film begins, we meet Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), a scrawny individual with numerous health conditions, who still optimistically tries to enroll in World War II because he wants to know he's making a vital difference when serving his country. Rogers gets turned down time and time again, finally given the honor by Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci), who believes that he is the perfect one to play along with his 'super-soldier' experiment that he is concocting. The operation leaves him with side effects that will stick with him permanently, including super-strength, impeccable athleticism, among other physical benefits.Just in time too, with Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving), Adolf Hitler's head of weaponry who possesses his own plan for world domination involving an object called the 'Tesseract.' Schmidt's alter-ego is Red Skull, the famous Marvel villain who runs the terrorist organization HYDRA, which Rogers, now draped in red, white, and blue clothing going by the name of the patriotic mascot 'Captain America,' must find a way to destroy.This is the kind of superhero film, similar to what would later become Iron Man 3, where there isn't really a core thing that's wrong with the picture, but numerous little things that work against the entire project that will come to derail it in the long-run. To begin with, Red Skull's backstory, character, and overall personality is never really laid out for audiences, becoming just another villain we're supposed to root against because of Marvel namesake. Never do we spend enough time with Schmidt to hear more about his plans for 'world domination,' and we're just expected to kind of go with it, passively accepting the cheap excuse for a villain motive.Secondly, the technology, some of which looks the time period, most of it doesn't. The weaponry during the war, the artillery, and a lot of the superhero technology (which may be true to the comic book, I'm unsure) doesn't look at all fit for the time period. It would appear that the crew of costume and set designers spent so much time trying to recreate the exterior of what a 1940's cityscape would look like that they forgot that everything the characters used to fight each other look like just another device from modern-day superhero films.Then there's just the obligatory romance between Rogers and a military commanding officer named Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) that goes shockingly undeveloped and rather cold throughout the film. It doesn't help that the writing team of Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (the same men who wrote all three films in The Chronicles of Narnia franchise thus far) keep this relationship very low-key until near the end when they decide to bring it into the main focus.Those issues aside, Markus and McFeely do a great job at illustrating the shortcomings yet big aspirations that come in a package-deal with Rogers. This element brings to question 'does every superhero need to be musclebound and physically dignified?' I was looking forward to a scrawnier Captain America defending the universe. Then Dr. Erksine's experiment blew up his build considerable (and by 'blew up' I mean the visual-modifications to Chris Evans in post-production were generously ceased).Captain America was a hero I always tied together with Superman in the regard that I never felt any vulnerability or nervousness when he was leaping around from place-to-place. Captain America, especially in this case, seems fazed by absolutely nothing in this film, never being thrown in the face of danger, never seeming to be at any risk of injury or peril, and so forth. This is likely why I enjoy Spider-Man so much as a hero because I could sense physical and mental vulnerability in the character with the same going for Batman in Christopher Nolan's trilogy, as towards the end, we saw a bit of Bruce Wayne's mental vulnerability. I can't make those same connections with the invincible, heartthrob that is Captain America.While I can appreciate and admire that director Joe Johnston efficiently contains most of the action, Chris Evans fits the bill perfectly for Captain America (except, you know, the whole computer-generated weakness business), Tommy Lee Jones' great performance as a military colonel, and the 1940's aesthetic, there's little to offer in terms of something that isn't an interchangeable superhero flick of the modern age. The saving grace is that at least Captain America: The First Avenger doesn't come gift-wrapped in bleeding heart patriotism like it easily could've been. Markus and McFeely thankfully seem to have bigger plans than that, even if they don't all succeed overwhelmingly.Starring: Chris Evans, Hugo Weaving, Tommy Lee Jones, Hayley Atwell, and Stanley Tucci.

Fargo," Oh yah, show it to evrywon
","I think of Fargo as the underdog of cinema; the unassuming, easy-to-miss crime thriller when released that went on to be recognized for its intricate and investing plot, powerhouse displays of acting, and keen regional nuances. The film has now gone on to – dare I say – be something of a classic for the mystery genre, producing several quotable lines, memorable setups, and even a TV show, set to debut later this year.Reviewing a classic is always touchy territory for two specific reasons. The first is that many people have already seen, reviewed, analyzed, and formulated an opinion on the film in question and writing a positive review seems like reiterating all the same points people have done for years and preaching to a disinterested choir. The second is that it's a struggle to find something to talk about in said film that hasn't already been talked about many times before, resulting in a review or an analysis that seems to become groggy and repetitive.With Fargo, however, I'm feeling pretty comfortable in where I stand and what I have to say about it. Explaining the film's story in writing or aloud may find a way to muddle itself, but I'll push through to give the basics. The story involves a crooked car salesman named Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy), who works at a Minneapolis dealership. Pressed for money and fighting desperate times, he negotiates with criminals Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare), whom he meets on a trip to Fargo, North Dakota, to kidnap his wife Jean (Kristin Rudrüd) in exchange for a 1987 Oldsmobile Ciera and $40,000 of the $80,000 ransom. Jerry, in a slick move, plans to inform his wealthy father-in-law and boss Wade Gustafson (Harve Presenell) that the ransom the crooks are asking for is $1,000,000 with the intent of pocketing most of the money.This plan soon turns disastrous by circumstances that should not be spoiled. However, when things go awry and people end up dead, Officer Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand), a quirky, Minneapolis cop with a thick accent, gets on the case and is determined to imprison the dirtbags behind these murders. What we get, though, is an exercise in terrific filmmaking in several areas, from acting, pacing, and depictions and the satirizing of a region that do not tread on mean-spirited, simple-minded jabs for humor. At the core of Fargo is a performance by William H. Macy that needs to be seen to be believed; it's a true performance that spawns mixed reactions, as he sometimes portrays a character we can side with, and other times, portrays one we can't help but loathe. Macy's scenes with Buscemi and Stormare are wonderful too, as all the actors bring something to the table: Macy brings his controlled nature that can often be seen as troublesome, Buscemi brings his outrageousness, and Stormare brings his collective mannerisms.The Coen brothers, Joel (the film's director) and Ethan (the film's co-writer and sole credited producer), could've stopped there and had a great film, but they continue on, with a windy, but completely investing storyline predicated off of plot and wild twists and turns. Normally, I criticize films that make too heavy of an emphasize on story and not enough on character. Instead, the Coen brothers make each individual character distinct in someway, be it their mannerisms, what they say, or even how they say it. This is where the attention to detail for the region comes in. Frequently, the Coens make dual note of the typical niceness Midwesterners tend to possess, as well as the moralistic goodness they provide through their often thick and monotone accents.The Coens turn Fargo into a hilariously observant work, complete with great pacing, Roger Deakins' impeccable cinematography that never fails to capture locational beauty, making the Midwestern snow shockingly appealing and lovely, and just the benefits of a great story. It's the kind of film that would make a great introduction for people in other countries who have never seen an American film, rather than the abundance of blockbusters and low-rent sequels, don't you think?Starring: William H. Macy, Steve Buscemi, Peter Stormare, Frances McDormand, Harve Presnell, and Kristin Rudrüd. Directed by: Joel Coen.",9,0,0,7 April 2014
Nightcrawler," The only thing worse than a nightcrawler is the coroner in the eyes of a victim
","'Nightcrawler' is the kind of film that will catch audiences by surprise with its painstaking thoughtfulness, and features the kind of lead character that will be discussed in film circles who don't detest American cinema and actually give it the benefit of the doubt. The film plunges us into the dark, seedy world of a nightcrawler, somebody who, often working freelance with his or her own equipment and schedule, patrols the streets of crowded cities with multiple police scanners searching for recently-committed crimes in the neighborhood, like rape, shootings, murders, car accidents, and so forth. The object of a nightcrawler is to get candid and intimate shots of the ugliness that plagues these scenarios as quickly and as neatly as possible and sell them to news stations or eyewitness programs to turn quick profit. Job requirements include possible insomniac, lack of emotional connection or any immediate empathy to tragedy or horror, exceptional navigational/driving skills, and a load of free time.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Lou Bloom, a man at rock-bottom living in Los Angeles, selling scrap metal to get money before eventually turning to the nightcrawling business. He teams up with Rick (Riz Ahmed), a young man desperate to make money to keep a roof over his head, who helps navigate Lou's routes as a nightcrawler and learns of numerous police codes to help Lou decipher the police scanner jargon. Together, the two make for an amateur nightcrawling team, turning profit by selling the footage – expertly shot, analyzed, and even occasionally manipulated by Lou – to Nina (Rene Russo), the station manager of a severely failing news station that is in dire need to regain viewership.Ultimately, 'Nightcrawler' juggles two tricky but immersing features with its material, simultaneously giving us a look into a grimy and often dirty gig as somebody who is essentially a voyeur into the most vulnerable time of the people he meets and posing frightening commentary on contemporary news. The nightcrawler is not looking to help or to provide encouragement; he's there to get his shots and move on, hoping to turn as large of a profit as he can. We see Los Angeles in the light of what could be classifiable as a contemporary film noir, in dark, sometimes shadowy-photography and dingy environments that reveal an ugliness to a city that is normally captured as very beautiful and ideal in terms of climate. Director Dan Gilroy and cinematographer Robert Elswit (a frequent collaborator of Paul Thomas Anderson) do everything in their power to subvert our ideas of Los Angeles and focus on transitory locations that show the ugliest of human events in such a way that is beautiful and captivating thanks to crystal-clear photography.The other feature 'Nightcrawler' toys with is the contemporary exploration of journalistic ethics and how, with local cable news competing with so many twenty-four hour news stations, who, in turn, are also battling more rapidly-updated social media websites, the manipulation of news is ever-present on Television. News programs, like sitcoms, reality shows, and sports events, are a game of numbers and those numbers are ratings – something that 'Nightcrawler' makes depressingly clear to us. A crucial scene to this message comes into play when Lou has shot and sold the defining tape of his career and has worked to manipulate it for personal gain. He watches as Nina plays the tape on the air, directing the news anchors in such a specific way in terms of language and mannerisms that we see the fear-mongering happen right before our eyes.On top of all the social commentary, we see amazingly realistic crime scenes and car accidents to boot. Perhaps it's the lack of intimacy many directors lend to these situations, often showing a car accident, and characters limping and trudging along with little bloodshed, but 'Nightcrawler' details these scenes with an incredible eye for attention and realism. Gilroy makes us the voyeur and gives the window into these car accidents that we glance over to see but not entirely anticipate or really want to see. The attention to detail in these seems is simply exquisite and uncommonly believable.'Nightcrawler,' in addition, features a wonderful performance by Gyllenhaal who, like his co-star Paul Dano in last year's 'Prisoners,' plays detached and empty with such conviction, and channels something of an inner-Philip Seymour Hoffman in 'Owning Mahowny,' showing his character's complete fulfillment when obsessing over his job and his work. Even Riz Ahmed shouldn't be overlooked here, playing the overworked and under-appreciated assistant to Gyllenhaal's Lou in a role that could've been an empty, and even distracting, side role. The entire project is rich in commentary, performances, and environmental beauty that it could easily be one of the most complete films of the year.",9,252,313,3 November 2014
The Aviator," Soaring yet falling
","The Aviator is, yet another, Scorsese masterpiece that deals with the life and glory of a character I would've never seen myself liking so much. The story is focused on Howard Hughes, a character who, undoubtedly, is foreign to many people in the present. Hughes inherited his parents' fortune at twenty-two, directed the most expensive movie at the time, spent money worse than a drunken sailor, and was building planes that were set to be used by the Army Air Forces. Enigmatic, yes. But far from a feasible hero.Hughes is played effortlessly by Leonardo DiCaprio. He has already established that he'll take any role, from J. Edgar to a man on a doomed ship, and he has been on a continuing streak of fantastic films. We can pretend Romeo and Juliet never existed. Here, he accepts the challenge to focus on the glory years of Hughes (1927 to around the early forties), where he was living the dream, then quickly becoming his own worst enemy. DiCaprio's challenge is also presented when he must transition Hughes delicately from a fully functioning, money-hungry womanizer to a slowly, defeatist madmen without overacting or hammering home on the clichés. The result is beyond commendable.Hughes, himself, was a man that possessed energy, efficiency, courage, and determination in limitless amounts. He had the ability to pick up any woman he wanted, say anything he wanted, and casually ask a woman to marry him like one would say 'pass the salt.' Not only was he a professional ladies man, he was a surreal filmmaker, directing a film called Hell's Angles at twenty-two. After two years of unprecedented hell trying to get the film shot efficiently, right down to cloud formations, he casually tells his business executive, Noah Dietrich (Reily) that he'd like to reshoot it, this time, occupying sound to please a demanding audience. Was he completely unaware of the time and money he put into the silent version, or just a reckless spender of money? Going back to his womanizing ways, one woman Hughes put through hell and high-water was Katharine Hepburn (Blanchett). She had to put up with his increasing OCD habits, not to mention once his name became big because of Hell's Angles, all the starlets that would inevitably follow. She left him soon after, much to his dismay.What did Hughes do maybe achieve closure or ease the pain? Become involved with more women. One of them was fifteen year old Faith Domergue (Garner) and another being the amazingly beautiful Ava Gardner (Beckinsale).After his work behind the camera, Hughes put films in the foreground, as he wanted to focus on something bigger; aircrafts. He loved them more than life itself. He had a monstrous idea; to build a blame that could float on water and soar higher than plausible. He would name it 'Hercules,' a name of piercing accuracy.The art direction is extraordinary. One of the most thrilling scenes involves something Scorsese rarely uses, but when it is applied, he always uses effectively; special effects. The scene involves Hughes crash-landing in Beverly Hills with the wing of the plane slicing the rooftops of houses like a table saw cutting through a tin can. This scene is fantastic because it doesn't focus on the awesomeness of it all, but it the peril and the exhilaration Hughes must have felt while in the plane. His struggle to get out is absolutely haunting and impossible to ignore.Apparently, Scorsese mimicked the bipack color scheme used in films back in the day. This adds sort of a lighter, 'easy on the eyes' kind of tonality that I have not experienced in films in a long time. Green objects appear to be blue, and some of the later scenes are shots using three strip Technicolor. Not only does Scorsese utilize old technology to tell a timeless story, he presents it the way it would've been told back then. Colorized stock footage mainly makes up the aerial battles, which are wonderfully coherent and intense as can possibly be.Another thing to pay close attention to are the planes. They are scale models, rather than computer creations. This, again, adds to the 'easy on the eyes' tonality. Everything is natural and looks ravishing, better than anything that could've been created from a software program. It only provides to the already extremely genuine picture we are watching.Howard Hughes was determined, enigmatic, energetic, courageous, yet a sad figure overall. A man consumed by his fear and his uncontrollable OCD. The later scenes of his life, which I dare not spoil, are so devastating and upsetting they are sometimes hard to watch. Here's a man that had it all, then plummeted into a dark, endless hole of murkiness never to be mentioned again until his tragic death in 1976. Rather than plod along through the most likely noneventful teen years leading up to the production of Hell's Angles, The Aviator chooses to reestablish the glory days of Hughes. The film omits the darker days of Hughes life, such as the sixties and the seventies. What we're supposed to feel at the end is unclear, but one thing is for sure, if we walked out sad, it would be extremely out of place.Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Cate Blanchett, Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, Kate Beckinsale, John C. Reilly, Gwen Stefani, and Jude Law. Directed by: Martin Scorsese.",10,3,4,27 February 2012
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Let it be known that Robin Williams is a multi-faceted talent
","Good Morning, Vietnam has the uncanny ability to surprise. At around the hour mark, I was convinced that the film, while funny and impossibly kinetic and energetic in tone and performance, was solely sticking to this act of energy, while maybe touching but not capitalizing at the apparent possibility of an emotional subplot. Sure enough, director Barry Levinson and writer Mitch Markowitz manage to work in a seriously believable and touching bout of sentimentality to a picture so manic one doubts that it could possibly fit comfortably inside of it. The film is the perfect blend of manic, disposable energy and tender drama that it becomes a film to seriously commend in many different departments.Robin Williams is at the film's core as Airman Second Class Adrian Cronauer, who arrives in 1965 Saigon to work as a DJ for the Armed Forces Radio Station. He meets and takes a liking to the straight-laced and genial Private First Class Edward Montesquieu Garlick (Forest Whitaker), who also takes a liking to Cronauer after seeing what the man can do with a microphone and a broadcasting signal. Cronauer's radio broadcast, contrary from the archetypal and uninspired transmissions the bases were used to hearing, are irreverent and fun, with lively bursts of energy and unpredictable wit coming directly from the mind of its radio DJ. This leads him to be immensely controversial with his peers. However, Cronauer becomes supported and rejoiced by his students who attend his English language learning class on a frequent basis, proving that while he does things differently, the man has the incredibly ability to connect and to inspire.It should be dually noted that Williams exercised the practice of improvisation while performing his wild-and-out radio shows in Good Morning, Vietnam, for it shows extreme comic energy, timing, and capability. Williams indefatigably, zealously delivers monologues of true power during his radio shows, zipping by with unprecedented comedic speeds, with jokes so sneaky and quick that you're bound to miss at least a few. His character Cronauer doesn't even a cohost for his radio show, as he is the sole provider of such indescribable energy and fun in the film.Furthermore, Williams works to illustrate Markowitz' more sentimental and emotional second half, which isn't as emotionally manipulating as one would expect. Rather than carelessly paint a second half so somberly, immediately following a goofy but thoroughly enjoyable first half, Markowitz carefully constructs scenarios and characters for us to latch onto as likable souls victim to a senseless, brutal war. After an hour of Williams' rampant comedic delivery, despite it being incredibly enjoyable, I was expecting the entire film to only vaguely come to an emotional or even dramatically investing second half. As Markowitz goes on, however, he totally creates a wonderful climax and conclusion to the film.In addition, let it be known that Williams works tirelessly to detail the emotions necessary for the film to succeed. He transitions ever-so naturally from manic energy to humble and sentimental, effectively but commendably illustrating a drastic divide in emotions so beautifully. The performance at hand rightfully earned him an Oscar nod and affirmed a potentially skeptical audience of Williams' incredible on-screen energy.Starring: Robin Williams and Forest Whitaker. Directed by: Barry Levinson.",9,1,1,8 September 2014
American Pie," The structure and plot is the pie, while the characters are the attractive and sweet whipped cream
","American Pie is smarter than many, many other teen films that I've seen over the last few years. Its depiction of the fun, spontaneous antics that exist in high school don't take the nihilistic or dehumanizing route many films of the same genre do. Some have written the film off as 'unoriginal,' and while it really isn't, it's a comedy for a new generation. The seventies had National Lampoon's Animal House, the eighties had Porky's, and the nineties got a nice helping of pie.The film follows four naive Michigan high school students, who are close to each other, but not to the people they truly want to be close to; girls. Jim (Biggs) is a pasty, awkward teenager hoping to get lucky with the foreign exchange student Nadia (Elizabeth), Chris 'Oz' Ostreicher (Klien) is the all-star lacrosse player trying to make things work with the sweet, innocent, and charming choir girl Heather (Suvari), Kevin (Nicholas) is the self-confident and sexually motivated one of the group, hoping to have sex with his girlfriend Vicky (Reid) before they go off to separate Colleges, and Finch (Thomas) is the shy, solemn soul who usually sits idly by while the antics unfold. The four make a pact to lose their virginity by the end of high school, hoping to make it all happen the night of Senior Prom. The gang's motivation comes from their loudmouth buddy Steve Stifler (Scott), who is unapologetically crude, yet irresistibly lovable.Perhaps the funniest character in the entire film is Jim's dad (Levy), who must be the most conscious and understanding father in the history of film. Many teen films portray parents as out of touch codgers with no knowledge or comprehension of current events. Jim's dad is the total opposite. He is way too understanding, even when his son tries to practice his moves on a baked apple pie.One character that seems tragically underused is Vicky's friend Jessica (Lyonne). The character is seen at rare points in the film, usually providing her friend with sex insight. She seems like the black sheep of the group, who doesn't fit in anywhere and doesn't really want to. When she does turn up on screen, usually for a slender amount of time, she is witty and fun, much like the rest of the characters.I was never hugely fond of the eighties' generation-definer Porky's. I found it to be a little weak on the characterization, yet still on par with its projection of high school students. The reason why American Pie soars high on the grading scale is because it manages to provide us with lovable characters that would become familiar to us like those in a sitcom. These characters are sunny and infectious with their one-liners and their wisdom. They aren't indulgent, meaning they are always learning new things and reciting a good moral or two. After not seeing the film in many years, the end scenes were a big surprise to me. It shows the characters are gaining insight and knowledge; I thought that simply couldn't happen in a teen movie. The end also goes in a way one did not expect. I was crossing my fingers that it wouldn't turn into the cartoony cliché I was thinking, and what do you know, it turned out to be just as sweet as the film itself.What a joyous and lovable excursion American Pie is. It provides well delivered, intelligent laughs and realizes that it doesn't need to discover a new 'breast per screen' ratio in order to be funny or memorable. It introduces us to naive, confused teenagers, perhaps somehow reflecting ourselves at the time, and goes from there in what appears to be a totally fresh take on the subject of losing ones virginity. It is simple, efficient, and wholesome even when it shows its darker side.Starring: Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan, Chris Klein, Natasha Lyonne, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Tara Reid, Mena Suvari, Eugene Levy, and Eddie Kaye Thomas.

Hot Rod," The underrated comedy of 2007
","The opening scene of Hot Rod feels like it's warming up for a Lonely Island tune to be played. That is sort of how the whole movie feels. Like one big music video. An enjoyable one that is a lot of fun, and has a different kind of humor. Lonely Island type humor. Hot Rod is about an aspiring stuntman named Rod Kimble (Samberg) who, in honor of his late father, creates ramps with his lackluster crew (Fisher, McBride, Taccone, Wilson) and jumps them with his moped.His step-father (McShane) is in need of a heart transplant, so him and his crew participate in jumping fifteen full size school buses and plan to raise $50,000 so Frank can have the surgery. Along the way, they run into obstacles, and minor things test their friendship. But friendship wins every time as one would expect.Hot Rod is a homage to Evel Knievel, and even knows how to poke fun at itself. In one scene, the announcer at the stadium says something like 'We must raise $50,000 for Rod's step-father's conveniently priced surgery.' The story itself knows it is nothing new, but it tackles it as if it was.The Lonely Island is a comedy band on Saturday Night Live who make 'Digital Shorts' and Music Videos that either poke fun at a certain style, or are just goofy little clips. They have released two studio albums, but they did that after the release of this movie so not everyone knew who Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer (the director of Hot Rod), and Jorma Taccone were.I had a lot of fun with the crew in the film. Especially with Jorma Taccone's character. The whole crew clicked every time they were on screen. They were goofy and enjoyable. Rainn Wilson, from Superbad, also has a supporting role as one of the member's from the crew and it's hard to hate him when he's playing the character he is.Hot Rod's humor isn't hard to get or like. You just need to have a good sense of it. The whole movie seems like it could be made into a music video with the title The Ballad of Rod Kimble. Pretty much every piece of comedy they bring to the table works, and it makes this comedy pretty cool beans.Starring: Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, Rainn Wilson, Isla Fisher, Danny R. McBride, and Ian McShane. Directed by: Akiva Schaffer.",8,1,5,21 June 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," An outsider looking in
","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is adventure and fantasy filmmaking at its finest, and I see no reason why fans of the novel and the series all together would not find it commendable or laudable. It exceeded my personal expectations, and I have never read J. R. R. Tolkien's acclaimed trilogy, nor did I possess any prior knowledge of the stories ahead of time. The experience was open for many surprises, and boy did it bring some.The story, which I will do my best to explain, is set in Middle Earth, sixty years after the Dark Lord Sauron tried to conquer it by using the One Ring, which rules and binds the people together. At the time of the attempt to conquer the land, the ring was left in possession of Hobbit Bilbo Baggins, who has now passed it on to his nephew, Frodo (Wood). Wizard Gandalf the Grey (McKellen) informs Frodo of Sauron's powerful forces and sends him and his friend Samwise (Astin) out of town so they can destroy the ring and prevent any abuse of power. Along the way, they pick up numerous friends and acquaintances, and together, they are off to destroy the ring. The wonderful ring of...Middle Earth.It may come as a surprise to some people that this is actually the third attempt to bring J. R. R. Tolkien's book to film. The first attempt was done in 1978 by Ralph Bakshi, while the second was a Television film called The Return of the King in 1980. It almost seemed The Lord of the Rings series was plagued of having inferior, slightly incompetent films and was unable to adapt to the big screen, until Peter Jackson blew everyone, including the Oscars, away with his star-studded, beautifully made adaptation of one of the world's most beloved series.Yes, The Lord of the Rings is a beauty. Mainly in its art direction, which is heavily detailed and breathtaking in appearance. Special effects run rampant in Jackson's film, and they are used as an enhancement tool rather than as a simple distraction. This wasn't long after The Matrix was released, so having the audience treated to a world-wind of special effects still wasn't very common in films. I have been told from many fans of Tolkien's work was that what made the novels work so well was (a) they were long and unexpected, almost seeming as if anything could happen, always leaving the reader in some essence of suspense and involvement and (b) were extremely vibrant, detailed, and descriptive. Atmospheres were always described intricately, suspense and peril were captured with a great sense of urgency and delight, and the characters were sweet, charming, and very, very developed.If I had to knock the epic for being one thing, it's that it seems from all the things I have read and been told about the novel, it's as if the film focuses a bit too much on action and swordplay. Still, there's enough buildup and dialog to keep one interested. The film may have a simple plot, but it evokes it as if it was a complex, never-ending journey through the sands of time.The performances are to die for. Sean Astin, a very underrated talent whom we saw in Encino Man and The Goonies, is all grown up and spunky here as Sam, the wisecracking admirable Hobbit, and Elijah Wood is capable and simply mesmerizing as Frodo. But the grand performance of the epic easily goes to Ian McKellen as the always intriguing and slightly ominous Wizard Gandalf. McKellen plays a wizard how I believe a real one would act. Witty, a tad clumsy, but very insightful and enriching every time he speaks, as well as providing much needed reassurance and optimism. It can be considered an unforgivable crime not to have awarded him the Best Supporting Actor award.And now, for the question of the hour; will I pursue the other two films? As of now, I don't plan on it. The Fellowship of the Ring was a marvelous excursion, but a protracted and extensive one, sometimes providing boredom. Fantasy has never been my cup of tea, as I have always preferred my films with a sense of realism, comedy, suspense, and characters. There are people who take the genre seriously and I can't blame them. We must treasure works of mythical art in the time of depressing and oppressive circumstances, and to the ones who get very involved with a franchise or series, I admire and envy you. It was just never my thing.But who knows? Perhaps one day I will complete the odyssey that is The Lord of the Rings. I told myself going in that this film had to be very, very immersing and reach untold levels of excitement and involvement for me to move on to two other films totaling in over six hours. It was very good, but not good enough for me to invest one fourth of a day in the rest of the material.Starring: Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom, Liv Tyler, John Rhys-Davies, Sean Bean, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, and Ian Holm.

Man of Steel," The silver bullet flies far past its target
","Zack Snyder's Man of Steel is an exhausting summer blockbuster, clocking in at one-hundred and forty-three long minutes and boasting enough special effects that could be adequately housed in two one-hundred minute films. By the time the credits roll, I was ready to admit defeat to the film's non-stop special effects and sixty-five minute concluding battle-scene. Just when you think it's over, out pops another trap or accessory that has the ability to start things all over again. Things like that are when I begin to think superhero films are almost cheating at their own game.The big question is will this satisfy comic-book readers and please devotees of the caped-man in blue? I honestly have no idea. It rewinds time, yet again, to produce another origins story about the imminent destruction of the planet Krypton, which results in Jor-El (Russell Crowe) sending his infant son down to Earth. His son's pod crashes in Kansas, where he is raised by a gracious religious couple played by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane under the name 'Clark Kent.' Clark grows up with unearthly powers, such as the ability to shoot laser-beams out of his eyes and see through walls and skin. Later in life, he evolves into Superman, and his duty calls when General Zod (Michael Shannon) threatens the safety of the planet Earth if he isn't returned to him at once.Superman, this time around, is played by Henry Cavill, a likable soul who is unfortunately burdened by inhabiting an entirely cold shell of a superhero. Superman has almost no personality, and is even robbed of the internal Clark Kent/Superman identity crisis that has been so prominent since Superman's surface in the comic books. If anything, from watching the original 1978 classic a matter of days ago and viewing this one, it seems that both films portray him as nothing more than the textbook hero figure that comes equipped with heavy morality and inert development. It seems that the character's mood is shaped not over time but by the characters close to him, such as the Daily Planet journalist Lois Lane (Amy Adams), Zod, or his parents. He doesn't appear to possess the ability to develop through his own internal-thought process and remains almost a voodoo doll to others in terms of what he should do and how he should do it; there's little independent thinking going on in his head. He almost always does what is expected of him and that's no fun.In addition, Snyder misses a bold opportunity at exploring the agony of the character. In a scene lasting roughly three minutes, he shows a young and overwhelmed Clark Kent in the classroom, becoming nauseated and dizzied over his incredible powers of seeing through skin of him and his classmates. Upset, frazzled, and deeply concerned over his well-being and sanity, he runs into a closet and locks the door, shunning himself from the schoolchildren and further ostracizing himself as a 'freak.' The scene, however, solves this immense conflict in a matter of minutes and never returns to the core idea that these powers are curses and not benefits. This frustrating agony in Kent's everyday life is left massively unexplored and we get an underwhelming taste on what the possibilities could bring.Aside from Superman, most of the other characters lack recognizable identities. Shockingly empty and left untouched is Lois Lane, who seems nothing more than the obligatory lead rather than the well-known female protagonist of the entire franchise. Zod, while having the benefit of being played by the remarkable and amazingly talented Michael Shannon, is a pretty ordinary villain, with ordinary superpowers and a numbing ability at producing predictable lines. His time to shine, and the entire film's in retrospect, is when Zod's UFO in the sky shuts down all electricity and plays a demanding message on all electronics demanding Superman's detainment. It's a creepy scene, pulled off effectively because of its unexpected timing and the tremendous eeriness that comes along with the robotic video. Sadly, it takes up about two minutes of this endeavor.Excusing all of the aforementioned details, Man of Steel really amplifies the chaos in the action department. The final battle takes up almost half of the entire film, and featuring dizzying camera-work, indiscernible action, chaotic repetition of Superman and Zod careening into building, and loud, overly-bombastic sound-effects that sit right up there with 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon.' I almost feel guilty critiquing this part, since I talked down about the excessive use of slow-motion videography in Snyder's 300. Now, I wish he at least slowed this film down to a more watchable level. Shots begin and end so quickly, the rapid-fire editing does nothing to the overall suspense or quality, and the final battle, itself, defines muchness in cinema. There becomes a point went 'coolness' becomes monotonous and I think that could accurately sum up much of Snyder's career in film.Man of Steel was written by David S. Goyer, who penned all three installments of Nolan's Batman trilogy. Christopher Nolan, himself, donates his name as a producer's credit on this film as well. Despite these talented names behind the scenes and the effective actors in front of the camera, 'Man of Steel' hardly has a leg to stand on. It doesn't capture its environment, character, or its depth even half as well as the aforementioned 'Batman' trilogy did, and leaves its character wholly vacant of personality and its action muddled and sloppy. Man of Steel could definitely take notes from The Dark Knight Rises in terms of recognizing humanity in its title character and disregarding ponderous action sequences. Action sequences are only memorable for so long; character conflicts and relationships in superhero films are what make them memorable and even relatable. With this film, Superman, again, remains an alien to the public as he does many of the characters in this film.",5,2,6,17 June 2013
Grease," Frankie Valli said it best
","In the grand scheme of Broadway musicals turned films, the one everyone seems to know is the 1978 adaptation of Grease. It has proved itself timeless with its over-the-top portrayal of 50's culture and hilariously broad performances by its two wonderful leads. It may not be the best musical, you'll be hard-pressed to find a film wackier, more enjoyable, and more subversive than the 1975 cult musical which I believe doesn't need to be named, but for a film that works mostly on its own terms, it's flyweight and easy to love.John Travolta, always a charming, energetic actor, plays Danny, the kid at the school who sports black leather, jeans, and greasy, slicked-back black hair affirming his style and attitude. Singer Olivia Newton-John plays Sandy, a good girl with hair of gold. We see the two say a long goodbye on the beach after a summer of clear passion and enjoyment disintegrates into distant memories as Sandy must return to Australia.Cue the wonderfully animated title cards with the Frankie Valli song we all know and we are at Rydell High School, the school where people wear their social cliques and popularity status like a brand new leather coat. It comes as a surprise to us and to the characters that Sandy has switches to RHS, and, after a fabulous 'Summer Nights' dance number, this discover their newfound romance can continue. Well, in a perfect world that is, and that would not be the case.Danny Doesn't want to risk his astronomical reputation as a bad boy just so he can date some goody-two shoes girl. He provokes her and her friends to impress his, but we can see he doesn't mean what he says. The rest of the pictures involves the two desperately trying to express their love for each other and singing whenever they get the chance.Like many musicals, the exposition is rather slim, while the production values and the performance of the songs are put ,more into focus. This isn't a bad thing, but after a catchy music number returning to mildly interesting setups can be an abrupt, awkward change at first. Thankfully, the film knows how to punctuate its antics.The film's charm mainly comes from Travolta, who delivers energy and dominance in limitless quantities. He seems fully comfortable when he needs to be, mainly during the songs, and totally capable and reliable as the person at the wheel during the scenes in between the singing and dancing. He is only made better by Olivia Newton-John, whose smile and personality go a long way in the picture.As far as films go, this isn't a very great one. It's choppy and so sweet it causes cavities and puts the viewer at risk for diabetes (face it, I like John Waters' Cry-Baby, the even more self-aware parody a bit more than this). As far as musicals go and as far as cheery camp goes, Grease shines through it all, completely showing its viewer just why it has been loved for so many years. It may not have the grand amount of depth I crave when I watch films, but its production values, charismatic leads, and infectious song and dance numbers provide it with enough substantial entertainment value.Starring: John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John, and Stockard Channing.

Footloose," Cut Footloose
","Footloose is probably the most overrated and least impressive eighties film I can think of it. Without the music, Kevin Bacon, and the end dance scene, there is nothing memorable or special about this one note film. I can't even put it into a genre. It's not comedy because very few moments are funny. It's not a drama because it is too goofy to be one. And it's not a musical because there is no singing. This could very well fit the 'miscellaneous' section in any film category.Kevin Bacon plays sweet and simple Ren. Ren moves with his mother from Chicago to the small rural town of Bomont. Upon learning that things are much more uptight in the town, he also comes to discover that rock music and dancing is banned. This is because Reverend Shaw Moore (Lithgow) believes that is nothing but a troublemaking nuisance. Ariel (Singer), the Reverend's daughter, begins to catch the eye of Ren so now he has two things on his plate.The main problem is Footloose tries too hard to leave a mark on the eighties fabric and just ends up being a hodge podge of different things. For one, it's a movie that focuses on a serious issue, the banning of music. But its comical characters and poorly written script dumb it down. The film, also, breaks out into dance sessions with no explanation other than to showcase its soundtrack.The soundtrack is pleasant to listen to. It's filled with great tunes from back in the day. Including the title song by Kenny Loggins, a favorite of mine. Another thing is tries to be is an awkward love story between the Reverend's daughter and Ren. The Reverend's daughter can be sweet and sincere, but she's not the brightest bulb because she does the impossible and stands on the edge of two cars while a semi comes closer and closer. That's intelligent.Footloose is harmless because it doesn't offend anyone. No one will take anything to heart, except the fact I think this film is a case of 'talked about too much, resulting in too little.' There is enough here to sustain a movie, but everything is taken in such an awkward, one dimensional manor that it's hard to like.Some people will be able to find the humor, the drama, and the fun in Footloose and that's great. Unfortunately, because the film is such a mixture of various genres that are all done in an incomplete manor I doubt that will be an easy thing to do. I wonder if Kevin Bacon had been replaced with someone, unknown, like C. Thomas Howell and if the music had been less common, but still boasted the same topic and same name if it would've been half as popular as this is.Starring: Kevin Bacon, John Lithgow, Lori Singer, and Dianne Wiest.

Lilo & Stitch," An unattractive character that manages to become undeniably cute
","The original theatrical poster of Disney's Lilo and Stitch is one that perfectly compliments the picture itself using very, very few words. It shows many of the iconic Disney characters, from Pinocchio to Aladdin, Beauty to the Beast, staring at poor little Stitch who is firmly planted in the center of the poster, looking at the audience and optimistically smiling. This is one of the first times Disney willingly marketed a character that wasn't too presentable in quality, but after staring at his unique blue self for about a half hour, you begin to see the beauty in him, and by the end, he firmly clings to your heart.Lilo and Stitch is one of the brightest, cleanest, and cheerfully different Disney pictures I have seen, and one of the company's bravest of the decade next to Atlantis: The Lost Empire. Unlike that picture, which resulted in a disappointing performance at the box office because of its different look and crisper, more adult-like style, Lilo and Stitch shot and scored with audiences and revenue, and dare I say, was one of their best films of the decade.The story begins with Dr. Jumba Jookiba (voiced by David Ogden Stiers), who is on trial for his latest illegal genetic experiment. The creature, dubbed 'Experiment 626,' is a pint-sized, blue, dog-like creation, aggressive, obnoxious, and very, very sneaky. After being forced to be executed, 626 manages to escape to Earth, crash-landing on Kauai, a small island of Hawaii.It is there where we meet Lilo (Daveigh Chase), a likable, yet alienated soul who is taken care of by her nineteen year old sister Nani (Carrere) after her parents' tragic death. The pair is constantly interrupted by Cobra Bubbles, voiced to perfection by Ving Rhames, a tall, ominous, and intimidating social worker, concerned that Lilo may not be in the best care with Nani, and is planning to move her to a foster home if conditions aren't up to his standards.Frustrated when Lilo's alienation worsens, Nani takes her to an animal shelter, where she finds Experiment 626, who was taken there after being hit by a truck late in the night. She adopts and names 626 'Stitch' and they quickly become best friends. The creature, at first, is ill-behaved and lawless, worse than any dog one could have. But later on, he develops heart and, what was originally intended to be a plan of cunning instincts, being taken under the wing of an innocent girl to be protected from Dr. Jumba and his bumbling sidekick Agent Pleakley (McDonald), becomes a truly real story of family (or 'ohana' in this case) devotion, self-worth, love, and a keenly observant lesson in philosophy. This story is appealing to everyone, and for a while, it seemed that Pixar was light years ahead of Disney, while at this point in time, they were neck and neck.The animation is beautifully rendered and bleeds classic style. This was, again, the time period where animation was changing. Pixar invented the 'full length CGI feature' idea, and it was at this point in time where movies of both the classic, hand drawn vibe were being released, as well as newly invented computer animated features. This proved to many that despite flashy tech-work and glossy colors, that it is the story that matters, and that Disney was still able to deliver a rich, compelling feature of depth and heart.Lilo and Stitch is simply a wonderful film. It packs in undying morals to accompany its premise, never seems to become more interested in awkward sentimentality and witty one-liners, and always seems focused, sophisticated, and effervescent in its idea of 'doing what it can with what it has.' It has brilliant voice actors, elegance in its art direction, a smooth script, and a touching and sometimes poignant story that serves as a feast for the heart. It is an absolute treat.Voiced by: Daveigh Chase, Chris Sanders, Tia Carrere, David Ogden Stiers, Kevin McDonald, Ving Rhames, and Jason Scott Lee.

Armageddon," The only film I can think of that should come with an Ibuprofen and a watch with a purchase of the DVD
","I regard the quality of Michael Bay's Armageddon with great sorrow but regard its enormous box office revenue with an even greater amount of depression. Has the magic of cinema been reduced to utter mindlessness that is devoid of content, meaning, and substance? You could defend the film by saying it's a 'turn your brain off' film, but what kind of compliment or defense is to that a film? That's like saying it's a requirement to be stupid before watching it in order to enjoy the picture simply on an entertainment level.Armageddon doesn't deserve that defense or any others. It's a terrible picture but in many ways does it embody everything that is wrong with American cinema as a whole. Racism, contrived emotions, overblown instances of peril, noisy, muddled sequences, hammy relationships, stupid characters, and patriotic, flag-waving nonsense thrown in for good measure. You look at a picture like this and wonder why we look like a slew of amateurs in terms of tonality and originality when compared with other world cinemas.The story concerns the fact that an asteroid the size of Texas is on its way to earth, and NASA scientist Dan Truman (Billy-Bob Thornton) has a plan to bury a nuclear device deep inside the asteroid that will break the asteroid into two separate chunks and miss earth. You'd need Bill O'Reilly, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, and a slew of other journalists and astrophysicists to explain that kind of certainty. Desperate to find those that could pull off an operation like this successfully, NASA contacts Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis), one of the best deep-sea oil driller in the world, for advice and assistance in staging the operation. Harry, however, has his own problems like keeping his adult-daughter Grace (Liv Tyler) away from her new boyfriend, who happens to be A.J. Frost (Ben Affleck), one of Harry's younger, more irresponsible drillers.Long-story short, he chooses to accept the mission and takes his crew of utter misfits along with him to assist him in these efforts. Among them is the overly-sensitive and sometimes violent Michael Clarke Duncan, the insane Steve Buscemi, the sophisticated prodigy Owen Wilson, the irresponsible A.J., and others. I don't care how desperate NASA would be in this certain time and I don't care how willing and confident Harry and his crew would be, nobody would send this crew into space under any given circumstance. The thought is truly baffling that the fate of the U.S. essentially rests in a man's crew who can't solve a simple problem without shouting or arguing.But leave logic at the door, since that's what we're supposed to do and look at the film's aesthetics, content, and quality. This is an incredibly boring picture, disgustingly overlong, horrendously underwritten and underdeveloped, and unspeakably redundant. By the umpteenth explosion around the fifty minutes mark, I was ready to wave the white flag. How loud does a popcorn movie have to be before we get the point? How screamingly obvious does every explosion need to be that it had the mass, density, and magnitude to level buildings, burn infrastructures, and send the camera spiraling into a dizzying frenzy? Michael Bay knows how to make every scene into a spectacle, which is why he has garnered praise and criticism. Some can appreciate it craft as a valuable addition into cinema. I see it as an emphasis on fast food filmmaking, or in other words, filmmaking that has the power to make us demand less story-wise but crave everything action-wise. I'd call these films dangerous to the public because it stops the desire and hunger for creativity and encourages settling on the bare fundamentals of film. In a culture already so easily amused by reality TV and sheer stupidity, it is films like Armageddon we need to uniformly ignore.And if it weren't the explosions being the driving-force the film's badness, it's the abundance of music and emotion to manipulate and tell you exactly how you're supposed to react and feel towards every setup in the film. Between the soundtrack of Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, and Journey giving us the exact feeling we're supposed to possess and the incidents that practically flash what mood we're supposed to feel on the screen, Armageddon offers no room even for audience reactions outside of the norm. If you ever wanted to watch a film and want to be in touch with the mood of the film so much so that you don't even want to process the information being shown to you than this is for you.Armageddon, despite featuring one-hundred and fifty minutes of sensory annihilation in the way of sound and visuals, is one of the most boring films I've seen in years. Inert, lackadaisical, overblown, and lacking in creativity and interpretation, it has gone on to be embraced only by those who could stomach such a degrading endeavor. This is the only film I can think of that should come with an Ibuprofen and a watch with a purchase of the DVD.Starring: Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Liv Tyler, Ben Affleck, Steve Buscemi, Michael Clarke Duncan, Will Patton, and Keith David.

The Revenant," A meditative look into character expressions and beautifully detailed landscapes
","It's 1823 and a gang of hunters are searching for pelts in the wilderness of the newly acquired Louisiana Purchase. The land is made even more treacherous with the presence of the Native American Arikara Indians, who have staged an ambush for the hunters, leaving only ten of the men with no other option but to take a raft deeper into the wilderness.Amidst the ambush, the team's most experienced hunter and guider Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) winds up being mauled by a mother grizzly bear in effort to protect her cubs. In the process, he is seriously injured, with his throat slit, his back mangled and bloodied, and his entire body left in a ravaged mess. The gang finds the mangled Glass and is uncertain what to do with him, despite the party's loudest voice, John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), suggesting they simply put Glass out of his misery and move forward. Nonetheless, they do their best to care for him until two young boys, Jim Bridger (Will Poulter) and Hawk (Forrest Goodluck), Glass's son, offer to stay behind and care for Glass, with Fitzgerald keeping a watchful eye.When Bridger is gone gathering water, Fitzgerald winds up killing Hawk when he begins to weep for his father, leaving a helpless Glass to witness his boy be murdered right before his eyes. When Bridger finally returns, Fitzgerald claims to be unsure of Hawk's whereabouts and demands that the two leave quickly, claiming he saw Indians down by the creek, leaving Glass for dead. As the weather worsens, with blizzards and avalanches abound, Glass does his best to maintain his health and his safety as he finds his way back to camp to exact revenge on Fitzgerald for his son's death.It was only logical that, after giving us the terrific 'Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)' a year ago, writer/director Alejandro G. Iñárritu would stun us all again with a film that is sure to grace the Academy Awards with plenty of nominations. Iñárritu and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki are the best director/cinematographer team of 2015, alongside Quentin Tarantino and Robert Richardson for 'The Hateful Eight,' and Denis Villeneueve and Roger Deakins for 'Sicario.' With that, Iñárritu and Lubezki (also the cinematographer on 'Birdman' and 'Gravity') embellish uncommonly natural locational beauty to contrast with the downright evilness of the characters that inhabit the land.Iñárritu and Lubezki, similar to the Ultra Panavision 70 route that Tarantino and Richardson opted for with 'The Hateful Eight,' capture the lavish land of Alaska with plenty of evocative wide-angle shots that do wonders in showcasing the facial details of the characters in addition to the details of the background. 'The Revenant' is as much about the frigid conditions of the brutal wilderness as it is about character redemption, and Iñárritu and Lubezki do a tremendous job of keeping both in mind as the film progresses. These kinds of films really bring forth a meditative light, and I'll say some moments in the film make you become lost in the scenery and the land itself.The biggest battle with 'The Revenant' isn't so much the unflinching sequence that shows Glass getting mauled by a grizzly bear, complete with blood-curdling screams, bone-crunching, and every other nasty auditory detail of a mauling, but its length and its simplicity. Coming off of 'Birdman,' a film I still regard as pretty under-seen given its accolades and a truly fascinating tale of potential and struggling to live up to your own name, Iñárritu takes a complete one-eighty with this film, being that it's in a totally different setting and focuses on much clearer character motivations.Because of that, after seeing him tackle such lofty ideas in 'Birdman,' 'The Revenant' can't help but feel slight in comparison, or even on its own. Once you get through the extremely brutal sequences in the beginning of the film, the remainder of the film's weight rests on the shoulders of DiCaprio, a proved performer who even seems to struggle with the emptiness of his character. While I don't believe this should be the film to finally earn DiCaprio the Oscar, his performance in the film is much more physical than it was ever meant to be anything else. On that note, he succeeds incredibly, never appearing unbelievable or corny, but yet, there's not much to view Glass as other than a revenge-seeking man.And being that this film is one-hundred and fifty-six minutes, just eleven-minutes shy of the theatrical cut of 'The Hateful Eight,' a film with far more dialog and character interest, 'The Revenant' is sometimes a chore to sit through, despite all it does well for its simple story. Iñárritu and Lubezki's directorial and cinematographical work needs to be appreciated and praised, and DiCaprio's performance also needs to find its way to be commended for its physicality (also, don't sleep on Will Poulter, who shows some real emotional chops playing both conflicted and manipulated), yet that shouldn't excuse 'The Revenant' for its slight nature overall.",7,1,4,8 January 2016
Trouble with the Curve," A possible pioneer
","It pains me to say that I've already heard many people say they will not be seeing Trouble with the Curve because of Clint Eastwood's 'antics' at the Republican National Convention just a few weeks ago. Their loss. Not being able to separate the man from the actor is something that took me a while to do, but the way some do it now is childish and immature. I wonder if those same people knew Eastwood was a Libertarian/Republican when he was playing 'Dirty Harry.' Hard to believe it has been nineteen years since Eastwood himself acted in a film he has not directed. He lends the camera to Robert Lorenz, who assisted him in directing much of Eastwood's filmography, including Flags of Our Fathers and the acclaimed Best Picture winner Million Dollar Baby. Lorenz's captures screenwriter Randy Brown's simple but uplifting, intimate story of a man's devotion to a game and his brewing reconnection with his daughter he seemingly abandoned at a young age.I'll catch you up; Eastwood plays Gus Lobel, an elderly scout for the Atlanta Braves baseball team, who is becoming increasingly frail and ill-equipped with deteriorating eyesight. The Braves are losing faith in Gus's abilities, because in recent years, baseball has been run more by computer predictions and online statistics rather than physically sitting in the stands and scouting. Gus doesn't hold back on his hatred for computers, making them sound like limited fossils and being unable to predict more detailed outcomes. One wonders if he is mindlessly ranting or wouldn't even like a computer if he knew how to use one.Pete, played by John Goodman, on a roll now with winning films, is Gus's close friend who is convincing the Braves' organization that despite Gus's poor eyesight, that he is an invaluable asset and needs to stay. He recruits Gus's daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams), to assist him in scouting a young prodigy in North Carolina, who currently plays for a high school team. Mickey's mother died when she was young and shortly after, Gus sent her to live with relatives whom she barely knew. During the scouting trip, Mickey winds up meeting one of Gus's friends whom he used to scout back in the day, named Johnny 'The Flame' Flanagan (Justin Timberlake), for his one-hundred mile-an-hour fastball. We can see where this is headed.We can see where much of the film is headed throughout its runtime but it's scarcely a burden because the warmth and bold character study on three of 2012's most interesting characters is a soothing and efficient one. Eastwood turns in the racism and foul rants he expertly utilized in Gran Torino for some nuanced anger as Gus, and as always, comes off as charismatic and effortlessly likable. Amy Adams does some fine work here, showing us that she is an up-and-coming female actress that is going under the radar, somewhat like Emily Blunt, and fearlessly plays the role of a woman in desperate need of answers, which her father will not give her. And Justin Timberlake continues to show is versatility and heart playing a totally different character from his last one and hitting every note properly.It would appear that screenwriter Aaron Sorkin could have possibly started a new trend with sports films that was seldom seen before his film Moneyball, and that trend is centering a story around a sport but making the center the characters and not the on-field theatrics. Never are we truly consumed in the story of this young scouter, but we shouldn't be. And never were we truly gripped by the Oakland Athletics players in Moneyball - mainly because we never saw them play or were even formally acquainted with them. Both films center around the same sport, but ones' agenda is to show the gritter business side of baseball, while the other is the story of a father and daughter reconnecting with the sport in the foreground. With both films, it's needless to say, I'm all for this brewing trend.Starring: Clint Eastwood, Amy Adams, Justin Timberlake, Matthew Lillard, and John Goodman.

Bridge of Spies," Standard moral and thematic inclusions can't disturb a film largely built on meditative quietness
","Steven Spielberg's 'Bridge of Spies' opens in a quiet, almost meditative manner, giving us a sense of the hustle in 1957 Brooklyn during the brutal Cold War. Spielberg focuses on movements of characters and slow, melodic buildup that results in a shockingly peaceful opening, giving what we can foresee will occur. We then cut to a man named Rudolph Abel (Mark Rylance), who retrieves a secret message in public before he returns to his apartment to be apprehended by FBI agents believing he is a Soviet spy.Subsequently, James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks), a lawyer who specializes in insurance settlements, is requested to take the case and serve as Abel's defense. The difficultly in the forthcoming legal battle is to ensure that Abel gets a fair trial, despite relations with Russian boiling like an unattended pot on a hot stove. Also during this time is the famous U-2 incident, where an American spy plane was shot down by Soviets and resulted in the death of Pilot Gary Powers (Austin Stowell). As a result, Donovan must now go to the USSR in order to try and sanction an exchange for Abel's safe return to his homeland for Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers), an economics professor who was arrested under suspicion of being a spy during the construction of the Berlin Wall.The first half of 'Bridge of Spies' is so quiet and low-key that it's almost a marvel of some sort. Spielberg further proves himself to be a delicate artist, with a gentle, liberal hand for long takes and intimate settings that build relationships with characters through tight, formal structures. Working with his longtime cinematographer Janusz Kamiński, Spielberg gives this film a classic-film look, almost echoing the dark and brooding sentiments of Hanks' overlooked 'Road to Perdition.' This film feels like a Cold War-era film about a forgotten piece of the era, thanks to its emphasis on classic set decoration and Spielberg's directorial artistry.The second half of 'Bridge of Spies,' however, opts for an approach more grounded in what you'd expect from this kind of a film: talky setups, moral conveniences, and a more linear A-to-B plot structure instead of the fascinating ambiguity and meditative qualities a Spielberg film like 'Lincoln' or 'Munich' maintained throughout their entire runtimes. During this latter half of the film - which admittedly doesn't cripple it - even with the film's scope extended to a more international level, we still zero in on the fine performance by Tom Hanks, who further proves that pairing him with Spielberg can almost do no wrong.Hanks plays a character conflicted because of oppressive times to the point where some may find it difficult to see 'the big deal' behind defending a Soviet spy on American soil. The moral ideas about following through with due process and a fair trial, while pretty standard and predictable for anyone who paid attention in law class, is still nonetheless a fascinating depiction of a film that is erected on difficult, weighty decisions by characters that always come with an accompanied 'but...' whenever they are audibly proposed. Probably the most underrated component of the film, however, is the relationship Hanks' Donovan has with Rylance's Abel. The two occupy a sort of respectful, father/son relationship with one another that makes their banter that much more believable, in addition to softly humorous in some respect. The film would've benefited from more of these simple scenes between two men caught in very difficult positions where a rulebook of any kind eludes them.The film was co-written by the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan, and in some ways, the more somber style of filmmaking makes this feel more like a Coen spectacle than a Spielberg film. However, it's the poetry communicated through Spielberg's directing that makes the film feel so fluid, in addition to the strong narrative that is given time to build over the course of nearly two and a half hours. All of these elements blended with some great, subtle period cinematography and a strong Hanks performance and you have a fascinating adult drama that, while not as layered as it could be, is an enriching experience.",8,2,5,19 October 2015
Little Miss Sunshine," Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right, where am I?
","Little Miss Sunshine is a salute to the heart and a feast for your soul that you can eat with your eyes. When I originally watched it back in 2007, I fell in love with it, and throughout repeated viewings (this is my fourth) it has held up better than a lot of mainstream comedies and other films that rely heavily on quirkiness and subtleties. This is a genuine, heartfelt excursion through the depressing event of life.We are taken into the Hoover household, a dysfunctional, disconnected band of social misfits. Greg Kinnear plays Richard, an aspiring motivational speaker, who continues to reference his theories about 'winners and losers,' while unintentionally browbeating his family. Sheryl (Collette) is the pro-honesty mother, continuously understanding and always bettering her children, but rarely talking about herself and her past and ambitions. Her brother Frank (Carrell) is a homosexual scholar who moves in with the family after his suicide attempt. Richard and Sheryl's children are Dwayne (Dano), Sheryl's from a previous marriage, who is currently partaking in a vow of silence until he can fulfill his dream of being a test pilot, and the spunky Olive (Breslin) who is breathlessly practicing her reclusive dance routine, coached by Richard's father Edwin (Arkin).With this lovable cast of champions, it's no wonder why the film's turnout is so heavenly. The plot gets going when Olive gets accepted into California's 'Little Miss Sunshine Beauty Pageant,' and the already lower-middle class family decides to take a bright yellow Volkswagen Microbus from their home in Albuquerque, New Mexico to the event. Along the way, the family becomes reconnected, sometimes hostile, but most of all enlightened about themselves and the people around them.These characters are so likable because they are imperfect. They are flawed, but not in the sense where dislike breeds contempt. The film is littered with poignant scenes, all across the board, and it's difficult not to spoil all of them. One of my favorites is when Dwayne discovers some life-changing news. Another takes place in a diner, another a confrontation between two men on a dock near the end of the film, and one of incorruptible happiness and optimism takes place in a motel room between Olive and her grandfather. It all leads up to that brilliant, unforgettable, amazingly-choreographed dance number that is so astonishing and satisfying you may have to watch it again.What makes the film work is its ability to, almost inadvertently, dodge sitcom clichés and cutesy sequences. This is a true film, not manipulated by a flowery script or blooming characters. This is a walk on the side of life we rarely partake in, and for once, it feels natural and authentic.The performances by actors of all different ages earn the title of 'career-worthy.' Steve Carrell is better here than he was in many of his comedy films, proving that many comedians can and will tackle a successful and promising drama role. Kinnear is wonderful as the closeted loser. Collette is a tad unsung, but the film does not overlook her at all. Abigail Breslin and Paul Dano are delightful, and Alan Arkin's one-liners cut through the cynicism so as not to overwhelm the viewer with depressed feelings as a form of guilt.This is a gem in every sense of the word. It reminds me much of Sam Mendes' stellar American Beauty. Both films involve dilapidated families. One is a satire, the other is purposely poignant. Both have a plethora of fantastic performances, a script to boot their subjects, and both sort of convey a similar message at the end. Little Miss Sunshine left me feeling content and satisfied, but also very upset for reasons I still can't comprehend. Perhaps it was the abundance of dark humor. The same feelings plagued me upon finishing American Beauty. They are wonderful films, but pack in an after-taste that is not bitter, nor sweet, but real. That's the keyword for both pictures.Starring: Greg Kinnear, Toni Collette, Steve Carell, Abigail Breslin, Paul Dano, and Alan Arkin. Directed by: Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris.",10,0,1,30 April 2012
Hugo," A cinematic achievement that embraces the medium and spills intelligence everywhere
","I don't think Martin Scorsese really cares if Hugo does well with audiences and at the box office. I think he's pleased with the end product and has successfully made an ode to cinema. Here's a man who has made one amazing film after another, and now he wants to pay tribute to a form of entertainment through the same form of entertainment. To put it simply; Hugo is a movie that loves movies.I did in fact read the novel, The Many Inventions of Hugo Cabret, by Brian Selznick which is why I was so worried about a film adaptation of the book. I knew it was coming, but how would they erect a film that is made up of mostly stunning pencil illustrations. Thankfully, the film fell into the hands of a director who knows the game of cinema inside and out and because of that he gives Hugo the stunning treatment it deserves. During the course of the film, we begin to see that this is clearly Scorsese's most personal film. Growing up in Little Italy, he was sheltered in his house because of his asthma. His mother would take him to the local movie theater, which lead to Scorsese's increasing fondness for cinema early on and eventually he made movies of all sorts.Hugo is a landmark for Scorsese for three reasons; the personal qualities, the 3D, and the target audience. This is Scorsese's first family film, and he shows that just like his traditional films, Hugo will appeal to some people, but not all. Reception will be divided amongst youngsters, but parents will be astounded when they see the milestone the film achieves.Set in 1930's Paris, Hugo (Butterfield) is a young boy who literally lives in the clocks of a hectic train station. On the ground floor are a number of regular people with hefty baggage. Emily Mortimer is the flower girl, Christopher Lee is the bookshop owner, and Frances de la Tour as Madame Emile is the cafe owner. Hugo's father died recently, and since then, his uncle has taken him to live at the train station.Hugo's uncle teaches him to take care of the clocks all around the station, winding them up, and keeping them in great shape before he disappears. Hugo must now stay out of trouble, and out of Inspector Gustav (Baron Cohen), the station manager's sight.Meanwhile, since Hugo's father died he has been trying to repair an old automaton which he believes has a message from his father. An automaton is a crafty machine, built to resemble a human being, that is programmed to write down a message if all the parts are in place. Hugo has stolen parts from a toy store in order to rebuild the automaton, but is caught one day by the owner Papa Georges (played exquisitely by Ben Kingsley) who burns his notebook containing instructions on rebuilding the figure. Hugo teams up with Georges' goddaughter Isabelle (Moretz) and the two go through an adventure trying to repair the figure, while Hugo shows Isabelle the beauty of cinema.That is another place where Scorsese's love for film comes into play and further cements the personal element of the film. Hugo shows Isabelle why cinema is so spellbinding and teaches her to appreciate it, like Scorsese has taught us with many of his films.This is a visually intelligent piece, and is one of cinema's greatest achievements of, not only the year, but of the new decade. The plot won't concern people who come for the brilliant visuals and the intelligent filmmaking. I will also go as far as to call this the best 3D film I have yet to see. Scorsese doesn't incorporate the medium as a gimmick, but as an enhancement to the world we are submersed in for two hours. Hugo is lit beautifully and astonishingly by glasses that usually drone out vibrant colors.Another thing to note is the professional camera-work, with Scorsese that shouldn't be a surprise, but it let it be said that when we talk about motions and camera-movement that Hugo handles it in such a way that needs to be seen to be believed. The opening shot glides us along the train station floor where we soon arc upwards, in a smooth as silk manner, to the big clock that occupies Hugo behind it. A similar shot can also be seen in the restaurant scene in Goodfellas.Performance-wise, again, the film scores big. We have a cast of elders, youngsters, and people of middle age. Everyone gives a performance worthy of recognition, especially young Asa Butterfield who looks like a miniature movie star.There are many shots of silent films, including a history lesson in very early filmmaking dating back to the early 1890's. This is where Hugo shines; resurrecting the past to give us, not just a rehash, but an unobtrusive look at the art form we're so well acquainted with in modern day society.Scorsese has yet made another masterpiece, without any conceivable flaws in sight. The camera-work is smooth, the visuals are intelligent, the dialog perfectly executed, the performances beautiful, and the 3D amazing. Hugo is a landmark for every field it sinks it steps on.Starring: Asa Butterfield, Chloë Grace Moretz, Ben Kingsley, Sacha Baron Cohen, Ray Winstone, Emily Mortimer, and Jude Law. Directed by: Martin Scorsese.",10,2,5,4 December 2011
American Beauty," Astronomically true to its title
","The moral and ethical simplicity of American Beauty is absolutely stunning seeing as it such a powerful and moving film. It is dark, yet it shines a light on the social misfits of America, those embodying a person they are dissatisfied with, and those feeling worthless or unwanted. It is a tragedy in some sense, but it is also a very poignant satire on the modern American suburbia. If you're one of the many misfits in the world, American Beauty is your shoutout.The plot is defined by the film's abundance of interesting and versatile characters, almost all of them stuck in a life they do not want to live. Our lead character is Lester Burnham (Spacey) a forty-two year old magazine writer, entering a midlife crisis and occupying an incorruptible hatred for his job and the ignorance possessed by his wife Carolyn (Bening) and daughter Jane (Birch). 'I'll be dead in a year' claims Lester in the first few moments of the film. 'In a way, I'm dead already' he will go on to say.Tired of the trite and ordinary life he is living, he gets a curveball when he meets Jane's best friend Angela (Suvari), an unrealistically attractive teenager, promiscuous and blunt in her dialect and fashion. Lester is shamelessly smitten with her upon their first encounter, and Angela knows it all too well. She treasures the idea that other men fantasize about having sex with her, despite having no prior relationship or knowledge. She feels it will only assist her career as a model. Pay close attention to the scene in the gymnasium. It is rather detailed and cinematically intelligent.In the meantime, Carolyn, a real-estate agent, has begun her rebellion by flirting and dancing with her main competition. Buddy Kane (Gallagher), a self-righteous, cocky man who gives her what her husband can't; safety, comfort, relaxation, and sex. A lot of it. Lester's rebellion starts when he quits his job and takes about eight steps down to the world of a fry-cook at a fast food joint. Jane's story of rebellion involves Ricky (Bentley), her neighbor who continues to videotape their interactions and spy on her persistently. At first, she is irritated, but begins to see Ricky for what he really is worth. He admires beauty in the way we all should. He sees simplicity as a treasure and feels it is taken for granted far too much. His upbringing has been rather heavy with an abusive bigot for a father and an uninvolved caricature for a mother. Not only is Ricky a passionate humanist and realist, but an avid drug dealer and pot smoker. There is a great scene in the film where him and Lester cut loose and smoke a joint together. This is where Lester's tale of rebellion and lawlessness comes into play.Over the years, American Beauty has been interpreted a number of different ways by a number of different people. It's almost as if the film occupies too much ambiguity, but it's subtle and reclusive in its efforts, making the film seem so basic and linear. I believe it is not only a tale of rebellion, but a tale of life appreciation and a reiteration of the moral 'Carpe diem.' Upon finishing the film, I was distinctly reminded of the quote from Ferris Bueller's Day Off 'Life moves pretty fast. You don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.' We are constantly rushed, hurried, and flustered everyday, we hardly appreciate the serene and intricate aspects life throws at us. 'Who has the time?' we might ask ourselves. American Beauty shows us it's the most simplistic things in life that are worth appreciating. Like a paper bag floating aimlessly in the air because of a modest wind gust. There is yet another wonderful shot in the film where Ricky is shooting a video through Jane's window. Angela is seductively dancing to taunt and satisfy him, but the camera zooms past her and in on a reflection of Jane's sad, lonely face. Rarely can a film accompany beautiful loneliness, but somehow, director Sam Mendes did in an earnest way, without being cheeky or bombastic. It's so crafty and subtle you may have missed it.Another moral I can find is the isolation and imprisonment many of the characters feel. In one scene, very early in the film, we see Lester masturbating, enclosed in the shower. 'It's the brightest part of my day' he states, but is it because he is providing himself with pleasure or because he's alone and safe? One shot I missed when watching the film was the scene where Lester's reflection in his computer screen looks as if he is imprisoned and sheltered from the real world. This is the part of American Beauty where it is keenly depressing. The three main emotions I felt during the film were happiness, depression, and vaguely present optimism. We already know the conclusion, but we can only hope we are wrong.American Beauty is exactly what it is. A beautiful, heartwarming drama, providing us with witty, affectionate characters, a slick script, and exquisite directing and cinematography (credited to the late Conrad L. Hall). It is a drama of integrity, appeal, intelligence, soul, and humanism. Why can't they all be this wonderful? Starring: Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari, Chris Cooper, and Allison Janney. Directed by: Sam Mendes.",10,0,2,20 April 2012
BASEketball," A Game Worth Playing
","BASEketball is a satisfying Comedy film by two creators of a certain animated show thats currently in it's fourteenth season. Why of course, Im speaking of Trey Parker and Matt Stone and their creation of the controversial television series, South Park. They star in one of the few actually acting films they did that is pretty much forgotten about. Its a very good Comedy and from the kind of humor in this Im upset they didn't do more acting Comedy films. Seeing them come back nowadays would be a miracle since if one looked at their filmography the only thing they've been doing for a while now is strictly South Park. Anything else is minor cameos.Buddy movies are what I love. Two or three friends, hanging out, getting into fights, antics, and anything that involves them somehow finding humor is what I love. Half of the movies on my list of favorites are dynamic duo, buddy movies. Clerks, Black Sheep, Tremors, License to Drive, Joy Ride, etc. They're enjoyable movies. Especially when the characters are close to home. Thats what tops it off.Trey Parker and Matt Stone plays Remer and Cooper, underachieving slackers whom shoot for nothing that involves work. After being challenged at a party to a Basketball game, they come up with a game on the spot called 'Baseketball', an obvious pun on Basketball and Baseball. The movie then cuts five years later where Remer, Cooper, their friend nicknamed 'Squeak' (Dian Bachar) for his notably short size, and numerous other guys have formed a Baseketball team called the 'Milwaukee Beers', parody of the Brewers. After the manager dies choking, the team is now in the hands of Cooper who is shy and scared to do anything to change it causing much dismay Remer, Squeak, and the remaining teams. The team's quest is to win the 'Denslow Cup', the biggest title in Baseketball.I always loved the work of Parker and Stone. They prove to be a witty and clever duo in this forgotten movie. The movie throws in various counts of humor assuring audiences never come close to boredom. Definitely one to check out. Only wish DVD included all the deleted scenes from the VHS release.Not too much to say about this then it's just a great Comedy movie. This is the kind of Comedy the 90s were all about. Two slackers sums up the plot who amount to something much greater than themselves. You can basically name 'Two slackers' under every Comedy in the 90s. Clerks, Black Sheep and so on. Very good Comedy right here, very well done humor, some jokes overdone, but well done at the same time. Decent cameo made by Jenny McCarthny as well.Starring: Trey Parker, Matt Stone, Dian Bachar, and Jenny McCarthny. Directed by: David Zucker.",8,2,2,13 August 2010
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," Escaping, crashing, or vacationing, it's still a good time
","Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa? After watching the film, something about the title, when you say it, doesn't sound right. Even if you've read the plot, the title doesn't make too much sense. The plot involves Alex the lion (voiced by Ben Stiller), Marty the zebra (Chris Rock), Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melmen the giraffe (David Schwimmer) as they wind up fleeing the country of Madagascar in the very beginning of the film in a junkyard plane, flown by the pesky penguins, with hopes of reaching New York City. They crash-land in Africa, with no intentions of escaping to there. I guess they wanted to find a way to employ a title of uniqueness.No bother. It's not a huge distraction. Especially considering that the film is a notable improvement from its predecessor. Sometime during the three year break between Madagascar and its sequel, the brewing franchise found direction, hope, and audacity and created a sequel effectively better than the first - a rare quality indeed.Continuing on with the plot, the film opens with nice backstory showcasing how Alex, whose birth name was apparently 'Alakay,' was born in Africa to two loving parents. His father was Zuba, the alpha lion of the entire land. He turns his back for a few seconds, and Alex is lured to a group of animal poachers and is crated up and taken away. Zuba chases after him with no luck, and Alex's crate doesn't survive a rocky turn, catapulting him into a river. He floats to New York City, is greeted with open arms, and is quickly put into the Central Park Zoo where he will obtain a loyal following of fans. Despite being very dark and somewhat depressing, the elegance of it all sort of gives the picture a Lion King style quality I was not expecting.Then the whole ordeal with the planned flight, intriguing plane crash, and acceptance of being stranded again takes place, before we finally get something else delightfully unexpected; the characters separating. In the original Madagascar, the four animals stuck like clue. In this picture, they go off on their own for a good chunk of the film and sort of evolve into believable animals. The whole quality of the animals sounding like actors and not like their own individual self? Still present, but hidden behind the depth of the storytelling. Alex catches up with his father and mother, Marty desperately seeks confidence in his originality, Gloria finds a plump man, and Melmen becomes the 'alpha-doctor?' and frets over confessing his love to Gloria; one of the many sweet love stories the film brings. There is also the obligatory evil character Makunga (Alec Baldwin), Zuba's rival lion, who adds some nicely placed tension to the film whenever he comes on screen. And even King Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen) returns to provide some nice humor.And did I forget to mention those four troublesome penguins? They get much deserved screen time in the picture, providing levels of insight and wittiness complimented by the film's overall narrative, which is more controlled and well-kept rather than so kinetic, jumbled, and anarchic. Is Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa on the same level as a Pixar film? No, but it works as a welcomed rebellion to the company. It sort of reminds me of how in decades past, animation films were theoretically monopolized by Disney, and few films (I can think of Bebe's Kids and Cats Don't Dance) challenged that assumption and ventured out to create their own world. Madagascar's sequel shows its sentimental side I was asking for during the original film. It's a balancing act of humor, sentimentality, and creativity, and is all captured pleasantly.Voiced by: Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett Smith, David Schwimmer, Sacha Baron Cohen, and Alec Baldwin.

Salt," Salt Brings the Pepper and Spice to Make this Film Nice
","he Bourne Identity and Salt need to team up and have lunch when not on the run. They really have a connection and are in a similar movie just replaced genders. Salt is one of the better thrillers of 2010 and is not a movie that goes ape with twists and turns. It has a couple here and there but really its just a typical thriller. Its a movie that has fun with itself and thats something I look for in movies like this. A movie that can enjoy itself which can get dialogue when needed and give decent action sequences.Angelina Jolie has never been an actress I followed with passion. If something came out that had an interest level that was higher than expected with her, Id see it. But in retrospect I haven't seen more than three things with her name on it. Salt is one Im glad I did check out because I was debating Inception beforehand. Ill see it at one point, but I was looking for some slim and slender Jolie to satisfy. Rather blonde, black haired, or with a tomboyish cut, shes attractive.The plot involves Evelyn Salt (Jolie) a CIA agent who is recently uncovered by Orlov who reveals the plans of Russians who want to bring all hell to the United States. When Salt is said to be involved a brainscan is conducted on the man and hes telling the truth. The agent co-workers go on a spree looking for her and want to catch her as soon as possible. The action begins as we see Salt jump out of windows jump out of moving cars, run through traffic, tase cops, and so on. The action gets redundant, but after the CIA jargon scenes you want some mind numbing scenes.Salt has it's share of flaws. To begin with, like James Bond and the Bourne series the film has a lot of punching, slapping, and hitting in it. Which is fine, but almost no blood is seen, at least not that I noticed. Now, I don't want one punch to make the face explode in gore, but some blood dripping from cuts would be realistic enough. Im sick of watching action movies that that don't involve blood. We are supposed to believe a kick to the face leaves no blood? Also, its a shame that this film got cut to a PG-13 rating. If we got an R rating we could have perhaps seen blood, maybe some cutting, a sex scene or two? But for some reason, this had to be cut to a PG-13 rating. Honestly, I don't understand toning a movie down. Most notably Prom Night for being a PG-13 slasher film. Thats no excuse, no reason a slasher movie should be cut back to PG-13. Though, I must say, Salt impressed me and left me hoping for a sequel. After all, its not too late to get Matt Damon in Salt 2.Starring: Angelina Jolie, Liev Schreiber, and Chiwetel Ejiofor.

Duck Soup," Dated, yes. Humor-wise, absolutely not.
","'Take two turkeys, one goose, four cabbages, but no duck, and mix them together. After one taste, you'll duck soup for the rest of your life.' - Groucho Marx's explanation for the title of Duck Soup.Duck Soup is an unprecedented comedy of wit and satire, with its range of material and jokes reaching a rare amount of diversity. The film is short, whimsical, and delightfully anarchic at only sixty-eight minutes, and it seems after every ten minutes you need a break to sometimes decipher what just happened. Things progress at a rapid fire pace, and the end feels like about twenty-five minutes or so got lost in a blaze.This sounds like how I'd comment on a bad film, but Duck Soup uses these tactics in its favor. Its main benefit is that the brothers wanted to do nothing more than make an enjoyable comedy, but they accidentally succeeded in making one of the most cynical and brutally honest political satires in a blue moon. It's very rare that I award a comedy a perfect rating, but Duck Soup has proved to be more than meets the eye in substance, character-acting, and overall, look and feel.We are placed in the country of Freedonia, a small, corrupt, and bankrupt place that has struggled politically for many years. Mrs. Teasdale (Dumont) suggest they appoint Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho) as the leader of the country, and see if he can get the country back on the route of prosperity. It's clear that his plans are radical, unsustainable, and virtually outlandish. The funny part is no one sees it that way. He says that anyone chewing gum will be pursued, and despite how absurd that idea is, no one scolds him. They are too smitten with his sunny and kind-hearted disposition. Perhaps that's how we are as people.While this is in the mix, the neighboring country of Sylvania has been itching to take over the land of Freedonia, and the Sylvanian ambassador Trentino (Calhern) attempts to destroy the country bit by bit by hiring two spies to dig up dirt on Firefly, and further tries to implement and carry on with a revolution. The spies he appoints, Chicolini (Chico) and Pinky (Harpo), are incompetent buffoons who wind up being unnecessary roadblocks and distractions, bringing trouble wherever they show up. This results in a never-ending slew of comedic possibilities, all working in the film's favor.Next to Rufus, the funniest character is Chicolini, the silent half of the spy duo, who appears in some of the film's most enjoyable segments. There are a number of scenes where Chicolini and Pinky obnoxiously harass a poor street vendor who wants nothing but a successful business. This results in the infamous scene where the three tirelessly exchange hats, and where Chicolini jumps into and rides the bucket of lemonade like a bicycle, disgusting the vendors' customers. The scene is simply hilarious, and I can't recall laughing harder to a scene in a comedy in recent years.But what makes Chicolini's character avoid insufferable schtick is his ability to perform physical comedy. His facial expressions are simply entrancing and his antics on par with his explosive personality. He's almost like Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean, but more shameless and rowdy. Chicolini has an intense and infectious form of likability, and he never comes off as a nuisance.Duck Soup was released in 1933, and was met with less than stellar box office numbers, causing Paramount to drop The Marx Brothers, among other issues. The most likely reason it took in a low amount of revenue is because of the subject matter. The film is highly cynical, sarcastic, and unapologetically rude. America was hitting the time of The Great Depression, among the beginning stages of World War II. It goes to show that people weren't interested in seeing a cheeky, satirical portrayal of government and politics. Thankfully, the film has gotten its proper respect over the years, and is often hailed as The Marx Brothers' best film.I also wouldn't hesitate to bill this as one of the funniest and smartest comedy films ever made. At least on my personal list. The film tackles a number of subjects, from politics, imperialism, government, outlandish rules, and society itself, and satirizes them to the point of utter disbelief and hilarity. In no way is the film mean-spirited or deliberately crude. This was before that became the standard in comedy. It always keeps a sunny, cheery disposition, right down to the final frame. Its bravery is astonishing, even to this day. How often do we see comedies tackle difficult subjects, let alone with so much confidence, power, and pride, never becoming indulgent, cocky, or simply crass and ignorant? This is comedic and satirical filmmaking at its absolute finest. The Marx Brothers are clearly a treasure, under-appreciated in this day and age, and painfully overlooked in a time where politics and social issues plague our nation. Duck Soup is slapstick done right, with a great band of character actors, one-liners galore, and a simple and effective premise that goes very far, surpassing anyone's expectations of 'another stupid comedy from the year one.' NOTE: It's also interesting to note that Groucho goes on record saying that him and his three brothers were just 'Jews trying to get laughs.' He denies that the film covered the topics of government and politics purposefully, and that he believes people read too much into it. I guess I'll reword my previous question like so; 'How often do we see comedies tackle difficult subjects, let alone with so much confidence, power, and pride, never becoming indulgent, cocky, or simply crass and ignorant? And they don't even try?' Starring: Groucho Marx, Harpo Marx, Chico Marx, Zeppo Marx, Margaret Dumont, Louis Calhern, Raquel Torres, and Edgar Kennedy. Directed by: Leo McCarey.",10,0,1,1 April 2012
Disturbia," It's like the darkness is the light
","Here's a teen thriller that isn't fueled by raging teenager hormones and doesn't act on impulse during tense situations. Well, most of the time. Disturbia is a crafty and intense thriller that may not pack in the originality of other films of the same genre, but has enough to effectively sustain its runtime and its ideas. Although not perfectly executed, it finds little shortcuts around some clichés, but still offers essentially the same things you'd get in a regular 2000's decade horror film.This is a treat for Shia LaBeouf and his fans as well. Finally we can see him in a film with coherency, plot, and characterization. He finally shows his acting talents that do not involve running away from metal giants and screaming at them with full power. He is more controlled, and more developed in Disturbia, leaving much to be desired. He plays Kale, who was just in a car accident that killed his father, and has been placed on house arrest after punching his Spanish teacher. He's been throughout a lot, and is the typical teenager that likes music, TV, and girls, so we can still see he isn't a bad kid, but a victim of somewhat uncontrollable circumstances.In a random act of boredom, he starts spying on his neighbors which include deviant little kids, a gorgeous young woman (Roemer), a cheating couple, and a mysterious elder, played wonderfully by David Morse. He becomes more acquainted with the young woman, whose name is Ashley, and they begin spying on the elderly man, who they believe might match a killer who has been kidnapping women across town.LaBeouf and Roemer strike up a believable chemistry, and the film isn't too much sex, too much cartoony violence, or too much blood. It's all well managed. The film takes about an hour before it kicks itself into high gear, so these characters are left to develop at an efficient rate. The result works favorably, and when hell starts breaking loose, we feel even more sorry for the characters because we know them well. They're not faceless caricatures.As some could pick up from the plot, this is a modern retelling of Hitchcock's classic Rear Window, now updated with computers, cell phones, and cameras. I'm not for remakes, but I am somewhat for reimaginings and updated versions of films from decades past. As long as they're made with suspense, characters, coherency, and enjoyment. Here, there's respect for Hitchcock's original story, but there are also touches of the film's own personal take on the story. Because of these alterations, the films can't be dubbed as a remake, but a reimagining.Disturbia is a fine blend of terror, voyeurism, and suspense with good looking teen actors who are bound to do well in the future. Once LaBeouf ceases with the Transformers films, and Aaron Yoo wanders out of remake hell I can see both of them doing films of all different genres. Hopefully they'll put the binoculars away next time and go out and play.Starring: Shia LaBeouf, Sarah Roemer, Aaron Yoo, David Morse. Directed by: D.J. Caruso.",8,1,2,25 February 2012
Edward Scissorhands," Burton's unrefined, unmatched masterwork
","Tim Burton has an easy time creating sets and atmospheres that spring right from the bowels of his imagination, but he often has a more difficult time humanizing the eccentricities of his specific creations. With Edward Scissorhands that problem doesn't exist. Burton has successfully created his most personal story yet, combining true human emotion with characters that at first seem to be basic parodies of themselves. This kind of approach could've been fluffy and condescending, but Burton and screenwriter Caroline Thompson's maturity prevails over all.The film tells the story of Edward (Johnny Depp), a young boy who lives in a mountaintop Gothic mansion with the man who invented him. However, because the inventor died before giving Edward a pair of hands, Edward has hands that are long, metal, and sharp, rendering him as forever incomplete or unfinished. Far below the mountaintop is pure-whitebread surburbia, where everything is plain and colorful. It's a miraculous look in the way of set-design and architecture. One day, a local Avon representative named Peg Boggs (Dianne Wiest) is traveling through the neighborhood and ventures up the mountaintop to solicit to whoever is living there. When she finds Edward, shy, pale, and lonesome, she takes him home to live with her husband and two children so that he can have the feeling of a real family.Edward is clearly an outcast in this suburban wonderland, until he discovers that he has a talent for hedge-trimming and yardwork thanks to his scissor-hands. He makes something of a hobby going around the neighborhood and cutting everyone's hedges into a beautiful sculpture. But when Edward finally meets Peg's beautiful daughter Kim (Winona Ryder), he begins to have feelings far beyond any he has ever had before. It's unfortunate, however, that Kim is dating Jim (Anthony Michael Hall), a narcissistic and hopelessly arrogant man who belittles Edward despite his charm and kind-spirits.Johnny Depp is likely the only person who could play Edward Scissorhands to the full extent, without channeling self-parody or unnecessary childishness. Depp is one of the only actors working today who chooses many 'one of a kind' roles, meaning he can't go back to older films to see how another person played a character. And if even he could, like with Burton's later film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, he still infuses so much creativity and personal-preference into the character that any shred of a carbon-copy is unrecognizable. Depp gives Edward enough leverage emotionally and personally to make him likable and a worthy protagonist.Winona Ryder works extremely well in the picture as well, working far beyond any pretty-girl notion that one would suspect from someone like her. There is a masterful scene in the film where Edward is sculpting a giant statue out of ice, shredding it at rapid speed, causing light flaky-snow to fall down. It is the first time the suburban neighborhood has seen snow or anything like it and right below Edward is Kim, basking in the falling snow as majestically as a teen girl could. The scene is warm and presents one of the nicest films in any film Burton has done.But ultimately, the themes of discovery, isolation, conformity, and ignorance take full presence in Edward Scissorhands. The character of Edward is a perfect one, indeed, and the setting for the story - a plastic suburban village - is perfect as well for a story like this to be told. Suburban areas are often conducted in a certain fashion, where everything is done a specific, orderly way and no questions are asked. There's little room for difference mainly because the elements of predictability and control are so heavily capitalized. The character of Edward shows an initial suburban area's reaction to a harmless, but different character, who proudly refuses conformity and a melting-pot lifestyle simply by getting by with what he has. While stories emphasizing originality and uniqueness aren't uncommon in movies, it's stunning to see a story like this portrayed in mainstream cinema so boldly, emotionally, and effectively. The case of conformism and being your own person is amplified so differently here just by the choice of character and supporting characters that it creates an astonishingly working blend of craft.Edward Scissorhands is, in fact, Burton's masterwork, clearly personal, richly detailed, and aesthetically beautiful in many regards.Starring: Johnny Depp, Winona Ryder, Dianne Weist, and Anthony Michael Hall.

Silver Linings Playbook," It's self-aware but never smug
","It seems over the years that all romantic comedies have been stamped with the rather dishonest label of 'chick flicks' due to their fluffy nature and their schmaltzy screenplays that seem to cater only to the needs of day-dreaming women that are looking for ninety minutes of simple escapism. Not Silver Linings Playbook. This is a serious and simultaneously entertaining romantic comedy that doesn't substitute antics for characters or reality for humor.History teacher Paul Solitano (Bradley Cooper) has just been discharged from a mental hospital and can no return home to his parents' home after he catches his wife in the act of infidelity eight months ago and completely lost it. He learns that his father (Robert De Niro) is out of work, and making money off high-stakes gambling on the Philadelphia Eagles, and his wife has moved away and gotten a restraining order against him. Paul must now begin the time-consuming task of rebuilding his life and repair surrounding relationships in his life that have no been dismantled because of his bipolar disorder.Paul winds up meet his friend's wife's sister Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence), who has been going through the pain of losing her husband and then committing random sex acts down at her workplace. Meeting each other, we can see they strike immediate chemistry, but their personal albatrosses, Paul with his ongoing devotion to finding his wife, and Tiffany with her inability to keep consistent with her behavior and emotions roadblock them into forming a solid, sustainable relationship together.After spending enough time together, Tiffany reveals to Paul that she could deliver a letter written by him to Nikki and be the messenger between them if he agrees to be her partner in a dance competition. One of the several subplots, which is handled mainly in the final half of the film, is Paul and Tiffany trying to make a bet on a dance competition and a football game work out in Paul's father's favor, as he is facing impending financial trouble with another gambler, and another one involves Paul's father's OCD and superstitions to try and make the Eagles win games. With all this madness and little sub-plots thrown into the blender, you wouldn't believe that they work in unison.The catch is they do and they do so in a method I can only relate to writer/director Alexander Payne and his barrage of delightful human comedies such as About Schmidt, Sideways, and most recently The Descendants. Payne constructs his characters with layers, making them relatable and easy to like, and writer/director David O. Russell (2010's Academy Award winning The Fighter) follows the same blueprint for success.It also came to my attention that this picture further leads Bradley Cooper down the path of an A-list actor. His role in The Hangover is miles away from this one, and his character Paul is far off anything he's ever done, yet it seems he was born to play the role of a conflicted men who isn't all there from a mental standpoint. After coming off of the disappointing Hunger Games and the pathetic House at the End of the Street, I feared Jennifer Lawrence was on a path to mediocrity, but it took me about five minutes of her on screen before those two films slipped my mind. She embodies Tiffany in such a divine, confident way I was sure that she will continue to do more great things along this line of work. She is too not falling prey to the typical child-star Disney conventions, where young, mostly female actresses pick G and PG rated pictures that do not test them at all as people or character actors. Lawrence seems to be too good for that schlock. And it must be said as well that Robert De Niro, after a string of dismissible performances, has finally found his second calling in the film industry aside from breakneck mobster features and that is the sly, humorous father figure that is desperately trying to keep his troubled son close.Both Pat and Tiffany wind up having some sort of complex, emotional outburst that affects them massively and the people around them also. Both sequences aren't played for laughs, but for complete seriousness which works in favor of the idea that Russell is not playing for cheap laughs but for respect for those with mental illnesses. Even in his sequences, Chris Tucker, noted comedian and actor that can take a light setup and drum it into something completely silly, is portrayed in a sincere light and is not offered up as the butt of the joke or a lame-brained, obnoxious best friend to reiterate everything Pat says (unlike Kevin Hart's role in Think Like a Man). Silver Linings Playbook is a simple, endearing exercise that is along the same line as Safety Not Guaranteed, in the idea that it's quirky and self-aware, but it has more to offer than stale fodder that passes for uniqueness.Starring: Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Jacki Weaver, Robert De Niro, and Chris Tucker. Directed by: David O. Russell.",8,2,4,2 December 2012
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," A film that defies all criticism and the reviewing process
","Does a film titled 'Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters' even need a review to correspond with the finished product? Do the fundamentals and guidelines of film criticism/analysis even apply to such a film? This film defies the medium and all it stands for. It exists in that small little blackhole of cinema, where films that are close to 'unreviewable' lie. Alongside films like this one are parody films, theatrical stand-up comedy releases, and some obscure others.Is there even a reason to explain the plot of Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters? I might as well. The film takes place in Augsburg, where the Mayor of the town hires the brother and sister duo Hansel and Gretel (Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton) to find and kill any witches they may find. Hansel, armed with his trusty shotgun and his syringes for his insulin shots, and Gretel, with her wits and bow-and-arrow, along with this hideous troll monster, they set out to find and eliminate the witches from the forests of the city.One of the first things noticeable about this tepid reworking of the classic fairytale is how grim and dingy the entire event is. I think the problem lies in the fact that the material is taken in a serious manner, rather than being campier and more alive than it should be. The same direction was taken for Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, a picture that was almost relentless in its bleakness and charmless ways.Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters, however, doesn't have two or three good scenes that buoy the entire project like the aforementioned film did. Instead, this is one depressing slog due to the material not being that interesting and the entire setup not being that creative. The set designs are probably the most impressive thing to look at here. They're a cross between Tim Burton and Timur Bekmambetov, with more emphasis on Gothic undertones. It's too bad that the sets aren't used as much but scenic backdrops, and Hansel and Gretel are left mainly with their wits and their artillery. There is little room for improvisation, even when you're being hunted by obscure beasts. There's also little room for personality, as the title characters are nothing more than sulky, faceless characters we root for because we are expected to. They offer nothing in the way of emotion or character; they might as well have cutouts around their face that say 'Insert Face Here.' This is certainly not my kind of film. I think predominately because I see something like this as an obligation on part of the crew rather than a serious movie. Jeremy Renner, who has been on a role with Hollywood films, seemingly needs to keep doing these kinds of films so every once in a while he can take a risk like he did with The Hurt Locker. A few years prior to this film, writer/director Tommy Wirkola made a film about Nazi-zombies called Dead Snow, which was more fun to explain than to actually watch. Regardless, I'd rather see a goofy little surprise like that film more often than one about classic fairytale characters acting like two archetypal action heroes.I'm constantly told that I look at films too deeply and, instead of being cynical and expect a masterpiece every time I see a film, I should look at a film as a piece of entertainment. To much surprise, I actually do. What I find entertaining and worthy of my money and what I look for in a film is drastically different from what a lot of others will look for. Rather than guttural smugness from an action film, I'd appreciate character and excitement. Rather than haphazard plot-developments, I'd prefer explanations and detail. And rather than senseless camaraderie, Id' like clarity and vision.That's about as far as I'll go in my analysis. Was the film good? Does it need to have a star rating? Who knows? I'm giving it two stars, as that's halfway between good and dreadful. You should already know if you're in the target audience to see this kind of a picture. However, there was not much of a justification for seeing the film in theaters, or paying its ludicrous surcharge for the plastic 3D glasses that dim the picture and make the high-quality camera used to shoot the film look like it has dirty plastic wrap over the lens.Starring: Jeremy Renner, Gemma Arterton, Famke Janssen, and Peter Stormare.

Spider-Man," One of the most ecstatic superhero events in quite some time
","Peter Parker is the awkward, neurotic, socially inept teenager, interested in photography, and crushing on the prettiest girl in school, Mary Jane Watson. During his trip to a genetics laboratory, where the class learns all about genetically altered spiders, Peter is bit on the hand by one of the arachnids that escaped and slowly begins to possess powers beyond his wildest dreams. At first, he realizes he can see without the help of his glasses, next, he notices he can leap heights and flip to great lengths, and finally, he starts to acquire the ability to stick to walls and shoot webs out of his hands.He becomes the notorious and infamous, Spider-Man, where he has proved to be a burden to some, but a hero to others in his hometown of New York City, where he lives with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris). After his Uncle Ben is shot and killed during a robbery, Peter notices the city is nothing but scum and is determined to take down the cities' worst in the form of secrecy. Meanwhile, his close friend, Harry's (James Franco) father, Dr. Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) is the president of the Oscorp manufacturing corporation, where they make and supply weaponry to the United States Army. In the mix of it all, Osborn becomes, what newspaper editor J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) dubs, the 'Green Goblin' who pilots a glider, and serves as the villain to Spider-Man's hero.What inevitably follows is a series of unplanned and very physical battle scenes taking place with the backdrop of New York City skylines to handle it all. There's also a subplot, involving Peter, played effortlessly well by Tobey Maguire, trying to impress Mary Jane, played by the talented and attractive Kirsten Dunst, by relentlessly saving her from calamity and trouble by sweeping in at the nick-of-time while she is either being held captive by the Goblin, intimidated by muggers or even falling to her death. The catch is Mary Jane doesn't know this is Peter, but on the side, she talks to him at various points in the film. They've lived next to each other for years, but Peter has always viewed her as the unachievable girl next door and Mary Jane has probably always found Peter to be the unfortunate geek next door. How she doesn't recognize his voice when 'Spider-Man' saves her an astronomical three times is beyond me. She should probably stick to staying in doors.No bother. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man is a fascinating and entertaining work of superhero fiction, collectively doing Marvel and all of its actors justice by blessing them with good material, a straight-shooting script, and action sequences that don't fail to impress. The kinetics and craft of it all are through the roof, and the twenty-five+ years the picture spent in development clearly was for the best. The film spends the first hour or so getting us acquainted with the man behind the mask, much like the original Marvel comics. We see Parker as a human, not an action figure, occupying a mask of uniqueness and power. The film shows the geek in the beginning, sympathetically, and then goes on to showcase him powerfully, where he is a placed in a role of certainty and bravery.Marvel comics were notorious for paying attention to the character behind the mask and the character in the mask. One thing Spider-Man neglects to showcase in its script and its main character is the agony and pain of it all. The second Marvel feature in 2003, Ang Lee's unfairly bashed Hulk, did a much better job at showing how a superhero's powers were more of a belligerent curse than a stroke of luck in a world of bitterness. Stan Lee infused his comics with so much life and enigma for the characters, plot progression, and the color of it all that the challenge to adapt it to film is definitely there. Raimi handles it appropriately and maturely, not becoming sidetracked with monotonous melodrama or overly-cutesy action sequences.The ones he does bring to the table are kinetic and stylish, showing off some of the most impressive photography and visual work of the year 2002, and brings two charismatic actors along for the ride. Spider-Man may not have the excruciating depth of Hulk, which created more cons than pros in the job of a superhero, along with establishing a sincere yet distant father and son relationship, but in its own right, it does so much in its two hours that you may need to stop for a breather.Starring: Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, Rosemary Harris, and J. K. Simmons. Directed by: Sam Raimi.",8,5,7,2 July 2012
The Intouchables," Defines 'wholesomeness' and then some
","Now here is a film that perfect defines the word 'wholesomeness.' The Intouchables is a moving parable about a wise but poor black man who becomes the caregiver and mentor for a wealthy tetraplegic in a series of unlikely but not unbelievable events in modern-day France. The film begins by showing the man's assistant, interviewing candidates for the job of being the man's hands and legs, but as the man sits close behind her, he becomes increasingly unsatisfied with the candidates due to their lack of motivation or their mundane nature.The man, named Philippe, played by François Cluzet, is brought to a smile when he is acquainted with Driss (Omar Sy), a man who has been through relentless struggles with money and social-status, but still manages to push through it with a smile. Driss is only looking for a signature on his unemployment checks so he can continue receiving welfare benefits and has absolutely no ambition to get this job.The next day, he is called up to begin the trial period as the role of Philippe's caretaker, and while Driss is clearly unqualified for a job of this nature, Philippe casually accepts him because he finds the man to be charming and good-natured. While both men come from the Parisian-area, Philippe lives in a heavenly mansion, while Driss inhabits the lowest end of the slums. Despite this setback, the men have an incredibly easy-going friendship, with deep, touching talks of inspiration and motivation throughout the picture. Subplots involve Driss demanding that Philippe maintain better control of his only daughter, Elisa, and trying to get the man back on his dating game with a digital lover.I'm aware the story sounds like cliché-after-cliché, but the film perfectly abides by my law of films with a seemingly cliché premise. The Intouchables knows its story functions with moments of incredulity and utter sappiness, but it doesn't try to overcompensate and milk those moments for more than they're worth. It also does more than give us contrivance, but inflates its moments of sentiment with wit, charm, attitude, style, and poignancy, making this for a very emotional experience on every level. Sometimes, we are greeted with a film we know is relatively simple, cliché, and unassuming, yet we are mesmerized unconditionally up until the final frame.The film became a colossal hit in France, selling over nineteen million tickets and is currently the second highest grossing film of all time, in France. Due to its very minimal promotion in the US, I could see some people going into this film expecting a somber, relatively monotone film depicting the life of a tetraplegic tragically and with a numbing aftertaste. The Intouchables has a talent much like the Alexander Payne film, The Descendants, which is depicting a relaxing environment, which includes making a character out of the setting, handling tragedy with a sustainable amount of poignancy, and providing touches of extremely funny comedy throughout its entire runtime.As of now, French cinema is one of the strongest cinemas in the world, as it has been for decades now. Rather than try to recreate the New Wave it experienced many years ago, try out a gimmicky, self-indulgent style, or even worse, replicate Hollywood formulas, it is at a stage now where it can take even the most basic storyline and rework it into a magnificent portrayal with humanity and lavishness subtly and majestically. The Intouchables is a beauty that will definitely be taken for granted.Starring: François Cluzet and Omar Sy. Directed by: Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano.",10,8,15,31 July 2012
Bad Teacher," I think I'll be excused
","Bad Teacher is a hit and miss comedy, with a fair number of laughs, but a fair number of plot holes and questions. Before I even thought about this movie after seeing it, I went and watched Bad Santa for the first time. Both films have a similar premise with the lead character being unpleasant and offensive. But Bad Santa was written with a more style of dark comedy, and let's not forget, with a corrupt childhood and a 'whatever' attitude, Billy Bob Thornton's character had a perfectly good reason to be 'bad' and mean. Cameron Diaz has none other than she is just mean-spirited and has chosen to pursue a miserable lifestyle.Elizabeth Halsey is our main character, portrayed by the lovely Cameron Diaz. Elizabeth is a teacher had a normal school, and comes home one day to her fiancée and finds out that his mother has convinced him to call of the wedding. Planning to possibly spend the rest of her life staying at home since her fiancée was rich, Elizabeth must return to the school where she shows her class movies every day while she naps at her desk.Seeing the attractive substitute teacher Scott Delacorte (Timberlake), Elizabeth makes conversation to learn he has just gone through a breakup with a woman with large breasts. Elizabeth decides to under-go a breast enlargement surgery, a costly but rewarding surgery, to be more self-appreciative.The main rival in the film is Amy Squirrel (Punch), another teacher in the building. She believes that Elizabeth is a fraud, scamming the school out of money (to pay for her surgery). There is also a strange attraction between Jason Segel's character as the gym teacher. The movie's biggest fault is it focuses more on Elizabeth's sometimes funny, sometimes not antics instead of building up the attraction it should with Jason Segel's character. When the film ends, we feel that the film itself didn't know how to end and just thought up something out of the blue just to give the film some sort of sun-shiny ending. The end would've been better, if we got more of a relationship between the two.Another problem is that the students are never developed enough. The film has several students that speak to Miss Halsey individually, but it seems it can't make up its mind which one it wants to focus on. We have the brown nose girl and the sensitive kid who writes poetry and is crushing on the girl way out of his league. We get brief scenes with them, but we never see Elizabeth talk to one of the students very much. In Bad Santa, Thornton was always talking to kids and, despite his sour motivation, he was optimistic about the loner he picked up along the way.The backstory isn't big either. If Cameron Diaz is such a miserable hack behind the desk, why did she take up teaching in the first place? How did she become a teacher? Does the principal never come in the classroom to find that Elizabeth is sleeping while the kids watch Scream? While I liked Diaz in There's Something About Mary and other things she has done, in this, she is just barely likable.The jokes are funny. But boy does the writing fail it. When the jokes are funny, they are really funny. When the jokes fail, they fall flat on their face and are cringe inducing. The dry humping scene between Diaz and Timberlake is awkward, and is useless. It doesn't cause any advance in the plot or accomplishment among Diaz's part. It's simply there to have some sort of sex scene in a movie titled Bad Teacher.Bad Teacher is cute, but ultimately not as dirty or as funny as it should be. The relationship between the characters is forced, no one on screen seems to be doing their best, and the screenplay, like I said, can be good but can really bad. A comedy that had potential, also had a really good movie it would be compared to for its lifetime. The result; Santa will live on while the Teacher will need an attitude adjustment.Starring: Cameron Diaz, Jason Segel, and Justin Timberlake. Directed by: Jake Kasdan.",5,10,19,3 July 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man," Webb's webs are artificial, yet are they more real?
","The looming question many people should have when entering The Amazing Spider-Man is was it justified to reboot a series that's original film turns ten this very year? Entering the film and hearing about it throughout the course of the past two years, I thought the idea was undeniably foolish. A reboot's purpose, in my eyes, is to introduce a character audiences have likely forgotten about, or have not been properly acquainted with. The recent Captain America film was justified by two reasons; the upcoming Avengers film and the fact that audiences are likely not wholly familiar with his story.Today, even after seeing The Amazing Spider-Man, I believe the idea of starting a whole new series is a foolish idea with only money in mind. I fear that this review will quickly turn into a list, as I am planning to compare/contrast this with Raimi's original Spider-Man film, a rarely credited, well done superhero film.As far the story goes, the idea hasn't changed too much, but the Green Goblin has been traded for 'The Lizard' and the love interest is no longer Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane but Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy. The origin-story of Peter Parker hasn't changed much either. After going to a genetics laboratory, sneaking in for that matter, he is bitten on the neck by a spider and starts to encounter strange symptoms, beginning with catlike reflexes and, finally, with sticky hands and the ability to leap and jump higher than imaginable.After Parker's uncle is shot and killed (played by Martin Sheen in a very convincing role), he decides to use his powers for defending New York City from crime and scum. On the side, he frequently visits Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), an Oscorp scientist who worked with Parker's dad for numerous years. Connors has ambition to create a regeneration serum to give him his right arm back, but when something goes horribly wrong, he becomes 'The Lizard,' an evil, menacing creature, who serves as the story's main villain.Parker, played by Andrew Garfield, is still his geeky self, but it has been reduced quite a bit from Raimi's effort. The original Spider-Man had Peter Parker tripping on his own shoelaces. Here, Garfield makes the character noticeably an outcast, but doesn't hammer in the idea that the character is rather soft. When it comes down to Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield, while both actors never cease to impress me with their choice of roles or on-screen presence, I was still more sold on Maguire, who had the role down to a tune. Garfield is a very talented actor, and I think he has many things here to rebound off of, such as Emma Stone's memorable charisma and personality, yet I feel he provides almost too much confidence to a character who is supposed to be rather unassuming. The comic book character was easily identifiable if you were an outcast, but Garfield gives his role to much of a hybrid-appearance.As far as confidence goes, the film has quite a lot of it. It is stylishly put together, memorably crafted, and very, very dark. The original film incorporated many primary colors and flashy action sequences to remind us of the panels of a comic book. Director Mark Webb makes this an inevitably more stylistic piece, by adding more darkness to the picture and to the story of Parker himself. He projects the character's struggle and agony in a believable way, and this was something Raimi's installment neglected. Some scenes of battle and peril go on for too long here, but one scene, on a bridge during one of the first main Lizard fight scenes, is incredibly moving and touching.There are times when Webb's direction and the screenplay, written by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent, and Steve Kloves, is pleasantly patient, yet there are times when it's rushed and impatient. Part of the problem is there is so much to handle when making a 'Spider-Man' film. Even Raimi's original had some trouble with pacing. The problem is you're trying to breathlessly juggle an immense amount of truly meaningful characters, subplots, and instances that some of them go a tad underdeveloped. Take for example the love story between Peter and Gwen, a welcomed addition to the story. Although the romance is sweet and good-natured, the love story involving Peter and Mary Jane played much better, mainly because of the sincere and open discussions they had along the way. There is so much going on with this film that the love story seems rather traditional at times. Not to mention, it is noticeable that the story of Dr. Connors was somewhat undermined to incorporate more scenes of action and romance.I stand by my views when it comes to The Amazing Spider-Man's purpose of existence, which is slim and rather unnecessary. The story is all too familiar, and will be for the next few decades seeing as we now have two franchises, one in its early stages, about the same character with relatively the same line of events. Raimi's film was the first feature film about the character, and after twenty-five years in development hell, it was refreshing and welcoming to be shown a hero of such depth and charm. While I say this, I can recognize that the film is aesthetically pleasing, visually enjoyable, and acted with gratitude and satisfaction. I too admire Marc Webb's direction, which in just a matter of three years went from sentimental indie romance to lightning fast blockbuster.Starring: Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Rhys Ifans, Denis Leary, Campbell Scott, Irrfan Khan, Martin Sheen, Sally Field, and Chris Zylka.

54," Nothing but wanna-be party monsters
","Studio 54 was one of the defining clubs of the seventies. Known for its lavish parties, limitless energy, and the known hangout for A-list celebrities, its inviting, yet elusive atmosphere completely challenged the party-life at that point in time. It was a cultural staple that has now faded into a curious piece of history.It's only logical that a film make an attempt to capture the energy and the enigma of the popular nightclub, and Mark Christopher's 54 does just that at a basic level. Enthusiasts of the nightclub will find the atmosphere of the film adoring and majestic, while detractors or outsides will find little to note here. This is more a Cliff Notes representation of an enormous cultural staple. Think the social change the Vietnam War provided being summed up in a pamphlet of information.The film stars Ryan Phillippe as Shane O'Shea, a young Jersey boy who lives a pretty unremarkable life until he ups the courage to cross the New York/Jersey border and becomes a bartender at Studio 54. Not long after, he meets the aspiring singer Anita (Salma Hayek) and her overprotective husband, Greg (Breckin Meyer) and gradually becomes closer and closer with Anita and alienating Greg in the meantime. Shane also finds himself slightly at odds with the egomaniac club-owner Steve Rubell (Mike Myers), who consistently reminds him he is an easily-replaceable pretty face. Overtime, Shane becomes sucked into the twisted drug culture that Studio 54 bears, along with the heavily dramatic lifestyle, which will ultimately cause his demise and the club's.One would anticipate a film like 54 be able to capture the strange, uncouth wackiness of the club along with being able to bring the raw focus had by a film like Boogie Nights and the sophistication of a film like Casino. Unfortunately, we don't get much of either. 54 is a fine examination of a club, but it's too unwilling to go beneath the surface and really expose anything. It plays safe, hitting the right notes at the right time. Never does it become inoffensive or shifts its tone into a rawer, more unadulterated look.Both of the aforementioned films had the luxury of surprising their audiences whether it was in the way of style or in the way of content. 54 remains something of an effigy in terms of style; it features rather muted colors and not a lot of dance floor excitement as the club was known for. We get a more behind the scenes look, which is nice, but rarely do we dive much into the characters to a get a sense of what they're truly about. We know a bit more about the characters than the average caricatures that pass in a raunchy teen flick but not by a whole lot.Returning to the point of the style of the particular film, it's all pretty bland and inert. The excitement and energy that existed in the club isn't translated well enough to film. If 54 wanted to take on a persona equivalent to that of, say, European art-house, what could've unfolded would've been sure beauty in the way of color and vibe. It settles for a mediocre palette of redundant colors - that is when the film chooses to show them off.At least we have a slew of solid performances here; Ryan Phillippe is strong as the lead character, portraying his rise believably and his downfall professionally, Salma Hayek is interesting to watch as always, Breckin Meyer gets a few laughs, and Mike Myers gives the best or his worst performance of his career depending on how you look at it. While no performance is necessarily bad, they all occupy an uncertain state in the sense that nobody knows if they're supposed to be serious or satirical. Myers' character seems to be from a different film, playing Rubell with a looser persona rather than Phillippe, who seems to be playing Shane with complete seriousness.54 is benefited by a strong cast and favorable writing from director Christopher, but it's relatively too safe and too restricted to truly call itself the encompassing film on an entire culture.Starring: Ryan Phillippe, Salma Hayek, Neve Campbell, Breckin Meyer, Mike Myers, and Sela Ward.

Dallas Buyers Club," McConaughey should just live in the working class south from now on
","Dallas Buyers Club tells a classic anti-hero story concerning an ailing, homophobic bull rider who tests HIV positive upon visiting a doctor. He is told he has a mere thirty days to live. As expected, he brushes off the doctors warnings about being deathly sick, saying it's impossible for him to be ill because he is no 'daisy-puller' and is straight as an arrow.However, this stubborn arrogance will be both his drawback and, ultimately, his method for success. He becomes desperate, paranoid, and deeply self-conscious, making the decision to travel to Mexico to obtain a series off unapproved Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drugs that he read about online. It's the 1980's, the HIV/AIDS scare is hugely prominent in pop culture, and FDA approved drugs seem to be doing more harm than good. Our anti-hero plans to show the public they're being poisoned, cheated, and lied to by an agency driven by profits and not the greater good of the American people.Our anti-hero is Ron Woodroof, played, once again, by a stellar Matthew McConaughey, who has finally earned enough money where he can partake in films with ambition and a fabulous storyline (kind of like the opposite of Robert De Niro). This is only McConaughey's umpteenth venture into bonafide, working class, trailer park culture, with such winners as Bernie Killer Joe, and Mud already firmly secured under his belt. Once more, he gives a beautiful performance as an unlikable character doing unlikeable things, however, making us still appreciate and root for him in the end. He is assisted by the likes of a transgender female (Jared Leto, in perhaps the riskiest role of his career) and viewed uncertainly by his physician (Jennifer Garner), who is conflicted whether or not to allow him the luxury of running a buyers club, providing people with unapproved but helpful drugs, or to keep patients coming back to her hospital to provide them with sub-par care and assistance.The writing team of Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack rarely take a wrong step in portraying Woodroof as a contemptible, but admirable man hungry for life, not survival. In order to do this well, they downplay all emotional significance in the film to vague hints the audience can take either way. Some scenes, we could definitely believe Woodroof is beginning to have feelings for his transgender partner. At other times, we can maybe sense a potential relationship between him and his physician. But Borten and Wallack have bigger fish to fry in a story with much more to it than a schmaltzy love story.Politically, the film can be analyzed both ways. We can see that the aforementioned writing team and the directing talents of Jean-Marc Vallée may be trying to promote alternative medicine in America - a case which definitely needs to be made, and only makes more sense as we see its significance in the 1980's. In a country driven more by pharmaceutical sales than ever before, the case should be made for several kinds of alternative medicine, and having Woodroof's story portrayed on film is liable to spark conversation and even a debate about the benefits and the need for other options.A scene in Dallas Buyers Club explains why this was tricky then and is even more tricky now, with corporate profits being at the forefront of concerns most of the time. Woodroof storms in on an HIV support group meeting, hooked up to an IV on wheels, when an agent of the FDA is speaking at the seminar. He states how these big, government-controlled corporations keep the real, beneficial drugs closeted and the research that proves their reliability hidden and instead approve drugs that act either as placebos or as weak solutions to a macro-problem. As expected, Woodroof is thrown out after less than a minute of sensible ranting, and this marks one of the many scenes in the film that will spark outrage and disgust amongst audience members.Dallas Buyers Club, thankfully, has numerous people behind it that takes its material seriously and see the wealth of social commentary the screenplay provides. Between a fearless and completely believable McConaughey as the lead, to Jared Leto's sensitive and heartbreaking performance as a man already ostracized in society with additional huge problems, the talents writing team, the equally intelligent director, and the softly-colored visual palette of colors, the film succeeds on nearly every level in terms of a biographical piece, an interesting drama, and, once more, the story of an anti-hero we simultaneously love and hate. The film's trailer included an amazing song by the band The Heavy titled 'What Makes a Good Man?' and I simply can't think of a better song to summarize this movie's subject matter and greatness in terms of intimate focus on a character with a poor personality but a strong mentality.Starring: Matthew McConaughey, Jared Leto, and Jennifer Garner.

The Fast and the Furious," A fine example of cinematic adrenaline and incredulity
","The Fast and the Furious is, at the very least, an intriguing franchise, for it gives gearheads the kind of inspiration and fantasy they need to have to keep sane. I've always found car hobbyists to face quite the paradox; the problem with cars is that they are grossly expensive, so if you're a middle class man, having two is quite the luxury. However, if you're deep into cars as a fascination, you presumably not only want one or two cars, you want several, and you want them customized and rigged to your liking. Customizing and optimizing the performance on one car is grossly expensive, but having a garage of half a dozen or more customized/optimized vehicles could cost as much as your house and your neighbor's houses put together. This is why, each and every day, I'm more and more satisfied with my lack of interest in cars and my own obsession with the Honda Accord I drive.The Fast and the Furious also gives gearheads that kind of adrenaline rush and visualization of their dreams realized because they, themselves, often don't have the means, the vehicles, nor the kind of closed-range courses to carry out the kind of eye-popping stunts and mayhem the characters in these films cause. It caters to that level of unbridled excitement, when you're actually racing in a vehicle and that moment where you get that indescribable pang in your chest reminding you know that you're alive. I was fully ready to embrace this franchise for its fantastical elements, but unsure if I could still be entertained watching car chases and death-defying stunts for an upwards of two hours.What's pleasant about The Fast and the Furious is that it focuses on the relationships the characters have with one another in the midst of all the racing. The film's slender plot revolves around Brian O'Connors (Paul Walker), an undercover Los Angeles police officer sent to infiltrate a ring of truck hijackers and street racers in the heart of L.A.. Led by Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), a suave know-it-all when it comes to vehicles, the gang is known for their heavily armed carjacking activities of large eighteen wheelers, in addition to their work at auto-body shops where they modify and customize cars, some of which flirting with and others unabashedly breaking the laws of what is street legal. Also working in Dom's crew are Leticia Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez), his longtime girlfriend and mechanic at his shop, in addition to his sister Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster), whom becomes the apple of Brian's eye late in the film.Brian's infiltration of Dom's ring soon becomes corrupted by his fascination with the culture Dom and his crew have created; it's a culture that specializes in prompting and maintaining a longterm adrenaline rush in the most unique and heart-pounding ways. Despite Brian's responsibility to uphold the law through all this, he finds his involvement with Dom going above and beyond the call of the law, as far as hooking up with Dom's sister and helping Dom plot a crackdown of former partners that have turned into rival gangmembers following a reneged agreement.No matter which way you slice it, The Fast and the Furious is slight in substance, but often very strong on a level of entertainment. At only one-hundred minutes, it pleasantly skates by without being too much of an assault on the senses and operates largely on the charm and infectious personalities of its actors. Walker is the standout of the crowd, maintaining a certain level of cool and street-smarts and his character never hitting the level of cocksure confidence, making him a more watchable and likable presence. That's not to undermine Diesel's role here, because without him, this film wouldn't be as much of a bromance as it already is. From the first race, it is clear that Walker and Diesel have enough chemistry to create a bond between two opposite characters in terms of life paths in order to go on many more adventures with one another. The supporting cast of Rodriguez and Brewster are fine, though even in more masculine roles, the two feel like nothing more than decorative pieces of eye-candy that help further the plot along when convenient.But perhaps such was just destined to be the case in The Fast and the Furious, a film where escapist tendencies take over and nothing else matters besides the moment when your car begins to redline or a part becomes misplaced in Dom's garage of odds and ends. Being that this film largely predicates itself on male bonding and the thrill of racing from both an illegal and adrenaline-charged angle, The Fast and the Furious largely possesses a homey quality that makes it believable and grounded in reality, despite a certain conclusion with a certain train that, I confess, was still entertaining in the realm of cinematic incredulity. This is a fun and effective film in being every gearhead's fantasy and being a damn fine piece of entertainment.Starring: Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, and Jordana Brewster.

Goon," Was he born in Big Beaver by the borderline?
","Goon bares a striking resemblance to Kevin Smith's upcoming hockey drama, Hit Somebody!, named after the famous Warren Zevon song. That film, too, is about a hockey player who can't do much more than fight, but is determined to keep his team protected. The only difference is that the song seemed to be more about a man's personal dream of being a successful hockey player despite his poor performances in games, while Goon pretty much stops at 'a man who is good at fighting on ice.' But that doesn't mean it's not an efficient comedy. Rather than creating a desperately unlikable character and tacking on a contrived romance, like in Happy Gilmore, Goon constructs a likable, if not simple-minded character who we come to not only sympathize with, but yet, kind of love. The character is Doug Glatt, played very well by Seann William Scott. Glatt isn't as smart as his father and brother, whom are both doctors, and feels extremely isolated because of it. His best friend, played by the unnecessarily vulgar and crude Jay Baruchel, takes him to a hockey game one day where, after a fight with a player, Doug finds out he has a knack for fighting.This brings him to the attention of a coach who recruits Doug as team enforcer, where he is expected to protect the players and the team at all times. At first, Doug can't skate or even control a puck, but he proves to be more than a fighting caricature later on in his career.The film is inevitably sweet and pretty heartfelt, despite its simple nature. There is a love story, which the film could do without, but the film refuses to become gooey or heavy-handed and simply looks at it as a secondary plot-point rather than an obligation in storytelling. The direction by Michael Dowse, of Take Me Home Tonight fame, is well done and there's a very nice coherency during the fight scenes.As far as the fight scenes go, I was expecting them to be rushed, cartoony, and a bit too comical, but they're not. They're actually gritty, realistic, and a little dark. They show a bit of wear after fight number four or five, but the direction, setup, and pacing that comes before these fights does the best it can to avoid redundancy. It actually works quite favorably.Written by Baruchel and Superbad's Evan Goldberg, Goon is a comedy about a likable character who does unlikable things because he is good at them. There's nothing totally wrong with that. It's not like in Super, where a man runs around in tights bashing peoples' heads in with a wrench because they cut in line at a movie theater. Doug Glatt isn't a monster - he's a character. One who becomes developed more than the simple plot would lead us to believe. This is a fun comedy. Not urgent, exciting, or a laugh riot, but a fun, character-driven comedy with heart. We need more of those today.Starring: Seann William Scott, Jay Baruchel, and Eugene Levy.

Now You See Me," Magic in one era, blasphemy in another
","Magic in cinema has lost a lot of its, well, magical qualities due to the fact that special effects and visual wizardry can be pulled off by even someone so much as a common man. Considering film was founded on the principles of perception, illusion, and amateur craft, it's a wonder why it's so rare we get a modern picture exploring mentalism in a greater sense. Finally, there's Louis Leterrier's Now You See Me, a film centered around magicians and magic that examines the world in such a style that it should be taken in carefully and with a potent sense of admiration. It's easily one of the more surprising pictures of the year, combining effective mystery with plot-twists to make for a ravishing experience.The plot: four crafty magicians, Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher), Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) and Merritt Osbourne (Woody Harrelson), are united by an odd-force and a year later are seen as the 'Four Horsemen' by a sold-out Vegas crowd. For their final act, they decide to summon an assuming audience member to state the name of his bank so that he can be teleported through time to rob it accordingly. The bank is in France and in mere seconds is the man transported, given instructions about what to do when there, and finally, the money begins to rain from the ceiling of the arena. Of course this summons national attention and FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) is soon on the case trying to infiltrate the Horseman and discover what the underlying secret is to their tricks.Leterrier's directorial game has always been in the field of slick action productions, such as the first two 'Transporter' films and the recent remake of Clash of the Titans, which he later apologized for. His talent for directing a picture that relies heavily on visual trickery and giving the audience the idea they are 'getting it' when they aren't even close is meticulous and surprisingly precise. An interesting footnote is 'Now You See Me' was shot with an anamorphic lens on film in order to make the effects appear not too hokey but not too realistic as if they were showing them done with certainty and complete accuracy.The trio of writers — Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin (Remember the Titans), and Edward Ricourt — however, encounter one issue and that is the issue of greater emphasis on plot and twists as opposed to character and development. The film features such an ensemble cast that does wonders making the material accessible, interesting, and immersing in the first two acts that, by the third, the events and twists have almost overwhelmed the picture to the point of the actors having to run to catch up with the pace of the film. This isn't a huge issue, but it isn't until the final twist is explained – that does feel a little rushed and sketchy – that you begin to realize you really know nothing about these magicians besides they each house enough cockiness to make up for two stubborn hockey teams that are entering Game 7 in the playoffs.Nonetheless, Now You See Me is a good film, but due to the cinematic mastery of special effects the power of magic and perception inevitably feels tainted. I'm reminded of how cinematic shorts got by in the late 1880′s when all auteurs had were cameras and the power of illusion; not slickness, shock, and trickery all created by a hefty budget. How would pioneer filmmaker Georges Méliès view Now You See Me? He'd probably dismiss it as blasphemy before getting back to work.My video review of Now You See Me, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Rceapdsz4",8,2,6,3 June 2013
Gandhi," While attentive to key aspects in humanizing a character, it still makes the same mistake many biopics and epics do
","Richard Attenborough's Gandhi is the perfect film to show someone if they want to see the true art of character actor and witness an actor lose himself in a role for over three hours. Ben Kingsley commands the screen as Mahatma Gandhi, almost never leaving the frame, and with that, creates an immersing film on the basis of a figure alone, who transitions epic and larger-than-life boundaries to become a man on a human level. The opening title card of the film states that it's impossible for a single film to show and develop all of one man's accomplishments on screen, as well as giving each time period and year their allotted weight and detail. However, this particular film's prime goal is to be spiritually accurate and faithful to the life of Gandhi by showing his active pluralism, reading and following Hindu, Christian, Muslim, and Jewish principles and being a loyal man of God through various different religions.On that level, Gandhi succeeds overwhelmingly; at over three hours, the spiritual effects of the film are never desecrated, nor limited in their size or impact. Writer John Briley and Attenborough provide keen attention to detail in various spiritual aspects of the film, not only showing Gandhi as a loyal follower, but delicately handling each religion with its own respect and grace. On a human level, Gandhi succeeds for the most part because having the man in the frame for most of the film, through his journey of courageous, non-violent resistance and self-doubt, provide for a focus that is deeply rooted in realism and human emotions. Gandhi, however, doesn't overcome the hump of basically doing exactly what its title card said was impossible from the get-go; the film, at one-hundred and eighty-seven minutes long, tries to pack in far too much and, in turn, becomes a grating sit well into its two hours. We see important historical events that are either not fully developed or shortchanged so that the film can be inclusive to nearly every major event in Gandhi's life, and it is with the film's persistency to check off a laundry list of events that it obscures opportunities to further humanize its central figure.The film follows Kingsley's Gandhi as a man who was motivated following being thrown from a train in South Africa for being in the traditionally all-white first class section to liberate the Indian people of the region. Gandhi preaches the gospel of non-violent resistance, which doesn't condone acts of brutality against oppressors, however, doesn't accept passivity either. Gandhi believes in resistance that shows that he and his brothers and sisters are fed up with harsh treatment, and rises above such acts of brutality by showing who really is the strongest.Following Indian liberation in South Africa, Gandhi takes on a task that initially seems insurmountable; liberate the Indians of the oppressive British Empire, a challenge he accepts following his return home to India where he is recognized as a hero and a powerful figure. It is here when Gandhi decides to partake in a hunger strike, an action which is, essentially, being violent to oneself rather than a specific group of people. It is during is fight for India's independence that we, and Gandhi, for that matter, see just what he's made of and all he is capable of as a human being.An event of Gandhi's life that would've been fit for a film itself would've been the hunger strike, which crippled Gandhi and made him a skinnier soul than he already was. Such an event, like Nelson Mandela's prison sentence of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Selma protest, are events that would've made for fine, epic films benefiting from a concentration in a specific event. Gandhi's is a film that occupies a grand amount of space and a large amount of time, even boasting an intermission, and with all this time and ground to cover, inevitably, even if you don't know the entire story, you know that certain situations were truncated or lack the kind of development needed to make them more meaningful. While Attenborough slows the film down to assert Gandhi's religious devotion and his human qualities, he nonetheless makes the classic mistake of epics and biopics in that he tries to cover too much ground that even the liberal runtime of three hours and eleven minutes cannot do effectively.Starring: Ben Kinglsey, Rohini Hattangadi, and Roshan Seth.

Pearl Harbor," Seems more like a disservice to those involved
","Michael Bay's approach to Pearl Harbor, centering around a tedious, contrived love-triangle is like watching a film about a first date on September 11, 2001. While one thing is going on that seems so trivial, so senseless, and so impulsive, a major historical event is taking place and instead of focusing on the bigger issue, we're stuck on a smaller, more secluded issue that is almost entirely irrelevant.The last time I witnessed such a big-budget miscalculation had to be when I watched Michael Bay's other atrocity Armageddon, which also victimized Ben Affleck into a senseless funk of action filmmaking. That was just an action film that exemplified the worst qualities of action cinema. Pearl Harbor, on the other hand, exercises the worst qualities of a war film, focusing on a lackluster love story and a brutal war without any agenda that I could find. Just one to milk sentiment from the audience and for a war film to rely on that move is almost cowardice. Do I need to cue Aerosmith's 'I Don't Want to Miss a Thing?' The film follows Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett), two First Lieutenants for America during World War II. Thrill-seeking buddies, they both become involved in a relationship with Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale), an army nurse. Rafe becomes romantically involved first, exchanging disgustingly cheesy dialog like 'something hurts,' after a fall injures his nose. 'It's probably your nose,' Evelyn replies. Rafe hits her with, 'I think it's my heart.' Groan-worthy dialog really doesn't stop there. When Rafe enrolls in the Eagle Squadron, he is shipped off to the dogfighting portion of combat, with rumors of his plane being shot down and being killed in the process. After this news circulates, while both heartbroken, Danny and Evelyn begin to have a relationship on their own, only to discover that Rafe is indeed alive and well and now angry his best friend has stolen his girl in the process.This is all troublesome indeed, but in the meantime, there is a giant, merciless war that shows no sign of ending going on right behind you guys, and this petty drama as the main focus of Michael Bay's epic seems a bit senseless, don't you think? I'm all for the humanization of war figures and characters involved in battles, but when there's a film about an enormous militaristic crisis and tragedy and its choice to focus on a love triangle instead of the real struggle at hand seems disingenuous. To use another analogy, it's like interviewing a couple who had a marital argument on a train that derailed about that argument. There's a larger, more interesting, more compelling, more emotionally touching story at hand and this is what you focus on? When we do see the battle at hand, and the action scenes, the production values are very high and the action is watchable. This is for about ten to fifteen minutes before the Michael Bay formula of making every explosion out to be an ear-shattering time bomb and every perilous instance to be a meteoric cacophony of sound that it becomes a muchness. Bay is a guy who loves to make his visuals loud and glossy and to that I give him credit. He should direct music videos for a living. His films, however, always assume this status and become nothing more than a showcase for visuals and a house for stale drama and characters that are developed in a way that feels like an obligation. Granted Bay has never written a film, a fact often misinterpreted, but I'm still trying to discover if screenplays handed to him are chocked full of character development and interesting human drama and, upon being handed back to the writer, are littered with footnotes about when to include an explosion or an action sequence in bold, red ink.It's odd to note that with a romance involved, a war at hand, and a serious dilemma between characters all occurring in one film, the three hours Pearl Harbor utilizes are dull and boring ones. Affleck and Hartnett are both capable actors, but are given dialog that just bleeds clichés, and accompanied by a script penned by Randall Wallace (the man responsible for writing Braveheart), I can't help but feel that the film's corny depiction of a 1940's romance and the scenes depicting the bombing of Pearl Harbor are a disservice and perhaps offensive to veterans of the war. The film feels like a Hollywood action movie, one that is intended as something to profit off of a tragedy and make entertainment out of it, rather than show the event as it really was. There are literally hundreds of ideas to base a film about Pearl Harbor off of and it's surprising to note that with the abundance of Holocaust films that are all very accomplished and smartly done, we have one widely known film about Pearl Harbor and it's a macro-disappointment.Starring: Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, and Kate Beckinsale.

No Strings Attached," A few strings are still tied to deliver the expected
","Natalie Portman and Nicholas Cage are two actors that have won an Oscar and continue to do films, some in below average quality, and some just completely awful compared to the one they won for. Portman has done No Strings Attached and Your Highness aside from her amazing drama Black Swan. Cage has done pretty much anything else since Leaving Las Vegas, most of it being bland and goofy films that showcase his oddball sense of direction and hairstyles.No Strings Attached is a romantic comedy, that at first seems like a different film making the characters shy away from romance and love, when ultimately we know what will happen. It doesn't take a genius to find out that Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman wind up together at the end of the film. Did you expect anything different? Movies like this are nice to watch, and most of the time keep a positive feel. But they are ruined by the inevitable outcome all of these movies have. The plot revolves around a medical student named Emma (Portman) and a TV executive named Adam (Kutcher). Both were the teenagers that knew each other, but never spoke in school and now they are starting to hang out more and talk with each other.Emma is a workaholic and Adam just says 'yes' to everything. When Emma says their relationship will be a sort of FWB style bond, Adam agrees and they have random sex on on/off occasions. Then they start feeling things for each other, we get a bunch of lovey-dovey between the two, and so on.There are little perks to this movie. Jennifer Irwin has a minor role as one of the Television directors. I appreciated Irwin's work as Aunt Linda on the sitcom Still Standing, and she still doesn't seem like she changed her personality in this. Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman play a likable and cute couple side by side. Kutcher cleans up his act a little, and Portman has some fun with her character being a little foul-mouthed and outspoken. And we do get some cute dialog between them as well.The R rating isn't as R as I would've thought. It's a questionable, high-maintenance PG-13 movie with a few dirty words. The sex scenes are extremely clean and are only suggestive. No Strings Attached is bumped up by a few smiles brought on by the cast and the dialog, but the plot and overall execution is just another, we-know-it-before-we-see-it sort of turnout. I expected a bit more daring acts from Kutcher and Portman together. Kutcher is a good actor in good movies, and Portman is on the rise to be an A list star. They only give their very early performance like skills in this film when they are so much more.Starring: Ashton Kutcher, Natalie Portman, Greta Gerwig, Jake M. Johnson, Cary Elwes, and Jennifer Irwin. Directed by: Ivan Reitman.",7,1,3,6 June 2011
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," A Retro Battle of Epic-ness
","Michael Cera films are close to home for me. Cera always plays a nerdish sort of loner character that I can relate to. Superbad and this are both films by him that I can put my shoes in his position. Scott Pilgrim is a graphic novel series that I never heard of until a few months ago after seeing a trailer for this film. Apparently, Scott Pilgrim is the character in his self titled graphic novel series in which five books were made with the first one being made about five years ago. Im unaware if this one focuses on just the second book (since both the second book and the movie share the same title) or if the movie is just an all around overview of the series. Whatever it is, its an excellent, 80s style, comic book movie combined with likable characters and a mindblowing soundtrack.The standout of this movie is the soundtrack. The music by Scott Pilgrim's fictional band, 'Sex-Bab-Omb' stands out totally. The music is so intense it shakes the screen whenever played. The music literally causes drawn lightning bolts and jittering of the camera when played which is awesome and gives you the feeling you're in the environment. Its a unique, almost indescribable feeling. Its so fast moving and energetic by the time you realized what happened a new scene appears. Its a feeling that can be had, unless you watch the film yourself.Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is a twenty two year old slacker whos life activities are playing video games and in a band. Hes dating a seventeen year old High Schooler named Knives Chau (Ellen Wong) in which he's gotten a lot of hate for by his sister and fellow band members. He frequently sees a girl in his dreams whom he saw at a record store not too long ago. He meets the girl who is Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Ramona is a quiet, shy woman, who is known for her frequent disappearances and mysterious personality. Her and Scott go steady for a while then after a random fight at a concert, Scott is told by Ramona that he needs to defeat her 'seven evil exes' to continue dating her.The film plays out like an arcade style game from the 1980s and various references to the video game 'Pac-Man' confirm that as well. Every time one of the evil exes is defeated various coins explode out like a video game causing Scott to collect them which is strangely amusing. Director of this adventure, Edgar Wright has proved to be more than just capable of British Comedies doing Shaun of the Dead in 2004 and doing Hot Fuzz two years later. He is now shown to have a talent in graphic novel adaptations of other series he didn't start as well.From the 16 bit like Universal intro I knew this was going to be a great film. It has some strange moments and sometimes the text on screen becomes annoying and somewhat tedious, but its definitely a teenage movie. Its a movie that should be enjoyed by people between the age of thirteen and thirty and by male audiences. Anybody with a knowledge of classic 80s and 90s video games will like this and the movie does a good job introducing the characters and their personalities to newcomers to the series (as am I). I will hunt for the graphic novels as I am interested in other events held by Scott Pilgrim.One more thing that bothers me though is the film made a mere $10 million in its first week. It may seem fair, but with an estimated $80 million budget its abysmal. More people should see this because it's probably the most original movie in a while. It almost jumps off the screen without the use of the RealD technology which more movies should use. Movies shouldn't use 3D to jump off the screen. If they want to find a way to bring the audience suspense and feel like the third dimension without making them where glasswear, watch Scott Pilgrim and it'll show the way and the possibility of the action.Starring: Michael Cera, Ellen Wong, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead.

Inside Out," A culmination of an animation studio's two decades of sheer brilliance
","Pixar's 'Inside Out' may be the most heartfelt and morally honest film the renowned animated studio has made in their now two decades of operation. This film is an all-encompassing testament to the animated studio's ability to please audiences of all ages, innovate new designs and atmospheres to their already immaculately detailed environments, explore uncharted realms in the field, and give people a film that seriously makes them look at themselves introspectively. This is more than a film people, kids and parents, will want to see, but a film they will need to see.This is a film that's far easier to watch than it is to explain. We are greeted with Riley Anderson (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias), a spunky eleven-year-old who loves hockey but is undergoing a move from Minnesota to San Francisco that will drastically change her life. She'll have to make new friends, adjust to a new environment, and really attempt to fit in, as she's entering a very tumultuous time in life.This will obviously cause an emotional roller-coaster for her, which is why we spend most of our time inside Riley's mind, where we meet her emotions. Joy (Amy Poehler) is her most prominent emotion, commanding the headquarters of Riley's mind so that she is the happy, cheerful little girl we always see. Riley's supporting emotions are Sadness (Phyllis), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), and Disgust (Mindy Kaling), all of whom chiming in at one point or another, but with Joy frequently commanding the ride. However, when Sadness causes a serious accident, resulting in the loss of Riley's core memories, Sadness and Joy, along with the core memories, are subsequently sucked into the subconscious mind of Riley. Here, Riley cannot access her memories of Sadness and Joy, nor her core memories, leaving her with the inability to express any emotion besides fear, anger, and disgust.As a result, Sadness and Joy must work their way back to the headquarters of Riley's mind, a task that need be completed soon or every defining asset of Riley cherishes, be it hockey, her family, or her goofy side, will crumble, leaving her an empty shell of a human with the inability to feel.As a reminder, 'Inside Out' is not nearly this confusing to follow. In fact, it's rather amazing how writer/director Pete Docter ('Monster's Inc,' 'Up') and the remaining screen writing team of Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley make this film so easily accessible to kids. Kids will instantly recognize the playfulness of the emotions controlling Riley's mind, and, presumably as a result, consider how their own emotions impact them on a daily basis. The incredible cast of voice actors shouldn't go unnoticed, as they're essentially playing the bare basics of characters by predicating themselves on one core emotion. However, surprisingly so, one of the most memorable and heartfelt characters isn't an emotion, but Bing Bong (Richard Kind), Riley's imaginary friend who guides Sadness and Joy through the different depths of Riley's mind. Kind voices Bing Bong with a potent sense of happiness and sadness, making him one of the most sympathetic animated characters in recent memories. As Poehler describes him in a Q&A, his character is like a vaudeville actor pining to prove himself during one last performance.It's redundant to continue to praise Pixar's exquisitely detailed visual effects, so let's focus on the meatier aspects of 'Inside Out,' like its emotional relevance with its audience. This is the very definition of a crowdpleasing film. We can all recall a time when our emotions got the best of us and we said things we didn't mean, or recall when our emotions were so indescribable we could barely think straight. It also houses the valuable lesson that, in order for a mind to fully operate, every emotion must play a part (a rude but necessary awakening for Joy). 'Inside Out' makes you imagine this sort of scenario going on in your own head by not only focusing on Riley's mind but flawlessly segwaying the story to show how the minds of others work (the scene during the end credits is comedic gold in terms of carrying this idea to the fullest). Furthermore, so many elements had to be considered for this kind of film, such as portraying the emotions of the five main emotions, as well as making their personalities likable despite the emotions they're representing. Docter, LeFauve, and Cooley handle this in an incredibly dignified manner.The only thing burdening 'Inside Out,' ultimately, is its lack of emotional subtlety. When you're making a motion picture revolving so blatantly around emotions (or, as the tagline cleverly puts it, a 'major emotion picture'), you're going to have a film that leaves few emotions unexploited. With 'Inside Out,' while it doesn't crank up the mawkishness to cloying levels, it does inevitably leave the film dictating your own emotions while you watch the film. Yet, this isn't as big of a problem as it should be, mainly because rather than amplifying pathos, the trio of writers are more compelled with trying to craft an innovative and unique movie-going/moviewatching experience for the audience, which is evident with nearly every frame in the film.'Inside Out' is a culmination of a craft Pixar has held for two decades, which have been filled with ostensibly everything active imaginations and incorruptible creativity can conjure up. The fact that they'll likely continue down this path, despite ostensibly making one idea that's better than the next, is something that will almost always leave me excited.",9,5,32,16 June 2015
Remember the Titans," 'You play to win the game. You don't play to just play'
","Remember the Titans is a racial parable with a sports premise in the foreground. This is one of the selected films that does a great job at two different things. It doesn't get too preoccupied with either, and winds up making the two flow nicely without being heavy-handed or incoherent. It has great lead actors for the coaches, great character actors for the players, and a nicely concocted, if simple, moral that ties the ribbon on the package.Despite a few noticeable flaws, the high rating is because the film excels at things other sports films don't even bother touching. We'll get into that later. The film is based on the true story of Herman Boone (Washington), an African American man who becomes the head coach of a high school football team in Alexandria, Virgina, docking long time white coach Bill Yoast (Patton) to defensive coordinator.It's 1971. The Civil Rights movement has recently taken place, and the blacks now have equal rights, but unequal opportunities. It's that awkward period where they have rights, but still seem like they are fighting to prove they do. The blacks, who try out for the football team, are proud to see one of their own coaching a high school. The whites are furious, yet accept that they will be playing in an integrated team, with a black head coach.The town has mixed reception towards the idea. The whites are very sour and skeptical, and the blacks are overjoyed, respectively. The team soon proves themselves worthy of recognition by winning game after game, when they are put through Coach Boone's long, painful, unforgivable drills at a two week camp.There are a wide variety of students on the team, as one would expect. They are religious Jerry nicknamed 'The Rev' because he is always praying (Kirkwood), tough guy Gerry (Hurst), bad boy Julius (Harris), stocky and simple Louie (Suplee), and many others. Even a young Ryan Gosling shows up in many scenes.My favorite character, by far, was Louie. Ethan Suplee has a natural screen talent for the sweet and simple type, but plays the role not as a caricature, but in a very humanistic way. That's the key word here; humanistic. One of the many things Remember the Titans gets right is that it develops its characters, and doesn't believe it will happen automatically without any amount of effort. Screenwriter Gregory Allen Howard gives almost all the football players their own story to tell. Regardless of what they are, he tries, and succeeds impressively.The role of Herman Boone could only be played by Denzel Washington. When you hire Washington to star in your film, you take one look at his serious face and know what you're getting. A fearless leader, that can carry a movie on his shoulders regardless of length or content, and never stumbles or trips up on anything. It is clear he learned something from working on Spike Lee's Malcolm X. In that film, he was a determined Civil Rights leader, looking to do anything for equal rights. Here, he plays a determined football coach, looking to do anything for equal opportunities on and off the field.Like I said, there are some minor things that stuck out to me, more for the worse than the better. For one, the film feels a bit neutered. Sure, this is a bit pushy for a Disney film, nonetheless a PG rated Disney film, but everything feels a bit too simple. A bit too genial. Surely more abuse was caused by the townspeople rather than most happening on the field. There is never really a major conflict that isn't resolved within minutes. Also, the ending is a bit hazy. It doesn't really cement change in a very strong way. It almost makes it seem like the problem of racism and inequality depended on the outcome of a football game.It is common for films involving a teacher, a coach, or a counselor, to take one or more characters 'under their wing' to teach them greater things or to think outside the box. Yes, Boone inspires virtually the whole team, but we never see him interact with any of the team members, sincerely, one on one. He tells Louis in one scene that they'll go over his test scores, and I desperately wanted to see what those scenes could possibly unfold into, but they never came through. The man on man sentimentality lacks, but there is still plenty of motivational speeches to sweeten the pot.Remember the Titans accomplishes a great deal, even if it isn't perfect. The levels it succeeds in, storytelling, characterization, and motivation, are some of the hardest to achieve greatness in, and the film appears to do if effortlessly. Washington steals every scene he is in, the football scenes are crisp and effective, and the feeling we're left with is a keen sense of optimism. For a Disney film to do all that is quite an accomplishment.Starring: Denzel Washington, Will Patton, Wood Harris, Ryan Hurst, Kip Pardue, Ryan Gosling, Ethan Suplee, Kate Bosworth, and Hayden Panettiere.

Wreck-It Ralph," 'My name is Ralph and I'm a bad guy'
","Perhaps the most unrealistic detail about Disney's Wreck-It Ralph is that it shows arcades as places that are buzzing with activity from tykes with quarters ready to be used as turns in a video game. Arcades are not a dying breed, but a dead breed, and the only ones that exist now exist in a niche marketing for only the collector and the nostalgic types.However, I'm more than pleased with Disney's decision to introduce a younger generation to the wonders of video games mounted inside a large case, that accept quarters and in return deliver memorable action and invaluable fun. Wreck-It Ralph is among one of the brightest, most fun animated pictures I've ever seen, with look and intelligence seemingly coming from the five-letter animation studio that should remain unnamed (their main director has an 'executive producer' credit here). Gift-wrapped in warm nostalgic vibes and beautiful whimsy, this is a picture that the kids can enjoy and the parents can enjoy, perhaps even more than their little ones. I, for one, can say I enjoyed this more than many of the rambunctious five-year-olds in my theater.The film opens with our main character Ralph (voiced fittingly by John C. Reilly) narrating his life-story, as he spends his days inside an arcade game called Fix-It Felix, Jr. as the game's main villain. His full name, 'Wreck-It Ralph,' defines his job; he is responsible for demolishing a highrise building so that 'Fix-It Felix, Jr.' (controlled by a person in the arcade) can rebuild it quickly using his magic hammer. If the player completes the challenge, amidst while Ralph is throwing things at Felix in the process, they will then see the people who live in the highrise toss Ralph off the roof in glee. Rinse and repeat.This has been Ralph's daily routine since his first day in Litwak's Arcade. He states that he has seen many arcade machines come and go, but his old-fashioned game has gone on to be timeless along with other gems like Pac-Man. We realize that Ralph is stating his remorse and complaints to a group of other video games villains who are bad guys but 'not bad guys.' Get it? To see Dr. Eggman from Sonic the Hedgehog, Clyde, the orange ghost from Pac-Man, and other villains from beloved games gather in one room, reiterating their problems like a band of depressed AA members is touching and one of the many wonderful things about one of Disney's best films.When Ralph is not invited to the thirtieth anniversary of Fix-It Felix, Jr., he decides that is the last straw, and announces to his fellow game-members that he will abandon his duty as villain for the game to pursue other games where he will be more appreciated and, hopefully, earn a medal to show his skills and capabilities. He winds up winning a medal in a first-person shooter game called Hero's Duty, yet becomes lost in a kiddy racing game called Sugar Rush and loses his medal to a little girl named Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman).Vanellope is a glitched character, meaning she often has electronic ticks that render her as incomplete (glitches in real games usually result from a programming error). Her dream is to race with the other girls in Sugar Rush, only she is ostracized to being nothing more than a meaningless glitch. It dawns on Ralph that the only way he'll be able to get a medal is to help Vanellope win the next race and prepares her by getting her a go-kart, teaching her how to drive, and just being her faithful companion.Meanwhile, Fix-It Felix, Jr. (Jack McBrayer) worries about the fate of his arcade game, which occupies the dreaded 'Out of Order' sign on the screen since Ralph's departure, and teams up with Sergeant Tamora Jean Calhoun (Jane Lynch), the lead character in Hero's Duty, to find Ralph and save their arcade game.What's wonderful is seeing this film come equipped with its limitless, never-ending supply of energy that many children's films tend to lack. With many different characters, personalities, and arcade worlds to explore, writers Jennifer Lee and Phil Johnston never run out of material, and the dozens of animators behind this picture never seem to run out of ideas on how to bring these worlds to life. I also adore the way the Toy Story model is erected here, where things normally controlled by humans, take on a life of their own, with real problems, complications, and mischief when they are left to fend for themselves. Seeing these characters interact with each other, behind the monitors and machines in 'Game Central Station' is nothing shy of ingenious and marvelously entertaining.This is a film where colors, craft, characters, vision, creativity, worlds, look, voice-acting, etc shine over cartoon idiocy and redundant childishness. Wreck-It Ralph is one of Disney's strongest works in the company's history and quite possibly the closest any animation studio has come to approaching or one-upping that same five-letter studio I referred to earlier. It takes a simple, effective moral and places it as the backdrop to a story that is emotionally involved, superbly in touch, visually stunning, and fearlessly alive.NOTE: As expected, the film begins with a seven minute short, titled Paperman, about a man who is immediately taken with a woman he meets for seconds while awaiting the arrival of the morning train, and how he spends his workday trying to get her attention. Without giving anything away, just like the film that succeeds it, it is one of the best, most enjoyable shorts in years. Four stars.Voiced by: John C. Reilly, Sarah Silverman, Jack McBrayer, and Jane Lynch. Directed by: Rich Moore.",10,8,10,4 November 2012
Blue Crush," Slightly more intriguing basic entertainment
","John Stockwell's Blue Crush treads so close to the line of falling into the category of impossibly unrealistic romance fare but rebounds significantly by having its main character never lose sight of what's important to her. Just as you think the romantic element of the film will hijack the idea of the conflicts of self-motivation and self-doubt the narrator is having with herself, writers Stockwell and Lizzie Weiss rebound and help the romantic interest of the film's lead character motivate her rather than distract her. In addition, the film also respectfully portrays the surfing culture as more than a gaggle of stoned losers that ride waves and do nothing but slum when the tide comes in.The film stars Kate Bosworth, an actress who, I assume, in 2002 was looking to be the next Kirsten Dunst or Reese Witherspoon until the glory faded, as Anne Marie (Kate Bosworth), a teenager working as a maid at a tourist hotel in Hawaii and surfing with her best friends Eden (Michelle Rodriguez) and Lena (Sanoe Lake) on the side. Anne Marie is also taking care of her fourteen-year-old sister Penny (Mika Boorem) after their mother left for Las Vegas with another guy she met, in addition to training for her surfing comeback in a huge, publicized competition in North Shore. Winners, or highly-skilled participants, of the race are known to get surfing magazine deals left and right, and being a famous female surfer, breaking the stereotype, and gaining the glory for women everywhere is part of Anne Marie's dream.In the mix, she winds up meeting Matt Tollman (Matthew Davis), an NFL quarterback in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Both individuals catch the eye of each other, but don't immediately strike up any flirtatious behavior because both have other things on their mind. Overtime, however, the two drift towards each other and wind up becoming closer, with Anne Marie's resistance always remaining in tact, as she doesn't want to be another hilarious story for Matt to tell his teammates when he gets back to the mainlands. However, Anne Marie finds out she may need Matt for the motivation and encouragement that she finds difficult to provide herself with, despite being highly-qualified and filled with talent.Blue Crush features some superbly photographed surfing scenes, shot with crisp, directorial command by Stockwell and made clear and evocative thanks to the cinematographical work of David Hennings. The final twenty minutes of the film are some of the most electric scenes of surfing I have yet to see, and work wonderfully in terms of shifting the focus away from what could be sentimental romance fluff into something truly breathtaking and original.At the end of the day, however, Blue Crush, while harmless, is also pretty simplistic; it's bears a very surface depiction of its characters despite not having the predictable pitfalls of its genre. Bosworth accentuates a nice charm, and the way that Stockwell and Weiss avoid the easier route is a commendable feat, on top of all the lush photography, but there's not enough drama that is gripping enough to invest in that doesn't seem oversimplified or voided by a lack of conversation in the film. Blue Crush serves as more intriguing basic entertainment than a great deal of other films made during or after its time, mainly due to the way it nicely avoids convention, yet there's still not a great deal of substance here outside of the fact that the predictably absorbing love interest doesn't monopolize the entire film on arrival.Starring: Kate Bosworth, Matthew Davis, Michelle Rodriguez, Sanoe Lake, Mika Boorem, and Faizon Love.

To Rome With Love," From Woody With Wit
","To Rome With Love isn't as intoxicating or as unanimously pleasing as his previous effort, Midnight in Paris, but it does provide us with some joyously, aesthetically pleasing escapism to warrant a recommendation. Allen is seventy-six years old, and still has quicker timing than many directors attempting to channel him and has been churning out a film nearly every year since 1969. With prolific qualities come some lesser works, but the film isn't lesser as much as collectively adequate.With that phrase, I mean the film, as a whole, knows what it wants to do, is fully consumed in that idea, and sets off to accomplish its task. It has itself together. Yet, despite a rather respectable effort, it doesn't work on every level or ones that it necessarily should. The story is composed of four vignettes, none of which finding cutesy ways to intertwine with one another (probably the best option), and is complimented by an ensemble cast.One of the first stories centers around Hayley (Alison Pill), who is visiting Rome and falls in love at first sight with Michelangelo (Flavio Parenti). She quickly decides she wants to live with him in Italy, and her parents, Phyllis (Judy Davis) and Jerry (Woody Allen), fly straight over to meet him. Allen's Jerry scores big laughs at every turn, as he complains about the turbulence on the plane, his disdain for pleasure in places, and his immediate write-off of Michelangelo that he is a Communist. Jerry soon discovers that the man's father (Fabio Armiliato, a real life opera singer) has a profound voice, but is self-conscious, untapped, and can only perfect his singing in the shower. This generates the offbeat qualities that only Allen himself can play with a straight face.Another centers around Jesse Eisenberg's Jack, a studying architect who bumps into famed architect, John, played by Alec Baldwin. Baldwin knows what it feels like to be in Jack's shoes, and he discovers that Jack is dating Sally (Greta Gerwig) and seems to have his life under control. In walks her friend Monica (Ellen Page), and despite her pseudo-intellectual vibe and her overly detailed sex history, Jack begins to fall in love with her, and refuses to take the warning sings from John.The two others follow Milly (Alessandra Mastronardi) and Antonio (Alessandro Tiberi), a newlywed couple residing in Rome, when through a series of rather silly and uninspired events, lands Antonio in bed with a gorgeously voluptuous prostitute named Anna (Penélope Cruz), who he must now pass off as his wife, Milly, while the real Milly is being smitten by her favorite actor. The setup is corny, but provides for a nice farce and some chuckles along the way. The weakest story is oddly the one with the most ambition, and it revolves around the seemingly normal Leopoldo (Roberto Benigni), who is just a regular Joe with a regular wife and two kids. Out of nowhere, in the blink of an eye, he becomes famous and renowned for the simple things he does every day, like shaving and sleeping on his back. While the vignette is clearly synonymous with the fact at how so many undeserving people are 'famous' for doing things that are unworthy of recognition and just being themselves, the comedic value is tiresome, the satire is there at the same time it isn't, and Benigni himself becomes rather uninspired as time goes on.The cast works wonders together, mainly Eisenberg and Page who create a likable chemistry and spark untold possibilities from the start. But the scene-stealer from the first frame is Woody Allen, who returns to the acting position after six years. His presence here immediately sparks for some delightfully awkward interactions with his family, as well as some 'you either get it or you don't' jokes that Allen seems able to produce effortlessly.Rome is projected through a lens of credible elegance and warmth, not to mention a true respect for the culture and the character it possesses. To Rome With Love adds to Allen's ongoing European travelogue, and while it certainly isn't his strongest efforts, his lovable vibes are still visible through the sea of sheer craft.Starring: Woody Allen, Alec Baldwin, Roberto Benigni, Penélope Cruz, Judy Davis, Jesse Eisenberg, Greta Gerwig, and Ellen Page.

Bridesmaids," Women rule in 2011
","When it comes to comedies, anyone can be the star. Women rule in Bridesmaids, and boy do they make some movie characters, like the wolf pack in The Hangover seem well behaved. Judd Apatow, the comedy wizard he is in the 2000's, has made realistic teen films like Superbad and dramas with comedic relief like Funny People. He is a multi-talented screenwriter, director, and producer, and his charm is shown off in Bridesmaids.Bridesmaids proves that women aren't as calm and collective as some other comedies make them out to be. They are not always waiting to pay the guys' bail when they do something that gets them thrown in the brig. They sometimes debate how they will get out of the brig. Hall Pass showed women can have more fun than the males, and Bridesmaids shows women can have fun doing the men's job. 2011 is definitely the year of the women.The plot: Annie (Wiig) is a failed bakery owner who's best friend Lillian (Rudolph) is getting married. Annie anticipates she will be the maid of honor, but feels shoved to the side when Helen (Byrne), the groom's boss, begins to takeover and plan the wedding the way she sees it.Annie, Lillian, and Helen are accompanied by Rita (McLendon-Covey), the foul-mouthed mother of three, and the hilarious Megan (McCarthy), the chubby and outspoken hilarity of the group which derives from her quick-witted remarks and very relatable attitude to some women.Knowing a lot of my mom's friends, I could pretty much play 'who's who' and put them in the roles of the cast. I had everyone with a secondary part and an extra laugh at every joke beside everyone in the theater.If cut appropriately, Bridesmaids cut fit on Saturday Night Live, the show Kristen Wiig is currently cast on, called something like Revenge of the Bride Buffoons. Wiig is extremely talented, and seeing her in Adventureland, Extract, and Paul I can say I've never seen a bad movie with her in it. We can all forget MacGruber ever happened.Even with Apatow only producing the film, it still delivers the charm and relatable characters seen in every one of his films. Besides having tons of comedy, there always is some sort of human-being essence to these characters showing them as more than just actors with lines, but pre-existing characters that are three dimensional. It is almost more than a movie.Apatow is currently working on an HBO show, which is looking interesting, called Girls about a group of twenty something females and their separate lives. It seems like a younger Sex and the City, and if it keeps the format like Bridemaids, odds are it will be funny and clever.Bridesmaids proves women can be just a vulgar, obscene, hilarious, and dirty as men. It is by no means a chick flick, more like a raunchy comedy with a heart. It lovable even at its most disgusting scenes. Even the dress fitting scene is hilarious as well as disgusting. It is one big mix of fun.Starring: Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne, Wendi McLendon-Covey, Ellie Kemper, Melissa McCarthy, Chris O'Dowd, and Terry Crews.

Meet the Fockers," Makes the original film look worthy of praise
","The only thing worse than an unnecessary sequel is a sequel that can't figure out anything new or invigorating to do with its material, so it resorts to recycling the same structure, humor, and plot-points from the original film. Meet the Fockers is a uniformly lazy picture, yet only slightly placing itself a few notches below its grossly overrated predecessor. The film all but affirms the purpose of its franchise's existence is to subject Ben Stiller to one lifeless comedic setpiece after another, to make Robert De Niro a continuously intolerable character, and to take a cast that practically oozes personality and make them a boring assortment of caricatures.It all starts with the rehashed plot; this time, instead of Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) meeting his fiancée Pam Byrnes' (Teri Polo) parents, and enduring the awkwardness and uncertainty that follows, Pam, her notoriously strict father Jack (Robert De Niro), and her mother Dina (Blythe Danner) will travel from Oyster Bay, New York to Long Island by RV to meet Greg's mother and father. Also going along for the ride is Little Jack, Jack's one-year-old nephew who he simultaneously cuddles and teaches how to be a grown up despite still being an infant.One of the first shocks to Greg's family is, despite Greg being so controlling and tightly wound, Greg's parents, Bernie and Roz (Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand), are so liberal and relaxed. The two welcome Jack and Dina with open arms, despite an evident behavioral shock taking place during casual conversation, as Bernie and Roz love to be open and free to discuss sex with their friends. Real drama, however, sets in when Greg reconnects with his old housekeeper Isabel Villalobos (Alanna Ubach), whom he slept with at a young age. Isabel now has a son that looks mysteriously like Greg and was birthed in a window similar to when him and Isabel slept together. As one can imagine, this causes immense discomfort between Greg and Pam, all while Jack is still trying to get Greg to fess up, as he believes he still isn't nearly as honest as he claims to be.The overblown nature of these films is what kills their vibe; their unsubtle humor works against every joke in a way that discredits the situation and the subsequent events. These films would work much better had to been conducted on a realistic scale, but when you have a cat who can flush a toilet, a baby who hears over three dozen simple words a day, yet his first word is a polysyllabic profanity, Greg's parents are such mind-numbing dolts who have no idea how to treat guests, and their is the possibility of an illegitimate son nobody spoke about, then the film becomes so far off course in its narrative it might as well be science-fiction.Furthermore, Meet the Fockers, as you'd expect, cops out with over a dozen jokes about Greg's birthname of 'Gaylord Focker.' This shows nothing else besides lazy writing on part of Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg, as they continue to cherrypick elements from the previous film. However, if Meet the Parents was good for anything, aside from being a sitcom display of humor, it was also slightly original and tapped into the nervewracking idea most men have when it comes to meeting their girlfriend or fiancée's parents. It reached out and explored that often unexplored area of anxiety and nervousness that stems from what should theoretically be a very positive and respectful time for both parties. However, due to the desire to not only impress, but wow, there is a discernible level of anxiety that takes over and frequently makes the first couple interactions so awkward and unsettling.Yet Meet the Parents, as stated, what a sitcom display of such events; a bogus, redundant collection of overblown scenarios that Meet the Fockers replicates in an even more mediocre fashion. Talent that has proved themselves worthy of high recognition succumbs to the repetitive nature of situational antics, most of which fall flat on their face and provide nothing else for the characters to do besides frantically run around and scream bloody murder at every turn. Meet the Fockers is a monotonous exercise that, in turn, makes its mediocre predecessor appear worth of praise.Starring: Ben Stiller, Teri Polo, Robert De Niro, Blythe Danner, Dustin Hoffman, Barbara Streisand, and Alanna Ubach.

Before Sunset," Man, it's great to be alive
","Initially, I had planned to watch Richard Linklater's Before trilogy in three days, watching one film after another. However, upon viewing Before Sunrise, along with writing the review, I took note that this trilogy was about time, time progression, and how people respond with being in company with one another for either an extended period of time or, in contrast, a relatively short period of time sporadically. I thought in order to make the trilogy bear a wee bit more relevance and realism for me, as a viewer, seeing as impatiently waiting nine years between each film to see them in theaters was an option I missed, I'd distance each film by about two weeks (and with the amount of films I watch in between, there would hopefully be little obsessing over what happens to the characters in between that time). My confession to you, the reader, is that it took all of my strength not to watch Before Sunset sooner than I had scheduled it; Before Sunrise is the kind of film that blindsides you so greatly, and tickles your human spirit so tenderly, that when it's over, knowing there's more films of the like makes you want to seek those others out immediately. Unfortunately, I had to exercise some restraint in the process to at least add some personal realism to this series; like I was impatiently waiting with these characters to see one another again.Before Sunset picks up exactly nine years after the events of Before Sunrise, which focused on an American man named Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and a Frenchwoman named Céline (Julie Delpy) met aboard a train in Vienna and spent the entire day roaming and conversing through the city, agreeing to meet nine years later in the same place. Jesse is back overseas, however, this time in Paris, doing a book tour for the novel he wrote about his encounter with Céline and how it changed his life. During the book tour, he runs into Céline, shocked as can be, as he recalls how their original meeting didn't go as scheduled because she presumably forgot about their agreement to meet. It turns out, a personal tragedy occurred in Céline's life, making her unable to meet up with him. Now, however, they are together and spend a brief but glorious day in Paris together, again, roaming the streets talking about philosophy, personal happiness, their own lives, their own musings, and so forth, all captured under the beautiful streets and attractions that Paris has to offer.Hawke and Delpy have officially made themselves comfortable in the roles of Jesse and Céline. In this effort, they seem more relaxed with one another, especially Hawke, who has made his character assume more of a pleasantly comic role, but never to any particular fault. Delpy's character, on the other hand, has grown more cynical to the idea of love and attraction, remarking how the past two guys she dated wound up breaking up with her and finding love immediately following the break up. 'Why couldn't they ask me to marry them?,' she asks Jesse, in a crying fit in a taxi, 'I would've said 'no,' but the least they could've done was ask.' Jesse, on the other hand, is married with a kid, and breathlessly doing a handful of book tours. He's not happy, surprisingly enough, but just passively content with his life. He admits his marriage isn't provided with the romantic/fairy-tale idealism that he's madly in love with the person he sleeps with every day, but that he respects, cares for, and trusts his wife as a person, which, he believes, is what it comes down to ultimately. However, any thinking person can see what Jesse and Céline share is true love. After nine years of no contact, and not even knowing each others last names of full backgrounds, the two can assimilate back into a particular environment and pick up a conversation that's laid dormant for nine years as if it was just discussed on the previous day. On top of that, it's important to note how comfortable the two souls are around one another, sharing personal opinions and diving into past experiences in a way that only happens with one other person once in a blue moon. If you can recall one experience you've had with another person where you and them divulged personal details with one another because you felt explicitly comfortable and safe in their presence, you are an incredibly lucky soul. If you can hold on to that, you're an even more fortunate person.Before Sunset, above all, is a continuation of Linklater's fascination and study of time and human interaction. He has constructed two very interesting and complex characters and has given them the ability to reconnect with one another every nine years. With that, he toys with settings, ideas, and philosophies, and essentially uses these two souls to communicate thoughts and ideas about how we interact and how times heals, impacts, and effects all of us, especially our relationships, in different ways. Before Sunset is a beautiful continuation; a love-letter and joyous appreciation for the human spirit, with two great actors even more adjusted and oriented to their roles than ever before, leaving for seventy-seven minutes of rich and potent dialog. If you don't extract something from this film, or feel something, I may need to check you for a pulse.Starring: Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. Directed by: Richard Linklater.",10,1,2,14 March 2015
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," We ain't got the regular here
","I had the pleasure of seeing this on demand using the Xbox Live: Zune Marketplace. Some independent films, that aren't going or are going to very limited theaters, release their films on demand to outlets like Zune, DirecTV, and Pay-Per View to try and get more money before the DVD comes out. I've seen numerous films on Zune like Conan O'Brien Can't Stop, Red State, and many others. It's a very nice privilege to see something you can't in theaters.I praise this new on demand feature because many of the independent films I've seen off of it deserve to have a wide release, but don't get one. Tucker and Dale vs. Evil is truly a great, fresh look at comedy/horror as it parodies cabin style horror films like Cabin Fever, The Hills Have Eyes, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It does it with a good sense of gore and a good sense of humor. Both combinations duplicated a lot in modern horror, but many fail to succeed.The plot: Tucker (Tudyk) and Dale (Levine) are two backwoods-hillbillies that are as simple as can be. They buy their 'dreamhouse' in the middle of the woods, which is just a beaten up shack. They are satisfied, and want to fix the house up to fulfill their long time dream.Meanwhile, a group of College kids travel up to the same woods to drink, party, and skinny-dip in a swamp in the middle of the night. Tucker and Dale go swimming late at night when they see a girl, in her bra and underwear, about to jump into swampy water. Because girls love to strip down to nothing in the middle of the woods to go skinny-dipping. Seeing Tucker and Dale surprises her and she falls backwards hitting her head.Tucker and Dale rescue her, and try to alert the group of kids by saying 'We got your friend' which only achieves scaring the kids and having them run for the hills. The remainder is a series of misunderstandings with the hillbillies looking like serial killers, and the College kids trying to rescue their friend. The misunderstandings aren't very far-fetched, and they almost have a Final Destination appearance to them of people unintentionally dying.Being that this film is sort of the first of its kind, it doesn't have a formula and had to be designed by screenwriters Eli Craig and Morgan Jurgenson. It works. The combinations of gore, humor, and scares are all put into very fair and balanced doses. The film is never cocky, and is always fast-paced and entertaining.Independent horror films will more than likely dominate the growing market. Modern horror films aren't going anywhere but back to the past, and even some former limited release films like Paranormal Activity are being blown out of proportion with sequels and budget-increases. Tucker and Dale vs. Evil is as innocent as its title characters - but they continue to deliver edgy laughs and scares.Starring: Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine.

Foxcatcher," A profoundly affecting film, as low-key as it manages to be
","Bennett Miller's 'Foxcatcher' opens along the lines of a mumblecore film, with little dialog and brief sequences establishing the ho-hum routine of somebody we would think would live a more intriguing and layered life. For the film's first fifteen minutes, we follow the routine of Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum), an Olympic gold-medalist in wrestling who is now wading in the water for something to either come to him or him to find something to go to. These are a profound fifteen minutes, low-key and substantive in the regard that even somebody we fable and could possibly model ourselves after still goes through the checklist of ordinary things in his daily life: eating alone at a small, fold-up table in his apartment, eating fast food in his car, practicing at your average wrestling gym, and so forth. During these fifteen minutes, dialog is rare and we are captivated by the ambiance of Mark's surroundings and the bleak way Miller and cinematographer Greig Fraser (cinematographer for 'Zero Dark Thirty') capture his environment.One day, Mark is contacted by a representative for John Eleuthère du Pont, a multimillionaire philanthropist who wants to meet with him at once. Mark travels to du Pont's lavish home, where he informs him of his patriotism and his love for the sport of wrestling, and offers to coach Mark for his wrestling team known as 'Foxcatcher,' where they would travel and compete in wrestling tournaments all around the world. Mark contacts his older brother Dave (Mark Ruffalo), who has settled down with a wife and kids and, while he doesn't want to drop everything to join a wrestling team, supports his brother, for he sees that his brother's life has become a drudgery of existing rather than living. Mark accepts du Pont's offer and travels out to work under his grueling, yet motivating practices to hopefully become 'the greatest wrestler in the world,' a title that Mark has long-desired.John du Pont is played by Steve Carell in one of his most fascinating and bizarre roles to date. Carell is buried under a plethora of facial prosthetics, giving his face a fatter, aged look to it, with gray, scaley-skin, thinning hair, little to no eyebrows, and a large, protruding nose. While, at first, you're distracted by Carell's getup, he overcomes one of the toughest hurdles in his acting career, which is getting you to look past the heavy use of makeup and manipulation to look at the character instead. Carell has always been an intriguing character actor to watch, taking comedy and drama roles, weaving in and out of them beautifully, like a younger Robin Williams. Here, he gives a haunting and unpredictable performance of a character that never seems fully relaxed and never quite stable.Tatum and Ruffalo both shine in their respective roles as well, especially Tatum, who finally has found a role that allows him to show off his brawn as well as his ability to act and maintain an on-screen composure. Tatum has been one of my favorite leading males for years, and anytime somebody criticizes him of being an actor who's sole purpose is eye-candy needs to watch this film and eat their words. Tatum gives a visceral performance here, and one almost as haunting as Carell's, but in a different way. Tatum's performance is rooted more in ritualistic behaviors, including displays of uncontrollable anger when certain things do not work out, like when he's considerably overweight for a particular match. Frequently, Tatum's character engages in self-mutilation by punching and thrusting himself into a mirror, which turns out to be much more frightening then it sounds.'Foxcatcher' is a terrific adult drama because it's so rare to see a film so low-key in its themes and its display of events, yet so effective in delivering a wild true story with all the punch it needs. Its only real misstep is how little we know about du Pont's deteriorating mental state at the end, and because of that, the ending comes out of nowhere, as if Miller and writers E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman didn't offer enough development or foreshadowing as to something like what occurred was about to take place. Furthermore, du Pont's character is sort of left as an enigma throughout the whole film, which may have been what he was like in real life to the brothers Schultz, but it becomes a bit of a contradiction, as the film tries to humanize the Schultz's yet leave du Pont cast in shadow.However, this small feature still doesn't obscure the fact that 'Foxcatcher' is one of the strongest adult dramas of the year, and has a collection of some of the year's finest performances all in one film.",8,32,55,27 December 2014
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," A moodier take on an instant classic
","Despite having perhaps one of the worst sequel titles in film history, The Lost World: Jurassic Park winds up being a favorable dinosaur outing. One of the pleasant things about the Jurassic Park franchise is that dinosaur films are few and far between, which allows for the ideas and sequences in these films to remain mostly fresh. There's little interference with 'been there, done that' responses to action setpieces, nor is there a general cynicism to the tones of these films or the imagery (which gets especially moodier in this film). The wonder and elements of peril are still firmly instilled in Spielberg's direction and David Koepp's screenplay, making for a film that continues to really emphasize the thrill of its predecessor through nearly every scene.We focus on Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), who is hired by InGen CEO John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) to document the activities of the dinosaurs on Hammond's second Jurassic Park site after the terrible breakdown of his first site before financiers close the second park. Initially apprehensive, Malcolm turns compliant when he sees his paleontologist girlfriend Sarah (Julianne Moore) packed up and ready to go, in addition to his daughter Kelly (Vanessa Lee Chester) from his first marriage. On the trip, Malcolm winds up meeting an ecological film crew run by Vince Vaughn's Nick as well as a famous hunter known as Roland Tembo (Pete Postlethwaite). As expected, however, the same catastrophe that occurred in the first park repeats itself with the second, making for a frightening and dangerous experience for the long-suffering individuals who recall Jurassic Park's initial failure all too well.The sole thing The Lost World does better than its predecessor is give us a group of more interesting characters and character actors. Seeing Goldblum, Moore, and Vaughn work off one another in a way that channels misfit tendencies very nicely is something to relish, for seeing all these actors in such a goofy, fun-loving project makes the price of admission already worth it. This band of characters, while still not entirely fleshed out, is still a lot better than the marginally amusing cast of characters from the first movie, which benefited largely from the effortless charisma of the everyman Wayne Knight.Still instilled in The Lost World from the original Jurassic Park film is the film's desire to keep us feeling constant danger and uncertainty. Jurassic Park's main attraction, besides state-of-the-art special effects, was the fact that it always made us feel at the mercy of enormous, hulking dinosaurs, regardless of where we tried to hide (or where the camera place us). Spielberg clearly capitalizes on this principle with this particular film, giving us the feeling of minimal safety he did with not only this film's predecessor, but his other projects like Duel and Poltergeist.Then there's the element of darkness in this film that's significantly more present here than it was in the first film. Rather than encapsulating the common attributes of flashy, summer blockbusters, The Lost World finds itself assuming a moodier state of mind, actively showing innocent bystanders consumed by dinosaurs, young people mauled by baby dinosaurs, and more. There's a flood of action and suspenseful sequences that really amount to some fully realized events in this film. Consider the scene when Kelly performs a complex gymnastics routine to save Malcolm and Sarah, or when the dinosaurs are attacking the film crew and Malcolm works to rescue them.In some ways, The Lost World finds ways to be more engaging than Jurassic Park. Its moodier style further exploits the dangers of dinosaurs, and the repeated peril that humans face when trying to assimilate to their world. The Lost World: Jurassic Park continues to affirm this frightening realization while remaining a thrilling piece of blockbuster entertainment, never squandering the opportunity to be dark and violent but also peppering in the occasional one-liner (some funny, some cringe-worthy) for good measure. Much like its predecessor, this is ultimately a variation on the summer blockbuster done well and in a consistently enjoyable manner.Starring: Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, Vanessa Lee Chester, Vince Vaughn, Pete Postlethwaite, and Richard Attenborough.

It Follows," Even through shortcomings and mixed ideas, the film's heart is always evident
","Right before I saw David Robert Mitchell's 'It Follows' at my local theater, I was greeted with previews for forthcoming supernatural horror films like 'Before I Wake,' 'Insidious: Chapter 3,' and the remake of 'Poltergeist,' all of which could've probably taken clips from one another and I wouldn't have even noticed. This is how basic and thoroughly unimpressive horror has gotten over the last few years and why we need to support films like this one. Is 'It Follows' worthy of such praise along the lines of 'the best horror film of the decade,' 'one of the scariest films ever made,' and so forth? Sadly, no. I sometimes think critics either speak too soon or simply want to see their name stamped before advertisements, claiming such outlandish assertions that could not only be disingenuous to their actual viewpoints but, in turn, set unrealistic expectations up for films that leave the audiences disappointed.Make no mistake however, for 'It Follows' is definitely worth seeing and is bound to be one of the strongest horror films of the year. Even if we consider its few shortcomings and some instances of serious monotony, I'm more than happy to support this little festival darling and commend it for what it does well. As I stated, just before you settle into watch the film, you'll more than likely see previews for horror films made by people and studios who have simply stopped trying to make good, memorable films and copped out at settling for mediocrity. Here's to a film that went left when most of the pack went right.After an opening sequence that hooks you from how absurd it is, we focus on Jay and Hugh (Maika Monroe and Jake Weary), a couple of twentysomethings out on a movie date. In the theater, Hugh notices a woman in a yellow dress, who apparently cannot be seen by Jay or anyone else, and orders her out of the theater. When the two are alone in their car, following sex, Hugh takes a chloroform rag to Jay, knocking her unconscious and ties her to a wheelchair. It's here when Hugh informs Jay that something has been following him for a long time but only he can see it. It often appears to be a naked woman, but can take the form of anyone, even the people you know and love, and passing it on occurs by having sex with another person. The soul will follow whomever is affected by its curse at walking pace, and if it catches up to Jay, it will kill her, and proceed to go after Hugh.'It Follows' is an early candidate for one of the most beautifully shot films of the year, and more than likely to be the most beautiful looking horror film of 2015. It has a delightful moodiness to its cinematography, captured crisply by Mike Gioulakis, as it uses a dark purple, gray, and teal color palette to look simultaneously uninviting and immersing. Colors like blood red boom with the feel and visual power that echoes Dario Argento, almost like an homage to 'Suspiria' in look and feel. The story moves with the kind of slowburn intensity we've seen from horror directors John Carpenter and Wes Craven, or even Ti West, if we're talking more contemporary.The real aesthetic treat here is how Disasterpeace's music combines with the film's cinematography. The use of heavy, bass-rattling synthesizers makes the film look and operate like a horror film of the 1980's to the point where looming tension becomes almost overcompensating in the way it appears to be taking over the entire film. The synths are loud and unsettling, and at times, can really propel the film to a suspenseful climax. Other times, however, they are obnoxious for the sake of being obnoxious and slightly disrupt the tonality Mitchell sets by making the film operate on a low-key playing field.While the plot appears confusing, 'It Follows' is surprising in how little there really is to it. Teenagers walk around, run from ostensibly nothing, comfort one another through sex and aimless conversations, and assure one another that it will all be okay amongst discussing different ways to combat this force. It's almost like Larry Clark made another horror film, as the tonal shifts feel like they're almost part of a coming of age film in addition to a horror film. These shifts aren't bad, however, as they function nicely to the film's more suspenseful elements by slowing the action down but never coming to a grinding halt. There's an unevenness, but it's not made as apparent as one would presume.I find this is largely because of how well everyone works together here. With Gioulakis evoking consuming cinematography, Disasterpeace emphasizing a score that's alive and intense, Mitchell taking screen writing and directorial risks for his genre (employing long, clean shots that provide for a beautiful sense of location), 'It Follows' is sound on almost all fronts. The only negatives that arise from the film are occasional structural burdens, or the fact that, towards the end of the film, its idea seems to change to fit the situation and create something unexpected.Nonetheless, 'It Follows' is a film to see and support, for it's one of those many opportunities we have as consumers that we keep blowing to see quality entertainment. It's almost like voting in elections; vote now and hopefully experience something that will satisfy you in the future. Even if 'It Follows' isn't the perfect gem some have claimed, I'd rather see a pretty good independent horror film than a mediocre or downright abysmal carbon-copy that's spit into 3,000+ theaters with nothing but money in mind. There's heart in 'It Follows' and that, at all times, is evident.",8,77,145,30 March 2015
Cars," Heartfelt and sincere - my favorite Pixar film
","It's odd to think my favorite Pixar film is the one everyone hates or finds inferior to every other film by them. Many people will not understand why I love this film so much, but I'm sure every person has my same love for a film not many people enjoy either. It is a very personal thing, but I loved Cars. It is as good as the first Toy Story movie.Pixar pumps so much life into their films, and they seem to come out so quickly. Cars came out about a year after The Incredibles, and at that time I assume people expected saw Cars has an awkwardly made film. They're cars. They talk and they have heartfelt conversations. I think maybe talking toys, monsters, bugs, and a superhero family were a bit more understandable.The plot is that Lightning McQueen (Voiced by Owen Wilson), a race car, just tied with Chick Hicks (Keaton) in their latest race. McQueen's pit crew is now traveling to Los Angeles for the tie-breaker race, as well as McQueen, until the truck carrying McQueen falls asleep and McQueen falls out the back.McQueen lands in a near desolate town called Radiator Springs. It's an old fashioned town where all the cars know each other, they all knew their customers, and they were all active workers at one point. Ramone (Marin) runs the body shop, Flo (Lewis) runs a diner, Mater (Cable Guy) runs the tow-truck business, Sally (Hunt) runs a motel, Luigi (Shalhoub) and Guido (Quaroni) run an auto repair shop, and Fillmore (Carlin) runs an oil shop. The town is run by a grumpy old race car named Doc Hudson (Newman) who is hiding a secret himself.The tow-truck Mater tries to become friends with a reluctant McQueen who just sees everybody as losers and himself as a winner. The film teaches a lesson in friendship and staying close to the people you love. The big moral; winning isn't everything.Cars comes equipped with a 'back in the day' style that works in its favor. In the fifties and sixties, like Sally said 'Cars didn't drive on it (the old highway) to make good time. They drove on it to have a good time.' Now that a highway has been constructed so that it runs right past Radiator Springs, it doesn't get very many, if any, customers and is almost running to the end of its lifespan.The soundtrack for the film spits two memorable tracks that flow perfectly with the film. Rascal Flats covers Life is a Highway, once sung by Tom Cochrane, and adds a very zesty and fast paced quality to the song. It's exciting and very fitting to a film like this. Cars also features the tear-jerker by James Taylor, Our Town. While playing it, it shows flashbacks when Radiator Springs' business was better than ever and very profitable.I have a certain love-affair with this movie I can't explain too well. It's a campy and fun movie with a lot of positive, and sad, qualities. The characters, while cars, manage to enter your heart and never leave. And as always, Pixar does exceptionally well when it comes to animation and scenery. It can almost bring back such memories when you were seven years old, and your cars had a mind of their own. You'd race them around using your hands in your bedroom using your own personal sound effect system - your mouth. I'm not accusing you of doing it, I did it too. Cars revives those memories.Voiced by: Owen Wilson, Larry the Cable Guy, Paul Newman, Bonnie Hunt, Tony Shalhoub, John Ratzenberger, George Carlin, Jenifer Lewis, Cheech Marin, Richard Petty, Joe Ranft, and Michael Keaton.

Behind The Candelabra," The enigma is overpowering me
","I would not want to be the person shopping around a serious script in Hollywood about the life of the famous pianist Liberace. It would be the toughest of sells to a culture that would likely feel the material is too dry and the demand too little. A slightly campier script, with luxurious set design and intimate portrayals of characters the public wouldn't likely know about is what I'd like to get my hands on. The story of Liberace is stranger than fiction and dryer, more serious material could've corrupted its overall goals and ambitions.The film with the campier script, luxurious set designs, and intimate portrayals is Steven Soderbergh's Behind the Candelabra, a wonderful, limitless look at the life of Liberace, an enigma in every sense of the word. In addition to playing many sold-out shows, the man had a lovelife like no other at the time, meeting and becoming fast friends with Scott Thorson, an aspiring veterinarian who was quickly made his lover. Thorson seemed to have a genuine understanding of the loneliness and lack of friendship Liberace had and provided him with great talks, great compassion, and great sex.The relationship, however, resulted in drug addiction, intense plastic surgery, lies, mistrust, and ended with a lawsuit. Soderbergh and writer Richard LaGravenese don't hesitate to explore this and make it one of the deepest focuses in the picture. The relationships the men had had the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. The scenes when they are together in a hot tub are human and romantic. The scenes when they are fighting are heartbreaking because you realize that these men haven't just come so far to make their relationship work but losing each other after so long would be detrimental to their self-esteems and egos. They complete each other and that's where the magic is at its strongest.Liberace is played by Michael Douglas in one of the bravest roles of his career. So brave and powerful that it's unfortunate that because of the film's TV movie status it is ineligible for an Academy Award nomination. Douglas is an actor who is never conventional with his role choice. The same man who played a common-man pushed off a cliff of sanity, an executive victim to a consuming, real-life game, and a worried father of a drug-addicted daughter is the same man playing a middle-aged, flamboyant pianist with a love for wonder, music, and men. The diversity in role choice is stunning.Matt Damon appears at his youngest as Liberace's lover Scott, in an equally conflicted, complex performance. Damon fills the shoes of the role beautifully and effectively, giving off much in the way of creative energy and heart as he shows just how stressed and torn Thorson must've been in a relationship with someone who truly loved and understood him but wanted to manipulate him. Supporting performances from Rob Lowe as Liberace's doctor, prescribing medicines to both him and Thorson and Dan Aykroyd as his manager are terrific and often are seen providing strong comic relief.For a TV movie to have the cinematography and atmosphere that Behind the Candelabra does is truly a feature worth nothing. It may not be as excessive as Baz Luhrmann's Great Gatsby - I don't expect anything of the next two years to be on par with that film - but rarely has a TV movie achieved such phenomenally vibrant and luscious standards. The only thing that could make it better is Soderbergh proving he knows how to work with it and he most certainly does.HBO seems to be the go-to network for biographical films about figures that wouldn't likely make appropriate return in the theaters (Behind the Candelabra especially considering the summer movie season has already hit the ground running). David Mamet, just a few months ago, directed the delightful and shockingly unbiased Phil Spector, with actors like Al Pacino and Helen Mirren receiving top-billing. Seeing as a Liberace biopic is directed by none other than Soderbergh, I wouldn't be surprised at seeing a slew of films about eclectic media figures being made and released on HBO in the next few years. Networks that have the drive and willingness to air these kinds of films are a necessity to the success of film.Starring: Michael Douglas, Matt Damon, Rob Lowe, and Dan Aykroyd.

Mr. Nobody," Gives us enough to chew on before we choke on it or spit it out
","Mr. Nobody concerns the complex principles of quantum mechanics of time, specifically the often-debated and discussed 'many-worlds theory,' which basically boils down to the possibility of numerous, external universes existing operating upon the choices you've never made yourself. Consider myself choosing to hang out with a friend of mine today after finishing my classes rather than working on schoolwork or my writing. Had I went home directly after finishing my classes, perhaps I would've gotten more of my schoolwork done, which could've resulted in better grades, which would've made my GPA higher, which would've potentially gotten me better job opportunities, which could've even made my income a bit higher.Of course, you could 'what if?' damn-near every circumstance of your life to the point where you can make yourself suicidal over what you could've done and what you wound up doing, but that's not healthy at all. The details of quantum mechanics have been softly examined in film for quite sometime (one film that immediately comes to mind is the opening monologue of Richard Linklater's Slacker delivered by Linklater himself from the back of a taxicab). However, rarely does a film muster up the ambition and conviction to tackle on the often headache-inducing ins and outs of such lofty ideas, which are nothing more than theories in scholarly articles that populate the internet.Writer/director Jaco Van Dormael apparently had enough confidence to concoct a lengthy screenplay and timeline around the idea and the result is Mr. Nobody, an admirably ambitious film that, like the very basic ideas of quantum mechanics, packs a great deal of ideas into a relatively small box and tries to make us chew on them long enough before we either choke or spit them out. We open in the year 2092, where humans are now immortal thanks to the endless renewal of cells; the last mortal on Earth is the 117-year-old Nemo Nobody (Jared Leto), who is edging ever-so-closely to death as society watches the last soul among them with the capability to die. A psychiatrist named Dr. Feldheim (Allan Corduner) manages to snag one final interview with Nemo before his imminent death, since Nemo also has a rare ability to account the past lives he could've lived had he made a different choice in a crucial situation as a young child.At the age of nine, Nemo had the choice of which parent he wanted to stay with after their separation. At first, we see him tardily hop aboard a train with his mother, where, in three separate story lines, he becomes smitten with a woman named Anna, in one world insulting her and her friends, at another point conversing with them, and another, marrying and raising children with her. Yet another alternate life shows the multitude of possibilities that could've happened had he stayed home and lived with his father, where Nemo meets an entirely new woman named Elise, who, in one story, is still in love with her boyfriend, but another, is bipolar and manic depressive, making Nemo's life a living hell.Mr. Nobody is anything but a linear experience; at two and a half hours in length, the film plays like a repetitive stageplay, exhausting every potential narrative possibility as it showcases every which way Nemo's life could've gone. We see situations repeat themselves, lines of dialog slightly altered to create a new scene, and through it all, Nemo Nobody, who has lived more lives to the fullest than we'll be lucky to live one. As narratively ambitious as this story is, shortcomings seem to plague or limit the film's greatness on a consistent basis. To begin with, Nemo isn't that engaging of a person, nor is Leto that expressive or interesting as a character actor to sustain a film as lofty or as long as this one. Nemo doesn't grab us in with his personality because, through many of his scenes, he's a passive presence; almost an accessory or a side-character to his own life. He doesn't seem too fazed by the multitude of things occurring in his life at any given moment, with limited facial and vocal expression, which makes it hard for us, the audience, to truly sympathize with him. With that, as stated, Leto doesn't bring a ton to the table as Nemo either; his presence is lacking the kind of engagement that protagonists usually possess, especially with such a liberal amount of runtime/screen time to work with, which results in a part of the film that sags dramatically.After some contemplation, that element seems to be Mr. Nobody's biggest issue. Other features - such as a narrative that repeats itself quite frequently, an almost inherently exhausting and maddening amount of existentialism to chew on, and a timeline that results in a viewer doing mental hopscotch to try to cogently understand it - are almost to be expected with a film dealing with quantum mechanics, so complaining about them, despite their presence, seems a bit foolish. In addition, overly emphasizing these attributes can greatly make one forget about the commendable ambition and scope Van Dormael possesses for his screenplay. He respects the screenplay enough to deeply consider the limitless possibilities of the many-worlds theory, to the point where I wished he would've focused on a more engaging presence instead of the flatter, less convincing protagonist we got with our titular character.Mr. Nobody has a whirlwind going for it in the conversational/post-credits discussion aspect, as most panels and debates about the many-worlds theory possess; it's getting to that point and enduring what we must endure that gets in the way of the ultimate reward, which is discussing and sharing our deepest, most personal thoughts.",6,1,4,23 February 2016
Django Unchained," It'll have me singing 'Djangoooooo' for a while now
","Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained rebounds where the ho-hum Inglourious Basterds sadly floundered. It's valid to dub this a companion piece to Basterds, seeing as it inhabits the same tone and plays along with the idea of revisionist history in ways the public never really thought imaginable. Quentin Tarantino has and will always be a genre-enthusiast, so we begin by addressing the fact that this film erects the style germane to spaghetti westerns of the 1950's and the 1960's (the title character, 'Django' is taken from the 1966 Sergio Corbucci film, who was originally played by Franco Nero, who has a cameo in this picture as well). Tarantino achieves the look and feel by incorporating easy-on-the-eyes cinematography, familiar close-ups, the gritty look of the Deep South, and the bold, audacious red-letters during the opening titles and part of the closing ones. The film is as stylistically potent as Tarantino has ever been.Our story (told in an unusually linear fashion) concerns Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave who is bought by the dentist turned bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), who has made a habit of listlessly wandering the terrain of the south, shooting those made famous on paper posters that are plastered all around town and proudly collecting the check. He teaches Django much of the same, how to protect himself and to conduct himself formally and ominously to evade certain doom in this time of intolerance and disrespect towards blacks.Django informs Dr. King Schultz of his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), and states both of them were separated when being bought by different men. Schultz discovers that Broomhilda was purchased by Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), a spoiled, sadistic animal who resides in a mansion called 'Candyland,' where black men are trained to fight (called 'Mandingos,' more commonly) and black woman are forced into prostitution.The first half of Django Unchained is shamelessly violent and provides nonstop hilarity, as both Django and Schultz get acquainted with one another and become two of the most charismatic duos in the 2012 year of film. The second half is when the film shows us its real roots, a revenge flick on one hand, but a love story on the other, as the two men arrive at Candyland, running into Candie and his loyal house-slave Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson in one of the most un-Samuel L. Jackson-like roles), and try to strike a deal to buy Broomhilda from Candie, while covering up the fact that both her and Django are married.There are three things I've grown to expect in a Tarantino project and they are all here and present. Number one is an unbelievable wealth of talent. From not only Foxx as the title character, but Christoph Waltz who gave arguably the performance of the decade in Inglourious Basterds, this film is wonderfully cast and the performers here are captivating as they inhabit characters of several personalities accentuating them professionally because of their solid dialog. DiCaprio plays a villain full of menace and evil, and the long sequence at dinner, where we truly see his uncompromising menace is where we see it unfold. And it must be reiterated that Samuel L. Jackson gives a terrifically unconventional performance here one could even dub a character actor role.Number two is a hard-hitting first act, a satisfying second act, but a rambling and repetitive third. Django Unchained runs about twenty minutes too long, and because of that, one who merely enjoys this picture on its own merits, who isn't a passionate cinephile nor a devoted Tarantino fan could become tired or bored. That's the problem when you've built up such a strong and loyal fanbase is that by giving them what you want so many times and in mass amounts, you run the risk of turning off people who've tried to connect or enjoy your work and you make it more difficult for those on the fence to appreciate it. I've long-admired Tarantino's love for cinema and his extremely entertaining pictures, but I have my limits for every director and while he knows how to give cinephiles what they adore, he too knows how to push many buttons.Number three is his love for movies and the little aesthetics that go behind making every film work. This is shown explicitly in Django Unchained. From the obscure music choices (Luis Bacalov for the opening, Rick Ross and Tupac for a montage or two), to the detailed settings, to the impervious script, Tarantino gathers everything that makes films memorable, stylish, potent experiences and uses them to this film's advantage.Finally, too much has been made about how 'racist' Django Unchained may be. The answer is in no way is this picture racist. It deals with racism, so perhaps people make too many feeble generalizations and forget to say that. As unabashedly violent and unapologetically gruesome certain sequences are, Tarantino constructs this picture elegantly and respectfully, often making the blacks smarter and more educated than the whites, and never shying away from the fact that slavery was a disgusting, inhumane act that has and will forever stain the fabric of humanity. To call this film racist for the sole purpose that it uses 'the n word' and features slavery and not addressing its plot, content, or direction is a misguided, terribly underfunded statement.To scale this as an entire film is a bit tricky. At times uneven and unbalanced, and at others, devilishly entertaining, incredibly raucous, and persistently bloody, Django Unchained is an obscure work of art. To simplify my recommendation, so as not to turn off potential viewers who've likely been rather turned off by the subject matter or whatnot, I must say, there's something hear for all too enjoy, cinephile or casual moviegoer. It'll have me singing 'Djangoooooo' for a while now.",8,3,14,28 December 2012
Insidious," Definitely an insidious horror film
","You definitely get what you pay for when you see Insidious. Loud booms, a unique premise, and quite a few good scares. It's definitely one of the better horror films I've seen in recent years. It beats the remakes of Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street by a long shot, but still doesn't match the intensity brought in a film like Frozen.The plot: Renai and Josh Lambert (Byrne and Wilson) and their three kids move into a new house which looks like it was built some time in the good ol' days. The eldest of the three kids, Dalton (Simpkins) ventures up to the attic to explore resulting in him falling off a ladder and hurting himself. When Josh can't wake Dalton up the next morning, he takes him to the hospital where we find out Dalton is in a coma after he hit his head when falling off the ladder.After three months, Dalton still hasn't woken up. He is now in The Lamberts' home for in home care. Now a number of paranormal events have been occurring. Renai starts to see different men at night, some resembling demons, and others looking like intruders. It begins to be a nightmare for the whole family.I don't want to go into too much of the story because I feel the less you know going into it the better. I saw this because I heard a few people online say 'it's the scariest film I've seen in years.' I thought I'd see it on the big screen to top it off. It was very effective and very eerie in it's own right, but not a lot is accomplished in it's hundred and two minute run time.We never get a lot of questions answered in the film. It's almost like Battle: Los Angeles. Why is the audience bribed of information? Many don't care, but for someone like me, I want to know pretty much every answer to my questions. But it's a horror film. I must really sound stupid for wanting background information.Insidious is not a slice 'em dice 'em fest so don't go in expecting 'From the MAKERS of Paranormal Activity and Saw' to go very far. Director James Wan took a little paranormal twist with this and doesn't give us tiresome torture porn or bangs and booms as main scares. He adds bite to his bark.Starring: Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Barbara Hershey, Andrew Astor, and Leigh Whannell. Directed by: James Wan.",8,3,7,10 April 2011
Frozen," A classic for the new generation
","Is it wrong to have walked into Frozen with such high expectations? Just a week after writing a lengthy blog about how one of the defining meanings behind my consistently gray wardrobe is to represent neutrality before entering a film even with numerous forces that allow for judgment and opinion-forming to occur I entered Frozen with a very high bar in place that I was hoping it would live up to.This is where my recognition for separate forces intruding on ones open-minded approach to a film comes in. Frozen has been in wide release in America since November 2013, is one of only eighteen films to gross $1 billion - one of the five to be an original product and unrelated to a preexisting franchise - has made prominence by its effervescent soundtrack, has been ubiquitous in many toy-store aisles, and is currently topping the favorite film list by the same young girls who can't even keep count of how many times they've seen it thus far.Based on that astounding resume, even with the high standards and the factor of the animation bar being raised within the last decade or so, I think having higher expectations for Frozen isn't such a wrongheaded thing. The only issue is that when a film is positioned in this high of a light over time, and one hasn't the film until much later in its run, it sets up a bigger opportunity to disappoint than it does to impress thanks to unintentionally higher expectations based on exposure and praise.Let's cut to the chase, though - I found myself really enjoying Frozen overall, admiring the remarkable beauty in its visuals, the memorable songs sung throughout the film, the eccentric and, for the most part, lovable characters, and the warm feel it provided consistently reminiscent of the Disney princess films of yesteryear. To put it simply, this is Beauty and the Beast/The Lion King level quality for the new generation.Without spending too much time on the story, the film centers around Elsa, the Princess of Arendelle, who has the magical power to create snow and ice from thin air, and Anna, her younger sister. Anna and Elsa have held something of a cold (no pun intended) relationship since childhood, growing more and more distant and shunning one another after an accident induced by playing when they were young kids. Yet now that she's older, Elsa has caused a yearlong winter, much to the dismay of Anna, who takes it upon herself to travel to her older sister's coronation and break her infinite cold spell as well as mend their relationship.Along the way, Anna meets the likes of Kristoff, an avid climber whose only real friend is Sven, a loyal moose, as well as meeting Olaf, an eccentric and cheery snowman who wishes to experience the wondrous qualities of summertime. While embarking on this dangerous but worthwhile quest, Anna contemplates whether or not to marry Hans, the Prince of Southern Isles, who she feels she has fallen in true love with after only meeting him for a short amount of time.Instantaneously, the standout of Frozen its high-spirited soundtrack, right down to Idina Menzel's Oscar-winning song 'Let it Go.' In a world where so many animated films bear tired songs that are drab and more often than not forgettable, Frozen incorporates very memorable songs sung by its variety of characters, with my personal favorites being 'Do You Want to Build a Snowman?,' 'Love is an Open Door,' and 'Reindeers are Better than People.' On top of that, Frozen also includes a lively and highly-detailed visual scheme to match its premise, with what appear to be animated acres of pearly white snow decorating the trees and the ground, with the texture of ice and buildings looking consistently sublime. This is a rare Disney film that makes you invested in its world where some just keep you at arm's length as a passive observer. Frozen does what few films do and that's offer you to come play in the snow with everyone.If Disney has proved anything with Frozen and Wreck-It Ralph and Dreamworks with Despicable Me and How to Train Your Dragon it's that Pixar is not the only animation studio with the power to create a story that will appeal to children as well as adults. Pixar has been criticized recently for being in something of a slump since their recent string of animated films has not been as impressive as their streak had been for several years prior. If anything, these films from two enormous companies is a wakeup call to Pixar basically iterating the idea that they have rough and tumble competition, whether they'd like to admit it or not.On a final note, is there some disappointment I experienced with Frozen? Maybe a little bit; I'm growing incredibly weary of princess films for one and thought maybe this would've worked better as a story about two ordinary siblings rather than draping them in princess and attire, and I occasionally found Olaf to be an annoying, overly-quirky little side character. However, above all, I see Frozen being as cheerfully regarded by the new generation as The Lion King is for my generation.Voiced by: Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Jonathan Groff, Josh Gad, and Santino Fontana.

X-Men: The Last Stand," Maybe we needed this to show us how good we had it
","A facility by the name of Worthington Labs has announced that it will now look to suppress the X-gene, the gene that gives their special, superhuman abilities, and is trying to get as many mutants to forgo their special abilities as they can. Any fan of the X-Men knows this will upset the series' main villain Magneto (Ian McKellen), who works to establish a world where mutants have complete control over traditional humans. This leap in science, however, has concerned Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and his band of X-Men, and this is their cue to investigate. On the case are mainly the clawed anti-hero Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and the unpredictable Storm (Halle Berry), who work to, once again, stop Magneto and try to convince that humans and mutants can indeed coexist.X-Men: The Last Stand immediately turned heads for the sole purpose that, for the first time in the franchise's history, it was not directed by Bryan Singer, who didn't quite have a third film in mind. Singer left to direct Superman Returns, which was released the same year as The Last Stand. Instead, the studio hired director Brett Ratner, whom was one of the many in talks to direct the first X-Men. Ratner has publicly proclaimed his lack of knowledge when it came to the comic book series, but was optimistic that 20th Century Fox's writers - Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn - knew enough about what they were doing in order to make a successful and loyal adaptation.Learning of Ratner's ignorance of the series fuels one of the more lofty complaints I have about this third installment, and that is the project feels very insincere and lacking in the similar grace and charm of a comic book on screen. What Singer and the film's writers had built, up until then, was a film that existed in respect to the franchise it was blowing on the big screen, not simply to exist. With Ratner on board, and Singer's quips nowhere to be found, X-Men: The Last Stand feels like an advertisement for the series.For one, there is much more action in this particular film than in any other film in the franchise. After watching the gleefully kinetic and wonderfully stylized violence in X2: X-Men United, it's a shame we have now retraced our steps to incorporate tiresome, listless battles that go on for several minutes at a time, sometimes ten or maybe even fifteen minutes. Because of this, the effect of the series' enticing setpieces has dwindled from creative and something to anticipate to something that causes little else besides exhaustion. Things explode, characters fall, some of them die, most characters move out of the way just in the nick of time, and so forth.It's not that Ratner's direction and the camera work here is subpar, it's just there doesn't seem to be a method to Ratner's madness here in terms of excessive amounts of special effects and chaotic fight scenes. The nail in the coffin, however, is the writing, which is some of the most atrocious I've ever witnessed in a screenplay for a superhero film. Character development and connections are halted greatly when they were expanded throughout the first and second film, characters speak heavily in goofy puns and inexcusably poor jokes, and Wolverine is given speaking lines that leads one to believe the intent was to make him the most unbelievable character in the mix.What we have with X-Men: The Last Stand are undeniably good special effects, a further, if half baked, expansion on the idea of mutants and how the themes of this franchise potentially reflect society's discrimination of race, sex, and orientation, direction that clearly lacks the heart of what its predecessor managed to conjure up, and downright awful writing.While the first two X-Men films were definitely not two of the superhero films I cherished the most, they exercised their ideas and themes of discrimination and individuality to the fullest degree. With that, they took numerous heroes with the common attribute of being physically unique and possessing different powers and a wide range of talents and turned it into a complete two-part film. X-Men: The Last Stand shows what the series would've been like had its ideas been shortchanged and action would've taken prominence; perhaps it was a necessary miscalculation for us to see how lucky we had it for two films straight.Starring: Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, Anna Paquin, Patrick Stewart, and Ian McKellen, Kelsey Grammar, James Marsden, Rebecca Romijn, Shawn Ashmore, Aaron Stanford, and Vinnie Jones.

Hellboy," A hero who plays like a villain
","Hellboy features visual effects on all different scales, all of which can be described as nothing short of spectacular. I wasn't so much attracted to the story as I was by Ron Perlman's wonderful performance and the uncanny amount of effects that were flooding the screen at record speeds.If that's what you crave, than Hellboy is the recommended picture. Origins stories are hit or miss for me, but I found this particular one more believable in terms of performances and depth than Daredevil, yet not as polished and as moving as the recent Spider-Man films. But is it fair to compare Hellboy to the likes of a hero that is incredibly mainstream? That was for the masses. This is for the cultists.'Hellboy' came out after the Nazis erected a portal off the coast of Scotland in 1944, hopefully summoning beasts from different worlds to help them win the war. The Nazis are soon defeated, the portal destroyed, but not before a blood-red infant emerges. The allies who discover him coin the name 'Hellboy' for the little guy.I'm sure you now know where this will lead; Hellboy's main gift to the world is assisting in attacking paranormal creatures that are attempting to wreak havoc on our planet Earth. Super simple stuff. Director Guillermo del Toro's livens up the seemingly disposable material with a bright light show, equipped with impressive pyrotechnics and a helluva lot of explosions to boot. For someone that, surprisingly, wasn't very moved or gripped by the storytelling, the effects served as the main course I was happy to feast on.The key to Hellboy's success is Ron Perlman's amazingly gifted performance as the horned, red-skinned, quick-witted, loose-lipped, cigar-chomping demon that is Hellboy. Perlman's not only built for the role but incredibly capable in the shoes of the character, who possibly will never be portrayed as accurately again.The direction by del Toro bleeds style and packs in enough substance as well. The character of Hellboy is closely followed throughout the course and it seems that even though many things are going on, we never lose sight of what is happening. Hellboy is a truly favorable superhero film, with a hero who looks and behaves sometimes more like a villain.Starring: Ron Perlman, Selma Blair, Jeffrey Tambor, Karel Roden, Rupert Evans, and John Hurt. Directed by: Guillermo del Toro.",8,2,2,22 August 2012
Good Will Hunting," Liking these apples
","When people have a hidden talent, or can do something that very few other people can, they tend to show it off or even brag about it. Not the case in Good Will Hunting. Matt Damon plays Will Hunting, a closet-genius who works as a janitor at the prestigious College MIT. He spends his days mopping hallways, and solving complicated math problems outside on the chalkboard.Will spends most of his time with friends Chuckie (Affleck), Billy (Hauser), and Morgan (Casey Affleck), but once they all get in another fight on a basketball court, Professor Gerald Lambeau (Skarsgård) from MIT says that he must look into seeing a therapist and agree to study mathematics at MIT. Will agrees, and after a few failed therapists an aging man named Sean (Williams) is called in to help Will overcome his struggles.On the side note, Will meets a girl named Skylar (Driver) at a bar, and after a while they begin seeing each other. The problem is Will keeps pushing away at her, when really, he should be pulling closer.The script, written by actors Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, is outstanding and certain monologues are so well written and originally acted that they rank up there with some of the dialog scenes from a Kevin Smith film. Ironically, both Affleck and Damon appeared in Dogma two years later reciting the same amazing dialog, only this time, by Kevin Smith.Certain scenes where Sean is telling his life-story to Will are lengthy, but you never see the film lose your attention. Good Will Hunting is a rarity in story and in story-telling. And having two amazing youths write a script so advanced and so powerful just is the icing on the cake.If there's anything the film lacks is its scenes with Affleck and Damon. Both create amazing chemistry on screen, and when brought together show off creative dialog, intense arguments, and shocking realism. The final dialog scene between the boys takes place at a construction site, where both the boys work. Chuckie tells Will that it would be an insult to the other workers here if he was still here in twenty years. Chuckie can't understand why someone like Will wouldn't want to show off his smarts, and I think I kind of sympathize with Will on that note.When someone posses a talent in something they don't always want to show it. I know a number of people who are very good at a different variety of things, but none willing to show off their true potential. For me, I always want to show people what I can do, and am afraid of saying some things because I worry that they will get the wrong idea about me. I always want to show everyone my true abilities, and what makes up someone like me. But in Will's case, he doesn't want to do that for comfort purposes.Good Will Hunting is authentic and rare. It's a film where almost everything is powerful and everything is so well done. The theme of 'self-worth' is discussed in frequent films, but here, it is discussed stronger and with more heart than many films. It's a gem, shining stronger in places where others don't even show a glare.Starring: Matt Damon, Robin Williams, Ben Affleck, Minnie Driver, Stellan Skarsgård, Cole Hauser, and Casey Affleck.

Room," A tremendous mix of drama and science-fiction that will eventually resonate with nearly viewer at some point in time
","I remember seeing a trailer for 'Room' months back in 2015 and being almost entirely mystified; it looked like a strange, almost ethereal mix of drama and science-fiction that even the trailer couldn't adequately communicate. Not until seeing it, I realized that this is a film that isn't easy to summarize in a brief two minute trailer, and I'll undoubtedly struggle to illustrate the film's genius with its review. This is the kind of film one needs to experience and feel; a film where words often feel either exaggerating or shortchanging in attempting to illustrate the film's emotional power and exceptional narrative.Simply put, 'Room' is the emotional movie-going experience of the season. A deeply moving film that combines the aforementioned genres of drama and science-fiction, 'Room' is the kind of film that hits you with its most powerful shot after you walk out of the theater or turn off the TV. It lingers in your mind and the characters, their motivations, their conversations, their struggles, and their thoughts don't escape you, unlike most dramas, where character names are probably not even remembered by most following the end credits.The film opens with a young mother named Joy (Brie Larson) and her small child named Jack (Jacob Tremblay), who live their life in an enclosed garden shed of about one-hundred square feet and their only available sunlight is a skylight. They eat, sleep, bathe, and cook in there, and for Jack, it's the only life he has come to know. At first, their routine actions and close relationship lead one to believe that they've chosen this life in order to free themselves from the constraints of society. However, we see the horror of their reality soon enough.Seven years ago, Joy was tricked and kidnapped by a man known as 'Old Nick' (Sean Bridgers), who raped her and had her give birth to Jack. Since then, she has lived inside this closed space; it isn't until their escape-plan is successful that Joy goes back to her mother and father and Jack finally experiences the outside world. Previously, Jack believed, largely in part of his mother, who tried to make their life seem a lot less hellish, that outside of the four walls of 'room,' as they referred to it, was outer space. The people on TV were just flat, and nothing else besides them and Old Nick existed.Upon finally escaping and trying to return to a life that seems brand new to them, Joy struggles to get Jack to assimilate to the world. His entire life was predicated upon just him and his 'Ma,' as he was largely kept hidden in the closet whenever Old Nick would come pay them a visit. Now, he must be socialized into the world at age five, and learn that there is not only a larger life, but a larger world outside of 'room.' His mother, on the other hand, must grapple with her demons that have haunted her since she was captured.If you look at 'Room' from the perspective of Joy, you find a drama about being re-socialized into the world after living your entire life in captivity. It's a familiar story, but one that is truly sad and potent, and Brie Larson brings such life and emotion to the role for a woman so young (her precocious acting reminds me quite a bit of Jennifer Lawrence). However, if you look at the film through Jack's perspective, you see a film that plays with the realm of science-fiction. While nothing about 'Room' deals with supernatural or 'the unknown' in a grandiose sense, we do have a character who has never experienced life first-hand and sees everything around him not only as foreign but, for lack of a better term, alien.This results in a film that's very lucid and ethereal, largely in part because of Lenny Abrahamson's (who directed 2014's 'Frank,' a strong film dealing with mental illness) unique direction and cinematographer Danny Cohen's dreamlike grasp on reality. These beautiful and immersive aesthetic choices make the world and everything we take for granted and overlook on a daily basis look as if it's an unearthly object, with extreme close-ups and high-contrast depictions employed by Abrahamson.'Room' is a film largely bent on repetition; everything from Joy and Jack's daily actions in 'room,' Jack's attempts to socialize with other adults, Joy's attempt to come to terms with returning to her old life, and more are all showcased as recurring events in the film. This slowburn narrative tactic allows character motivations and interest to rise and boil accordingly, creating a film that turns impacting and even emotional when bigger, more elaborate events occur (the truck scene may be one of the best sequences I've seen in film last year). With all that and more considered, 'Room' is a wonderful treat of a film; one that will hit everyone differently in a sense that it's not a matter of if it will resonate with you but how it will eventually manage to do so.",10,1,7,25 January 2016
Schindler's List," A strong standout worthy of its placement on the top one hundred films ever made
","For a movie as monumental as Schindler's List, I believe a review should be conducted in a different style. Normally, my reviews consist of multiple paragraphs, summarizing the plot and my thoughts on the film. This time I want to give five reasons why Schindler's List was easily one of the most powerful and breathtaking motion pictures I've ever seen. It goes above and beyond anyone's expectation, and cements itself on the list of greatest films of all time. Here's why.1. Acting. No one could write about Schindler's List and not talk about Liam Neeson's Oscar worthy performance as Oskar Schindler, the business man from Czechoslovakia. He plays it with power and full force, grade A acting. Still shocked his leading performance didn't win him the Oscar in 1994.2. Storyline. Instead of focusing on one of the survivors, or a fictional story for that matter, Spielberg chooses to focus on Oskar Schindler, a rather unsung chapter and character of The Holocaust. Oskar Schindler worked for the Nazis, and is famous for using his great wealth to buy hundreds of Jews to make them work in his factory. It wasn't much, but it prevented death, and they would make bowls for the Nazis. Even though the film goes into a subject, some may not know, the storyline is definitely one of the strongest points.3. The end sequence. I don't want to ruin the final scenes in the film, but let's just say, it's one of the most effective and well done scenes in film history.4. The film's desire to 'show it all.' When Holocaust movies are made, so try to water the film down by not showing the terrible treatment of innocent Jews. This one doesn't. Despite the event being gruesome, tasteless, and ignorant, no movie should subject itself to water down the scenes. Unless it's PG-13, and I doubt many Holocaust movies are. Schindler's List isn't all about the gas chambers and things most of us already know. We witness two of the worst things possible; (1) innocent people taken out to the yard and being shot in the head with absolutely no feeling on the guard's part and (2) we see the heart-wrenching scenes of peoples belonging getting tossed off balconies like garbage. That part I almost couldn't bear to watch.5. The complete carelessness for human life. Face it, the Jews and many other races were dehumanized come time of The Holocaust. Life didn't matter to anybody. You could tell a Nazi officer that you just killed sixty thousand Jews in one day and they wouldn't flinch, yell, smile, or object. They would say 'Good work.' They wouldn't take into consideration you just killed sixty thousand mothers, father, brothers, sisters, grandparents, aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces, and worst of all, children of both sexes. One scene in the film, right before a woman is shot in the head, the camera zooms in on her to show her frightened reactions, her pale face, and her clearly nervous behavior. Spielberg most likely did that to remind viewers that the victims in this movie were people and they were innocent people with their own feelings in life. Dehumanization lived in The Holocaust.Schindler's List currently ranks number nine on the American Film Institute's (AFI) list of one hundred greatest American films ever made. I am a firm believer that if this wasn't in Spielberg's hands, it wouldn't touch that list. Thankfully, we get one down to Earth and very vibrant Holocaust movies that manages to accomplish what it should. Just an all around amazing film.Starring: Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, Ralph Fiennes, Caroline Goodall, Jonathan Sagall, and Embeth Davidtz. Directed by: Steven Spielberg.",10,9,14,4 June 2011
The Mist," Consuming like the fog itself
","This is my first viewing of Frank Darabont's The Mist in about five years and the first time I have watched it in black and white. If there's anyway to watch the film, it's to sit down, deep in the night, and watch it completely drained of color. Seeing it in theaters, the idea was creepy, but adding black and white to it makes it an entirely different experience. The film opens with a three minute introduction with Darabont himself explaining how he has had people say that it would be 'cool' if The Mist could be made in a colorless fashion, to replicate and pay subtle homage to the classic Universal monster films that inspired it. As anyone would believe, marketing a black and white horror film, in a day and age where special effects and bright, vivid colorization is the norm, the idea would flounder with audiences, likely wouldn't resonate too well, and probably wind up doing middling numbers. Just before the film begins, Darabont states that this is the version he recommends you see. The colored version helps illustrate the ideas and events in a more compelling and plausible way, where as the black and white version seems to be more concerned with atmosphere and implausibility. It knows it's a campy, downright outrageous monster flick, but in the mean-time, it almost feels like we're watching two different films; one concerned with realism and monsters and the other concerned with intelligence and depth.Seeing both, I believe I could write two separate and very different reviews on each, but I refuse. I can sum up my ideas coherently into one. Stephen King's novel 'The Mist' remains my favorite by him for its simplicity, its depth, and its exploration of characters pushed to the limit. It's a 'what would you do?' kind of picture that is equal parts claustrophobic horror and psychological thriller.The film is centered around David Drayton (Jane), a movie poster painter with a wife and young child named Billy (Gamble). After a wild, rambunctious storm blows through their town in the Stephen King locale of Maine, David is forced to confront his neighbor Brent (Braugher) whom he's had a contentious relationship with over the years. The three of them head out to the grocery store, hoping to pick up some food and supplies since they are in the mix of a power outage. Their shopping trip is unexpectedly interrupted when a man runs in screaming with blood running down his face that something is in the mist that is currently blowing in. The scene where the mist flows quietly into the area, before consuming the supermarket in its entirety is masterful, sort of noir-istic in its black and white form, yet far too short. A trip to the storage room, the workers and David discover that something really is in the mist. Something with six large tentacles, among a wide variety of other undefinable beasts that seem to be composed of parts taken from other familiar insects. Whatever the hell they are, they are creepy, mysterious, yet intriguing and limitless.The remainder of the film takes place in the store, as the townspeople try to comprehend the fact that unrecognized beings are preying on them from the outside and the fact that they are trapped in a store full of people they don't truly know. One of the most annoying characters is Marcia Gay Harden's Mrs. Carmody, the ultra-religious, god-fearing fanatic who preaches how 'we the people' asked for this with our constant disrespect for God and his teachings. While I hated her character back then, and in black and white she's still a distasteful witch, Harden plays her in an undeniably brilliant fashion. It isn't easy to bring so much passion and soul to a character so unlikable, but it works because of the gifted material and script given to her. Thomas Jane, a rather under-used actor, plays his role as the main protagonist well, and handles the stressful situation with realism and integrity. One character that seems to get the unfortunate cold shoulder is Toby Jones' Ollie, as one of the store's employees. Sometimes, when he is on screen, he invites a strongly ominous presents almost as gripping as the thick fog outside.What Darabont knows how to do is to trap his characters not only geographically, but mentally, and always bring up the ideas of hope and fear by structuring substantial teams with the characters. I was constantly reminded of how The Shawshank Redemption (almost every director has their own masterpiece and that is Darabont's) portrayed the drastically different characters and their unique views on life and how they handled being confined to four walls and cynicism. There were teams in the prison, and there are teams in The Mist. The civilians turned radicals, as well as the collective group of people who just want to try and remain civil and try to keep everyone else in a state of calmness. Unfortunately, that rarely works out, especially during a riveting third act.The ending, I must say, whether seen in color or black and white is one of the saddest in any horror film in the last decade. One would think the absence of color would drown the value of emotions, but frankly, it could be argued that it intensifies them by making them seem bleaker, more abstract, and even more joyless. I'd like to hear what color Darabont believes has greater effect on the ending.The Mist is a strong piece of film, frightening to comprehend, sometimes maddeningly explicit in its monologues, and incorruptibly entertaining throughout. If there's one thing we should've learned by now, it's that Maine is not a safe state to inhabit.Starring: Thomas Jane, Nathan Gamble, Marcia Gay Harden, Laurie Holden, Andre Braugher, Toby Jones, and Melissa McBride.

Dog Day Afternoon," The SNL of films about bank robberies
","The prime goal of a bank robber, besides immediate financial gain, is efficiency, and this is for a number of reasons. Nobody wants to hear the story about a successful bank robber for the very virtue that he was successful and, on that particular day, evil won. The immortalized stories and the ones that get repeated through generations, or, in this case, get movies made about them, are those that were peculiar or not-so successful. An inefficient bank robber has more of a probability of their identity being discovered, their alibi in case of indictment being compromised, or their ultimate goal of getting the money and running being corrupted by the police, who's prime goal is also efficiency. The issue is that robbing a bank can go a number of different ways and nobody really knows what will happen until it is happening.These reasons and more are why the story of John Wojtowicz is so intriguing. Based on the true story - a story so absurd that it must be reiterated time and time again that it is indeed rooted in fact - of a bank robbery taking place in Brooklyn back in 1972, Dog Day Afternoon follows three men, Sonny Wortzik (Al Pacino), his friend Sal Naturale (John Cazale), and another accomplice named Stevie (Gary Springer). The three men attempt to rob the First Brooklyn Savings Bank one morning, and the plan goes awry almost immediately when Stevie loses his cool and abandons the two men after Sal first draws his gun. In another unfortunate circumstance, Sonny and Sal realize they've chosen to rob the bank right after the daily cash pickup truck has arrived, meaning the bank only has around $1,000 in the vault.Sonny attempts to make up for this circumstance by stealing the bank's traveler's checks and burning the bank's ledger that keeps track of all of them. The smoke from the small blaze alerts nearby businesses and law-enforcement of suspicious activities, and what was supposed to be a routine, by-the-numbers robbery becomes a hostage situation and a media spectacle. The incompetent and defeated Sonny winds up attempting to hold the young, female bank tellers hostage, as well as maintain his cool long enough to request enough supplies and transportation to get him and Sal to safety as quickly as possible.The problem is that, throughout the course of Dog Day Afternoon, nothing happens as quickly or as conveniently for the characters as possible. The result is like watching a pathetic bank robbery put on by a band of Saturday Night Live cast members, as both Sonny and Sal are stuck between a rock and a hard place throughout the entire film. This also makes this particular film so interesting because of its constant situational humor that seems to keep building and developing as the film goes along. Nothing goes right for the characters, despite their efforts to make things work, and that's one of the fundamental building blocks of comedy that director Sidney Lumet and screenwriter Frank Pierson constantly toy with.By classification and its inherent nature, Dog Day Afternoon is a crime drama. It centers around a bank robbery and, regardless of how ill-conceived and managed such the bank robbery is, its narrative is ultimately fixated on a crime. Having said that, it's worth noting how seamlessly Lumet and Pierson interweave comedy and dry wit into the film's narrative, not turning the contents of the story into a laugh riot desperate for uproarious reactions from the audience, but allowing the pathetic characters and the poor circumstance to work for themselves and create comedy very naturally. It's only right that Al Pacino, an actor who can play both low-key and over-the-top, often in the same film, lead the cast as a character who, throughout the course of the film, looks like the personification of an unattended pot left to hopelessly boil over on the stove with nobody in sight to save or cool it down.Dog Day Afternoon's sole setting and slight number of characters allows for familiarity in faces and locations to build very elegantly. Neither Lumet nor Pierson get too caught up in the spectacle of the entire event and shift the focus away from the interior meltdown to the commotion occurring outside. I'd actually be hardpressed to believe, at least after seeing this, that a short film centered around a successful bank robbery captured in one setting would be as tense as this. The unpredictability and the sheer lunacy of all that is unfolding really assist the film in creating something so crazy without gratuitous shock value that it's truly something to behold for all of its one-hundred and twenty minutes.Starring: Al Pacino, John Cazale, Gary Springer.

School of Rock," Cut footloose and attend The School of Rock
","Just when you think kids movies hit an all time low along comes a film that shows that effort and life can still be injected into them. School of Rock was Jack Black's rebound after a string of critical failures like Orange County and Saving Silverman. He proves that, like Chris Farley in Tommy Boy, he can play the lovable louse in a clean yet fun manner appealing to many different audiences.Though it's a kids movies, I can see adults enjoying it more. At least understanding it more. It focuses a lot on the history of rock and many bands rock icons such as AC/DC, Black Sabbath, and Led Zepplin that I'm not sure many kid would instantaneously recognize. But it has enough slapstick humor, colors, and off the wall humor for them to still be interested or at least amused in the storyline.The story follows Dewey Finn (Black) a layabout who has been mooching off his roommate Ned Schneebly (White) for rent money. After Ned's girlfriend gets fed up with his behavior, they both force Dewey to get a job and pay them by the end of the week. Since Ned is a substitute teacher, Dewey gets a call one day from prestigious elementary school in Woodbury, New York asking for Ned to fill in for a week or so. Dewey pretends to be Ned so he can fill in for the position and collect the check.At first, he goes down the lackadaisical route and just lets the children do whatever they want. Soon, he discovers that they are very tightly wound, but can play instruments very well, each with their own talent. It then becomes clear that Dewey must teach these kids how to overcome their drone-like lifestyles and, well, rock out.Avoiding clichés, Dewey doesn't just take one student under his wing to befriend them, he takes them all, each giving them an equal amount of screen time. It has almost become a law that when a movie has a teacher for the main character, he/she must take them under their wing and guide them through their troubles. Here, Dewey assists each one. All the kids are stuck in the same boat of being put under a very large amount of pressure, but everyone has their own hidden talent they can't show. That's why they need Dewey.Jack Black is a charismatic joy in the film. He's crazy, yet lovable in a way that is hard to accomplish. He sometimes goes overboard, but he quickly stops himself to regain his previous behaviors. It's a little hard to identify what makes him so likable. I think it's because so many characters on Television and in movies try too hard to be liked, and out of the blue we get this character who is inspiring, hip, exciting, unpredictable, and funny.I was reminded of the 80's hit Footloose more than once during this film. That was a film I think I saw in the wrong time period, thus cementing my dislike for its messy execution. It simply tried to be too many things and didn't do a very good job at any of them. School of Rock has the same sort of message, but both films have seriously different plots. Footloose centers around a town on the verge of banning music, but teenagers across the town say it's one of the many forms of 'cutting loose' in the world. School of Rock is about a genial sack who pretends to be a teacher to get a job at a school so he can obtain money, but then it becomes clear he wants to teach the tightly-wound runts to 'cut loose' as well. Both films are about being yourself, individuality, and sticking it to 'the man,' but School of Rock does it in a more fun and controlled manner.It had been solely for the music and the message I would've recommended it, but the fact that it features a great cast of kids and a strong and sentimental lead actor seals the deal of this not only being a great movie but a proof that fun kids films still exist. School of Rock is a big-hearted, energetic, joyous exercise in the field of comedy proving that it can appeal to those who pay for the ticket and those who go along for ride.The MPAA can also thank themselves for giving a perfect film for ages seven and up a PG-13 rating.Starring: Jack Black, Joan Cusack, Mike White, Miranda Cosgrove, Sarah Silverman, and Adam Pascal.

Cars 2," Just needs a minor tune-up
","I was really hoping that Cars 2 would score big like the first movie. The first movie is my favorite Pixar film, which maybe strange to some. It took in the lowest box office revenue out of all the films, and it is rated only a 74% on Rotten Tomatoes. Cars is true beauty in every category. Amazing colors, very heartfelt story, fifties nostalgia, amazing characters, and a soundtrack to die for.Even though considered a failure in Pixar's eyes, Cars still took in over $8 billion in merchandise. Being young when the first movie came out, I went to Target and bought all of the main characters from the first movie. The little side characters or the parody Toy Story characters weren't for me. I bought the main/supporting characters like McQueen, Mater, Ramone, Flo, Guido, Luigi, Sally, Fillmore, Sarge, etc. It was so much fun to get those little cars. You gotta collect them all! They had numerous race tracks which I didn't want, pillows, t-shirts, posters, and other merchandising options that two full isles at Target were Cars-out'd the whole summer of 2006. Because cars can be made into so many different things. Race tracks, different designs, colors, sizes, etc can be made from one outline. Lightening McQueen had at least eight other versions of himself. Mater had two if I can remember if you include the very light blue painting of him and his traditional, rusty colored truck. It was inane how many options there were.Now we have a sequel, to a film John Lasseter probably wanted to make since the death of his friend Joe Ranft, who helped co-direct the first film and voiced Red, the shy firetruck as well. His character makes an appearance, but remains sadly silent the whole film not uttering a single line or phrase. It's almost upsetting when you see his character.Lasseter made the Toy Story sequels because they were huge money-makers and more could be done with them. I hate to say it, but I think the original Cars could've survived on its own. This is in no way bad, but it is just average to Pixar's standards. Much of the fun from the original film isn't here. The tear-jerking Your Town tune is absent, the campy Radiator Springs fun is gone, the flashbacks to the fifties where towns were made up of close friends are all gone, and the nostalgia, besides the characters, none is here.Cars 2 doesn't fail entirely, though. Pixar manages to have some fun with the script and have very colorful moments about it. The end chase scene is very exciting, and I love how all the characters make it out without even a scratch. That part still impresses me. Try doing that with Grandpa's ol' 1972 Cadillac Eldorado.The plot focuses on Lightening McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) returning 'home' to Radiator Springs every summer after the racing season to visit his friends. Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) is still his tow-truck self, now working at a fancy car-themed restaurant where McQueen and his girlfriend Sally (Hunt) go to eat on McQueen's first night. Mater, who is watching TV while waiting for drinks to be served, notices that the 'sexy,' Italian race-car Francesco Bernoulli (Turturro) is trash-talking McQueen. Mater, being the affectionate car he is, puts the motor where Bernoulli's mouth is and signs McQueen up to race against him in the Grand Prix.Mater then becomes involved in a very elaborate plan conducted by Finn McMissile (Caine), a secret agent race-car. I'd rather not spoil any details because I feel reading about the colorful excitement isn't half as fun as experiencing it on the big screen.Another problem I ran into that some characters didn't make an appearance, or weren't in it enough. Luigi and Guido, the two repairman of Radiator Springs, were hilarious in the first film but are in it far too little. Ramone and Flo, the husband and wife who run a body shop and diner, are barely in the film. Doc Hudson, voiced by the late Paul Newman, is dead according to Mater. And Fillmore's voice once provided by George Carlin is now voiced by Lloyd Sherr who does a just a stereotypical 'hey, man' and 'spread the love' motif the whole film.The lights are extravagant in Cars 2, especially in Tokyo. The billboards are beautiful and the scenery is truly amazing. CGI animated features are good if used to their full potential. Glossy productions don't always win people over. For me, it needs a good storyline. Cars 2 has a fairly decent one, but not one that sustains a film.The Toy Story themed short Hawaiian Vacation is actually very enticing and humorous, as all shorts from them are. I believe, this is the first Pixar short to utilize already familiar characters. Cars 2 doesn't fail at all, but it succeeds just because of its animation and well paced action. After eleven films and twenty five years of movie-making, Pixar has come to a sudden bump in the road. I'm sure this is just a minor fix, and they should be up and runnin' in a jiffy, but one can pray it doesn't go down the direction of Dreamworks or present day Disney. We may have to ship it to the junkyard.Voiced by: Owen Wilson, Larry the Cable Guy, Michael Caine, Emily Mortimer, Bonnie Hunt, Jason Isaacs, and Thomas Kretschmann. Directed by: John Lasster and Brian Lewis.",8,1,4,27 June 2011
The Game," Ridin' the game out
","Michael Douglas is Nicholas Van Orton, a wealthy investment banker, living a somber, lonesome life in a luxurious mansion that is only inhabited by himself after his divorce. He has become miserable and decidedly unfulfilled lately, but begins to walk down a path of, well, let's say excitement when, on his forty-eight birthday, his brother Conrad (Sean Penn) informs him about a group called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). CRS specializes in something called 'the game,' which Conrad leaves highly ambiguous, only providing the vague details that Nicholas must try it and leaving him with the encompassing notion that it will change his life.After delaying his visit to the company, to apply for 'the game,' he undergoes a series of exhausting and lengthy psychological and physical examinations to, allegedly, show his fitness for the exercise. Later that week, he is told his application is rejected, oblivious to the fact that 'the game' itself has already begun. He discovers this one night when his TV begins talking directly to him, informing him about a series of keys that will come in handy at one point or another. What unfolds is a virtual video game, so to speak, with Nicholas himself, and the viewers of the film, questioning what is real and what is fictitious.Films like David Fincher's The Game provide us with a unique, viable luxury, which is knowing about as much, or sometimes less, as the main character. In this case, we spend most of the film as confused as Nicholas, lost and wandering in the limitless, sometimes unknowable forces of reality. Writing about The Game, or even talking about The Game to someone who hasn't seen it, just doesn't work in retrospect. The aesthetics and plot developments can only be described so thoroughly before they channel lunacy and incomprehensible nonsense. Even seeing the film seems to have the same effect. This is truly a work that exercises in the unexplainable field of cinema and does it great justice.Coming off of Fincher's acclaimed film Se7en, which has gone criminally unseen by me, to follow up with a film like The Game would logically generate mixed reception. The tone it holds is dark and heavy, accompanied by imagery and visuals that are bleak and replicate the look of film noir, and the story is non-linear and possesses a fondness to trick viewers and critics of it. This is a film that likes to play with your emotions and toy with your head as you watch it. Depending on how much of that you can stomach (for me, a film can only do so much of that before I stop caring and see through its roots of being a convoluted mish-mash of storytelling devices), this may be satisfying and wholly substantial. It does what a film of its magnitude should do and that is provide its story and approach with equal opportunities of commentary and explanation. I think I've got one.'The Game' in itself is something that is used for those who want to add energy, excitement, and thrill to their lives. It's a device created for those who have yet to 'live' or enjoy life on its own terms. It exists to show its players a good time, and even when they're struggling or beyond scared, it is still the most fun and excitement they've had in years.Take the above explanation in any way you see fit, and add it to as it doesn't even seem to cover the entire span of open-endedness this film has in store. While The Game lacks in emotional character involvement and, towards the end, becomes rather redundant and plodding, it succeeds in developing a frightening and eerie utopia that, while giving its participants satisfaction and adventure, provides them with a scarring, indelible mark. Take that however you want as well.Starring: Michael Douglas, Sean Penn, and Deborah Kara Unger. Directed by: David Fincher.",8,1,1,11 May 2013
Ghostbusters," The thirtieth anniversary re-release
","Much to my dismay and disappointment, I am usually never able to catch films that are re-released into theaters on account of an anniversary or a 3D upgrade. This is mainly because so many films often come out the same weekend as the re-releases to, leaving me strapped to make the decision to rewatch an old favorite in theaters or seek out and review the new releases, the ones people want to read reviews of. As somebody who watches anywhere from forty to sixty films a month, I need to choose wisely, and never, until now, have I chosen a re-released film over a new release.This all changed when an unsurprisingly slow film weekend in August revealed the thirtieth anniversary release of the 1984 classic fantasy-comedy 'Ghostbusters' in about seven-hundred theaters in the United States. In a time where some of the strangest, most unremarkable releases come out of the woodwork in American cinema, 'Ghostbusters' seemed like a perfect break from the drudgery of blockbusters, under-impressive sequels, under-performing risks, and so forth. Even as I sat back to watch one of the funniest and most original comedies of the 1980's on the big screen, I felt like I was taking a mini-vacation from this gig I call my side-job/passion.I doubt 'Ghostbusters' needs more than a brief plot summation, but the film concerns Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis), three misfits interested in the idea of supernatural forces and paranormal activity. The three men find themselves caught up in a whirlwind of popularity after being called to The New York Public Library to take down a ghost that has been haunting the library for sometime now, and following their success at identifying and capturing the being, the three decide to open up their own business as professional Ghostbusters, working with the city of New York to stop paranormal forces dead in their tracks. They are soon approached by Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson), to function as their fourth member, and attach themselves to Dana Barrett's (Sigourney Weaver) specific case, which concerns her apartment complex being overtaken by the demonic spirit known as Zuul, who's spirits are worshiped by Gozer the Gozerian, the God of Destruction.At first thought, the film sounds overstuffed and complicated, but as anyone familiar with the film knows, it's anything but. This is mainly because it would appear writers Aykroyd and Ramis bear the similar attitude about the entire project as the character Peter Venkman, sarcastic, lax, and carefree. This sounds like a criticism, but the fact that 'Ghostbusters' bears such a collective and relaxed aura about its story and its characters never makes the film fall prey to any confusing subplots or technological jargon. It can be sarcastic, it can be smug, and it can be just plain silly, but all of the above reasons, and the fact that the idea is executed to the fullest extent, are the reasons this film is so loved and cherished, albeit worthy of a thirtieth anniversary re-release.Being that there's little to critique, as most comments have already been made and mine will sound very much like a reiteration of old reviews, one must comment on the joy of seeing a re-released film on the big screen. For starters, 'Ghostbusters' has a great deal of elements that make it worthy of a big screen viewing. From the montage of catching ghosts, to the actual, developed scenes where catching Slimer is the gang's main objective, to witnessing the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man come to life on screen all compliment the inherent largeness of a theater screen wonderfully. Combine all of those elements with the terrific sound editing and elaborate special effects, which still look pretty good thirty years later, and there is an arguable reason to make a trip to the theater to see 'Ghostbusters.' Then there's Ray Parker, Jr.'s infectious theme song, which brings a smile to a nostalgic face, especially when heard through the expensive, surround-sound speakers of a theater. It's this song that is the bow to the entire experience of seeing 'Ghostbusters' alive on screen again. If the joy of seeing Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis, and Hudson interact and exchange the same classic, witty banter we can all quote flawlessly isn't enough for you, Ray Parker, Jr.'s theme song will surely place the icing on the timeless cake.Being that this is a different review than usual, I'll end the review not necessarily recommending the movie (you should know by now if you are or are not a fan of 'Ghostbusters') but recommending the experience to anyone who has yet to witness the phenomenon on a theater screen. The entire experience could make a wonderful introduction to classic, eighties films for the new generation, and for once feels like a genuine appreciation of the classic film without unnecessary upgrades in the third-dimension.Starring: Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver, and Rick Moranis.

Coyote Ugly," When you don't know what to say, display for TnA, I guess
","The most clever scene in Coyote Ugly is when Maria Bello explains why the bar is named what it is. She says it's when a woman wakes up in bed with a man after a one night stand and he's so ugly, but you have your arm around him because last night he seemed hot. Desperate, but not wanting to be rude, instead of pulling your arm out from under him you try to chew it off like a trapped coyote. That my friends, is Coyote Ugly.It was much to my surprise that Kevin Smith actually did a rewrite of the film's script at one point. I would imagine if Smith's version was made into the final film that it would be less about the girl's bodies and more about their problems. Instead of so many overhead shots of women dancing on one another, soaked in water, comparing wet t-shirts, I'm sure there would've been more sincere dialog between Violet and her friends. Maybe we would've gotten to know them better. It's all one big 'maybe.' The film centers around Violet (Perabo), an aspiring songwriter trying to make it in the complicated and relentless world of music. She tries to get her demo tape heard, but is always met with reps that blow her off. Violet leaves home and goes to New York to try her look, but realizing she needs to make end's meet, she goes to work at a bar called 'Coyote Ugly' where she will entertain customers by seductively dancing on the bar countertop while pouring drinks and showering her and her fellow employees with water. That's the extent of it.In the meantime, Violet dates a shady guy who she had mistaken for a record exec (Garcia). Let me ask Violet, do you think it's a good idea to date a guy who just tried to pass himself off as a guy who could get you a record deal and doesn't discuss any of his past? Does he seem like the dream guy mothers would want their daughters to date, and could have a good ol' day out with the father? I neglected to mention that the club is run by Lil (Bello). Lil, full name Liliana Lovell, actually runs the real-life Coyote Ugly in New York. Maria Bello was excellent in The Cooler, and does more sure-fire work in this picture. She is still as hilarious as ever, and plays a very strict, yet laidback bartender.Coyote Ugly, even in possession of a decent storyline, is ruined by its own immaturity. There are too many overhead shots of women on the bar countertop that go nowhere and aren't arousing or entertaining at all. I appreciate John Goodman's role as Violet's protective and caring dad, but the scenes with him are far to spread out and far too short to fully enjoy. I imagine if Kevin Smith was responsible for writing the entire screenplay maybe the movie would've been more about the daddy/daughter relationship rather than the women.The story isn't gripping, but it works for a while. Until the bar comes into play. Then it's down to twelve year olds controlling the camera. Piper Perabo is gorgeous, and is one of the most underrated actresses in Hollywood today in terms of looks and acting skills. She still hasn't had that 'breakout' role that has taken her career to new heights. Surprisingly, as juvenile as this picture can be, this really didn't jump-start any future projects for her. Nor anyone else in this film.Starring: Piper Perabo, Adam Garcia, Maria Bello, and John Goodman. Directed by: David McNally.",5,2,3,28 June 2011
The Hurt Locker," The tension is not knife worthy
","The Hurt Locker has been hailed as one of the best war films of all time, and while that may be a kind remark stretched out too far, it is easily one to commend and one of the best dramatizations of the Iraq War yet. Its high point is its suspense, conveyed in a terrifyingly realistic state. Its characters are also given close attention to, making the experience such a versatile one, that sometimes, it is too good to be true.Our main protagonist is Sgt. William James (Renner), a new-coming member of the US Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) in Iraq circa 2004. He is quickly, yet somewhat hastily greeted by Sergeant J.T. Sanborn (Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Geraghty), informing them that he is not there to replace their recently fallen man but to simply get the job done. Right off the bat, he is deeper than the average cookie-cutter action hero, more charismatic, more charming, and bolder, always landing with a loud bang. Renner is a beautiful addition to a film already soaring with anticipation.The film follows the three's adventures defusing bombs, hanging out, exchanging conversations, some of them sounding like they could be final ones, and many capturing poignancy without even remote hesitation. Director Kathryn Bigelow, ex-wife of James Cameron, director of Avatar, who she beat out for both Best Picture and Director, has a unique philosophy on filmmaking. When asked about her specialty in film in an interview, she replied 'I really think it's to explore and push the medium. It's not about breaking gender roles or genre traditions.' I agree with her very much so, although it is a bit numbing when we see a film break so bravely from redundant plot points and genre expectations. Bigelow is more concerned with pushing the envelope, rather than opening a new one. Sometimes, it's best to go further, instead of breathlessly trying to create something so different it becomes a convoluted and restless experience.The Hurt Locker wins with its suspense. Many scenes are captured with such a sure-fire realism to how brutal, unpredictable, and nerve-racking combat is. Then again, how would I know? I've never been drafted or even stepped on land full of decrepit buildings and an endless landscape of sand. I can't fully comment on the film's accuracy or even compare it to the true atmosphere of Iraq or any other war, but I will say that this is on par with my assumption of life on the battlefield.There is one minor quandary I can pick with the film, and it is its refusal to go further in its commentary on war. I've always wondered what happens when a soldier gets assigned a mission or a task that he does not feel is morally or ethically correct in his eyes. Of course, refusal of order could get you kicked out for good or even scolded mercilessly (again, so I've heard), but what happens when you're assigned a job you almost can't bring yourself to do? Also, it sometimes seems that Eldrige, James, and Samborn have no opinion on the war they are fighting. How does it feel to be manipulated by the government and almost robbed of individualism? As soon as you place the uniform on, you are one of the crowd. The Hurt Locker at least recognizes the beauty of individualism, even though you occupy a sort of ordinary quality.The Hurt Locker is beautifully filmed, even with its unstill videography, which I've grown so accustomed to, sometimes seeing a cinematically directed picture feels unnatural. Everything is captured so acutely and professionally, that we are not confused, but delightfully informed on what is where and who is who. The cinematography, by Mark Boal respectively, always provides us with the most unsettling array of shots, quaintly edited together to provide nice coherency, and the acting and presentation is all beautiful and immersing. Just when you think the film has run out of steam, it quickly picks up, mostly during its final scenes, which capture emotions and realism in a stunningly abnormal way. Despite all those remarkable qualities, this is almost not a film to enjoy, but a film to witness.Starring: Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, and Brian Geraghty. Director: Kathryn Bigelow.",9,0,3,29 May 2012
Ex Machina," Too thoughtful to adhere to the ordinary, American principles of science-fiction
","'Ex Machina' is powerful because of how low-key and meditative it is. It's the first science-fiction film in recent memory that doesn't do one of the following things: ask impossibly big questions, deliver amazing visuals but skimp out on character development and the exploration of such visuals, or decorate itself in glamor whilst ignoring its proposed, fundamental ideas. This is a science-fiction film that I found myself being able to follow as a story and not as a collection of larger-than-life ideas that you're really supposed to go along with and never precisely grasp or pinpoint (also known as 'Interstellar').The story revolves around Caleb Smith (Domhnall Gleeson), a young computer programmer for a search engine company known as Bluebook, who receives an invitation from the company's CEO, Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac), to visit him in his secluded estate in the mountains. Upon arrival by helicopter, Caleb takes note of how immense and intoxicating Nathan's home is, surrounded by lush landscapes, waterfalls, and elaborate forestry that all hides an enormous research facility inside of it.Here, Nathan tells Caleb he's partaking in a Turing test on an artificially intelligent humanoid named 'Ava' (Alicia Vikander). Ava is incredibly advanced, looking like the offspring of a human and a robot, with lifelike skin covering some of her body (enough to form a basic human face) and other parts of her (particularly her abdomen and arms) still showing her intricate wiring and robotic composure. Caleb and Ava spend a lot of time conversing, so Caleb can get the feel for how advanced Ava is. She's so advanced, she operates like a human lie detector at times and a deeply compassionate soul at others. Ava eventually warns Caleb of Nathan's deception, which Caleb comes to see for himself through Nathan's heavy drinking, cloudy motives, and vague planning methods for the future.The film is always commanded by three of the same actors for much of its runtime. Gleeson plays lost but not clueless very well here, never becoming the kind of character we lose interest in due to his incompetence nor alienated by because of his intellect. His Caleb character is ordinary, and Nathan recognizes it, with Gleeson assuming the traits quite nicely. Then there's Vikander, who is so close to being shortchanged in and of herself here, but thanks to writer/director Alex Garland, whenever she's on-screen, her Ava character is given a purpose. Whether that purpose is to show how advanced she is for someone who is artificially intelligent or for her to exhibit human traits of self-awareness, empathy, and compassion is entirely up to Garland, and he doesn't skimp on allowing Ava to be a character. Vikander handles the simple and simultaneous complex role very well.Finally, there's Oscar Isaac, who has hit a trifecta of fabulous, even Oscar-worthy performances. In three films, he has played depressed ('Inside Llewyn Davis'), conflicted ('A Most Violent Year'), and now, standoffish and brash in ways that turn such overused traits into breathing characters. Isaac's take on a scientist as someone more along the lines of that cocky soul at a party who believes he knows all by employing the Socratic Method or talking around his points is a brilliantly subversive tactic. Isaac delivers the character in a way that, much like Gleeson, has the ability to be offputting but, instead, is riveting.Finally, there's more to 'Ex Machina' than artificial intelligence, which, as I began to realize following the credits, wasn't what the film seems to really be about. The film illustrates an idea of female empowerment in a boldly subtle way. It shows how a woman, who has been caged and manipulated her entire life, at one time solely by a manipulative egotist, and now, by a 'white knight' or nice guy, for lack of a better term, struggles to find an identity and loses her opportunity to explore the outside (or, to her, the unknown). Science-fiction is known to dabble into themes exploring our world and the problems we face, but even with that known fact, it's surprising for a film like this, that already operates on a middling-budget in comparison to other science-fiction pieces, to explore ideas of women in patriarchal societies. Such concepts only seem too real and close-to-home for our world, but 'Ex Machina,' again, isn't the traditional, American science-fiction film.This film is a different breed of science-fiction that may allude the usual science-fiction moviegoers who gravitate towards sound and light shows or constant, existentialist ideas. It's far too thoughtful to get caught up in those surface concepts. Through beautiful cinematography, accentuating mood through its use of lighting and haunting music, exquisite acting on all fronts, and a probable idea to tie it together, it succeeds on being a terrific piece of entertainment and commentary. The same feeling people had about director Neill Blomkamp following his directorial debut 'District 9,' I think I now have about Garland.",9,8,17,26 April 2015
Grudge Match," A major-minor movie with some good majors but sometimes distracting minors
","When word first circulated that Robert De Niro and Sylvester Stallone, two acting legends, were signing on to do a film about two aging, rival boxers that would meet in the ring one last time, I vividly remember social networks and blogs dedicated to film buzzing about the plethora of opportunities that this pairing could entail. Pairing the actors who brought classic movie characters such as the Raging Bull and the Italian Stallion to life would both team up to do a film that would ostensibly tackle the issues of older boxers, legacy, and unsolved contention, while showcasing the talents of two superb leading men.It's a little bit sad to note that the film we got, which could've easily merited Oscar nominations and worldwide acclaim, has turned into an only-moderately successful picture with some serious issues. Yes, I recommend 'Grudge Match' and, yes, I find some of its commentary on the aforementioned issues rather stimulating and meaningful. However, the elements of a heavy-reliance on predictabilities, unnecessary and stereotypical supporting characters, and redundant jokes noticeably derail a project that undeniably has untold potential.The film centers around two Pittsburgh boxers by the name of Henry 'Razor' Sharp (Sylvester Stallone) and Billy 'The Kid' McDonnen (Robert De Niro), who became rivals after they each beat one another in two separate rounds. A rematch was predicted, but Razor retired, which eventually lead to The Kid's downfall after assuming a directionless career and life once his main rival retired. Many years later, Razor works at a shipyard, while Kid is wasting away in addition. Out of the blue, Razor is approach by Dante Slate Jr. (Kevin Hart), a promoter who wants to have Razor and Kid do voicework for a forthcoming boxing video game where both boxers will be playable characters. While on the set, geared up in motion capture suits and ready to imitate their respective video game characters, Razor and Kid see each other for the first time in years on the set and begin to lash out at each other, throwing whatever they can find at one another.Turns out, one of the designers videotaped the fight, uploaded it to the internet and, as a result, the video went viral, became the main headline for sports shows, and has effectively created a resurgence of interest in Razor and Kid and their inconclusive rivalry. Slate decides to sponsor the rematch, to which the boxers accept, with Razor hiring the codgerly but motivational Louis 'Lightning' Conlon (Alan Arkin) and Kid reaching out to his estranged biological son B.J. (Jon Bernthal) in order to train him, much to the dismay of Sally (Kim Basinger), the love that got in the way of both boxers.Between Ron Howard's quickly-forgotten, underseen Rush, and now Grudge Match, it seems Hollywood is fascinated with the idea that two people can be rivals in a specific sport but still have respect for each other. Perhaps I'm a minority, but this never seemed to be a very unique idea. In fact, it would seem almost inferable. One has to have mutual respect for someone with a similar skillset and competence as them or else they wouldn't consider them a rival in the first place. Unlike Rush, Grudge Match doesn't seem to amuse and predicate itself off of the similar idea and instead makes the very smart move on treating its characters as humans.Grudge Match still bears scuffs in its material. For one, the humor is much too repetitive, to the point where jokes that should be funny fall flat instantly because they seem to bear punchlines we've heard in different variations. Rather than relying on some sort of poetic, conversational flow, Segal and the writers instead focus on cheap-shots, like boxers that have been bolted so hard on their craniums they forgot any other form of wit besides sarcasm and obvious jabs at one another (no pun intended). We hear time and time again that Razor is a quitter, Kid is chubby, both are old and geriatric and should be drinking Ensure to assure they stay alive not Muscle Milk to assure they stay fit (see, I can do it too), Lightning is older than the dirt he sleeps in, and Slate is obnoxious, short, and overly-excited.Give credit where credit is due in terms of Stallone and De Niro, who work damn hard at trying to make their characters work and connect on emotional levels. I'll be damned if by the end of the film, when the inevitable match roles around, I wasn't cheering for one over the other. The fight is riveting and often very exhilarating and that's thanks to the commitment of two actors who know their roles all too well and editor William Kerr, who beautifully captures some crushing blows.Ultimately, it's difficult to not be somewhat letdown by Grudge Match. Don't forget; Stallone stuck it through six, count 'em, six Rocky films and De Niro gained over twenty pounds to film the conclusion of Raging Bull. What's ironic is that Grudge Match manages to articulate where the actors are in their careers - plagued by what seems to be a lack of desire, interest, and ambition to do bigger and better things and are stuck in the shadow of whom they once were. The film is nicely put together, a thrill to watch at times, drab at others thanks to an onslaught of jokes that don't work because of their own ubiquity and overly-simplified supporting characters, but a moderately-successful package overall.",8,3,3,22 April 2014
Pawn Sacrifice," A film stuck on fast-forward, so much so that it almost eclipses a wonderful, observant performance
","Edward Zwick's 'Pawn Sacrifice' concerns American grandmaster Bobby Fischer (Tobey Maguire), a man who sky-rocketed from a humble chess prodigy in Brooklyn to a globally recognized name. Bobby grew up modestly, but was constantly burdened by nobody other than himself. He had a very low tolerance for loud noises and persistent distractions; all he wanted to do was to play chess in peace and, in turn, be the best player in the entire world. Ironically, what he got was deafening noise and an audience of the entire world.After making the rounds as one of the youngest up-and-comers of the American chess world, Bobby voices his desire to beat all the chess greats in the Soviet Union in the 1970's. To earn the title of the world grandmaster, Bobby would have to beat the Soviet's greatest player, Boris Spassky (Liev Schreiber), in the 1972 World Chess Competition. Bobby makes clear that he is not a political man; he simply wants to win and to accept all the glory that comes with being the greatest chess player of all time.The problem is that Bobby, who already seems to be teetering on the very edge of a mental breakdown every two minutes, spends more time practicing - going as far as to practice with one of his coaches by having a verbal game of chess - than trying to cope with his mental illness. At one point in the film, Bobby is said to be suffering from a form of paranoid schizophrenia, which makes sense seeing as how, during scenes of stress or extreme concentration, Bobby begins embellishing every little background noise (a flickering camera, the tapping of a pencil's eraser, lips smacking, etc) as if it were loud music at a house party. During these scenes, Zwick smothers us with these sounds as if we're Bobby, victim to hearing every noise as if it were right next to our ears. These particular scenes feel very authentic and do something cinema rarely does, which is attempt to make us feel how our protagonist does in the present.With that, Maguire gives his best performance since 'Brothers' in a role that challenges him in a similar manner. In 'Brothers,' Maguire played a war-torn veteran suffering from post-traumatic-stress-disorder and, upon returning home, encountered an entirely new battle with his wife. His performance in that film was incredibly strong, especially the last twenty minutes, where Maguire displayed some of the most violent and unbelievably convincing acting of his career. Here, his Bobby Fischer character is burdened with the same albatross; he suffers from something he has no control over that slowly eats at him until he is entirely unable to focus. His illness handicaps him throughout his quest to defeat the Soviet chess players, and when we see how badly Bobby wants to win, in spite of himself, there is an extra layer of sadness to his struggle.The problem with 'Pawn Sacrifice' is it feels a bit too much like a film stuck on fast-forward. Zwick, writer Steven Knight, and editor Steven Rosenblum conduct the film with a great deal of montages, especially during the chess games, that creates an appalling lack of investment and suspense. It seems to be a sign of insecurity over the material, as if the audience that was already attracted to the material would grow bored over watching a simple chess game. The concern is logical, but when we see how Zwick handles the more crucial games we get to see Bobby play in certain detail, it's only perplexing to wonder why Zwick decided to confine most of the game to a montage. The result, when we do get to see the cause-and-effect relationship with the players and their pieces, even if we know nothing about chess, is surprisingly gripping and naturally suspenseful, something I didn't see happening.Unfortunately, too, we also don't get much development on the Soviet players, and for how great Spassky is said to be, and how assured and commendable Liev Schreiber has been as an actor over the last few years, it's almost criminal that we do not see him nor his character shine at any point in the film. Much like Bobby's other opponents, they are cold shells that walk around in dapper clothing and with an unfazed smug on their faces.'Pawn Sacrifice' can be a great many things; sometimes an engulfing thriller about dealing with one's self, a suspenseful sports film, and a nicely edited and acted biopic, it sadly suffers from a presumable lack of confidence with its source material, in addition to a lack of development. It's a film to watch, digest, and to try not to forget on bigger terms than just its singularly strong performance what with the multitude of great film surely upon us in coming months.",6,2,7,26 September 2015
Magic Mike XXL," Moves with the fluidity of water-based lubricant and charms like a serenading male stripper
","Upon release, I called the original 'Magic Mike' 'a film of depth and certainty' and still hold it in high regard to this day, an opinion I'm frequently prodded for having. The fact of the matter was 'Magic Mike' was a film that was enjoyable as a piece of fluff that showed off the talent and athleticism of its leading male performers and also found a great deal of success as a drama about gritty business and toxic relationships in a fairly seamy field.'Magic Mike XXL' is in the perfect position as a sequel to degrade its predecessor by pulling a 'gotcha' at the audience, discarding all of its thoughtfulness in exchange for overdoing everything it did with such nuance in the first film. It could've been an endurance test of the highest degree, soaking everything in testosterone and surface-level dance numbers that would, in turn, add nothing to these characters and their personalities.Thankfully, writer Reid Carolin and director Gregory Jacobs take over the roles from the master Steven Soderbergh to deliver a film that does everything its predecessor does in a manner that relatively mirrors it but not to a fault. A sequel like this operates on a field of landmines, with the possibility of veering into all glitz and tiresome dance numbers at every turn, but Carolin and Jacobs remind us why the original film captivated us so much by giving us a film about human pleasure and the desire to arouse and excite.We refocus on our titular character (reprised by Channing Tatum), who is now the CEO of his own company and is making a living away from dancing. When he is contacted by Tarzan (Kevin Nash), who lies and says that their old friend and coworker Dallas (Matthew McConaughey in the original film) has died, Mike rushes to find that Dallas went to perform overseas and the guys lied to him simply so they could see him again.Upon listening his old friends and dancers such as Ken (Matt Bomer), 'Big Dick Richie' (Joe Manganiello), Tito (Adam Rodriguez), and their new friend Tobias (Gabriel Iglesias in a role that, despite the unlikely, rather fits him) tell stories, Mike finds the spark for dancing rekindled. He decides to drop everything and head down to Myrtle Beach with his buddies for one last dance to prove multiple different things. For one, Mike wants to prove that he still has what it takes to be a talented dancer but the other is something greater, something all the guys quietly want to prove.Mike and the gang want to prove that they still have what it takes to make a woman happy, joyful, and filled with the kind of excitement that she desires when venturing out to a strip club with her female friends on a Friday or Saturday night. Consider the scene when the boys are high off Ecstasy and dare Richie to waltz into a gas station and make the unhappy older woman behind the counter smile with a dance routine to the Backstreet Boys. The scene is uproariously funny and one of the most positive scenes I have yet to see this year, but it also works to prove to these men that they can still give a woman the fun she wanted.More of this insecurity sets in during a large bachelorette party that has Andre (Donald Glover), an R&B/rap singer and professional dancer, at the helm. Andre is a younger, ostensibly more energetic presence than the former 'Kings of Tampa' and his ability to dance flawlessly and make up an impromptu song for the women he serenades puts him clearly at the top of his game. Mike and his friends, who watch Andre put on his show, attempt to change up their routine before they hit Myrtle Beach, to show the town that they can still do what those half their age can and do it better.Soderbergh's directorial flare kicked in with 'Magic Mike' during the spacious dance scenes, which showed the entire stage as a playground for Soderbergh's tricks, with lighting, decorations, and choreography being placed at the forefront during as well. While Jacobs has less of an opportunity to showcase the large-scale stage dances, he makes up for it in the multitude of different ways he finds to shoot bodies bouncing off of one another. 'Magic Mike XXL' has so many scenes including people of both sexes being lifted up, landing face first in crotches, sliding off of one another, and working off different bodies that it almost becomes an action film. Jacobs captures these scenes with intense clarity and focus, living up to the Soderbergh-style of direction I anticipated watching this film.Ultimately, however, the sincerity behind the emotion in 'Magic Mike XXL' carries it places. Long scenes that take place in one setting, whether they are in a gas station or a luxurious home sipping rare and expensive wine with older (and younger) women, Carolin understands that this particular film can lack a 'point A/point B' plot and still be a worthwhile experience. The plotlessness of 'Magic Mike XXL' allows for conversations and real human connection to take place in a way that's remarkably beautiful, and I'll be damned if this doesn't end up being one of my favorite films of the year in terms of showcasing the human spirit in its most tender forms.NOTE: 'Magic Mike XXL' is also one of the few films that could end with the song 'All I Do is Win' by DJ Khaled and have it be totally fitting and not have it be pompous or flashy at all. This entire franchise has been a cinematic mystery waiting to be defined.",9,4,30,1 July 2015
Lincoln," A capsule of a great president and a director's increasing maturity
","Daniel Day-Lewis is something of an unsung miracle; the man will come out of nowhere, select an unlikely role, knock it out of the park, then quietly crawl back into the ground for the next three or four years before repeating the same process. He is an underrated talent most likely due to his lack of a prolific career, somewhat like director Terrence Malick. Here, Day-Lewis teams up with one of Hollywood's most prolific men, Steven Spielberg, who is coming off a stellar 2011, where he produced both Super 8 and Transformers: Dark of the Moon and directed both The Adventures of Tintin and War Horse, two acclaimed pictures.Spielberg mans the camera in one of the most exhilarating biopics in recent memory. Lincoln is a stunning humanization and coloring-book job of American politics, shedding a light on the skepticism and grayness of the government during that time. To simplify the story, Spielberg chooses to focus on the political interworkings of our sixteenth president's cabinet rather than the Civil War itself. It shows the long, grating process of amending the United States' constitution for the thirteenth time to abolish slavery and grant African Americans equality, and how that more than one men stood at the center of the action when the process was taking place, along with how he was incorruptibly confident that ending the practice of slavery will lead to ending the war.While titled 'Lincoln,' we get several other characters with a fairly surprising amount of screen time. Among them are Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing Lincoln's oldest son, Robert Todd, Tommy Lee Jones playing Thaddeus Stevens, the fiery Radical Republican leader who is strongly passionate about abolitionism, Sally Field as the president's devoted wife, Mary Todd, and David Strathairn as William Seward, the secretary of state. It could also be said that at times Abraham Lincoln is not writer Tony Kushner's (who also penned Spielberg's Munich, unseen by me) prime focus, as much as it is the backroom deals of the 1865 congress and the political battles and obstacles each member faced when their morals and ideology came forth in abolishing one of the most inhumane acts ever allowed in the United States.Daniel Day-Lewis is mesmerizing here, never overplaying or shortchanging Lincoln in one of his most reliable roles yet. Here, he seems much more cinematic than his previous works, and seems to be smitten with Lincoln's character and persona as he embodies him for one-hundred and fifty minutes. His voice is not stereotypically deep manly, and guttural as many other works have made him out to be, but reedy and poetically satisfying, boasting not much more than historical records claim. Day-Lewis is only assisted by the wealth of invaluable talent he is surrounded by, yet some of the most powerful work of his career comes out when Lincoln is reciting stories or parables to a group of bewildered, yet fascinated individuals who recall and cherish every word the man is saying.One requirement upon seeing Lincoln is you must commit to two and a half hours of dialog and monologues from several characters about several different topics. One challenge faced by the filmmakers that is inherently difficult to overcome is the wealth of information, history, and knowledge of the period, and we see the struggle they face at attempting to sum it all up into a structured, disciplined film. I could've seen this as an HBO ten to fifteen part miniseries, elaborating on smaller characters, extending the work of the amendment, and even showing Lincoln's impact on a still vulnerable United States. But such an action may have proved too heavy for even history buffs.With this film, there is a lot going on in terms of subtleties and there is a plethora of weight that rests on the film's script that at times makes this a challenging picture to watch. I'm reminded of my recent adventure to see the Wachowski's Cloud Atlas, and how that film was beautiful, striking, and increasingly ambitious, but also maddening and occasionally tedious. I wouldn't so much call Lincoln maddening or tedious as I would challenging to stay in-tuned with.But that does not mean I couldn't see thousands of people emerging pleased and delighted with the film they just saw. This is a richly detailed and unsurprisingly intellectual picture that will go down as one of the greatest cinematic endeavors to ever focus on American politics. Kushner and Spielberg have gone on to make quite possibly the best film we'll ever see about the passage of an amendment through congress and the exhausting compromises and deals that go along with the process. Finally, I must note Spielberg's top notch use of subversive elements from Lincoln's voice, to the focus of the picture from a narrative point of view, to the inevitable conclusion that still leaves us impacted and shaken.Starring: Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, David Strathairn, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, James Spader, Hal Holbrook, Tommy Lee Jones, and Jackie Earle Haley.

Garden State," 'But aren't we all'
","I would love to find a woman like Natalie Portman's Sam in Garden State. Someone who is quirky, but not to the point of being difficult to take seriously. Someone with a sort of effervescent charm, but one that doesn't quickly become overcompensating. And just someone that will listen and trust me as a person. But like Zach Braff's Andrew Largeman in the film, I have a lot to go through before that can happen.Andrew is a Los Angeles based actor who returns home to New Jersey after his father calls to tell him his mother has died. Andrew has been kept in a place for physic evaluation after his addiction to antidepressants nearly lead to his downfall. Upon returning home, he spends his days aimlessly wandering around the town, reacquainting with old friends, and just trying to come to terms with life and its many mysteries. But aren't we all.He eventually meets Sam, an offbeat woman who claims to be a pathological liar and is just all around strange and off-putting to someone with a closed-mind. I was beginning to write off Garden State as unconvincing indie-fare until I was met with Natalie Portman's character, who breeds life into a film that was desperately seeking it up until that point in time. As always, I've found her to be one of the most charming actresses, and here, she comfortably fills her character with the eccentricities and motifs she's uniformly known for.The two hit it off, and for the remainder of the film, exchange in bizarre conversations, discuss how 'screwed up' each of their families are, and while Andrew always appears sulky and directionless, Sam seems to always be overflowing with an unidentifiable joy. This is most likely why she has been dubbed the 'manic pixie dream girl,' a stereotype which can be applied here rather fittingly.Braff's sensitive direction works in the film's favor, and he appears to be a young prodigy when it comes to directing characters and uses a variety of exciting shots to prevent monotony. However, monotony comes into play due to the screenplay's lack of ideas. I mentioned how I was pleased to see a character like Natalie Portman's Sam walk on screen, but in the end, it was not a strong enough thing for me to recommend the entire one-hundred and three minute experience. The experience is overlong, tedious, sometimes dreadfully noneventful, and all around, vaguely uninteresting. This sort of romance was documented much more powerful in (500) Days of Summer.Somehow, I feel that if this film didn't immediately bandwagon the 'indie, hipster' genre of film that is increasingly becoming so popular and took a more nonchalant, modest approach in terms of writing, this wouldn't have happened. I too feel that this is a setup that heads straight in the direction of humanity-driven mumblecore, and in the hands of the Duplass brothers, this would've become a very miraculous film. Put in the hands of a first time director, it comes off as a rather shaky first step, but you can still tell and feel that something bigger and more divine is likely to emerge.I find myself placing Garden State beside the three Wes Anderson pictures I don't totally adore or recommend but feel that there is something there I am just unable to grasp. I can see some people loving the film and that is perfectly acceptable, and in that case, I encourage readers to disregard my opinion. It's truly difficult to explain why I am not recommending Garden State as a whole. It is filled with whimsy and charisma, but it never does much with either, and I can only sum it up like I summed up Wes Anderson's Rushmore; it wasn't that funny and it wasn't that interesting.Starring: Zach Braff and Natalie Portman.

Big Hero 6," Predictably strong animation; unpredictably stronger themes
","It didn't really hit me why I eagerly anticipate animated films each and every year, whether they be from high stakes studios like Pixar and Disney or low-key efforts from Blue Sky Animation or Rainmaker Entertainment. To me, every animated film is an opportunity to showcase different writing and directing talents, as animated studios rarely keep the same director for every single project. Sure you have directors like John Lasseter or Pete Docter that frequently direct films for certain studios, but often, you get a solid variety of films made by people you've never heard of and that provides for a film experience akin to watching a filmmaker's directorial debut.I only noticed this when I reflected on the bulk of Disney's films at the turn of the decade, from the enjoyable 'Tangled,' to the joyous 'Winnie the Pooh,' the incredibly fun and, my personal favorite in years, 'Wreck-It Ralph,' and the beloved and cherished 'Frozen,' the studio has consistently churned out a wide variety of films from a barrage of talented people. Disney's latest, 'Big Hero 6,' as expected, is no exception; this is a briskly-paced and different film for the animation studio, as it adopts a structure more akin to the one we've seen Marvel take on in recent years, and creates a film from the ground up that keeps its morals in check and its checklist of adventures in mind every step of the way.The film follows Hiro Hamada (voiced by Ryan Potter), a fourteen-year-old technology prodigy from San Fransokyo, a city built and thriving on technological innovation. Hiro, despite having the intelligence and time to spend on debatably more significant projects, enjoys the concept and strategy of 'bot fighting,' or the act of two small robots dueling until ones destruction. Hiro is kept in line and motivated by the work of his older brother Tadashi Hamada (Daniel Henney), a skilled engineer, who has created a tubby white robot named 'Baymax' (Scott Adsit), who is designed to monetize the healthcare system in America by providing non-threatening and responsive care upon hearing the expression 'ow' from a person.In the midst of all this, Hiro gets in contact with Professor Robert Callaghan (James Cromwell), a renowned technology guru who becomes attracted to the fourteen-year-old upon viewing a tutorial of his invention of 'mircobots.' Microbots' are tiny, metallic links that swarm and fit together to create whatever the human mind can imagine, proposing immense innovations and efficiency in architecture and transportation. However, after tragedy strikes, Hiro's motivation flatlines, and it's only him, Baymax, and a group of Tadashi's loyal workers that can stop a potential threat to technological and scientific evil.When Hiro and his band of inventors band together to form a group of superheroes, 'Big Hero 6″ easily could've opted for a sound and lights show, disregarding all the potential morals and ideas it laid so neatly on the table. However, despite a narrative structure that reminds us of the many Marvel superhero films we've seen this year, 'Big Hero 6″ keeps key morals in place, some of which are understanding the differences between external and internal pain, as brought on by the presence of Baymax and how unprecedented scientific innovations can be used simultaneously for good and bad. We see all of these ideas pan out and develop over the course of the film's runtime and never does the film become too rushed or too simplified to the point where lofty morals are sacrificed for rock-em sock-em action; the balance is delicate and well worth commending.On top of great, sound morals, 'Big Hero 6″ instantly wins thanks to a cuddly and lovable hero, Baymax, who finds ways to charm with his straight-forward nature and his strive to make everyone around him comfortable. Baymax steals almost every scene he is in, and meshes quite well with the other characters, working germane to their characteristics and never undermining the true force of Hiro as a character. The film, in addition, is predictably gorgeous, with eye-popping colors and wonderfully animated surroundings, effectively delivering the aesthetics as well as the morals in a neatly-wrapped package. 'Big Hero 6″ may not rank as highly as 'Wreck-It Ralph,' but seeing as it operates on a minefield of pitfalls and destructive forces, the fact it succeeds this well is a small miracle in itself.",8,29,41,2 December 2014
Dumb and Dumber," Fun for a while
","Dumb and Dumber is one of those films I watched when I was a kid. I watched it up until Lloyd was daydreaming at the wheel of the car about his dreamgirl, Mary and then shut it off. I liked it up until the state of events about the bumbling crooks, the suitcase full of money, etc. I didn't want the film to be about that. I wanted it to be about two idiots getting into trouble. Not all this serious crap going on.Now that it's been about eight years since I've seen it, I appreciate the film a bit more now. The first forty five minutes of the film are very entertaining and very funny. I laughed a lot in that time frame. Then once the film gets more and more about the crooks, and less about the antics of the two goofball leads I started to care less and less about the outcome.The plot: Lloyd (Carrey) and Harry (Daniels) are two slackers who are trying to save enough money to go into business selling worm related novelties and 'worm-farms.' Lloyd is a limo driver, and Harry is a dog-groomer. One day, while taxiing a beautiful women to the airport (Holly), Lloyd noticed she leaves a suitcase on the ground (purposely). The suitcase was left for two henchman to have. Lloyd swoops in and retrieves the case much to the dismay of the henchman who now believe Lloyd works for someone who is planning to disrupt their plan.Lloyd and Harry aren't aware that they are prey to two dangerous henchman, so they now go on a trip from Rhode Island to Aspen to give the beautiful women her suitcase back. Which obviously leads to slapsticky antics by both of the leads.The jokes are hit or miss, but there are scenes like at the diner and when the guys get pulled over that I can help but laugh at. They are right up my alley those kind of scenes. My favorite line in the film is when Harry and Lloyd go to Nebraska instead of Aspen. Both are expecting to see The Rocky Mountains, but seeing Nebraska is flat as a board Jim Carrey states 'John Denver is full of s**t, man!' Had me laughing out loud for minutes. Both Carrey and Daniels give surprisingly great performances. I say surprisingly because I'm rather not too fond of Jim Carrey because in many of his films he seems to be off his own medicine, or just running around like a dumbass for ninety minutes. In this film he does a rather humorous role, and is actually a pleasure to have on screen.I would give this film a better review it had been about the two trying to start their own business. I'm rather not too fond of the film's plot because I don't care about the goofs trying to flee from thugs. The whole joke is that they don't know they're prey, and are pretty much going with the flow on the whole trip. If the film would've played like a better comedy instead of throwing this ho-hum plot at us maybe I would've appreciated it more.Dumb and Dumber is good slapstick material, but it doesn't compete to slapstick gold like Tommy Boy and Black Sheep. Black Sheep is one of my favorite films, and has one of my favorite actors in it too, Chris Farley obviously. Dumb and Dumber was said to put The Farrelly Brothers on the map. This was followed by films like Me, Myself & Irene and There's Something About Mary. Who would've thought that a movie about two dopes would've gave two brothers a successful career. That is so dumb, fo' real.Starring: Jim Carrey, Jeff Daniels, and Lauren Holly. Directed by: Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly.",6,2,5,7 March 2011
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," The Holocaust through an eight year old's eyes
","The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is based off the novel of the same name by author John Boyne. Right of the bat, it's uniqueness stems from how the film's perspective is set. Rather than having the story be centered around adults in the Concentration Camp, or even Nazi officers, it's set through the eyes of a perky eight year old with an open mind and a curious sense. Having never read the book, I can't say if it follows the story pin-point detail, but it sure seemed like director Mark Herman knew what he was doing from the start of production.The Holocaust is a tender time, and I'm not always in the mood to watch a film about it. I did see the 2004 documentary about a school in Tennessee, Paper Clips, but never saw the 1993 Schindler's List. Because The Holocaust is a tender historical event, I don't always want to watch something about it and sometimes avoid films that's plot is centered around it since I'm easily emotional. Though whenever I watch a film about The Holocaust I usually wind up enjoying it, but better safe than sorry.The plot: Bruno (Butterfield) is an eight year old boy forced to move from Berlin to the countryside with his mom Elsa (Farmiga), SS officer father Ralf (Thewlis), and his twelve year old sibling Gretel (Beattie). While getting acquainted with the changes, Bruno finds a Jewish boy of the same age on the opposite side of a barbed wire fence. The boy's name is Shmuel (Scanlon) and he opens up to Bruno, telling him that him and his family are forced to wear 'striped pajamas' because him and his family are Jewish. Bruno of course has no clue what all of this means, but winds up becoming close with Shmuel and ignoring his parents dislike of Jews.The film is deep in some scenes, but one thing that let me down was that Bruno and Shmuel don't have many dialog scenes together as I would've thought. They have quite a few, but not as many as one would hope. Striped Pajamas however changes around the middle of the film to focusing more on the parents than the boy. Very cool set up here that we aren't faced with so much.How sad the film will make you depends on the kind of person you are. I've been known to get extremely emotional to films, but this one didn't bother me so much because I predicted the ending about halfway through. It's still definitely an informative movie and a very interesting, unique look on The Holocaust itself. After all this time I put off the movie, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas proves to be more than meets the eye and the title. Whats one supposed to think when they read the title The Boy in the Striped Pajamas? A five year old kid's trip to K-Mart? Starring: Asa Butterfield, Vera Farmiga, David Thewlis, Jack Scanlon, David Hayman, and Rupert Friend. Directed by: Mark Herman.",8,2,3,28 November 2010
Brave," A subversive magic trick
","I think Pixar's last two films have perfectly replicated how bipolar and easily disappointed a studio's fans can be when they decide to go in a different direction or, the second they make something they aren't fond of, they immediately lose all hope in them ever bouncing back. Of course I'm talking about the immense hate Cars 2 got last year and how obvious skepticism rang during the coming weeks of Brave's theatrical run.Cars 2 is, in my opinion, the weakest Pixar movie, but it still managed to earn a positive review from me due to its entertaining setup, kinetic energy, entertaining characters, and clear inspiration from Lasseter and everyone involved. It was pleasant entertainment, but lacked the emotional drama and the subversive narrative that recurred in a Pixar spectacle, not to mention, completely abandoning the original film's beautifully mosaic nostalgia and heavy themes of change and adapting to a new way of life. All and all, while fun, we can see one of the direct motivations to make the sequel was the original Cars film, while churning the lowest profits theatrically and being the first Pixar film to not garner a critical consensus of 'positive,' grossed $8 billion in merchandise, and by making a sequel, they could usher in a new line of toys while welcoming huge profits commercially.Now comes Brave, unfortunately victim to the pungent aftertaste Cars 2 left in many audiences' mouths. Had this come out when the company just began, say 1998, instead of A Bug's Life, when Pixar hadn't even begun showing audiences what they could do, perhaps it would've been viewed differently. The story is simple enough; Merida (voiced by Kelly Macdonald) is the teenage daughter of King Fergus (Billy Connolly) and Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson) who is required to become a princess thanks to her mother's strict, unforgiving rules and the outdated traditions of the Scottish land. Her mother plans an arranged marriage between her and another man, while neglecting the fact that her daughter has a whole other agenda she wants to pursue. An agenda that allows her to be a free-spirited archer, and a brave, fearless woman of power.Thirty minutes into Brave left me somewhat underwhelmed. The animation, as expected, was evoking and extravagant, but the storyline screamed Disney instead of Pixar. I felt little involvement with the film and its characters, little urgency, and little originality between scenes and found the slapstick humor encompassed way more of the film than it should be entitled to. Then, sometime during the second act it hit me...One must recognize first and foremost that while this will not be a subversive Pixar film like Toy Story, WALL-E, or Cars, but a fairy tale with compromising story devices from Disney and Pixar. Clearly, Disney's influence on the picture's look, story, and characters shines through more than Pixar's, but extracting the morals and the impact of this picture is what really gives us the idea that Pixar had more influence on the crafty, genuine themes and moral setups. To begin with, there is no love story, at all. You think there will be during the competition in the beginning to win Merida's hand in marriage, but it is quickly abandoned for good reasons.Secondly, we are spared the story of a young, directionless teenager who can't find out what to do with her life. The kicker here is we already know what Merida wants to do and she does to; be a more open, free-spirit, riding horseback, equipped with her trusty bow and arrow. While she is self-aware and confident, here problem lies with her mother's resistance to let her pursue such a dream and therefore, she is not roadblocked by indecisive life choices, but indecisive others.And finally, we see a beautiful portrayal of a mother-daughter relationship and how defying tradition is frightening at first, but a compromise between the two parties can be reached in some way. To hear people call the Merida character 'whiny' and 'selfish' pains me greatly. Put those people in Merida's shoes, where they are victim to a stubborn, controlling ideology, outdated traditions, and forced to do things that will not better them as a whole, and see what they'd rather do; stay confined or break free from the shackles of convention to be their own person.As stated before, the animation here is just gorgeous, with evocative shots of Scottish landscapes, thrilling scenes of horseback riding, and heavy emphasis on Merida's long, luscious red hair flowing in the wind as she races through the forests of her home. This could possibly be viewed as the least colorful Pixar film, considering it has more of a 'green, gray, and teal' color scheme, where as every other Pixar film occupies a poster with colors of the rainbow. I, however, see no flaws with the look, style, or feel of this film and the fluency and liveliness between characters and dialog is commendable.Nonetheless, Brave, for now, will be the red-headed (no pun intended) stepchild of the Pixar family, unless in years down the line, when the company has surely made more groundbreakers, audiences and fanboys will look back at this and reminisce their foolish hatred for a film that is deeper and more narratively satisfying than many gave credit for. Can this be viewed as one of the weaker films by the renowned studio? Definitely; it is a bit more reliant on slapstick humor than the many other wonderful pictures, but the more I examine this picture, the more I realize that all of this material may be subversive after all.Voiced by: Kelly Macdonald, Billy Connolly, and Emma Thompson.

Guardians of the Galaxy," 'You're fine, and you're mine, and you look so divine'
","James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy has a defining scene late in its runtime and it's the kind of scene that summarizes its characters, situations, and humor in ways better than any analysis could do justice. The scene comes when our titular heroes are gathered in their bunker, confused and trying to concoct and develop more of their '12% plan.' When they finally figure something out, each character stands up to declare their participation with Rocket Raccoon standing up last. 'Now we're all standing,' he states, 'a bunch of jackasses.' That is the best summation of Guardians of the Galaxy I've ever heard and probably will hear. The film works largely in part because it's a more lax, carefree Marvel film than we've seen over the last year or so, unburdened by the commonalities the brand has bestowed upon and the smothering sameness gift-wrapped in expensive special effects and complex pyrotechnics. While the effects and the sound engineering/mixing are nothing to shortchange or overlook, this has to be the most witty, hilarious, and consistently fun Marvel film I have yet to see, which is something the company genuinely needed in their long line of serious franchises.The film concerns Peter 'Star-Lord' Quill (Chris Pratt), who was abducted from Earth by The Ravagers in 1988, shortly after his mother's death. Twenty-six years later, Star-Lord is wandering on the planet Morag when he finds a small, spherical orb that apparently holds enough significance that the evil villain Ronan places a bounty on Star-Lord's head once he learns the orb is in his possession. He also sends Gamora (Zoe Saldana), an orphan who was trained by the arch-villain Thanos, after the orb. However, one afternoon, Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and his tree-like humanoid pal Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) see Star-Lord in public and try to capture him to obtain the large bounty. After a large, violent brawl, the quartet is thrown in prison and learn that the orb is worth several billion units. In order to obtain the units, however, they will need to trust each other entirely, which proves to be more of a challenge than it already is. They also come in contact with a large, muscular, and very literal man named Drax (David Bautista), who works to help them so they can be the noble Guardians of the Galaxy.Director and co-writer (with Nicole Perlman) Gunn knows that, unlike with Marvel's The Avengers, these heroes likely couldn't sustain a feature-film on their own. However, by throwing them together, giving them numerous dialog scenes to showcase their characters' timing and humor, and develop them each considerably with their own stories and motives, he can create a film centered around some of the most likable superhero characters. Despite being a superhero, Star-Lord is entirely human and relatable, from his sassy remarks to his love for eighties music (which leads me to believe that Redbone's infectious jam 'Come and Get Your Love' has never been used to greater effect than in Guardians of the Galaxy. Gamora shows her incredible energy through every scene, thanks to competent writing and a solid performance by Saldana, who seems to be just starting to break out of the female action hero archetype. Even Drax is the heart of some hilarious scenes, being that he doesn't quite understand metaphors and views everything in a firmly literal sense.But the scene-stealers are Rocket Raccoon and Groot, who compliment each other effortlessly well. Rocket Raccoon has his brash, sometimes vulgar sense of humor to back him up, consistently being an entertaining presence, while Groot's character and conversational simplicity make him a warm and easily-lovable soul. Together, the five create one of the most effortlessly fun and engaging band of heroes that challenge The Avengers in the sense that these characters don't appear to be impenetrable forces of nature. They're not invincible beings and exist on a realm that can be more directly relatable to the audience. In other words, they're the superheros for people that don't really care for superheroes.Marvel truly needed Guardians of the Galaxy in my mind; a casual, irreverent superhero film that shows misfit characters rather than polished ones and momentary pauses for some hilarious dialog rather than disjointed shouting and stale zingers. What Marvel also needed was a film that had a true sense of humor, rather than just infrequent winks to the camera or dopey little sequences of deadpan, which is what Guardians of the Galaxy bears in excess. This very feature is evident from the film's inclusion of a bold, memorable soundtrack, made up almost entirely of hits from the seventies and eighties, with the heroes' theme song 'Hooked on a Feeling' by Blue Suede at the film's center. While the battles are still pretty long and often infused with some indistinguishable chaos, this proves not to be such a distracting feature since the bulk of the film is such a royal and unexpected treat.In a time where I, and I'm willing to bet several others, are experiencing incredible superhero fatigue, Guardians of the Galaxy provides the ibuprofen and the regeneration the genre and the audience needed.Starring: Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, and David Bautista. Voiced by: Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel. Directed by: James Gunn.",9,2,7,3 August 2014
Evil Dead," Harmless, but not necessary
","Fede Alvarez's Evil Dead is likely the best film that could be made in current times bearing the title as Sam Raimi's cult classic. Nonetheless, it's a film that is always aware of its goal - to be as gory and as excessive as possible - and creates an easygoing vibe that will likely appeal to those who hold its original so dear to their hearts.This sort of depends on your response to the exclusion of the original film's main character, Ash, who was played by Bruce Campbell, who serves as an executive producer on this remake. His absence wasn't a big deal for a non-fan like myself, but I can sense something of an upset being that the film doesn't include its own main character. However, it's not like Friday the 13th without a Jason, or a visit to Elm Street without Freddy, so there isn't a huge hole in the film's interior.We focus on five kids that venture out to a remote cabin, only this time, they're going there for a slightly different reason; they're trying to get their friend Mia (Jane Levy) sober from drug abuse and get her back on the road to mental stability. The group winds up stumbling upon a book of the dead, which to add to ominousness, is inked in blood and bound by human flesh. It unleashes a demon into Mia, who in return, attempts to mutilate and butcher her friends, which will turn them into demons as well.If you want gore, you'll get enough gore for an entire horror franchise. With the original driving force behind The Evil Dead, Sam Raimi, still having a reasonable say in what goes on, the feel of the classic film is present alone in its abundance of bloodshed. Tongues are ripped in two, blood is vomited, flesh is frequently punctuated by knives, spears, glass, and whatnot, and violence and brutality is commonplace. I was astonished by how it is handled; not in the vein of another Hostel sequel, that would generate melancholic attitudes because of the constant brutality, but in the way where it is more of a novelty rather than a sickness. That's what, I believe, makes the film so fun and entertaining; it isn't so keen on being sick and nasty as it is on being a grotesque piece of entertainment.Gone besides Ash, however, is that feeling of raw, unnerving naturalism that was present heavily in the original film. Raimi's low budget endeavor seemed to be a surreal document of a trip went wrong, using original camera angles and woodsy videography to generate effective atmosphere and tone. This remake employs these tactics nicely, but with more of a well-refined, studio touch. Consider the POV-shots Alvarez attempts at, in order to effectively mimic (or perhaps pay tribute) similar sequences in the original film. They still work because we are unsure of what exactly it what the POV is from. However, they feel more polished and less amateur, which leaves us with more of a seldom appreciation than what we saw the first time around.This is the kind of horror film that effectively works, even though it has its own limitations. It still favors weirdness and gross-out instances over character (even though this one tries a bit harder to evoke personality with some of its cast), and character stupidity is rather prominent here. And yet, there is enjoyment to be had simply because the events are fun and lax and the buckets of gore (all natural, by the way - no CGI) are a shockingly pleasant addition. This doesn't have the unexpected setups, plot twists, and constant entertainment of recent efforts like The Cabin in the Woods and Final Destination 5, but it does have a heart and a sense of fun and terror.NOTE: My video review of Evil Dead, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YXN13tiA8I Starring: Jane Levy, Shiloh Fernandez, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jessica Lucas, and Elizabeth Blackmore.

The Imitation Game," A film carried by the strength of an actor and the intelligence of a writer
","The Imitation Game concerns Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch), an often unsung but wholly important figure of World War II, who worked as one of several code-breakers for Britain's secret Government Code and Cypher School. The men were a gaggle of mathematicians and linguists, who spent hours evaluating secret naval messages sent by the German's Enigma-software. Over three-thousand codes were sent through Enigma a day, and despite pervasive, around-the-clock work, the code was deemed 'unbreakable.' The Imitation Game follows Turing, an humble but ambitious man who worked to construct a machine to decode Enigma, as well as Turing's frequently abusive childhood, his relationship with Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley), a fellow-codebreaker, his other group members, and his personal recognition of his own homosexuality in a time when homosexuals were being charged with gross indecency.Alan Turing's story may be largely unknown by many people, but at least he has the honor of being played by Benedict Cumberbatch, one of the finest leading male actors working today. Much like his work in the now forgotten Fifth Estate last year, Cumberbatch is the stitching that holds The Imitation Game together, and makes the film more interesting than a film about code-breaking would suggest. He is meticulous in his portrayal of Turing, right down to mimicking his anxiousness and his often antisocial behavior, which would lead to him creating the Turing-Machine. Cumberbatch has always been an intriguing actor simply because he is eloquent and unpredictable in how he wants to approach the characters he plays, yet consistent in being a convincing screen-presence.Cumberbatch's acting ability is so strong he often distracts from some of The Imitation Game's lesser elements, such as the rather formulaic structure of the film, which cycles through flashbacks to tell stories in a vaguely disjointed manner. The film suffers from occasionally telling a remarkable story with either an indifference to the narrative structure or a foreseeable chronological timeline. Admittedly, however, screenwriter Graham Moore has quite the challenge at hand with The Imitation Game, as the material here isn't compelling in the traditional sense, and it's hard to concoct a great deal of suspense from a gaggle of guys trying to solve a cryptic message in one specific location. Because of this, Moore wisely decides to invite intrigue into the story rather than suspense, providing background to how Turing and company did their work and the meticulous process involved with cracking even a basic German message.In addition, The Imitation Game proves it's more of a thought-provoking, contemplative picture than anything when it shows off some of the year's most lackluster CGI in some of its action sequences. It's hard to place too much of an emphasis on the quality of the film's special effects, being that, again, the film is more about revealing the nature of the job of a code-cracker than anything else. However, the film features CGI that begs to be validated, as it almost looks as if the film was modeling itself after sequences taken from films over a decade old.Once again, though, it doesn't matter, for most people who will see The Imitation Game won't even bat an eye; they'll be too busy being completely amazed and captivated by the work of Cumberbatch and his ability to take a strange, off-kilter, but genius character and turn him into a human being through just a couple of scenes. Cumberbatch establishes Turing as not just an incredible man, but as a human, insecure, vulnerable, and unsure of himself when it comes to anything that doesn't involve his ability to create in just a few sequences, making most of the film centered on him and his issues for almost the entirety of its runtime. For an actor to not only be the foundation of a film, but the reason for the film's exceptional quality almost all around, sharing much of the glory with Moore, who competently structures the film around Turing as a human and works to make the film about the mystery of cracking the code, is quite the achievement.Starring: Benedict Cumberbatch, Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, Mark Strong, and Charles Dance.

Caddyshack," Makes me tee'd off at new films
","Golf was never as funny until the 1980's comedy classic Caddyshack was released. We always frown or roll our eyes when we see golf on one of our local channels, hogging the time for three or more hours. Then we think to this comedy and laugh. If Caddyshack can make a dull sport like golf funny, I'm waiting for Queballs or even Strikes to bring some excitement to the world of billiards or bowling.Caddyshack has an all-star comedy cast, but they seem to work best on the green rather than at dinner or out in the world. Bill Murray, Ted Knight, Chevy Chase, and Rodney Dangerfield are the funniest in this film when they are making snarky remarks at each other while trying to enjoy a game of golf, a game that is known for its calming, stress-free nature. The problem, is Caddyshack tries to concoct a love story between multiple groups and keeps trying to nudge its characters off the field. When you have a good cast that works well in a designated area why shun them away from that area? I would've been perfectly content with a movie that where more than half of it takes place on a golf course. Just as long as it featured the comedic talents of these four guys.There really is no plot either. Just well-developed characters that sustain the entire movie. There's Ty (Chase) the most laidback person in the world. Carl (Murray) the grounds-keeper of the course who spends most of the film trying to exterminate a pesky gopher who distracts other players. Al (Dangerfield) a rich real estate cad who does nothing but boast the whole film in his vulgar, yet undeniably hilarious ways. And, finally, Judge Elihu Smails (Knight) the co-founder of the course.If you take four parrots, caged them up for days without letting them out, then released them in a room with each other they would go nuts and frolic forever. That's exactly what Chase, Dangerfield, Knight, and Murray. They unleash each one of their special qualities out on the film. Which is what makes Caddyshack so funny and so memorable. It's quotable because of many comedic parties, and entertaining because their antics are unpredictable.This is one of the more subtle spoof films of all time. Caddyshack isn't marketed as a parody film, but it does bring comedic jokes about the game of golf and just makes it funny in its entirety. It doesn't go on a rampage trying to get as many references in as possible, but it winds up accomplishing more than any modern day spoof.If the Direct-to-DVD National Lampoon series now among us took time to pay closer attention to 'worthless' things like writing, casting, and humor, they could maybe pull off something like Caddyshack. Instead, they choose the easy way out by putting some bikini girl on the DVD cover hoping people will see this as an American Pie raunch-fest, when really, it's PG-13, and if it is R rated, it has very little to offer.Caddyshack doesn't try to hard and it still succeeds. The inspiration is the four leads who each make up a small part of a very successful film. It has no limits, no regrets, no mercy, and no shame.Starring: Bill Murray, Rodney Dangerfield, Chevy Chase, and Ted Knight. Directed by: Harold Ramis.",8,1,2,18 August 2011
The Evil Dead," Unapologetically gory and surprisingly very amusing
","The Evil Dead and its two sequels have achieved a small, but loyal cult following in the field of horror, showcasing likely some of the goriest brutality on film in the eighties. It follows a group of twentysomethings, Ash (Bruce Campbell), his girlfriend Linda (Betsy Baker), his sister Shelly (Sarah York), and his friends Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss) and Scotty (Hal Delrich) as they embark out to a remote cabin in the middle of the woods. They stumble upon 'The Book of the Dead,' which is inked in blood and bound by flesh, and unleashes a number of demons and evil spirits that quickly begin to take over the cabin and the souls inside. It's up to Ash, the cool-guy hero of the group to defeat the spirits and save his friends.The plot is, without a doubt, as standard as standard can get. At the end of the day, we come for the scares and the gore and that's exactly what we'll receive. Buckets and buckets of blood are utilized; one of the best scenes involves Ash puncturing a demon's eyes with both his thumbs, with huge amounts of blood quickly oozing out. Yet even with all this constant, flashy violence and gore, the film never veers off on the course of being sadistically exploitative or depressingly nihilistic. Its gore and violence isn't meant to be taken seriously or offensively. There's an aesthetic and tonal cheeriness to this material that is widely unexpected - especially in the eighties, when it seemed many horror films attempted to be as bleak as they possibly could be.Director Sam Raimi (who would later become known for not only his Evil Dead trilogy, but his Spider-Man films) knows how to employ terrific tactics when he works on horror movies. His presence and involvement with the 1980's horror film Intruder, while one of his more obscure films, definitely replicates a style that he would soon become affiliated with. Here, Raimi always seems to be trying something new, specifically with the camera angles. Consider the POV shot we get of someone (or something) gliding through the forestry near the cabin, even going as far as to colliding through the windows of the cabin. The trick to these scenes is we never know exactly what the POV is of, but we don't need to. We know it's not good, since it zips by at an unusual, lighting speed and makes the characters scream when they come in contact with it.These scenes work because Raimi largely knows when to utilize them and how to have them work accordingly with the cinematography. Shot on a roughly $350,000 budget, much of the atmosphere is presented through a lens concerned more with naturalism than polish. The presentation of the picture feels rawer and purer than many other horror films of the time period. This is yet another horror film that contributes to the thought that smaller budgets make better horror films in general.There isn't a whole lot to The Evil Dead. As a horror film, it features the obligatory faceless characters, little development, and devotion to smaller events that may or may not lead up to a grandiose finale. And yet, it works mainly because it aspires to be a bit more ambitious in the regards to its film techniques and gore usage. It's a delightful blend of black comedy and riveting horror excitement, which is a combination that is depressingly underutilized.Starring: Bruce Campbell, Betsy Baker, Sarah York, Ellen Sandweiss, and Hal Delrich.

Here Comes the Boom," Do yall really want it?
","Through his last few film roles, Kevin James has put a spell on me. His controlled goofiness, innocuous sweetness, and charming 'everyman' persona make him at least likable for roughly ninety minutes. Perhaps it is the tough times endured in our world, or my cynicism winding down, but through an unexplainable force I enjoyed Frank Coraci's Here Comes the Boom perfectly on its own merits. It delights with comedy and commentary, moves with its undertones, and achieves satisfaction without being too crass or too manipulative.Kevin James is Scott Voss, a biology teacher for a high school in deteriorating shape financially. Budget cutbacks proposed by one of the board members shows reverting back to salaries of the previous year, financial conservation, and the elimination of the school's music program. Voss, who seemed to be often lackadaisical and unmotivated during school hours, is reminded of the music director, Marty (Henry Winkler), an aging man who confides in him when he realizes that his wife is pregnant. He decides to take a stand for Marty and raise the $48,000 needed to save the music program by taking up mixed martial arts, when he discovers from a friend that just losing a professional match grants you $10,000, where winning grants you a whopping $50,000.Voss, who also teaches a citizenship class to cheery, optimistic immigrants, takes lessons from Holland-native Niko (real-life UFC heavyweight Bas Rutten), and is driven by the spirit and beauty of co-worker Bella Flores (Salma Hayek), who admires his doughy-self for pushing through in efforts to get a date with her. And so the odyssey begins, with Voss attempting to fight in numerous events, receiving money, and hoping to save the music program before the end of the year.I just finished reviewing Rob Cohen's Alex Cross, a polar-opposite from Here Comes the Boom. I introduced my critique by saying, 'We've seen Alex Cross before, in numerous other detective films, and even if we haven't, or can't quite recall where, somehow we arrive at the expected conclusion in our heads roughly twenty-five minutes before the characters of the film do.' The same statement applies for Here Comes the Boom. This story isn't original, subversive, or unpredictable, yet there's an incandescent charm to its story and a motivation to exercise full potential rather than be a lazy slog through screenplay odds and ends. This is the kind of entertainment that doesn't burden us, beat a moral over our heads, provide us with sappy emotional manipulation, and doesn't feel like it's taking away one-hundred and two minutes away from us in a criminal act.Kevin James' previous film was Zookeeper, directed by the same Frank Coraci. Despite the same well-meaning efforts being present there, its humor derived from mainly farcical concepts such as James' collapsing or the fact that him and a gorilla straight from the zoo were dining out at Applebee's. It was forgettable and almost entirely unremarkable. Here Comes the Boom, on the other hand, is sweeter and more concerned with humor deriving from wordplay or character relations. The matches between Voss and his competitors are not played for laughs or even petty remorse. They are fierce, slickly captured, and quite entertaining.Here Comes the Boom isn't that will be remembered as more than acceptable genre-fare and, in a sense, that's the way it should be. To overblow it to anything more is to completely over-compensate its worth as a film. It's not something to hold on the highest step on the pedestal. It's a film to appreciate once, maybe twice, and then move on. There are better pictures in this same genre lurking out there. Yet there are worse ones. Way worse ones.Starring: Kevin James, Salma Hayek, and Henry Winkler. Directed by: Frank Coraci.",7,0,1,6 February 2013
Jurassic World," A world of predators and we are the prey
","A fourth installment of the 'Jurassic Park' franchise has long been in the works, and if nothing else, its assembly at least gives this new generation something to warmly embrace that doesn't find itself cloaked in candy colors and Marvel branding. On my way to the theater, I kept trying to think of what I exactly wanted 'Jurassic World' to accomplish as a film, and it didn't take long to realize that I was over-analyzing a lot of my expectations. The only thing I wanted was the element of wonder and danger that was missing in the third installment, but heavily present in the first and underrated second film.On that note, 'Jurassic World' delivers quite a bit of suspense and exhilaration. I would even say it goes far beyond the thrill and intensity factor of the original film with what it chooses to show. There's much more blood and violence than in any of the previous films, and the special effects are some of the strongest the series has ever seen. Aside from occasionally appearing to be a Samsung sponsored commodity with the heavy emphasis on product placement, in addition to elements that almost seem like self-parody for a summer blockbuster, this is only one of the many summer blockbusters we've been spoiled to so early in the season.Our setting is Jurassic World, a monstrous theme park housing real-life dinosaurs, some of which genetically modified, that provides the thrills and excitements of living with dinosaurs. We immediately focus on Zach and Gray Mitchell (Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins), two young boys who venture out to Jurassic World to visit their Aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), who runs the park. Claire, however, is busy trying to attract financiers to see the park's new 'Indominus Rex,' one of the genetically modified dinosaurs that combines eight different species of animal to, in turn, create a humongous dinosaur.The park's main dinosaur trainer is Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), an ex-Navy member, who immediately works to help after a catastrophic turn of events has Indominus Rex leaving his concubine, wreaking havoc on the park. Numerous failed attempts to cage and detain the beast eventually result in several other dinosaurs being let out of their cages, causing for a complete meltdown of the entire facility. Despite lacking in proper artillery and being responsible for hundreds of thousands of lives, Owen and Claire work together to try and stop the beasts from terrorizing the park.The original 'Jurassic Park' worked so well because of its emphasis on peril. The film put you into a barrage of situations that felt like you were at the mercy of the same large, hulking beasts the characters on-screen were running from. 'Jurassic World' restores that element, constantly trapping the viewer in an awkward or frightening position, with Colin Trevorrow commanding controlled but large-scale direction at all times. This is the essence of why 'Jurassic World' is such a thrill; it plunges us into many different scenarios and gives us a variety of evocative landscapes and dinosaurs to feast our eyes on at all times.Through starring roles in some of Hollywood's loftiest and most expensive productions, Pratt has finally asserted his ability to command a presence. If 'Guardians of the Galaxy' didn't convince you that he wasn't on top of his game, 'Jurassic World' will be that deciding factor. He has the subtle, suave goofiness that doesn't make him bumbling and incompetent and the right amount of intelligence as a character actor to be taken seriously, and he rises to the occasion with this picture at every turn. His character is actually so interesting that it makes focusing on the two young boys feel like a burdened change in direction, mainly because Robinson's character is such a moody, unlikable teenager.In itself, 'Jurassic World''s burdens come in the form of excessive product placement, to the point where if Starbucks or Samsung isn't being shoved down our face, it's Coca-Cola or Beats by Dre. Some don't pick up on product placement as easily as others, but when we're immersed in a theme park setting like this, which is predominately wilderness as is, these sorts of things are much easier to spot, especially when it seems that Trevorrow is trying to make sure that said product is always at eye-level with the audience when it's in frame. Furthermore, there's the obvious element of events occurring to the characters' advantage just in the nick of time, which, while common for the summer blockbuster genre, is nonetheless cloying and overly obvious. We've already been asked to suspend our disbelief for dinosaurs, so scenes like a dead Pterodactyl's beak coming dangerously close to one of the young boys' faces before slowing to a halt feels like a cheap shot at suspense and convenience.These burdens, however, do not discourage the fun 'Jurassic World' brings. Few franchises from yesteryear that are revisited in the modern day have the ability to excite, but just hearing the name 'Jurassic Park' brings to mind a multitude of different visuals that capture the imagination. 'Jurassic World' is a testament to the imagination and proves, yet again, that even franchises that have laid dormant for several years can still get off the ground and morph into something worth watching.",7,12,35,13 June 2015
Paranormal Activity," Things that close doors and be a nuisance at night
","Paranormal Activity is not your typical horror film. There's no killer, no CGI, and thank goodness no Michael Bay. With a mere budget of $15,000 that will seemingly get you nowhere, Paranormal Activity proves wrong.The story concerns is a young dating couple 'played' by Katie Featherson and Micah Sloat. I put quotes around 'played' because they are themselves in the film, and they occupy their own names. There's one flaw in their relationship. Ever since her house burned, Katie has been haunted by demons. Mainly in the late night hours. 'Ghosts' slam the doors, looks of creaking sounds make up for the lack of music, and so on. The little things that make you flinch or jump in a horror film are now put in the foreground. They are the main scares of the film.Jump scares are those little instances where one of the characters turns around or something moves really fast, usually in the night time for added effect, and you hear an effect and a loud chord from the music. Normally, I'm against them. I, however, am not against suspense. In many current horror films, jump scares come seconds before an actual murder or something along those lines. The main flaw with jump scares is now that you've jumped up and flinched two or more times, the real murder will not seem as scary.Here's a scenario - a woman walking alone in an eerie forrest in the middle of the night. Nevermind why, but imagine she turns around once and you get a jump scare that makes you flinch. Imagine afterwards she looks the other way and you get another huge jump. Then finally, the killer comes out and attacks her. The murder doesn't seem as scary as it would with no jump scares because you clearly saw it coming. No film would deliberately tease you with loud, obnoxious jump scares if nothing would happen in that scene.But in Paranormal Activity, those jump scares are what we are waiting for. The suspense comes from the silence and the lack of music - we are waiting for something to make a loud noise so we can jump. Only in maybe two scenes I recall something actually happening that goes beyond a jump scare. It was the equivalent to a murder in a slasher film.The way the film is shot too does nothing but add to the creepy vibe. I've always been a huge fan of shot-on-video horror films, meaning the film is shot with a hand-held camcorder and no tripod. Someone in the film is holding it and filming it first person style. The same thing worked in 1999 when the horror film that shocked many The Blair Witch Project came out. While mocked now, the film is without a doubt eerie and is still filmed very realistically.The less you the better about Paranormal Activity the better, which is why I tried to shy away from major plot points and discoveries. I assume that maybe in ten years this will be looked seen as 'silly' and 'stupid,' but frankly, if you think about the realism, the quality, and the acting in the film, it's all believable, captivating, and powerful. It achieves many goals in elements that can easily be ruined in films like these. It at least deserves credit for that.Starring: Katie Featherson and Micah Sloat.

World Trade Center," 9/11/01 - We'll Never Forget
","'I'm just a singer of simple songs, I'm not a, real political man. I watch CNN, but I'm not sure I can tell ya, the difference in Iraq and Iran. But I know Jesus and I talk to God, and I remember this from when I was young. Faith, hope, and love are some good things that ya gave us, but the greatest is love.' - Alan Jackson, 'Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning'.Bravery, courage, struggle, and survival are the recurring themes in Oliver Stone's film World Trade Center. Today marks the ninth anniversary when the tragedy we know when two planes collided in both the Northern and Southern Tower and the Pentagon. It was a tragic day and I'm sure 95% of us know where we were when the moment/instant came when we were informed on the incident. I was home sick at five years old playing with blocks listening to CMT when all of a sudden it flashed to the picture of the North Tower with smoke billowing out of it. The concept of terrorism and a terrorist attack was foreign to a five year old so I assumed that it was either and accident or put on for a show. World Trade Center captures detail after detail down to the slightest spec of information on the two New York police officers who were buried under the rubble and debris left from the fallen South Tower. Both Nicholas Cage and Michael Pena give a four star performance and their strong acting rarely lets up.I want to start off by saying Nicholas Cage is on my list for worst actors. I've never found him amusing to watch and I've always thought of him as overrated and overpaid. He's done some fair movies in his career like Leaving Las Vegas and National Treasure, but overall his filmography is loaded with overbudget and overrated garbage that has the interest level of either a remake or a movie that's been done a million times. Much to my surprise, Cage gives a very respectable and highly amusing performance in this film. His acting skills are profoundly shown here and he brings out his life rather than just being someone who 'collects the check' in half of his movies. This one we see some of his best skills flood out on the screen like a never-ending wave of nourishment.If you're introduced to the story of the two New York police officers who were trapped under the rubble of the South Tower for hours, than the story is the exact same thing. We see the North Tower on fire ten minutes in the film, before you know it we see John McLaughlin and Will Jimeno inside the South Tower, and before you know it we see them under the South Tower. After they are called in, they arrive to the tower to see smoke just pouring out of the windows nonstop along with paper flying every which way like Mardi Gras confetti in the streets. So the scenery in the street shots are well done and recreated to the exact pin-point detail as they could've been.I too admire the fascination in the events/timeline of September 11, 2001. Great facts and different features stem from that day and even though it's a day looked on by many as a great tragedy, it has interesting perks that make it a very amusing concept to learn about. For example, the questionable devil's face appearing in the smoke of the South Tower and the news reports are something I find extremely interesting since seeing it at five years old left me with just vivid memories of newscasters viewing the incident. The most interesting shots/bits of information are most definitely the news reports when we see a plane crash. You can hear and almost taste the reaction/fear brought down by most. It's a creepy feeling when watching the plane hit the building, even to this day.World Trade Center is said not to be a political film by director himself Oliver Stone. While WTC is more of a disaster/docudrama then anything, I can tell it has the urge to strike up opinions on who's the better political party, Republican or Democrat. You can almost hence that the director wants to state his opinion on the matter, but instead just letting the characters take the lead in the recreation of the events taken place on September 11, 2001. Being very moved by the movie and the events taken place I call WTC a strong, powerful movie that not only captures the suspense and intensity of the day itself, but also takes into consideration the different points and dialog made by McLaughlin and Jimeno. The character's random and rambling dialog is definitely interesting and one of the strongest points of the movie without hesitation.Starring: Nicholas Cage, Michael Pena, Maria Bello, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Stephen Dorff, Jon Bernthal, Jay Hernandez, Michael Shannon, Donna Murphy, Frank Whaley, Jude Ciccolella, and Danny Nucci.

Black Snake Moan," Let it shine, let it shine, let is shine
","Black Snake Moan is an exploitation film that is sort of classy and presentable. Its focus isn't on gory violence or action set pieces, but characters, their pasts, and their present. Here is a film that has great actors, and set its sights mainly on their performances rather than their actions.The story centers around a blues singer turned farmer in the Deep South named Lazarus (Jackson) and nymphomaniac Rae (Ricci). They each pack their own emotional baggage, with Lazarus's wife cheating on him, leaving him frustrated and angry, and Rae's boyfriend Ronnie (Timberlake) leaving for deployment in the National Guard.Rae stumbles into Lazarus's clutches, when he finds her laying beaten and mutilated at the side of the road. He takes her in and lays her on the couch, before her awakening frightened and worried. Lazarus doesn't want to hurt her, but plans to lead her away from the life of promiscuity she has chosen to pursue. She has sex with anyone, and what will happen afterwards is a mystery to us and to her.To make sure she doesn't escape, Lazarus ties a huge metal chain around Rae's waist and the radiator. He is surrounded by thick, heavy wilderness, so it is certain no one will hear the madness unfolding. Thank goodness, because Lazarus and Rae exchange a number of four letter words and bitter dialog throughout the film, relentlessly achieving greatness in their performances.Samuel L. Jackson is marvelous here. I've read that he spent hours learning how to perfect blues music, and Ricci walked around scantily-clad all the time and ate a very minuscule amount during filming. In order to achieve a great performance, actors/actresses must immerse themselves in the roles of their characters. Jackson and Ricci do, and that's the main reason why the film works extremely well.Writer/Director Craig Brewer has done a fantastic job at not only showing the seamy atmosphere and troubles that exist in the Deep South, but also at creating characters we can sympathize with. Main characters we can not have an strong opinion about, show affection to, or sympathize with, in my book, are worthless characters.Black Snake Moan is constructed well, and never sees a dry moment. It has a keen sense of grittiness and possesses a desire to go as far as it can without being too implausible or cutesy. The performances are strong, the delivery is subtle, and the atmosphere is contagious. If there was a way to depict the Dirty South as a seamy place of optimism, then it was done perfectly.Starring: Samuel L. Jackson, Christina Ricci, and Justin Timberlake.

The Hangover Part II," Same same
","I can remember the last time I saw a sequel to a movie, I can't remember the last time I saw a sequel that was the exact same scheme and practically a remake of its predecessor. Literally, nothing changes, there is hardly a mention that the three leads have been through this exact same thing. They don't even seem to worry about the teenager they lost losing a finger. Everything is the same.Director Todd Phillips seem to think 'hey, they liked the first one, let's keep it the same and make it a different location.' I really must say the first Hangover film I was a big fan of. I thought it was smart, funny, and very heartfelt in places. Rarely do we see leads that are as funny as mystified as the audience. I liked that. Sadly, Phillips doesn't want to experiment and place these characters in different surroundings with them in different events, he literally seems to have taken the first script and moved it over to Bangkok. A sign of unoriginality, uncertainty, and above all, laziness.The plot, if I should bother to explain it, is the Wolfpack going to Bangkok to celebrate Stu's wedding. The night before the wedding, the wife thinks of a brilliant idea that the guys go out for one drink, and take her sixteen year old brother with her. I find it funny the thought of what could possibly happen to these three the night before a big wedding didn't even cross this woman's head. Not to mention putting them in charge of an adolescent.No big though, they go out, have a drink by the bon-fire, next thing you know they blackout and wake up in some rundown slum of an apartment in Bangkok. The adventure re-begins. We get the same jokes, the same antics, and the same characters giving their same performances.We have Phil, the calmest of the group, Stu the wimp, and Alan the idiot. The only two that manage to squeeze laughs are Mr. Chow (Jeong) and Alan. Chow's outrageous attitude and Alan's simple minded, softee persona both bring out the best The Hangover Part II has to offer.Most of the shots of Bangkok are the scummy and grungy parts of the city and most of which turn people off to a place like that. When in fact, Thailand is very exquisite in parts. Obviously, the filmmakers wanted to capture the blacker sides of town to show what kind of neighborhood the boys were looking through. Still, I think the goal was to turn off viewers from Bangkok.Some of the events in this film are disgusting, but certainly fitting. The strip club scene is very dirty, but very funny making even the dirtiest parts of The Hangover Part II, appealing. The scene that was probably the most offensive was the photo during the end credits that parodies one of the most famous photos of the Vietnam War that was taken in the Ho Chi Minh city. Most people probably won't get it, and while you think it was uncalled for, it's something you just really need to let go and forget. It isn't worth it.With so many watered down comedy films like Fired Up and even with R rated comedies that are questionable for that, The Hangover Part II stands out as a film takes its R rating and utilizes it to the rating's full capabilities. While there are many laughs, what it all boils down to is it is just a raunchier and not as fun sequel that takes everything that made the first film so enjoyable and suspenseful and just does it again. This time, we know every twist and turn and nothing is a surprise.Starring: Ed Helms, Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, and Justin Bartha. Directed by: Todd Phillips.",5,4,10,28 May 2011
Rudy," Not as accomplished as an underdog should be
","Rudy is a story of the underdog who rises from modest beginnings into a brave, admirable character. Its goal is to most likely motivate young teens in our character, Rudy's, position, or just serve as cleverly gift-wrapped optimism. It is what many of its kind are; light, cheery, and comprised of great, capable actors.Sean Astin plays Rudy Ruettiger, a teenager attending a heavily Catholic high school, with ambition to go to Notre Dame for college. Rudy is a great football player, despite his lack of physical proportions, but his grades are far from average, which serves as the reason for him not being able to get accepted.Nonetheless, he is determined, and vows to study hard at a junior college called Holy Cross. He also manages to score a part-time job working the groundskepper at Notre Dame for the football team, the Fighting Irish. There, he is guided by Fortune (Dutton), who serves as his motivation to keep the field clean but also to not give up on his dreams. All Rudy's life he has wanted to make a tackle or even just be on the field of a football game during gametime. The film shows how far he will go to obtain that dream.In terms of performances, the film is rather engaging. Sean Astin, once more, gives a wonderful performance, making this, again, another film I have seen by him where he is splendid and convincing. I have yet to see a bad film with him. Jon Favrea also does some fine work as Rudy's friend who agrees to help him with school if he can secure him a date for the school dance.The soundtrack, composed by legendary Jerry Goldsmith, is entrancing, especially during some of the climatic sequences. Goldsmith has composed roughly one-hundred film scores and still knows how to dodge cloying sentimentality, yet is aware on how to capitalize on a big moment.Director David Anspaugh and screenwriter Angelo Pizzo collaborated on the set of Hoosiers in their own positions, respectably, and seem to have found a way to make the genre of sports dramas function as best they can even though clichés monitor the area.So why is Rudy a 'good' film and not a great one? My main point of complaint is the ending. It feels naked and left me a tad underwhelmed. Mainly because the suspense and urgency was traded in to put emphasis on Rudy's actual dream. The nail-biting ending many sports films tend to have is that the game is on the line during the final minutes of the film. Not in Rudy's case. Its focus is something greater, but because so much was made about accomplishing Rudy's dream, I felt happy for him, but not extremely satisfied during the credits. Also, it is never truly explained how Rudy went on to pay for a college as expensive as Notre Dame's with a modest income from his family and himself.I felt more could've been done, suspense could've been created, and more emotion could've been erected. This is an inspiring film, but greatly inferior to a sports drama like Remember the Titans. One is greatly ambitious, willing to tackle many different fields in its genre. The other is a textbook drama, with poignantly satisfying moments, yet a lot of empty ones.Starring: Sean Astin, Jon Favrea, Ned Beatty, and Charles S. Dutton.

Avengers: Age of Ultron," Fizzles when it should pop
","The 'Avengers' films, and the films of Marvel in general, play less like films and more like large-scale business investments that need to churn an unfathomable amount of money (think north of $1.5 billion) to even be considered a success. When film becomes that expensive and driven by finances, to me, it's no longer an act of entertainment but an act of business and a potentially crippling investment. The Marvel brand, in general, while showing no signs of letting up at the box office, has made me weary over the last two years, as I've been straining to find a great deal of satisfaction in most of the two to three superhero films released every year. To call this genre much of a muchness is still shortchanging in how its repetition hurts the individual impact of each of these films for me.Joss Whedon's 'Avengers: Age of Ultron,' I thought, would be the exception; after disillusionment with 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier,' 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2,' and 'Iron Man 3,' I was hoping I'd emerge from the sequel gleaming with joy as I did with the first film. However, 'Age of Ultron' doesn't escape the same kind of issues the former films had; familiarity continues to breed contempt, repetitive quips and attempt at humor distract from core character relations, and candy-colored action that undermines the talent at hand.The film concerns the same Avengers team as last time: Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) all assemble once more to make up the beloved superhero team. However, this time, the team needs to find a way to assemble and be strong enough to take down Ultron (James Spader), an artificially intelligent villain who is created through technology to try and erase human extinction. Even with six of them, however, the Avengers find themselves still underpowered in the face of Ultron's immense technological presence. The film concerns their efforts to take down the villain, whilst coming to realize just what their lives and existence means for the face of humanity.The original 'Avengers' packed in some terrific character relations; it was fascinating to see how all these superheros would interact with one another, constantly trying to one up their peers and stand tall in the face of everything. 'Guardians of the Galaxy' worked to expand this feature in a sillier way, but still worked on the level of helping us relate to these larger than life figures. One scene in this film, I recall, has these characters interacting at leisure, and it takes place in a lavish penthouse after a party with all of the Avengers attempting to lift Thor's hammer. Whedon goes for the kill with this film, infusing a great deal of action sequences rather than focusing on the graceful character presence that made the first 'Avengers' so fun. In both that film and 'Guardians,' we felt like we were hanging out with these heroes; now, we're back to passively observing them at work.With that, it's amazing to see Whedon, who kept the humor in the first 'Avengers' to a minimum, only pulling it out on certain occasions, usually to great effect, rely so heavily on quips here. It seems nearly every scene has to end with some kind of forced jab or one-liner, especially a desperately unfunny recurring joke made by Captain America in the opening scene about the use of bad language. These kinds of things only distract from what Whedon does well, particularly here, where those things are masked by other, lesser features.For one, Whedon continues to prove, from both a screen writing and directorial standpoint, that he can juggle chaos. Whedon can habdle about five or six things going on in terms of tying them together when the time comes and capturing such chaos as it's unfolding before us. Sometimes, one needs to just sit back in pure awe at the camaraderie occurring before us and marvel at its visual coherency thanks to Whedon's careful hand. In addition, 'The Avengers' addresses the weaknesses of the team, despite having six superheros working together. The invincibility element of Marvel superheros has continuously been a distracting element for me, with each passing Marvel film, in that I rarely feel a sense of danger for these characters because it seems as if nothing can stop them.In 'Age of Ultron,' we actually see the Avengers struggle to adequately assemble to take down Ultron, even going as far as to vacationing to a resort in order to further strengthen and develop. This element of questioning just how strong these six heroes are is something that this extended universe needed.'Avengers: Age of Ultron,' especially for possibly setting forth new standards for blockbusters in terms of budget, gross, and scope, is still an underwhelming experience. For a film so grand in its vision and limitless with its roster, it feels so grounded in routine, Marvel formula, so much so that the end battle treads dangerously close to not only being boring but riddled with the same kind of 'Transformers'-esque excess that, again, could set a dangerous precedent. Whedon must be admired here, mainly for his craft at handling a great deal of things going on in unison along with his efforts to question the Avengers' invincibility, but considering this is time when the series should take off in the way of 'The Empire Strikes Back,' the fact that it wobbles and fizzles in impact is a tad frightening.",6,11,24,2 May 2015
Hotel Transylvania," We need to talk about boundaries...
","An animated film centered around a large group of monsters featuring the voice talents of the Happy Madison gang wasn't a premise that instantly triggered my interest, however, I'm reporting back with a great sense of relieved certainty. Hotel Transylvania is a fun, spontaneously enjoyable effort that is presented with wit and stylistic touches by the highly acclaimed director, Genndy Tartakovsky (whose credentials include the cherished Dexter's Laboratory and Star Wars: Clone Wars), and a storyline that is well-told and, thankfully, refuses to exploit its father-daughter relationship.This is the second animated film I have seen that was released in the year 2012 and also centers on the complex relationships had by parents and their daughters. The last effort I saw was Pixar's Brave, an unfairly bashed spectacle that beautifully articulated a confident heroine that knew what she wanted to become, refraining from an obligatory subplot about a character lacking in direction, but was met with conflicts from her domineering mother. Hotel Transylvania lacks the moral-heaviness and amplifies the situations and events in a more rambunctious way, yet still not forgetting the elephant in the room. It balances both of these things nicely, and will consistently find ways to delight the little ones and please the older ones.The plot: We are presented with Dracula (voiced by Adam Sandler), the owner and creator of Hotel Transylvania, an enormous castle that has the ability to house hundreds of monsters and keep them safe from the activity of dreaded humans. Dracula is a widow, who is taking precious care of his daughter, Mavis (Selena Gomez), who has just turned 118 years old and is young and ready to explore the world. Dracula, as one can expect, is heavy into the suturing aspect of parenting, putting fear and impossibly unrealistic notions of how unsafe and dreadfully scary the human-driven world is, and stages a setup for her to see this when she leaves the castle for the first time.He believes that after showing her 'the horrors' of the world, Mavis is at Hotel Transylvania for good. That is until Dracula decides to throw a party, inviting fellow monsters like Frankenstein (Kevin James), Murray the Mummy (Cee Lo Green), Wayne and Wanda Werewolf (Steve Buscemi and Molly Shannon), and Griffin the Invisible Man (David Spade), just when a naive young human named Jonathan (Andy Samberg) wanders onto the hotel's territory. Dracula makes every attempt possible to hide Jonathan from the monsters and vice-versa, to show that Hotel Transylvania is the human-free paradise it has been and always will be, but Jonathan soon finds himself romantically involved with Mavis, much to Dracula's dismay.There are two things that became more apparent to American audiences in 2012 when watching animated films, and those were the revival of nostalgic little things and relationships between parents and their children. Wreck-It Ralph introduced the younger generation to the beautiful machines that were arcades, inventing several new worlds and detailing them all exquisitely, while Hotel Transylvania attempts to further the 'kiddie horror movie' genre (which has been one of the most consistent genres in animation this year) by introducing them to the classic Universal monsters. It's nothing but apparent that the cast, which is mainly comprised of Adam Sandler's Happy Madison company, has a love and respect for the iconic horror figures that shaped the genre, and in ninety-two minutes they put a clever PG-rated spin that will delight many children and please genre-purists.Pixar's Brave should be one of the films that serves as a poster-child for parental-child disconnect, where an identity crisis wasn't apparent on the main character and neither was a sense of directionless. The main theme there was compromise between a girl's mother and the girl herself, so that she could pursue the life of freedom she always wanted without contention with her mother. Hotel Transylvania shows a father's protection that goes way past that idea to channel sheltered and anti-social behavior. His daughter just wants to see the world for herself and not be gridlocked to her father's nosy, impulsively petulant nature. What needs to result is something of a compromise, and perhaps parents will see their relationships with their own children in this film and, hopefully, make some fitting adjustments.Hotel Transylvania is beautifully animated (coming from Sony Pictures Animation, a company that still may have a long way to go before its name hits the majority of households), and occupies a fluency and style that Tartakovsky has made a name for over the years. The only thing I can see being bothersome for audiences, including myself, is the somewhat frantic pacing, which hits near-breakneck speeds in the first forty minutes, but comes to a pleasantly controlled nature for the remaining fifty. There seems to be so much detail, homage, and style in the picture that maintaining a frantic pace throughout the entire course of its runtime would've been lethal to its likability.Voiced by: Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg, Selena Gomez, Kevin James, Fran Drescher, Steve Buscemi, Molly Shannon, David Spade, and Cee Lo Green.

Big Fish," The tears are earned - not extracted
","At first glance, Big Fish seems like a Tim Burton film grounded in reality; a picture of his that finally abandons his unconditional love for fantasy in favor of a more realistic, recognizable world. However, the fantasy is even greater here, and only uses its reality and recognizable qualities as a backdrop for a moving, poetic parable on life itself in one of the grandest ways.Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is a middle-aged man who has long been in a strong relationship with his mother but not his father. His father has a way of attempting to generate connection and likability through stories that seem to only serve as charming, whimsical little tales to amuse a small child. When his father becomes bed-stricken, he desperately wants to know more about who he is. He is tired of having a father/son relationship solely built on what appears as a mutual understanding between two people that live in the same house.Of course his father, Edward Bloom (Albert Finney), gives the explanation the only way he can give it - through a larger than life story. In these flashbacks showing his young life he is played by Ewan McGregor, a perfect fit for the enigmatic Edward. These flashbacks detail persistency, young-love, passion, and several other themes and morals better than some films do on their own. Often, we'll pounce back into reality with Will taking care of his father or furthering an attempting at long overdue connection.I know I'm not the only soul who can relate to Big Fish's portrayal of father/son disconnect. Even as I continue to live with my father in my teen years, I can't help but think of him as someone I know very well rather than my all-powerful father. I love him, certainly, but our drastic difference put us at what I call a quandary that is unable to remedied. The film succeeds in showing that even if there's no spark between you and a parent, you're only given one set of biological parents and you should make an attempt at the strongest connection possible.Big Fish is visually marvelous and explicitly potent when it reaches the flashback sequences. Burton isn't as dark or as Gothic as he could be and simply enjoys emphasizing the unique, vibrant environments of each specific flashback. I feared early on that this film would be one I could only admire, as alienation began to sit in. And yet, Burton - a true cinematic auteur - doesn't keep viewers at arm's length with the material. He has his own tricks of pulling an audience-member into the film and it definitely shows here. I can't recall another film when I went from alienation to comfort so quickly.The concept of a father attempting to provide his son with insight and significance of his existence - and his ability to connect with others on a personal level - is not different from what renowned Swedish director Ingmar Bergman captured beautifully in his film Wild Strawberries. The story concerned a daughter, now well-grown and a functioning adult, attempting to get closer to her father who has always been able to generate smiles and charm from strangers but not close family. One strength it possessed over Big Fish was its lack of ambiguity and abstraction. Ultimately, these features give this film one of its greatest strengths and, simultaneously, one of its greatest weaknesses. The abstraction makes the film not open to one interpretation, but it also somewhat prevents strong connection with characters.Big Fish benefits from a strong sense of imagination and emotion, which comes through in the very wend. It's less surprising but very moving, and is captured in an unconventional way. It doesn't feel like tears are being extracted, but earned and deserved as the film doesn't play the game of emotional manipulation. Burton erects a nicely-articulated, magical wonderland with flowing music and limitless characters. Just in that respect the tears don't seem to be obligatory.Starring: Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Billy Crudup, and Jessica Lange. Directed by: Tim Burton.",8,0,0,7 May 2013
Major League," Doesn't strike out...yet
","Major League is not only a comedy film with numerous laughs, it proves itself to be one of the grand-daddies of baseball comedies. A League of Their Own and Bull Durham are also among the list although those are more towards the drama genre. I attend various minor league baseball games a year. Approximately twelve. I love them. Being a Chicagoan, I think I'd rather watch minor league teams than major league teams.Some may call that strange, but I love the entertainment and the 'close to home' feel provided by a minor league game. There are tons of events on the field to keep me interested, and I know pretty much every cop and concession stand employee there thanks to my father. It's an enjoyable time. I walk around most of the game, chat with various officers, it's a damn good time.On with the film. I can discuss Minors vs. Majors in a separate blog. After the Cleveland Indians' owner dies, her husband Rachel (Whitton) inherits the team. She plans to make the team as poor as possible so they can move the team to Miami. To put it simply, she sabotages the team, the stadium, and everything else in various ways to assure a poor season.The team is mainly made up of rookies like Willie 'Mays' Hayes (Snipes), Rick 'Wild Thing' Vaughn (Sheen), and Jake Taylor (Berenger). They're acceptable players, but no where near as good as they should be.One thing I really enjoyed and found worthwhile about Major League is the fact that we get closer into Jake Taylor's relationship life. It's good that all the fun doesn't take place on the field, and we get a wider variety and an in-depth look on one player's life. I would've liked to hear more about Lou Brown's (Gammon) career and more about some other players. But at least it's not all about on the field interactions.Charlie Sheen, James Gammon, and Wesley Snipes were all great in the film. It's a little sad that Gammon died this past July, and news about it really didn't surface too much. Not looking at Gammon's filmography, I assume his career wasn't made up of too many more famous roles like his portrayal of Lou Brown.Charlie Sheen was extremely hilarious in this film, but watching it only makes me more sad about he just continues to make an ass of himself to the media. His career is going straight into the ground as of now. In this film he was extremely handsome, but now his image makes him look older than he is, and his reputation is plummeting into the ground. Oh well, his role as Wild Thing was, say, WINNING.Wesley Snipes is fantastic in this as well playing Willy 'Mays' Hayes. He is absolutely funny, and a great addition to the cast. Too bad for him as well because since Snipes refuses to pay his taxes, he is in prison until 2013. I really enjoyed him in movies like Blade and Passenger 57.What truly scares me is that this film has spawned two sequels. This kind of film can only be done well once, passably a second time, and pretty much end horrifically with a third film. Back to the Minors could easily make or break the franchise. Why make a sequel when Berenger and Sheen don't even return? It's all about the benjamins.Major League can be summed up with a few statements. An enjoyable baseball comedy, a cast of greats, but a cast of people whose lives either ended tragically or just were forgotten.Starring: Tom Berenger, Charlie Sheen, Corbin Bernsen, Rene Russo, James Gammon, Margaret Whitton, and Wesley Snipes.

The Dark Knight," No pretty colors here
","The Dark Knight effortlessly manipulates and reworks the comic book movie formula and fearlessly extends the range of just how far it can actually go. Some settle for cutesy pulp, some go the extra mile and create a fun and somewhat enjoyable romp, some work truly hard at injecting the craft and substance needed in both the hero and the person, but The Dark Knight creates some of the most dramatic tension and visual craft in any movie seen in years.My original viewing of this film wasn't the best one. I found it to be a marginally decent film, with good action, but was saddened to see how drastically different Batman's style was changing. Here's a hero who got his start in comics, went on to do the cheesiest programs imaginable, (which I do really enjoy) and was forced into several films by Tim Burton, and that one mess everyone likes to forget by Joel Schumacher. To this day, I still can't truly explain why I wasn't wowed by it back then. Maybe I was just too hard-hearted, maybe I was paralyzed by the hype and stubbornly didn't want to conform myself to the love, or maybe I was just wrong.Now I see the picture for what it really is; an immensely satisfying film that pleases the most demanding Batman fan and will almost certainly please anybody just looking for an eventful, highly memorable two and a half hours. I will not explain and elaborate on the plot, as I want this review to be primarily centered on the film criticism aspect itself. I want to informatively dissect the film, rather than waste time reiterating a plot, most likely, everyone is familiar with.Right off the bat, the cinematography and look of Gotham City serves as a character in and of itself. I've heard some complain it's suffocating, but I say it evokes amazing craftsmanship. Even after a long 153 minutes, I wasn't wearying from its sight. It is so stunning, painstakingly detailed, and provides the film with the huge amount of style even the Batman comics were known for. It doesn't pull any punches or scapegoat on the look. It truly shows its artful side.Performance-wise, I must bring in unwanted dislike and say that I have never been a fan of Christian Bale as Batman. As Bruce Wayne, I feel he brings a sort of classiness and arrogance, not as sharp and as witty as Tony Stark (although not intended to be), to the screen, and he has proved himself worthy in thoughtful character studies. But when he puts that suit on, I am just not entirely convinced. The voice is the primary complaint, which seems a little overwrought and unnecessary.Still, his presence is not by any means unwanted or unwelcome. I just think as Batman he's not on-par with the elegance and style of the rest of the picture.Now let's talk about one of the decade's most surprisingly convincing and entertaining villains, The Joker, portrayed with sheer evilness and stride by Heath Ledger. No matter what Nolan chooses to do with the remainder of his Batman trilogy, or what he has done, the series will always be remembered by the posthumous Oscar win of Ledger. The kind of spirit and wonder that Ledger infects this villain with could very well be the best villain with no superpowers ever to be seen in a comic book movie. His psychological mind-games, his purely engaging tone of voice, and his humble yet present wit that carries throughout the entire picture.A remarkable thing that Nolan has done is not abuse or shorthand any part or component, despite having a grand ability to. The chockablock of A-list stars here is something not usually seen in a superhero film, so the standard had yet to be set, and even with the presence of Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Gary Oldman, and Aaron Eckhart, the film never becomes too reliant on one character. Not to mention, having such a unique and convention-defying villain like The Joker sets the benefit up to occupy too much screen time and too much of an ability to become tiresome. That never happens, because Nolan and writer, David S. Goyer know how to perfectly utilize this character, neither overusing or underusing him.One of the other minor complaints I have is just about the weight of the plot vs. the weight of the characters. The original Batman film in Nolan's trilogy, Batman Begins, a faithful, yet somewhat unsatisfying picture (keep in mind, I haven't seen it since 2005), explored touched upon the more human-side of Batman. It is rare we get a scene with Batman out of costume and it's rare one of those scenes becomes rather deep and involving. Some great dialog is exchanged between Eckhart's Harvey Dent, who does a phenomenal job as well, and The Joker, but again, never does the morality or depth of these characters truly come forth.The Dark Knight is a beautifully crafted picture, though one not without its petty imperfections. Nolan's has successfully made a writing and directorial achievement, giving the respected hero probably his best film to date. The fans have not been silent on that aspect.Starring: Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Morgan Freeman.

Friends with Benefits," Favorable, yet familiar
","Friends With Benefits, while good, serves as one of many 2011 sizable disappointments next to Bad Teacher. Maybe I don't like this type of cliché storytelling, but I think what is partially to blame is that the film is marketed like a laugh-out-loud comedy, when really, it's more or so made up of the occasional chuckle and the rom-com parody that is more clever than funny. Still, it is in no way bad, just misleading and expected.The big thing with this film that I found very smart and very effective is its cast. Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis are some of today's hottest celebrities. Timberlake is popular with the ladies, and Mila Kunis is popular with the men (I am no exception). Not to mention, we get cameos by Emma Stone and The Lonely Island's Andy Samberg. If this isn't an ensemble comedy cast, I don't know what is.Right off the bat, when thinking of this film, the film No Strings Attached comes to mind which came out earlier this year. I say big deal. If we can have multiple superhero films come out this year, each one dopier than the next, multiple comedies about grown men trying to have sex, and even CGI-ed Alvin in the Chipmunks, Garfield, and The Smurfs, I don't see why two films focusing on the same topic, asking the same question can't be made.The plot is as simple as it has ever been. Dylan (Timberlake) is an art director who works in Los Angeles. Jamie (Kunis) is an Executive Recruiter who tries to recruit Dylan for GQ Magazine. Both have been recently dumped, and miss sex, but don't feel the problems that follow sex are worth it. Dylan and Jamie meet, they become close, and they both agree they are emotionally complex in some way. So they decide to have casual sex, no feelings, nothing personal, just sex. They swear on the Bible - iPad that is.Dylan meets and befriends the sports writer for the magazine, Tommy (Harrelson) who is one of the funniest characters in the film. He gives Dylan advice like a straight man, when really he thinks a man and a woman together is 'creepy.' This film is funny, but not as funny as it suggests. It is better than No Strings Attached by a little. For one thing, it treats its characters like human beings and not just 'Man' and 'Woman.' Not to mention, Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis are clearly having fun with their characters.The humor, most of it coming from Kunis, comes natural and isn't forced. But I would've thought more laugh-out-loud moments came out of this picture. The trailer suggests this was nonstop comedy from two shining stars. I only recall laughing-out-loud twice in this film, and I dare not speak the scenes.Vulgarity in Friends With Benefits is one thing it does right. It has a lot of it, but enough of it. It isn't in every sentence, yet it isn't squeaky clean. Plus, it's always fun to see a couple having a serious conversation throwing in swear words like fourteen year olds.I liked Friends With Benefits, but I left disappointed. Maybe this formula is near-impossible to freshen up because of the inevitable outcome everyone sees coming from the moment they sit down in the theater. It's not a bad thing to be cliché, especially in a time like this where it's hard to avoid. It just doesn't work in the film's favor. There are scenes where the film tries to parody other rom-coms, and is successful at that. But what this boils down to is a good comedy, with a disappointing effect. It gets us where we need to be, but then says 'eee, uhh. I'm done.' Starring: Justin Timberlake, Mila Kunis, Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, Andy Samberg, and Richard Jenkins.

Annie Hall," Some experience required
","It is a common feature of myself to allow some films simmer after I watch them, meaning taking a significant amount of time before I sit down and begin to review them. Woody Allen's Annie Hall is definitely one of those films that needs to come to a full stop before I can fully analyze it. Getting up from it, I was convinced that I had seen something relating to the concept of 'art,' but couldn't quite magnify it in a reasonable context. I think I finally found the proper way.The plot is paper thin, with characters who make up the structure of the picture by their eclectic personalities. Woody Allen is Alvy Singer, a neurotic, self-loathing comedian always putting himself on the lower end of the pedestal. He meets Annie Hall (Keaton), a beautiful, refreshingly different woman, one who dreams of being a devout singer, who seems to be just what Alvy needs; an outgoing, adventurous, yet too somewhat neurotic, woman, fearlessly different and shamelessly content.Inevitably, Alvy's paranoia consumes him, and his angst towards people and society, which leads to a certain hesitation with dating Annie. She seems to be almost too good for Alvy in the respect that he is so jittery and paranoid, that she deserves better, and he deserves inferior. He explains that among other points through the film's most unique features. As a method to actually talk to the audience, Allen's character will provide narrations, give lengthy monologues to the camera, bravely breaking the fourth wall, showing us brilliantly crafted fantasies (one of the funniest takes place in a movie theater), and even giving us a well drawn animated sequence.One can see why the film bested Star Wars for the Best Picture win in 1977. The Academy always seeks out the most diversely original and esthetically different picture, and they always try and tactfully avoid giving out awards to a big budget blockbuster, much like how The Hurt Locker bested Cameron's Avatar in 2009.As a whole, Annie Hall is a delight, but I believe it's one of those films that will become better, at least for me, with age and personal experience. It seems that at this point in time, I haven't hit the proper notes to be able to personally connect with this film, in terms of being self-conscious in a relationship and constant fear of societal inferiority because of motifs. While I thoroughly enjoyed Annie Hall, and found the performances, writing, and direction and tone to be all of top notch and commendable status, the personal connection, which I believe the film depends rather heavily on, is unfortunately not present. I can see this being revisited optimistically in ten or so years with experience.Starring: Woody Allen and Diane Keaton. Directed by: Woody Allen.",9,1,2,3 June 2012
Green Street Hooligans," Unlike 'Fight Club,' it has one demand, not rule
","One of my favorite gang films of all time is Boyz N The Hood, mainly because its prime focus isn't the actual gang members but rather the people affected by the violence and unrest. The film followed three men, growing up with albatrosses and typical coming of age struggles, only magnified because of their presence in a poor neighborhood. The film was dark, poignant, and very, very upsetting, yet beautifully done, with every frame and character having paid close attention to detail and subtitles.Along comes Green Street Hooligans many years later. It's no Boyz N The Hood, but it's still worth a look. The film centers around the London 'Green Street Elite' (GSE) gang, comprised of brutal men with a die-hard obsession for the sport of football and an appetite for grave brutality. Their latest member is tourist Matt Buckner (Wood), who was kicked out of Harvard after being framed for drug use. He visits his sister and her husband out in London, and winds up becoming acquainted with her husband's brother Pete (Hunnam), the leader of the hooligan 'firm.' The transformation Matt undergoes from a decent, well-educated man to a thuggish, impulse-driven madman happens very quickly as he winds up favoring respect over modesty and violence over civil obedience.Elijah Wood seems to be holding up nicely after The Lord of the Rings trilogy, building a solid and diverse filmography, but here, he seems a bit outgunned. This is one of the things about independent films I grow weary about; some of the them feel the need to softly 'American-ize' their story by either adding a well-known actor or by hammering in homages from other common American films. Green Street Hooligans does both, but subtly enough so as not to be too distracting. While Wood feels out of place, he nonetheless does everything he can with his role, and the result is favorable. As for the slight homages, it seems the film has also had a little run-in with David Fincher's Fight Club in terms of some of the underground fight scenes.The fight scenes are brisk, attractive, if a little too much of a fantasy, but the most important thing to notice is how the GSE look at other gangs. Throughout the film, numerous dirty looks are exchanged, facial expressions seem to scream over words, and some scenes involving Elijah Wood, who arguably has the most difficult role in the picture, capture the fear and regret just by the simple look into ones eyes.Another thing to note is the impressive use of cinematography, which is superbly utilized in the scene where Matt is walking home alone through the cold streets of London. London's xenophobia is consuming, and so is the violence that one could find on the streets. The ominous, bleak texture of the city is wonderfully portrayed, and the film makes no attempt to try and gloss over the facts when it comes to street violence and how unapologetic it can become.Director Lexi Alexander, a world champion in both kickboxing and karate, has stated in interviews that her older brother was a member of a football firm and that she got a lot of inspiration from the encounters she had with the gang while with him. Her work is definitely well done and acted properly, but something feels missing. Thinking back to mobster films like Goodfellas and gang films like Boyz N The Hood, what made them so good was that the characters were like time-bombs, with explosive personalities rather than explosive actions, and were developed with plenty of care and attention. Green Street Hooligans sort of focuses too much on Matt and Pete, and forgets there are other members of the gang worth describing. This is a fine film, shedding light on a band of people I'm sure not many in the United States are aware about, but the lasting effect isn't too long and the result is a tad too Hollywood.Starring: Elijah Wood, Charlie Hunnam, Claire Forlani, and Leo Gregory.

2001: A Space Odyssey," A film that will grow with you
","2001: A Space Odyssey is a rare movie experience, one of mesmerizing visuals, meticulous craft, full of valuable interpretations, and a work to stand the test of time. Even as computer-generated imagery (CGI) has given animation, action films, and fantasy pictures an antiseptic sleekness and a practical way to showcase certain unforeseen sequences as if they could really happen, films like Star Trek: A Motion Picture, its corresponding TV series, and 2001: A Space Odyssey existed in a time where amateurish special effects where what was predominately available. Director Stanley Kubrick and the studio of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), however, found sources to provide beautiful and limitless cinematography and special effects work in order to bring space into theaters all over the world. This achievement alone is enough to warrant 2001's placement amongst some of the most important films of all time.That's just what 2001 is - one of the most significant films ever made. Its use of special effects is incredible, its themes ranging from existentialism to human and mankind's value in the face of excelling technology, its developed and authentic style showcasing space exploration, and its use of detailed visuals all make its placement on such a list a worthy one. Too many people get caught up in trying to find 'the best' films that they forget about the ones that made splashes, which circumvented into impacts, game-changers, and iconic works. 2001 is an iconic work from a director who, had he never touched cinema, may've set cinema back several years.The film is divided into four vignettes that detail man's interactions with advanced and incalculably valuable Monoliths, otherwise known as high-powered machines that do much of the thinking for humans when it comes to space travel and exploration. The first vignette concerns 'the dawn of man,' following ape-like beings trying to find food in a vast desert, the second concerns passengers aboard a Pan-AM space plane that learn of an epidemic occurring at one of the Lunar bases they're destined to come in contact with, the third and longest shows a group of scientists traveling aboard the spacecraft 'Discovery One,' joined by the advanced, supercomputer HAL 9000, a machine that should be helping them on their journey to Jupiter but instead seems to be hindering them, and the fourth concerns Jupiter and beyond.Each of these vignettes could easily spawn individual reviews, and because of that, it's difficult to look at 2001: A Space Odyssey as an entire project. In one-hundred and forty-eight minutes, the film manages to be often enthralling, wondrous, and on occasions, maddening, as some scenes shine and other scenes seem to drag. But all is well, as there is always something occurring in Kubrick's realm of directorial flair and Geoffrey Unsworth's unmatchable cinematography.With all the praise 2001's visuals have earned, it seems like nothing more than a waste of time to address them once again, but they must be. Unsworth's detail is simply exquisite, whether he is showing the vast openness and emptiness of space or he is showing the calculated quarters of these large and sometimes quite ominous spacecrafts. Pay attention to Kubrick and Unsworth's use of the color red, as it often is used to denote fear, vulnerability, and uncertainty. In addition, consider some of the unique and trickier visual sequences, such as the famous Star-Gate scene, where thousands and thousands of colors hit the screen at once, causing a mass amount of pressure and unbelievable visual annihilation on ones retinas. The scene was accomplished thanks to slit-scan photography, which is where a slide that has been slit is inserted between the camera and the camera's subject, resulting in a disorienting but indescribably beautiful and unique work of art.Because of 2001's plethora of visual techniques, along with its lengthy runtime, there's a lot to see but also a lot of detail to miss in terms of sights and themes. With this being my first viewing, I was astounded by how useless and void of significance the human characters are in this film. They essentially have no value outside of being devices for which the Monoliths and the technology work off of. This is quite the bleak future Kubrick and co-writer Arthur C. Clarke.2001: A Space Odyssey works the best when there is no dialog or character interaction and we're left to focus on a spacecraft drifting in the cold loneliness of space or we're watching the stars sit amongst the darkness. This is cinema at its most meditative and beautiful, especially with the wonderful score that chimes in at just the right times. The film goes down in my book for one of the best uses of a particular piece of music, in this case, the film's frequent use of 'The Blue Danube.' There's so much in 2001: A Space Odyssey, between its visuals, its score, its themes, and its commentary, that it easily warrants more viewings, which I plan to get on in the future. This is the kind of film I can see doing different things for me at different points in my life. Perhaps a second viewing will assure its themes, which I'm still trying to grasp and understand, become more vivid and clearer, where maybe a viewing when I'm an adult affirms realities about the world around us. I'm optimistic for the film to progressively get more insightful and more enriching as time goes on; that's one thing many modern, big-budget films boasting grandiose visuals and effects have a difficult time with.Starring: Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, William Sylvester, and Douglas Rain.

Toy Story," Go above and beyond and you achieve greatness
","Toy Story was the first entirely computer animated film in its time of release in 1995, and it puts Pixar on the map for a generation of amazingly crafted films to be made. The attention to detail is exquisite in this picture as reflections, flexibilities, and movement are all captured in such a stunning format it's almost too much to comprehend. Everything moves so fluently, is crafted with such a broad mind it's still astonishing to this date.CGI animation is made with wondrous creativity and the possibilities to show off it's style are virtually unlimited. Though when companies in 2011 make kids movies like these they forget about the storyline and just make the film loud and colorful to attract the youth's attention. Not Pixar. Pixar is so much smarter. They understand good animation and a great storyline with characters. Show me a Pixar movie that isn't at least above average and I'll show you a car that can you can drive with no wheels.But CGI animation has it's downsides. Being released in 1995, Toy Story was the first computer animated film. Meaning other companies were racing their technology where everyone wanted to take advantage of the CGI craze. The main company in this heated competition was DreamWorks Animation Studios. Their first feature film was Antz, notable for being almost a direct knockoff of Pixar's A Bug's Life which came out the same year (1998). Following Antz came others like Chicken Run and The Road to El Dorado. Still none of which lived up to Toy Story's caliber.DreamWorks scored big when releasing Shrek in 2001. It definitely put them on the map of animation companies, and it's surely remembered more than Chicken Run. But still, while Shrek had a more rapid fire sequel release schedule than Toy Story, none of which had the same heart, message, or love any of these films had.One last downside is that CGI, no matter which way you look at it, killed hand drawn animation. Generations of kids now likely will never get to experience the classic animation like they should. If they do they will most likely hate it after being exposed to all the glossy and more stylish animation that is among us today. But shows like Beavis and Butthead and The Simpsons are just as good.Enough with the animation history, lets talk about the film. I doubt anyone will disagree with me, that this is one of the greatest animated films of all time. It combines clever antics with loving characters you become attached to. It's funny to think toys have a mind of their own. Plus all the trouble they would experience if they were alive.Andy (Morris) is a typical child. He has a number of toys of different varieties and enjoys making up little adventures the figures can go on. All ranging from a Mr. Potato Head, a cowboy doll, a toy piggy bank, and others. Woody (Hanks), a cowboy doll, who now feels threatened when a flashy, gadget filled toy named Buzz Lightyear (Allen) is given to Andy for his birthday. Buzz impresses the entire gang of toys much to the dismay and fear of Woody that he will become another forgotten toy.Simple premise. Giant execution. It's everything and more. In the nineties, this animation was simply groundbreaking. Because this was the first film made by Pixar, the standard hadn't been set yet. But it was clear after Toy Story that animation would be forever changed for more than one reason.Starring: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Jim Varney, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, Annie Potts, John Morris, Laurie Metcalf, and Erik von Detten.

The Graduate," A remarkable film that shows teenage sensibilities, subtle aesthetic attributes, wickedly-funny humor, and deeply-contemplative drama
","It is not uncommon for an adolescent male to be attracted to an older, more mature woman, potentially as old, or even older, than his own mother. While there's the obvious, sexual attraction that is shown in film in a much more juvenile sense, there's also the undermined reason of being attracted to an older woman because of her charm, her wisdom, and her maturity, as well as her experience and refined sensibilities, like the personification of an aged wine. It is, however, quite uncommon for an adolescent male to have a relationship with an older woman and fall into the line of events similar to those in Mike Nichols' The Graduate, a wickedly funny film with serious dramatic undertones, beautifully underplayed subtleties, and some truly contemplative insights inside the rigorous and constantly-moving mind of a teenage boy. Dustin Hoffman assumes the role of twenty-year-old Benjamin Braddock, who has just graduated college a confused and uncertain soul. We can see just by the way he walks around his own graduation party that he is neurotic and uncomfortable, only moreso when he runs into Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), the attractive wife of his dad's business partner, who invites herself into his bedroom and requests a ride home. When they finally arrive at Mrs. Robinson's lavish home, Benjamin is immediately pampered with music and a glass of bourbon by a heavily-seductive and clearly aroused Mrs. Robinson, who requests that Benjamin sleep with her and stick around before the return of her husband.Benjamin is made only more uncomfortable by this madness, and after refusing numerous times to this offer, Mrs. Robinson states that she'd like him to visit whenever he is lonely or bored. Eventually, Benjamin takes up that offer, several times managing to sleep with her and making it a constant passtime. Mrs. Robinson, however, is a fragile soul, once an alcoholic and now mercifully protective of her daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross), who is Benjamin's age. Push comes to shove when Benjamin's parents, disillusioned that he's taking it too easy after graduation and not even thinking about career plans or graduate school, set him up on a date with Elaine, who he comes to fall in love with, much to the disgust of Mrs. Robinson. Now, Benjamin must juggle a jealous and unstable Mrs. Robinson, a wonderful but ignorant Elaine, and his own potentially unstable self.Nichols' Graduate is a masterclass of subtle filmmaking, with editing, shot structure, and little serene moments inside the film that give it all the character it needs. For example, there's the iconic shot where Nichols' camera is positioned underneath the arc of Mrs. Robinson's outstretched leg, showing a nervous but chummy Benjamin when he'd utter the now famous line of, 'Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me. Aren't you?,' nicely portraying lust, anxiety, and ruthless temptation.Continuing on, there's also the cold, frigid stare of Mrs. Robinson's Nichols chooses to close the scene just before Benjamin and Elaine venture out on their date. Rarely does a stare or a facial expression stay so much, and Bancroft, who is forced to have to go from sexy, to sexually adventurous, to angry, to passive-aggressive so quickly, nails this look perfectly in a scene that illustrates disgust, disappointment, neglect, and jealousy tremendously.The list goes on with the minor things The Graduate does right, but what it does is give us an entertaining story that miraculously avoids the shortcomings and pitfalls of a daytime soap-opera thanks to its acting and its narrative layers. This is a film that nicely, if unconventionally, details the tumultuous life of a teenager. Speaking as one myself at this moment in time, there are numerous forces that are poking and prodding us at all times, be them academic, parental, authoritative, seductive, temptation, whatever. Because of this, and of our inherent naivete and inexperienced nature, it's so easy for us to make a misstep and 'choose incorrectly,' causing a whirlwind of things to spiral out of control and into a pit of despair. While there is definitely debate to the conscious, decision-making, and even mental-state of our lead character Benjamin, The Graduate is effective at showing how a man's poor decision-making can have dire consequences on many, even if he never meant it in the first place. Theoretically, Nichols and writers Calder Willingham and Buck Henry could've chosen practically anyone - a forty-year-old man, a business executive, a woman, etc - but instead he chooses on a young man, new to the realms of adulthood and burdened by insecurity, neurotic tendencies, and the loud voices of many forces.It's truly amazing how The Graduate has gone on to still secure a rather solid reputation in the present, given its admittedly silly and often goofy nature. Yet, as Monte Hellman stated when discussing his film Two-Lane Blacktop, two films in the sixties had a hand in shaping the student/teenager culture and they were The Graduate and Easy Rider. Both films, he states, prompted reactions and unforeseen perspectives on their audiences, as well as providing people, mainly square adults who still carried the still carried the fifties sensibilities of commonality and cheesy togetherness, that teenagers indeed have darker, rebellious, and sexual feelings they need to express and The Graduate is a film that does that, even with its over-the-top nature and sometimes artificial 'sixties proper' dialog.The final thing to comment on with the film is the ending, which is handled splendidly, much like the rest of the picture. Without spoiling it, for the few people that seriously need to get going and watch this picture, it excellently communicates a 'now what?' idea, with two characters whose smiles fade, return, then fade again as they realize they spent the last several days wanting something. Now they have it; there's nothing left to want. Time to lead the boring life of their square parents, it seems.",10,0,0,6 April 2014
Singin' in the Rain," What else can it do but make you laugh?
","I have a nudging feeling that Singin' in the Rain has gotten the reputation of being overly-corny and shamelessly frothy with age and those accusations have unfortunately lessened the impact of the picture. The film is very obvious in its emotions and obnoxiously sunny in its disposition and tone (don't consider these flaws or criticisms), but it's also a picture to laud for the professionalism of its cast and the inanely addicting melodies of its song and dance numbers.The film concerns Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly), a popular and egotistical silent film star who is now feeling the switch from silent film to 'talkies,' films that have actual sound. Lockword often works with his cheery and humorous friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) as well as the shallow and often incorrigible Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) in his films. After the success of 1927's The Jazz Singer (the first film with sound), Lockwood and Lamont's next picture, titled 'The Dueling Cavalier,' is now a talkie but will need to overcome challenges. The most prominent challenge is Lamont's high-pitched, nearly-insufferable singing voice. Meanwhile, Lockwood meets Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds), an attractive and ambitious young actress. At first, they find each other to be irritating in their own ways. But Lockwood must learn to work with Kathy, once the crew discovers her presence may be necessary for the success of the project.Such song and dance numbers from Singin' in the Rain need to be experienced and can't be done justice in a conversation or an analysis. If you've seen the film, would you rather discuss the hilarity of Cosmo's 'Make 'Em Laugh' number, involving the character zealously prancing around a stage, doing flips and crazy dances while singing perfectly on key, or view it for the umpteenth time? Would you rather analyze Don Lockwood's titular song and dance (while battling a high-fever and a bad cold), or would you rather see it again and maybe wonder how Kelly performed so well when he was so ill? Musicals are a challenge to review because no matter what words you use to describe it or how you about analyzing the picture and its musical numbers, you simply don't feel like you're doing justice to its quality. I often laud musicals very heavily on atmosphere, sets, and acting, and all of those features are unsurprisingly top-notch here. The element likely to be neglected here is the acting, as Singin' in the Rain feature many talented people performing in a way few could. Such performers needed to be of a certain quality and such actors needed to be up to the challenge of performing a dance with such militaristic precision and rigor.To me, that's why Singin' in the Rain is the masterpiece that it is. The sets can only hurt your eyes with color for so long. The songs can only be fun to hum and sing for so long (I confess - I've been singing 'Moses Supposes' for two weeks straight now and feel it ranks as one of the best songs ever in any musical that I have yet to see for its difficulty in pitch and tongue-twisting lyrics). What Singin' in the Rain has that secures its long term success is its outstanding cast of performers that, from the start, are committed to delivering material with such memorable, complex force. Never have I seen a musical so assisted and made successful based solely on the talent of its actors.Starring: Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, Jean Hagen, and Donald O'Connor.

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," An experience for the spirit and the soul
","Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind's mystifying and sometimes downright confusing premise, due to the fact that it transcends reality and largely exists in the mind of a man, who is actively pursuing his unconscious to preserve dreams and memories, is levied by how incredibly honest its emotions and romantic notions can get at times. Even in its darkest, saddest moments, this is a thoroughly beautiful film, emotionally potent all around, exacting every emotion your system can handle almost with complete impunity to your senses. It's an uncommon film that, even when it's perplexing, still makes you grateful you're not watching a basic, linear romance drama.The film opens with Joel Barrish (Jim Carrey), a disconnected and unhappy soul, who impulsively ditches work one day and meets Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) on a train. Clementine is the exact opposite of Joel, free-spirited and frequently spacey, unfazed by a great deal of contrivances many get hung up on in their lives. We see their relationship span the course of two years before it ends in a fairly ugly fight, with Joel utterly baffled that one day, when he goes to meet and make up with Clementine, she has no recollection of who he is. Clementine had hired the services employed by a company called Lacuna, Inc., a corporation that specialized in erasing the memories of someone or something by completely white-washing the brain and making the subject forget any and everything related to said person or event.When Joel discovers this, he is loaded with questions that bear confidential answers; Clementine doesn't remember him and that's killing him, for he has no idea as to what her motivations or present feelings were. He has no other ideas besides to effectively wipe his own memory, reaching out to neurologist Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) to take advantage of his services. The memory-erasing crew consists of Stan (Mark Ruffalo), Patrick (Elijah Wood), and Mary (Kirsten Dunst), all of whom are taking care of Joel during his operation and bearing their own individual secrets attached to the project that come to light during the operation. It isn't until halfway through the operation, as Joel is having more-or-less an out of body experience, seeing Clementine disappear from his memories as he relives every moment he ever spent with her, that he realizes he doesn't want to go through with the operation. Within every memory, Joel tries as hard as he can to preserve Clementine's presence, even if that means taking him to some unknown part of his unconscious or into a memory where she was never personally present.Writer Charlie Kaufman creates a story so grounded in fantasy, yet simultaneously so devoted to showing it in a realistic manner, that the balancing act the film manages to pull off is quite remarkable to say the least. If minds could be erased and people, events, or traumatic experiences could be wiped away from our collective conscious and unconscious, then the methods would likely look a lot like how they're portrayed in Eternal Sunshine. Consider the visual scheme employed by cinematographer Ellen Kuras, a frequent collaborator of not only director Michael Gondry but Spike Lee, which emphasizes dreamlike beauty and subtle color schemes. Look at the way Clementine's hair changes color with her mood; when she's frightened and vulnerable, her hair is blue, and when she is content and so happy she could die, her hair is a light, relaxing shade of lime green. On top of that, the visual scheme employed in the sequences involving the past memories both Joel and Clementine experienced are almost soothing in the way they are captured and lit, evoking a rare sense of romanticized innocence.Eternal Sunshine's biggest issue, however, is its organization, which never allows us to get too comfortable or too immersed into any particular situation. I would've loved an entire film set inside the mind of Joel as it's being wiped free of anything related to Clementine, but Kaufman's distractions, in the form of the memory-erasers and their stories, provide for an annoying disruption to the intimacy and emotional resonance that takes so long to build from Joel and Clementine. By the time the film has that and has us totally wrapped up in these characters, it jumps back and forth between those actively erasing Joel's memory and the mind being erased, burdening an already difficult film to follow with more excess.Nonetheless, there's a beauty in the natural flow of emotions, and the simultaneous romance and sadness elements Kaufman employs here. It's difficult to make one feel touched and consumed by the love of a film's characters, yet sad and glum about the inevitable results of their actions and the happenings on screen, but Kaufman remarkably does it. The emotional roller-coaster Eternal Sunshine takes you on, never allowing you to cling to one emotion for too long, is remarkable from a screen writing standpoint, and a true work of beauty that needs to be cherished. Throw in strong central performances, particularly from Carrey, who handles the role of melancholy and lovestruck well, intertwining them with a sense of rare symmetry, and you have a pleasantly complex film that caters to the spirit and the soul.Starring: Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, Tom Wilkinson, and David Cross.

Taken," Get this man some Icy-Hot and a cold one
","'I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you're looking for a ransom, I can tell you, I don't have any money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills acquired over a very long career in the shadows, skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that will be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you. And I will kill you.' - Liam Neeson, Taken.From that quote, you can see what Taken is. A fast-paced action thriller with some of the most obvious lines in the history of the genre. The entire experience is lightweight and mildly amusing. Its plot is pretty ordinary, yet the film's characters are mostly efficient. It centers around Liam Neeson's Bryan Mills, a semi-retired CIA operative who worked in the field for many years which has led him to be aware, overprotective, and almost constantly paranoid.Victim to his protectiveness is his daughter, Kim (Grace). Kim is Bryan's daughter from his first marriage that didn't go so well because of his frequent absence since his CIA job is very demanding. Kim is a bright young girl who begs daddy for his signature so she can go to Paris with her girlfriend to look at the museums, aka U2 concerts. Reluctantly and after providing a plethora of conditions, Bryan signs the agreement and Kim is off to Paris. It's not long her and her friend are kidnapped by a group of Albanian thugs.Before she is taken, she calls her father who hears just enough information to make the effortless flight over to Paris and to try and find her kidnappers. Of course, Bryan possesses an unprecedented amount of skills to conduct an operation of this magnitude. For God's sake get this man a compass, a map, and a ticket to Afghanistan so he can find Osama Bin Laden and take down another terrorist operation! The first half hour of the film was compelling, interesting, and on top of everything an action film should be on top of; character development, plot, and suspense. After about forty-five minutes or so, Taken then becomes a slightly incomprehensible beat-em-up action film for the least demanding. The camera moves quickly and the fast paced editing style seems like it can sometimes barely keep up with the madness that's unfolding.Ultimately, the film is somewhat interesting, but how it merited a PG-13 rating is mind-boggling to me. It's not graphic, per se, but the MPAA is notorious for overreacting to small little instances and subject matter. The fact that this film can speak about drug addiction, prostitution, trafficking, and boast the amount of language and violence as if it comes in a limitless quantity, all with a PG-13 rating further cements that if a film focuses primarily on violence, the MPAA will continue to be very lenient on it.Something also must be said about Liam Neeson's performance. He possesses wit, style, pleasantness, stress, and anger all in a believable manner. The film is essentially a one man show with Neeson bringing as much life to the character, going beyond what has already been provided. The rest of the supporting cast is either rarely seen or killed off shortly after they make an appearance.Taken is a fair action film, motivated by the recurring action film themes; fast paced, sometimes unbelievable blows to every part of the body and nonstop twists and turns of the camera. Neeson manages to lift the film off its feet in terms of giving an efficient performance, but the film feels generic and suffers from the sameness we are so used to in action films today. It's not bad but its aftertaste is an underwhelming one at best.Starring: Liam Neeson, Maggie Grace, Leland Orser, Jon Gries, David Warshofsky, Katie Cassidy, Holly Valance, and Famke Janssen.

Alice in Wonderland," A Journey Into Burton's Wonderland
","'Excessive CGI is excessive. Well done excessive CGI is fluent and adds to the film.' - Steve Pulaski.Rating: 3/4 stars.Burton showed me a lot when I was younger. He showed me creativity, mystical worlds, creepy characters, eerie settings, and beautiful artistic films. I loved them when I was a kid. As Alice in Wonderland, I wasn't going crazy over the film. When it came time for it to come out, truthfully, I almost forgot. I had no interest in really seeing the film not being a hardcore fan of the original 1951 Disney movie of book. The film is just what I thought, not to bad, but not Burton's best at all. Its a passable film, but with its big potential behind it and fans all anxious to see it, it should have been a whole lot better.Before I discuss the flaws, lets discuss the film. Protagonist Alice is at a party, which is later revealed to be an engagement party for her to wed Hamish Ascot. A rabbit who disappears and reappears constantly baffles Alice. When following the creature down the rabbit hole, she once again falls into the Underland. After being confused by numerous tricks once entering the Underworld, Alice meats Dweedle Dee and Dweedle Dumb, The Chessire Cat, the famous Mad Hatter, and other famous characters from the book. Thats about the extent of the movie.The movie isn't awful by any means, but a lot of things could be improved. First off, the Mad Hatter seems like it took a lot of change in design before getting him to perfection. Thats fine, but it makes it look like all the other characters were rushed and not as magnificent or mastered as they could've been. Johnny Depp's performance as The Mad Hatter was very memorable and definitely the best I have seen this year next to Leo in Shutter Island. Though, let me tell you. He would surpass the 1950s detective if the movie he was in would have lived up.Might I also mention that the movie felt like it was given a time limit before filming even started? It looks like they gave Burton the 100 minute deadline along with the sentence 'You guys need to put this anticipated masterpiece into a film no longer then 100 minutes.' The film feels very compressed with time and definitely could have been about forty-five minutes longer to show more impressive scenery. The CGI is excessive, but tolerable and fitting for this occasion. Which brings my all new saying 'Excessive CGI is excessive. Well done excessive CGI is fluent and adds to the film.' Last but not least I will say the performances are beautifully done and done with talent and effort. Matt Lucas, Anne Hathaway, and Johnny Depp give it their all not to mention Masik Wasikowaska as the lead role of Alice.Alice in Wonderland is a dark sequel that is not the worst to come out of Burton. Though Edward Scissorhands and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory shockingly over-shadow this picture. I liked the movie to a certain extent, though I will look back on this film as a distant memory from my childhood, or quite possibly just an over-hyped film that just keeps delaying Tim Burton from releasing Frankenweenie.Starring: Mia Wasikowska, Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway, Crispin Glover, Michael Sheen, and Stephen Fry.

Avatar," Seek a world of CGI and blue and you'll be blown away
","Avatar is polarizing with its effects, but ordinary with its storytelling and plot. It shows off explicitly impressive graphics and exquisite acting, but still, when discussing plot elements, you'd like to say the film does something bigger and badder to commemorate the hype. Sadly, it gives us traditional storyline - one of the few letdowns of the film.But I'm making it sound like I didn't enjoy this one bit. Avatar is a beautifully made, work of film art in the sense of almost every medium it utilizes. Including the obligatory 3D, which is used surprisingly more as a visual enhancer than a gimmick.It's the year 2154, a handicapped man named Jake Sully is sent to an RDA corporation in replace of his brother who had recently passed away. Unlike his brother, Jake has basically no idea of what to do or what to expect during the project. The main objective is to create avatars the humans control to explore the world of Pandora. Pandora is populated by a paleolithic form of blue skin creatures, taller than humans, and resembling a feline form. The texture and detail in the creatures is spectacular and a true visual work of art.That's all I want to give away, and even with that it looks as if I've said too much. Avatar develops the love story like we'd expect, but even in its cliché state it feels Cameron did all he could to prevent the predictable turnout. Still, it's not that the story is completely intolerable.The effects, like you'd expect, consume the entire extravaganza. To begin with, Cameron is known for his revolutionary filmmaking, expensive budgets, and big name actors. Avatar is no exception to any of those rules. The film has a unique look to it in more ways than one. But in the effect field, it shines vibrantly. It's a technical breakthrough, possible paving the way for a new generation of movies to follow and live up to.I think what I enjoyed the most from Avatar is its constant action. The film's plot isn't thick, but it seems to have so much happening, so much going on, and so much unfolding it's almost impossible to look away. That's one of the highest compliments of any film; the fact that it is never a bore to watch. It's consistently entertaining and achieves an extremely difficult greatness.Avatar is more a breakthrough than anything. It is an imaginative work of art in every field but the storytelling. There's going to be three categories of fans for this film; people that love the film and everything about it, people, like me, who are pleased but not blown away by the turnout, and the people that show their inner cynic and hate the film and everyone who loves it. I will say the film doesn't force you to like it. If it did, we wouldn't have that third category.Starring: Sam Worthington, Zoë Saldaña, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez, and Giovanni Ribisi. Directed by: James Cameron.",9,3,6,18 December 2011
Frank," A film that should be character-centered, but gets by on true moments of companionship and emotions
","Lenny Abrahamson's Frank concerns Jon (Domhnall Gleeson), an aspiring singer-songwriter who has a head full of ideas but no conception of how to execute them. One day, he witnesses a man trying to drown himself at a beach before being rushed to the hospital. Jon is informed by Don (Scoot McNairy) that the man was a keyboardist for an experimental, new-age band by the name of The Soronprbs, which he manages. Learning that Jon plays keyboards, Don signs him to perform for the band one night, much to the dismay of everyone in the band except for the band's leader, a mysterious, enigmatic soul who wears an oversized, paper-mâché detailed to look like a cartoonish face and goes by 'Frank' (Michael Fassbender). When Frank signs Jon to be a full-time band member, Jon becomes the bane of Clara's (Maggie Gyllenhaal) existence, as she, the band's theremin-player, becomes increasingly jealous of the relationship that Frank and Jon have with one another.Jon sees Frank in a different light than everyone else. Rather than viewing him as some larger-than-life figure, he sees past his large mask and tries to cut into him deep as a person. Clearly, Frank has unresolved and deep-rooted mental issues, and the members of The Soronprbs often tell Jon in private to recognize these and go along with his behavior naturally. Jon, however, needs no schooling in how to handle Frank; there's an instant connection between the two and it's one that Clara or anyone else in the band couldn't provide him, which is undoubtedly what Frank saw the second he met Jon.There's a wonderful theme of companionship and connection rooted in Jon Ronson and Peter Straughan's screenplay, and it's not one rooted in fabricated answers or cheap, gift-wrapped justifications. It's a connection that exists and simply is, withstanding clear differences and wavelengths in the best possible way. Part of Frank's success is the way Fassbender portrays his character, in a way that shows he's a man of actions and feelings.Frank's biggest issue, however, is the way Ronson and Straughan write the film's characters. Undoubtedly, Frank is the most intriguing person in the film for more reasons than just his large, unique skull, but this is only more apparent when the supporting characters are just not written as eloquently or as interestingly as the titular one. The remaining characters in the film, and even their performances to some degree, carry a weighty coldness in a manner that makes it difficult to understand the motivations of the characters and, in turn, side with them. The film itself doesn't lack personality, but its characters leave a lot more to be desired than what we expect, given the film has such an intriguing premise.Abrahamson has made a film that is contemplative in themes and focus, but not one that looks at character enough. It mistakes moments of silence and long, awkward pauses between sentences as contemplative drama, when Frank is a film that should have character-centeredness written all over it. However, despite all this, the film manages to have real moments of emotional honesty and remains an enjoyable film on the basis it takes a quirky, and somewhat subversive idea, and runs with it to the point where something, be it strange emotions or even mixed ones, resonates.Starring: Michael Fassbender, Domhnall Gleeson, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Scoot McNairy.

Drag Me to Hell," Drag Me to Hell and Don't Show Me This
","If there was an Academy Award for 'Worst movie with a plot that could be resolved in thirty minutes or less', Drag Me to Hell would take the cake and eat it all. Sam Raimi returns after his successful 'Spider Man' franchise and returns to the 'Evil Dead' nostalgia he left us off with in 1987 bring us 'Drag Me to Hell'.Let me first note this is not a Horror movie, hardly a suspense movie. Lets just call it a 'Wanna be movie'.The plot revolves around Christine Brown (Allison Lohman) lives a normal life in present day Los Angeles working as a bank loan officer. After losing a promotion to her co-worker Stu (Reggie Lee), her boss tells her to become more strict of a loan officer and try to be more assertive and in control.One day, an elderly gypsy woman by the name of Sylvia Ganush (Lorna Raver) walks up to Christine and asks her for a third extension on her overdue mortgage payment. Christine denies her the mortgage to seem more assertive and to prove to Mr. Jacks she has what it takes for the promotion, apologizing to her and saying there is nothing she can do. Ganush becomes angry at her and attacks Christine. She is taken out by guards a few moments later.Fretting the issue, Christine gets into her car at the end of the day and is attacked by Ganush (which is very similar to the attack sequence in P2) who then puts a curse on her that she will be sentenced to Hell in three days.After confronting her boyfriend (Justin Long), she then seeks help Rham Jas (Dileep Rao), a fortune teller who tells Christine she will be going to Hell in a matter of three days. He convinces her to make an animal sacrifice, to which then she kills her cat.I shall admit this is the first movie I have walked out on in seven years (The Master of Disguise in 2002). It was not scary, a waste of my time, and after she killed the cat, I knew I was done.I have never been a fan of Raimi's films, I will have to admit I never liked them. After seeing this, I'm guessing Raimi's 'Spider Man 4' will be a little darker with satire seeing as in this film it's one of the darkest things he has done.I should also mention this movie experiments a lot with effects. It uses including green screen, puppets, prosthetics and computer-generated imagery throughout. That's probably the only highlight since this movie wasn't at all scary.The scene were she kills her cat was completely unnecessary, I found it saddening and just a ruin to what could have been a 'decent' (and I use that term lightly) movie. Especially seeing as the Horror in this movie is very limited. The awkward silence scenes are screaming JUMP SCENE at you hoping you will jump. This movie tries to be something it will never be, scary.Starring: Allison Lohman, Justin Long, Lorna Raver, and Dileep Rao. Directed by Sam Raimi.",3,0,2,4 July 2010
The Artist," Vibrant even though colorless
","What could've derailed into a drab and dry spectacle, perfectly executes everything it tries to accomplish in a serious and fun way. The Artist is an amazing homage to the classic silent films from the twenties and thirties, respectively. They are some of the simplest films, but pack so much in their context it's easy to miss a few beats.The idea of silent cinema is sketchy in 2011, but thankfully, The Artist never tries to present itself as a tongue in cheek parody or a goofy tribute. It is serious in its presentation and wants nothing more than to show that captivating cinema still exists and can work work wonders if done properly. Maybe it's because I have shot two silent films in the last year and am sympathetic to all the effort it takes to actually create one.The silent films I shot were for a Television class I took last year. They are nothing special and are pretty cheaply made. I loosely based it off a situation that really happened to my friend and I, and added a nice KISS song and threw in a few plot twists. It wasn't in black and white, and the editing wasn't this tight. I am open to the idea of more now that I have been schooled watching The Artist.Being that Jean Dujardin is a gifted physical actor and his appearance mirrors a real-life actor from the silent era only adds to the many reasons why The Artist succeeds on so many levels. He plays George Valentin, a silent film actor who has starred in many films over the course of the twenties with his scene stealing Jack Russell Terrier. Sadly, it's now 1927 and the silent film studios are suffering because a new fad of films that include sound, called Talkies, are the big thing.One day when George is being swarmed by the paparazzi, a woman gets pushed into him by accident. Instead of acting infuriated, which I can see many celebrities being now, he embraces the abrupt entry of the woman and poses for several pictures with her. The woman is then discovered to be Peppy Miller, played by the engaging and utterly beautiful Bérénice Bejo. George is so wooed by Miller's attitude and beauty that he auditions her for a role in his new film. After that, Peppy becomes more and more famous through roles of all different sizes in Talkies.Keep in mind, all this action, excitement, and suspense is captured through black and white film, many musical numbers, and a lens not in the typical widescreen format. Though the film is so engaging, I did not forget its silent nature but I do believe it is possible to forget the film lacks in dialog. Some very impressed moviegoers will be lost in the film's story and might be in for a rude awakening before the credits roll.The Artist is an enriching and delightful movie experience. Some will grow tired of the aspect but I can see many embracing it and craving more. The film has enough well-delivered action to not be called 'one note,' and enough clever plot points to prevent the word 'monotony' from coming in. It's subtle in its presence but massively entertaining in its delivery.Starring: Jean Dujardin, Bérénice Bejo, and John Goodman. Directed by: Michel Hazanavicius.",10,4,6,26 December 2011
There's Something About Mary," Something about this seems off
","The Farrelly Brothers always try to include at least one gross out scene in their movies. In There's Something About Mary the scene is when Ben Stiller is masturbating before his big date with Cameron Diaz. When Stiller finishes, he goes to the door only to find out the sperm is on his ear. Diaz mistakes it for hair gel, puts it in her hair, and that leads to one of many comical situations in There's Something About Mary.While not all of the film is hilarious, many scenes to squeeze out a bad or a good laugh. Ben Stiller plays Ted Stroehmann who was a geeky braceface in High School who had a date with Mary (Diaz) for Senoir Prom. Because of an embarrassing accident Ted was unable to accompany Mary to that prom and has never seen her since.Thirteen years later, Ted hires Pat (Dillon), a sleazeball private detective who falls head of heels when he finds Mary who now lives in Miami. Pat lies to Ted about Mary's life so he can have her all to herself. Ted believes something is up, and it becomes a game for Mary's love.Cameron Diaz is one of my favorite female leads because she is one of the very actors/actresses that can go crazy without getting carried away. Unlike Jim Carrey who is so over the top and ridiculous he is unwatchable, but Diaz has smarts and clever wit behind her gags which makes her a joy to watch on screen.There's Something About Mary is way more clever than Dumb and Dumber, but it still has things that bother me. Mainly the ridiculous and obnoxious scenes of Ben Stiller fighting with Mary's roommate's dog Puffy that goes on and on. Obviously the dog fighting is not real, but I've always felt squeamish, uncomfortable, and just upset by anytime of animal harm in films.The scene is around three minutes in length, and it's unnecessary. I don't see the humor of a grown humor wrestling with a dog on a floor bending, squeezing, choking, strangling, and harming a defenseless dog. Major downfall in the quality just because of an unnecessary scene.Besides the mean-spirited clip, There's Something About Mary not only charms in humor but it's characters are strong. Stiller and Dillon are a great on screen pair even though Dillon makes you hate his character the whole time he is on screen. Not to mention Chris Elliot is great as well. The true highlight is Cameron Diaz, but the whole cast is just perfect in their own right.There's Something About Mary is a few points shy of being 'the perfect comedy' film.Starring: Ben Stiller, Cameron Diaz, Matt Dillon, Chris Elliot, Lee Evans, and Lin Shaye. Directed by: Bobby and Peter Farrelly.",7,0,1,29 March 2011
Saw," See Saw
","It is understandable that when people think about the Saw franchise now, images appearing as snuff and torture cloud their minds. Speaking from someone who has seen the first, second, and final film of the franchise, I can definitely see where the series began and how differently it ended. To me, it was a film that could've stood perfectly on its own. It never needed a sequel, let alone six, leaching off of its coattails.After the astonishing success of the first film, grossing over one hundred million at the box office, it almost became a yearly tradition to release a Saw sequel around Halloween. Hollywood had successfully turned Saw, a suspenseful and intriguing psychological thriller, into a shameless, inept cash-in for the season of fright.At least we have the first film to remind us that this series was once destined for greatness. The film begins with Adam (Whannell), a voyeuristic photographer and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Elwes), an oncologist, awaking in a dilapidated basement to find that they are chained at the ankle to opposite ends of the room, with a bloody corpse in the middle of them. They find that they each have tape-recordings that, when played, reveal the ominous voice of our antagonist. Call him the 'Jigsaw Killer.' He informs them that they have, in some way, taken life for granted and that Dr. Gordon must kill Adam in six hours to be set free.Meanwhile, the film is intercut with scenes of detectives trying to piece together the explicit tracks left by this notorious killer. He is constantly kidnapping people who take life for granted and have it all, but choose to dispose of it in a careless, unorthodox manner. A drug addict woman and a man who enjoys inflicting self-harm on himself are among his victims. Detectives David Tapp (Glover) and Steven Sing (Leung) continue to breathlessly map out his killings and try to figure out where his notorious tapes are being shot. The Jigsaw Killer, himself, is obviously a real person, but is voiced through a creepy puppet with stringy black hair, swirly red cheeks, and always riding on a tricycle.The film knows how to create atmosphere effectively. Many scenes are unsettling, but I found the most fun to come out of the scenes between Adam and Dr. Gordon. Saw compliments my rule of claustrophobic filmmaking perfectly which is, when you limit characters geographically you must make up for it with dialog and subtleties to properly convey tone and development. Both Elwes and Whannell do great justice to their roles and play them convincingly, and the flashback scenes never seem to derail the film or make it stumble without direction.I feel some have written off the film as being 'too gory,' when in reality, Saw doesn't have as much as gore as I remember. It's more of a clever, tricky, psychological thriller perfectly complimented style and dialog. The last five minutes of the film are fabulous, and don't become winded and lazy. It actually becomes quite mysterious, brutal, and above all, intriguing, with the intro to the credits being actually somewhat depressing. This is a well-written horror film, reminding us that PG-13 can't do justice to the genre physically or mentally.Starring: Leigh Whannell, Cary Elwes, Danny Glover, Monica Potter, Michael Emerson, Ken Leung, and Tobin Bell.

Mama," By 'serviceable' I mean mediocre
","Mama is like a walk down memory lane, but when I say 'walk,' I employ the word more like a trudge and by 'memory lane' I mean the lane of rehashed ideas. Certainly a gifted performance by Jessica Chastain, one of the strongest female character actors working today, and some delightful atmospheric shots buoy it to a more watchable level, but this is a basic tutorial suspense filmmaking in 2013. And by 'basic tutorial' I mean Cliff Notes.I suppose for the least-demanding, Mama works as a completely serviceable diversion from life's tribulations. We begin by seeing a distraught man named Jeffrey, who, in the wake of losing nearly everything in the bitter financial crisis of 2007, kills his business partners, kills his wife, and then takes his two small children (a three year old and a one year old) out to a remote cabin to kill them too.They survive a crash after Jeffrey drives recklessly on a road covered with snow, and proceed to take shelter in a rundown cabin. Just as Jeffrey is about to pull the gun on the children when a demonic figure attacks him and kills him almost instantly. Five years later, they are found by Lucas (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), Jeffrey's brother and his wife Annabel (Jessica Chastain), his wife. Both children are severely ill, savage, and appear to be haunted by a figure they call 'mama.' Annabel agrees to take them in and try to give them a safe, viable haven, but as we all know, these children are seriously not right and they rightfully belong in a private institution. But don't worry; she's got this.It's no wonder why Mama is January-fare; it is practically a poster-child for why the horror genre is such a disappointing venture today. Everything is inclusive here from creepy children, to eerily offputting home, to brave woman at the center, to foreseeable jump scares that have continued to not pose much of an effect on me. There comes a time when techniques tread from seriousness to self-parody and all of those techniques have well walked past the boundaries of self-parody and are almost entering the territory of being laughable.Chastain is a terrific woman, who has already made herself marketable, being featured in projects from The Help to Zero Dark Thirty. Here, she is simply left with not much to do, and all we get is a blank character with an attractive Goth look and a big enough heart to allow two unhealthy children in her home. The other characters we get are pretty archetypal; either victims or redundant creepy caricatures. The two little girls, while seemingly decent young talents, scared me about as much as your average Scooby-Doo episode.Mama benefits from Andy Muschietti's smooth, conservative camera-work that takes something of a less-is-more approach to the material, before quickly abandoning it in the later acts and some interesting musical choices to alleviate the environment and surroundings. Yet it includes many clichés that simply can not go overlooked, even when the aesthetic material is above average. And by 'includes' I mean 'is plagued by.'Starring: Jessica Chastain, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, Megan Charpentier, Isabelle Nélisse, and Daniel Kash. Directed by: Andy Muschietti.",4,1,7,8 May 2013
Super 8," A mix of everything classic
","From online buzz, from friends hammering it in my head, from Super Bowl ads, to theater previews, I've seen the trailer for Super 8 about fifteen times. Short versions, long versions, two to three minute versions, I was sick of it. I said I didn't want to see it and ignored previews of it in theaters. That changed when I read reviews. I heard it was a seventies, eighties homage in a way and Abrams and Spielberg work wonders.If I would've ignored this film and saw it on DVD, as planned, I would've been angry and ashamed of myself. Super 8 officially earns my pick as my favorite film of 2011 at the halfway mark. We are halfway through another year of movies and Super 8 has outdone itself and certainly showed off more than I could've imagined.One of my favorite J.J. Abrams' films is the forgotten Joy Ride. he produced/wrote the film which I found heavily enjoyable and mark it as one of my favorite horror films. He sure knew how to develop the characters and conduct them in a believable fashion rather than having them be cliché protagonists. We got backstory and we got action. Enough to keep my intrigued the whole ride.Super 8 is a film where I'd prefer discussing my feelings about it rather than the plot itself. I'll explain it simplistically so nothing is ruined; a group of tweens in the summer of 1979 are making their own short film on a Super 8 camera. During the filming of a train scene, they witness a horrible and vicious train accident that causes a major derail for the gigantic train and nearly ends the lives of the kids.Now the town is being faced with something beyond anyone's expectations. Dogs disappear and the military's presence disrupts the town's natural flow. I refuse to go further than that. I knew all of that before going into it. Don't let yourself know more than that, if that.As for the film, it's one of the most electrifying and riveting experiences I've had the movies in recent years. Maybe it's because the film's protagonist, young teens like I mentioned, have the same interests as me. Girls and movies. I think the most heart-warming thing about Super 8 is it knows where it came from. It doesn't rely on 3D technology or poorly done CGI to make a film. CGI is used, but in the most effective and proper way since District 9.The film is a main homage to films like Close Encounters, E.T., The Goonies, Gremlins, Jaws, and other science fiction films done by Spielberg himself. It even resembles that of a drive in film you'd catch on a late Saturday in the seventies. It is done like it would be in 1979 minus the computer animation.The kid actors made the film. I loved the male lead Joel Courtney and the female lead Elle Fanning, Dakota Fanning's little sister. Both play the roles with authentic and believable reactions to this extremely massive event taking place. The music only adds to some of the scenes in the film that are still done with dead on tonality and effective camera work, props to J.J. Abrams, again.Super 8's ending can spark criticism. I wasn't a favorite of it, but I really believe it's because both Abrams and Spielberg couldn't think of an effective way to conclude a film like this. I will give it the benefit of the doubt and hope the DVD will receive an alternate ending or two to assure more satisfaction. Regardless, this is an amazing action film that blends a perfect mix of comedy, drama, coming of age, apocalyptic, science-fiction, and numerous other genres to make one indescribable film. It's something that needs to be witnessed on the big screen.Starring: Joel Courtney, Elle Fanning, and Kyle Chandler. Directed by: J.J. Abrams.",9,3,8,11 June 2011
Sinister," It's all in the details for both us and Ellison
","Research and questioning are two of the most powerful activities a human being can partake in. Absorbing yourself in a story or a crime case is something that is just as powerful, as well. During the time of the tragic Aurora, Colorado theater shooting and the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that absolutely tore the United States apart as a whole, you couldn't pry my fingers away from the keyboard or my face from the monitor. I never saw myself so in-tuned , captivated, disgusted, and riveted by a news story in all my life.Thankfully, I never experience an obsession with a case or past events like the one our lead character Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) in Sinister immerses himself into. He is a consumed crime author, who wrote a successful book some years ago, and decides to leave his old home behind and take his wife Tracy (Juliet Rylance) and their two children Ashley (Clare Foley) and Trevor (Michael Hall D'Addario) to live in an old, spacious home that was once the site of an unexplainable crime scene. The only one who knows this is Ellison, who is warned upon his arrival by the town deputy (James Ransone) that living here isn't smart, but he is so involved with his career as an author he doesn't listen.Ellison begins to find old Super 8 films in the attic of the home, discovering that they're snuff films depicting various grisly murders and usually titled by an ambiguous event and date ('Sleep Time '98' is the name of one). His minor fascination turns wholly consuming, as he locks himself in his study, playing the films on a rickety old projector, desperately trying to uncover the mystery of the house. During this time, his children begin exhibiting the strangest of behaviors and his wife's tolerance and silence to his reclusive nature becomes unrelenting and maddening on her part.Sinister opens on the precise foot, creepy, unnerving, and yes, terrifying. It shows Super 8 footage of four people, all standing below a tree, with nooses around their neck and hoods covering their faces before something cuts off one of the tree's limbs, which acts as a counterweight, successfully hanging all four of the characters. This is a wrenching scene that perfectly sets the tone for the film we're about to see.There's a surprising sophistication to the material in Sinister, which makes it the most surprising horror effort of last year. For a mainstream release, it's stunningly atmospheric and almost poetry stemming from Gothic roots. I can only compare it, recently, to The Woman in Black, a film attempting to replicate the style and potency that is found in Hammer Horror films. At the center of that film was Harry Potter's Daniel Radcliffe, doing one of his first solo, grown-up roles after years of being the subject of a lucrative franchise. Sinister throws Ethan Hawke in a wonderfully subtle performance, providing depth and massive conflict to his character as a whole.The thing about Sinister is, by horror film standards, it does much more than we expect it to, and for that matter, does it all to a certain level of efficiency and craft. It abandons much of the 'jump-scare' cliché, and uses it cautiously and with great effect, it focuses on characters, disciplined and rational, it shows Ellison's descent into obsession effectively and realistically, relies on setting, sound, and tone to invoke fear in its audience, and pulls out an engaging story to tie everything back together.The film's best scene comes shortly after the hour mark and involves Ellison and Tracy angrily spitting words with venom and hate back and forth, Ellison saying how his book, while potentially sacrificing his family's safety, will buoy them financially, and Tracy saying how he has become such an unrecognizable man being buried and eaten alive by his work. This gives a good ethics debate for the average audience member, who is usually sitting frozen or bored, yet likewise, waiting for something to happen; is it okay to sacrifice personal welfare for potential financial security or live a cautious life with no security? Finally, one detail I forgot to mention was the use of sound in Sinister, not just from the abrupt scares or the sudden 'pangs' in the night, but the click of the Super 8 film, the whirring of the projector, the snapping of the film, and the crackling static of the sound quality. This is a more stylistically alive film, in terms of classic detail, than the latter Paranormal Activity series.Starring: Ethan Hawke, Juliet Rylance, Fred Thompson, James Ransone, Clare Foley, and Michael Hall D'Addario.

Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," 'If you can't board the right plane we'll have to cancel future trips, Kevin!'
","Home Alone 2: Lost in New York is a sequel that is almost identical in quality and plot to the first. The first film was a fresh new idea, but often misunderstood by people who weren't taking into consideration it was an exercise in childhood escapism. When you can look past its implausibility, it's a unique and amusing film for many, but different generations and different audiences will gradually differ in responses.Now we have a sequel, which right off the bat sends me into useless quibbles. He doesn't have a home in New York, so how is he home alone? This could've easily been its own stand alone film if the characters were all different and just be called the film's subtitle 'Lost in New York.' But would it sell as well? Probably not. So bring back the three actors and we have ourselves a sequel.The plot seems to be lifted directly from the original film. Due to a severe mix-up at the airport where Kevin (Culkin) follows a man wearing the same coat as his father, he is taken on a flight to New York instead of with his family who is going to Florida for Christmas. Kevin fearlessly checks himself into a hotel, gets settled in, then realizes the criminals he beat the hell out of (Pesci and Stern) in the first film come back and now have placed him back in their cross-hairs.From there on out the plot becomes more jokes about being hit on the head and running away frantically. I give Macaulay Culkin a boatload of credit for not being one of the childhood actors like the ones on Full House where they spend a lot of their time standing still and looking cute. Culkin provides cute, boyish charm while creating eventful mishaps on screen. Just like in the first film; some antics are funny, some are redundant without being funny.We also get a strange subplot with an old woman who enjoys feeding pigeons. She has been considered the 'old creep' in town and has been shunned by her peers. That's how Kevin feels with his big family most of the time. Their connection is slim, but acceptable. While at the same time it feels almost contrived and not a very needed subplot. It does rest the tired hit-on-the-head jokes that have been hit over our head, pun intended, during the course of the film.Home Alone 2: Lost in New York provides some nice shots of New York, some decently executed dialog, and delightful cameos like Ally Sheedy, Donald Trump, and, my favorite, Tim Curry. The only downside is you're watching the same film. It still fuels the 'childhood escapism' tank like I mentioned before, but it does hardly anything new with it. It just rehashes a formula previously seen before. More imagination to the story could've been taken into consideration.Or maybe, just not have a sequel at all. The first was an unexpected success, it did very well in theaters, and is still played repeatedly during the holiday season. The concept of a child being left alone to fend for himself by accident is a possible thing. Unfortunately, the sequel does little to expand the idea except by removing the four walls barricading the kid in the first film and giving him a full city to work with. A lot happens in this two hours. Quite a lot of things. Plausible or not, it's beginning to get very redundant. I suggest parental counseling and a dog leash.Starring: Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci, and Daniel Stern. Directed by: Chris Columbus.",7,0,1,18 November 2011
3 Idiots," Scarcely has a comedy provided its audience with so much insight, intelligence, and human affection
","'All is well,' the three 'idiot' heroes of 3 Idiots recite when they become frazzled or nervous, while frantically tapping their hearts. They know that reciting the oversimplifying phrase will not provide their problems with a solution, or even a catalyst, but it gives them the onset courage they desperately need at a time of uncertainty and despair. One character even tries to use the line after an amateurishly-given birth may have gone terribly wrong. It's times like that when the saying may not be so effective, even if its goal is not to provide certain relief.But all is well, as they so often say. Rajkumar Hirani's 3 Idiots, my introduction to the world of Bollywood cinema, is a comedy-drama unlike any one I've ever seen, long, but never drawn out, frantic, but never desperate, and emotional, but never manipulating. It provides us with three of the most likable characters of the last decade, and with insight to the culture of Indians and their parents. Rarely has a comedy had this big of a brain in its head and a canvas of opportunities in mind, while possessing a title not even fit for a farce.Our title characters are ambitious but stunted Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan), jittery, fearful Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi), and borderline prodigy Ranchhoddas 'Rancho' Shamaldas Chhanchad (Aamir Khan), three close friends who attend the Imperial College of Engineering (ICE), one of India's most prestigious colleges where only the best are accepted. The young boys already are facing some of life's greatest challenges, all of them pursuing the field of engineering when the only one who seems to have a passion for the material is Rancho. Farhan was forced to become skilled in the field because of his strict father, and Raju is pursuing the field with the goal of getting his family out of poverty, with his father's expensive health bills, his mother's fragile core, and his sister's inability to marry all on the table. Rancho is studying because he feels that one should pursue passion and make a career out of it, so it doesn't feel like work. If you're passionate and devoted to your work, success will find you - yet this is only one of the countless morals and insights 3 Idiots provide its viewer with.The film chronicles their issues in college in flashback, with instances in the presence popping up to show Farhan and Raju searching for their pal Rancho, who has disappeared and avoided contact for several years now. This is not your typical flashback film, however. It uses this method much to its advantage, and doesn't feel like a narrative within a narrative. It seals both stories nicely, but it takes the viewer on a roller-coaster ride of emotions through carefully constructed events before it even arrives at those endings.One of their problems in college is the professor/dean of the campus, Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani), who the three derogatorily call 'Virus' when his back is turned. Virus is strict and often largely unsympathetic to the problems of his students, which allows the film to explore a dark topic one assumes a comedy wouldn't dare cross paths with and that is the issue of Indian teen suicide. One kid had his father have a stroke, rendering him unable to focus on academics for months, falling gravely behind. Virus is grossly unsympathetic to his case, denying him an extension on a project he's work so unrealistically hard on but can not perfect.If anything, we can say 3 Idiots is a message to the parents of the Indian youth and that is to stop applying pressure to an already stressed out demographic. I've read several articles articulating the point that Indian teenagers are among one of the highest in suicide rates, and that many parents put an unrealistic amount of pressure, duty, and responsibility on the child to the point of a physical and mental collapse. You're given the unalienable freedom to raise your kids with the method you choose, but not every method is perfect, and when your method is one of the ones that leads to suicide, mental health problems, and perpetuates fear and anxiety in the minds of teenagers, then you may want to reevaluate your methods.3 Idiots also provides us with the idea that many Indian children are told what to become in life early and are discouraged from exploration or even personal ambition. This I can't believe. What an unhappy, uninspiring, completely wasted life to slog through everyday doing something you loathe all because it was the lucky career choice of your parents. Yet I'm sure millions have been lead through this same life. It's the worst way of 'living through a person' that I can imagine.The film runs ten minutes shy of three hours, which for few viewers may seem too long and uncomfortable. I was skeptical myself walking in rather blind. Almost every Bollywood film I've conducted research on seems to run an upwards of three hours, some extending and testing the waters to roughly five hours. If other Bollywood works have characters drawn along the same lines of being relatable, human, and easily accessible and not biased towards race or social class, I can't see it being a struggle to get through any of the industry's films.Through every quick-witted song and dance number, through every comedic scene, through every instance of dramatic despair, emotionally alive moment, solemnly poignant sequence, suspenseful setup, to a lovely, heartfelt conclusion, 3 Idiots is a wonderful, invaluable endeavor in the world of film. Its actors are beautifully fitting for their roles, assisted by a script so human and true to life that it is honestly hard to believe, and captured through beautifully alive cinematography to collectively give us a beautiful package not just in the figurative sense. This is arguably one of the best comedies I've ever seen.",10,55,84,3 January 2013
Up," Animation is no longer an airless timekiller and whoever still calls it one hasn't been paying attention
","The first fifteen minutes of Pixar's Up play like a full-length movie, featuring a reserved amount of dialog and a beautiful collection of clips that show a childhood friendship that amounted into a healthy, lasting relationship that ended in sadness. The relationship was between Carl, a shy young boy who idolizes the explorer Charles F. Muntz, and Ellie, an eclectic young girl who turns an old, rundown home into a headquarters for her club. The two meet out of nowhere one day, spark an immediate, offbeat friendship predicated on their love for exploring new places, get married, and endure decades of happiness before nature takes its course and Ellie passes away. Up details this in a beautiful, unforgettable fifteen minutes, leading to one of the most impacting scenes of animated emotion I have ever seen.Carl (voiced by Edward Asner) is now elderly, living in the aforementioned rundown house that acts as an island in the center of construction in the big city. Suits try to get Carl to sell his home, but he refuses, until seemingly admitting defeat after an incident with one of the workers turns violent. Carl manages to strap thousands of balloons to his home and, utilizing a complex steering system pioneered by his wife for fun when they were kids, manages to lift the house from the ground and sail through the vast, open blue skies. His destination is Paradise Falls, located in Venezuela, an exotic land where him and his wife always believed they'd reside.However, unwanted company accidentally hitches a ride in the form of Russell (Jordan Nagai), a totally harmless little boy scout anxious to obtain his 'helping the elderly badge.' Before taking off in house, Carl instructed Russell out of kindness to capture a beast that has been tearing up his yard, and Russell returns on Carl's front porch to state his success when he is unwillingly taken up, up, and away along with Carl's entire home. The two wind up sticking together on this trip, both getting more than they bargained for when a nearly extinct bird and an unconventional talking dog turn up in their path as well.If there was ever a film to prove even the most hard-hearted that animation can be a wondrous medium that is capable of showing deep emotion, Up is the one. Writers Bob Peterson and Pete Docter (the Monsters, Inc. franchise) have successfully crafted Pixar's most adult script in terms of theme, focusing on the ideas of death, tribute, and closure, but capturing it in such a way that will not bore or miss the mark with young children. It wouldn't be far-fetched in my eyes to call Docter 'John Lasseter Jr.,' since he possesses ambition akin to Lasseter's early animation days.If anything, this is thanks to the Docter, who utilizes both his directorial efforts with Pixar to create some of their biggest films in terms of visual scope and range. Monsters, Inc. featured an unprecedented amount of visual flair and colorful content. Consider the scene that took place inside the factory of many doors the monsters could use to enter a young child's bedroom. In one shot, when Mike and Sully are desperately holding on to one door, hundreds, if not thousands of doors are shown in just one shot. In several shots in Up, hundreds, if not thousands of multi-colored balloons are shown, which I'm sure posed and animating nightmare for the production team. The film had such a lengthy production history, a list of 'production babies' - babies born during the making of the film - reaches about thirty or so children.The plot of Up works as a piece of escapism because it seems to be everyone's fantasy at one point or another - the fantasy being the ability to escape life's current issues by abandoning them entirely and having to answer to no one. In an essence, the film is a staple of what all animated film should include: lovable characters, a beautiful sense of adventure, the right amount of emotion leverage, extraordinary action sequences, and adult themes tackled in a digestible (but not condescending) way for young children. The revolutionary aspect of Up comes while watching this, realizing that animation is not just a timekiller for children, but an unbelievable art-form that will no hopefully no longer go shortchanged in discussions concerning cinema.Voiced by: Edward Asner, Jordan Nagai, Bob Peterson, and Christopher Plummer.

A Clockwork Orange," Mean-spirited for the sake of a message
","A Clockwork Orange isn't an atypical classic because nearly everything you can say about it has already been said. Praising it has become a pretty traditional thing to do, and if you dare criticize it, then you must endure not just the cult-fanbase but the Kubrick-fanbase. I wouldn't wish backlash from both of those groups on an enemy.Howeer, I shouldn't be hearing it from either. Stanley Kubrick's controversial classic is a troubling but required watch, adapted from Anthony Burgess's novel, which is rumored to be inspired from a personal instance. Burgess's wife was brutally assaulted by a group of thugs at one point, and Burgess tried to penetrate the psychology of such unconscionable men who would dare commit such a disgusting, degrading act. If this is true - and Kubrick left Burgess's message from the novel in tact - then the stance he takes here is stunningly humanistic and brave.The film stars a young, energetic Malcolm McDowell as Alex, a young man who commits unsightly atrocities such as rape and assault upon getting innocent people to open their doors thinking they're doing a helpless soul a favor who they believe was in a car-wreck. He commits these crimes with a gang of men he calls his 'droogs,' and their spree resorts to an ugly but surprisingly professional scene of rape. During this scene, Alex sings a familiar song you will not see in the same light again (similar to how Alex will later react to a specific song, but I'm getting ahead of myself).Alex is eventually arrested and thrown into prison, but he's given an option upon entering the compound. He can be simply jailed or he can be psychologically conditioned - a new process that can help him - to be good and moral. He chooses to be conditioned and undergoes a series of mentally trying tests that take his individuality, regardless of how despicable it is, along with the basic qualities of him being a human with free-will. After the lengthy psychological processes are complete, he's released back into society as a changed man.Though it predated techno-music pioneer Gary Numan's career by a few years, A Clockwork Orange seems like a cinematic adaptation of one of Numan's darkest, eeriest songs. From the stunningly cold voice of Alex, to the futuristic, dystopian environment, to the beautifully polished set-designs, it seems as if this is a Gary Numan song with the benefit of being a one-hundred and thirty-eight minute music video. All I was waiting for in the end was the Machman to show up.Moreover, the content of this film is widely known to be explicit and still somewhat shocking to this date. But make no mistake in saying the film is mean-spirited just to be mean-spirited. The film's commentary on psychological conditioning taking away human individuality and free will and devaluing ones worth to making him a conforming citizen in a world with diminishing uniqueness is strong and potent. A Clockwork Orange isn't an exploitation film and it isn't a film with violence for violence's sake. The film goes to great lengths to detail psychology and conditioning to the point where it wouldn't be a stretch to name it one of the field's biggest films.The film is also another case where the lead actor and director team up to make an incredible match. Malcolm McDowell gives a tremendous performance here that's troubling, alive, and coldly inspiring. McDowell is only elevated by Stanley Kubrick's typically wide-angle shots and very spacious long shots that show the landscape of the shots and the futuristic design of Kubrick's vision. These talents combined give A Clockwork Orange the strong performance and directorial leverage it needs to communicate its story and message significantly.Finally, it must be said that A Clockwork Orange was going to be a challenge to adapt to the screen no matter assumed what position. The novel is more heavy on the slang than the film, and featured a large glossary in the back of the book defining every word clearly. The film doesn't have that privilege and likely several others that are exclusive to the novel. As all book-to-movie adaptations, the film provides the benefits of a specific (not an absolute, as many confuse) vision of the novel's work and, as a result, may offer the best adaptation one will ever see of the novel.Starring: Malcolm McDowell. Directed by: Stanley Kubrick.",10,1,6,18 September 2013
Woman in Gold," When personality is squandered for linear storytelling
","'Woman in Gold' tells an extraordinary story with the utmost ordinariness in style and structure. It uses what I fear will become the newfound 'Philomena' cliché of a stubborn, moody old white lady getting helped by a square, middle-aged white man who grows to appreciate a walk of life he apparently never even knew existed before. The only difference was 'Philomena' worked because of strong chemistry between its leads and a story that was told in an impacting manner, articulating the core of the events within proper emotional and narrative boundaries. 'Woman in Gold' is what happens when all of that is traded for what looks to be a 'collect the check' job on all fronts, where everyone involved just seems more concerned with collecting their pay rather than telling a story with the significance and heart it not only bears but deserves.The film revolves around Maria Altmann (Helen Mirren), a Jewish refugee living in Los Angeles, who seeks the help of a lawyer named Randol Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds) to recover Gustav Klimt's iconic painting of her aunt, known as Portrait of Adele Block-Bauer I. During the time of World War II, the painting was confiscated by the Nazis and now hangs in a museum in Vienna, Austria, where it is as renowned as the Mona Lisa. Maria and Randol travel to Vienna to try and convince the Austrian government to allow Maria to claim the painting, but the government has made it virtually impossible for anyone who isn't wealthy beyond their wildest imagination to sue or challenge the government. Eventually, the two return to America, following a breathless bout of walking in circles, to discover that they can sue the Austrian government on American soil due to the painting being licensed for commercial use in America. What entails is an exhausting legal battle that is taken all the way to the Supreme Court.'Woman in Gold''s first immediate problem is it can't do anything without oversimplifying. Within the first fifteen minutes of the film, Maria meets Randol, she tell him the story of her aunt and Klimt's painting, and they are off to Vienna in a flash. The legal battle that apparently takes so many months to progress and move to the Supreme Court is covered within about five minutes in montage and, when we do see glimpses inside the courtroom, it's the same kind of artificial, theatrical environment we've grown accustomed to in American movies. Finally, every wall the characters run into in their quest to obtain what is rightfully theirs always seems to pose a way out that's almost too clean to exist. Every way around the Austrian government is portrayed as a flash-in-the-pan, revolutionary moment that makes you wonder why these two bright individuals didn't think of that before they started (IE: the cost of suing the Austrian government being in the millions - shouldn't they have known that as a 'worst case scenario' event?).It's also worth noting that it's impossible for a dynamic to be achieved between both Mirren and Reynolds because screenwriter Alexi Kaye Campbell doesn't write a line of dialog that's purpose is to paint both of these individuals as characters and not narrative vessels. Every conversation these two have between one another is about the case or about the history; none of dialog works to humanize either party and it isn't until the end we realize that due to how little we're impacted by the outcome of it all. This gives 'Woman in Gold' a dreary and dull personality, and makes it even more disappointing to see two great actors squandered for the sake of persistent plot progression.'Woman in Gold' is one of several films to be released over the last two years that concerns art, the creation of art, and to whom the art should belong to. Last year, George Clooney's 'The Monuments Men' was a misguided effort, but found success in at least detailing the process of obtaining valuable works that the Nazis had stolen, a subject that's only now really circulating into the mainstream. In addition, we also had Tim Burton's 'Big Eyes,' which, while a bit different, found itself infusing style and visual flair into a story that probably wouldn't have clicked had no personality been injected into the screenplay and the visual aesthetic. 'Woman in Gold' is another film that takes a hugely important topic and squanders it, and, now more than ever, we need not only another film on Nazi art thieves, but a good one at long last.",4,16,31,6 April 2015
Groundhog Day," Experimental comedy filmmaking
","NOTE: Contains very minor spoilers...Groundhog Day is a miracle comedy, housing in every genre a film can handle such as truly haunting science-fiction, a beautiful romance, uproariously funny comedy, enticing drama, and a beautiful 'seize the day' message tacked on as a nicely tied-bow instead of a completely manipulative screen writing device.At the film's core is a career-making performance by Billy Murray, an actor who can play a man of condescending intellect, deeply-rooted vulnerability, and charismatic and charming qualities all within the same scene. He is ideal for the character of Phil Connors, a local-area meteorologist sent to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities in the sleepy town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania for the fourth year in a row. He loathes doing it because of the holiday's inherent silliness but goes along with it anyway in a smug fashion.The events of the day involve him waking up in his hotel-room, eating breakfast, rushing to the festivities, running into an old 'friend' from school who now sells insurance, and then being stuck in a blizzard on the way home. The day is long and merciless and Phil can't wait to fall asleep and start February 3rd. However, when Phil wakes up, it's still February 2nd and the same events unfold as if they'd never occurred. Phil is now reliving a day that went from terrible to an inconceivable nightmare over and over again. Each day's events become inconsequential happenings, as no matter what Phil does, he'll wake up at the same time, in the same hotel-room in the same fashion to the same song on the clock-radio, as if someone pushed a reset button on everything.At first, Phil panics and worries, trying to make sense of what is happening. Nobody understands what he's going through (how can they?) and nobody seems to be in this same, alternate universe as Phil. As days turn into weeks, Phil begins having fun, causing a little bit of havoc, being sent to prison, annoying people in his life, etc. He uses it in a hedonistic way in some cases, as he waltzes down to the diner, abruptly and arbitrarily asks a girl for her personal information before returning the following day and using the newfound information to make a move on her.But after a while, the effect becomes sickening to Phil, who realizes that even committing suicide is only met with the same result of waking up in the same hotel-room. What writers Danny Rubin and director Harold Ramis pull off, however, is something I would've never expected. They make it so the repetition wears on Phil but also the audience in a way that doesn't make the film boring or irritating but in a way that almost treads on empathy. It's a difficult thing to accurately summarize, but after watching the same day being relived on a consistent basis, with the scene of Phil waking up to the same annoying tune on the radio, begins to wear on us in a way that we feel as if we're stuck in this time loop as well. When Phil tries to explain his predicament to others, it's as if we're trying to explain to them what's happening in our heads (or, in some cases, maybe aloud) and can't get anyone to understand or listen to us.Rubin and Ramis put us under a spell and give us no answers, another daring move on their behalf. We're never given a justification as to how long Phil is stuck in this trance (although Ramis has informally states anywhere from ten years to 10,000 years, which, with that information, just exhausts a person by the very thought of that) or, the bigger question, why?. This is wonderful because adding an explanation could've cheapened the entire film and its boldly original story, although perhaps both writers, who seemed to be on a neverending winning streak with their material here, could've found an original way to pull it off.Furthermore, the film has an incredibly black concept for a comedy that can be so funny at times. The idea of this time loop occurring is something to tie your mind in knots, but if thought about at great length, the film is deeply haunting. Imagine one of your worst days being repeated over and over again with nothing you could do to escape it. Suicide isn't an option, staying in bed won't always work, and you can't tell anyone your problems because they simply will not make the slightest sense of them (neither can you, really). With Bill Murray at the center, the film manages to be both equal parts hilarious as well as dark and often bleak as can be.Groundhog Day is sublime black-comedy filmmaking, housing an original premise, a brilliantly written script, an engaging and simultaneously depressing Bill Murray performance, and a concept to thoroughly contemplate. Being that Rubin and Ramis take so many risks with the storytelling, the concept, and the project, and discard conventional routes of explanation and simple justification, this could effectively be called experimental comedic filmmaking.Starring: Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliot. Directed by: Harold Ramis.",10,0,1,5 March 2014
Love & Mercy," A film about the two things we're constantly bound by
","It's no secret that with the plethora of biopics we get every year, there is a formula that many of them follow. Just last year, we got to see the stories of a wayward soul who ventured out on a soul-cleansing journey through the mountains, a computer genius who cracked a presumably unbreakable code during war times, one of the deadliest snipers in American history, and one of funk's greatest musicians told on film. Bill Pohland's 'Love & Mercy,' concerning the life of Beach Boys singer Brian Wilson, is bound to be written off by some as another interchangeable biopic, but if you've seen so much as a trailer for this film, you know this is something deeper, richer, and more complex than formula could ever begin to handle.'Love & Mercy' focuses on two times pieced together, as Pohland and the writing team of Michael Alan Lerner and Oren Moverman segway between the 'past' Brian Wilson, played by Paul Dano, and the 'future' Brian Wilson, played by John Cusack, never telling us exactly where the present lies. We follow Wilson during his rise with his brothers and friends to make The Beach Boys one of America's most successful boy bands in the 1960's. Despite initial success with The Beach Boys, following a severe panic attack, Wilson resigns from the band to focus on writing back home in California. He's convinced he has found the formula for 'the greatest rock album ever,' experimenting with a plethora of different melodies, instruments, and lyrics to create something one can not only hear and enjoy, but feel.While undergoing this arduous process, Wilson is met with little vocal support. He receives the casual head nods from most of his bandmates, with the exception of Michael Love (Jake Abel), who constantly criticizes his creative decisions, and his father, who is still bitter after being fired by his own son. While focusing on this, we frequently jump into Brian's life in the future, where he is placed under the care of Dr. Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti in another brutal but compelling role), who over-medicates and physically and mentally abuses him. Brian winds up meeting and falling for a Cadillac saleswoman named Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks), who constantly wants to be with him but finds Dr. Landy to be a smothering force preventing their connection from growing.Pohland's experimental structure for 'Love & Mercy' is nothing shy of remarkable, but the fact that it doesn't make the film feel off balance or tonally uneven is a total cinematic anomaly. While frequently weaving through different time periods seems ripe for complete chaos for a film trying to keep a consistent tone, 'Love & Mercy' handles the challenge beautifully, humanizing Brian regardless of his age and working to find the core idea in each scene.I've long asserted that Paul Dano is one of the finest actors in cinema today and 'Love & Mercy' is another link in his ever-growing chain of terrific performances. Similar to his role in 'Prisoners,' Dano must remain relatively expressionless and look as if nothing is occurring inside his head, when really, there is too much going on in his head to accurately communicate. Dano, once again, blindsides the audience by taking a role that seems too facile to carry a film and making it a fleshed out, thoroughly impressive performance. John Cusack also delivers a role much like Dano, channeling his kind of emptiness so well that it's like watching two actors in different time periods of their life playing a character in different time periods of his own life. The result is a mesmerizing, surreal experience.'Love & Mercy''s vignette-style structure examines the heartbreak, the joy, the contentment, and the unmatched physical and mental pressure of Brian in a remarkably tender way. Robert Yeoman's cinematography also paints a picture that, while littered with nostalgia in look, costume design, and general vibes, captures Brian's hectic environment so affectionately that it becomes strangely beautiful. Through all of Brian's madness, his unpredictable panic attacks, episodes of rage, and the contemptuous relationship with his father, Pohland searches to find attributes of Brian to showcase in a way that's impacting.Calling 'Love & Mercy' a 'mesmerizing, surreal experience' is an appropriate, if ostensibly exaggerating, summation. Similar to how Brian can't always communicate the beauty behind the sound of his music, I can't quite put my finger on what works with this film and in what manner. This film, however, snuck up on me in a way that was remarkably subtle but lasting and, even though it's been several days since I've seen it, the effect remains strong in a way that only enhances the film's compelling and unique aura.",9,38,48,14 June 2015
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," 'A disturbing masterpiece'
","Pier Paolo Pasolini's Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom is among the sickest and most depraved films I have yet to see. It is also among one of the most intellectual and artistic. For a film seemingly constructed on elements that are artless and unforgivable, the man himself has created a feisty political allegory, capable of self expression, impressionism, and heavy interpretation. Things I would've never expected from a film that has been banned and outlawed in several different countries.When compared to recent torture porn films, or even those that date back several years or decades ago like Cannibal Holocaust or the distasteful and horrendous August Underground, it is shocking to stumble upon a film that features sodomy, sexual humiliation, torture, manipulation, cruelty, depravity, fascism, totalitarianism, graphic rape, homosexuality, and voyeurism all in the same film. Let alone a film that gets a recommendation by me. This is a recommendation like no other I have given. I'm recommending this to the willing, the brave, and the cinephiles. The ones who won't immediately attack it as a piece of Italian shock cinema or depravity without a purpose, but those who are prepared to judge it as a piece of commentary and cinematic art. Bringing this up in a casual conversation like you would do a majority of films, and you may have lost yourself a friend.The film focuses on the Republic of Salò in Italy, circa 1944, right after the fall of the Mussolini government, where four corrupt libertines kidnap nine boys and nine girls and subject them to four months of extreme sexual acts, acts of torture, sodomy, and ones that will test their physical and mental health. They are taken to a place in Marzabotto, where they spend their days in a luxurious palace, either committing several hateful acts or listening to descriptive stories about prostitute's sexual encounters.The film is divided into four different 'circles,' which are taken from the book The 120 Days of Sodom, by the Marquis de Sade. While the film features a plethora of nudity, it is anything but erotic. Instead it is cold, numbing, and aggressively unpleasant. We watch as unspeakable acts such as coprophagia occur and we, as audience members, can not help but question the fascist's motivations.But that is just it; there are none. Like many films about a brutally corrupt and dictative government, Battle Royale instantaneously comes to mind, there are no justifications. There are, however, a number of things that are symbolic about the world around us that we can either choose to explore and question or ignore and bury deep in our heads. The corrupt fascists obviously represent dictators of the time, such as Hitler, Mussolini, and Stalin, while the young adolescents forced to partake in these soul-crushing events represent the victims of the Holocaust. The soldiers who are constantly guarding the teenagers and assuring they don't escape could possibly be the loyal followers of the dictators that go along with the pack leader, despite personal feeling and or opinions.And then there you are - the viewer - the person who is acting as a voyeur during the events of the film. Pasolini knows exactly how he wants his audience to feel and that is guilty, unsettled, frightened, terrified, vulnerable, and most of all, voyeuristic. He blatantly calls you out for it at the end of the picture, where you become one with the corruption, laughing numbingly at the events taking place behind stone walls.The film looks like someone along the lines of Wes Anderson or Haskell Wexler picked up a camera and filmed the most provocative and inhuman shots this side of the earth. Aesthetically speaking, Salò is an intricately made picture, delicately crafted and maturely handled, with painstaking detail in every shot and elegance in every frame, even when acts of the complete opposite nature are occurring. With the use of some stellar piano music as well, this is a film that boasts all the features of a vivacious melodrama, but has all the characteristics of a seriously haunting snuff film.It is apparent that people will have different reactions to the film. Some will feel visually manipulated and appalled. Some will be stained and irreversibly shaken. Some will shut it off halfway through. Others will brave through the excursion and then question why they did. But some will see the brave qualities and ambition it took to make such a film, one that toys with the audience and then boldly criticizes them afterwards. It is noted that Pasolini, one of the many directors I need to explore, became severely depressed before venturing into this territory of filmmaking, and saw all of his films as worthless and overly-compromised, and would make a film focusing on things of an explicit nature, before being brutally murdered. I conclude with the statement that if you're optimistic and curious enough, Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom is a film to see. Just prepare yourself with the proper mindset that this is a film that should be known for its graphic detailing of political commentary and allegories and not one of its inadvertently subversive and inhuman material.Starring: Paolo Bonacelli, Giorgio Cataldi, Umberto Paolo, Quintavalle, Aldo Valletti, and Caterina Boratto. Directed by: Pier Paolo Pasolini.",8,7,10,27 July 2012
Rocky," By the end it isn't a movie
","'Ya wanna come inside?' - Rocky. 'No, I gotta go.' - Adrian. 'I gotta go too. I gotta go to the bathroom.' - Rocky.Rocky does many things right, but one of the biggest things it does exceptionally well is the dialog it packs in. The wit and humor is subtle but necessary in telling this particular story, and it only helps when a little ray of sunlight is shed on a premise so serious.What can be said about the 1976 film Rocky that hasn't already been said countless times before? That's the greatest challenge in reviewing classics, personally. When I reviewed National Lampoon's Animal House, I found myself often pausing for a long period of time or getting up and walking around contemplating what else to say. Was that it? Only five paragraphs? Surely a film so monumental deserves more than just five paragraphs.But I digress. It's difficult to review a film that has been seen by everyone, and for you yourself to try and write something unique and fresh about a film so cherished without sounding pretentious is quite a difficult task. Rocky tells the emotional and inspiring parable of an underdog fighter nicknamed 'The Italian Stallion' (Stallone) who is thirty and broke, living in the slums getting his face and body beat to hell for barely any money. He forms a relationship with a nerdy pet-shop employee named Adrian (Shire), and is given the opportunity of a lifetime to fight against champion fighter Apollo Creed (Weathers).Motivated by Adrian, and trained by her brother Paulie (Young), Rocky continues to become more confident in his abilities but at times faces a dark sense of realism that he might not be able to take on the champion. Rocky's training sequence is occupied by the instantly recognizable and famed theme song of the film that only adds to the emotion in the film.The character Rocky is effortlessly likable and as charismatic as any movie hero should be. What makes him so likable is his persistency and his devotion to becoming more than an underdog, but a true winner in the ring and in life. He's thirty, down and out in Philly, and knows he can do better. Adrian and Paulie prove it to him.Consider the impact of the scene where Rocky climbs up The Philadelphia Museum of Art staircase to the Rocky theme song. When he finally gets to the top he runs around in circles while repeatedly throwing his arms up in satisfaction. Combined with the music, a fantastic feature to the film, it only assists a great scene and proves that even simple training sequences can be brought to full effect. The scene has spawned numerous other people imitating the event, and a Stallone statue was even placed at the top of the staircase years after.When we get to the actual fight we are fully immersed in the story. It doesn't seem like a film anymore, but the fight itself might as well be a real-life Pay-Per-View event on Television. We've spent so much time with the character Rocky, and so little time away from him it's not that we can't help but love him, but truly want to see him triumph over Creed. Actor and writer Sylvester Stallone went around parading the script of Rocky to numerous studios and was turned down multiple times. Mainly because no one really knew how it would turnout. When you think about it, Rocky was one of the first, if not the first, dramatic boxing film released. Expectations were uncertain, but it soon became one of the most successful films in history grossing over $225 million against a $1 million budget. Stallone went on to make five sequels, and has been remembered for his role as the lovable boxer for years. Decades later it still holds up. And Rocky is still one of the most loved and respected underdogs ever filmed. Starring: Sylvester Stallone, Burgess Meredith, Talia Shire, Burt Young, and Carl Weathers. Directed by: John G. Alvidsen.",10,0,0,12 November 2011
Sicario," A film so unethical it makes dirt look cleaner
","Sicario may be one of the most melancholic, morally bankrupt, and ethically vacuous mainstream films to be released this year; yet, such moroseness comes with the territory of the ongoing, politician- branded 'War on Drugs.' The story concerns an idealistic FBI Specials Weapons agent named Kate Macer (Emily Blunt), who, along with her partner, Reggie Wayne (Daniel Kaluuya), are recruited to work with the CIA in order to find a man responsible for savage murders in Mexico.Doing so involves extensive work with the CIA and infiltrating cartels in Mexico, so Macer and Wayne team up with Matt Graver (Josh Brolin), a Department of Justice adviser who leads the manhunt, and Alejandro Gillick (Benicio del Toro), who are specifically targeting a cartel boss named Manuel Díaz (Bernardo P. Saracino). Díaz is believed to one of the main authorities behind Mexico's explicit involvement in the cartel. Upon arriving to Mexico and experiencing the practices of both Graver and Gillick, Macer is shocked at the amoral and corrupt nature of the CIA's practices, which have resorted to targeting innocent, often unarmed people in addition to working largely on hearsay rather than concrete evidence. Kate Macer is one of the year's most fascinating characters, and particularly one of the most compelling female characters of the year. Her presence initially rekindles thoughts of Maya in Zero Dark Thirty, who found herself nudging her way through the patriarchal CIA practices in order to further her belief as to where Osama Bin Laden was hiding out for over a decade. However, Kate is much more realistically written in a human sense. Maya felt more like an empty shell, ill-equipped to show emotion that wasn't determination or archetypal female toughness.What makes Kate Macer really interesting and believable is her mental toughness and willingness that turns into pure uncertainty and vulnerability upon arriving in Mexico. This doesn't mean she's weak, as I know some will take it, but it simply means that she's indeed human and conflicted. How does she maintain her idea of ethics and moral high-ground when everyone around her is abiding the 'what not to do' section of the unwritten CIA playbook? The film asks us that through many scenes of Kate's blank stares, uncertain remarks, and general uneasiness throughout the film. She's one of the most fascinating and ambiguous characters I've seen all year.Aside from the layered characterization of Kate and Blunt's fascinating performance, Sicario is mostly a showcase for the stylish, limitless directing of Denis Villenueve (responsible for Prisoners, one of 2013's best films) and the masterful cinematography of Roger Deakins, arguably one of the best cinematographers working today alongside Tim Orr and Emmanuel Lubezki. Villenueve makes Mexico a landscape that pulsates with tension and danger, but not in a xenophobic manner, and Deakins captures the sunlit sand and the damaged landscape with an all- encompassing look at how the War on Drugs has left the country in economic and agricultural shambles.With Villenueve and Deakins at the helm, almost nothing else matters, and that's good, because Sicario is a film that benefits from the strength of its three strong components to sort of disguise the fact that the film is a largely unfocused and somewhat disconnected project. No matter how strong the performances are - particularly from Blunt and del Toro, who always has this delightful slowburn quality to most of his performances that doesn't get disguised here - the character relations are surprisingly weak, giving the film a rather cold and unfeeling element. I felt like I was always within arm's length of Sicario, and writer Taylor Sheridan was doing nothing to pull me in whatsoever.Films involving the CIA always seem to emphasize this element; they frustratingly focus on the masculine qualities of these films, no matter how observant they tend to be, and the result is either a cold film with lesser character relations, a piece of flag-waving trite, or a combination of both. Thankfully, some of this is at least attempted to be remedied through Villenueve's direction, which lingers on facial features and expressions in a manner similar to Scott Cooper's constant emphasis on the human face in Black Mass. This allows for some humanity to penetrate an otherwise vacant landscape about as desolate as some of Mexico's rural areas.Sicario, which is clarified as meaning 'hitman' in Spanish, is a strong film aesthetically, but a weaker film structurally. It features the same kind of quips and disconnected elements we've grown accustomed to with films revolving around the CIA, and it unfortunately shortchanges those behind the war itself, on both sides, with the exception of the morally divided Kate. Thankfully, while Sheridan's writing may have been phoned-in to some degree, Villenueve and Deakins' work is anything but textbook-fare.Starring: Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin, Benicio del Toro, and Bernardo P. Saracino. Directed by: Denis Villenueve.",7,2,4,13 October 2015
Pretty Woman," Basic cable entertainment and little else
","Garry Marshall's Pretty Woman is the kind of film that etches itself in the zeitgeist and the contemporary facet of acclaimed romantic comedies for reasons that almost entirely allude me. This is a film that tries to capture the essence of human interest by focusing on a character in an uglier situation than most of her colleagues, who all seemed to get peppier, cuter romantic comedies with more uplifting narratives and occupations. Pretty Woman is a film that is tries to capture a brewing romance in a more difficult situation, but it's too busy searching for the next wickedly transformative, convenient circumstance for its characters and attempting to tie such a difficult situation together so sentimentally to really function as a compelling or original story.It isn't, however, without any merit. Thankfully, despite a rather lackluster narrative that is predictable to a fault, we do get some lively performances that remind us why romantic comedies can occasionally be charming. The most commendable and involved performance of the hour is from Julia Roberts, who plays Vivian Ward, a Hollywood hooker who works the streets with her close friend, rounding up clients and avoiding mistreatment from ruthless pimps in order to try and make whatever money she can in the moment. While she's working late one night, Edward Lewis (Richard Gere), a wealthy businessman, is driving around town lost and in search of Beverly Hills. A simple stop for directions from Vivian turns into him picking her up and having her spend the night at his beautiful apartment suite, where he, in turn, expresses disillusionment over his current place in life following a divorce. With that, we also learn Vivian's rough-go of life and how her existence is now predicated on self-reliance and the resistance to trust anyone.This is a match made in film Heaven; it's questionable if this kind of circumstance would occur on the streets of Hollywood, or anywhere in the United States, but per the rules and logic of Hollywood romantic comedies, plausibility doesn't need to be a contributing factor to the story. This film exists for those who have never lived a day in the life of Vivian to claim how difficult being a stripper must be, and to regard Vivian and Edward's relationship as one that, despite the likelihood of it being doomed in real life, inspires grins and laughs along their way of trying to remain loyal and emotionally honest to one another.As stated, Roberts commands most of her scenes in this film, not only because she is knockout beautiful in both a loud, red dress or more conservative duds, but also because of her ability to be comedic, sarcastic, dramatic, and emotionally convincing, sometimes throughout one whole scene. Gere is a more plain presence, largely because his character is more bent on squarish principles rather than making a splash, as Roberts' Vivian does with many of her scenes. Their chemistry is about as believable as this unbelievable setup could allow for, and thanks to screenwriter J. F. Lawton's recognition of this story's dark roots, turning it into a darker version of Cinderella in some sense, there's at least an added layer of human interest in the film.While Pretty Woman is certainly harmless and easily classifiable as a feel-good movie, it's a film with little merit outside of its leading female performance and a few solid one-liners. The premise, despite being largely predicated off of foreseeable moments of wit, heartbreak, misunderstandings, and miscommunications, feels the need to extend itself shortly past the two hour mark. For a film that doesn't feature enough scenes involving raw emotions being exchanged between Vivian and Edward, nor any real kind of conversations that predicate themselves upon traditional conversation patterns, it sure feels the need to exhaust its plot in a way that alludes to the idea that it does. This is fine, basic-cable entertainment, something it has turned into over the last decade, but simply little more than that.Starring: Richard Gere and Julia Roberts.

The Descent," All they wanted was a vacation
","After watching Neil Marshall's The Descent I seem to have less motivation to go spelunking and get involved in cave exploration. If that's even possible. I hate claustrophobic locations, but love them in films. I've mentioned before the reason I admire them is because due to limitations geographically, the film must work intricately in the fields of progression, character development, and suspense. Suddenly, the neglected things in horror films become the dominant things, and that's the beauty of a film with a limited setting.The Descent left me with an almost incorruptible feeling of sorrow and dread for its characters, so much so, I can safely say the last horror film I was this depressed by was Frank Darabont's The Mist. This is a gloomy, pitiless film focusing on a group of women, lead by thrill-seeker Juno (Mendoza), who go out to explore an unnamed cave that no one has entered before. Juno neglects to mention that part.The reasoning behind the trip is one of the girls, Sarah (Macdonald), lost her husband and young daughter in a collision a year ago, and they want to have a grand adventure, throw caution to the wind, and just take their mind off the depressing events that occurred the previous year. This is where the sentimental part of the film really kicks in. All they wanted was a good time. It reminded me of Open Water (one could dub that a claustrophobic film if they wanted to), a film about a couple who boarded a ship to go diving, hoping to have a fun, enjoyable, and peaceful time. Instead, they were forgotten in the water, and are left without resources in a shark infested sea of despair.I can sympathize and pity characters who were looking for a fun, distracting getaway. It's a bit difficult to do such a thing when the characters are just concerned about getting high and having sex. It's much more sentimental when we see characters trying to escape the monotony of reality, and sincerely wanted to have a good time, but circumstances go beyond sour and they are left fighting for their own lives. It's the strongest example of calamity I can think of.The gang winds up getting trapped in the cave, and are lost, hopeless, and growing weary of the darkness and murkiness of the underground. They discover they aren't the only ones down there, as they find vicious creatures who hunt by sound and movement. Once these beings are presented, the film becomes relentless, as it not only makes its characters lost and wandering, but gives them unknown predators to fear.The film avoids misogyny by actually (a) giving most of the women identifiable traits and (b) portraying them as fighters, not weaklings. Hostel: Part II, a deplorable exercise of snuff and cruelty, portrayed women as helpless mutts with no story to present other than 'we want to party.' Here, these women are strong and capable, as both characters and actresses.Also, for a film set underground, it's beautifully lit. A few years back, I watched James Cameron's Sanctum, which took place deep underground in caves as well. In 3D nonetheless; the absolute last place you'd want to see in a dimmer, more murky area. The film was drab, repetitive, void of substance, and an all around bland experience, mostly because character development was replaced with care and attention to cinematography. The Descent multitasks as Neil Marshall, who also worked on the impressive yet unsung B-movie Dog Soldiers, gives us about forty minutes to get acquainted with these characters. Enough time to form a liking for them, and sympathize when things turn sour.The Descent is a pleasant surprise in the field of horror. It reaches the feeling one doesn't get very often, and that is dread. Scenes are difficult to watch, one comes exactly at the hour mark, and the fear and hopelessness practically bleed through the screen in no time. The ending is again like The Mist; gloomy, disheartening, and full of despair. Not that it's different from the rest of the film. I guess you can say, it stays true to the central tone, and by then, it's perfectly clear what that tone is.Starring: Shauna Macdonald, Natalie Mendoza, Alex Reid, Saskia Mulder, MyAnna Buring, and Nora Jane No one.

Pulp Fiction," Does it look like a film? Then why you try and review it like a film?
","Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is a work of postmodern art. It's unlike any film I've seen before, and because of that, I commend it for not searching for a blueprint or a formula to tell its story. Tarantino tells the story from pure originality, and like many of his future films, Pulp Fiction is told with a non-linear narrative making it hard to explain the plot. It's better to just introduce the characters and go from there.The story is about very different people whose lives intertwine with one another over the course of a few days. The characters first introduced are Pumpkin (Roth) and 'Honey Bunny' (Plummer) who are talking in a dinner with plans to conduct a heist. We then cut to two detectives named Vincent Vega (Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Jackson) who are trying to retrieve a briefcase they can bring to their boss Marsellus Wallace (Rhames).Wallace has his own chapter in the film as well. Him and prizefighter Butch Coolidge (Willis) strike a deal where Butch accepts a large amount of money to throw an upcoming fight. While Wallace is tied up in this deal, Vega goes over to meet and take to dinner the lovely Mrs. Mia Wallace (Thurman). A series of events happen, causing dismay among Vega which lead to some very well-written and well-acted sequences.Being that the film is conducted in a very nontraditional style, Pulp Fiction is a task to follow sometimes. My advice; watch it and just go along with it. If you feel inclined to look up how it played out on the internet go ahead, or if you want to give it a rewatch that is fine too. Viewing multiple clips for a second time, I think I finally understand it more, but a lot of questions you'll still be asking after repeated viewings.One of the most famous questions is 'what's in the briefcase?' that is recovered by Vega and Winnfield in the early scenes of the film. I'm sure when writing the film Tarantino himself didn't know what he wanted to put in the briefcase. I'm also sure he didn't think it would blow up into such a debacle on the message boards and through word of mouth.What truly makes Pulp Fiction worthwhile is the genius dialog. Tarantino cranks out the best script possible combined with enough wit and violence to please the most demanding and picky action-film fan. One moment the two are discussing why a Quarter Pounder With Cheese from McDonalds is called a 'Royale With Cheese' in France. Next, they are threatening violence if a victim asks the question 'what?' again.Why do I not condone constant swearing and gratuitous violence in other films, but for some reason award a perfect score to a film that is made up of it? Because Pulp Fiction shows how it should be done. It depicts realistic situations, handled intelligently and with wit and soul. It doesn't utilize them for the purpose of being monotonous or dreary, but to advance an already crafty storyline. The character are under such stress it only makes sense that they are constantly shouting four letter words. Is it necessary? Not really. But Pulp Fiction isn't just about swearing. It proves that true cinema still exists and that even a story that appears choppy and inconsistent on paper can still produce one of the best films of the decade.Starring: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Maria de Medeiros, Ving Rhames, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Christopher Walken, Bruce Willis, and Quentin Tarantino.

Detroit Rock City," The boys are now in town
","Avant-garde director Adam Rifkin has successfully made a teenage film that shows passion, urgency, and desire all in a believable state. The story of his film Detroit Rock City works because we like these characters even though they are odd and strange outcasts, and because the story's central point of focus, KISS concert tickets, seem to be so easy yet so difficult to obtain. It's a simplistic story made complex because of heavy factors; like age, overprotective moms, and disco Guidos.The four boys are do-it-all Hawk (Furlong), party-boy Lex (Andrews), loudmouth Trip (DeBello), and insecure Jam (Huntington) who love to rock out, work soft, play hard, and smoke marijuana. They have a garage band called 'Mystery' that mirrors the band they idolize, KISS. After much trouble they look to have their eardrums blown off at an upcoming KISS concert, but because of Jam's overbearing mother, the tickets are gone and so are their hopes for the best concert ever.Though by sure luck, Trip calls into a radio show, answers the obligatory KISS question, and wins the four boys four tickets and backstage passes to the same concert. So now, they break Jam out of a boarding school his mother placed him in and are now resuming their plans for the best concert ever.Rifkin clearly knows how to have a fun time. He seems to know how it was to be a teenager who loved sex, drugs, rock and roll, and loud music. All the boys start as cookie cutter stereotypes, but it isn't until the final act of the film where they go off on their own that we see the true side of everyone of them.The fatal mistake Detroit Rock City made back when it was released in 1999; it cut off its main audience. Because of its R rating, used to fully utilize the language and drugs true to the youth, certain High Schoolers who I'm sure mirrored the behavior of the individuals portrayed in the film weren't allowed to see it without a parent. But how could you make a PG-13 Detroit Rock City? I just don't see it.This also occupies one of the best film soundtracks I've heard in quite sometime. Yes, lots of KISS songs are played to amuse the fanboys, but songs like 'The Boys Are Back in Town,' 'Highway to Hell,' 'Iron Man,' 'Jailbreak,' 'Rebel Rebel,' and more are all snuck in. Detroit Rock City doesn't just stoop to the level of all KISS, all the time. I sneaks in other easily recognizable rock tunes to please both the fans of the band and rock fans in general. No assembly of knowledge on KISS is required to enjoy this film. It's a centrist kind of film.Now if only the ending could've been more. I dare not spoil it, but it feels like something was thrown on the cutting room floor too early. It feels vacant, void, and abrupt. Detroit Rock City is an eventful camaraderie of enjoyable characters and amusing events that please the most persistent and choosy buddy comedy fan.Starring: Eddie Furlong, Giuseppe Andrews, James DeBello, and Sam Huntington.

"McFarland, USA"," Informative and heartwarming without being condescending or emotionally manipulative - a mainstream rarity
","Letterboxd/Time Out film critic David Ehrlich has two very keen observations on Niki Caro's new film 'McFarland, USA.' For one, he states that it's another film in the quietly condescending line of films where a white man learns that people of other races are 'capable of being decent,' in an oddly funny but surprisingly true manner, especially with Costner's 'Black or White' still in multiplexes nationwide. And secondly, there's the fact that 'McFarland, USA,' despite being a Disney film about a sport (in this case, cross country), there is not a single training montage whatsoever in the film.Ehrlich, however, overlooked one detail and that's 'McFarland, USA' is the best Disney sports film since 'Remember the Titans.' After last year's crushingly ordinary 'Million Dollar Arm,' Disney rebounds with a film that not only understands its genre and the mental factor that comes into play for a cross country runner, but it understands minority culture very well, in this case, the life of Hispanic adolescents, who have been working in the fields since they were eleven and twelve years old. The film understands their roots, their struggles, and what it means for them to belong to something bigger than themselves, and it portrays such in a manner that isn't empty and emotionally-manipulative but rich with insight and humanity.The film opens with Jim White (Kevin Costner), a hot-headed football coach for a high school team that is getting destroyed at half time. After an outburst leads to a physical altercation with a player, White is dismissed with another blemish on an already tattered record. The only work he can find is in the working poor town of McFarland, California, where he relocates his family. 'Are we in Mexico?,' his teenage daughter asks as they are driving through the streets of McFarland, observing the high volume of Hispanics.Upon relocation, White becomes the Earth science and physical education teacher for McFarland High School. After taking note that a gaggle of the kids in his P.E. class can run at unearthly speeds for multiple laps, he suggests to the already overwhelmed principal of the underfunded school if a cross country team could be implemented. Push comes to shove, compromises are made, and White becomes the one to create a cross country team and seek out seven runners to populate the team. The issue in gathering the faster runners is that many of them are self-proclaimed 'pickers,' or teenagers that spend their mornings out picking crops in the field with the parents, doing exhausting manual labor that, in turn, puts food on their tables. White has to combat this element all while trying to give these kids something to be excited about.The runners steal the show every chance they get, one of whom is Thomas Valles (Carlos Pratts), the team's fastest runner. Valles is a troublemaker, offputting, but greatly troubled by an absent, workaholic father and a family falling apart at the seams. Three other runners are the Diaz brothers, the athletic Damacio (Michael Aguero) and David (Rafael Martinez), and the heavyset Danny (Ramiro Rodriguez), who still bears enough motivation and heart to succeed.I realize I may be summarizing 'McFarland, USA' in what seems to be a posterbook of clichés, but the film's slick handling of tough subjects is anything but shortchanging. Quite frequently does the film shift its focus from Costner's White to the lives of the kids at hand, showing long hours in the picking fields along with stressful homelives that would break most privileged suburban children. These kids are warriors on the track and under their own roof, and the film does nothing but sympathize with their case rather than helplessly pitying them. Writers Christopher Cleveland, Bettina Gilois, and Grant Thompson also make it so it doesn't seem as if White is the 'white knight' for these boys, as the boys recognize such strong, moral values themselves throughout the film and White is simply a vehicle to discovering those, as well.Costner's last film, 'Black or White,' focusing on an ugly legal debate over the custody of Costner's interracial granddaughter, released not even a month ago in the United States, was a lukewarm drama with race as a key factor, but condescending in its portrayal of many of its black characters. 'McFarland, USA' is the complete opposite, filling the adolescent characters with heart, humanity, and a strong sense of character rather than making them sink with their lesser traits.This is a crowd-pleaser of a film if I've ever seen one, and not the kind where the crowd is so pleased they forget to overlook huge issues like emotional manipulation, oversimplification, and blatant sociological flaws in depicting a culture or a group. 'McFarland, USA' is an uncommonly strong film, not so much in its plot and its characters, all of which variations of things seen in the past or just familiar by convention, but there is such a strong depiction of culture and character in the film that that particular element is easy to ignore, given all the greatness on screen so pervasively.",9,13,32,22 February 2015
Les Misérables," I dreamed a lesser dream
","I was advised a day prior to seeing Tom Hooper's Les Misérables to search up and watch the 25th anniversary concert performance of Les Misérables, performed at The O2 in London in October 2010. The performance of three hours was spellbinding, with one lavish song after another captivating even the most distanced viewer with its monumentally talented singers and their brave, audacious vocals. While not a single number was disappointing, Lea Salonga's version of 'I Dreamed a Dream' was simply beautiful and mosaic, without being too emotionally dictative or manipulating. It has the right tone, and Salonga herself didn't appear to be trying to garner anything outside of a wonderful performance.All I can say is that because of enduring a lengthy orchestra, performing the sounds of Victor Hugo's timeless novel, is that Hooper's countless film adaptation suffers by comparison. The story should be familiar now; it's 1815, in a dark and grim France, where convict Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) has been released from prison, yet will still remain under the eye of prison guard Javert (Russell Crowe). After inhabiting a life of crime, Valjean decides to assume a life of good, and we fast-forward nine years later, where he now owns a factory.We soon focus on one of his workers, a young woman named Fantine (Anne Hathaway), who has been sending much of her wages to her illegitimate daughter, Cosette (Isabelle Allen). She is quickly fired after a fight and forced to succumb to losing some of her teeth and her hair just to get the bare minimum to service her daughter, who is living with the Thénardiers (Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter). The remainder of the film centers on the eccentric stories of others in France, during a time of economic uncertainty and political grayness. Everyone is miserable, everyone is dirty, and it seems no one can choose a path for happiness.This is only the umpteenth time this story has been adapted into a film, and who better to do it than Tom Hooper, right? The man directed The King's Speech, a strong, well-made picture which went on to win the 2010 Best Picture Oscar, no competition. Hooper decides to go even more stylistic with Les Misérables than he did that effort, and this is what presents the film with its almost fatal flaw. Hooper directs this picture with a very intimate, yet uncomfortable look, which has long, ponderous close-ups of actors, singing their hearts out to this material. From the first sequence of this, during 'Valjean's Soliloquy,' the videography of the music felt unnatural and slightly awkward. I kept an open mind, believing that it's just the fact I've seen so many musicals that show dancing and atmosphere on a grandscale, only about halfway through when I found this to be a genuine distraction. Occasionally, it comes in handy, like during the 'I Dreamed a Dream' number by Anne Hathaway, which has the audience deeply focused on her as she sings her heart out to one of the saddest ballads in recent memory. But for the most part, it's an unwelcome and very unnatural little feature that sort of sterilizes the emotional effect.It's that and just the way the numerous performers go about their musical numbers, in a heavily bombastic way, that lessen this film as an entire product. I mentioned before that Lea Salonga's rendition of 'I Dreamed a Dream' worked largely in part to the fact that she didn't seem to be trying to garner any sort of recognition, and just did it straight from the soul and left it at that. Hathaway, while presenting her impeccable voice here, with her tears, sadness, and overwhelming misery appears to be trying to get herself an award. Almost everyone in the cast does, including Jackman who plays Valjean well, until his voice must break into song, then he becomes just average. It's pretty damn apparent to anyone with an artistic eye that the actors in this picture were picked based on the merits of their names and not on their true passion and ability to perform the material as effectively as possible. No one does a bad job, but seeing how so many people with smaller names effectively energized the material at hand, one would figure that the bigger names aren't necessarily needed and the name Les Misérables is big enough to which it could sell itself.Yet there are perks here great enough to warrant a recommendation of some sorts. While bombastic and anything but subtle, the musical score is performed efficiently here, the gray backdrops are enough to have the audience suffering in their own misery, and the performances are effective around the clock, including Sacha Baron Cohen, who I fear will go under the radar in yet another spectacular supporting role, on par with the quirky one her gave in Martin Scorsese's Hugo he gave around this time last year.There are several film versions of Les Misérables, none of which I have seen. Hooper's version and the 25th anniversary concert are enough to get me through the next few years, as my thirst has been satisfyingly quenched. Here's a picture that likely because of its cast, crew, name, source material, and period will be a success among audiences and the Academy. As far as an emotional experience goes, I can't say much was done for me in that regard. I'm still backlogged tears after seeing Life of Pi a month ago.Starring: Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, Amanda Seyfried, Eddie Redmayne, Sacha Baron Cohen, and Helena Bonham Carter.

Mystic River," A very teal crime-drama
","Clint Eastwood's Mystic River is a richly crafted picture by a director who has churned out more great films than many new directors probably will in their lifetime. Give the man a script, he'll work wonders, or give the man a camera, and he'll make wonders. His dedicated, sensitive look at human sympathy, grief, and emotion colors in the extensively detailed and professionally acted meat that makes up the entire film. This isn't another lame 'whodunit' drama, but a moving and impressive detective epic.The story focuses on three friends, Jimmy, Sean, and Dave, who grew up in a Boston neighborhood, where they spent their days playing hockey in the streets. One day, they are caught scribbling their names into wet concrete by a man who claims he is a police officer. He manipulates Dave into getting in the back of his car, and it turns out, the man is a child molester who keeps Dave captive for four days before he escapes.Fast-forward about thirty years later, and the men have drifted apart but remain in Boston. Jimmy (Sean Penn) is an ex-convict, with a wife and a nineteen year old daughter named Katie (Emmy Rossum), who he keeps extra close to him, while Dave (Tim Robbins), who too has a wife (Marcia Gay Harden) and son, is still distraught over his molestation and is left a very distant man.When Katie is murdered in cold-blood, their old friend Sean (Kevin Bacon), a local police detective, is hired to investigate, bringing along his partner (Laurence Fishburne). Sean has been long estranged from his wife, who calls frequently only to remain silent on the line.In the mix of this murder, Dave is one of the suspects, returning home from the shooting late at night equipped with a shaky alibi. He claims he can't always recall events perfectly. But the murder of Katie does one thing ostensibly favorable and that is it reunites three long lost friends. They all have lead pretty morose lives in one way or another and seemingly have all left their potential in a cloud of dust behind them.Eastwood, who does not show himself in the film, reminds us that he can still carefully examine characters and show us what they're worth. He paints them with elaborate strokes, ones that leave an impact on the viewer and not ones that are filler and instantaneously disposable. His bitter direction, depicting a cold, murky Boston, often raining and tinted with teal, is sublime and effective.Aesthetically, the film is composed from the ground up on a winning recipe. Penn gives a terrific performance, playing a man who is divided between restoring his life for his daughters and pursuing the life of spur-of-the-moment madness. Robbins is a gifted actor when handed the efficient material and he, just the same, immerses himself in the role of Dave, playing another character torn between sanity and a crippling reality.The film is photographed with eerily picture-esque images by Tom Stern, written with style and depth by Brian Helgeland (working from Dennis Lehane's novel of the same name), and is all captured masterfully under veteran Eastwood's direction. Through all the bitterness, despair, and angst, Mystic River remains a story about complicated human drama, the tedium, yet realism, of criminal investigations that are neither far- fetched or CSI-simple, and how human nature functions as a whole.Starring: Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, Tim Robbins, Laurence Fishburne, Marcia Gay Harden, and Emmy Rossum.

Zombieland," Unexpected zombie surprise
","Zombies are the second thing behind slashers in the Horror genre. Zombies are portrayed as funny, stupid, and brain-eating beasts, but more often scary than funny. This is like Shaun of the Dead in many ways, a funny Zombie Comedy. Director Ruben Fleischer really did a well done job on this. His future work should be impressive Jesse Eisenberg plays one of the few survivors, a dweeby, girl wishing Columbus when a mass virus turns ordinary people into crazed brain lovers. The virus is never explained. Who else but Woody Harrelson plays as Tallahassee. Thats all we need, a kick ass cowboy and a dweeb to save the world. They become friends and team up to rid the world of Zombies in the most ridiculous ways possible (not that there are any not ridiculous ways to kill zombies). They then run into Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Bresling). Sexy and Sly sisters trying to get to Claifornia to go to Pacific Playland where there are said no Zombies.Classical and Rock music are blended to create the perfect mix. The humor is non stop like Harrelson's hunt for a Twinkie. Not to mention a cameo from one of the best 80s movies. Playing a 'zombiebuster' perhaps? Zombieland is perhaps one of the funniest Comedies of the year. Still The Hangover takes the cake for the best.Starring: Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin.

Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," Started on HBO and became a legend
","For those unaware, Tenacious D is a real rock band composed of famed comedy actor Jack Black and his best friend Kyle Gass. The two got their short-lived start on the HBO program of the same name, and now get a film their fans have long been waiting for. Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny might not be what you'd expect from Jack Black. After doing Nacho Libre and School of Rock, two films aimed directly at children, some might not be familiar with Black's dark comedic side. But this makes sure you're well aware and not willing to forget anytime soon.This is a musical comedy. Not quite an in-depth character study on both Black and Gass, but a very vulgar, raunchy, musical comedy with jokes focused around lyrical humor, bongs, and slapsticky elements. Most of them earn a chuckle, but the main humor is the music. Never being properly acquainted to Black and Gass's band, I let myself glide through The Pick of Destiny with no expectations. After the first song, 'Kickapoo,' was played for the beginning sequence I knew the numbers wouldn't let me down.The film begins telling the story of how JB (Black) left his strictly religious family to form the greatest rock band on the planet. He runs into street musician KG (Gass) who begs him to join him in his quest and 'show him his ways' of music. When he finds out KG was trying to trick him, JB is at first upset, but then believes that since KG needs rent money, they could go around and play at certain clubs and such to pay for it.It's simplicity itself, but in a good, cute, harmless way. The film is very vulgar, a trait I was not aware of, but am accepting of. Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny has a love affair with four letter words, especially in the duo's music which is funny yet very juvenile.Jack Black and Kyle Gass have likable chemistry throughout the whole special, and nothing ever feels forced. Clearly, this is a stoner film. How is this made clear? Consider a scene where JB and KG need to face the devil, yes, the devil himself in a rock-off to see who is worthy of The Pick of Destiny. This all comes down to one simple question; would this film have been funnier if I had two friends and a bong handy? The band itself has the spunk and tenacity to carry a film. The script not so much. The music is lively, the characters funny, but the situations are hit or miss. From the box office revenue, this reminded me that it isn't easy to be a satanic, vulgar rock band in this day and age.Starring: Jack Black and Kyle Gass.

The Witch," If Jesus couldn't save himself, what makes you think he's gonna save you?
","First-time writer/director Robert Eggers has had quite a ride with his debut film 'The Witch,' earning the respect and endorsement from the Sundance Film Festival, the majority of American critics, and even the Satanic Church. His film is meant to be both an homage and an ode to New England folktales and fairy tales centering around witchcraft and the supernatural. Most of the film's dialog and structure came from folktales from over two-hundred years ago, as stated in the film's end credits, and the look and feel of the film is remarkably 17th century, right down to the environments Eggers utilizes.If nothing else, 'The Witch' is destined to be one of the most aesthetically refined and remarkable films of the year, let alone most beautifully shot horror film of the year. Cinematographer Jarin Blaschke emphasizes the eeriness of the deep-wooded New England plantations, with precise focus on the location-swallowing fog and the overcast skies. As dreary and as miserable as the film looks, it's also immersive in the regard that it clearly plunges you into a different world; one you haven't been familiar with in horror films in quite sometime. Every year, we're almost guaranteed to get a Gothic-style, Victorian-era film that emphasizes lush scenery and immaculate cinematography, but rarely do the visual conventions of 17th century folk intersect with contemporary horror. In that respect, 'The Witch' is a novel concept that sets itself up for noteworthiness on the basis of its locational possibilities alone.Before I get any more carried away than I already have, the plot must be introduced. Set in the aforementioned century, the story revolves around a traditionalist, god-fearing family led by William (Ralph Ineson), the intensely religious patriarch. His family consists of his wife Katherine (Kate Dickie), his eldest daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), his son Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), and his young twins Mercy and Jonas (Ellie Grainger and Lucas Dawson). The family leaves their old land to start a new life on a farm, where Katherine gives birth to her fifth child, which is subsequently abducted by a witch before being sacrificed.This starts an unrelenting curse on this family that works to destroy it by going after its most innocent and helpless individuals, the children. Eventually, Caleb winds up becoming the witch's next victim, as a controlling and possessed spirit enters his body and begins to overtake him, all while the family is grieving over the loss of their newborn. Meanwhile, William and Katherine find themselves considering sending Thomasin into an arranged marriage now that she is becoming older, and seeing as she's proved herself in capable to take care of her younger siblings.As one can see, 'The Witch' is very much a family drama, with psychological and supernatural horror ingredients injected into the film's premise to add the unsettling undertones. Unfortunately, 'The Witch' gets its atmosphere down to a tee so well that it forgets to make a story that's as creepy as it sets itself up to be, let alone moving or worthwhile. Despite such wonderful, gloomy settings, the film never becomes very creepy or interesting enough for audiences to care. Everything, from the characters' personalities to their religious guidance, feels within arm's reach of us, and while the authentic, period-specific dialog is a commendable element, it only works to further distance people from the film's themes.This is truly a shame because I appreciate what 'The Witch' sets up: a family rooted in deeply traditionalist, religious doctrine that is slowly finding out that Jesus, God, or any other kind of figure from their Bible cannot save them from the evil and sin that runs amok in the world. The idea that Jesus couldn't save himself is one that's hard enough to grasp, but what happens when one realizes that, because of that, he cannot save him or her either? William, played very well by Ineson, who goes for assertive and unnerving here, has the hardest time grappling with this idea as he watches his family crumble before his eyes.With that being said, watching 'The Witch' can be a frustrating experience just because of how lifeless it often is. The level of character interest doesn't come anywhere close to the interest level of the film's setting, and as a result, there's little to connect to or embrace. It wasn't until about the hour mark that I truly felt conflicted as a viewer; here's a film with a biting, interesting premise and themes that's weighed down, not only by its esoteric approach, but also by its lack of legitimate creepiness until the last twenty minutes.'The Witch' doesn't flatline entirely like 'The Forest' or other horror films of recent years, particularly ones neutered in content and approach to attract a younger crowd, but it doesn't titillate or excite like 'It Follows' or 'The Sacrament,' both films with similar premises, strong themes, but far more accessible characters and consistently interesting setups. Some will claim my soft dislike for 'The Witch' comes from my lack of tolerance for slowburn horror, but consistent readers of my work know I hold slowburn horror near and dear to my heart and vastly prefer it over the tropes that have become commonplace in contemporary, American horror. The problem with 'The Witch,' at the end of it all, isn't its pace, it's the paces it takes in the wrong direction.",6,2,8,20 February 2016
The Holiday," A smart, wry romantic comedy for a bit more demanding viewers
","Screenwriter/director Nancy Meyers continues to defy all romantic comedy conventions by doing a few things that are often missed by screenwriters of the genre. Instead of focusing on incredulous romances and meet-cutes, Meyers is quick to focus on the characters involved in these on-screen relationships, developing them by closely following their mannerisms before they become involved in the film's core romances. Secondly, she places emphasis on the dialog of the characters while they are in these relationships, rather than their actions, and even if circumstantial incredulity comes into play, you almost miss it because Meyers crafts such likable on-screen presences that it isn't so blatantly obvious that they are saying and doing things that are a bit too playful with narrative conveniences. Finally, the emphasis on conversation and character relationships helps Meyers naturally include humor and wittiness to a screenplay that would otherwise try too hard to be funny or relevant.The end result is The Holiday, a very natural romantic comedy, with a quartet of strong performers and a story that takes its time to build over the course of two hours. Interestingly enough, most romantic comedies exhaust themselves past the one-hundred minute mark, but The Holiday defies convention by taking a liberal amount of time to illustrate two brewing romances on opposite sides of the world that all began because of adventurous feelings by two introverts.The film opens by introducing two characters, Iris Simpkins (Kate Winslet), a column editor for a newspaper in London and Amanda Woods (Cameron Diaz), a movie trailer producer in Los Angeles. Iris has been in love with her coworker Jasper Bloom (Rufus Sewell) for over three years, despite him cheating on her when they were dating and that her love has gone unrequited. Iris winds up becoming more upset when she learns Jasper is engaged and she, well into her thirties, is still single. Amanda, however, has been a workaholic since the startup of her company, and the result has taken a toll on her live-in boyfriend (Edward Burns), who packs up and moves out after he reveals she has been cheating on her.Both women are in need of a vacation, and upon discovering one another on a chat-room, they agree to a 'house swap,' where Iris will go live in Amanda's spacious, Los Angeles mansion and Amanda will live in Iris' small London cottage over the course of the holiday season. During her stay in Los Angeles, Iris meets an elderly man named Arthur Abbott (Eli Wallach), who was once a screenwriter during the Golden Age of Hollywood, in addition to Miles (Jack Black), a charming employee of Amanda's who has an obsession with films scores. Meanwhile in London, after initially slugging away at wine and holiday snacks, a drunk Amanda winds up meeting Iris' brother Graham (Jude Law) when he, also drunk, knocks on her door one night expecting Iris. The two commit to having a one-night stand, but when they realize their dynamic and chemistry is something neither of them can deny, the morning after becomes that much more complicated, especially when Graham allows Amanda to meet his kids.The Holiday ostensibly sets itself up for immediate failure by focusing on two separate romances. That narrative structure is a constant problem with romance films because they struggle in trying to humanize and develop both relationships under a reasonable amount of time. For Meyers, time never seems to be a factor; she starts liberally, by revealing more about the characters through their mannerisms and their choices rather than by with whom they interact before inviting the love-interest into the picture. By including characters like Amanda's ex-boyfriend and Wallach's ex-screenwriter character, Meyers also shows that she has more on her mind than simply cranking out a dime-a-dozen love story. She wants to populate a film with characters that simultaneously mean something and fill a film with a great deal of entertainment value.The result is a film that's breezily paced, but never fluffed, remarkably charming, but never saccharine, and humbly emotional, and never manipulative. This is largely thanks to Meyers' screen writing, but also thanks to the talented cast of performers, specifically Winslet and Black who are trying to break out of their own character archetypes throughout the entire film. Consider Winslet's character, who could easily be a faceless, mopey spinster. Instead, Winslet is a deeply sympathetic character because she's not dysfunctional nor is she a comical trainwreck. Consider the scene where Iris is beside herself, talking with Miles about the perils and the unrelenting sadness of unrequited love and it how strips not just a piece, but several pieces, from your ability to love, trust, and sympathize with people. It's a truly sad monologue that Meyers wisely doesn't choose to milk for tears, but rather, pure, unadulterated honesty.Meanwhile, Black gives a performance that is perhaps his most delightful mixed of controlled chaos yet. While he is more restrained and casual here, his zealous, roly-poly tendencies sneak in on various occasions, particularly the video store scene where he brilliant recites harmonies and melodies of film scores. Cameron Diaz and Jude Law serve as the more predictable couple, though that's not a bad thing, for they are the narrative anchor that keeps the film from taking off into another world. You're bound to have a preferred couple watching The Holiday, and for me, the insights and the consistent charm of both Winslet and Black's characters was an instant winner for me.With all that in mind, The Holiday works as a very lovable piece of entertainment, and furthers Nancy Meyers' status as one of the smartest female directors working in the business today. Her careful craft when it comes to assembling a romantic comedy is shown with every character in the film, and rather than cluttering Holiday with useless caricatures or sticking to a basic love quartet, she surprises on multiple levels, effectively giving most audience members more than they expected.",8,1,1,17 February 2016
Zero Dark Thirty," Important, yet heavy, meandering, and somewhat vacuous
","Kathryn Bigelow's Zero Dark Thirty derives its title from clever spy language meaning half past an unspecified time after midnight, or the time when Seal Team Six finally killed known terrorist and Al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden. The film she has made only devotes about twenty-five minutes to that time period, which is a wise choice from her standpoint and screenwriter Mark Boal's. The remaining two hours leading up to that shows how the CIA finally got there, after numerous leads, little evidence, and a brave woman who went against their original ideas.A large majority of the CIA believed that Osama Bin Laden was hiding in a remote cave, some miles away from the cities of Pakistan, and was sick and ailing. After a ten year manhunt, we finally found him, hiding in a large, heavily-walled compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, not far away from a military college. And now we have a film glorifying and boasting our efforts. I was off-put by this idea, despite my positivity towards Bigelow and Boal's previous effort, The Hurt Locker. The whole concept seemed to be rather narcissistic and overly patriotic on the United States' part.Thankfully, the film actually has a brain in its head and substance in mind. The story's shell is kept simple, yet the interworkings are much to complex and to keep things safe, I'll do some oversimplifying. We open with a collection of 911 calls from that faithful day twelve years ago that, I believe, needs no introduction. We cut to scenes set at the U.S. embassy in Pakistan, where Maya, played by the wonderful Jessica Chastain, accompanies Dan (Jason Clarke) during 'enhanced interrogations,' basically meaning that they involve tortuous methods. All the torture and endless questions are attempting to lead up to the whereabouts of Osama Bin Laden, and as the film goes on, we see how Maya climbs the social ladder of the CIA, to even going boldly against the word of the top representatives (Joel Edgerton) about where exactly he is hiding. After spotting a shady, plain white compound in the middle of Pakistan, with black windows and no third male living in a house with various females, Maya is 100% convinced that Bin Laden is residing in that large area, while the CIA clings to their idea that he is out in some cave in the middle of nowhere. They pragmatically believe that if not Bin Laden living there it is someone who clearly is evading the law, like a drug dealer.The film works around this plot for about one-hundred and twenty five minutes, leaving the last act to center around the raid of the compound that has the outcome everyone is aware of. Bigelow still maintains the ability to surprise her audience in some sequences, mainly the Marriott Hotel bombing and the Camp Chapman attack. She concocts this very uncertain atmosphere in many of the instances when two characters meet to discuss a detail or an operation that works in the film's favor. The CIA dialog we are presented with is hit and miss. Some scenes, involving Maya talking with the analyst Steve (Mark Duplass, one of my favorite actors working today) are captured with the driest of wit, while others, show Maya desperately convincing several people in the organization she is right through polite conversation or shouting matches, become a tad overbearing and plod along with heavy jargon and a meandering focus.The the grand difference between Zero Dark Thirty and Bigelow's Oscar winning Hurt Locker is the unfocused narrative. The Hurt Locker was about the deteriorating sanity of an Iraqi war veteran shown in a deep, intimate character study through a sensitive lens, which won me and a lot of others over. Zero Dark Thirty bears more weight and spans the course of a decade, making for a lot more material and a lot more events that Bigelow and Boal clearly struggle to capture. This causes some events to be more interesting and others to be only mildly amusing.Much has been made about the fact that this film depicts instances of torture from a seemingly slanted perspective The torture sequences aren't much to blow out of proportions but the fact that they are close to what really happens. I'm not sure this film is partisan in any regard, and while it subtly states the reason why we knew where Bin Laden was located was because of a message obtained through waterboarding, another scene shows its occasional ineffectiveness by having a man scream various days when asked about when a bombing will take placed. It's a very original, even-handed approach. Zero Dark Thirty is a film I'd still call important for its deep depiction of one of the largest manhunts in history, yet to call it a masterwork or even hold it up on a pedestal as one of the greatest espionage films of all time is strictly an overstatement. The film is tricky, informative, and occasionally entertaining, yet it's heavy, meandering, and shortchanging in the regards of characters. This can become a difficult thing to tolerate when the whole film is watching characters interact with others when morally just decisions are on the line or soon being proposed.Read the more complete review at http://stevethemovieman.proboards.com",7,1,7,13 January 2013
Steve Jobs," Indecent and gifted
","For a mainstream film about a technological titan, Danny Boyle's 'Steve Jobs' is immensely subversive in the way that it rejects biopic convention to give us the parts of Jobs's story I'm sure many of us wouldn't have put near the top of our lists to see. The film focuses on the behind-the-scenes interworkings of three specific press conferences Jobs delivered: the first is the unveiling of the original Macintosh computer following an electrifying Super Bowl commercial in 1984, the second is the announcement of the NeXT Box, the debut hardware from Jobs's own company NeXT in 1988, and the final is the reveal of Jobs's iMac computer in 1998, after Jobs is rehired by Apple. Just as Jobs is about to stand before the crowd to give his press conferences, Boyle's camera cuts and Sorkin's script deviates to a transitory scene that takes place in the middle of the sequence we just watched and the sequence we're about to see.What should've made for a disjointed and unnerving film instead creates a symphonic blend of sharp dialog, terrific character acting, and intimate character development and relations behind one of the most recognized names in the technology field. Michael Fassbender plays Steve Jobs, a wickedly smart but frequently condescending man, uncaring of what people think of him so long as he gets his vision out to the public. He's assisted, morally guided, and somewhat kept in line by his marketing adviser Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet), especially when his daughter Lisa gets caught up in a brutal battle of paternity denial. Lisa's mother finds this a deplorable act of cowardice on Jobs' behalf; he finds it a setback and an attempt to devalue his name and career.Boyle and writer Aaron Sorkin also show Jobs' relationship with Apple CEO John Scully (Jeff Daniels), who seems to always be on the opposite page of Jobs no matter the issue. Scully is a marketing and business traditionalist, ultimately concerned with promotion and the bottom dollar, where Jobs believes that innovation and creating something people didn't know they wanted should be the fundamental goal of a technology empire (in one brilliant scene, Jobs states, 'the person who said 'the customer is always right' was almost certainly a customer'). Finally, there's the long-developed and discussed relationship between Jobs and his college buddy Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen), who surprisingly takes a backseat to much of the action, only turning up to knock Jobs off his high-horse by reminding him that, despite him commanding the orchestra, he doesn't know how to make any of the parts move nor does he really do anything other than dictate and belittle.I'm sure there were few people thinking Sorkin's screenplay for 'Steve Jobs' wouldn't be top-notch, but I'm not sure many expected how sharp and biting the dialog of this film was going to be. Rather than focusing on capturing every noteworthy event of Jobs' life in a concise, completionist manner like the forgotten 'Jobs' biopic two years ago, Sorkin focuses on the conversations between the people that made them happen. The dialog here is always alive, turning a two hour film into one that races past at lightning speed - something I don't say often.But Sorkin's dialog would be of little merit if it wasn't recited by the immensely talented cast this film boasts. The supporting performances here are the kind of performances that transcend the power of the lesser characters in a film, and Jeff Daniels and Kate Winslet truly capitalize off of the power of their characters. Daniels works to make every line of dialog he says level-headed and understandable from his perspective, and Winslet, who ostensibly gets a very thankless role, turns her character into an undeniable force and commendable female supporting role. Winslet is as good as Fassbender, who ultimately is the beating heart of this film. Fassbender's ability to be as mesmerizing in his smugness and his confidence is what keeps this film watchable, in addition to his ability to be so interesting as he condescends people, using elaborate but believable dialog appropriate for a variety of situations. The only one who seems out of place here is indeed Rogen, who always looks and seems to feel like he's about to make some kind of a joke or a quip in every scene he's in.Yet, 'Steve Jobs' is a powerful and titillating film, proving my notion that films that dedicate themselves to profiling a character through dialog and his relations with others can be just as gripping as any action film you can name. This also serves as a cogent reminder to those who emptily praise Jobs without really understanding his character or his accomplishments. Political commentator and pundit Bill Maher pointed out an interesting note on this film, assuming it would be successful like many other biopics about cut-throat people of success, because America has a love for 'a**holes.' I don't disagree, but this film should be regarded like 'The Wolf of Wall Street' in a way where neither the director or writer of the film actively condemns the titular figure, and instead simply allow for his actions to condemn and define himself before audiences.",10,2,7,24 October 2015
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," To infinity and above expectations
","Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist has a lot more life than one would expect. It seems like a stock rom com, but when you dive into it you'll likely see it is sure to impress in the field of characters, events, and style. It is almost like an eighties film in present day. It takes place all in one night, similar to American Graffiti, and has a certain retro quality about it.Michael Cera plays the same character that he plays throughout his entire filmography which is certainly not a bad thing. I say if you're really good at doing a certain character, keep doing it. Cera plays a good sweet and innocent boy in everything he does. In Juno he was great and same with Superbad. Kat Dennings, who looks like a younger version of the Survivor winner Parvati Shallow, is a little new in this one, but she does a great job because of her 'born this way' attitude. She's very independent and very calm most of the movie.The plot involves depressed and lonely Nick (Cera) who plays for a band called 'The Jerk-Offs' being suddenly paired up with this girl and before they know it they are on the search for their favorite band called 'Where's Fluffy.' The girl is Norah (Dennings), a good friend of the girl who recently dumped Nick, Tris (Dzeina).Also looking for the band are the rest of 'The Jerk-Offs) played by Aaron Yoo and Ravi Gavron. Nick and Norah are first in search of Norah's drunk girlfriend Caroling (Graynor), but assuming she's in good hands, go out to hunt for the band.The plot is sweet, but not execute very well. It portrays New York too safely. The characters never seem to be in any danger even though they are driving through some of the scummiest sidestreets in the city in a Yugo getting mistaken at various points for a cab. Also, I must ask this simple question, where the hell are the parents? With all the aside, it manages to pull through and not have all the characters play the roles they should. It's almost as if screenwriter Lorene Scafaria actually knew Nick and Norah and this is a biography. The characters don't seem forced or idiotic. They seem like pretty normal high school students.With a pretty poor trailer and an odd marketing campaign, it seemed the only thing Nick and Norah had going for it was the soundtrack. Thankfully it isn't a one note comedy and actually manages to make itself better than a lot of twenty first century comedies. It's harmless and original. Two qualities movies of its genre should all be.Starring: Michael Cera, Kat Dennings, Aaron Yoo, Alexis Dziena, Ari Graynor, Aaron Yoo, and Jay Baruchel.

There Will Be Blood," Greed vs. morality, one winner, place your bets
","Find the more complete and elaborate review in the 'external reviews' section under 'The Steve Pulaski Message Board.'The opening scene of Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood focuses on rebelling against the conventions of verbocentrism, which places dialog and conversation in the forefront of what is occurring on screen. As a result, it places most of its emphasis on the delightful musicality of the environment into which we are plunged. The effect is minimalist and unsettling, as we, the audience, are somewhat used to information dumps in the openings of films, where we're given background information on characters and situations. There Will Be Blood focuses on the sounds of this region and, in turn, creates a decided emphasis on brief sounds that interject themselves in the mix of long term silence.The film revolves around Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis), an ambitious prospector at the turn of the 1900's, working to turn a small Californian village into an industrialized boomtown by constructing an enormous and profitable oil rig to assure financial security for him and his young boy. The only soul that somewhat stands in his way for making that a reality is Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), who owns the land in the location of which he is mining in. Eli is a theatrical pastor for a church, where he is renowned in the community for extracting the devil from the souls of people.Because the characters of Daniel and Eli are often very thinly developed, known only by the descriptions of a select few adjectives, one is more inclined to view them allegorically than as characters, even though we spend over two and a half hours with them. There Will Be Blood largely positions itself to be a big parable on the prolonged result of greed and self-interest in American capitalist business, a certain pessimistic inevitability, as this film views it as. In that case, Daniel is clearly representative of the greed side where he'll do anything to make a quick buck, as many of us, ourselves, can perhaps recall doing. His desperation is almost cloaked because of his unbridled ambition and persistency, even when almost irreparable drawbacks come in his way, such as a catastrophic explosion of one of his oil rigs.With that, Eli comes with the dual side of the capitalist business, which is religion or morality, specifically personal integrity. Whether or not Eli, himself, is an ethical and honest pastor is moot; he represents the morally just, ethical, and fair part many capitalist businessmen claim to incorporate in their business decisions, though the end result results in largely questionable accounts for how much ethics played apart into such a decision. Throughout the film, the two sides pose an intriguing dichotomy that, in turn, makes up the larger part of American business - the constant struggle to remain profitable, ambitious, and ever-changing whilst choosing to stick to, or simply refuse, the guidance via a moral compass.Moreover, Anderson, and the immensely talented crew in the sound editing department, clearly present themselves as a fan of layered sound, juggling various audiotracks at once. This, in turn, provides the audience with a cacophony to go along with the visual decadence.The soundtrack enhances the film greatly, speaking from a musical perspective, largely because it's not concerned with cheap pathos nor affirmation of the occurrences on screen, but because it adds to the film so nonchalantly that you might even forget it's there. Consider the scene where Daniel rides horseback and scouts the endless amounts of pure virgin land that he wants to use for another unionized oil rigging pipeline. During this montage, the score is more playful than it ever has been, playing layered and eclectic sounds that match the events on screen because, much like they are, it's bouncy and moves incredibly quickly. It almost makes you, if for a moment, forget how immersive Robert Elswit's cinematography is throughout the entire film, as it's most captured with beautiful wide-angles that soak in the luscious, if desolate, Californian scenery.Finally, there are the equally unforgettable aspects of the performances, particularly by Day-Lewis, who proves his ability to emerge from being a total recluse in the often public eye of Hollywood, take a curiously layered role filled with intrigue and human complexities, knock it out of the park on every level, and quickly descend into the realm of obscurity from which he emerged. Anderson gives Day-Lewis the best material to work with in terms of being a direct, yet ambiguous, character, and there's Day-Lewis unbelievably natural talent of method acting. Words almost fail to describe and accurately pinpoint how convincing he is; you simply need to witness it.But that doesn't mean Paul Dano's work should go unnoticed either. Dano is an actor that, for years, to this day, has been involved in fascinating, low-key films that emphasize character-weirdness and emotionally complexities and vapidness all in one role, and it's criminal to see him never get Academy Award-level recognition for any of his work. To hold your ground alongside arguably the greatest, most involved actor of this generation is no easy thing to do, and the fact Dano, somebody who is far from a household name in American cinema, does so in a manner that channels Day-Lewis's level of conviction in a surprisingly strong manner is astonishing.At two and half hours, it's easy to miss all that There Will Be Blood has to offer, though I think I can break down the basics fairly easily. The film gets us to analyze the often dichotomous relationship between devout faith and gritty business that places itself precariously on the idea of American capitalist business and, through the use of sound and cinematography, keeps the audience in an discomforting position as it proposes discomforting questions and points.",9,0,1,20 October 2015
Burlesque," Burlesque: The Edited, PG-13 Look Inside the Lounge
","Burlesque is not a film for all audiences, and I'm willing to bet I'm the only fourteen year old who expressed an ounce of interest for this film. It's a musical/dance number that is constructed much like the 2002 hit Chicago. Beautiful women, catchy score, and a very involving story line. While 2010 has certainly offered better, if no musical comes out that's surpasses this one, I can easily say that 'Burlesque' is the best musical of this year.Cher, in the music world, is outstanding. Cher, in the film world, isn't so hot. She's done some winners and some losers like many actors/actresses, but it seems her filmography is always underrated and shed away compared to her discography. This is the first time I've seen Cher in a film since Stuck on You in 2003. I have been known to like her and enjoy her music. Burlesque shows off her inner talent and your eyes will be glues to her every time she steps onto the screen. Something about her voice, passion, (plastic) face, and apparel makes her an immediate site of attraction. I will also say that Welcome to Burlesque is my favorite song in this film as well.The story follows Ali (Xtina) who escapes her life at a local dinner to head to Los Angeles to find herself at the Burlesque Lounge where she winds up meeting the club's firm but fair headliner Tess (Cher). As events go on, Ali impresses Tess with her strong voice and high passion for singing and makes her part of the dancing team. Ali finally gets the break she's been waiting for when she can express herself and show the Burlesque Lounge what she's made of.Unfortunately, the club is ailing and the future is looking so high, but with Cher running the club anything can happen. While it's the cliché 'showing people your true talent' scheme it's shown to us in a very musical style which is something I don't see too often. I'd see this five times before I sit in the theater for Country Strong.The score for Burlesque completes the film. No song is truly memorable, but for the film both Cher and Xtina provide some impressive vocals, especially Cher who has some dark/eerie singing abilities. Too bad most of the songs are occupied by the young blood rather than the pioneer. Xtina does a fine job at acting, but Cher was the true highlight/standout of the film.Burlesque runs one minute shy of two hours, which for a musical is a bit lengthy, especially when the overall story isn't utilized to the fullest. I'd have like to see more of the girl's lives outside of Burlesque rather than see Xtina so much. It's nothing I'd watch/buy on DVD, but Burlesque proves to be more than the trailers show. It's a decent movie to wrap up Thanksgiving, but definitely not a film for everyone. The Sound of Music fans may be disappointed. Chicago fans might appreciate it.Starring: Cher, Christina Aguilera, Eric Dane, Cam Gigandet, and Julianne Hough. Directed by: Steve Antin.",8,6,13,27 November 2010
To Kill a Mockingbird," Probably the most worthy book to movie adaptation
","Gregory Peck portrays Atticus Finch in the movie adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird. A role in which he won an Oscar for. Highly deserving because his role in this film is not only packed full of responsibility and loyalty, but he portrays one of the most iconic book characters of all time. To Kill a Mockingbird is considered a literature classic. It was written by Harper Lee, and published in 1960 with this film to follow two years later.The book is almost an essential read to high schools across America. Much like Atlas Shrugged being a popular read in College. It is a well developed, honest coming of age book about three youths growing up in the racially divided town of Maycomb, Alabama. It captures the time where blacks were equal, but not treated like it. They were still left out and treated unfairly. This is depicted well in the court scene of the movie. But unfortunately it isn't depicted as deeply as the book.The film leaves out a lot of emotion from the crowd and jury in the court scene. Atticus is defending Tom Robinson after being accused of raping a young woman named Mayella Ewell. Her father is the despicably nasty Robert Ewell who is not only extremely racist, but an abusive drunk who thinks he is doing the town a favor by wrongfully convicting a black man but really just causing more notoriety to a town not deserving.The emotion in the courtroom was empty. It should've at least focused on more people rather than Jem, Scout, and Dill. As you can see, I'm not making an effort to state the plot because I feel people reading this have read or seen the film. If not, a short quick character analysis will do no harm.Aside from that, the film is delightful and colorful even in it's black and white state. It still has a charm that newer books lack. Reading the book for the first time in my Freshman English class felt very fitting because not only did I want to read the book, I felt I needed to read the book. I contemplated a book review, but I felt a film review was more up my ally.Some kids despise the book for it's small print, thick stature, slow start, and text marking, but you're doing it for a good reason. It is not an easy read. It can be complex and left for the reader to imply some events. But it also gives you the freedom to be more involved with a novel. Harper Lee doesn't tell you what happens, she wants you to figure out what happens.In the early stages of the book and the movie the children's fascination stems from a creepy old house down the road. The house belongs to Arthur 'Boo' Radley. Nicknamed because of his unknown personality and rare appearances, the children make up stories and try to assume what goes on in that shack. He is almost shunned out like he is a black man in a town of whites.It's not until soon after Atticus discovers the kid's fascination with the house that he utters a very meaningful and memorable quote; 'You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view - until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.' That quote, along with many others, makes To Kill a Mockingbird a wonderful book, a thorough movie adaptation, and a great story.Starring: Gregory Peck, Mary Badham, Phillip Alford, and Robert Duvall. Directed by: Robert Mulligan.",9,0,1,17 April 2011
Pitch Perfect 2," Characters with personality encapsulated in a film that has enough of its own to effectively capture it
","The original 'Pitch Perfect' was, by any definition, a surprise hit; I think it's fair to claim nobody expected a film about a group of female a capella singers to be a box office smash that left a cultural footprint on the new generation of teenage girls. It combined the wry relatability of a film like 'Mean Girls' and etched in pop/music-influenced energy to create something that was decidedly unique and realized and wound up creating its own eclectic fanbase. On the contrary, I don't think anybody expected there not to be a sequel to the film, and for that film to try and mimic what made the first film so loved.Aside from a few stumbling attempts to keep up with its own absurdity, and some seriously questionable cultural jokes, 'Pitch Perfect 2' continues to exploit its own harmony and run with it to notable success. This time around, we are reacquainted with the Bellas, the renowned, award-winning a capella group led by Becca (Anna Kendrick) and Chloe (Brittany Snow). Following an incident involving the klutzy Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) and an unforeseeable wardrobe malfunction in front of President Barack Obama and the First Lady, the Bellas are suspended from competing in any competition. In order to regain their domestic status, the group tries to perform on the international circuit, which has never seen an American a capella group compete in history.A few years ago, this would've been little sweat for the barrage of talented ladies. However, most of the Bellas are graduating this year, quietly forgetting what has kept them together for so long. Moreover, the only one who appears worried about her future is Becca, who has been skipping out on many rehearsals and practices to advance her lowly status at a record company. She dreams of being a music producer, but has to work around her hard-headed (but hilarious) boss (Keegan-Michael Key), leaving the Bellas without a great deal of organization in the meantime. The group also welcomes a new face named Emily (Hailee Steinfeld), who is known for her 'legacy' status thanks to her extremely talented mother, who was a Bella during her days at Barden University. This massive competitive undertaking mixed with a serious group identity crisis leaves the Bellas without a lot of options in terms of getting their name back on top.Before we can appreciate what 'Pitch Perfect 2' does fairly well, we have to recognize a couple of glaring issues that few seem to be talking about, one of which is the obvious cultural and racial insensitivity on display. There is a Guatemalan character in the film known as Flo (Chrissie Fit), who is a character that is thrown in the Bellas to do nothing other than confirm the common prejudices and stereotypes of Hispanic/South American individuals. Every time she speaks, she attributes some sort of stereotype to her own life, whether it be being kidnapped or having to change her identity and flee the country. The jokes are abrupt tonal shifts from what is otherwise light-hearted fun. In addition, even the blatantly sexist John (John Michael Higgins), one-half of the two announcers in the film who cover the a cappella competitions, has transcended from being simple and effective comic relief to thoroughly mean-spirited and misogynistic. I speak not as an offended viewer, but more as one questioning why many are so quick to just brush off casual racism in comedies when they condemn the same actions in real life (the same question I had when I saw 'Get Hard').'Pitch Perfect 2' is damn lucky to have an exceptional team of cinematographers, sound editors, sound mixers, costume designers, set decorators, and choreographers to assure that questionable humor and mean-spiritedness don't overtake the project's inherent charm. Despite all the distractions, one can't deny the theatrical power of both this film and its sequel. The glitz, glamor, and beautiful decor of the sets and stages are a feast for the eyes, and never does the a capella aspect get lost in the shuffle. These films are both incomparable collections of talent that simultaneously don't feel like any kind of marketing campaign for a capella organizations, which is a tricky dance to pull off in many cases.The only other time 'Pitch Perfect 2' sidesteps is when its coolness gets the best of it. Both films have consistently tried to be hip with the characters' lingo, mannerisms, and actions, and, most of the time, they because of how the talented actresses handle it, but it's silly scenes like Fat Amy 'rubbing her confidence (aka sweat)' on Becca that work to derail such added charm. These kinds of scenes work paradoxically to the film, which tries to be more adult and less Disney (it comes with a PG-13 rating that should strongly be noted by parents of kids eleven and younger) most of the time, but can't help but throw in some element of childishness in the mix.Nonetheless, first-time feature-film director Elizabeth Banks (who shows up alongside Higgins once again in the film) takes a lofty challenge with 'Pitch Perfect 2' and succeeds in making it a visual spectacle and something of an emotional one to boot. By the end, we realize how much time we've spent with these characters, even if it doesn't seem like that much, and we recognize their talents and their personalities, and find ourselves falling in love with their attitudes, their singing, and their talent all over again. That's the beauty of these films, through the occasional bouts of nonsense and ridiculous jokes; these are characters with a great deal of personality encapsulated in a film that has enough of its own to effectively capture it.",7,10,19,15 May 2015
Whiplash," Blood, sweat, and bangs
","Damien Chazelle's 'Whiplash' is a film that left me breathless and physically exhausted when I got up to walk out of the theater, and all I had done for the past hour and forty minutes was lounge in a theater recliner and watch somebody else work themselves into a sweaty mess. A good film about motivation and determination leaves you humbled, but a great film about the same subjects leaves you emotionally drained and even enraged; enraged from watching others bring the lead character down and even attempt to compromise his or her dreams. The film may even leave you determined to exercise your own dreams out to a fuller extent, not compromising your talents or adhering to requirements, and realizing what makes you happy may not make others happy, but those others aren't you or likely sleeping in the same bed as you.'Whiplash' is a contemplative film in that regard; a film that earns every word of praise and every glowing adjective on its theatrical poster and the many accolades it has received. It's a film that gives you the heartbreak of perceived failure and allows you to be affected by the few words of praise the lead character receives as well as every negative drawback and vulgar criticism (and there are plenty here). The film concerns Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller), a nineteen-year-old first year student at Shaffer Conservatory, a prestigious music school. Andrew is a drummer, but not your typical 'I'm in a band drummer;' his goal is to go down as one of the greatest drummers who ever lived, etching himself alongside Buddy Rich and Charlie Parker. At first, we, the audience, may sneer at his dreams, but it's cool; Andrew couldn't care less. When we see him practice until his hands are calloused and bleeding excessively from the tight grip of his drumsticks is when we see his determination is real. When we see him tear through his drumset, banging his sticks angrily on his symbols and throwing his kit across the stage is when we truly realize his drive to be the best he can be.Andrew's entire world is tested when he meets Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), an uncommonly strict music teacher, who has no problem making his classmates stay until 2:00AM to get the music notes right or sees anything wrong with throwing a chair at one of his students who can't keep up with his tempo. His personality is vulgar, blatantly calling his students two demeaning twelve-letter words, along with some other homemade curse words himself, giving these kids more discipline than they've ever been granted in their lives. Fletcher doesn't just push kids past their limit; he pushes them into mentally-corrupting realms, boldly stating to Andrew, 'there are no two words in the English language more harmful than 'good job'.' Beneath an incorruptible drive in Andrew is a tender, soft soul at first, who sheds a single tear when Fletcher vulgarly criticizes him for the first time. 'What am I, a double rainbow?,' he asks Andrew, spitting and contorting his face in various ways. Fletcher is a no-nonsense guy, and no better to play him than the incorrigible character actor Simmons himself. The man who played a contemptible, vile subhuman in HBO's 'Oz' gives probably his most engaging performance yet as one of film's strictest, most uncompromising professors. His intensity is heightened to the point where we, the audience, feel compelled to lift our theater seats, despite them being bolted to the ground, and hurl them at his character, calling him every disgusting name he has called his students.I've said before that Teller is on his way to becoming a truly remarkable actor, after performances in 'The Spectacular Now' and 'Two Night Stand' show true promise as a human leading male and 'Whiplash' will be one of the various used to iterate that point to others. Teller communicates not only the attitude but the mentality and the realism of these characters, becoming not just a person for his films, but an attitude and a personality, throwing himself into the mindset of a dateless loser, a teenage alcoholic, or, in this case, an incomparably determined music student. His performance here is by far his most amazing work.'Whiplash' also features a beautiful score and live orchestra music, maybe not in the opinion of Simmons' Fletcher, who would probably ostracize it as a contribution to the downfall of contemporary jazz, but sounds absolutely incredible. The piece of music 'Whiplash,' played frequently in the film, is a mesmerizing and relaxing piece of music, contrasting the film's breakneck tone. On top of that, the editing style of the film, done by Tom Cross, is a visually arresting art here, consistently captivating us with briskly-paced scenes of literal blood and sweat and close-ups of a wide variety of musical instruments as they are both prepared and played.Much will be made about the ending; some will love it, others will say it's incomplete. I find it to be satisfying, if disheartening. While audiences, after giving it enough thought and credit, will likely be pleased, they may realize a deeper sadness and that sadness is simple – where is Andrew going after this? Without divulging into spoiler territory, it's something every artist faces after his or her best work and it's a terrifying thought. For a film with such a quiet, almost devastating, ending, 'Whiplash' sure gave me one of the most satisfying movie experiences of the year.",9,0,4,20 November 2014
Scream 2," Even louder than the first
","I know the rule of movies; sequels can NEVER be better than the originals. But in Scream's case this rule is broken. Scream 2 is not only better than the original film but it's also got a better group to back the original leads Sidney, Dewey, and Gale up. Jerry O'Connell, Jamie Kennedy, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Timothy Olyphant, and Marisol Nichols all take part in this great sequel and whether their roles are short or long, they are appreciated.Scream did however mess with one thing in it's years; the self aware aspect. It works in this film, and it's good because the film, like I said, knows when to be scary and knows when to be witty. The sad thing is Scream did so well that now it makes other horror films like newer installments of Friday the 13th and I Know What You Did Last Summer feel like they need to be self aware to be good. Not the case.Scream has the right writing and direction to accomplish such a goal. The characters know they are in a real life sequel. Wes Craven knew what he wanted to do and screenwriter Kevin Williamson knew how to be good with references without going too overboard. Nowadays this concept is beyond overused and is now becoming a tiresome and dreary old form of comedy/horror. Only Scream could accomplish it correctly.Scream 2 is relatively the same thing as it's predecessor. Only now the lead characters have all seen a film called Stab which is the movie version of the murders they were involved with. Sort of like Scream is a movie about itself. Following? Well, same formula here. The characters know every horror movie cliché and instead of making the usual mistakes, they come up with ways to do their own mistakes.I like the cast a lot more in the sequel. We get Jerry O'Connell, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Rebecca Gayheart, Timothy Olyphant, Omar, Epps, and even Marisol Nichols has a brief cameo. The cast is perfect. A great addition to a worthy sequel. Normally I don't like sequels more than the originals. But Scream 2 manages to accomplish a bit more than the first.The question at this point is how much more steam does the Scream series have? We have a third film that came out in 2000, and a fourth film in the series, released in 2011. Is Scream going to run itself down? Or will prove worthy of so many sequels and show that you can't ever scream too much? Starring: David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jamie Kennedy, Jerry O'Connell, Omar Epps, Jada Pinkett, Liev Schreiber, Rebecca Gayheart, and Marisol Nichols.

"Hail, Caesar!"," Satire that lacks energy, conviction, characters, character development, a focus, and nearly everything that makes good satire
","After the phenomenal and emotional roller-coaster of 'Inside Llewyn Davis,' a film that still hasn't found the audience it so desperately deserves, Joel and Ethan Coen followup arguably their best film with one that might be their most forgettable. 'Hail, Caesar!' is a disappointment of epic proportions; an empty, unfocused satire on Hollywood business that has too many characters fighting for too little screen time, almost no energy despite attempting to work with a high-stakes plot, no strong character relationships despite the fact that everyone is trying to get a word in at all times during the course of the film, and finally, no central conflict that results in the characters ostensibly mustering up any kind of energy. If the characters themselves barely care about the situations they're in, why should we, the audience, who is now out of the high cost of a movie ticket? The film revolves around a Hollywood mogul Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin), who is hired to help fix the troubled production of a Hollywood epic known as 'Hail, Caesar!.' The film stars the famous Baird Whitlock (George Clooney), who winds up being drugged on-set and kidnapped by a radical group of communists that call themselves 'The Future.' Mannix is tasked with giving the group $100,000 in exchange for his star actor.The Coen brothers spend much of the film hopscotching from different characters and different sets in what feels like a setup for a mini-series rather than a one-hundred minute film. Such characters are Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes), a very meticulous director, Thora and Thessaly Tacker (both played by Tilda Swinton), rival, twin-sister gossip columnists, Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich), a low-rent Western actor-turned-movie-star, who is one of Mannix's closest clients, DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson), an actress who becomes pregnant out of wedlock in the middle of her film, and Burt Gurney (Channing Tatum), a Gene Kelly-type actor, also working under the order of Mannix, who winds up at the center of the film's outstanding dance sequence between a group of Coast Guard members about to embark on a nautical mission that will prevent them from seeing a dame for months.'Hail, Caesar!' is a film of moments, meaning that, once the film is over, you'll remember certain scenes you enjoyed, certain actors' cameos (which most of the aforementioned are) you appreciated, and if you're lucky, lines you can quote verbatim. At the end of the day, the sporadic humor that those little moments provide is not enough to recommend a film. The Coen brothers don't seem to know what direction they want to take this film, and with such a concise runtime, they have no time to make good use of the actors they probably paid quite a bit to show up on set for one day. This gives the film the look and feel that most of these A-list stars are simply fighting over screen time, and that isn't funny, especially when you have true talent being only momentarily showcased so the film can dart off to the next decorated setpiece.Then there's the issue of the film just not having much life to it outside of immaculate costume design and some strong cinematography (done by Roger Deakins, one of Hollywood's most masterful cinematographers working today). Because the actors aren't given characters to work with, no real energy or interest builds for them, and neither do character relationships. What we were supposed to gain from the scene involving Jonah Hill (who is on-screen for maybe a minute and a half) and Scarlet Johansson where Johansson's DeAnna asks Hill's Joseph if pressing down on the machine that stamps the papers hurts his forearm? Was this sort of flirtation so necessary that it needed to be included, or were the Coen's too busy giggling under their breath to notice? 'Hail, Caesar!' is overpopulated with scenes that don't work to further what little plot is here, and with such a high-stakes story about a lead actor being kidnapped by a band of communists, Clooney's Braid Whitlock doesn't seem too phased, Brolin's Mannix, who has never been a particularly strong actor to show real emotion or gusto in his personals, doesn't seem too concerned, so what is there left for us to care about? Some comparison has been made between both 'Hail, Caesar!' and Wes Anderson's 'The Grand Budapest Hotel,' and while the two have a similar approach to dry wit and deadpan humor, as well as similar actors like Fiennes and Swinton, Anderson's picture was a perfect example of copious energy and exhilarating, rapid-fire comic exchanges. 'Hail, Caesar!' is the exact opposite; a frequently dull and almost entirely uninteresting film, predicated upon the strength of a few great scenes and some decent, albeit far, far too short, performances in a thoroughly muddled picture.",4,282,478,5 February 2016
Dark Shadows," Don't hate the performers; hate the script
","Tim Burton and Johnny Depp used to be the most reliable of partners, with their work dating back to 1990 with the release of the beloved Edward Scissorhand. In present time, the public has grown weary of the two men, as they both seem to be putting on a crazy costume party with every film they make. Regardless, I'll always view Burton and Depp as a likable pair, and even with the lukewarm Dark Shadows, I hold optimism that in the near future I'll hold one of their upcoming films as a great picture.Dark Shadows, as stated, is not that film. It's a film with an incredible, Gothic look and tone, but a meandering story that tries to dab into way too many genres. Perhaps because I never watched the soap opera, which is now adored by cultists everywhere, I am entitled to have a more favorable opinion than the average fan. However, even a moviegoer ignorant to the original show may have a hard time enjoying this picture to the fullest extent. It's not the easy time I've had sitting still for one-hundred and thirteen minutes.The plot: Johnny Depp is Barnabas Collins, a 200-year-old vampire who has been kept in a coffin for many years by his evil ex-lover Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green). When he is unearthed, he ventures back home to the gigantic Collinsport Mansion, which resides in 1972 Maine. After reconnecting with the family, including the shy matriarch, Elizabeth (Michelle Pfeiffer) and the new, very attractive helper Victoria (Bella Heathcore), he must find a way to stop Bouchard, who has now completely taken over the Maine town.Depp fully exercises his right to be quirky and outright strange and I wouldn't expect anything less. He makes Barnabas into a likable, but rather forgettable soul, and the other members of the Collins family remain pretty faceless for the entire time, appearing as members of the Addams family only far less interesting. As a non-fan of the series like myself, I'm at least wise enough to know that there has to be something more to this series and these characters than what is presented here. If Barnabas remained the entire focus of the show, like here in the film, and the other characters were sidelined to dry supporting roles, how did it go on to merit a level of cult support and fanatical charm amongst the public? The same went for the dreadful film adaptation of The Dukes of Hazzard, which focused almost entirely on stupidity and car chases. Even those unaware of the true ideas behind the episodes know well enough that the show didn't last several seasons and earn love and fame because of simply that; there had to be more that was simply neglected for the film adaptation.The more prominent problem with Dark Shadows, however, is its lack of self-awareness and thematic certainty. One moment, we see Barnabas fiercely biting the neck of a woman, when the next, we see him making some sort of corny joke that throws the surrounding mood out the window. Is this a comedy? A black one? A costume drama, a quirky thriller? A horror film? An argument can be made for all of those, which is great, but Dark Shadows unevenly cycles through all of those genres that it becomes messy and boring.Saying a Tim Burton movie has great cinematography and beautiful visuals is like saying Ken Burns' documentaries are full of interesting points and always provide knowledge to viewers. The compliment is a commonplace, and in many ways, I appreciate the look of this film over that of Burton's Alice in Wonderland. The Gothic-style replicated here, heavily emphasizing the black, purple, and white color scheme, is richly detailed and eye-poppingly crafted, and the dark cinematography is terrifically presented through an eerily ominous lens. Even its score accentuates a more haunting, unnerving atmosphere than I originally thought.Dark Shadows is a fine picture in the respect that it's made by someone who knows how to decorate a set, utilize special effects effectively, and erect quirkiness on demand. It's just a shame that Burton has such a hard time getting a story across that is interesting and focused. Perhaps it's time for him and Depp to take a break from each other, or seek out a project that will allow them to take a more specific direction, while still breeding their indelible eccentricities into the project. It's a shame to see a few missteps leave two once highly-regarded talents doubted and bashed.Starring: Johnny Depp, Eva Green, Michelle Pfieffer, Bella Heathcore, and Jackie Earle Haley.

The Lion King," A real Disney beauty
","The opening scene of The Lion King will show where you stand with this film in terms of what generation you were born in. People born outside of this generation (say, anytime before 1980) will find it pleasing and enjoyable. Those from this current generation (1981 and beyond, myself included) will be simply in awe and, if one were to recall this from their childhood (who from this time period hasn't seen this?) they may even shed a few tears.I did and I'm not afraid to admit it. The Lion King is a dashingly fierce achievement from Disney, one with gripping scenes of delight and uncompromising beauty and charm. Its songs seem more than just standard Disney archetypes, but those of true power and importance, especially 'Hakuna Matata' and 'Circle of Life,' the opening ballad.The story concerns Simba, a feisty cub whose parents, Mufasa and Sarabi, carry a very respected reputation throughout the land. Mufasa is 'the king of the jungle' and Simba 'can't wait to be king,' and for that reason, is always getting into some sort of trouble. Mufasa's brother, Scar, is jealous and holds an incredible disdain for his brother and Simba. When Simba gets himself into big trouble, causing a wild stampede of hyenas (which, by the way, is just breathtakingly slick and stylish), Mufasa is killed by Scar, when trying to rescue Simba. Scar makes Simba feel as if he was responsible for the death of his father and implores him to run away.So he does, and Scar takes the throne in no time, running the Pride Lands into the ground and completely ruining the consistency and order Mufasa took so long to build.Upon running away, Simba meets up with Timon, a meerkat, and Pumba, a warthog in 'the jungle, the mighty jungle.' They teach the naive little cub how to thrive in the jungle, and fast-forward a few years, and Simba is older, stronger, even feistier than before, and with a full grown mane.The Lion King collectively merges the classic Shakespearean story of Hamlet with the divine simplicity and the 'walk on the other side of the road' formula of their 1967 hit Jungle Book into a true achievement in every category. There's a beautiful thing about the way the film conceives emotions and builds on locations. From the first frame to the last, it is littered with evocative landscapes, some of which are hard to believe they're only hand-drawn, pre-CGI work. The use of lighting and darkness can be vaguely called 'animation noir' before it became a real standard, with the sunlit landscapes of the Pride Lands and the excellent use of darkness when it came to showcasing the Scar character, is truly masterful and beyond words.It is also interesting to note that The Lion King sort of kicks off Disney's 'dare to be different' phase that it maintained well into the 2000's with films like Atlantis: The Lost Empire and Lilo and Stitch truly pushing what the company can really do. The Lion King's story, mainly centered around guilt, power, and redemption, is a lot darker with only occasional touches of humor breaking through the melancholic presence of the story. The youngsters may have a hard time coping. I know if I saw this any younger than six it would've been uncomfortable. Though it seems that with the abundance of re-releases the film is getting, the story appeals to those of all ages.NOTE: It's a shame that Disney has stooped to the level of manipulation and tampering with this grandiose animated achievement. To see it get a 3D re-release and multiple re-releases on DVD just to become lucrative for the company, also equipped with a surcharge, is somewhat heartbreaking.Voiced by: Matthew Broderick, Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Moira Kelly, Nathan Lane, Ernie Sabella, and Rowan Atkinson.

Sherlock Holmes," Watch out Watson, that pitfall over there is littered with unfocusedness
","Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes is a well-mannered and fairly acceptable revival to a mystery character as old as time itself. His name has been associated with sarcastic remarks, among other things, and it seems that between two Hollywood movies and the BBC program that the character has waltzed his way back into the mainstream eye. It always seemed to me that the character of Sherlock Holmes was more of a hipster phenomenon rather than a mainstream one. The film manages to keep the look and feel of an 'inside joke,' but unfortunately, can't escape its oppressive Hollywood weight.Let's the start with the premise; It's 1891, and in the beginning, Holmes (Downey Jr.) and Watson (Law) chase down Lord Blackwood (Strong) so as to prevent a harsh ritual, wind up stopping him, and have him arrested, to learn three months later that he is dead. Watson looks forward to escaping the mundane town to marry his love Mary Morstan (Reilly) and leave Holmes to fend for himself. It isn't until Holmes is greeted by Rachel McAdams's Irene Adler, who tells him to search for a missing man named Luke Reordan, who is apparently the main puzzle piece to Blackwood's future plans.The first problem is the central storyline, which isn't very gripping or involving, rather than just acting as a storytelling device. A plot to have one if you will. It's tolerable, but at times, it seems singled out by Hans Zimmer's extravagant music and overshadowed by the chemistry of Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. One could easily become more entranced with character relationships and bantered wit much more than the filler storyline.Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law make an impeccable duo, as brazen and as enjoyable as ever. Quite possibly the best actors to ever portray these characters. Downey is a superb actor for the roll, brash and unapologetic in his words and intellect, while Law portrays Watson as a more subtle figure in Holmes' cross-hairs. The comic possibilities of the screenplay are explored in a divine form, making way for a lot of button-pushing and world play to come into great effect. Their banter is undoubtedly the most fun thing in the film, and both characters have ignitable chemistry and presence on screen.As far as set designs work, Philippe Rousselot's ravishing cinematography, most of the time, works in the film's favor. Once in a while, it seems the backgrounds were more of the central concerns than the writing or tone, but it still comes off as fun and pleasant, without being too hard on the eyes or even heavy-handed and misguided.For me, Sherlock Holmes was a tad thin and vacuous. Ritchie's direction is great, the chemistry between the cast is welcomed and unforced, and the cinematography and music all of likable quality, but the film's storyline is a tad too unfocused and dry, and the redundancy of the look and feel for over two hours becomes a little hard to digest. I'm not entirely sure what fans will think of it. The mystery aspect seems a little flushed out in favor of other things, which I believe was one of the best things in the original series and shorts, and Hollywood has yet again taken a perfectly capable idea and manipulated it to the point where repetition and familiarity comes into play before anything in the film does.Starring: Robert Downey Jr., and Jude Law, Rachel McAdams, Mark Strong, and Kelly Reilly.

The Waterboy," Sandler's worst thus far
","Adam Sandler has succeeded in making his lamest, most desperate feature thus far. The Waterboy is an atrocious picture, comically and socially inept, pathetically humorless, and void of all things likable.Sandler has taken the formulaic structure of his previous feature, Happy Gilmore, made a few adjustments to the character and pacing, and somehow made a less likable film altogether. I've mentioned before that despite all the praise I have heard, I found Happy Gilmore to be a mediocre comedy. The Waterboy manages to take an already unnecessary screenplay and formula of creating an unlikable protagonist that is nothing shy of intolerable and again making him the main character in the film. The first step to making a bad film.The film is played the same way as well. Sandler is Bobby Boucher a stuttering water boy for the Louisiana Cougars. He is constantly pushed around for his strange lisp-like accent and the fact that he never fights back. After being kicked off the Cougars team, he approaches Coach Klein (Winkler) of the South Central Louisiana State University Mud Dogs. Klein discovers that when Bobby becomes angry, he becomes violent and that can help the team. So commences underdog story number two-thousand as Bobby goes from nothing to something.I am beginning to reach a personal quandary. How is possible to assemble a comedy film where not a single character is likable or even remotely tolerable? This shouldn't come as a surprise. Sandler's exercise in poor taste can be considered even poorer than poor taste. Let's look at his past and current filmography. We have the mediocre Happy Gilmore, the crass and pathetic I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry, the melodramatic but strangely acceptable Click, the well-crafted 50 First Dates (despite a few problems I mentioned in my review), the underwhelming Grown Ups, the incredibly unlikable Just Go With It, and the most recent abomination, Jack and Jill. Man, can a filmography get anymore divided? I believe the reason Sandler is such an unbalanced actor is the fact he can't make a comedy without making characters that are shallow, immoral, and intolerable, or make a drama without being ridiculous and unnecessarily comedic. The Waterboy is on a whole different level, though. It doesn't even feel like it is trying to be creative or clever. It's an assembly of repetitive sequences, plagued with an immediately unconvincing character that is sadly our protagonist, a script that feels distended and uninspired, and a formula that may as well have just told us in the beginning how the thing turns out. You know how movies do that? They make the end sequence first, hardly leaving any suspense for the real ending? The Waterboy needed that so many unfortunate audience members would be spared of inane dreck.Starring: Adam Sandler, Kathy Bates, Henry Winkler, Fairuza Balk, and Jerry Reed.

WALL·E," A refreshing, limitless landmark
","WALL-E is perhaps one of the most subversive films by Pixar Animation Studios and one of the most significant animated films in many years. The film is comprised of little dialog, breathtakingly clear, but often dirty visuals that contradict the bubbly, colorful palette of colors we're used to seeing in contemporary animation, and can be seen as a showcase for several motifs and deep themes.We open in the year 2805, where Earth has become a haven for mass amounts of garbage thanks to extreme levels of consumerism perpetuated by a massive corporation called 'Buy N Large.' Earth's population was evacuated in the early 2100's to reside in certain ships in space. Left behind were 'WALL-E' robots, small trash-compactors that would make identical cubic blocks out of the trash left behind by humans before stacking them into gigantic skyscrapers. Eventually, all the bots died off, except for one, who is still mindlessly operating and compacting trash day-after-day.WALL-E lives in a storage truck, kept cozy by pieces from human civilization that bring him comfort. One day, he is brought more comfort by discovering EVE, a much-more advanced robot who is deployed from the Buy N Large spaceship to track down vegetation on Earth. WALL-E meets and is attracted by EVE, and the two form a bond, communicating through ambiguous sounds and the occasional disjointed line of robotic dialog.There is hardly any dialog during the first act of the film; the second act is populated by a bit more than the first and the third is largely devoted to speaking because our focus has shifted from the dilapidated Earth to the more populous Axiom spaceship. Much of the film is largely focused on showcasing the variety of sounds WALL-E and EVE make, leaving the viewer to utilize those little bits of sound as the main point of reference when it comes to trying to define the emotion and the feelings the characters are currently going through. The sound design was largely conducted by Ben Burtt, the so-called 'godfather of sound' for the film industry, and his meticulous craft shows. A viewing of the making of WALL-E reminds - or perhaps informs us - that when animation is made, nothing has a sound. Animated character movements are, by default, silent and every sound, down to the footsteps, must be done in real life before being uploaded to the film itself. The meticulous craft of Burtt and the entire sound team is an act of devotion and perfection that may go noticed by an inattentive viewer.Returning to my point made about WALL-E being the most thematically heavy film Pixar has ever made, such themes are technological advances, mass-consumerism, Christianity, love, corporation-takeover, and conformity. Consider the Buy N Large, the massive store in the sky that caters to an obese population of men and women that ride around in hovering seats, consuming food and drinks out of a cup, and wearing whatever the loudspeaker tells faithful shoppers what to where. The scene exploring the Buy N Large warehouse is a fascinating but poignant look at the effects of mass consumerism in America. It shows the kind of thing we'd like to believe we're immune to as humans but, unfortunately, are not and can be manipulated and directed in ways we never truly thought possible.The film was directed by Andrew Stanton, who largely led the team in creating Finding Nemo, one of Pixar's most renowned pictures for its emotionally touching story and beautiful animation. Finding Nemo featured some of the best animation, I believe, the CGI world has ever seen, and WALL-E's grittier, darker animation is not to be dismissed either. Stanton and the team of animators capture the vast landscapes of Earth and its desolate state, as well as space and its limited state. The animation is put to an incredible effect and Stanton proves to be worthy of operating with the animation company.WALL-E, too, shows a future where conformity is incredible. Everyone wears the same thing, possesses the same features, operates with little individualism, and function in the way where laziness appears to be something of an achievement. This is a frightening feature in a kids film; one that I don't see many young children picking up instantly. This isn't just the part of the film that keeps adults awake but keeps adults questioning the future we may be in for.Furthermore, the film works beautifully as a tone-piece and an amazingly made film in terms of grandiose animation and sound design. Ben Burtt's sound design and meticulous craft in pairing each obscure movement with a practical sound is easily the strongest thing in the film. Despite the lack of dialog, the film never fails to engage a viewer by showing them an unconventional love story that is made unpredictable because the way that Wall-E and EVE communicate is nonlinear and often ambiguous. These ingredients make WALL-E a truly stunning piece of animated art.Directed by: Andrew Stanton.",10,1,2,12 October 2013
The Terminal," Wonderful, whimsical, optimistic, yet sometimes poignant
","As a film, The Terminal is a beauty to watch and to look at. Yes, I believe the two are different. At least in this sense. Just because you're watching a film doesn't mean you like looking at it. You're sort of just watching what is happening. Who knows if you actually like what you're seeing? It's like if you're seeing Saw. Yes, you're watching it, but do you like to look deeply into the eyes of victims who have been gutted and left for dead? The Terminal is a lot brighter and more vivid than most dramas I have seen, and it's a beautiful film all around. It's food for your eyes and your thoughts.I'm not sure another actor could've played the character of Viktor Navorski better. Tom Hanks has been working in film for about thirty years now, and has ejected his charisma into almost every character he has played. As an actor, Hanks is fantastic. As a character actor, Hanks is excellent.In The Terminal, he is Viktor Navorski, who travels from the fictional country of Krakozhia to the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. Navorski's native country is in ruins with a recent revolution taking place, and all planes in and out of the country have just been halted. His passport and credit cards are no longer valid either, meaning he can't enter the United States. He has slipped through a rare, unexpected crack that basically states he can't go forward or backwards. He has can't pass 'Go' or collect $200.His home base is the airport, a large and, literally, foreign world to Viktor, who can't speak English fluently. He spends most of his time desperately seeking money by returning luggage carts for a quarter a piece so he can have his next meal, eating saltine crackers and ketchup, and sleeping restlessly on rows of chairs. I'd like to call The Terminal a comedy, but the film is so sad in some parts it earns the title of 'a drama.' CBP Head Frank Dixon (Tucci) questions Navorski's strange behavior and his unhinged abiding of the rules. He doesn't resist, yell, scream, or get flustered. He just abides. Dixon wants Navorski out of his care, and tries to force him out the doors of the airport. Much to his dismay, Navorski chooses to follow the rules and stay put until the light is green. There is something so very admirable about a character who can cope peacefully in a cryptic and stressful situation.It is much to my surprise that the entire airport is a man-made set in a hangar in Palmdale. It looks marvelous. According to director Steven Spielberg, everything functions as it would in real life, with real food and drinks in the designated outlets, real working stoves in the food court, bathrooms, escalators, etc.I love films set in a public area, which would explain my fondness for films like Career Opportunities, Clerks, and Mallrats. Why I'm so astonished at The Terminal's location is that the film doesn't feel low or shy on material where it has to resort to pictorial aspects as a means of humor and substance. Scenes from a Mall, a Woody Allen movie, was about a married couple working out their marital differences, in public, while walking around a mall. There were so many unnecessary elements like a cloyingly unfunny mime wandering around with them and the fact that Allen's character had to lug around a huge yellow surfboard for the majority of the film. Those elements felt like gratuitous and impetuous distractions. Not to mention, the film didn't need to be set in a mall area. This was a film about a couple working out their differences; why did they have to do it in public? The Terminal avoids redundancy by including various characters, and dodges caricatures and dramatic dead-ends by providing development and substance to each one it introduces. When we go to an airport, we don't care about the janitor, the security guards, the people in there, or the people flying the plane; we care about getting from there to our desired destination, on time, and in one piece. Spielberg has created a wonderful, whimsical, optimistic, yet sometimes poignant story focusing on a man's unfortunate experience in purgatory without turning it into a ridiculous epiphany or a laugh riot.Starring: Tom Hanks, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Stanley Tucci, Barry Shabaka Henley, Kumar Pallana.

The Blind Side," A Drama with a Passion in a Soul Never Seen
","Going into this moderate expectations, I came out astonished. The Blind Side is more than a documentary. But a tear-jerking true story of now Baltimore Raven's player Michael Oher. How a nice family takes in a poor, homeless kid who is nearly starving. And how a homeless boy's life is now an inspiring football player in the NFL.I'm not into football too much. I'm a Bears fan seeing as I settle in Illinois. I occasionally watch their games, though with disappointing years occurring frequently I found myself skipping most of this season.In The Blind Side, Sandra Bullock is a typical mother living in Tennessee with a husband, a teenage daughter named Collins, a younger son named SJ, and soon to be, adopted eighteen-year-old Michael Oher. Oher was taken from his mother at a young age after she was on a drug arrest and his dad was killed and thrown off of a bridge. Michael Oher goes to live with the family, showing beautiful manners (like eating at the table when everyone eats in the living room) and other acts.Oher often flashes back to when he was evicted from his home. When that happens, he closes his eyes because when his mom would do drugs that is what she would tell him to do. Bullock tries to help him get his life back on track, when she learns that Michael has a talent in protection. Seeing that, Bullock persuades him to go out for football as a defense player.Lots of sad moments and reflections take place in this movie. The dark satire for the film works well and flows along with the movie. Sandra Bullock deserves an Academy Award for Best Dama (which I believe she is nominated for anyway). I didn't know what to expect with this. Bullock has done good things and bad things. But this will go down has one of her best.Starring: Sandra Bullock, Tim McGraw, Quinton Aaron, and Kathy Bates.

The Shawshank Redemption," The placement isn't an exaggeration
","As of March 2012, Frank Darabont's The Shawshank Redemption is sitting pretty on the 'IMDB Top 250' list with 731,886 ratings averaging at about 9.2/10. That's astounding. On Rotten Tomatoes, a site much more critical where it is a rarity that new movies possess a 'fresh' rating, the film has merited a 90%. Another commendable achievement. I bring these two facts up because I'm just amazed at how high the film is ranked. Here's a film that holds the 'IMDB Top 250' list by a long shot, yet doesn't immediately come to people's mind when thinking 'the best movie of all time.' Of course, being on the 'IMDB Top 250' doesn't qualify as an official listing. Being featured on AFI's list is more respectable, but still, it is subjective. Just a bit more broader and stronger, since a group of high intellectuals choose the films. If one looks further down the 'Top 250' list, you'll see a number of questionable entries such as The Dark Knight, Inception, and Toy Story 3. Their presence doesn't necessarily mean they're the best - just the highest rated by people.But I have no quibbles about Shawshank's placing on the list; it is a wonderful, wholesome parable about redemption and reassurance of one's self worth while locked inside a penitentiary. We are met with characters who are trying to escape the confines of a monotonous lifestyle in prison, bot mentally and physically, and find a rare amount of comfort when with each other. The film is adapted from Stephen King's short story, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption - a novella that isn't so much physical suspense and horror as it is psychological horror; a different route for King, an author who has focused so much on the supernatural and the victimized outcasts in his long career.We are placed in Shawshank State Penitentiary, located in Maine in 1947, where Andy Dufresne (Robbins) is convicted of murdering his cheating wife and her lover and is given two life sentences. Andy assures he is innocent, but circumstances prove differently. He meets Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding (Freeman), a man too serving life, who acts as a con man who can get you anything you want as long as you give him his asking price plus 20%. At first, Red doesn't think too much of Andy, betting ten cigarettes with his buddies that he'll cry the first night in prison.Andy doesn't cry. He seems rather content, despite the treatment and hell he has been through. As time passes, by time I mean years and eventually decades, Andy's relationship with Red grows. They become understanding of each others positions, and Red takes a rare liking to the man. So do many other prisoners. At first, Andy is a victim of mistreatment and abuse from his villainous and heartless prisoners, but he eventually keeps his head held high, and works out deals with Warden Samuel Norton, who is played by Bob Gutton in a scarcely recognized performance that is equal parts frightening and breathtaking, to do odd-jobs around the prison to earn money, but more importantly, respect.Not only do the prisoners become smitten with him, but the guards, policemen, and suits alike. They admire his persistency. There comes a time where Andy desperately wants more funding for Shawshank, not just for bars, guards, and walls, but for books and to assimilate growth for the feeble and decrepit library currently in the prison. The guard tells him that he can write as many letters as he wants but the state government won't pay any mind. So, Andy patiently writes one letter every week to try and convince them why extra funding is vital.Here's where the spoiler comes in. The film's main morals are optimism, self worth, and hope. The film's tagline perfectly spells out its identity; 'Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free.' There is a character in the film named Brooks (Whitmore), who is the prison trustee. Upon being released from the penitentiary, Brooks commits suicide by hanging himself. The reason was because he never had any sort of dreams or plans. Never any vision of hope or compassion for anyone. He was just a human being living in fear. Andy succeeds because he has learned to carry optimism on his shoulders. He eventually teaches Red the same lesson.The spoiler's over. Moving on, the film illustrates the passing time, which I mentioned was decades, beautifully and naturally. The film will seem long to some, but it shows how slowly the prison life plods along. How mundane and redundant it must get to get up, confined to small rooms, and work for very low wages every day. And you thought your corporation job was miserably insufferable.But where Shawshank really excels is in its humanism. It evokes prisoners as people, with morals and livelihood. Not as monsters. It is true, many, many people in prison deserve to be there, but we never look past the caricature of a psychopath or a deviant when we think about what kinds of people are really in there. They're not all bad people. People who question me on that should contemplate long and hard on this question; is Red a bad person? Or even a monster? The Shawshank Redemption is a marvelous journey through parts rarely explored. It is immersing in not only its characters and story, but in its touching, light cinematography which projects a wide range of dispositions throughout the entire excursion. Rarely does a film rub us this way, and rarely does one seem to rub everyone the same way. All the more reason, its placement on the 'Top 250' really isn't an exaggeration.Starring: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, and Bob Gutton. Directed by: Frank Darabont.",10,2,3,25 March 2012
Rango," This cowboy got some tricks unda' his hat
","Rango is charming, inspiring, beautifully crafted and, for once, it doesn't get cocky by boasting 3D. The film proves my point that a film, not in 3D, can still leap off the screen with its antics and fun. If Rango was in 3D as is, I don't think the 2D viewing would be any less enjoyable, but it would give audience members the impression it was another lame children's movie that's only gimmick is 3D.Director Gore Verbinski states 'Absolutely. But I mean, I'm responsible for my own kids and not responsible for anyone else's. So I think that's what PG means, 'parental guidance' when asked if he thinks children are underestimated when it comes to movies. I completely agree. If I had, maybe, a six to nine year old I would definitely take them to see Rango despite its darker approach than more kid movies.The plot: A pet chameleon (Voiced by Johnny Depp) becomes stranded in the Mojave Desert when his home falls off the back of his owner's car. The chameleon takes the name 'Rango' from a sign he sees, and meets an iguana named Beans (Fisher) who takes him into a town called 'Dirt.' The town is occupied by desert animals, and Rango learns there is a huge drought occurring in the town. With the minor help of the shady mayor (Beatty) and some other town-folk, the group sets out to solve the problem of the drought, and bring water back to their desperate area.No matter what Verbinski directs, he always darkens the atmosphere and I applaud him for that. The Pirates of the Caribbean series, a series I've never caught on to, I can tell from the first film it was a darker and more serious pirate adventure than the formulaic. Even his forgotten 1997 comedy Mouse Hunt, I've been told, has some darker elements.The voice acting, even though done by big name actors, still has a certain innocence to it. A good innocence. The kind of harmless tone to it. I fell in love with the Rango character, and how he was simple, yet complex in his journey. He reminded me of the unlikely hero which I'm sure he was representing. He was jittery, yet took acts of bravery. I admire that in a person.I think the key to really enjoying this film is the more you watch Western films. I, myself, don't watch a whole lot of Western films, but the more John Wayne you watch, the more caught up in the storyline you're likely to be. Its goal is to be very satirical, and boy is it successful. Fans of any Western film, and maybe even some Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas fanboys, will likely be dazzled by the humor in Rango.If someone had told me a film, like Rango, with fire breathing scenes, chase scenes, a sizzling snake that spins around frequently, and a good number of things that fly around was coming to theaters in regular 2D, I probably would've laughed. But seeing the execution should prove to people that you don't need to add another dimension to the movie to make it come off the screen. If you have enough action scenes that aren't over the top, that have a purpose and have a bit of a cheery nature to them especially in a cartoon, 3D scenes in a 2D movie will come natural.Voiced by: Johnny Depp, Abigail Breslin, Isla Fisher, Ned Beatty, Alfred Molina, Bill Nighly and Timothy Olyphant.

The Big Short," A delightful merging of information and comedy
","No subject in the world is inherently interesting or uninteresting, for it's always about the communicative method or channel used to promote or inform one about the subject that is either interesting or not. Having said that, some subjects are more alienating than others, and one of those subjects is economics/finance, largely because of its dependency upon a plethora of terminology and jargon that usually cannot be adequately defined without including other terminology or jargon. Before you know it, searching the definition of something like a 'Roth IRA' leads you to Google searches about embezzlement and quantitative easing in efforts to try and circumvent and define what you were originally looking for.Thankfully, Adam McKay's The Big Short assumes the audience is fairly stupid and blissfully ignorant when it comes to the interworkings of what led to the global economic crisis of 2007-2008, which saw record unemployment and catastrophic results for the usually reliable housing market. In true movie fashion, we observe the financial crash, not from an insider standpoint, where sure-fire, grade-A trades and exchanges are being made, but by a plethora of quirky outsiders trying to run away from a boulder that keeps gaining on them until it flattens them and everyone in their tracks. The only ones saved are the ones who didn't manage to fall or stumble when pushing said boulder down the hill in the first place.We initially meet a quirky hedge fund manager named Michael Burry (Christian Bale), who discovers that the U.S. housing market is based on a series of subprime loans (which, we are told by Margot Robbie as she soaks in a bubblebath whilst sipping champagne, may as well be synonymous with 's***') and is inevitably going to collapse sometime in the second quarter of 2007. Being that the housing market is often viewed as the safest bet in America, Michael begins to go around to different banks to bet against the stability and long-term security of the housing market in efforts to profit from the impending disaster.Then there's Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling), a fairly small-time investor, who winds up putting in his own money to bet against the housing market, along with Mark Baum (Steve Carell), a cynical and depressed banker of many years. The two wind up discovering that the market collapse is further aided by the solicitation of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), basically collections of the aforementioned subprime loans that come packaged together and market as competent and reliable investments.Finally, there's Charlie Geller (John Magaro) and Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock), two young-bloods anxious to break into the financial market. The inexperienced duo enlist in the help of a retired, conservative banker named Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt), who helps them make decisions with their money. Unlike the other more experienced men, both Charlie and Jamie lack the kind of gusto and namesake that allows them into the offices of big name bankers. As a result, they pine for a bigger piece of the pie in a smaller way, largely by lounging in their parents' basements, hunched over their iPads.The Big Short functions as a competent, satirical anthology that breaks down the financial crisis - that is now nearly a decade old, if you can believe that - enough to be informative and entertaining. Considering this is from Adam McKay, a frequent collaborator with Will Ferrell and Funny or Die, responsible for films like Casa De Mi Padre, The Other Guys, and Step Brothers, this is a huge step in the right direction for him as a name in comedy and satire. Rather than focusing on a bargain-barrel Spanish telenovela satire or a tired, mean-spirited comedy based around who can yell the loudest, McKay sets his sights on peddling information through the most communicable form - entertainment. If you can succeed in meriting consistent laughs while teaching an audience something, you have profoundly succeeded at two things many have a difficult time accomplishing in a separate sense. That alone is worth considerable praise.While the screenplay by McKay and Charles Randolph is undoubtedly a big part at why this film succeeds, The Big Short is a true testament to brilliant comedic acting on various cylinders, as well. The men of the hour, specifically, are both Bale and Carell, seriously taking on opposite personas that they pull off to a tee. Bale plays confused and downright quirky with just the right amount of edge to make him believable rather than hopelessly incompetent or downright silly, and Carell's sporadic bouts of rage and lack of self-awareness make him all the more watchable screen presence. Other performances, like Gosling's, who serves as the infrequent, anti-hero narrator, is notable for its brash charm, in addition to Pitt, who works largely because he's even more understated and harder to define than in his latest film By the Sea.The Big Short has a lot of comedic value, but it's nonetheless a frightening depiction of where America is currently at; a depressing oligarchy, controlled and manipulated by those with money at the mercy of those without. We've seen 'The Great Recession of 2007,' as it's sometimes called, plunge numerous working class and poor families into further states of hopelessness, while those who helped cause and further the effects of the recession have gone on to have a road of many ups and few downs since then. McKay's eye, ear, and talent for conducting satire in a way that's simultaneously uproariously funny, in addition to having the ability to be truly upsetting, is quite marvelous and unexpected, and one can only hope that with proper recognition and compensation for his efforts on this film, he furthers down this path rather than the one he was previously on.",8,120,158,29 December 2015
The Conjuring," A wonderful film that reminds us of the building blocks of horror filmmaking
","In a way, director James Wan has evolved as a horror filmmaker for the better. His first effort in the field was the torture porn flick Saw, a mostly solid, amiable effort. His followups were the equally tense films Dead Silence and Insidious (whose sequel-trailer precedes The Conjuring), and now, has evolved as a filmmaker who articulates tension and buildup beautifully with The Conjuring, a taut display of creepy horror cinema.The plot: Carolyn and Roger Perron (Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston) and their five daughters move into an old decrepit farmhouse in the middle of nowhere and begin to experience the a string of paranormal activity in the house. The clocks all specifically freeze at 3:07am, a music box one of the daughters plays with has her claiming she can see a boy named 'Rori' when it finishes playing music, and odd smells and physical abuse come about from what appears to be paranormal entities, as well.Helpless and after the haunting seems to cause mental harm to the children, Carolyn and Roger seek out the help of Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Famiga), two paranormal investigators that try to piece together what, if anything, is haunting the Perron farmhouse and how the 'inhuman spirits' came about.The Conjuring's plot is obviously sickeningly familiar and horribly unoriginal. However, despite the overused and questionable 'based on a true story' that the film states early-on, it works largely in part because it tries to make the events here believable and not real. The film itself is meant to serve as something of a retelling of true events - not the actual thing. When watching a sequel to Paranormal Activity, which is passed off as real and not a work of fiction, you find yourself asking, 'how is this real?' When watching this film, which is passed off as realistic, you find yourself asking, 'how is this not real?' This is largely thanks to James Wan's studious camera framing and John R. Leonetti's wonderfully creepy, seventies-style cinematography. It's difficult to make a modern home scary, but one from the seventies, featuring eerie knick-knacks, odd wallpaper, strange little porcelain dolls, and a load of dark places is inherently creepy in its oldness. The film features the wonderful 'slowburn' technique, which will likely take criticism because The Conjuring's agenda doesn't call for anything to be rushed. At one-hundred and twelve minutes, it has just enough time in the beginning to show you the atmosphere of the rural area where the farmhouse resides and takes the time to build tension effectively.Usually the last thing I find myself discussing when reviewing horror films is the acting, but the naturalistic acting of everyone here must be formally mentioned. Patrick Wilson and Vera Famiga (who always seems to take front-and-center in several contemporary horror films) works wonders as two demonologists, who will inevitably become victim to the Perron haunting as well as trying to be the ones remedying the effects. Ron Livingston has been spectacular in the several film roles he has taken in the last few years, and this one here is no exception, and Lili Taylor takes the cake here as the strongest performance, as he simply tries to be the caring and compassionate mother when the uncertain is taking effect.The Conjuring takes the personality a lot of Hammer Horror Films do, which are, what have now been called, 'classic horror films' that emphasized tension and atmosphere over blood and quickly-paced action. The closest thing I've seen to The Conjuring in the last year or so was probably the forgotten but memorable Woman in Black, which was largely a movie about Daniel Radcliffe roaming a house full of eerie decorations and cobwebs. It was a creepy, tonally effective picture and that's just what The Conjuring is.Not everything works here as well as you'd expect. The development gets a little predictable and the ending seems to cave too much into mainstream expectations. However, this is still a wonderful change-of-pace for contemporary horror, especially being a summer release, when, if anything, the most serious horror films come out in the early months of the year. If anything, The Conjuring reminds us what the fundamental principles of horror filmmaking are, it's that the environment is everything and that forgoing that thought for lame, contrived scenes of slaughter, exorcism, or mindless drivel is an act of genre-blasphemy.Starring: Patrick Wilson, Vera Famiga, Lili Taylor, and Ron Livingston.

Scream," Still holds up on it's wit and scares
","I would like to point out that the version of Scream I watched was the 'Director's Cut' of the film. To my knowledge, it hasn't been released on DVD to this date. I bought it at Comic Con about a year ago for $5 since I bought a complete series of a show that was around $30. I got $10 off. Some would like to know what the differences are from the theatrical cut to the director's cut. Thanks to the DVD cover that says what the film has different from the original I can say.Here is what it says word for word; 'The Director's Cut version includes additional GORE!! Close up of Steve's intestines as they fall from his stomach. Casey as she hangs from the tree at normal speed. Longer scene of Tatum's head being crushed by the garage door. Kenny looking up at the killer after his throat is cut. Billy going berserk as he stabs Stuart. Stuart's hand dripping blood into a puddle (after the double stab).' I wouldn't go nuts looking for the a bootleg copy on Ebay or iOffer. The director's cut maintains the same one hundred and eleven minute runtime and the shots are quick seconds shots that are hardly noticeable. Though I will say the close up of the intestines was one of the many great things on the disc.But what can you say about Scream? It's one of the defining horror films of the nineties. It pokes fun at the clichés in horror films and even goes as far as almost mocking them. Director Wes Craven knew what he was doing precisely when making Scream. He wanted the characters to be extremely self aware they were in a horror film and make them reference other eighties classics.In the eighties, slasher films got their break. So many horror movies made by so many defunct companies were released at hyper speed. Literally one every weekend. Some like Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street went on to be the poster children of the genre. While others like Don't Answer the Phone, Happy Birthday to Me, and Maniac chilled on the sidelines to get recognized years later by cult fans of the genre.I'm not going to take time explaining the plot because I feel it's unnecessary. Many have seen it and a synopsis isn't really vital. I have a lot to say about this and don't need to extend a review with a plot most people would know. Is that okay? Scream now or forever hold your pieces.Scream knows when to be scary and went to be witty. Frequent references to Friday the 13th, Halloween, and A Nightmare on Elm Street (another Craven film) are made sporadically. The references never feel forced and are easy to catch.Once more the film followed with sequels which makes some sort of sense. The film runs for only an hour and fifty one minutes. There is so much more that could be incorporated. Wes Craven went on direct all three (and the upcoming forth film) so decreasing in quality doesn't sound like something that will happen. I hope not at least.Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courtney Cox, and Matthew Lillard are all great and it's no doubt why this film sort of formed all of their great careers. It's a thrill that Campbell, Arquette, and Cox will be returning in Scream 4 making me sort of an easy sale.I look forward to watching the sequels at the same time I'm not. I sort of know I'll like them, but they will most likely lack in quality when compared to the first film. It hit hard when it first came out. Lets hope the sequels continue to refresh and keep the formula alive.Starring: Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courteney Cox, Matthew Lillard, Rose McGowan, Skeet Ulrich, Roger L. Jackson, and Drew Barrymore. Directed by: Wes Craven.",8,0,0,8 April 2011
Prometheus," Scott's formula proves to be among us along with some possibly-foreseen life forms
","It is a vast understatement to label Prometheus one of the most anticipated films of the year. This film was said to have so much and occupied a great deal hype that it was truly impossible that a film could live up to it all. It was rumored to be a prequel to Alien, and I guess now we're just labeling it 'strikingly similar.' Not seeing Alien in probably six or seven years, I can't totally state if the mythology is reminiscent to that film, but I could judge on what very few people are judging it as; its own film.The film's plot wasn't clearly revealed in any trailers and online speculations and leaks were very slim, so it's hard to decipher where the fine line of general information and spoilers are when describing the film. The jist is that it is the year 2089, and a gang of archaeologists discover a rare star map that is apparently linked to the forerunners of the human race. The main scientist funds the creation of the scientific vessel, dubbed 'Prometheus,' so that a group of archaeologists can travel to the moon LV-223. Guided by an android named David (Fassbender), the gang sets off on what becomes a four year journey through the galaxy until they finally land on the distant moon.From there on out, it's exploration time, hopefully answering some much needed questions about the world we inhabit today, the life on this moon, and what lies ahead. The scientists we come to vaguely know are Elizabeth Shaw (Rapace), the man who funded the trip, Peter Weyland (Pearce), Captain Janek (Elba), Shaw's crush, Charlie (Marshall-Green), the monitor of the trip, Meredith (Theron), Milburn the botanist (Spall), and the geologist, Fifield (Harris).All the actors do a very good job at performing throughout the picture, particularly Michael Fassbender as the android. At this point, the man can do no wrong. He has proved himself to be a man of true versatility and charisma, transcending characters from a depraved sex addict to someone non-human. It is rare that in this day and age we get an actor so committed to cinema that he is willing to take roles seemingly for more than the pay. Other crew members, like Idris Elba and Charlize Theron, too do a great job in their respected roles.Not to mention, on an atmospheric note, the film looks remarkable. The visuals are remarkable, some sequences on the moon are very staged brilliantly, and a lot of the environment is put to great use.After we are greeted with these favorable elements, Prometheus starts to become a relatively conventional sci-fi story. Its look is great, but nothing wholly different from what we have seen in recent years, its story is not a deeply moving or one we haven't touched on, and the characters lack depth and sympathy from an audience perspective and that is a big problem. At times, the film seems to be overly concerned with asking questions it doesn't know the answers too (which quickly becomes a burden on the audience's part), and all building up towards the inevitable, forthcoming sequel that will be among us faster than this one can gross a record number.In the original Alien, not only was it fun to watch, but it was delightfully unexpected for its time. It was a surprise to see such technology put to great use, such developed characters functioning inside a different and organized plot, and everything felt fresh and inviting. Prometheus feels like a tune already sung before, just given to a different band.Ridley Scott is the kind of director who you could see getting a barrage of different ideas and making them into capable and memorable epics. The problem is he has a growing talent for choosing scripts that spend too much time on the landscapes and the intricate features rather than character development, tone, and progression. I could compare Prometheus a lot with Gladiator, in the respect that both films are long, sometimes difficult to sit through, not always interesting, plagued by repetition, and are lifted by one performance in the supporting role. They aren't particularly awful films, but painfully ordinary and traditional.It has been mentioned numerous times that the film occupies plot holes. Without thinking too hard about the story, I can think of one. We are greeted with some A-class technology here, some of the brightest, crispest, most involving use of computers I have yet to see in a film. Everything seems so lifelike, accurate, and impenetrable, that if this is rumored to take place a century before Alien or be a standard prequel, I have one question; how is the technology more accurate and everything so meticulously advanced? Starring: Noomi Rapace, Charlize Theron, Michael Fassbender, Guy Pearce, Idris Elba, Logan Marshall-Green, and Sean Harris. Directed by: Ridley Scott.",6,2,6,9 June 2012
Halloween," Imitated but never duplicated
","The best way to describe Halloween is the phrase 'Evil Personified.' It's one of the first of its kind in terms of the slasher genre, and shows exactly what a movie of that genre should be like. Rather than having a melancholy feeling when all this violence is going on, we are fully immersed in the world of these characters and have fear for them. And this is because of one crucial element that is neglected in many horror films old and new.Halloween has artistry, and is so much smarter than any other horror film of its kind. It knows how to hook you and pull you in. The cinematography, dare I say it, is some of the best ever used in film. Dean Cundey handles the setting and material extremely well as he loans his talents to give this film the eeriest appearance possible.Cundey was also the cinematographer for two of the Halloween sequels, Escape from New York, all three Back to the Future films, and Carpenter's other film The Thing. He has the uncanny ability of putting the setting into the foreground. Some of my favorite scenes in Halloween are shots of the streets, the darkness of rooms, the first person shots through the window, etc. They are some of the most elegant shots ever seen in a horror film. I think the last time I saw such great camera/setting work was in Argento's Suspiria.Jamie Lee Curtis gives an effective performance, and the film does an amazing job of not stepping on its feet and not depicting her as a helpless female in distress. Curtis brings life and independence in her character rather than the female who just stands there, looks pretty, swears, and screams. If more horror films used characters like the one Jamie Lee Curtis portrayed we'd probably have a smaller body count in some horror films.The music compliments the film and the cinematography as well. The iconic piano tune from all the Halloween films has been firmly etched in our memory since our first viewing. What makes this song so fantastic is the fact that Carpenter himself wrote the music, and perfectly adds layers of different beats and tones to the song without getting thrown off. Listen to the song, and listen for every time a new synth or a new pitch is added. You'll see the song is handled professionally and exquisitely.The killer, Michael Myers, would later become one of the most iconic killers in film history next to Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees, respectively. Some of the most effective uses of him is when one character peers out the window into the night to see Myers standing completely still or carrying a body around. Those scenes still to this day are gifted by their atmosphere and their cinematography.Halloween is one of the best horror films of all time. The only reason it gets called 'not scary' by people today is because not necessarily scarier things have come out, but films like Hostel and Saw have proved to be bloodier and more limitless. Those aren't bad films, but they're two totally different genre pieces. Halloween is so much smarter than any of the torture porn films because it knows how to scare the audience without splattering them with blood. It's a masterpiece in every sense of the word.Starring: Jamie Lee Curtis, Donald Pleasence, Will Sandin, P.J. Soles, and Nancy Loomis. Directed by: John Carpenter.",10,1,5,3 November 2011
Despicable Me," Despicable When Compared to Toy Story 3
","A.O. Scott, journalist of The New York Times, said 'while there's nothing to hate, there's not much to remember' about Despicable Me and he's 100% correct. While Best Buy does have a special app for Smartphones and iPhones for this (will state what it does and is at the end) called 'Best Buy Movie Mode' which is something I can pretty soon seeing all movies have at one point, this film is still just a poor copy of How the Grinch Stole Christmas. Surely Universal Pictures did a great job animating it and it really looks like the equivalent to a much more recent (and better) film, Toy Story 3. But still, it has the ability for animation, but it doesn't have the fun and morals that are packed in a Pixar film.To sum it up, after a pyramid is stolen in Egypt, we are introduced to Gru (Steve Carell) who is the second best super-villain in the world, right behind Vector (Jason Segel), who stole the pyramid. To fight back, Gru then develops a plan to shrink the moon which he believes will make him the best super-villain. After Vector steals his shrink ray which was to make Gru able to shrink the moon to pocket size, he adopts three girls; Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith, and Agnes to sell cookies to Vector for Gru to be able to take his shrink ray back and continue with his plans. Gru is also armed with thousands of yellow one and two eyed minions. They are the cutest and best thing by far about the movie. Though their English is below average and some words you can understand, but most you cannot, which is where the app comes in.The cute Minions make up the entire film.Best Buy Movie Mode was created so when you 'enter Movie Mode' on your phone when directed by the screen itself, your phone will sync the movie and when the credits come your phone will vibrate (no confusion since the app disables your ringer) and it will subtitle what the little yellow fellows are saying. Its kind of cool, and since I was the only one in the entire theater laughing at the screen when everyone just watched trying to understand them, I felt like I knew more than they did (when I did).Still, it would make more sense if the app buzzed and dubbed what the Minions were saying throughout the movie rather than just at the end. But it was just as equally impressive. I was worried about starting it to early because I thought if I started it during the previews, the phone (which is a Motorola Droid) would think its the beginning and start dubbing when the credits weren't there yet. But the phone syncs it with the film which is almost amazing. Ahh, technology.But the movie itself, wasn't great. Below good, mediocre is the word. The film is a first degree knockoff of The Grinch and next to nothing is memorable. Ill remember the app (which isn't in the movie, so it doesn't count) and Ill remember the Minions. But the Minions are like the penguins in Madagascar. Their the best part, they deserve their own film, instead you are boring us with a back story and basically shielding the good parts away. At least Madagascar still holds up with jokes and doesn't let the secondary characters put on a one (or one thousand) man show.Many kids will love this, but when compared to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Fantasia 2000, Pinocchio, and most recently Toy Story 3. The film just doesn't do it. Take Toy Story 3. The art in that is not only the animation, but the fun the film has. It takes your imagination on a whole new route reintroducing characters that have grown like us. A.O. Scott says its like 'art and junk'. Which it rightfully is. Besides the great voice work (mainly from Carell and Cosgrove) and good animation, the film is just despicably fair.With Voice Talents of: Steve Carell, Jason Segel, Russell Brand, Julie Andrews, Will Arnett, Kristen Wiig, Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier, and Elsie Fisher.

Raging Bull," He isn't nervous that you did it, he's nervous why you won't admit it
","After watching Rocky a few months ago, I doubted that I'd ever see a boxing film that would live up to or surpass its status. It was a trend-starter of a film, that didn't follow a blueprint, but accidentally formed one, that would become carbon-copied and mimicked like Jaws did for shark films. Then along came Raging Bull, a film by the almighty Scorsese. This marks the fifth film of his that I have awarded a perfect score, and the fifth film I've reviewed of his as well.Why do I idolize Scorsese? I find him to be a rare treasure in film. His ability to tackle any story, from a paranoid boxer, to the underground mobsters, to gambling tycoons, to the inter-workings of an Irish gang, to an amazing aviator-turned germaphobe, Scorsese can do it. And make it a work of incorruptible, undeniable art. He is often taken for granted, and not appreciated like he should be. Whether people like to admit it or not, he revolutionized cinema, and will continue to do it for many, many more years.Raging Bull was De Niro's plea to Scorsese to stop using cocaine, and to direct the film he wanted to for years. Scorsese has gone on record saying that De Niro practically saved his life, persuading, if not forcing, him to make the film. Scorsese has stated that Raging Bull was 'kamikaze style filmmaking,' because originally, he never thought he'd make another film. That all changed when the film was met with acclaim from audiences and critics around the country, and three amazing talents, De Niro, Pesci, and Scorsese, were born.The film follows middleweight boxer Jake LaMotta (De Niro), a violent, insecure man who has become obsessed with not only the sport and art of boxing, but controlling everything in his life. He marries a young women named Vicky (Moriarty), and is coached and assisted greatly by his brother Joe (Pesci). Upon marrying Vicky is when Jake's real insecurity and paranoia unfolds. He is constantly fearing that Vicky is seeing other men behind his back. One day, she comments that the boxer Jake's about to fight is a young, limber, good-looking guy who might get the best of him. Before Jake can even consider the other two facts, he stops and lectures her and asks why she calls him 'good-looking.' When it comes to fighting the guy, Jake assures he'll never be called good-looking by anyone for a long time.Main writer Paul Schrader, who also worked on other Scorsese films such as The Last Temptation of Christ and Taxi Driver, does a brilliant job of giving these characters, not only descriptions and stories, but long, healthy monologues that never become routine or laborious. My personal favorite scene is when both Jake and Joe are discussing personal matters while one is trying to fix the Television. The scene goes on for over four minutes, but the dialog is crisp and nothing shy of gripping. This scene is crucial to the plot because it shows Jake's insecurity consuming him and virtually eating him alive. Who can you trust when everyone looks like an enemy? The film is heavily stylistic as well, probably Scorsese's most to date. If anything should be praised, it's the experimental shots Scorsese uses. There are tracking shots that show depth and space, sometimes distorting it, like during the fight scenes, a delightful and rare coherency to the relentless and bloody combat sequences, that are gritty and brutally realistic, and the high contrast black and white further evokes depression and melancholy emotions to the film.This is a beautifully made film in every sense of the word. It's a deep, involving character study on a character we can't stand to look at sometimes. The third act focuses on where LaMotta's nervousness and insecurity got him in life; an ungrateful, cocky, intolerable, narcissistic brute that feels entitled to anything and everything. Yet again, this is a story from Scorsese about short lived glory. Where a man's inner demons and personal conflicts further bog him down to where he becomes unable to function normally. We've seen it before, but every time we do, it seems as if it is told in a richer, more complex way.With all this talk of style, emotion, characteristics, and backstory, let's not forget about another very important element; the rich performances. De Niro is superb, showing passion, charisma, and dedication - all the traits which have lead him to be called 'one of the greatest actors of all time.' Pesci shows great control whenever he's on screen, also brewing his trademark animalistic behavior that has made him instantly recognizable and the subject of many peoples' praise. But let's not forget some side characters that have, over the years, gotten the cold shoulder. Frank Vincent, one of Scorsese's regulars, plays Sal, one of Joe's local connections with the mob in New York. Vincent has been in both Casino and Goodfellas as a supporting character and has never drummed up acclaim of his own. Here, he is spot on perfection, and somewhat underdeveloped and underutilized.Another performance that hasn't garnered enough fame is Cathy Moriarty as De Niro's wife. She is in a harsh position, like most women in Scorsese's films. She is strong, capable, and commendable in her efforts to break free of never-ending torment and fear caused by her husband.Raging Bull is absolutely extraordinary filmmaking, from a director that was hesitant about creating the film in the first place. I'm sure he never thought the film would amount to much, but it has already earned a spot on the National Film Registry, two Oscars, and a place on AFI's list of best films. I'd say it was a worthy gamble, and a lifesaver on Scorsese's part.Starring: Robert De Niro, Cathy Moriarty, Joe Pesci, and Frank Vincent. Directed by: Martin Scorsese.",10,3,5,31 March 2012
Taken 2," 'Taken...again?'
","Back in January, Liam Neeson was on his A-game with The Grey, an abstract, stylish, and truly exhilarating picture about survival of the fittest and how to cope with life when you're down to your wit's end. The film has gone on to have sort of a tainted legacy, with some viewers questioning its logic, its realism or lack thereof, or simply the ending, which has left a good or bad impression on many.It wouldn't surprise me if I learned the same people criticizing the logic and realism of The Grey are the same people who loved Neeson's earlier picture Taken and will be lining up at the multiplex to see this sequel, ominously and ridiculously titled Taken 2 (there's not much else they could've called it, but there are certain titles you don't place a '2' after). Both films lack logical points here and there, but the last time I saw a sequel this lax and lazy was The Hangover Part II. Taken 2 is a thrilling roller-coaster you've rode on before; an exercise in rehashing formula that wasn't particularly compelling the first time around. My praise for the first one was minimal, but I admitted that the film offered more exposition and detail than previous action films cared to give their audience.Yet it would seem the only way Taken 2 knows how to expand on its characters is by flashing back to its predecessor in cheap and choppy fashions. The film opens with a group of men in Albania attending a funeral, mourning the men who ex-CIA operative Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson), killed in efforts to find his kidnapped daughter. Then we cut to present day and learn that Kim is trying to get her driver's license (need I mentioned Kim is played by Maggie Grace, who is twenty-nine and looks absolutely nothing like a teenager?). Bryan is still overprotective, as usual, and decides to book a trip to Istanbul, not far off from Albania, I may add, with his daughter and ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen).But wouldn't you know it? Not too long after Bryan, Lenore, and Kim arrive in Istanbul, the two parents go out for a drive and are subsequently kidnapped by the same Albanian men we saw mourning their loved ones in the beginning of the film. And wouldn't you know something else? When Bryan is tied up, he manages to call Kim, who is still back at the hotel room, and has her open his enormous briefcase of everything a spy/ex-CIA agent could want, pull out a map, calculate the circumference in several areas, ink spots where he might be located, throw multiple grenades out the hotel window to try and see if her father can hear them, and is able to find out exactly where he is in a matter of twenty cinematic minutes? If you thought the original film was incredulous, this film is light years more far-fetched than its predecessor.Olivier Megaton's direction is some of the worst I've seen. Almost as bad as Transformers: Dark of the Moon. The fight scenes (and there are a lot of them) are largely jumbled and incoherent, and the scenes of car chases, with vehicles reaching high speeds and bullets flying in every conceivable direction, shots rarely last longer than a second and the camera never remains still. The whole photography is gray and monotonous, and captured under unsteady direction, it's a messy looking endeavor.Emerging from Taken 2, I had but two questions looming in my head; one, why is Bryan Mills so good at saving his daughter from danger yet so inept when it comes to protecting her from danger in the first place? The other question is, how can twenty-nine year old (ahem, sixteen year old) Kim fail a driver's test yet be able to drive so fluently through the uncertain streets of Istanbul at top speed with bullets flying through her windshield? And don't get me started on the scene where her and Bryan crash through the US Embassy's booth...Starring: Liam Neeson, Famke Janssen, and Maggie Grace.

Straight Outta Compton," Go in walkin', but leave stompin'
","Even as a white kid from suburbia, I remember being exposed to the exhilarating and raucous sound of N.W.A. when I was four or five. My mother would play one of her brother's personally mixed CDs, filled with novelty songs, parodies, and vulgar rap songs I probably shouldn't have been heard at such a tender age, in car rides with me. Songs like 'Straight Outta Compton' and 'F*** the Police' were ingrained in my head, and I remember especially finding telling social relevance in the line, 'searchin' my car, lookin' for the product - thinking' every n**** is sellin' narcotics' from the latter song despite being so young.I may not have ever experienced racial injustice in my life, but I was at least aware of racial double standards at a young age. With that, one of the purposes of F. Gary Gray's biopic on the acclaimed, pioneering rap group N.W.A. is to get us angry at the injustice that occurred in the 1980's and 1990's and remind us that this kind of hate still frighteningly occurs today. It hits us in the face and stomps on the audience hard, as if its strapped with brass knuckles and decked out in the latest Nikes, portraying the race relations in Los Angeles as they were - ugly and disgraceful.This portrayal only fits that of N.W.A.'s music and character. Comprised of five talented, street-smart young men, N.W.A. was a rap group predicated on detailing their harsh reality and controversial opinions in a brutally honest manner. Featuring the lyrical talents of Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson, Jr., son of Ice Cube and a spitting image of his father), Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins), and Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell), in addition to the lyrical and producing talents of MC Ren (Aldis Hodge) and DJ Yella (Neil Brown, Jr.), N.W.A. went from a Compton area bunch to a nationwide supergroup in what seemed to be overnight. Armed with the guidance of acclaimed music producer Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) and their desire to rap the truth and the strength of street knowledge, 'Straight Outta Compton' details the rise of the group in addition to subsequent beefs, contract battles, and multiple tragedies that faced the talented young men in their prime.F. Gary Gray directs this film with complete conviction. He and writers Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff work to capture the major events in N.W.A. in a manner that, while all-encompassing, gets to the heart of each emotion and the significance of every conversation. Gray and company don't mess around in detailing the sure power and magnitude of this group through concerts, riots, and nationwide recognition, and they do so in a manner that's investing from the very first time the group is questioned by police for doing nothing wrong.'Straight Outta Compton,' again, much like the music of N.W.A., hooks you with its bravado and swagger. We see the incredible charisma and charm of these five men, we hear their hard-hitting lyricism and their strong production, and we feel their simultaneous pride for their city and condemnation of its flaws, such as systemic racism and discrimination. From Gray's assured direction, it continues with the performances, all of which unanimously strong. Eazy-E was a character I wasn't really expecting to see developed as much as he was, but with the writing at hand and Jason Mitchell's emotionally potent and tender performance, he becomes the standout in a sea of great acting.Each actor brings something to the table here; Jackson, Jr.'s aggression is unmatched, particularly in a telling scene involving Priority Records, Hawkins is the conviction and the even-tempered soul through all this madness, Hodge is the wit and the sporadic humor of the group, and Brown, Jr. is the backup to all the characters in the film whenever they need it. Mitchell is the tender and enigmatic one, someone who isn't easily defined, has trouble rapping and performing occasionally, but someone who also comes with big ideas for the group he knows, loves, and wants to make huge. Finally, let's not forget Giamatti, in his second Oscar-worthy performance (first being in 'Love & Mercy') of the year, who gives a performance just as emotionally investing and captivating as that of Mitchell's, particularly when the two are having a heart-to-heart.As entertainment, 'Straight Outta Compton,' for this past summer, is unmatchable in its level of fun and human interest. As social commentary, despite being set a few decades back, the film is frighteningly current in its issues and its ideas. While it may follow some typical tropes of a biopic (the 'rise and fall' structure), nonetheless, the sleekness and universal strength of everyone and everything in this project make it rise above those shortcomings into something truly worthwhile. Finally, as a piece of hip-hop history, and film in general, it's an indisputable must-see.",9,38,86,15 August 2015
The Woman in Black," The man in new shoes
","I see no way to do a review of The Woman in Black without making some sort of legitimate comparison to that of Hammer horror films. For those unaware, Hammer horror films were films made under the British label Hammer Films. They were predominately active from the 1950's to the 1970's producing a wide variety of low budget horror films featuring eerie atmospheres and recognizable characters like Dracula, for instance. Their films always had the cinematography down to a tune, not to mention usually incorporating some element of film noir and science fiction in for good measure, and the term 'Hammer horror' has been made synonymous over the years with stylistic efforts focusing on the lesser-shown pieces in the genre. Recently, in 2007 I believe, Hammer Films was revived and The Woman in Black marks one of the latest films from the company.It reminds me of Ti West's The Innkeepers, a horror film of the same breed just released this year. It was an exercise in the genre of slowburn horror, neglecting all of the glossy special effects and gory set pieces that we have grown accustomed to, and threw in some effective atmosphere and tonal suspense to create an unsung blend of eeriness. Unfortunately, the film still has yet to get the recognition it deserves, yet may retain the minor cult following it has eagerly adopted.The selling point for The Woman in Black is without a doubt, Daniel Radcliffe's name and after a decade of doing mostly Harry Potter films, only getting side-tracked by very small projects, he handles the role firmly and believably. I had a discussion with a friend on whether or not Radcliffe would fade away into nothing or would he continue to work on other projects. I quickly said that Hollywood will probably never let him stop working. He has such an ability to act with enigma, and never gives away too much or too little. He has grown up in front of the camera, dodging both harsh criticisms and media glorification. Will he ever be known as anything other than Harry Potter? That's a whole different subject. It would come as no surprise to me if he eventually made a film that would garner universal acclaim and land him a Best Actor win. Then maybe he would be known as that character. Or he will forever be the Mark Hammil of film.Paying delightful homage to the Hammer Films, The Woman in Black starts us off by introducing us to Arthur Kipps (Radcliffe), a studious lawyer, father of a four year old child manning down the fort after his wife's death during birth, and trying to live as collective a life as possible in Edwardian era England. Ultimately, to prove he is still a successful and capable worker, he accepts a job from his boss to manage the estate of the recently deceased Alice Drablow, who had lived with her husband, son, and her sister in the Eel Marsh House.Ostensibly, one could dub Arthur delusional. He consistently has visions of his wife and it isn't long before he begins to experience things of the supernatural nature in the Eel Marsh House. There is one scene in the second act that is about twenty minutes long of Arthur wandering around the house touching things, picking up knick-knacks and occasionally scared to death by a piercing noise or a sudden shift in the wind.This is not a study on Arthur's unknown condition as much as it is a study on the Eel Marsh House itself, its location, decor, atmosphere, and vibes it brings after the death of its owner. It is inevitable that your mind will drift during the film, due to the lack of movement and events, but sometimes, the terror will virtually gnaw at you until you give in and jump a few times.The Woman in Black is smarter than your average horror-fare, but is sometimes, literally, quietly incompetent. Its long patches of silence seem to be listless and it does come off as hokey and uneven more than it should. Still the sets are lovely, the music perfectly compliments the setting, and Radcliffe (who has to carry a lion's weight of the film) gives a strong performance, out of his comfort zone which was firmly placed into a character for over a decade. This is a solid and moderately strong effort in the genre.Starring: Daniel Radcliffe. Directed by: James Watkins.",8,0,1,23 May 2012
The Silence of the Lambs," Dr. Lecter will see you know...
","The Silence of the Lambs is one of the rare horror films that convinced much of the American public, and even the Academy Awards, that horror doesn't have to always be about gore, excess violence, and extremism. In fact, horror can stem from many different aspects, one of them being psychological, which is the subgenre that the film caters to. Through use of strong acting and an interesting story, the film manages to explain why it etched itself into the list of greatest American films ever made simply by existing and going what nobody thought its own genre could do.The film stars Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, who is pulled from her training at an FBI academy by Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn), who works for a unit in behavioral sciences. Jack grants Clarice the honor of meeting one-on-one with former psychiatrist and serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), who is also known for cannibalistic crimes. Lecter's knowledge is requested because of a serial killer nicknamed 'Buffalo Bill' currently running rampant in the streets, who is highly-publicized and known to skin the corpses of his female victims.Upon arriving at the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, Clarice meets a surprisingly mannered and well-articulate man that is Hannibal Lecter and not the psychotic murderer one would believe. What unravels is a strange relationship between an FBI trainee and an insane mental patient. Starling has to get close to Lecter for his knowledge and insight into the crimes of 'Buffalo Bill,' but also must refrain from dangerously close connections which could instantly spark something detrimental to her well-being.The first thing to marvel at with this film is how it utilizes its talent, plunging Foster and Hopkins into a story and set of circumstances that need to be well acted in order to be believable and gripping; both veteran talents do not slump here. Foster gives a very solid performance as Clarice, that is mostly successful at avoided the often alienating tropes that result when we focus on cops or undercover investigators for two hours. Then there's Hopkins, in a role he has become known for for good reason. Hopkins instantly clicks here as Lecter, provoking fright and unsettled nerves with viewers. Rather than over-the-top zaniness, Lecter relies on quiet, mannered acting techniques that are all the more frightening because of how out of the ordinary and unexpected they are from a man of his caliber. This leads the viewer to ping-pong back and forth with the idea that Lecter is really a misunderstood victim or an amazingly talented con-artist.Then there's the mounting tension on display here, largely thanks to Jonathan Demme's direction and Ted Tally's screenplay. The film plays like a true detective story, utilizing slowburn and patient tension in order to achieve a great, suspenseful result. These kinds of films hold up because they deliver something new each time one sees them. This being my first time viewing The Silence of the Lambs one gets the idea that even after seeing it, watching it again would be a great experience because it would allow you to pay more attention to the serene details of the film and how the end result came to be.With strong work behind the camera, and equally strong work in front, there's really no shock that The Silence of the Lambs came out the way it did, a strong and capable psychological thriller/horror film that beautifully relies on nuances and mannerisms rather than shock and awe. The fact that the film may have lead some to look at the horror genre with a bit more respect in the short-run would maybe be a stronger statement if horror didn't go south in the long-run. But that's another blog/review for another time.Starring: Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn, and Ted Levine. Directed by: Jonathan Demme.",8,3,5,4 May 2014
Fifty Shades of Grey," The blandest shades in a colorful portrait
","The film adaptation of 'Fifty Shades of Grey' is exactly the kind of film that makes me seriously question the tastes of the mainstream and the approach Hollywood utilizes in adapting bestselling novels into films. To cut through all the evasive language and answer those reading this review have, 'Fifty Shades of Grey' is a horribly mediocre film, timid and unsatisfying in its depiction of the bondage and BDSM subculture, with dialog and acting that are frequently astonishing in how awful they can be. Having never read the E.L. James' trilogy, I, the ignorant, take a look at the film adaptation and have to question, like I did with the film adaptations of the 'Hunger Games' trilogy and ask myself, 'is this really the root of the phenomenon?' Just by watching 'Fifty Shades of Grey,' an ignorant soul has to assume that this is a muted representation of the book. A juicy, erotic book about bondage, which was said to describe sex acts in explicit detail, had to have been more graphic than what we got on-screen, and the characters, I sincerely hope, had to be more than empty vessels, as they were in the film at hand. What we get for the film version of the book isn't a piece of work without merit, but a drearily boring and safe depiction of a topic and a culture that deserve more respect, especially given this film being the mainstream break for both.The story follows Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson), a depressingly ordinary college girl, who goes through life without many close friends outside her roommate leads an existence of convention and routine. This changes when her roommate asks her to interview Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan), an elusive, single billionaire who's consistent protection of his private life has warranted great question. From the moment she sees him, Anastasia is smitten with everything about him because he is everything she isn't: bold, confident, unafraid, and suave.One can tell just from the way Christian looks and speaks to Anastasia, having great patience and acceptance with her that he admires her for her own traits as well: she's simple, frightened, vulnerable, and just the kind of girl he's looking for. The two quietly hit it off, with Christian requesting simple things like coffee outings and simple hangouts before going through one of his many periods of being standoffish and confusing to Anastasia. Eventually, he reveals his motives; he's looking for a sexual relationship with no commitments and no conventionality in terms of going on dates. He wants sex and he wants it his way, proposing a contract to Anastasia in hopes she will become the submissive to his dominant, in which she'll stay at his spacious penthouse on weekends to engage in wild sexual escapades.I love the idea of 'Fifty Shades of Grey' being made into a film because it would make a topic that is so taboo and mainstream and force it into the limelight, optimistically making it something that more people would talk about. I was immediately frustrated when it was given an R rating, greatly limiting the impact of its presumably explicit sex scenes and resulting in a failed opportunity to also make the NC-17 more commercial and profitable (but that's another argument). To begin with, the sex scenes are a hair more graphic than what mainstream America is used to, but they're depressingly ordinary compared to what kind of emotions usually arise from BDSM activity. There isn't a lot to say with the scenes, surprisingly, and that's the biggest issue with them from the start.Johnson and Dornan fit their roles pretty well, in terms of accentuating the traits they need to and giving off the kind of vibes they need to as well. However, the two completely lack any kind of chemistry together. Maybe that's intentional, again alluding to Grey's refusal to make this a relationship of any conventionality, but it's difficult to get wrapped up in the sex scenes when both parties seem disinterested in one another and bored. Furthermore, the acting of the two leads varies from acceptable to incredibly poor and contrived, leading to the final nail in the coffin being the film's dialog.'Fifty Shades of Grey' may go down as one of the most poorly-written films of the film year in terms of having singular lines of dialog that are capable of producing unintentional laughs and sneers. Lines like 'laters, baby,' which Grey always says to Anastasia, 'I'm fifty shades of f***** up,' as said by Grey, and a multitude of others that need greater context are uttered to cringe-worthy effect. Combine the element of brazenly bad dialog with unremarkable sex scenes and an an overall vapid portrayal of a sex subculture, and you have a film that flatlines when it should captivate and stun.The film, as I stated, isn't without its own merit. The cinematography is bleak but paradoxically inviting, with Seamus McGarvey making the color gray about as vibrant as it can be, so much so that infusing other colors effectively changes the mood of the audience as it does the characters. The contrast established between the characters functioning in the outside world and the characters functioning behind clothes doors is present, and McGarvey communicates that very well through look and tone, with screenwriter Kelly Marcel (writer of 'Saving Mr. Banks') effectively doing it in dialog. Furthermore, the way the film creates a world established by these two characters that is left mostly uncorrupted by the opinions and interference of outside forces also helps it in establishing a level ground in its own world. But such features are secondary to the primary features, which should've been a lot more fleshed out and detailed than what was provided in a lackluster portrayal of an exciting idea.",4,4,13,14 February 2015
Win Win," Miniseries format, but film worthy in every way
","So many films have been lost in the shuffle this year, and have gone on to be unrecognized and already forgotten gems. The Art of Getting By and Cedar Rapids just to name a few. Win Win was a sleeper hit, even with its great supporting cast, electrifying script, and some of the most surreal filmmaking for a drama in recent memory.Win Win almost reminds me of a possible HBO miniseries condensed into a film. This seems like it could make a decent Television show for a premium cable network. It tells the story of lawyer and part-time wrestling coach named Mike (Giamatti) who is put in charge of caring for an elderly man named Leo (Young). So he doesn't have to do much work at all, Mike puts Leo in a nursing home, but continues to collect the $1,500 check every month for doing work he doesn't do.Mike's wrestling team is pitiful, until he starts caring for Leo's nephew named Kyle (Shaffer), a troubled teen who finds his niche when he begins wrestling for Mike's team. Kyle's homelife is found later to be dreadful, and begins to shake up Mike's simple life as he tries to manage him while care for his loving wife and two kids.The supporting cast of Win Win is pitch-perfect packed with character actors like Bobby Cannavale and Jeffrey Tambor. Every character is played in a non-perfect manor, because the screenplay gives them believable flaws they can't work around. Instead of making them all good human beings, the film gives them baggage that they must work with. It shows the realism behind life, and not the sugarcoated film look we've been getting for quite sometime.There are flaws, sadly. For one, we never know why Mike steals the check every month because we don't know his financial situation. If that could've been elaborated, it would've spawned a whole new breed of conflicts for the film to work on rather than just make Mike look cold-hearted and scummy. Not to mention, some things in the film are symbolic, like the boiler room, that are never mentioned again and are just the subject of creative screen writing. It doesn't really transfer to film well, and it's never referred back to for future reference.Alex Schaffer reminds me of the real Lucas Cruinkshank, who is famous for the 'FRED' character on Youtube. He resembles Cruinkshank, and even speaks like him without the pitch effect on his voice. From what I've heard, his hair was bleached for the film to make him look even more troubled and a stand-out. Shaffer is perfect in the film, and probably the strongest point. He wrestles better than he acts, but at least we have a multi-talented child-actor who has developed skills early on. Being this is his first film, and he's already very talented for his age, it can only get better - hopefully.Win Win is seldom, much like Director Thomas McCarthy's previous works. He has a sort of art with the camera, as well as with a pen and paper. He creates real characters, and none of a cliché breed. There are no major twists and turns in the plot, but some caught me off guard surprisingly. Win Win isn't perfect, but it's above-average, which I'll take over cliché and fair any day.Starring: Paul Giamatti, Alex Schaffer, Bobby Cannavale, Jeffrey Tambor, Burt Young, and Amy Ryan.

The Dark Knight Rises," Hey, you there, in the ordinary clothes!
","In 2005, we saw Christopher Nolan reboot Batman's origins with a deep, intricate film, giving us a collective history on the character from orphaned-child to crime fighting hero. In 2008, we saw a surprisingly fantastic sequel, that is often considered to be one of the best superhero films ever made. Now it's 2012, and Nolan has openly concluded his dazzling trilogy with The Dark Knight Rises, an effective piece of entertainment, very kinetic, worthy, and intriguing.To keep the storyline as general as possible, it is eight years after the events of The Joker and Harvey Dent left Gotham City ostensibly irreversible in its damage. Now, crime in Gotham has decreased tremendously under the Dent Act, in memory of the town's former governor, Harvey Dent, who is now their posthumous hero. Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) has drifted into a reclusive soul, barring a bathrobe and slippers, walking with the assistance of a cane, and is so far off his game, he fails to even see the blunt signs of the conniving and devious Selina Kyle, known as Catwoman (Anne Hathaway).It isn't long before another villain comes into play, named Bane (Tom Hardy), who tries to pry Gotham City out of its newly found peaceful nature and is determined to spread anarchy as far as the eye can see. He sports a metal mask, concealing his mouth, and delivers some of the most eerily satisfying monologues that are on-par with The Joker's tomfoolery seen in The Dark Knight. I am also a big fan of his voice that, unlike Bale's Batman voice (which is pleasantly shoved to the side in this film), is a more authentic replication of a comic book character's voice. It sounds robotic and heartless, as it should, and it doesn't sound fake or put-on, like Bale's.Inevitably, I feel Hardy won't get the recognition he deserves for playing Bane, as I mentioned prior in my review of The Dark Knight, no matter what Nolan will choose to do the series or what route to take, it will always be remembered by the iconic performance of the late Heath Ledger.The film occasionally comments on many issues of the world, such as violent terrorism when showcasing the encounters of Bane and his team of goons, the financial blows to the country, including a fantastic hold-up scene near the beginning of the picture, and a view on society that can seen as a commentary relevant to today's uncertain times.The Dark Knight Rises, unfortunately, starts off on the wrong foot, bombarding us with new faces, developing them in a hazy manner. We get introductions to many characters, including Joseph Gordon-Levitt's John Blake, a rookie cop, and while the film knows it wants to incorporate two sneaky villains, it has a hard time giving both of them valuable screen time and substance. It seems to sometimes become lost and crushed under the weight of its monologues, which are occasionally overlong and over-written.For a film about the caped-crusader himself, it should also be noted that he makes very few appearances in the film, and to me, that's not a bad thing. Nolan ends his trilogy in a much more coherent way, wiser than the conclusions to other past sagas, such as Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 3. While that picture knew how to accomplish things visually, it struggled to balance its three villains, its hero's alter-ego, and the pending love interest that continued to burden its hero, Peter Parker. The Nolan Brothers, Chris and John, who penned the screenplay to this film, wisely choose to center much of the action on the heroes out of costume, giving a more real approach to the undefined definition of a 'superhero film.' We see Batman as his alter ego, Bruce Wayne for most of the film, showing that he is a hero regardless of the gear he sports.One thing we neglect to learn are Bane's motives behind his devilish attacks, one of which is the explosion of a football stadium, which is captivating and stylish, much like the rest of the film. Never do we dive into his backstory, or Catwoman's, as more than just 'they do it because they're evil.' It's unfortunate after watching The Joker, who instantaneously presented himself as a fleshed-out villain. Not to mention, Hans Zimmer's score, which was put to great use in the original Dark Knight, is bombastic and sometimes very distracting, sort of becoming hard on the ears after a while. This is coming from someone who has never been too caught up in the story of Batman's origins and, likely, I'm one of the few with this complaint. If you can simply immerse yourself into this epic, than this will probably not bother you in the slightest.The Dark Knight Rises sometimes meanders and after 164 minutes of relentless action and monologues, one will definitely need a break and some time to take in everything they were just handed. While the film begins in a shaky manner, it pulls itself together quickly, delivering a visual cacophony of beauty and style, especially in its last twenty-five minutes that are profound and invigorating. Considering this film had to live up to nearly impossible hype and still manages to come out standing on two feet, it is still a success in my eyes.NOTE: The twist ending put a big smile on my face too, seeing as originally, I was very upset by one of Nolan's origin decisions.Starring: Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Anne Hathaway, Tom Hardy, Marion Cotillard, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Morgan Freeman.

Iron Man," 'Has he lost his mind?'
","Iron Man is one of the only superheros I can find myself completely loving and admiring, up there only with Peter Parker. Few characters, in my opinions, are as interesting as their superheros, and as far as film-portrayals go, Tony Stark and Peter Parker have been treated with excellence and respect. Christopher Nolan's Batman series was a monstrous success, but I didn't find myself caring much for Bruce Wayne as a person. I saw him as more than a shell, but had no real passionate, human connection with him that would seem like a personal relationship. It's not a fault of Nolan's filmmaking or actor Christian Bale himself, I just didn't find much personal investment with Wayne.Parker and Stark bring a more recognizable, forceful energy to their legacies. Parker's charming geekiness, naivety, and understandable anguish during his time as Spider-Man provided me with total joy and excitement. In contrast, Stark brings a different energy to the table, a collective, narcissistic one that I usually loathe. And yet Robert Downey Jr. Makes no missteps as playing this kind of cocky, self-indulgent character. He comes off as a force of total energy, making his cockiness actually kind of charming and elegant.Downey Jr. is a big part at why Jon Favreau's Iron Man is such a big success. I always look at superhero epics as character studies before special effect showcases, which some may find to be irrelevant and rather expecting of me. The way I see it, if you plan to make a film based on a specific hero, you are required to give back story, character development, insight, and a reason for the viewer to care about him and hope for him to succeed. Favreau does this and more as Iron Man is one of the best superhero films of the new decade, exciting, perilous, uncompromising, and simply a joyous experience.The film concerns Stark's rise from astronomically intelligent philanthropist/playboy persona to a crime-fighting, high-flying superman in an enormous, full-body iron-suit. There's also explicit detail in the relationships of Stark's life, one being Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts, his highly-competent assistant, and Jeff Bridges' Obadiah Stane, his business partner. There's an equal balance between character relations and satisfying action, and neither plod along or become unearthly long. Favreau is smart about his placement and vision; Iron Man is shot and conducted on a grandiose scale, uncompromising in its clarity and visually arresting in its imagery. One of the most common things I see in superhero epics is their hunger for enormous sequences and their struggle to achieve that. Here, the film simply doesn't know how to fail and that's a huge strength.Several scenes show the complexity of Stark's mentally draining process to become Iron Man. Stark's energy very much comes out here, especially when he's faced with criticism from people like Pepper and Obadiah. His unfathomable intelligence and cocky exterior makes up for a somewhat present feeling of inferiority. It subtly seems that Stark uses defense mechanisms such as cockiness to make up for feelings that he may not live up to the expectations brought forth by his father.Yet this is not a pity story or a disposable action film. This is a promising picture, with mesmerizing action sequences, plotpoints that deserve your investment, characters that earn their business to be liked, and a film that deserves a viewing on your part. Iron Man hardly ever missteps; it's as dynamic and as confident as its title character.Starring: Robert Downey Jr., Terrence Howard, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Jeff Bridges.

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Grim to the point of breeding contempt, lacking in excitement, and an overwhelming feeling you've seen it all before
","I may indeed be the only one who finds it fascinating that both 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' and 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2' are released on the same weekend. The former is a heavily hyped film that has the ambition to finally kick off the DC Extended Universe while the universe's competitor likely doesn't even see them in its rearview mirror, and the latter is a sequel to a romantic comedy from fourteen years ago. The reason these releases are so germane is that both are highly likely not to leave much of an impact on pop culture, and that even accounts for the original 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding,' which, despite boasting the title of the 'highest grossing romantic comedy of all time,' left no footprint either.I only mention this because the idea of Batman squaring off in an epic battle against Superman, in a time where comic book movies are more popular and some are more subversive than ever, with a nine-figure pricetag is something that should've been the battle of the ages. A remarkable duel between two of society's most beloved heroes that should've enthusiastically set up a universe. However, this is a film that will come and go like few superhero films of the last decade, I predict. This is a remarkably bleak letdown of a film, grim to the point of being effectively joyless, bloated and crippled by trying to serve as too many components to the stalled development of a universe, and unexciting while boasting one of the most exciting battles in movie history.The film takes place eighteen months after the events of 'Man of Steel,' another horribly forgettable picture, where Superman (Henry Cavill) has become a hot topic of debate, so much so that even Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) can't stand the very sight and idea of him after he defeated General Zod, thanks to the onslaught of chaos he brought to Metropolis. Superman, however, cannot stand Batman and works to expose him while continuing to work for 'The Daily Planet' newspaper as journalist Clark Kent.Meanwhile, LexCorp's new frontman Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) finds Superman to be the biggest threat facing humanity today and works with Senator June Finch (Holly Hunter) to help him recover Kryptonite in order to defeat the caped vigilante. This would also involve working to replicate the late Zod's DNA in order to help Lex wage a battle between two of the greatest heroes in history: a battle between man and God.Much has been made about the casting of Ben Affleck and Batman, and just to get that note out of the way, he's fine, and does a comparable amount of brooding to Christian Bale's Batman. Henry Cavill is still a relatively lesser presence mainly because, like Superman in general, his character is very archetypal and predicated upon moral good, two things that don't go over too well in a new age of superhero films based upon gloom and doom. And that's exactly what 'Batman v Superman' is, two hours of nonstop gloom and doom that effectively robs the film of any conceivable excitement and momentum one had going into this picture.The film is unbelievably murky, and unlike with Christopher Nolan's 'Batman' trilogy, where character interest and relationships were pushed to the forefront with a superhero story existing in the background, this film can't keep either one straight. There's too much clutter that makes this film a bloated work of sonic noise and narrative exhaustion, such as the repeated focus on Eisenberg's convincing but wayward performance of the loose cannon Lex Luthor, in addition to questionable and rather unnecessary emphases on Bruce Wayne's schizophrenic dream cycle. Both are just perplexing additions to a film where its title could serve as a plot description.But the biggest problem facing screenwriters Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer is how much weight they have placed on this very film. While trying to serve as a followup to 'Man of Steel,' Terrio and Goyer also try to make this film stand on its own while foreshadow the upcoming Justice League film. This means including Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) in on the chaos in the middle of the third act, as well as highlight Aquaman, Cyborg, and The Flash in cameos, making for a film that's crippled by a to-do list the lengthy of a grocery shopping list. I'm reminded of how 'Spider-Man 3' found itself drowning in so many things to include that the only thing left to marvel was the visual scheme.And even with that, 'Batman v Superman''s visual palette is so unattractive it winds up significantly lessening the excitement on-screen. By the time we get to the actual fight between our two titular heroes, a combination of fatigue and the idea that we've seen it all before coupled with the gray and black visuals sets in and makes for a film that underwhelms in nearly every sense.'Batman v Superman' may indeed be one of the biggest letdowns of the year, save for a nicely handled conclusion and a memorable performance by Eisenberg, who seven months ago was a stoner superhero before becoming a psychotic supervillain. It packs everything we've become so accustomed to in superhero films, leaving nothing special for this particular installment, in addition to its grimness breeding contempt and an appalling lack of excitement and its agenda being cluttered to the point of alienation. Chalk up DC as 0-2 going into one of the biggest moves of the brand's existence.",4,45,95,25 March 2016
The Emperor's New Groove," Puts many newcomers to shame
","It is truly amazing what stemmed from The Emperor's New Groove, which at one point seemed like a doomed project. Originally titled Emperor in the Sun, the film was going to focus on a selfish emperor who optimistically switched positions with a peasant look-a-like who would later become the target of an evil witch's plan. She was going to summon a dark spirit to block out the sun to prevent her from aging, almost like a retelling of Dorian Gray.The film developed an untold amount of stress for everyone involved. Producer Randy Fullmer was aggravated that production was moving at a snail's pace and was consistently rushing director, at that time, Roger Allers to speed along, offering him no extensions. The project had to be done as fast as possible in order to meet the strict summer 2000 deadline. Out of options, Disney hired the director Mark Dindal, who had worked on the musical Cats Don't Dance, one of the few animated films not to boast the Disney label, and both him and Allers developed very different story lines for the same film, one focusing on comedy (Dindal's) and one heavy drama and morals (Allers).At the end of the day, Fullmer denied Allers an extension and he abandoned the project, leaving all the weight on Dindal's shoulders. The project did not make the summer 2000 deadline, but went on to be released during the wintertime of that same year, something one must applaud considering the treacherous state it was in for so long. What Dindal managed to do to a project that looked to be a lost cause from there on out is truly astonishing, proving that even the dustiest pieces of work can be polished off to look good. The Emperor's New Groove is a delightful film, occupying a concise runtime, unstoppable action scenes, and fierce and interesting characters rarely striking a wrong note.The story focuses on Emperor Kuzco (voiced by David Spade), the selfish, manipulating emperor of the Inca Empire. After firing his adviser, Yzma (Kitt), her and her dim-witted assistant Kronk (Patrick Warburton, who also voices Joe Swanson from Family Guy) concoct a scheme to kill the Emperor by making him drink a poisonous potion. During a staged dinner, the potion gets switched and Kuzco is turned into an unattractive llama. Hidden inside the bag of Pacha (Goodman), one of the Emperor's peasants, the two realize they must work together, despite being on opposite ends of the food chain, to try and get Kuzco his position back.It is pretty clear that the 'he was a selfish man' story has been well-played out. It was just six years after this that the Pixar film Cars modified the formula and injected it with a nostalgic rush to put it to use. The story is moved along by its refusal to provide a heavy-handed moral or become bogged down with complications from such a simplistic story. This is a genial exercise in smooth, involving animated filmmaking, moved along by its action and its instantly lovable characters.Also, there is something nice about returning to the wholesomeness of an animated picture from the early 2000's. Ever since the creation of full length CGI pictures, which all started with Toy Story in 1995, it appears hand drawn animation and claymation have been unfortunately pushed to the side, while the easier way is taken out. I love CGI animated features, especially the ones from Pixar, but really, how much of the candy-coated colors and the overly cheery atmosphere can you healthily stomach? The early 2000's animation is one of the few successful hybrids, perfectly blending the simplicity of animation with the digitized color enhanced textures.This is also an elegant reminder to parents and teens who enjoy nostalgia that 3D is a tainted gimmick. Here, the characters pretty much gleefully jump off the screen as if boundaries have been shredded, and they are so lively even without the dim colors or the extra dimension. This is the kind of animated feature Disney should be striving for, and they would be much closer to their competition at Pixar.The Emperor's New Groove is animated slapstick, and functions inside such a rare formula so well. It is elegantly voice acted, expertly animated, and it is nothing but surprising that a picture that one seemed doomed has now gone on to be such a remarkable picture.Voiced by: David Spade, John Goodman, Eartha Kitt, and Patrick Warburton.

Bruce Almighty," When a sketch would've done justice to the material at hand...
","Bruce Almighty could very well be the one film where Jim Carrey gives everything he's got, making a character so over-the-top and goofy that it would go on to be one of his best performances. Not in my eyes. From the first few frames with Jim Carrey's character, I knew this endeavor may not go so well and, sure enough, I was correct. It has taken me a long time to warm to Carrey the same way I've warned to actors such as Jack Black, but his crazy personality is something that has left me quite annoyed in many of his films. Upon seeing it, I was a little disappointed by how bumbling and idiotic both him and Jeff Daniels were in Dumb and Dumber, yet the film now seems to be one of Carrey's stronger works when put under the same light as this film.To put it simply, this is a tired comedy exercise, unsuccessfully blending its religious premise with slapstick, and tacking on mawkish sentimentality making the last thirty minutes a gooey slog to watch. We follow Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey), a second-rate reporter for a news station in Buffalo, New York, who has just lost an open anchoring positioning to Evan Baxter (Steve Carell), the conniving, smarmy man who loves one-upping Bruce. Frustrated and angry, Bruce throws a fit while interviewing people at Niagara Falls, costing him his job, which causes him to yell at his wife (Jennifer Aniston) and focus all his blame on God for shifting focus on him.Bruce then receives persistent pager messages from an unknown number, which he begins to ignore, until caving in and realizing that it requests him to go to a deserted warehouse to meet the one and only God (Morgan Freeman), who tells Bruce that keeping up with several pray requests and helping out so many in need is a difficult job that is often taken advantage of or under-appreciated on the grandscale. He then gives Bruce his position, equipping him with all the divine powers (IE: walking on water and possessing the ability to accurately imitate people), and the unprecedented, unearthly responsibility of keeping those in touch with their faith happy and joyous.But before we get into the sentiment, let's explore the infinite comic possibilities of Jim Carrey being God. In the relative beginning of the film, to end off of Bruce's bad day at work, he is beaten up by a group of local thugs when he attempts to protect a harmless bum. When Bruce now possesses powers, he intimidates the thugs and the one thug makes some sort of comment involving 'monkeys flying out of his butt' and you can bet your bottom dollar Bruce makes it happen in a ridiculously unfunny scene that channels the worst comic tendencies of a PG-13 screenplay. It too doesn't help that Bruce's character is an ungrateful man of little charm and so much zaniness that he induces a headache every time his mouth opens.There's Carrey's hyperactive tendencies, and just the obligatory fact that this story practically extracts every laugh and every tear (there will be audiences, quite possibly those who are religious, but not enough to where they can't laugh at the form of satire) with a premise that basically concocts this very anemic, tired tale of redemption and 'putting yourself in the shoes of the person you criticize.' This is the third time director Tom Shadyac and Jim Carrey have collaborated on a film, with the first two being Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and Liar Liar. Both films expressed Carrey's style with the same rabble-rousing, uncontrolled behavior this one showcases, but with more of an emphasis on humor and spontaneous enjoyment rather than heavy-handed religious satire. I also learn it took three people to pen this story, Steve Koren, Mark O'Keefe, and Steve Oedekerk. One thing I could've guaranteed from the start, if I knew the writers, was a nice emotional third act, which Koren churned out to his advantage in Click but in a too little, too late fashion in A Thousand Words. Those films centered Adam Sandler and Eddie Murphy, respectively, in their madness, where this one victimizes Jim Carrey showing that he can be funny, if taken in smaller doses.Yet I can see devoted fans of Carrey's anarchic comedy embracing this film with an open mind and a willingness to laugh. There's a larger audience for this film than I can estimate, yet in the small world of satirical comedies with religion in their crosshairs, I can assume why studios aren't cranking out more of them, and I don't believe controversy is the prime reason.Starring: Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Aniston, and Philip Baker Hall.

Toy Story 3," The animation is wonderous, as well as the story
","It's hard to keep a franchise going for three movies and still stay fresh simultaneously and Toy Story 3 shows its still possible. The Pixar geniuses return to their first film to have a sequel (let alone two) and they succeed in giving it their true magic that is rare in new animated films. Pixar has always made wonderful, artsy films that not only express a great message and feel, but they express great color and animation to them as well. The first Toy Story came out in 1995 making it Pixar's first film all around and it seemed that after Toy Story came out, hand drawn animation laid in it's grave while a new age of CGI animation started dominating the market and revolutionized a whole new era of movies. The sequel as well.Even if you have seen one but not the other, you seem to already know the characters and even if you don't, the movie basically says 'Hey we have made you wait eleven years, here's an introduction.' Though this film takes on more of a parody element, prison like film and seems targeted to the audience that were like 1 or 2 when the first hit theaters. Plus they have adult humor with prison escapes that keep the parents interested. Though some jokes were a little too childlike and maybe would have got to the true Toy Story fans who were in middle school when the first one got a release. Now they would obviously be in their twenties and quickly lose interest in this film. And though Pixars films can be cliché and non-suspenseful because you know the characters will find a way out of it. This one still keeps you in suspense.The plot is about Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz (Tim Allen), and the rest of the toy gang figuring out that Andy is going to College and needs to pack what he wants to take, what he wants to toss, and what he wants in the attic. By mistake (and a lot of fun actions) they instead go to Sunnyside Day Care Center where they meet other toys and the seemingly nice owner by the name of Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear (Lotso). In the mean time Woody escapes Sunnyside by luck and wants to find his way back to Andy's. He makes his way back to Sunnyside to go to his friends and just in time when the gang finds out of Lotso's evil and his plans to treat them like prisoners. The rest of the film is devoted to focusing on the gang's (genius) plans to get out of Sunnyside and to escape Lotso's clutches.The movie is simplistic, but yet genius at the same time. The ways the characters find ways to hide from adults is hilarious, clever, and unique. Its also nice to note that the opening short film, Day & Night was just as amusing as the entire film. It brings out the creativeness and art in Pixar and even shows that people of all differences can come together and be happy. Its one of the better shorts they have done, even with a simple concept. I'd give it a three and a half out of four stars.Its also interesting to note that the voice of Slinky Dog (Jim Varney) and Lenny and Wheezy (Joe Ranft) have both died since Toy Story 2 came out. Ranft's last role was in the Pixar success (and my favorite of their films), Cars as the fire truck 'Red'. Varney's was Daddy and Then and was replaced with Blake Clark for the voice of Slinky and Lenny and Wheezy were simply written out of the story. Though the movie brings mention of some older characters from the previous films. So overall, this film is amazing and he even though it out hand drawn animation in it's grave, it brought in a whole new world of art. Plus it would be odd to see Toy Story in the hand drawn era.Starring: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, Ned Beatty, Don Rickles, Michael Keaton, Blake Clark, Wallace Shawn, and John Ratzenberger.

Space Jam," Authentic fun on everyone's behalf
","NOTE: This film was recommended to me by Ryan Clevenger for 'Steve Pulaski Sees It.' Living in Illinois, Space Jam is a film that hits the tender spots of the last two generations; one generation that got to experience Michael Jordan's unfathomable legacy as arguably the greatest basketball player who ever lived, and the other, mine, that reflects on his legacy through highlights and documentaries to keep the memory of such an all-star alive. Jordan's legacy didn't stop at on-court talent, as he was one of the most marketed athletes of his time and helped popularize the NBA, let alone the Chicago Bulls, on a previously unforeseen international level.If we remove the nostalgia factor from Space Jam, which is a very difficult thing to do by the way, then the film serves as Jordan's versatility. After retiring from the NBA at a relatively young age to pursue a career in baseball, Jordan only became more of a fascinating person, in addition to someone with impeccable charisma. Space Jam exists as a response to Jordan's departure from the NBA to the MLB, as the Looney Tune gang of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Tweety Bird, Sylvester the Cat, Porky Pig, and Lola Bunny all call Jordan out of retirement when they challenge a group of intergalactic invaders from 'Moron Mountain' to a basketball game in exchange for the planet.The Looney Tunes thing this will be an easy win, until the aliens from Moron Mountain, who are relatively puny in size and strength, find a way to steal the talents of star basketball players like Charles Barkley and Larry Johnson and become the 'Monstars' of the court. Meanwhile, Jordan agrees to play for the Looney Tunes team, but it takes all of the five minutes of practice to show that the team is disproportionately talented towards Jordan. As a result, the team indulges in some aggressive training tactics to beat the Monstars and save the planet.As an amalgamation of live-action and animation, especially in an age where Pixar was coming on the scene and traditional animation was soon to be phased out, Space Jam is bright and vivid. The real-life characters of Michael Jordan, Wayne Knight, who has an amusing role, like he always does, Larry Bird, and even Bill Murray's interactions with the animated characters of Bugs Bunny and the like in a convincing, believable manner. The result is a beautifully colored and nicely executed mix of whimsy.Because both worlds of reality and animation are explored here, Space Jam has the luxury of being a film that can go beyond traditional boundaries of a sports film, and the Looney Tunes are no better characters to incite such zaniness. The animated bunch are quick-witted and ecstatic, and Jordan is clearly doing this for fun and excitement rather than a phoned-in project or another endorsement. Had Space Jam been more of a lackluster cash-in, sports fans and Jordan fans would've seen it from a mile away and dismissed the film immediately. However, because everyone involved recognizes what a zany project this is, they don't try to fight the lunacy, but instead, play along, and that provides us, the audience, with a wickedly entertaining stride into a lively sports film that is so fun you almost, almost miss the clichéd underdog element.Starring: Michael Jordan, Wayne Knight, Bill Murray, and Larry Bird.

Before Sunrise," The impact and idea of time and the power of human connection explored in one beautiful package
","The kind of connection the two lead characters in Before Sunrise merit is the kind of connection I've only managed to achieve a few times in my life; it's the connection with someone who is a complete stranger, but as soon as you meet him, your wall of protection and tact almost completely crumbles. You feel compelled to share personal information with this stranger, deep thoughts that no one other than you have pondered or heard, and talk until your throat is raw about everything you can think of in that given moment. Your become verbally diuretic, and after it's over, you're upset that the conversation has ended, but you've achieved a state of personal tranquility thanks to a release of all that was on your mind that you are at a sort of bliss. It's a strange thing to articulate, and those who have had that kind of connection know precisely what I'm talking about. To those who can't pinpoint that kind of connection (if you have to think hard about it, you've probably never had one), you're in for one soon.Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise, which kickstarted a trilogy that spanned the course of three separate decades and analyzed Linklater's favorite cinematic idea, time, is an ode to that kind of comfortable, life-affirming connection we all should experience. Linklater thankfully devotes an entire film to that kind of connection, making a film entirely focused on characters rather than the events, the location, or the supporting characters surrounding them. It's as if Linklater got fed up at watching interesting characters, their motivations and their potentials, in other films squandered so other, more trivial matters could be attended to. In Before Sunrise, he strips down everything to two central characters and their views on a variety of different issues, philosophical ideas, and past experiences.Those two characters are Jesse and Céline (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy), who, from the moment they meet on a train-car from Budapest heading to Vienna, they reveal personal details and personal opinions on love, romance, and just their general upbringings. When Jesse's stop at Vienna finally rolls around, he convinces Céline to hop off the train with him, to which she throws caution to the wind and obliges. The two divulge in a great deal of personal matters together; he is a romantic soul masquerading as a cynic after breaking up with his girlfriend, the whole reason he's in Vienna in the first place, and she has fallen before and is cautious about doing so again. The two, however, recognize their separate agendas and treat this night as their one and only encounter, leading them to get personal and loquacious with one-another while walking through the entire city.As stated, Linklater strips this film back a plethora of layers to simply being about these two characters. Linklater even limits pictorial distractions, as the two characters walking through the city of Vienna leaves for a great deal of possibility to stumble upon something distracting. That occurs, if I remember correctly, once in the film, and it's incorporated so well into the discussion and the flow that you're bound to miss it. It's no lie that Linklater has seriously found himself committed to making this project about this simple yet unbelievably affecting kind of connection, which, in this case, transcends personal bounds into becoming romantic, leading the characters to question how they feel and how they want to proceed.Hawke and Delpy, I feel, aren't doing much acting here; part of me feels they're conveying their own kind of presences to one another and that there's little effort required on their part to change who they are or become something they are not. The film also bears the necessary pacing element of being lax and carefree, never rushing these characters onto the next setup nor making them take detours for comedy's sake. This is Linklater driving the truck down a path that has many different routes and he chooses the most direct route, and simultaneously, the most beautiful and mystifying.Before Sunrise beautifully illustrates the power of human connection through two strong performers and a writer/director obsessed with the impact and idea of time and the realism and the aforementioned kind of connection. Here, he displays his affinity and talent for both through a film that is equal parts contemplative in a philosophical sense and also incredibly beautiful on a human scale. This is a romantic comedy for people who have grown sick and tired of falsified, picturesque romantic comedies and hunger for something genuine, real, and lasting, much like the impact of these characters' relationship with one another in the film.Starring: Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy.

Signs," Wooden and hollow, sort of like the door the aliens can't pass
","M. Night Shyamalan has become the butt of every person's movie joke with his consistently preposterous films, his unusual casting, and his own name. Like every director, I believe he can make a well made, approachable film, but Signs is one of the biggest patient-testing thrillers I've come to know. It's an overwrought, frivolous exercise and a belligerent kick to the science fiction genre and those who aspire to work in the field.Shyamalan has effortlessly created one of the most unpleasant and meretricious films this side of the Earth. It begins when Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), a former priest, awakens to hear his daughter, Bo (Abigail Breslin) screaming outside in his cornfield. Graham and his brother, currently living with them, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) race outside to find Graham's son Morgan (Rory Culkin) and daughter staring blankly into a crushed area of corn, laying flat in a perfectly round circle. Their suspicion grows as rumors of extraterrestrial lifeforms have inhabited our planet and are looking to take over civilization as we know it.Graham and Merrill have been manning down the fort at home since Graham's wife was killed after being pinned to a tree by a man who had fallen asleep at the window. There is a scene where Graham and the man (played by Shyamalan himself) have an awkward discussion by the side of the road. It is an incredibly insensitive, strangely written scene, with the Shyamalan character reciting some of the worst written dialog in a scene supposed to occupy emotional importance. But that is only one of countless details the film neglects to build on or explain.The film tries to erect credible, memorable suspense by giving us close to an hour of buildup. I normally commend a film when this happens because I believe it provides the writer's talent to come forth, is one of the biggest and strongest building blocks to a great thriller, and is too often traded for things of a lesser breed. Here, the dialog is painfully slow, which leads to scenes progressing at a staggeringly incompetent pace, and every line of dialog is recited in a hushed, melodramatic sort of whisper that it becomes dreary and impotent abnormally fast.When we are finally met with the unworldly lifeforms (and trust me, they're not too exciting and their presence is kept at a minimum) we are greeted with one of the most colossal curveballs (not in a good way) and insulting miscalculations I have yet to see in a thriller. The aliens are said to have traveled light years through space and time, built ships of strong stature (which can be assumed since they can perfectly smash a healthy section of corn), and have successfully created a plan, they hope, will allow them to take over our planet. And they're allergic to water. I hate to build on this complaint, seeing as so many other people this side of the IMDb/Rotten Tomatoes forums have voiced criticisms have done so, but it truly not only strikes me as odd but incredibly unbelievable - even for a sci-fi film, where the suspension of disbelief is almost required for every film in the genre.How are the aliens supposed to survive on a planet that is two-thirds water? Where every breath you take has some moisture in it? It is also stated from Mel Gibson in one of the most laughably unbelievable lines in many a moon that the aliens 'seem to have trouble with pantry doors.' Yes. They are allergic to water and can't bypass an ordinary wooden door. Which leads me to another question; if the aliens plan to take over the Earth, you'd assume they'd need weapons, right? You can't go around the planet inconveniently landing in people's cornrows and crushing a good crop? If the aliens, presumably, have weapons on board that they could destroy the Earth with, don't you think the same weapons could be used to assist in bypassing a wooden door? It baffles me the negligence towards logic this movie partook in. Signs is a maddening affront to thriller and science-fiction films that try to create characters, atmosphere, and an original storyline, that are left to wallow in exhaust from the unexpected take off of other films of the same genre. I will say the film provides us with good cinematography, but completely disregards it so we can see more of the film's attempts at needless style and inconsistencies more noticeable than a perfect circle in your crops. I've always thought it would be virtually impossible to round up four or more capable performers in a picture and find almost nothing interesting to do with them, or even make an attempt to note their presence, but Signs has definitely proved me wrong.Starring: Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin, and Abigail Breslin.

Identity," Stand up and be identified
","If one were to scan the confines of films released in the 2000's decade, they might be surprised at the barrage of horror and thrillers that were either released to minimal viewing, or endured success in the theater never to be spoken about again. Identity falls into the second category, and sadly, I don't believe, enjoyed the acclaim it deserves. It is a crafty thriller, in a world where few exist. It succeeds in areas usually left untouched in other thrillers. And its third act doesn't leave off on a botched cliffhanger.It is a dark and stormy night in Nevada. We see a family of three drive along an empty road before getting a flat. The man (McGinley) and the woman (Kenzle) get out of the car to attend to it and it isn't long before a limousine driver (Cusack) taxiing a brash and brazen actress (Mornay) strikes the woman, knocking her out and leaving her bleeding uncontrollably. While this is happening, the couples' kid (Loehr) witnesses it all.The road is flooded both ways, so the gang winds up heading to a seamy motel, run by John Hawkes in a well nuanced performance. Throughout the night, numerous other people show up at the motel such as Ray Liotta, whose character is transporting a convict to another prison, a prostitute (Peet), and a newlywed couple (Duvall and Scott). They believe that their presence in the same motel on the same night is a coincidence, until more information is revealed.All of this seems to be fine, until people start disappearing one by one. Experienced moviegoers may discover who it is before most. I was expecting Identity to have a great first act, an intriguing second act, but a phoned-in, cliché-ridden third act. On the contrary; every act in Identity is taken care of and the writing throughout the film is polished ecstatically.The performances are not overacted, with probably the one of the hour coming from John Cusack; an actor who I've always been pleased with. He captures the role of the everyman extremely well, and always seems to play the character who is sophisticated and tries to keep everyone controlled and collective. I think between Identity and 1408, he always has had problems with motels.Identity is a crafty, and well-done thriller, motivated by lively performances, slick writing, and a final act that wraps everything together nicely. It goes on the shelf not side-by-side cheap, inferior thrillers, but next to films like Jeepers Creepers and Joy Ride. I like to call this shelf 'underrated and unsung.' Starring: John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, Alfred Molina, Clea DuVall, Rebecca De Mornay, John Hawkes, John C. McGinley, William Lee Scott, Jake Busey, Pruitt Taylor Vince, and Bret Loehr.

Fantastic Mr. Fox," We continue to care for the foxes in this film, even when they do get into deep cuss
","I always thought it was a delight to see a director step out of their comfort zone and direct a film they usually don't touch. Kevin Smith did with Red State, Martin Scorsese does it every film, but one of his most noticeable was Hugo, and now, Wes Anderson takes his indelible quirkiness and injects it into the pleasant animated film, Fantastic Mr. Fox.I hope everyone at some point read a book by Roald Dahl, whether it was Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, this, James and the Giant Peach, or The Witches. It seems almost all children were acquainted with his books at one point or another. Authors like that become etched into school curriculum. Joining Dahl can be the late Maurice Sendak, Beverly Clearly, or perhaps, for elementary-schoolers, the author of Holes and the Wayside series, Louis Sachar.Fantastic Mr. Fox presents us with the story of Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney), his wife, Felicity (Meryl Streep), and their twelve-year-old son, Ash (Jason Schwartzman). Mr. Fox is having a difficult time remaining collective since, well, he's a wild fox. Being that the tree that live in is very close to factories run by strict farmers and Mr. Fox has urges that desperately need to be fulfilled, him and his pal, Kylie Sven Opposum (Wallace Wolodarsky) decide they should try and steal produce from their farm. This becomes a recurring habit, and eventually leads to a war between the farmers and the burrowing foxes.The film is occupies a delightful elegance in its stop motion animation. Its characters, right down to the fur on their backs, are animated with rich and inviting colors, as well as the sets they live in clearly being meticulously detailed. The style is primitive and great to look at, and provides us with a different form of animated entertainment instead of Pixar, Dreamworks, and Disney monopolizing the field.One positive is that the film doesn't become buried under its own quirkiness so much so that we care little about the characters, which tends to happen in many of Wes Anderson's other pictures. What we have is a solid script, taken a step further than usual, along with big name actors subtly providing the voices behind these characters, so as not to throw in our face what big stars the movie has, and we continue to care for the foxes in this film, even when they do get into deep cuss.Voiced by: George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Eric Chase Anderson, Bill Murray, and Owen Wilson.

X2: X-Men United," Bears the grace and charm of a comic book
","X2: X-Men United plays, feels, and consistently moves with the grace and charm of a comic book, and that's about the highest compliment one could pay to a film of the superhero genre. Riddled with sublime special effects, some characters we can further invest in, and drama and subtext that is further elaborated to provide for a viewing that requires us to keep our brains on, if you catch my drift.The story reacquaints us to Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and his team of loyal X-Men, who fight for the idea that humans and mutants, those with extraordinary, life-altering powers, can live harmoniously together. However, there has been a great deal of anti-mutant ideology being peddled by Congress and the general public, specifically lead by Col. William Stryker (Brian Cox). Stryker pushes for a mutant genocide, believing that humans shouldn't have to share their planet with mutants in any way.Of course this calls for some form of combat, which is where our uncanny X-Men come in. The clawed-Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), the easily-underestimated Storm (Halle Berry), the telekinetic Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), and the shy but imitable Rogue (Anna Paquin) attempt to lay to rest these ideas, and also, once again, stop Magneto (Iran McKellen) from yet another bout of attempting to have mutants control the universe Much of X2's success is attributable to the talent of director Bryan Singer, who pulls most of the same punches he used to get the first film off the ground. The only difference is with X2 is that he does things a little bit bigger in size and scope, with larger action setpieces, new characters to meet, and the characters we already met being further expanded for stronger character depth.The special effects, for me, are what stood out more in this second installment. Singer never missed a beat when it came to filming large, grandscale action in the original X-Men and never does he misstep here. Singer's action, combined with the strong editing work of John Ottman and Elliot Graham, possesses a rare fluency to it, where action exists as something to look forward to and utilize in addition to character development, plot, and thematic resonance. Too often is it utilized and exploited in place of those things rather than working harmoniously with the additional devices - like humans and mutants should.It also helps that the look of the film is crisp and clean thanks to cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel. Sigel captures everything Singer wants to include in X2 with a beautiful look and style, effectively mirroring the camaraderie on screen with the aesthetic, appeal, and kinetic movement of a comic book. The film doesn't go for the similar, more blatant style of comic book mimicking as seen in Ang Lee's Hulk, which would release theatrically about a month later than X2, which attempted to create the feel by using the picture-in-picture method. Yet, both films find ways to succeed using their own style, with Singer and Sigel's route to a comic book providing for consistent fun and enjoyment.On a film note, one cannot neglect the performances at hand here. Jackman, once again, works well at playing a character we find it difficult to have sympathy for at times, while at others, being effortlessly fun and likable. Paquin still nails the subtle facial and body communications of Rogue, while Berry and Janssen continue to fit well in their assigned roles. Throw in Ian McKellen for good measure and you have a complete package for X2 After watching the first two installments of the X-Men franchise, the sole word I can conjure up is 'impressive.' Who would've thought that two films concerning mutants, bearing a heavy emphasis on special effects but not neglecting the human element of the story nor the thematic ideas of discrimination, would live up even after a decade? The fact that the first two X-Men films possess more elements than incredible, bombastic special effects ensures a longer lifespan than your average blockbuster, many of which have a hard time bringing much else besides their looks to the table.Starring: Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, Anna Paquin, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, James Marsden, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Alan Cumming, Brian Cox, and Bruce Davison.

Amélie," A beautiful, but empty, candy wrapper
","Amélie is a film predicated off of a whimsical color pattern - consisting mostly of urine-yellows, pea-greens, and blood-reds - and an impossibly fantastical world with a unique presence at its core. It opens by defining the characters that surround our protagonist Amélie Poulain (the uniquely beautiful Audrey Tautou) by their strangest, most peculiar quirks; one character gets deep enjoyment out of using his fingers to elaborately dissect the hot carcus of a turkey and another character's greatest pleasure is emptying our her purse just to put everything back again. In the grand scheme, these quirks are fairly minor, but the fact that these are the traits screenwriter Guillaume Laurant wants us to immediately associate these characters with - not a job, a specific education, a personality trait, or a personal history - is, in itself, a tad subversive.With that, we finally meet Amélie, a woman who was kept largely sheltered as a child, being homeschooled by her now-dead mother and, as a result, learning to escape monotony and certain gloom by running away in the realms of her imagination. Working as a waittress at the Café des 2 Moulins in Montmartre, France, Amélie has consistently led a fairly isolated life largely focused on herself, until one day, her motivations change in the blink of an eye. Upon hearing the breaking news report concerning the death of Princess Diana, she drops the cap to her perfume, which rolls and eventually dislodges a loose tile. Behind the tile is a small tin of trinkets, presumably belonging to a young child. Amélie decides it was something of her destiny to find this box and return it to the rightful owner, and before long, she finds her destiny of helping others panning out with another circumstance of a lost item. The significance and contents of said lost items are irrelevant; their purpose is to, in turn, provide Amélie with something she never had before and that something is a reason to exist and belong. Throughout her life, while not depressed nor particularly sad, Amélie's loneliness has been a constant thing she's had to battle in her day-to-day actions; it's been the typical daily occurrence of her to wake up, go to work, and relish in her alone time for years on end. These situations allow her to search for some kind of companionship, further develop her love for humankind, and find maybe even find a romantic partner.Of course, I'm making this sound a lot more extravagant than I think I should be. Amélie, through all its color and decorated mise-en- scene, is a drearily familiar story with its original element being the fact that it's captured in a realm of artificiality that, in turn, makes it appear far more compelling than it ever manages to naturally be. It reminds me of the lesser films of Wes Anderson, which weren't so much concerned about how many objects, costumes, and people could be fixed into one particular frame, or the general excitement of dialog as much as they were presentation and eccentric dialog. While the visuals in Amélie are colorful marbles, and the juxtaposition of characters with cinematographical color (the work of the great Bruno Delbonnel, who'd go on to work with the Coen brothers and Tim Burton in more recent years) is unmistakable, these efforts feel more geared to disguise the fact that Amélie is a relatively simple story with little in the way of remarkable themes. The presence of scenes ostensibly colored by way of a filter over the lens, canted angles (most notably during a scene showcasing a character named Bredoteau's most traumatic moment as a child), and lavish setpieces almost entirely blind us by whimsy and warmth until we realize the takeaway from the film is that of an empty candy wrapper.There's something to be said about Tautou, however, who remains an interesting screen presence throughout the film simply because of her presentation. Her jet-black hair, petite figure, frequently blood- red wardrobe and lipstick, and ghostly paleness make her protrude out in nearly every scene, even if the background is a pulsating hue of red - as it is in a scene when she reads a letter in a bathroom. In addition, scenes in the sex shop bring a fascinating level of warmth to a place often condemned and avoided for its almost inherent seaminess. But just like I find myself doing now, one winds up remembering Amélie for short, eye-catching scenes rather than a complete film with an impacting takeaway.Starring: Audrey Tautou and Mathieu Kassovitz.

Moonrise Kingdom," A rare Wes Anderson extravaganza
","Consistent readers of the past few weeks will know that I have successfully watched almost every one of Wes Anderson's films, and his two shorts, Bottle Rocket and Hotel Chevalier, respectively. I conclude my odyssey with one of incorruptible beauty, style, and substantial material. Moonrise Kingdom is an effervescent experience for moviegoers, seemingly existing in its own little world, unlike the last two Wes Anderson films that seemed to be firmly set in a specific, recognizable place, whether it be the ocean or the charming atmosphere of India. This feels like it has erected a world from scratch and its laws and rules from places of heavy beauty.We are greeted with instantaneously likable, precocious children, and if Anderson were to produce a sequel (thoroughly doubt it, too many quirks and new worlds to create and time is fleeting) it would most likely focus on them as morose, unkempt adults approaching a heavy midlife crisis. In a way, it feels a bit like The Royal Tenenbaums, if we were presented with extensive backstory on the Margot character and why she became so depressed and mentally unfulfilled. For once, I believe Anderson wanted to focus on characters when they are happy with their current place in life.Yet the melancholic urges of the director come into play when it is possible that these two spunky twelve year olds may not be allowed to be together. They are Sam Shakusky (Jared Gilman) and Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward). Sam is a 'Khaki Scout' member at the unusual Camp Ivanhoe on a small and modest island of New England, and Suzy is summering with her dysfunctional and incompetent attorney parents (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand). Their love is so crisp, real, and so beyond their years, yet is not simple lust. It is definitely something more. A mutual understanding is still a tad bit of an understatement.When the counselors at Ivanhoe get word Sam has escaped, they organize a search party, led by Bruce Willis's welcomed Captain Sharp, and eventually round up Tilda Swinton's saucy Social Service executive to join the hunt. Sam and Suzy were pen pals for about a year, before sneaking out of their confines to meet each other. They have come heavily prepared and are destined to lead a life of happiness - hopefully.Anderson, per usual, not only comes prepared with his band of regulars in his casting, but also equips his keen eye for painstaking detail and colors. Here, much of the photography consists of sunlit, grassy plains, evocative shots of the sky as it hovers over the graceful landscapes, and a mountain of beauty occupying every scene in the picture. The framing is astute, the colors are there, including his trademark love for the color red, and everything feels at home here. Sometimes, it is hard to subitize everything on screen. This is the first Anderson picture not to feature Owen Wilson in any specific credit, but he goes on record saying that he was on set frequently, gave advice on the screenplay, and assisted in a lot of the feedback for the rough cuts of the picture. His presence is here, just very muted and missable.It also seems Anderson has incorporated some great morals in the film, as well. They are all executed perfectly, and mainly center on the typical 'young love' premise, but replace clichés and convention with quirks and eccentricities, present the topic of physical and mental escapism maturely, in way of gratitude, and showcase the drastically distant standpoints between the parents and the child.Moonrise Kingdom impresses me more than Anderson's previous efforts, and ranks right behind The Royal Tenenbaums for my favorite film by him. There's some very crafty filmmaking going on here, per usual, but some of his efforts, Bottle Rocket and The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou for example, seem a tad meretricious. They are beautiful films that exfoliate their photography and look, but wind up shunning the humanity aspect I so ever hunger for as a cinephile. There needs to be some sort of a connection with these characters, and only sometimes we can acceptably be deprived of that during impressionistic filmmaking. Wes Anderson's films aren't impressionistic, and usually, have no hard moral behind any of them (not a bad thing, despite sounding like one). Sometimes, he spends so much effort on the painstaking detail and look of it all that he forgets we must spend an upwards of one hundred or even two hours watching characters through a pretty indistinct lens. Moonrise recognizes humanity and knows how to apply it. We care about these characters from the first frame to the last.NOTE: The film's soundtrack is probably the best composed out of all his films. It features several tunes by the country legend Hank Williams, who also happens to be one of my favorite singers. We hear the infectious tune of 'Kaw Liga' in two or three scenes during the film, as well as some other ones collectively forced into background harmonies. Yet this is shaping out to be a better tribute to him than The Last Ride, his upcoming biopic, looks to be. Though it would be nice to see little Sam and Suzy set the woods on fire.Starring: Jared Gilman, Kara Hayward, Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman, and Bob Balaban.

The Producers," This is where comedic subjectivity is affirmed.
","There comes a time in every critic's life, be it newspaper critic or online critic, syndicated or local, hobbyist or elitist, when he watches a highly-regarded classic for the first time and feels underwhelmed by it. He proceeds to write a not-so positive review of the film and what follows is a long-run of neverending hate-mail about the comment for the rest of his career. If that's what my review of Mel Brooks' The Producers brings so be it. This isn't my first rodeo with not liking a relatively high- regarded classic. I proved not to be such a big fan of Easy Rider, the classic road movie that portrayed sixties culture in a way many found profound and accurate. My main reason for not loving that particular picture is because I found it 'spoke to a generation that no longer had ears to hear it,' and unless you're from the generation when big political and social changes began to take effect, chance are, it was an alienating and sometimes tedious film to indulge in.That's a whole different complaint than the one about to make for Brooks' The Producers. Given Brooks limitless track record for uproariously funny and subversive comedies of yesteryear, I felt popping in almost any one of his films would be an immediate winner. The bottom line with The Producers is it's simply not that funny and never that interesting. Concerning a hack producer named Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) and his neurotic accountant Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder), the film follows the two halfwits as they attempt to conjure up a travesty of a play when they run the math and realize that a bomb could work better for a producer than a hit in terms of shares and rights solicitation. In efforts to produce a play that is destined to play for one night only, Max and Leo right and produce 'Springtime for Hitler: A Gay Romp with Adolf and Eva at Berchtesgaden,' a work that is labeled 'a love letter to Hitler' written by an ex-Nazi Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars), which is German for 'Frank Lovechild.' The play turns out to be a musical, and to assure nothing but total and unprecedented chaos, the two producers decide to follow every step in the 'what not to do' section in the unwritten book of performance art. They hire the wrong director, the wrong actors, pick the worst and potentially most offensive story, and find a writer who is four tires short of a car. Mel Brooks does just about everything he can against the wall with The Producers and it's surprising and a shame to admit so very little of the humor actually sticks. To begin with, it's no denying Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder are extremely talented performers, but somehow, Brooks found the way to make both extremely tired, irritating, and tedious. This especially goes for Wilder, whose over-the- top neurosis exhausts itself well past the perimeters of being funny. Mostel, on the other hand, occasionally hits admirable strides, but his character is so blatantly selfish that it's difficult to watch him for very long let alone to side with him.Furthermore, the ideas of satire are barely noticeable here - something the film should've set its sights on heavily. Instead, we get frequent vignettes of situations that aren't very funny simply because they're burdened by overacting and boring physical comedy. I never knew the latter words went together. Mostel and Wilder both have unbearable characters and, in return, give us somewhat unbearable performances.Brooks has made a name for himself as one of comedy's great voice and, through some mystery far beyond anything I'm willing to conjure up at the moment, The Producers has become a staple in the comedy genre. It has earned its place on the American Film Institute's one- hundred best comedy films among many film critics' favorites as well. I conclude by saying that I don't expect my opinions to be agreed with or shared but at the very least respected. Sometimes I feel comedy is the most subjective of all genres because one thing that makes somebody laugh can make someone else uncomfortable or annoyed. The funny thing is I've seen films very similar to The Producers hit considerable highs. I suppose I'm just trying to figure out where it all went wrong here.Starring: Zero Mostel, Gene Wilder, and Kenneth Mars. Directed by: Mel Brooks.",4,4,6,9 March 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," May knock some back down to Earth, but will lift up others to that special place they haven't been in a while
","Few franchises are as cherished and as glorious as Star Wars. Since its release in 1977, it has been passed down by hardcore fans to their children in the form of repeated viewings on VHS or DVD like a precious family heirloom, or has simply found itself etched in a young child's mind with no help from their parents. My generation endured the often tarnished prequels, but even if you're somebody who despises the franchise's prequels and embraces 'the original trilogy,' think about that; you dislike one-half of the series, but you still have the nerve to call yourself a Star Wars fan. That's because the Star Wars characters, universe, and experience transcends a few subpar films; it's something that reminds us why we go see films in the first place and how they can completely transport us out of our element for an experience that we'll always hold dear to our hearts and cherish until we pass.There will undoubtedly be people quick to praise Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens as the best film in the series, or even second to The Empire Strikes Back, and there will be the hardcore fans that will simply not allow themselves to enjoy it for whatever reasons exist under the sun. For me, as a casual fan of the franchise, I wanted a compelling cast of new characters, the same kind of enriching and unique environments I had been graced with in prior installments, a desire on the screenwriters' behalf to propel things forward and not dwell on nostalgia and past events, and offer up some new thrills in a modern, but classic package.If you go into Star Wars: The Force Awakens expecting that, I'm convinced you will get it and emerge satisfied. The film may not have the kind of warmth and tingly feelings you got when you first witnessed the original Star Wars film in the theaters, on VHS, or in one of its theatrical re-releases. Through a lens that packs confidence and lacks flare, J.J. Abrams continues the franchise in a respectful and commendable way.To keep the plot's description as vague as possible, the film takes place roughly thirty years after the events of Return of the Jedi, where Luke Skywalker has disappeared and the galaxy is left dominated by the First Order, the successor to the Galactic Empire, and the Resistance, both trying to find Luke's whereabouts. We focus on a Stormtrooper nicknamed Finn (John Boyega), who escapes the First Order with a Resistance pilot named Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), along with BB-8, a small, round droid. Their ultimate goal is to destroy the First Order, which is commanded by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who uses the dark side of the force to command and conquer. Later in the film, Finn teams up with a scavenger named Rey (Daisy Ridley), in addition to both Han Solo (Harrison Ford reprising his iconic role) and Chewbacca in efforts to defeat Ren and take back the Galactic Empire.To begin with, in an effort most likely geared to try to disassociate this project from the often tarnished prequels, Abrams takes the safe route in structuring The Force Awakens's narrative in a manner very similar to A New Hope. The chronological events of attacks, character development and introductions, and cause-and-effect relationships all mirror the film that started it all, and this isn't a bad thing, frankly. To try and hatch a new experimental structure to a film that's already going to be approached very cautiously by fans who are fearful of the Disney brand now stamped on all future Star Wars projects and products is a very risky move, and Abrams does a great job at playing safe, yet still delivering.This isn't to say that Abrams and his cowriters Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt cling to a railing for support and safety the entire time; in fact, making the leading male in the film black and the other lead a woman is a high-point for the film, especially given how engaging these characters are. Boyega gives one of the most naturally charismatic and engaging performances I've yet to see in a Star Wars film, full of energy and not one-liners or quips that distract from the story at hand. Ridley, too, finds herself being a very believable presence, especially when tasked with carrying much of the emotional weight in the last act. Finally, let's not sleep on Oscar Isaac, who, this year alone, has had performances range from business tycoons, laidback but sinister scientists, and now a key role in one of the most renowned franchises in history. As with nearly every project he has been in, don't sleep on him here, either.Star Wars: The Force Awakens, in addition to being the best-acted installment of the original franchise, also happens to be one of the most exhilarating action spectacles of the year. With the effects being delightful blends of CGI and practical effects, the feel the film carries throughout mixes the old and the new with great results. The film doesn't bear the laborious and often artificial looks of recent blockbusters like Godzilla or Jurassic World, but it doesn't look poorly or inexpensively assembled either. This is an incomparably detailed film, especially during the first hour, when it's essentially the best sound and lights show you could ask for.I came for an experience and I was wholly satisfied having witnessed what I did before I walked out. This is a film that will likely inspire and captivate a good majority of its audience, and remind them why they love films in the first place. It's a lovely blend of old and new that doesn't rely on nostalgia to carry its story, and offers viewers a new breed of likable souls to carry this franchise to galaxies even farther and farther away, perhaps next time to uncharted territory.",8,12,35,18 December 2015
Flight," A roller-coaster with no tracks
","Let me give you this situation; you're on a plane, everything is going smoothly until the plane begins to fail and suddenly you're on a nosedive down to earth, plunging at an increasing rate. Let's say the pilot pulls off a miraculous move, turning the plane completely upside down, before turning right-side up, making a rough but sufficient landing in a wide open field, that saves your life and dozens of others. It is later discovered that he was severely under the influence that day when flying the plane; would you take legal action, or would you be grateful to still be breathing? That's one of the many moral dilemmas in Robert Zemeckis' Flight, a terrifically exhilarating film, hitting all the right notes as a thriller and as a complex drama. Left to carry a lion's weight of the film, as usual, is Denzel Washington as the plane's captain William 'Whip' Whitaker, a man who has battled severe alcohol and drug dependency for many years, even losing his wife and teenage son because of his choice to continue drinking heavily. After he manages to miraculously land the seemingly doomed aircraft, he awakens in the hospital to find numerous news stations and people regarding him as a hero. What those people do not know are the behind-the-scenes instances that make up a large part of the Whip Whitaker who climbed into the cockpit to fly that plane.Toxicology reports taken from all five of the crew members on board the aircraft show that no one had any alcohol in their system except for Whip, who also put two shooters of vodka in his orange juice he was drinking while flying the plane. We see him before the film in a clearly rattled hotel room with a naked flight attendant as he is informed he will need to fly a plane in a matter of hours. Two cocaine lines and a sip of vodka later, he is out the door. The men who go through hell and high-water to hopefully skew this information from getting to the public and helping Whip remain a free man are attorney Hugh Lang (Don Cheadle) and airline union representative Charlie Anderson (Bruce Greenwood). While they're helping Whip more than anyone, the one supplying motivation and, not to mention, some drugs and alcohol is his best friend Harling Mays, played by an enthusiastically lax John Goodman, in one of his funniest performances in years.The film's main subplot deals with a drug addicted woman named Nicole (Kelly Reilly), who is simply trying to get her life back on track after an accidental heroin overdose that left her nearly dead. One night, she speaks to Whip in a stairwell in the hospital, after both find each other sneaking out for a cigarette as they both exchange innocuous words about their life and why they're here. He serves as not a guardian angel to Nicole, but a person she can keep in her mind who is going through a similar time in their life.This is Robert Zemeckis' first live-action film since Cast Away in 2000, after tackling monumental motion-capture animated projects such as The Polar Express, Beowulf, A Christmas Carol, and Mars Needs Moms, and without a doubt the most confident, assured work he has done behind the camera since Forrest Gump. Zemeckis takes the five minute scene of the plane crash in progress, rarely turning away from these characters during this time, and completely turning up the intensity and feeling of peril to make the most enthralling sequence of the year. I thought I felt intense and shaken after watching the plane crash in Final Destination and The Grey, and boy did I feel relieved during the plane sequence in Argo, but never have I felt so gripped, riveted, and restless during a scene this same year.A large part of the praise for this film not only goes to Zemeckis' professional direction but Denzel Washington's sophisticated, nuanced performance as a man trying to cope with internal demons and personal grief. A friend informed me before I was off to see this film that the plane crash would only last so long and then would likely become a courtroom potboiler. What is too marvelous is how Flight avoids that execution but will not avoid that stereotype by those who haven't seen it.I end on the note that this will be a difficult film to watch for many, many people; some of whom, I believe, will be turned off by the trailer if they were personally effected by addiction or they were effected because of a loved one who had an addiction. Flight pulls no punches at simplifying the process of substance abuse, and certainly doesn't pretend that getting clean is an easy road to go down. It shows its lead character as a deeply troubled man, who falsely believes he has everything under control and believes he, like in the plane, is the one manning his system, when in reality, he's, again, like the plane, on a roller-coaster with no tracks.To end things and to try and sum this up simply and effectively, Flight is an enormously effective human drama, with terrifying sequences of peril, smoothly conceived scenes of emotion, fleshed out characters, wonderful performances (those by Cheadle and Goodman are sure to go under the radar), and the writing by John Gatins (of Real Steel fame) is extraordinarily sufficient and detailed.Starring: Denzel Washington, Don Cheadle, Kelly Reilly, John Goodman, Bruce Greenwood, Melissa Leo, and Nadine Velazquez.

Final Destination," Might have you yelling 'oooh,' 'oh!,' and other things at the screen
","What makes Final Destination rise above other films of its horror genre is there is no designated killer. It's all just a series of 'accidents' triggered by an non-present force. It's crafty, campy, and of a different breed. It's smart, stylistic, without being too over-the-top. The only scene I can think of in this film that pushes the limit is the scene where one person is strangled to death. It's clear the screenwriter pondered on how force can strangle someone.This is another horror film where you don't know how to feel when watching it. Tense? Scared? Freaked? Sadistic? Excited? When I saw this film, around the age of seven, I was nothing but amazed. I kept trying to figure out what the hell was making these things fall and what was leading these people to die. When I watched movies, up until around ten, I truly didn't pay attention to any dialog (odd now how I brutally critique films that lack it), I just went along for the ride.Alex Browning (Sawa) is going on a class trip on a red-eye flight to Paris. Just before take-off, Alex has a brutal premonition where the plane explodes, and everyone dies. Upon awakening, Alex, like anyone, is freaked out and his panic causes classmates an orphan Clear (Larter), his bestfriend Tod (Donella), the teacher Ms. Valerie Lewton (Cloke), his rival Carter (Smith), Carter's girlfriend Terry (Detmer) and goof-off Billy (Scott).Sure enough, the plane explodes in a fiery burst killing everyone. Alex, now realizes, he has an unprecedented ability to vision an accident before it occurs. Now, the people who made the lucky attempt to get off, and dodge death, are now killed off one by one in the order they would've died on the plane. The order I won't spoil because they explain it thoroughly (and I mean thoroughly) in the film.Over the years, the dialog in this film has gotten more attention by me. First it was about the deaths, then I listened to information that was around the deaths (like a few minutes before it would happen), then I would go crazy researching the film to get every pinpoint detail on the film before going back to watching it with my undivided attention. I was a mess. I loved the film. I loved every frame of it. Loved its dare to be different style of film-making, and loved every character, even the antagonist bully.There are some movies you can't put a price on and Final Destination is the one for me. Despite its questionable premise, it tackles it in a fantastic, and enjoyable manor. It doesn't get too comical (you can save that for the fourth film), and even though you could see sequels in the film's headlights, you anticipate them to be just as good as the first if the film sticks to its formula, limits its comedy, and has believable, realistic deaths.Starring: Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, Kristen Cloke, Kerr Smith, Chad Donella, Seann William Scott, Amanda Detmer, and Tony Todd.

Rear Window," The right thriller at the right time
","The opening shot Alfred Hitchcock's masterwork Rear Window is a chilling one; one that shows off the film's bold colors, common setting, and artistic voyeurism. It simply shows the small courtyard outside that can be viewed through the rear windows of the Greenwich Village in Lower Manhattan, specifically James Stewart's character's, as the bright red blinds roll up, revealing each individual section of the window. Playing in the background is a peaceful score and after about one minute and forty seconds of credits and a static camera, Hitchcock moves us outside that window, showing us the sights of the village's backyard. From flower beds, to cats lounging around, to a dog being transported from the top balcony to the ground below, etc, the sight is familiar and commonplace to this specific setting. After a few minutes of a relaxing and almost romantic stroll through the wonders of Greenwich's backyard we meet out main character.His name is L.B. 'Jeff' Jefferies (James Stewart), a professional photographed now confined to a wheelchair after breaking his leg. He remains in his apartment during a brutal heatwave, where he and his neighbors keep their windows open all day and night. Jeff passes the time by watching his neighbors go about their daily routines; one of which is a young, attractive dancer he cleverly names 'Miss Torso', a woman who often sits all by her lonesome, a pianist, a sculptor, and Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), a traveling jewelry salesman with a wife confined to her bedroom because of an illness.Jeff frequently gets visits from his wealthy and gorgeous girlfriend Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly), but while the two have notable chemistry and know how to take care of each other well, Jeff simply views her as too perfect. He confesses this to Stella (Thelma Ritter), the sassy, home-care nurse he has been assigned to and states how he would much rather have a woman with more visible flaws than one who seems to ooze perfection and gorgeousness with every step she makes.One night, however, this thought becomes nothing but a faint memory when Jeff awakes to the sound of a woman screaming and glass breaking. The noise comes from Thorwald's apartment, the apartment directly across from Jeff's rear window. Jeff then sees Thorwald leaving his home and is troubled by the sudden disappearance of Thorwald's wife over the next few days. Frequent spying and self-contemplation (along with bouncing the ideas off of the heads of Lisa and Stella) leads Jeff to arrive at the conclusion that Thorwald murdered his wife for reasons unknown to him. He then spends long hours watching Thorwald's every move, trying to arrive at a sensible conclusion for an action that is unjustifiable.Hitchcock achieves the power and impact necessary for a film like this thanks to his act of making the audience a voyeur in their own right. We can judge Jeff about snooping and eavesdropping on his neighbors all we want, but are we looking away during the film? Are we the ones covering our eyes when Jeff pulls out binoculars to see across the courtyard? If not, and we're criticizing him for his actions, we are not only hypocrites but we are condemning ourselves and our own actions. We are disagreeing with our own practices and not even recognizing them.Hitchcock leaves us with this uncomfortable feeling of seeing something we're really not supposed to or overhearing things that weren't intended for our ears. This kind of filmmaking is wonderful, especially for the time when audiences were most often used to being in a place of comfort. Films of the fifties, like Singin' in the Rain, offered a happier escape and put us in a place of joyful exuberance. Hitchcock dared to make us feel uncomfortable and make us feel unsettled at all times. He utilized lengthy shots, establishing a mood by showing off all the simple, day-to-day occurrences in a typical courtyard in America. These lengthy shots are key to the film's success. The only thing better than Jeff and Lisa conversing about everyday life or their relationship is when the scenes do the talking for us and that's key to Rear Window's success. It keeps a simple story relatively basic but also dares to let us experience the environment without the burden of chatter.Every Hitchcock film has, what he has dubbed, a 'MacGuffin,' or something tangible (or intangible) that the characters in the film are searching for that we, the audience, may or may not care about. The MacGuffin here is simply proof, proof in favor of Jeff's case. With this MacGuffin, the audience is put in an odd place. We want Jeff to achieve the satisfaction of him being able to prove his case and not be made a fool of, but we also want this all to be a misunderstanding and find that Thorwald's wife isn't really dead. The way Hitchcock goes about trying to give us a two-faced MacGuffin is enticing entertainment.Rear Window is invigorating with tremendous features that make thrillers interesting. From lengthy shots, to great performances, to an interesting premise, and the idea of repercussions arising from unintentional actions. My knowledge and resume for Hitchcock films is depressingly low for a cinephile, and seeing Rear Window was a 'right place at the right time' event considering my relatively low faith in modern thrillers and crime capers.Starring: James Stewart, Grace Kelly, Thelma Ritter, Wendell Corey, and Raymond Burr. Directed by: Alfred Hitchcock.",10,0,1,9 December 2013
A Night at the Roxbury," The excitement, once again, alludes me
","We can thank producer Lorne Michaels for giving us such wonderful comedies like both the Wayne's World films, but we can also blame him for giving other Saturday Night Live characters their due in feature-length films when some of them barely had the charisma to carry two minute long sketches. From The Ladies Man to Superstar to MacGruber to now A Night at the Roxbury, Michaels has sought out each Saturday Night Live character and exhausted every opportunity that could be done with the character.Whether or not that's a good thing or a bad thing is your opinion, but in my own humble one, each one of these SNL films has been a mediocre, less-than-average affair, with A Night at the Roxbury easily cementing itself as the worst film from the long-running sketch comedy series thus far. This is one of the most grueling comedies I've seen in quite a while; one that seemingly struggles to concoct a coherent plot and instead resorts to cheap skits that cobble themselves together and frequently punctuate themselves with the agonizing tune 'What is Love' by Haddaway.This combined with the abysmal ratings makes it hard to believe that Will Ferrell became a sizable star after allowing this film to be his debut leading role. However, not long after the release of this film did Ferrell find ways to make his absurdist-style of humor known and demanded throughout the world. But when it comes to A Night at the Roxbury, both Ferrell and Chris Kattan find ways to be grating and dimwitted to the point where comedy doesn't even seem to register on the radar.Ferrell and Kattan play the brainless Butabi brothers, Steve and Doug, two young club-freaks who have a love for hard-partying. The only issue is that both of the morons never seem to get access to their desired club, the L.A.-based Roxbury due to the club's love for high-profile celebrities over the common people. By day, Steve and Doug mindlessly slave away, running their family-owned fake plant store, anxiously anticipating all the night has to offer.The plot kicks in when the van Steve and Doug are driving to The Roxbury is rear-ended by 21 Jump Street's Richard Grieco, who agrees to allow them access to the elusive nightclub in hopes the two don't press charges for the fender-bender. Finally, Steve and Doug no longer have to live in the shadows of their favorite club and can be one with the party. A subplot also involves the woman who works next door to the plant-store named Emily (Molly Shannon) at a lamp store, cutely named 'Bright Idea.' The brothers' father blatantly hopes that Steve will wise up one day and marry Emily so that the wall between the two stores can be demolished, effectively creating the first ever plant/lamp store.So A Night at the Roxbury goes on, doing what I thought was impossible in the regard that it makes seventy-seven minutes feel like an unreasonable, laborious amount of time for a film. With the notable exceptions of The Blues Brothers and the two Wayne's World films, each SNL-adaptation has run into this issue, only proving that these particular characters, setups, and instances were never originally intended to sustain feature-length but rather two to three minutes on an hour-long sketch show. And even at their original intention and length, I don't find these particular characters funny. The opening credits show them forcefully gyrating against women and frantically dancing in a crowded nightclub, illustrating pretty much what the sketch comedy skits were like and even those weren't that funny.Just last week in my high school journalism class, learning about satire and parody, we watched numerous faux-commercials from SNL taken from as far back as the 1970's to the present. I, shockingly, found none of them funny and surprisingly desperate attempts at generating humor from what seemed like a child creating names to coincide with stupid products. I state that this because maybe it's not just that the excitement and interest of this concept involving two brothers who frequent nightclubs and embrace the party entirely alludes me but the excitement and interest of SNL alludes me. I couldn't tell you.Starring: Will Ferrell, Chris Kattan, Molly Shannon, Michael Clarke Duncan, Richard Grieco, and Loni Anderson. Directed by: John Fortenberry.",2,1,5,18 February 2014
The Purge," All the tension and thought-provoking discussion pieces are encapsulated in a film that can't support them
","The Purge exploits its home-invasion, pot-boiler suspense fully but leaves opportunities for exploration of political allegory — as hinted in the trailer — conveniently untouched. When you have a premise as good as this one, make it appear to house commentary about the political and social spectrum that is America today, and you opt for a carbon-copy thriller, that is something of a cinematic sin.The film sets up 2022 America, 'a nation reborn,' so they say, thanks to a social policy called 'The Purge.' 'The Purge' is a twelve hour event, one night a year, where all crime is legal and all emergency services are suspended. This gives people an outlet for all the violence, anger, and rage they keep up inside them and apparently brings crime to an all time low and contributes to a flourishing economy. We focus on a wealthy home security developed named James Sandin (Ethan Hawke) and his wife and two children as they prep for the annual Purge in their luxurious mansion, equipped with Sandin's fine security system. Shortly after the alert is given, James' son Charlie notices an injured man, appearing homeless, is running out on the streets screaming for help and assistance. Charlie disarms the system, allowing the man to come in, before James safely arms the system again.It isn't long before a group of Purge-preppers, lead by actor Rhys Wakefield, who is tremendous here, show up, demanding they let the 'homeless swine' out of the house so the gang can kill them and rid the streets of their kind. Failure to comply on the Sandins' part will result in their security system being dismantled and their lives taken from them through blunt-force. The masked-preppers cut the power and patiently wait while the Sandins' decide what to do.A slew of the film's details go unexplained. Why do the criminals need masks when it doesn't make a difference if they're discovered or not since the crime goes unpunished anyway? Also, how does the national crime rate go down to untold lows just because one night a year for twelve hours the population is granted total impunity? Does gang violence, drug warfare, and robberies cease to exist just because of this? If James' security system is so damn fool-proof why doesn't it have a child safety lock so little impulsive children don't put their entire family at risk by setting off the alarm? Why do the preppers themselves camp outside and wait for one homeless man to come out of the house when they're wasting precious hours ridding the streets of more invaluable swine? And what brain-dead congressman/government official decided the brilliant way to cut down on national crime would be to implement something as unlawful, dangerous, and as stupefyingly hazardous to the peace as 'The Purge' anyway? It's frustrating to see such a potential-ridden opportunity stoop down to nothing but an outlet, or a fix, for dime-store entertainment. It takes about thirty or forty minutes to realize that 'The Purge' doesn't care about establishing conversation or invoking originality through its clever premise; all it wants is to have its audience members watch a dreary home-invasion, survivalist thriller that squanders potential faster than you can enable James' security system.The ending all comes down to a relentless brawl between good, moral souls vs. bad, amoral souls in which the sequences of brutality are almost entirely incomprehensible thanks to poor lighting and choppy editing. The film becomes utterly relentless, not in terms of violence, but in terms of style, which is to obscure everyone and everything so much that the only thing audible enough to be distinguished is a shotgun blast. I would've rather been able to read 'The Purge' as a political statement on the violence of humanity and mankind, or even a social critique about our 'inherently violent' nature and further justification on why 'The Purge' is a good idea after all. I expected too much from a mainstream film by the notorious company Platinum Dunes.Everyone who acts here is adequate, with the exception of Rhys Wakefield who is simply brilliant, and the tension at the beginning of the film is some of the best of this year. But all of it is encapsulated in a film that simply doesn't have the depth or element of surprise to contain it all efficiently. One of my jobs as a film critic is to give audiences other films to seek out if the film in question isn't too great and my substitute recommendation is 'The Trigger Effect.' Like 'The Purge,' it's a film that questions your ethics and your behavior in times of sheer camaraderie and blunt uncertainty, but it also delivers more on the levels of character and tension, along with becoming more than a home-invasion thriller as 'The Purge' falls prey to. It's your choice on how you want to spend your evening. If you're looking for a topical discussion on the idea of allowing citizens to run lawless in the streets for twelve-hours a year, than you have all your talking points by watching the two and a half minute trailer.",4,3,7,7 June 2013
Pitch Perfect," *Insert 'Aca' pun here*
","I went into Pitch Perfect expecting a very different film. After seeing so many lame, easy-going, fluffy tween pictures that do little to drum up anything but the awareness of the clichés they are heavily relying on, this film is a breath of clean, lively, and somewhat subversive fresh air as it shows a group of collegians in their school's a capella program trying to make it to a prestigious competition and hopefully change the face of the entire a capella world. It's also pretty apparent here that a capella beats all extra circular activities at this college, including football. And even academics.I approached Pitch Perfect with the same hesitation I did Mean Girls, which I went on to dub one of the smartest, most relatable teen movies of the last decade. I feared that Pitch Perfect would become obsessed with the idea of cheekiness, rapidly descending into the bowels of self parody, with jokes that screamed childish and characters that defined caricature. The film is rather cheeky and self-aware, but it presents itself in a light-hearted way, completely knowing its origins, and while respecting them, simultaneously not taking them too seriously, creating warmth and vibrant atmosphere for the film's entire runtime. It understands the inanity of its idea, yet can still conduct itself seriously when needed and jokingly when applicable.The story concerns the fine arts-driven school Barden University, where incoming freshman Beca (the lovely Anna Kendrick) enters with something a little less than a hungry, open mind. Her tuition is free, thanks to her professor father, but she envisions herself in Los Angeles, enjoying the warm sun and pursuing a niche career in music producing. Her father fears that her field is too specific and it's more of a hobby than a formal career (don't get me started on my aspirations, which I'm learning fall along the same lines). Yet we know she's serious; just look at all the hip beats and uniquely composed instrumentals on her laptop, one of which replicating and sampling the fantastic ballad 'I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)' by The Proclaimers.After seeing her miserable and uninspired after a month of school, Beca's father strikes an abrupt and unusual deal with her; if she can find a club and show genuine passion for it, she can go to Los Angeles and he will help her with her dream of being a producer. She decides to join the Barton Bellas, an a capella team at the college, that made headlines (or blurbs, depending on how seriously a newspaper handles a capella news) after an embarrassing incident at the International Championship of Collegiate A Capella. The Bellas are looking to rebound their reputation of being a joke, and hire Beca as a new member despite her notably quirky, 'alternative' personality.The leader of the Bellas, a dictating woman named Aubrey (Anna Camp), keeps the group on a very tight schedule that is anything but mailable. She prohibits talking to or 'penetrating' members of 'The Treblemakers,' currently the number one a capella group at Bardon University. Unfortunately, Beca has become somewhat entangled with Jesse (Skylar Astin), a charming movie-geek who has fun bringing energy and joy to the students of Bardon. Jesse also takes pride in introducing Beca to the limitless wonders of film scores, telling her that John Hughes' The Breakfast Club has one of the best movie endings of all time. I couldn't agree more. And on a final note, all the a capella tournaments are announced by Elizabeth Banks (who too serves as one of the several producers on this film) and John Michael Higgins, who assume a witty and often charming 'Statler and Waldorf'-like personality during the competitions and clearly have fun reciting the material, which comes off as practically improvised. For all I know, it was.One of the many charmingly realistic things about Pitch Perfect is it steers clear of the typical teen romance trap, and collectively subverts them by staying focused on the misfit Bellas and the competition at hand, rather than the relationships they may go on to form. Consistent readers know how I tire from the incredibly senseless humor that, thanks to attention span-shortening shows like iCarly and Victorious (and if we're talking film, the pathetic Diary of a Wimpy Kid franchise), has now become increasingly common. This was a more mature film than I expected to see, with a stable commentary on the quirks of life and the beauty of being different. Even the film stays away from lackluster character stereotypes, making The Treblemakers pompous and self-consumed, yet truly showing that they have talent and possess serious singing skills.During more than one of the numbers, I questioned how, um, authentic some of this singing was. Sometimes, we can tell that the beautiful Anna Kendrick (who spent much of her teenage years on Broadway) is singing songs like David Guetta's 'Titanium' and see that The Treblemakers are perfectly recreating a beat-less version of Flo Rida's 'Right Round,' but at other times we can see that some of the sounds are rather unnatural. Let me just say that the vocals occasionally sound widely overproduced and some of the musical sounds mirror those of synthesizers.Yet this isn't enough of a problem to distract the viewer greatly. Director Jason Moore makes smart decisions about keeping the direction fast-paced, and screenwriter Kay Cannon is aware of the female adolescent culture and can near perfectly replicate it. Not every decision is a surefire hit, seeing as there are far too many jokes about projectile vomit (two instances of it) and one random and unnecessary scene that takes place shortly after the second instance. Regardless, it can be noted that Pitch Perfect is one of the most impressive and complete tween efforts of the year, showing little immaturity, but a grand amount of understanding of the increasingly complex teenage demographic.",8,2,6,20 December 2012
A Nightmare on Elm Street," One of the undisputed godfathers of the slasher film genre
","Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street has become a quintessential genre classic; when people reference the 'good ol' days' of horror or the slasher film, they generally have both Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street in mind. Not much can be said about the classic film that hasn't already been said before, aside from the fact that this remains one of the most fundamental genre films of its time and its impact as a film is still widely felt today like the waves of an aftershock. It's one of those horror films that you don't need to put in context of the times because it's so legitimately good and scary that it scares you anyway.We open in the midst of Nancy Thompson's (Heather Langenkamp) nightmare, where she is haunted by a figure wearing a red and green striped sweater, a fedora hat, and a hand made up of razors. She wakes up shell-shocked and informs her friends Tina (Amanda Wyss), Rod (Nick Corri), and Glen (Johnny Depp) about the nightmare, to which nobody but Tina seems immediately convinced, for she had a similar nightmare that same night. After a while, the gang brushes it off in favor of a sleepover at Tina's house, which ends in tragedy as Tina is brutally murdered in her sleep upon elevating from her bed and being viciously attacked by an unseen force. Because Rod, her boyfriend, slept with her that night, he is taken into custody and Nancy and Glen are left to confront what exactly is haunting them and how to stop it.The actual haunting comes from a demon named Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund), a savage character that seems to be extracted from the bowels of your most sinister nightmare. His methods are dastardly original, for he haunts victims in their dreams and daydreams, before murdering them in their sleep, where they'll subsequently die in real life, as well. Wes Craven, who also wrote the film, makes Freddy so quietly ingenuous you might miss the reason why he's such an unexpected villain. Sleeping is when we, as humans, are at our most vulnerable, taken out of our environment temporarily in favor of a night's refreshment to 'recharge our batteries,' so to speak colloquially, for the next day. With that, we cannot consciously control what and who we dream of, so Freddy shows up in our dreams in order to snatch us at our most vulnerable and make us not see another day. We can't defend ourselves, nor can we adequately predict what will happen.While Jason Voorhees, who predated Freddy a good four years to the point where he was already finding a new batch of impressionable youth to kill for the fourth time before his genre-counterpart decided to show up, could attack youth when their hormones and sexual energy were at its peak, Freddy attacked his victims during a time when they should've felt safety. With that, Craven emphasizes this realm of the dream-world by merging the likes of reality and dreams together, successfully blurring the line not only to confuse the characters in the film, but us, as well.None of this would be possible if the cast weren't as strong as they were, and save for some cheesiness in line delivery, most of the cast is strong here, particularly Langenkamp, who I would've loved to see take on varying roles aside from just horror films. The film also features the first on-screen performance by Johnny Depp, who gives one of his only human, everyman roles here in the face of grave danger.A Nightmare on Elm Street is often buoyed by a wonderful sense of suspense on part of Craven and cinematographer Jacques Haitkin, who do a fine job at not only blurring lines of reality, but creating a film that essentially bleeds creepiness, figuratively and literally. This is a downright spooky film, giving off the vibes of a demented haunted house, where at any moment a character will slip into an unforeseeable abyss and be scarfed up by demons like a piece of meat fed to hungry, feral savages. It's a film that manages to be occasionally gruesome without every being artistically empty or even an ugly piece of film; it's constantly enjoyable and a strong film in terms of its narrative structure.The only trouble, seeing past the cloud of nostalgia that often cloaks this film, is that the slowburn technique that Craven clearly tries to employ here sort of interrupts itself early in the second act, where we see a bit too much of Freddy, to the point where Nancy decides to engage in a fight with him. This feels like a case of 'climax come lately,' where what could pragmatically be the conclusion to the film comes far earlier than expected and is instead used as a vehicle for the plot halfway through. Craven would've done better to keep Freddy a more abstract figure up until the end, focusing on his trademarks before revealing the final, hair-raising product. The scene where Freddy and Nancy face off in a dream feels like it happens far too soon and throws off Craven's methodical buildup.A Nightmare on Elm Street, through whatever flaw I try to accuse it of having, is still an indisputable masterpiece of the genre, destined to live on no matter how many sequels, remakes, reboots, or licensed products leach off of it. Much like The Hills Have Eyes, Craven's earlier work, this is a film that does a wonderful job at personifying fear, although while the former film gave us a taste of personified fear in an unfamiliar location, this particular film gives us a taste of unbridled fear at our most vulnerable. Sleep tight.Starring: Heather Langenkamp, Robert Englund, Johnny Depp, Nick Corri, and Amanda Wyss. Directed by: Wes Craven.",8,3,4,13 October 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," The hunger for stronger material lives on
","I'll be the first soul to admit the wait between the first Hunger Games films and its sequel wasn't a particularly grueling one, and I likely could've went another year without even giving much thought to the characters or the setup. The first cinematic installment was plagued by questionably unsteady direction, clearly diluted political and social commentaries, violence with little impact, sterilized emotion, and a female hero who appeared more as an archetype or a character on a pro-women propaganda poster rather than a character with practical motivations and a believable persona to her.I reassured myself that this kind of material could resonate with me heavily after watching Kinji Fukasaku's tremendous Battle Royale, a film that still stirs up controversy and one that finds its way in conversations about its similar contemporary The Hunger Games. But I'm beginning to learn that with film, and life, no expectations equate to no disappointments. Catching Fire is a modest affair, with occasional highpoints exploring the politics of a land's government and its inherently corrupt system, but is too often burdened by hokey instances of humor, eye-rolling dialog and emotional sequences, and dreary survivalist sequences that have the feel of a video game.We are reacquainted with Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), last year's winners of the legendary 'Hunger Games' along with her close-friend and sometimes-boyfriend Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson). At the beginning, Katniss is scolded by President Snow (Donald Sutherland) for her actions in the games because now, numerous districts are rebelling and civil unrest is prominent within much of the Panem community. Katniss and Peeta now embark on a district-wide tour, giving a speech about their victory and such, while trying to prepare for the next 'Hunger Games' when everything seems to be in disarray. Katniss seems to be roadblocked by a love triangle with Peeta and Gabe (Liam Hemsworth), a strict government, and the thought that the world of Panem is on the verge of an implosion.The first half of Catching Fire is surprisingly strong with its examination of a narrow-minded government and further exploration into their devious actions. I was kind of shocked as to how much I was intrigued by the setups, as the first one scarcely captivated me. Writers Simon Beaufoy and Michael Arndt make the exploration more rooted in politics and social commentary, showing the consequences of Katniss and Peeta winning the last 'Hunger Games' and the luxuries that come along with it. It would also be cruel to say that the series' new director Francis Lawrence doesn't come in at a critical time for the series as well. The second film is usually where the stakes become higher, the conflicts become deeper, and the characters become more fleshed-out and this challenge is one he handles very well. He also knows how to direct very spacious, complex landscapes such as the open wilderness and a massive Colosseum; something the original film's director Gary Ross struggled with, as much of his camera-work was shaky and unnecessarily unsteady.However, after about an hour of solid insight into the government of Panem, the film follows the relatively bland and tiring method of its predecessor by making its 'Hunger Games' focus of the film nothing more than a survivalist video game of sorts. When it is discovered how exactly the chaos ensues and when certain forces will be summoned to attack, it reminded me keenly of how my friends and I use to play outside when we were children using our imagination that we were being chased by creatures of all kinds. I bring this up because the method Catching Fire uses to include these asinine features feels like the improvisational tactics my friends and I used as children. Now, it's a tactic I simply don't care for. It feels like run-of-the-mill fantasy filmmaking where things just happen and questioning them means you have far too much time on your hands.I suppose, however, I could deal with the film's frantic inclusion of various forces of nature compared to the onslaught of instances in this film that either don't belong or fall flat in their goal. Consider the scene when former 'Hunger Games' victor Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), Katniss, and Peeta are all in an elevator and a woman comes in to request her dress be unzipped just so she can stand naked in front of the three to be the apple of Haymitch and Peeta's eye. Or how about the scene when an accident is almost fatal and Peeta and Katniss need to relish their existence once more by holding each other and crying in the wilderness. The scene falls completely flat because, believe it or not, Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson don't seem to have the emotional aspect of their acting down. Many of their movements are shockingly cold or just have the inability to provoke sympathy. And let's not forget all of this is captured within the boundaries of a young adult novel.It's a no-brainer that those who love the Suzanne Collins' trilogy and the original film will be among the first in line to see Catching Fire and propel the film to hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. This is a fact that cannot be challenged. After two of these films, both of which pretty similar except for the second time around things got off on a better foot for at least a brief time, I truly don't relish the thought of venturing out to see the series' conclusion twice in theaters. There's one more thing I can say positively about the film and that it's infinitely superior to the recently-released parody film of the series The Starving Games and, the more I think about it, the more I'd gladly venture out twice more to watch the series conclude than have to sit through five minutes of that film again.",6,32,71,23 November 2013
Godzilla," An exercise in rousing action and style
","Gareth Edwards' Godzilla is the only Godzilla film I have ever seen, leaving me nothing to compare this new adaptation to whatsoever. My knowledge of Godzilla movies is similar to my knowledge on the Rocky sequels, none of which I've seen; I can tell you a number of the villains and some of the plot-points but nothing so much as a description as to why each film deserves to exist. What I can say is that the latest installment in the hulking monster's filmography is a marginally successful spectacle of special effects and impending doom, featuring a great array of strong actors and slowburn action.The story opens in Japan by showing two egg-shaped objects, one of which hatched and subsequently entering the sea. Nearby, a nuclear plant starts experiencing rapidly growing seismic activity, with the nuclear plant's supervisor Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) running out of options as the plant eventually works its way into an all-out nuclear meltdown. In the midst of the meltdown, Joe's wife Sandra (Juliette Binoche) dies inside, and the entire area surrounding the nuclear plant is quarantined and labeled uninhabitable.Fifteen years later, we acquaint with Joe's older son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), who is an explosive ordinance disposal officer in the Navy, living with his wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) and kid. Ford and Joe reconnect in Japan, where Joe is hellbent on trying to label what caused the earthquake and the nuclear meltdown of Japan. As we know, there can only be one real explanation and that's the presence of a gigantic, lizard monstrosity by the name of Godzilla.For starters, as a non-Godzilla fan, there is a thought that has been racing through my mind for quite sometime. Traditionally, Godzilla films were characterized by their low budget special effects, cheesy acting, and sometimes hilariously bad plot-points. Isn't cleaning it up to fit the standards of the populous defeating the purpose? Isn't making the film exist on a larger, more polished scale, where action and special effects are all backed up by hundreds of millions of dollars kind of against the film's original blueprints? That's not saying that Godzilla immediately fails, but perhaps it's just the shock of seeing once cheap, rather unremarkable material in terms of aesthetic and look all of a sudden get the extremely expensive upgrade.Nonetheless, the film makes sure to at least have us spend some time with the human characters of the picture before Godzilla is even brought into the picture. We see ample amounts of Cranston and Taylor-Johnson - who gives Godzilla a run for his money in terms of how much screen time he is given - and writer Max Borenstein eases his way into introducing the monster. He may ease a bit too much, in fact, seeing as when we do get to see Godzilla, it's still in glimpses fit for teaser trailers rather than the actual, feature-length product. While Borenstein pleasantly avoids overexposure of his titular character, he manages to keep him a tad too humble and limited, preventing larger, more thought-provoking ideas concerning the character to come through.Aside from the slowburn writing, Gareth Edwards' direction is easy to praise for one particular reason - he keeps things clear and easy to follow in terms of action. Given Godzilla's size and ability, the film could've been a nonstop parade of special effects that captured nothing but the cold tendencies of action filmmaking. Edwards keeps things alive and stylistic, infusing long-shots and large-scale shots that encompass all the action, rather than extreme close-ups that do nothing other than confuse and disorient when edited together.Godzilla also gets additional points for not immediately feeling like a project that exists for the sole purpose of setting up a sequel or a franchise. Films like The Amazing Spider-Man and Prometheus seem to have a difficult time living in the now and dealing with the present, and instead attempt to setup story lines and characters they're not even sure are going to materialize and how. Godzilla manages to stay fixated on the current issues facing its characters rather than looking to set up its third and fourth sequel on its first run.The film will likely appeal to the masses as a piece of rousing action and style; I have no idea what hardened Godzilla fans will make of it. There's fun to be had in the form of style and slowburn drama, for one, and the excitement that comes from seeing Godzilla is something to marvel. As I stated, I was hoping for something to have a bit more fun with itself and utilize a more basic aesthetic. Despite being the grandfather of all monsters, there seems to be something rather interchangeable here. I fear that Godzilla is on track to getting the treatment many superheros, beloved movie characters, and cartoon icons are already getting which is ubiquitous marketing and conventional setups in mainstream motion pictures.Starring: Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Bryan Cranston, Elizabeth Olsen, Ken Watanabe, Juliette Binoche, Sally Hawkins, and David Strathairn.

Looper," How would you market this career at a job-fair?
","Rian Johnson's Looper is an intriguing science-fiction film, with a devotion to story and plot that is larger than competitors of its genre within recent years. It elaborates where other films would cop-out and purposely mystify. However, like great science-fiction, it requires significant attention to its patterns, detail, and design - something I underestimated prior to viewing.For that reason alone, perhaps Looper warrants another viewing on my part, just as a refesher. Constant evaluation seems worthless, as it so often does, an a crash course-research job seems oversimplifying. I sort of just want to experience the film again on its own terms before jumping random and arbitrary theories.I'll keep the story relatively basic; we are now in 2044 (the present), where Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) works as a 'looper.' A 'looper' is responsible for whacking the criminals mob members send from the future, 2074. Joe will wait in an empty field when a man, masked and on his knees, will spawn in thin air like a video game character before shooting the man with a loud, ear-shattering blunderbuss. He'll proceed to dispose of the corpse in a furnace. This whole process exists because, we're told, it's much harder to dispose of a corpse in 2074 America. Apparently, it's much easier to conceal and operate a time-traveling machine (which is illegal, mind you).A looper, inevitably, meet their fate when the mob members eventually spawn their own self thirty years into the future. This is known as 'closing the loop,' and is feared and unexpected in the career of loopers. Joe finally meets his older self (Bruce Willis), who he recognizes since he lacks the obligatory 'mask over face' deal, and proceeds to have coffee with him in a diner and a long discussion before discovering his intentions. Later in the film, he meets Sara (Emily Blunt) and her younger brother Cid (Pierce Gagnon), two locals living on a farm that wind up getting mixed up in Joe's predicament.A small feature that seems to have gone unnoticed by the public is the terrific makeup job conducted by a team of over twenty specialists who deserve more work in the field. The goal is to make Gordon-Levitt resemble a younger, spryer Bruce Willis, and the result is surprisingly great. Imperfections, however, such as more makeup on the character than in previous scenes, have been dually noted, but posed no distractions for someone who sometimes feels underwhelmed by scenery and makeup effects.Joseph Gordon-Levitt does some powerful work here, further establishing that he long ago assumed the impact and power as a character actor. From sci-fi, to action, to comedy, to drama, etc, it would be an understatement to regard him as just an actor; he's one of the most diverse souls in Hollywood today. Emily Blunt is anything but typical here, assuming a role that allows her to be brash, strong, independent, and something of a role model. Another surprising feature about Looper is its treatment of supporting characters, not simply giving the little ground to walk on. Jeff Daniels is great as Abe, the main boss, and Paul Dano, another terrific character actor who just showed untold potential in For Ellen and Ruby Sparks is Seth, Joe's pal who is fearing the worst after he 'let his loop run' - meaning he failed to shoot the man after spawning.Like almost all science-fiction films, one can dissect them apart in such an unforgiving way that nothing would be left except for confusion and plot holes. I do not consider in-depth analysis to be a conventional part of my film criticisms, although I feel inclined to question aspects in a more collective manner. For instance, why can't the mob spawn the men directly into the furnace, omitting the danger and inevitable, 'self-inflicted' murder a looper must commit? Also, I reiterate the question of how hard can it be to dispose of a corpse in 2074, when time-travel equipment can be made seemingly easy to access for an already criminally-run sector of the population? Has the futuristic black market become something of an incalculable empire? Looper does have a tad more explaining to do, but to its credit, its world and concepts aren't as arbitrary or as impossible as they sound. I could suspend most disbelief, much to my surprise. The future it paints isn't so much as flashy as it is attractive, detailed, and practical - like a high-resolution, digital photograph brought to life. Its crisp visuals and slick photography make it all the more captivating to watch and enjoy. One small aesthetic I, too, neglected to mention is the sound. For a science-fiction film, I was stunned at how effective it was at using auditory levels and sound editing. The use of genuine, abrupt sound is perfect when incidents like the first shot of the blunderbuss occur, or when Cid activates his extreme telekinetic powers. The effect is jarring and bombastic in the most stimulating way.Johnson has proved himself to be a storyteller above anything with Looper as his attention and development to a world so close yet so foreign to our current one is an achievement. His writing scarcely falters and his talent as a director rarely does as well. Assisted by only competent talent and terrific uses of smaller aesthetics, Looper is a well-done science fiction endeavor that finally caters to a more demanding, unfairly rewarded demographic. I'd just love to see how the job of a looper would be marketed at a town job-fair.Starring: Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis, Emily Blunt, Pierce Gagnon, Paul Dano, and Jeff Daniels.

Casino," No Gamble Needed, Casino Wins the Bet of Favorite Scorsese Picture
","Every scene, a thrill. Every shot, a beauty. Every line, a breath-taker. Scorsese's films are masterpieces and Casino is too. I've called Casino a masterpiece since I was seven hard to believe because I saw about half of it when I was younger and loved the look and feel of it all. Now seeing the whole thing again seven years later I love it and call it my favorite Scorsese film. A lot of people choose Goodfellas over this, but Im the opposite, I think Goodfellas was a great mobster movie and a real life look at the 50s Mafia, but I just love Casino for everything it is.The three main actors De Niro, Pesci, and Stone have all outdone themselves here. This is the best work for all three of them individually. They play their roles with power and serve a unique purpose. Without De Niro, the narrations wouldn't have the same effect and be less powerful. Without Pesci, there would be no Italian to swear as good as him. He swears with meaning and makes you fear him when he steps on screen. His cutthroat, no BS attitude is what stands out on screen. Just like the quote said by Robert Di Nero.Having heard that I repeated it to myself numerous times to get the full effect. It was one of the most powerful quotes in movie history to me. Last, but far from least, is Sharron Stone's portrayal of Ginger McKenna Rothstein. She takes the role in full effect by strutting her gorgeous self in front of the camera with every shot of her being a slick one. Her attitude the whole movie really sticks with you and the fights her and De Niro have are very shocking, yet powerful at the same time. Its a feeling, I've only got from this film.The plot is true and is about Sam 'Aces' Rothstein (De Niro) working as a bookie at the Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. He takes his job beyond seriously and is usually caught in the minx of everything. His goal is to double Casino profits which is then skimmed by the Mafia which is then reported to the tax agencies. Whatever he bets on, he wins, thats that. He has never made a bet he wasn't sure he was going to win. Hes a smart guy and has never done a bet wrong. He is constantly bothered and put at risk when his buddy Nicky Santoro (Pesci, character based on the real life Anthony Spilotro) is sent to Vegas to assist Same, but winds up antagonizing all the casino members and his brash language and overall personality gets his name in a Black Book which lead to him banned from every casino in Vegas.Sam falls for the hooker and hustler Ginger McKenna (Stone) who he winds up having a child with and marrying. He gives Ginger his trust and puts her jewelry, and $2,000,000 cash money in a bank in which she can only access. Sam regrets it deeply when Ginger is still sneaking around with her ex con boyfriend Lester Diamond (James Woods). Their marriage soon crumbles, leading her to a strict and pervasive drug addiction with only Nicky to to.I don't want to go in full detail because the movie does have various surprises including the end, which I saw when I was seven and has traumatized me since. Seeing it again didn't have the same effect, but still scared me for life. This time, I cant say it's just a movie. This honestly happened. The events in this movie really happened and thanks to Scorsese is taken in a serious approach with characters that are in depth and to the point. Nobody but Scorsese could have done this movie. It is a true beauty and shouldn't be taken for granted.I play poker with my friend Mike using fake chips and having no real money involved. It something we do to pass the time. After seeing this movie it almost makes me not want to touch a card or chip again. Sure just playing slots, poker, Blackjack, Roulette, or any poker game wont put you in the position of Nicky, but it makes you think how much hot water these guys really sunk in. This is a job that depends on life or death and is not something I'd ever think to do. Money is one thing, risk is another.The movie is often shown on networks like Bravo and much of it has to be cut out because the f word is said exactly 422 times in three hours. Also because of the drugs and violence about thirty minutes is trimmed out too. My opinion is if this isn't shown in the raw, it shouldn't be shown at all. Profanity is common in this movie, but it shows you how strict Italians got. Various racial terms toward Muslims and Jewish people were brought up. Without the feeling or tense and frustration inside these people the movie is bland. It needs to have profanity to be true to the story of mobsters and gamblers. As well as the violence. Its jam packed with violence, but it needs to be there to show the full aspect. Without it, its tame and false.Casino is a genuine film that maybe overshadowed by Goodfellas and Raging Bull, but to me it's a one of a kind, gambling masterpiece with a four star cast, a four star plot, and a four star feeling after watching it. It has the rare effect of after watching it you feel like you lived it. A true masterpiece in the film industry and Scorsese's best film.Starring: Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Sharron Stone, James Woods,, Frank Vincent, Don Rickles, and Alan King.

Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Another experience I delayed far, far too long
","George Lucas' Star Wars is a project unlike one I've seen before, as cliché and as empty as that statement might sound. It's a monumental achievement in the cinematic world, arguably the biggest one ever, that pioneered special effects work and accommodated for other science-fiction projects to follow in the next decades. When released in 1977, with sufficient hype and outstanding reviews, it was a movie-going experience; thousands of showings were sold out (something you never hear about anymore), universal audiences were captivated, cultists and enthusiasts were born, and the eye-popping technology was cherished and admired by many.Watching Star Wars today (now called Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope with the release of the three prequels), there is still a uniquely affecting vibe that it sends with its compelling visuals and wonderfully articulated characters. It's over thirty years old, but it effectively holds the torch that makes it timeless. No matter how far technology progresses, and even with the onset of computer-animation and a heavy reliance on digital cinema, the look and beauty of Star Wars will likely never die out.Since it appears that everyone has seen the Star Wars movies except for myself, I will spare you the boredom of hearing the plot reiterated for the umpteenth time. Besides, I'm not sure if I could explain it accurately. The film is fast-paced, dynamic, and just works so competently, that after a while, I began to dissolve any questions I had about the plot and just go along for the ride. Consistent readers know what I think of constant cinematic evaluations, and that I find them to often be without a reward and potentially lethal to the likability of a film. Things happen in Star Wars; crazy things, logical things, smart things, frightening things, but above all, enthralling things.Speaking of enthralling things, I must admit how often I felt tension build and suspense become prevalent during the course of this film. For one thing, it's blatantly obvious to people who haven't even seen the series that these characters will make it (hence the two sequels). Yet, during several sequences, I found myself tense and extremely worried for these characters (most notably the scene in the trash chute). When a film can make you fear when you know the outcome is when you know true filmmaking tactics are at hand.Something I have notice happen with older science-fiction films is that one of their downsides is their length due to their special effects showcase. Let me explain; Star Trek: The Motion Picture was a visual marvel when it first came out, but its story was extended out about twenty-five minutes longer than it needed to be because they were showcasing the technology, which was breathtaking at the time. It appears, too, that many fans even recall this fact with a bit of sourness, which is why when people refer to the 'original trilogy' of the Star Trek films, they usually mean the second film through the fourth one. Star Wars doesn't bear that same quality; it doesn't need to turn the story into a methodical plod just to show off its creative design and visuals. It doesn't feel like a showcase. We get a perfect feel for the environment without having to stare at for an upwards of five minutes.One thing that disheartens me greatly about this series is how controversial it has become. With numerous releases on DVD, and a new one on Blu-Ray, to my knowledge, the only original cuts of the Star Wars films you can see are on the Laserdisc/VHS versions. Because of this, fans have found themselves lambasting decisions made by Lucas, criticizing all the changes he has made to the series on the new releases of the DVDs, his re-releases of the movies in theaters, and lucrative branding/licensing of the figures in the money that, in 2013, continue to flood the store aisles of a Wal-Mart and Toys-R-Us near you. I believe that's one of the contributing reasons to why I never saw or even felt like seeing the original films until now; I felt alienated and bullied, with the series seemingly shoving itself down my throat.On a final note, another impressive element is the charisma and talent of a young Mark Hamill, portraying no one else but Luke Skywalker. Hamill seems like the kind of guy who, after breaking out in Lucas' trilogy of films, would have gone on to do unprecedented projects, but alas, no. Hamill has only acted in either small roles or cameos in films, and hasn't really worked on any other mainstream picture aside from the Star Wars trilogy. While this fact is slightly depressing, as one can only imagine what he could've done, it's fortunate we weren't burdened of seeing him in anything atrocious.Star Wars is, in short, an incorruptible masterpiece on film. A film that launched the genre of science fiction, propelling films about outer space to unheard of heights. It's just incredibly unfortunate to see what dismal treatment it, and its fans, have had to endure since its release.Starring: Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford. Directed by: George Lucas.",10,5,7,23 March 2013
Footloose," Cut Footloose (once again)
","The only real reason to pay any attention at all to the new Footloose is to watch the music video for the terrific Big and Rich song 'Fake ID.' Other than that, there is little appeal in the film, as it shamelessly recycles almost every scene, event, and line from its original counterpart, and the ones it doesn't, it modifies for an audience that is questionably existent. If there's anything the film made me do, it made me seriously contemplate what a 'remake' actually is and what their inherent goal is. To make the original material better? Make the story more current? Give it a stronger, more contemporary feel and look? If those questions were considered during the making of the Footloose remake, they weren't considered for very long. This is a stale, unimaginably boring picture, with its first real problem being it is trying to make an immensely dated story of music and dancing banishment current and relatable to teenagers of the present. In a time where vulgar rap by artists named 'Chief Keef,' 'Juicy J,' and 'Wiz Khalifa' can be found on the iPods of teens in schools and they can get away with it, I highly doubt teens will be able to resonate with playing Kenny Loggins or Quiet Riot a bit too loud.The original Footloose at least had the benefit of being a film with a contemporary issue to its time and the appeal of its lead, Kevin Bacon. Granted watching it now is like dusting off a C-grade vinyl that barely functions, it at least had the ability to give the student body a voice and a personality as they tried to keep their freedom to play rock music (please say this out loud) alive and well. The new Footloose, however, is like that guy randomly wearing acid-washed jeans in public in 2013; random, out of place, and questionable beyond belief.The story hasn't changed at all; we center our sites on the small town of Bomont, Georgia, that has been musically silenced since reverend Shaw Moore (Dennis Quaid) pressured the city council to ban music and dancing after loud music 'resulted' in the deaths of five teenagers driving late at night. I say 'resulted' because the cause of death was more of teenage stupidity. The pop music blaring on the radio at the time had little effect.Ten years after this horrendous legislation, Bostonian teenager Ren McCormack (Kenny Wormald) waltzes into town and experiences a culture shock when he realizes that, hey, not only do people who live in other towns have different lifestyles than himself, but music is frowned upon in this tight-nit community. However, that doesn't stop Moore's rebellious daughter Ariel (Julianne Hough), who can often be found batting her bubbly blue eyes and shaking her bouncy backside in no mans land areas deep in the outskirts of town along with dozens of other teens.Right off the bat, Moore isn't fond of the way Ren behaves. His attitude is smarmy and purposefully instigating, and the thought that he is a teen with something to say unnerves him greatly. The remainder of the film amplifies this conflict between them, as well as trying to make a bold statement that teenagers are supposed to be reckless, dumb, and the driving force behind many mistakes.This conflict between Ren and 'the man' leads all the way to the city council, where Ren tries to use Bible verses to sway the entire council (including Moore) to allow music and public dancing to be etched back in Bomont's society. He states that people in biblical times danced for God and Jesus, leaping and ecstatically celebrating them with the art of movement. Okay. I'm sure when Ariel is gyrating and shaking her blue-jean short-shorts in front of every guy in a vacant field she definitely has our lord and savior in mind. Same with Ren; I'm sure when he got down in the crowded saloon for line dancing or when him and several others fight the gang of bullies during a school dance at the end of the film, they all had God and Jesus in their hearts and minds. You couldn't fool a maroon with your logic.Director Craig Brewer (Black Snake Moan and Hustle and Flow - two films that wouldn't even be on the same shelf as Footloose in ANY category, list, arrangement, etc) doesn't even offer any pleasing attributes to this film stylistically, albeit some good choreography. Other than maybe a few good scenes involving a large production number and several dozen dancers, the film's redone music, contemporary atmosphere, updated production, and caricature-driven cast seems like an act of indolence, if anything. I had a hard time admiring the original Footloose, but credited it for being something of a time-staple, even if it doesn't hold up well in present time. It's hard to credit the new Footloose at all, since its very existence is perplexing.Starring: Kenny Wormald, Julianne Hough, Andie MacDowell, and Dennis Quaid.

50_50," Comedic, inspiring, dramatic, tearful, and effervescent
","After playing a bad boy rocker with a full head of hair, Joseph Gordon-Levitt now plays a nervous Cancer-patient with no hair at all. 50/50 is loosely based on the story of Will Reiser, who wrote this film, and is telling us his story and struggle through the character Adam.Adam is played by Levitt, a marvelous actor who is continuing his string of quirky, yet well made independent films where he plays an off-the-wall protagonist. Adam is twenty-seven and works for a Seattle radio company. He is informed that he has a rare form of Cancer called Neurofibrosarcoma, and is told he only has a 50% chance of living with it. Frustrated, but moving day by day in a seemingly calm manner with his buddy Kyle (Rogen), Adam continues his long journey only to be bothered by his annoying, self-centered girlfriend (Howard) frequently. Through thick and thin, Adam starts to cope with his disease and manages to stay calm for most of the picture.We all have to die at one point. It's part of the life. But I can't imagine the sadness and calamity brought upon someone who finds out they have a rare form of Cancer and that their chances of living are fifty-fifty. At twenty-seven nonetheless. My mother, who has work in a Chemotherapy unit for about a decade, said that the youngest she has even seen someone die from Cancer is two and a half years old. Some people, hardly get to experience life at firsthand because of Cancer.There are so many forms of Cancer, rare and common, harmless and not, that your chances of getting it are very high. Getting it is at random, but coping with it is even harder. While 50/50 has a heartbreaking, and is sometimes emotion-testing and tear-jerking, it still has a strong comedic relief thanks to Seth Rogen, who is rather unfairly bashed in a majority of his films.The acting is superb by both leads, the parents of Adam played by Angelica Houston and Serge Houde are portrayed effectively and in a loving way, and the screenplay and Johnathan Levine's direction never fails or works against this film in any way. Three years prior he was creating good chemistry between Ben Kingsley and Josh Peck in The Wackness. Now, he's finally mastered in creating two characters that do nothing but sparkle when on screen together. You can't really call this a Seth Rogen film because while his comedy is here, his underlying sweetness shows through the cloth of this film more than it has ever done before. The last time he gave a performance this well done was in Sandler's Funny People.Thanks to a wonderful third act in terms of direction and screenplay, you get an all out emotional breakdown from the characters and yourself. 50/50 has a way with making emotional moments not seemed contrived, but welcomed. I think out of everyone in the theater, my mom was more emotional than the average person in the general public which is understandable.Many films have come out this year, and many have been ignored. Comedies and dramas alike have been swept under the bus with other blockbusters in theaters at the same time. I plan on doing a list of the top ignored and underrated films of 2011. I hope 50/50 doesn't make that list.Starring: Joesph Gordon-Levitt, Seth Rogen, Bryce Dallas-Howard, Angelica Houston, and Serge Houde. Directed by: Johnathan Levine.",9,72,93,1 October 2011
Deadpool," Demands your money and rewards your obedience with a nearly two hour cacophony of violence, language, and debauchery
","Even if you downright despise Tim Miller's 'Deadpool,' Marvel's R-rated, vulgar and violent superhero film, you almost have to admire the lengths to which this film was marketed. 'Deadpool''s colorful and eclectic marketing campaigns, which featured interactive theater standees, a multitude of different posters and banners with tongue-in-cheek lines, bold and self- referential Television spots, professional interviews with the cast in character, and a release over Valentine's Day weekend to further its lack of boundaries, is among one of the best of the new decade in terms of getting people excited about what was predicted by many to be a tough film to market.The fact of the matter is something like 'Deadpool' is what the Marvel brand needs. Even amongst superhero fans, the recent influx and market-saturation of heroes getting their first origins story on film or sequels furthering another hero's saga, the genre is breeding familiarity and contempt at the same time (I've spoken about this on a personal level many times). Superhero films often bear a PG-13 rating for strong violence, sporadic language, and sexual innuendos. Meanwhile, here's a film of the genre that earns its R-rating like most Judd Apatow comedies do; comparatively, with all the four-letter words tossed around like sentence articles, it would the events on Saturday night at a city bar look worthy of a PG-13 rating. Finally, its bloody, often wince-inducing violence reminds us that, even in the modern day, superhero films aren't nearly as rough and ugly as they could be. The film is less Marvel's red-headed step- child amongst superheroes than it is an unearthly, oversized meteor that has just crashlanded in a multiplex near you, demanding your money and attention for nearly two hours in return for some of the most cacophonous violence, language, and debauchery you're likely to see from a mainstream film all year.The film revolves around Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds), a mercenary who now spends his days in New York City protecting teenage girls from stalkers and ex-boyfriends by working for a company that specializes in taunting and assaulting them. Wade winds up becoming romantically entangled with a prostitute named Vanessa Carlysle (Morena Baccarin) with plans to marry her until he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. As a response, he leaves Vanessa and undergoes an underground procedure to kill his cancer, only to be injected with a serum that leaves him horribly disfigured. Upon escaping from Francis Freeman's (Ed Skrein), the man who has surgically altered him and his body, Wade learns that he now has the ability to rapidly heal, as well as maneuver and contort his body in inhuman ways.In effort to mask his horrid appearance, Wade 'squeezes his ass' into red and black spandex, attaches two machetes to his back, protects himself with an endless supply of guns and ammo, and becomes the violent and unpredictable Deadpool. He plans on taking out Francis for ruining his physical appearance, rescue his girlfriend from her captivity by Francis, and continue to assure both Colossus (Stefan Kapičić) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead's (Brianna Hildebrand), two individuals that are part of X-Men, that he doesn't need to join X-Men in order to become a more competent, proved superhero.'Deadpool''s approach to humor is much like that of 'Dirty Grandpa''s, a film I saw about two weeks ago that has already faded from the minds of most consumers; it's a film that throws numerous lines, jokes, and concepts at a wall in order to see what sticks. Throughout the course of this film, Reynolds' Deadpool probably has a good one-hundred and fifty lines rooted in jokes, and while less than half produce a laugh, they help articulate that this is a character none of us have really seen before. Deadpool's unapologetic lack of political incorrectness is what makes him such a monumental, albeit exhausting, presence. His unwillingness to cater to the tendencies of the mainstream or the ordinary are precisely why we watch superhero films in the first place; it's only recently that we, along with the core themes of the films, have lost sight of this in favor of quantity over quality.The consistent pestering of Deadpool by Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead works to illustrate a nice metaphor of how Deadpool's inception on-screen came to be. Some studio executives probably wanted to neuter or clean up his attitude and story to make him a more marketable character rather than an outspoken anti- hero; perhaps make him a dark, but not too dark, X-Men character that at least had some semblance of discipline. Through Reynolds', Miller's, and screenwriters Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese's respect and loyalty to the character and his brand, they've created a film that will satisfy, or at least entertain, almost all who choose to see it. While its humor is a bit infrequent, its ability to entertain is quite prolific, merging meaningful drama with raunchy comedy and gratuitous bloodshed to create the Quentin Tarantino of superhero films from the ground up.Marvel needed a superhero that the wearying audience could look unto and smile and through the fourth-wall breaking, crude and careless, unapologetically ruthless Deadpool, they've crafted a hero that is worthy of your attention.",7,7,20,12 February 2016
Cloud Atlas," We know they're great actors, now they're going to really show it
","For years, it was said that David Mitchell's famous novel Cloud Atlas was 'unfilmable.' A story of such profound, epic-proportions that encapsulating all the beauty, charm, angst, heroism, and complexity of it would be an extraordinarily impossible feat. The Wachowski siblings, Andy and Lana, and Tom Tykwer have done it; they've successfully created a visionary tale of impeccable beauty. A polarizing epic filled with untold ambition and high-flying possibilities, for the most part, all of which extenuated with stunning beauty, Cloud Atlas manages to soar past any expectations to be one of the most puzzling and enjoyable pictures of the last decade.The film takes six drastically different story and manages to use mostly the same actors in each one of them, making them up to look like completely different people, playing different character-types, different races, and sometimes, different sexes. We all knew going into this that headliners Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugo Weaving, Hugh Grant, Jim Broadbent, and Susan Sarandon are immensely talented people, always capable of providing their audience with a memorable show, but I can imagine how challenged and pressured they felt to embody themselves in characters light years away from anything they've ever played before.I will explain the six stories ambiguously and quickly, so your experience may not be compromised. The first story, titled 'The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing,' takes place on an enormous ship sailing the Pacific, circa 1849, exploring relations between an optimistic crewmember and an African-American slave. The second story, 'Letters from Zedelghem,' is set in 1931 Belgium and dives into the complex relationship between a young music transcriber and the aging composer he must work for. The third, 'Half-Lives: The First Luisa Rey Mystery,' set in the 1970's, shows how a young journalist uncovers a huge nuclear conspiracy run by an oil company mogul. The fourth, 'The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish,' one of my favorites, centers on a British publisher who is trapped in an eccentric nursing home, shunned from his children and confined to the quirky treatment of the people working there. The fifth, 'An Orison of Sonmi~451,' shows a grim, plastic future, set in the 22nd century, where corporations have thrived at the expense of the population and clones have been made to run society, unless one of them can see the corruption and fight back (this is how that futuristic mess Branded should've been). Finally, the sixth story, 'Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After,' (by this time, we're around the year 2346) focuses on a tribesman and his close friendship with a woman with more technological aptitude than him and how their togetherness may be star-crossed or simply meant to be.Have I left you in the fog? After writing that, I feel I've greatly distanced myself from reality. Cloud Atlas is a film where one can go in with the mindset to completely absorb themselves in the movie, where they will never stop thinking, question everything, and extract multiple meanings from every little piece of it. Another could go in with the mindset to be entertained, but also treated with respect as a viewer, rewarded with their 164 minutes of patience by being given some deeper moral or life-realization. And finally, the most casual viewer can just walk in and expect a fine experience for which they will be marveled and left to cherish. No one is wrong here, but I do believe walking in with the mindset that you will question every little piece leaves little to no enjoyment on your behalf. I walked in with a willingness to pay attention, listen closely, and to be taken with the world the Wachowski's and Tykwer have brought to me, and not forget that I want to be entertained in the process. I wasn't let down in the slightest.My experience is greatly reminiscent of Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life (ironically, the 'Sloosha's Crossin'' story's cinematography looks very similar to the kind utilized in Malick's New World - about John Smith and Pocahontas). The first act was hard to get into, mainly because you're adapting to this world brought to you out of the blue. The second act is when you're beginning to like what you've been through and you're patiently awaiting more. The third act is when you've become so in touch with this world, that walking out of the multiplex is like leaving a place you feel you haven't spent enough time at. Let me just say, it was hard to go back in the car.That's as complicated as I'll go in trying to fathom the moral and the underlying theme(s) of Cloud Atlas. I feel continuing, painstaking research will cause nothing but frustration and exhaustion to the point of me never even wanting to look at the film again. And that is definitely not how a film like this should be treated. The film is one of the most lavish theater experiences I've come to have in my short years as a functioning internet critic, and between the incredible cinematography, subversive tonality, elegant performances, non-linear narrative, and the impact left on the viewer worth two or three epics, it'll be difficult to judge another dystopian film again. Now if only there was that emotional impact would Cloud Atlas have truly come full circle.Starring: Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Bae Doona, Ben Whishaw, James D'Arcy, Zhou Xun, Keith David, David Gyasi, Susan Sarandon, and Hugh Grant.

300," A carnage epic and that is all
","300's biggest strength is not its performances, nor its special effects, but its capable, crisp direction from Zack Snyder. Snyder's previous directing credits on the Dawn of the Dead remake couldn't have set him up for the large-scale directing performed on this kind of film, so perhaps his directing ways have inherently adapted to large, spacious locations.Unfortunately, with all the disposable action at hand, exhaustive yelling, and minimal depth, which can all be more noticeable to moviegoers than scenery and locations, Synder's talent may go unnoticed. I've been told that Frank Miller's original graphic novel is transferred smoothly to the film, in which case fans will most likely enjoy the film based on its loyalty to its source material. All I can say is I have no desire to read the series. 300is sort of similar to that loud, belligerent, and sloppy houseguest, yet due to his lack of self-awareness is oblivious to these facts and continues doing them, much to the dismay of his friends and colleagues.The plot concerns the infamous Battle of Thermopylae, which pitted Spartan king Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and his three hundred ill-equipped soldiers against King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) and his massive Persian army. We see Leonidas in training as a fearless Spartan as a young child, and after kicking a Persian messenger down a deep, endless well, begins an almighty war between the two sides.It's such a shame that writers Kurt Johnstad, Michael B. Gordon, and Snyder, respectively, dab more into battles and brutality on a grandiose-scale than the characters involved with such events. We spend so little time on Leonidas's motivations and development from a characterization perspective that he is nothing more than a faux-hero in this film; the one we side with because we're supposed to. The Xerxes character is the same way. His motivations and villainous behavior is depressingly shortchanged for excessively brutal, uninteresting carnage.300, in some cases, plays like the instant replay shots from an ancient epic, with slow motions shots of spears piercing skulls, digitized blood squirting off the characters, and swords crossing in the heat of the moment. Speaking of the heavy digitization in the film, what adds to the artificial aspect of the film is the graphic use of computer animation. Some sequences are sweeping shots of hundreds of armed men ('armed' meaning in low trousers, swords, and a shield for good measure) charging to another side of several more armed men. The effects instantaneously flashed me back to watching Wolfgang Petersen's Troy, and how, again, motivations and character complexity was traded for battles with hundreds of digitized warriors.Another film this reminded me of was Ridley Scott's Best Picture winner Gladiator, a film I was decidedly mixed on when I originally reviewed it and have grown to dislike more it over time. It had murky, muddy atmosphere and large landscapes of brown as far as the eye can see. Not to mention, we're already watching choppy, repetitive action sequences equivalent to a lengthy, drawn-out video game cut scene so perhaps the atmosphere is fitting.300 is a 'carnage epic,' an epic where bloody, slow motion fight scenes are more valuable than interesting characters and identifiable motivations. It's a cold, robotic film, with no thought in its empty head and no soul in its shockingly toned body. Every part of the characters' deep and inner-psyche is as artificial as the CGI on their bodies.Starring: Gerard Butler, Lena Headey, David Wenham, Dominic West, Vincent Regan, Rodrigo Santoro, and Michael Fassbender.

Kingsman: The Secret Service," Zealousness best served unrestricted
","I remember the very first trailer for 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' almost a year ago being rather unremarkable in the way it portrayed the action and spy genre, sort of seeing it as a spy film playing safe and not giving it much thought. However, when a release date of October 2014 was pushed back to February 2015, and the trailers began to become more prolific, it seemed that the marketing team behind the film started to deal with the film in an entirely new sense. The trailers became a riot, showing so much craziness and complete insanity that one wondered what would be left to show in the actual film. I went from a generally dismissive attitude to genuinely being excited for, what I saw, a something totally new and fresh.'Kingsman' is exactly that; a film that slaughters convention and any and all expectations to create something completely unpredictable, zealous, and most importantly, highly enjoyable. The film opens by showing a mission in the Middle East, carried out by the honorable Kingsman, an elite spy organization. We see a Secret Agent by the name of Harry Hart (Colin Firth) try his best but fail to save the life of one of his fellow agents, leading him to deliver a medal of bravery to the man's widow and young son. He tells the song, Eggsy, that if they ever need any assistance to call the phone number on the back of the medal and state a special message.Seventeen years later, another Kingsman has fallen, leaving the organization questioning how to proceed against Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), a wealthy inventor who is dolling out free cell phone service in efforts to control the population and his henchman Gazelle (Sofia Boutella), equipped with sharp metal legs. Eggsy lives in London with his mother and abusive stepfather, and is arrested after stealing a thug's car at a local pub with some friends. He uses his sole phone call in prison to call the number on the back of the medal given to him as a child, and is bailed out by Harry, who wants him recruited for the secret service agency known as Kingsman in efforts to stop Valentine and company.The Kingsmen use a variety of sophisticated weaponry and fighting styles that would normally leave the untrained aggressor crippled and sore for weeks. Harry, however, is not an untrained aggressor, using suave tactics to brutalize his enemies or instigators and assure that justice be served in a fair manner. He takes Eggsy as his prodigy, showing him the ropes of a Kingsman and what it means to work for the organization, as it's more than just umbrella guns, knives that propel out of dress shoes, and inconspicuous grenades.Obviously, 'Kingsman' is a blatant parody of the Bond franchise, but it is so in the best possible manner. Rather than lazily parodying character names, mannerisms, and proposing direct references to films of the franchise, writers Jane Goldman and director Matthew Vaughn ('X-Men: First Class') lampoon style, which will always bear a greater longevity than mindless name-calling and spoofing in parodies. The key to the art of parody is in style and convention, which Goldman and Vaughn understand from the get-go. What results is an uproariously fun film that never runs out of energy and always provides something fresh in a currently overcrowded pool.'Kingsman' wisely comes amidst a time where the superhero genre and the spy/espionage genre are in their primes, but never adhering too much to one particular side, creating a joyful hybrid rather than yet another project to get lost in a sea of others. In what looks to be a big year for the superhero/action genre, 'Kingsman' provides those experiencing fatigue and dissatisfaction from the ubiquity of such projects with a pleasant sense of originality and style to their content that could've easily been just another example of muchness in a genre.The film is likely to play nicely, with generally little competition in the same vein and an obvious push with communities like Reddit and 4chan embracing the content for its simultaneous slickness and uniqueness. Moreover, the film plays nicely for people simply looking for a cinematic experience that appears to have a pulse after a month of general ho-hum and mediocre releases. There's an unabashed level of excitement the film bears during a time of unimpressive titles that will undoubtedly find ways to cheer up a crowd that has long been done a disservice so far this year.",9,3,11,16 February 2015
The Hangover Part III," Lazy, cynical, and mean-spirited - the end could've come sooner
","I watched Todd Phillips' original Hangover film in theaters under normal, unassuming circumstances and walked out believing I had just witnessed a comedic masterpiece. It had the luxury of appearing just funny enough from the trailers and the fact that it was released during the time where the Apatow-esque comedies began to take way after something of a comedy recession. I loved it and believed it was one of the strongest comedies of the last decade. Its sequel, released in 2011, was, to say the least, a colossal disappointment. It featured mostly the same premise, with slight location and plot changes, and wasn't assisted by creativity and curiosity in terms of where the plot was going to go, unlike its predecessor.And now the inevitable Hangover: Part III is out, which is unworthy of bearing the franchise's name and certainly isn't good enough for the Roman Numerals in its title. This time the film doesn't amplify something that was done previously only significantly better, but instead makes this a cynical, mean-spirited follow-up featuring characters we grew to like in the original but now sort-of can't wait to see gone. The posters for the film boldly claim 'The End' and my only response is 'You're Late.' The film reunites Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), Doug (Justin Bartha), and Alan (Zach Galifianakis), the notorious 'Wolfpack' who decides that after Alan's recent stint with a giraffe on a freeway that he needs to be taken to rehab and put back on medication. The four decide to travel to Arizona together, when they are run off the road by Marshall (John Goodman, in perhaps the strongest performance of the entire franchise), a gangster who has been robbed off $21 million worth of gold from Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong). Being that the Wolfpack were close with Chow, Marshall kidnaps Doug and demands that Chow and his gold be returned to him. Cue the barrage of silliness and misunderstandings now.The main difference between the two previous Hangover films and this third installment is that this one takes an approach more in line with an action film than a comedy. I see something more reminiscent to a Bad Boys III rather than the final installment to a long-running comedy trilogy. Actions scenes evoke the quickest and most irrevocable kind of monotony and with a series that is already beginning to feel like it has been carried out way past its prime, this only cements it.And if that doesn't turn you off, the belittling mental illness subplot and the animal cruelty will likely do the trick. With Alan being off his medication, the character is given the most screen time in the film. Not to mention, Chow is given much more as well, and if we learn anything, it's that these two characters were better in small doses. Alan's dim-witted comedy and Chow's drug-related witticisms were at one time fun and fresh, but now, stale and flavorless. Furthermore, this is by far one of the most aggressive Hangover pictures in terms of what it portrays as comedy. It must be something of record that a one-hundred minute mainstream movies features the decapitation of a giraffe, the smothering of a rooster, and the poisoning of two dogs in an attempt to create humor. It's a sick, deplorable tactic that Phillips, who has shown his talent for giving characters something fun to talk about, uses in order to drum up either controversy or laughs or both.Had the original Hangover stood on its own, not possessing sequels of lesser quality leaching off its name, it could've very well become a classic in the next several years. Not only that, it could've been seen as a studio marvel, one that didn't need to 'push the envelope' with sequels and redundant attempts to break taboos. Alas, it is too late and it's a shame the untold millions the previous sequel grossed and the final installment will inevitably gross are put to two lesser films. I end with the the encompassing hope that the taglines for this film prove prophetic.Staring: Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zack Galifianakis, Justin Bartha, Ken Jeong, John Goodman, and Mike Epps.

Easy A," A John Hughes Teenager Movie Minus John Hughes
","Easy A does something almost no teenager movie does nowadays. It takes the theme and overall feel of a John Hughes movie. That alone awards the film two stars that it goes down the path of a true director/writer/producer. John Hughes was an inspiration and a legend in the filmmaking industry who's films will never even be matched by movies in the future. Though Easy A is well aware John Hughes is no part of this, but it takes elements and treats it like Hughes Gold which is the part I like. It even shows clips from The Breakfast Club, Say Anything, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and Sixteen Candles in comparison to our lead character which was something I thought was dead in movies. Never would I have thought a current film, made in 2010, utilize and reflect on the characters brought to us on a piece of art made by John Hughes.Emma Stone is a woman of talent. Her perky attitude and gorgeous smile makes her one of the top female actresses in Hollywood today. This movie makes her. She was backup in Superbad and Zombieland now she finally gets the lead role spot she deserves. Every actor/actress needs a lead movie role, but only few put them on top. While Taylor Lautner had a role when he was younger in The Adventures of Sharkboy & Lavagirl, but girls didn't start paying attention to his abs until his breakout with The Twilight Saga finally emerged and since then he has been labeled 'hot' by every girl in the United States. With Emma Stone's first real lead role in a movie she does a remarkable job and is just a pleasure to see on screen.The plot involves Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone), a clean cut High School student who is overheard by the religious fanatic girl Marianne (Amanda Bynes) while talking with her best friend. Olive and her friend Rhiannon (Aly Michalka) mention the word 'virginity' and 'sex' a few times leaving Marianne under the assumption Olive lost her virginity over the weekend. The rumor spreads throughout the High School (coming from someone who got of the middle school bus not to long ago I can say rumors spread faster than the news of Michael Jackson's death) and everyone now labels Olive as a Jezebel, slut, tramp, every derogatory name in the book.Olive figures that if people think she's a slut, she'll show no shame in acting like one, sewing a scarlet 'A' on her clothing, a reference from Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel 'The Scarlet Letter' which Olive is reading in her English class. Both coincide with each other since Olive and 'The Scarlet Letter''s character Hester both are in the boat of dealing with sexual abstinence and taking very similar acts and approaches in the film. Things only get worse when after her homosexual friend is tormented at school and begs her to have 'fake sex' with him at a party so he will be the 'stud' and not looked down upon. Olive goes into business doing this for other kids and it only sinks her reputation lower and lower.This film definitely takes a path of it's own when it seems it's following the crowd. I couldn't tell you the wasteland of crap teen movies we have nowadays. In fact, I believe the last good teen film of the 2000 - 2009 decade I saw was Mean Girls a few months ago. So starting off the decade with something like this is excellent. it's in no way recycled. While the teenager plot can be excused because that part just establishes the overall attitude and sense of the film. But having being parallel to a novel and having a perky, upbeat, never dull premise and characters I was consistently amused at Easy A's constant effort and how high in quality it held in an attempt to be like a John Hughes film.Easy A is Emma Stone's gem in her filmography. This will be her best movie for a long time. While her part in Superbad was only brief and her role in Zombieland wasn't her at all as she played a Gothic/Emo character which was out of the ordinary. Easy A pretty much establishes a personality close to hers. Excusing the sexual abstinence part, she probably is a 'clean cut High School girl'. The topic of sexual abstinence is one usually overshadowed by safe sex and is rarely talked about among parental conversations I can assure, but overall, it is dealt with well in this movie and the outcome is nothing but satisfying. It's also refreshing to here Simple Minds' amazing song 'Don't You Forget About Me' in a new movie and the reflection of John Hughes clips. That is the cherry on the sundae.Starring: Emma Stone, Penn Badgley, Amanda Bynes, Thomas Haden Church, Patricia Clarkson, Cam Gigandet, Lisa Kudrow, Malcolm McDowell, Alyson Michalka, Stanley Tucci.

Fast Five," The point where the series is basically going into space
","How many film franchises that struggled to merit strong critical reception to match their copious box office earnings can say that, in the eyes of the masses, they got it right the fifth time? The Fast and the Furious franchise is one of the only ones I can think of in that respect, and this is largely because where most franchises would admit they've run out of gas and are having difficultly finding new ground to cover, The Fast and the Furious buckled off and took a detour when it really needed it. When the previous installment, Fast & Furious, failed to excite even die-hard fans, the result for Fast Five was for writer Chris Morgan to continue to embed that grittier style he toyed with in the fourth film to the franchise's formula. The result is a film that plays more like The Italian Job than a Fast and the Furious film, as the emphasis on cars is downgraded considerably to just one street race at the end and the emphasis on the film is a lot of masculine energy in gun fights, fistfights, and a central heist in the storyline.All of this is well and good, and maybe this is what Fast and the Furious began asking for after the fourth film, but for me, this feels like this series went through metamorphosis and became something it was never supposed to be nor foreseen to be. The action setpieces in the film are all undeniably strong in how well they are articulated - especially one in particular which I'll address later - and the level of energy over the course of two hours, the longest runtime a film in the series has boasted thus far, never depletes or falters. However, Fast Five abandons what made the series so likable in the beginning, and turned it into a glossy action film that feels like the highlight reel from an action film. If the first two films in this series were underground street-racing events, this film is the antiseptic showroom floor of a Ferrari dealership.We follow the same characters we have in previous installments, specifically Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), the cop-turned-street-racer-turned-cop-again-turned-street-racer and his friends Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster). In the opening scene of the film, Brian winds up preventing Dom from going back to jail by causing a large pileup involving the bus Dom is being transported on. Miraculously, nobody else on the bus is hurt and only Dom escapes, with the crew fleeing to Rio de Janeiro. It doesn't take long for U.S. Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson) to get hot on Dom's trail, especially when the group hatches a plan to steal $100 million from a corrupt business tycoon named Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida).In order to pull off such a high-caliber operation, they enlist in some old friends Fast and the Furious fans may recognize. Roman Pierce (Tyrese Gibson), a longtime friend of Brian's is one of them, along with both street-racer and criminal opportunist Han (Sang Kung) and street-race organizer Tej Parker (Ludicrous). All together, the gang assembles like Marvel's Avengers and attempts an international crackdown of epic proportions.Fast Five is the point in the franchise where the series goes to space in order to try and desperately invoke some sort of life and new concepts into their tired formula. The cockamamie qualities of Fast Five might as well have the entire cast beaming up to a different planet or a galaxy far, far away for how incredulous things become in this film. That's not to say the earlier films weren't, but Fast & Furious and Fast Five's jarring tonal shifts work to suck all the fun and juvenile sentiments out of a franchise that boasted them like oscillating rims on a fresh new import.The film isn't a total loss, as some scenes are particularly energetic and provide for some comic absurdity. Consider the scene I alluded to earlier, where Brian and Dom are in separate vehicles both hauling a huge, steel safe across a highway with cops on their tale. Just before they get to the highway, however, they are driving through crowded metropolitan streets, turning corners so sharply and quickly that the safe can barely do anything besides topple over, jackknife, and subsequently shatter the walls and fronts of buildings alongside the road. The repeated collisions between the wall and the safe, which is about half the size of a boxcar on a freight train, doesn't make it come loose nor does it cause any disturbance on part of Brian and Dom as the drivers hurling the safe through the streets. Watching this mesmerizing event is like watching the laws of physics slowly implode on themselves, and it occurred to me that if people started elevating from the ground as if they were being sucked into the heavens in that same particular scene, or at any point throughout this film for that matter, the film's own laws of logic would not be compromised.The original two films offered such an inviting and homey quality to the street racers; where the characters had to avoid the cops in the nick of time or face potentially catastrophic penalties and fines. It was the kind of cheery little thing many people in the audience could presumably relate to. The franchise has now extended itself to the point where street-racing and cars have become secondary in hopes to reach a broader audience; how that isn't viewed by the audience as the franchise selling out is a mystery to me. Fast Five is certainly fast in terms of pacing and editing, and it's also indeed the fifth film in this franchise, but just maybe, besides the multiple 'the''s and 'and''s misplaced from this film's title, this franchise is running out of gas and is afraid to really show it.",4,1,4,15 December 2015
Fantastic Four," Captures a time when superhero films were more joyful
","Fantastic Four is one of the last superhero films, that I can recall, that wasn't insufferably bleak or incredibly serious to a point where any shred of humor was seen as obtuse to the film's narrative. Yes, Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy is an indisputable breakthrough in superhero films, but it also made the seriousness of superhero films standard, something that would follow into the late 2000's and early 2010's as Marvel built up The Avengers. Fantastic Four reminds of the quirkiness superhero films were once predicated upon, and while it may get a bit too corny at times, and its focus can never really settle, it's also a very commercial film that satisfies on some level of entertainment when it gives every card in its deck a fair time to shine.We open by looking at a physicist named Dr. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), who is convinced evolution was triggered millions of years ago by stray elements of cosmic energy in space, some of which will pass near Earth very soon. His pal, astronaut Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), works by his side on this potentially revolutionary discovery by helping him convince their old classmate Dr. Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon), the CEO of Von Doom Industries, to allow both of them access to his private space station to further experiment with the effects of these cosmic energy particles. While Doom agrees, he winds up walking away with most of the profits that this experiment will bring, affirming Reed's desperation to make his project work.Still, he persists on and brings his close friends Susan Storm (Jessica Alba) and her brother Johnny (Chris Evans) along for the ride. However, when a trip to outer space goes awry, exposure with the cosmic energy results in the four receiving deformities and enhanced human abilities that have never before been seen: Reed possesses the ability to stretch every limb of his body, Susan has the ability to disappear and reappear at her leisure, Johnny can have his body engulfed in flame simply by reciting the phrase 'Flame on!,' and Ben turns into a hideous, orange rock monster.Following the four's mutations, writers Michael France and Mark Frost focus a great deal of their time on the agony that these mutations bring, particularly The Thing, who experiences his wife leaving him shortly after revealing his deformity. While this agony is a solid angle (one I'd argue necessary in most superhero films), too much of the time is spent profiling The Thing and not enough on the remaining characters of the film. Reed and Ben, who are ultimately the film's main focus, wind up monopolizing too much of the picture, and any time we see Johnny is when he's right in the middle of making a smug comment or being his typical, womanizing self.The action in Fantastic Four has a colorful commercial look to it, brilliantly bold and very vibrant in a way that makes many of the scenes pop with life. It manages to achieve a comic book aesthetic without resorting to picture-in-picture editing. One particularly involving scene takes place on a suspension bridge, where The Thing is seen pummeling everything in his sight and the remaining three members of the team must resort to either relaxing him or protecting drivers and innocent bystanders.The goofiness in Fantastic Four, however, in an age of dark superhero films that come with slick aesthetics and brooding characters, is a delightful change of pace. Yes, there is a point when one wishes director Tim Story, France, and Frost would command a tighter grip on the seriousness of the writing, but the pulpy fun of Fantastic Four, in addition to the effects and the neatly choreographed action, keep it a moving, satisfying spectacle that is more than just colors flying around on screen, trying to find their place.Starring: Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, Michael Chiklis, and Julian McMahon.

Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," A continuation that doesn't have a right to be this good
","'Empire had the better ending; Luke gets his hand cut off, finds out Vader's his father, Han gets frozen, and taken away by Bobba Fett, it ends on such a downnote. That's what life is, a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.' - Dante Hicks, Clerks.One of my other justifications for remaining ignorant to the Star Wars franchise was the fact that I felt I had already seen them before. After hearing the above lines in Kevin Smith's Clerks, I had no ambition to seek out the series because of the fact that I already knew all, or most, of the major, visceral plot points in the second installment, The Empire Strikes Back. But even knowing these details going in, I still emerged as enthralled and as taken as ever. It's one of the most awe-inspiring, gripping sequels I've ever seen.My love for the series of Star Wars, so far, has likely been because I don't try to understand it all. I allow myself to sink into the films, letting the film's imagination, and my own, take me on a cinematic Odyssey. The less I look into the meaning of it all and the interworkings of the characters and series, the more, I feel, I see in terms of vision, writing, atmosphere, and style. Thank goodness I took this approach to The Empire Strikes Back, which employs all these elements with slick, constant entertainment. It abandons the cheery, free-spirited style of its predecessor in favor of a much dark enigma. Never before have I seen a film go from comforting entertainment to sheer calamity within one sequel.Perhaps much of this is thanks to Irvin Kershner, who takes over for Lucas in the directing department. After achieving monstrous success with the original Star Wars, against all conceivable odds, Lucas, who was perplexed at how to follow up the hit, sidelined himself to executive producer and hired Kershner to lend his vision with the screen. New writers by the names of Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan were hired to continue the harrowing tales of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), and Han Solo (Harrison Ford). I couldn't imagine the hesitation amongst fans when these creative decisions were made. They must've expected the absolute worst from a sequel to an explosive hit. Could it be like the extreme hesitation the Star Wars fanbase currently has now with J.J Abrams manning the camera and Michael Ardnt writing the script for the forthcoming Star Wars: Episode VII in 2015, or should I not even mention that? The wonderful thing about these new faces being the driving forces behind this film is that we get a different spin on these characters and their lives that isn't drab, redundant, or contrived. Had The Empire Strikes Back adopted the same sort of easy-going charisma of its predecessor, this could've easily been a cheap rehash of previously successful material. Instead, Kerschner, Brackett, and Kasdan wisely choose to further develop these characters, making their problems more three-dimensional, their personalities more vivid, and their biographies more interesting.Again, there are some terrific and grandiose special effects put to use here. The effects on the Millennium Falcon and the exterior shots of a galaxy far, far away is just marvelous and very appealing on the eyes. I'm always amazed at the naturalism of these effects, even for the late seventies/early eighties. Despite being largely products of computers and other visual mediums, they still possess an authentic and wonderfully realistic look to them.One particular instance is when Han, Leia, and the rest of the gang fly their ship into the asteroid farm, which is exactly what it sounds like. Dozens of asteroids hurl themselves at the ship at breakneck speeds, leaving Han (the driver) with little time to react and dodge them. The animation and visual technique of the asteroids is astonishing, and every moving object adopts gorgeous fluency and technical precision. It's a visual wonder to say the very least.The Empire Strikes Back beautifully carries the Star Wars franchise further than it might've even gone under the intense and uncompromising care of Lucas himself. The new faces delightfully provide us with more entertaining adventures and more eccentric characters such as Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz) and Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), consistently keeping us in-tuned and intrigued with the limitless possibilities of this creative world. Like before, Hamill, Fisher, and Ford provide the most likable of chemistry, and the scenes of intensity and peril do not fall short of enthralling, even if one is aware of the outcome. There are many directions Return of the Jedi can take, but if it shows the gripping intensity of its predecessor and the truly mysterious nature of its original, then the possibilities are as endless as the galaxy the series inhabits.Starring: Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, James Earl Jones, Frank Oz (voice), and Billy Dee Williams.

Minions," An appetizer simply cannot serve as the main dish
","Watching 'Minions,' the latest installment in the 'Despicable Me' franchise, is like going to the finest restaurant in town and expecting an overpriced appetizer to fill you up so much so that a main course isn't even necessary. The Minions, the now-ubiquitous secondary characters from the aforementioned franchise, played second banana (no pun intended) to supervillain Gru and other characters, and while they provided for an cute, quickwitted diversion, forcing them into the forefront to maintain a feature-length spotlight was no doubt a daunting task for the writers and directors of this project. There's little chance that five years ago, a spin off film of these small, yellow, pill-like creature would've even been a thought in an animator's mind.'Minions' was a movie coming from a mile away. 'Despicable Me 2' hinted at its inevitable existence early on, with its teaser trailer focusing entirely on the creatures and carrying the characters over to the forefront of the film's marketing campaign. Furthermore, the amount of Minion merchandise, with everything from stuffed animals, Lego knockoffs, and Tic-Tacs being made in celebration of the film, comes close to the sickening level of franchising that Pixar's 'Cars' did. While even a hardened cynic would find it difficult not to at least crack a smile at the cuteness and insane likability of these little creatures, a ninety-minute affair with these rascals proves to be a muchness.The prelude to the film, most of which included in the theatrical trailer, bears some of the funniest, most relevant humor of the entire film. We see how Minions have inhabited the planet long before human beings, with one goal in mind - 'serve the most despicable master they could find.' The Minions worked for everyone, be it Dracula, a Tyrannosaurus Rex, Egyptian Pharaohs, and even Napoleon, all of whom wound up tragically killed at the fault of the Minions. Finally, after unintentionally killing their last master, the Minions set up their village in Antarctica, serving nobody else but themselves. This works for a little while, but the Minions gradually become aimless and disinterested in life, rapidly losing their ability to function.One brave Minion, Kevin (voiced by co-director Pierre Coffin, as all the Minion characters are), stands before the Minions to see who, if any, will venture out to unknown parts to return with a master that all the Minions can serve. When the roly-poly rebel Stuart is selected, in addition to the sweet and simple Bob, the trio set out to find their master, eventually getting word of a large gathering of villains at 'Villain-Con,' an annual convention. They hear of Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock), the evilest female supervillain in all the land, and make it their prime mission to serve her and all her needs upon visiting the convention.When you're in the company of sweet, primitive little yellow cylinders that bask in their own naive ways and speak a combination of languages amongst gibberish, it doesn't take much to realize that this film will undoubtedly inspire a few smiles and chuckles. However, sporadic smiles and chuckles do not usually amount to very good films, and because the Minions were once secondary characters that did just that, and are rather limited characters in a narrative sense, it's difficult for them to break out and be much more.Because the Minions can't speak in a manner that we, humans, can decipher, the story must be kept simple and linear, something that DreamWorks does to a fault here. This is a film, I feel, is destined to only satisfy little kids, who are overjoyed that this film doesn't bear the kind of emotional and narrative weight Pixar's 'Inside Out' did. The simplicity of the story, again, allows for a handful of cute moments, and some remarkably limber comedic setups, but once you realize how light, airy, and forgettable the film's characters and aura is, it's then 'Minions' begins to fade from your mind before the end credits even begin to roll.",4,4,14,13 July 2015
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," An animated odyssey
","The films of the Madagascar franchise link together in a way rarely seen in the new age of cinema. Sequels tend to usually take place 'x' amount of years after their predecessor, but here, it seems that each film picks up not long after the first previous one ends. I recommend to parents that if they find nothing to do on a specific day, then watching all three films of the Madagascar franchise in a row (since they're all relatively simple, fast watches at no more than eighty minutes a film) would be an ideal exercise.Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted is an unlikely sequel because, like its predecessor, Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, the film improves from its original, a rather kinetic and unusually rambunctious animated film. After rewatching both films to prepare myself for this excursion, I was very surprised at my reactions towards both. I haven't seen each film in their entirety since both of their theatrical release weekends, and my views on each film sort of swapped. When I originally watched them, I found the original Madagascar to be a smooth and satisfying picture, while I sort of gave the second film the colder shoulder. My views have directly changed, and I think the opposite of both pictures.The third film provides us with some of the same things we've seen prior to this outing, but also adds some new elements with confidence. Our heroes have been through so much, that if you've seen the first two films, it's hard not to feel some sympathy while watching this one. Alex the lion (voiced by Ben Stiller), Marty the zebra (Chris Rock), Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmer) open the film, still stranded in the sunlit fields of Africa awaiting the return of the four penguins and the two monkeys who took off to Monte Carlo in another junkyard plane to visit the luxurious casinos. They make the simple, painless trip to Monte Carlo to try and recover them to make it home to their zoo in New York City.Once there, they make a big spectacle at a casino, similar to how they created ruckus at Grand Central Station in the original film, and the animals, monkeys, penguins, and King Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen) along with his two sidekicks, Maurice (Cedric the Entertainer) and Mort (Andy Richter) immediately capture the attention of the Monaco Animal Control officer Captain Chantel DuBois (Frances McDormand). After breathlessly chasing them through the streets of London, the heroes manage to escape in a car-turned-plane to France, where the four zoo animals manage to hitch a ride with a traveling circus.Bear with me here, as I'm having a truly difficult time summarizing this coherently. The four wind up purchasing the deed to the circus, and then realize that it's a rundown hack of an event, with has-been acts and a stubborn lion named Vitaly (Bryan Cranston), whose act of jumping through rings as small as an engagement band cost him his luscious fur coat and left him with a morose outlook on life. The four learn that if they manage to get an American sponsor to invest in the circus, they could potentially return home to New York City as an act.This then spawns a frenetic and rambunctious journey through all formulas of animated films, from heart, to chaos, to adventure, to sentimentality, to ruckus, etc. While the original film seemed concerned with bringing manic sensibilities to the screen and the second film the sentimental and somewhat saddening side of the screenplay to light, Madagascar 3 seems determined to blend the two personalities. As convoluted and as desperate as it sounds, it actually makes for a very convincing ride.Probably the most entertaining part is during the latter half of the second act when the animals put on a beautifully choreographed sound-and-light show in London to the music of Katy Perry's infectiously over-played anthem 'Firework.' While this perhaps isn't the most coherent animated film in a long time, being very sketchy, jumbled, and very, very springy in its narrative, it has its heart in the right place, and, let's face it, these characters, by the end of this movie, come off as likable scamps. Perhaps it's because I grew up with them, but even to a cynic, they manage to summon a smile to my face. For a series once reliant so heavily on hyperactive instincts and bathroom humor, it has matured and came of age nicely. Hopefully, so have most of the film's original fans.Voiced by: Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett Smith, David Schwimmer, Sacha Baron Cohen, Cedric the Entertainer, Andy Richter, Frances McDormand, Bryan Cranston, Jessica Chastain, and Martin Short.

Inside Llewyn Davis," Plunges you into its character's world and bathes you with his emotions
","While watching Joel and Ethan Coen's Inside Llewyn Davis, a film that undoubtedly details a fierce bout of depression its titular character is battling, I became deeply upset and sorrowful, to the point of simply not saying much while viewing it, lumbering through the remainder of my night, and finally, going to bed with a lump in my throat. I awake this morning to write the film's review in a more refreshed but still fragile state-of-mind.This is one of the strongest impacts a film has had on me in quite sometime. On this basis alone, the film deserves a glowing review, but thankfully, the film is stuffed with greatness that appears to be bursting from the seams, so that part isn't tricky. What's tricky is to convince you, the reader who perhaps hasn't seen Inside Llewyn Davis, why it's so great and why it's the next film you need to see. My only condition before continuing is you promise not to ignore this recommendation because the film is 'depressing' or 'sad.' Set in New York City's Greenwich Village in 1961, the film follows a week in the life of Llewyn Davis (Oscar Issac), a depressed and struggling folk singer, who has just lost his singing partner Mike Timlin after he throws himself off the George Washington Bridge. Llewyn is now stuck in a funk, forced to continue his singing career by himself, which we can see isn't going so well. Llewyn's performances in folk lounges and in impromptu meeting sessions is great, but one can tell he stood behind his partner Mike when performing. Llewyn clearly needs someone to help him sound more polished, but because he's forced to be on his own, this makes getting gigs and being accepted into the folk world that much more difficult.Llewyn is as wayward as one can be, currently not living anywhere, and frequently staying in the apartment of his closest acquaintances Jim (Justin Timberlake) and Jean (Carey Mulligan). Jim finds Llewyn to be a good guy to work with, while Jean loathes him; she tells him to his face that he is 'King Midas's idiot brother,' for everything he touches turns to s***. Jean also reveals to Llewyn that she is pregnant, and fearing that there is a chance that Llewyn could be the father, decides to abort the child to do away with it entirely. Everywhere Llewyn goes, he finds little to no acceptance; even a mildly optimistic drive to Chicago with two other musicians results in Jazz musician Roland Turner (John Goodman) browbeating him the whole way. His only companion is his neighbor's (metaphorical) cat, whom Llewyn guards with his life and lugs around with him wherever he goes, despite frequently losing it.Watching Llewyn be verbally assaulted, mistreated, and unappreciated, you just want to shed tears, which is what I did within minutes of the film. During the first few minutes, we hear the beautifully-sung tune 'Fare Thee Well,' which Llewyn sung with Mike, while watching a clearly broken Llewyn riding the subway with the cat he so lovingly protects from danger. Yet, despite a scene like this, one questions how much we can sympathize with Llewyn. While he is clearly facing a deep, professionally and emotionally affecting depression, we see him neglect important things, like the feelings of his acquaintances, personal responsibilities, his constant refusal to compromise, and so forth. Some viewers may find Llewyn difficult to sympathize with; once you realize that many of his actions are likely attributable to his severe bout of depression is when the character becomes easy to have sympathy for.Llewyn wouldn't be the character he is without the help of Oscar Isaac, an incredible new find of an actor who you will hear more and more about in the next few years - mark my words. Isaac nails the beautiful nuances and facial expressions that indicate something is right with our protagonist. He handles the outbursts, the heartbreak, the smug wit, and the complications of Llewyn with biting realism and understated craft, never becoming too over-the-top nor too subtle and inhuman. Other talents that encompass the picture are Mulligan, Timberlake, and Goodman, all of which bringing their own character to the table in an effective manner.Then there's the incredible music and cinematography that just loan themselves to the material at hand. The music, first and foremost, is riveting, built from the ground up on some of the catchiest and most memorable folk ballads you've heard in years. From the exceptional 'Fare Thee Well,' to the goofy and infectious 'Please Mr. Kennedy,' the smooth and soothing 'Five Hundred Miles,' and the somber performances of 'Hang Me, Oh Hang Me' by Llewyn, which bookends the film, everything about the picture's soundtrack is moving and effective. Then there's the beautifully bleak visuals, thanks to renowned cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel, who effectively personifies depression through the film's excessive black and gray visuals. If you call the film's palette of colors 'ugly,' you're only reemphasizing the feelings of the protagonist of the film.Inside Llewyn Davis plunges you into its lead character's world utilizing what could be classifiable as mumblecore filmmaking techniques, giving you many different emotions to feel and many different instances that you can either quietly laugh at or simply sulk at. Watching this film, as stated, was an incredibly emotional experience for myself, not on a personal level but a human level. The Coen brothers have gone on to detail one of the best films about depression and loss that I have yet to see and, in addition, have made a film that speaks to the folk music world in a lyrics and themes far too many of them probably understand.",10,1,2,30 April 2014
Sin City," A graphic novel almost literally brought to life
","Frank Miller's, Robert Rodriguez's, and (sometimes) Quentin Tarantino's Sin City is the very definition of a graphic novel brought to life; a beautifully photographed, realized depiction of a smutty city, soaked in saturated black and white photography, with only sporadic primary colors blue, red, and yellow finding their way on screen in the occasion. A dark, moody crime thriller, easily publishable under the category of film noir (or even neo-noir, as it's known in its contemporary form), Sin City offers the viewer and immersing two hours in a seedy city known as Basin City, a fictional, crime-infested, and three of its shadiest characters.The first is John Hartigan, an aging, veteran police officer played by Bruce Willis. In a town thriving on the self-fulfillment and gratification of others, Hartigan is selfless, always putting himself on the line for the greater good of Basin City's questionably deserving souls. We see Hartigan work to stop a serial killer who's victims have been children and is about to rape and kill fourth soul, as well as try to involve himself in more corruption that plagues Basin City.The next character we see is Marv (Mickey Rourke), a physically undesirable but thoroughly interesting soul. Marv is about seven-foot tall, broodish, unattractive, and build like a werewolf in leather clothing. Scars litter his face and ice seems to run through his veins, substituting blood. Marv is hung up on a hooker he met named Goldie, who looked like the human descent of an angel, desirable, illuminating, and unbelievably lovely to him in every way. After she is murdered, he looks to avenge her death in the only way he - and the rest of Basin City - knows how, which is through uncompromising, brutal, and bloody violence.Finally, there's Dwight (Clive Owen), who is caught in the middle of a vicious and abusive love-triangle between his current girlfriend Shellie (Brittany Murphy) and her physically-tormenting ex Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro). Despite being seeing Jackie armed with cronies and an arsenal full of tricks and manipulative tactics, Dwight fights to keep Shellie safe, as well as banding together a group of Basin City misfits, drifters, and prostitutes in order to form an uprising against Jackie Boy and his demeaning ways.Basin City is far too diverse and populated to simply make a film focusing on one character for the full one-hundred and twenty-three minutes, so it's nice to see that writers Elizabeth Avellan, Miller, and Rodriguez make the film as fleshed out as possible in terms of the numbers of characters there are, yet still work to develop them all. Immediately, however, the film attracts and dazzles because of its visual scheme; an almost consistently black-and-white color palette, with other occasional colors sharing small parts of the screen (like red dresses, blood, a blue-eyed prostitute, and a venomous 'Yellow Bastard') makes for a rich style that completely complements the original graphic novel of Miller's. Basin City is captured in a dark, muggy light, always caught in the middle of a light rainstorm/drizzle, and consistently finding ways to be simultaneously bleak yet wholly immersing. Never has a film in the 2000's look and bled (quite literally) like a film noir).Sin City's only real misstep is that it occasionally becomes too kill-happy, focusing on the murderous rampages, excessive violence, and brutality and forgets either the characters behind them, or, predominately, the story, which can often be a muddle. While film noir movies are sometimes known for their unclear plots, Sin City does have a pretty clear one - mainly functioning as an anthology between characters - but its narrative richness could be more compelling had a foot been taking off the gas of the violence a few times. Yet this is not enough to derail the aesthetically sublime and, for the most part, well-acted display of neo-noir affects that work to create one of the most immersing films based solely on location that I've ever seen.Starring: Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Benicio Del Toro, Jessica Alba, Brittany Murphy, Elijah Wood, and Powers Boothe.

Gangs of New York," These streets will one day morph into something great. Watching this you wouldn't have thought so.
","Director Martin Scorsese's deep fascination with the underground gangster lifestyle and complex inter-workings of illegal operations has led him to backtrack when gangs blatantly controlled the streets of what would soon become the most active and functioning city in America. Gangs of New York is a wickedly effective film, dark and crisp in most fields, including scenes that could easily be dubbed heartless and dehumanizing. Despite these traits, it makes for a devilishly entertaining film of epic length.I have mentioned before that Martin Scorsese is one of my favorite filmmakers and is often, what I consider to be, a treasure taken for granted. When we look at his films, many of see a great story, with superb performances, and a very long runtime. We don't see the intricate aspects that make every one of his films surpass all expectations. My personal favorite of his, Casino from 1995, is one of his longest films, and is exquisitely written and directed, but is also shot with so much care and attention to detail. Shots are vibrant, cinematography and atmosphere are evoked in a limitless state, and every scene is electrifying, right up until the final sequences which some have dubbed 'visually disturbing.' But on with Gangs. It is a wonderful period piece, with more life and enigma that many of its kind. Early scenes show us Lower Manhattan's Five Points in 1846, where the nativists, lead by the notorious and deeply depraved cynic William 'Bill the Butcher' Cutting (Lewis), are about to square-off and battle with the Irish gang the 'Dead Rabbits' run by Priest Vallon (Neeson). The battle erupts after a long, ominous silence occurs as the two groups find each other in the stone-cold street. When it begins, it rarely lets up. It is brutal, bloody, and downright tantalizing as many men are beaten and stabbed, till dozens of lifeless bodies crowd the street. Vallon is murdered, as his young son Amsterdam witnesses the unforgiving assembly of violence. He is shipped off to an orphanage, never to be seen again.Until sixteen years later, where he among many other Irish immigrants arrive on a boat where they unload into the bitter streets of New York. Amsterdam is played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who drifts about as far away from the pretty-boy image as one could get, after portraying a passionate romantic in James Cameron's classic just five years prior. Amsterdam's goal is to seek out revenge for his father's death, and is willing to go through great lengths to obtain it. It's a dish best served cold, and he wants it with extra ice.The performances, like in any other Scorsese picture, are intricate, marvelous, and absolutely engaging. While DiCaprio is sure to please the crowd, the standout is none other than Daniel Day-Lewis as the Butcher. The character is quite possibly the most ruthless and soulless villain the year 2002 had ever seen, and what could've morphed into a one-dimensional, ridiculous antagonist, comes off and bleeds complexity and evil. Pure, unadulterated, fearful evil.A plethora of secondary characters keep the film going as well. Brendan Gleeson and John C. Reilly have wonderful roles, and Jim Broadbent gets some much-deserved screen time as the corrupt and desperate Boss Tweed, who will go to any length to receive votes in the forthcoming election. Like in any Scorsese film, there is a love story with the main character, this time involving the crafty con-woman Jenny, played by Cameron Diaz. While Diaz is fun to watch and is possibly doing some of her best work, she always seems to be one-upped by Day-Lewis' and DiCaprio's respective characters.Some have written off Gangs as Scorsese's 'messy masterpiece,' when it really is an interestingly made epic providing commentary on America's explicit xenophobia at the time. It's 2012, and in a time where the immigration issue immediately turns heads, this film provides the brutally honest retelling of the nativists' reception without being too hokey, biased, or heavy-handed. The film holds off on coating the story with sugar and sweetness because we have been told the soft-side of history for far too long.And that's why I like the film so much; it's daring and honest. It has a heavy layer of cynicism, that some may find too smothering and too mean-spirited. We can't always be told the mild side of things, when there is a much greater lesson to be taught. Cynicism and pessimism are part of life, and as soon as we can realize that, the sooner we will be far more educated about the world around us.Gangs of New York tells a story that hasn't been brought up too often, and its result is definitely commendable. Consistent readers will take note that this is the first film by Scorsese that I have not awarded a perfect rating. One of the greatest emotions a film can bring to a person is the feeling of sadness and depression, and I have walked away with that feeling in all of Scorsese's previous pictures, with the notable exception of Hugo. When Gangs ends, it feels like it has ended, and we are just left contemplating the great change New York has endured since 1862. Not much else. Regardless, this is a beautifully made film with enriching cinematography, beyond capable performances from actors of all different statuses, and refuses to sugarcoat history although it is in a great position to do so.Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis, Cameron Diaz, Brendan Gleeson, John C. Reilly, and Liam Neeson. Directed by: Martin Scorsese.",9,0,0,5 April 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," You think you know, but you really don't know. And you never will.
","Cultists and horror fans rejoice. The genre is long from dead. Especially since we have people like Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon hellbent on filing the rough edges and cementing the cracks. For years we have been met with shameless remakes, lame sequels, found footage disasters, and only once in a while does a solid, tolerable horror flick break through the bleak and droning clutter. Here, we have an original, crafty, and exciting flick in the genre that resorts to not only mocking the clichés commonly used in horror films but also possibly inventing some new ones of its own.This is the last thing I was expecting to say about a film titled The Cabin in the Woods, but after months of anticipation and article after article it has finally been released. I remember the original plot that was leaked on IMDb in January; 'Five friends go to a remote cabin in the woods. Bad things happen.' I thought to myself 'you already have a film with a trite, uninspired title and now you release a plot that doesn't even try?' Little did I know I was being played. I saw the first trailer and was mesmerized. What would appear to be a stock, wooden (pun intended) exercise mixed with a heap of tired, worn clichés was what looked to be a promising and intelligent horror film. Those thoughts stay with me after viewing as well.Usually in my reviews I try and give a sufficient description of the plot. For Cabin in the Woods, I refuse. You're left with your wits, your assumptions, and that simple premise I quoted. I went in with that knowledge and the camaraderie I witnessed in the trailers. There's absolutely no reason anything else has to be said or given away. The five characters are standard horror archetypes that we've seen a countless number of times, and the film isn't shy about reminding us. The last twenty-five minutes of the film are relentless and, by then, the movie's title seemed to be practically void and nonexistent to me.There's just one issue I have; the film seems to have swapped a lot of the horror elements for cheap, slightly-amusing comedy bits that sometimes obscure direction. I've never been too big on horror comedies, but it seems Cabin in the Woods would have benefited from more thriller elements than corny comedy skits.But that doesn't overshadow the fact that this is a bold and unrestricted film, so far off the map of typical horror-fare that some newer films aren't even in sight. Some readers might remember my abashed review of The Devil Inside, but my faith in horror has become somewhat restored after watching Cabin. I recently watched a documentary called Comic-Con Episode IV: A Fan's Hope, which Cabin's screenwriter Whedon was a part of. Seeing as he was a long time writer for Buffy the Vampire Slayer and directed and wrote the upcoming superhero film The Avengers, it seems he speaks to the group of superfans and nerds. Those who camp out at night to be the first one to see a film, buy a game/console, or those who seek to form and join a number of cults. We need more people in the business like Whedon. I'm always weary when old directors try out new tricks. What does it tell us when Goddard and Whedon's Cabin in the Woods was more subtle, fulfilling, and fun than Wes Craven's My Soul to Take? It's also a blessing to see Cabin get a substantial release in 2D. Originally, when the rights were under MGM's name, an up-conversion to 3D was proposed and thankfully abandoned. I found parts of Cabin to be a tad dark and hazy. Glasses that add an extra dimension that noticeably dim the light of a picture would've tarnished the experience. Maybe if I had some of the stuff Marty (Kranz) had everything would become clear to me. Everything except the turns.Starring: Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth, Anna Hutchison, Fran Kranz, Jesse Williams, Richard Jenkins, and Bradley Whitford.

Joy," A nicely orchestrated, subtle story of female empowerment through realism and human interest
","It wasn't until about a week ago that I realized that I'd be seeing David O. Russell's 'Joy' on Christmas Day and was simultaneously struggling to make heads or tails of the film's plot. The film's trailer seemed like a very low-key picture about a single mother's redemption via self-realization and determination. It wasn't until the first hour of the film did I realize this film was a biopic on Joy Mangano, the self-made millionaire who found overnight success on QVC selling the Magic Mop and other household appliances that made for convenience or ease of use.Perhaps it's because of the general perception of biopics in American cinema being clichéd or far too common or the desire to make Mangano a more general character rather than a pop culture figure, but for whatever reason, the marketing team behind David O. Russell's latest film owe Mangano some kind of an apology. Not only was the promotion for this film so vague that it obscured her story to audiences, who may have even wanted to see the film, it also undermined what is otherwise a strong story about the cyclical patterns of being an entrepreneur in modern-day American and what it means to aspire to be more than a woman being forced into domesticity by restrictive parents.As stated, the film follows Joy Mangano, played by Jennifer Lawrence, who is living every woman's worst nightmare - a single mother feeling anchored by her two young children, living in a house with her separated mother and father, in addition to her ex-husband and grandmother. Throughout her entire life, all Joy has tried to do is make her modest life work to the best possible degree, but she continues to get bogged down by poor circumstance no matter which way she chooses to go.Her mother always taught her that she'd go to school and meet a fine young boy, have a few kids, and spend the remaining days of her life attending to a mid-sized home in addition to a few youngsters while her husband served as the breadwinner. Her father placed larger expectations upon her, despite quietly thinking that she couldn't bear such stress of maintaining a job and making a success out of herself. Most of this kind of external, outspoken negative and restrictive energy would have most women screaming about their own independence and their rightful freewill, but Joy just bottled it all up, saving it for a rainy day.The aforementioned storm comes when Joy decides to capitalize off of an idea she had in her mind for a one-of-a-kind mop: it's a mop with a head that would be able to absorb the contents of a large room, be rung out without touching the mop-head itself, and have the same mop-head be detachable for washer/dryer use. The idea just seems crazy and logical enough to work, which leads Joy to creating prototypes for such an invention and attempting to sell them at K-Mart to no avail. With that, Joy is lucky enough to find Neil Walker (Bradley Cooper), an executive at the QVC network who helps give Joy the necessary publicity and exposure to make her invention a hit and propel her to overnight stardom.'Joy' isn't your average story of rags-to-riches stardom, largely because the rags don't turn into longterm, or even momentary, riches. Every time Joy seems to get ahead, be it by achieving hundreds of thousands of sales of her mops on QVC or earning enough money to get out of debt, a new and uglier problem raises its head, be it the theft of her patent or her profits in some way. Joy makes multiple deals with the devil in terms of leaving herself vulnerable and helpless if things don't work out exactly the way she needs them to, including taking out a second mortgage against her home and borrowing copious amounts of money from her father's girlfriend all in the name of giving her daughters a better life.The biggest setback with 'Joy,' other than the lack of confidence in its story judging by the film's approach and the fact that it undercuts Mangano's namesake and significance for so long, like it's ashamed it exists to tell her story, is the disjointed direction. For the first hour, Russell conducts this film like a soap opera, undoubtedly juxtaposing the film with the ridiculous soap opera Joy's mother watches on a regular basis, by introducing numerous characters and numerous dramatic situations. Halfway through the film, Russell abandons this style to focus on Joy's rise to fame and the multiple setbacks she faces in a cynical world that ostensibly doesn't want her to succeed. Such dichotomous approaches would've worked well if they had served as the thesis for the two-hour film, but with this approach, the film comes off as woefully disconnected and miscommunicated.With all that in mind, 'Joy' is well worth seeing because of the way it handles its titular character in a way that shows her as a victim to reality and a lack of true moral support, despite her own muted, personal desire to succeed in a hungry world. The idea of an underdog trying to succeed and take their bite out of a world where everyone is hungry for their own piece isn't new; Russell's decision to focus on a real-life figure clawing her way to the top whilst getting spat in the face no matter what she does and tying it together in a way that emphasizes female empowerment in a way that doesn't feel like a motivational poster is, in fact, new. The only thing you, the viewer, is asked to do is forgive a few narrative setbacks and mixed delivery. As always, this cluttered Christmas Day weekend, the choice is yours.",7,9,25,25 December 2015
Her," It just may be a computer you're looking for...
","When I first heard about the film Her, I was filled to the brim with excitement and curiosity about the possibilities for the simple but thought-provoking story. However, I was fearful few would see the film as one that explores perhaps a forthcoming trend in relationships, and many would criticize the story's premise, dismissing it as 'weird' or silly. Thankfully, writer/director Spike Jonze rises above the challenges of creating the film and effectively bypasses all preconceived notions of it being odd for the sake of being odd. Her is a tender, shockingly soulful picture that also serves as one of the most immersing depictions of a relationship I've yet to see.Set in an unknown time in the future, the film stars Joaquin Phoenix, a contemporary gem of an actor, as Theodore Twombly, an introverted loner whose job is to write personal love-letters for people who cannot effectively express their words. Theodore has withdrawn more and more from the world because of his impending divorce with Catherine (Rooney Mara), a woman he fell in love with when he was much younger, and resorts to buying an artificially intelligent operating system (OS for short). Theodore gives his OS a female identity, whom introduces herself as 'Samantha' (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) upon booting up.It doesn't take long for Theodore to realize that Samantha has an uncanny ability to learn, grow, and analyze things like a real human being. Not only can she sort, clean, and upload the files on your hard-drive, but she can communicate one-on-one with Theodore and gives him not just a friend but a lovely romance between man and machine. She even has the unthinkable capability of analyzing feelings and present-emotions, making her almost all-knowing. The only thing she's missing is a body.Jonze's depiction of this romance could've been condescending; one that beats up its lead actor and portrays his vulnerability as a basic punchline. Instead, Jonze's depiction is tender, often meditative, resulting in a deeply intimate and softly-orchestrated relationship. This is one type of relationship that naturally has difficultly gaining momentum just because of the inevitable limitations of a machine as a significant other. However, Jonze never seems to run out of ideas for conversations between Theodore and Samantha, resulting in a beautiful, conversational intimacy missing from many modern romances.Before I even saw Her, but was open about my excitement to see it, my retired neighbor offered me keener insight into its material. 'I feel the film promotes isolationism and continues with our decline in social involvement and shows how we're all becoming more in more introverted into ourselves and our technology and simply shunning the outside world.' This was a great observation and identifies the technological age-gap when it comes to examining films about technology. However, Jonze portrays the outside world in Her to be a bit of a mystery as well. Almost everyone can still have honest, open conversations, and everyone is still talking out in public. However, they all appear to have something else going on at the same time, whether they have their own OS and have an earpiece in their ear, are listening to music, or simply talking on a cell phone. The particular American society portrayed in Her seems to be our current society upgraded a few notches, with Jonze still infusing the ideas of technological alienation with optimism for the future of face-to-face conversation and personal interactions. I hope to hell he's correct.Her, from a deeper, thematic standpoint, can mean quite a bit, depending on how you want to look at it. It's the kind of film where, I feel, the more I think about it, the more I'll have to say about it. As of now, I see Samantha as someone/something that gave Theodore the qualities of a human relationship with the human, while simultaneously making him appreciate the qualities humans possess. By the end, we see Theodore has an appreciation and a deeper recognition for two things, which I will not dare name here. Combining its themes with a practical visual scheme that makes the future look just plausible enough rather than overly-glossy and unrealistic, the film is a mental and visual stimulation in the proper form.On a final-note, one thing I hope is that while the extensive amount of themes, the content at hand, and the questions Her raises for the future need to be discussed and analyzed, Joaquin Phoenix's performance here should not be shortchanged. From what I have seen, this may indeed be Phoenix's strongest work, maybe even better than his embodiment of Johnny Cash in Walk the Line. Phoenix hits every note of Theodore Twombly's lonely, introverted character with stunning effectiveness and nuance, mainly the way Theodore's gentle mannerisms articulate his character's traits perfectly. Even Scarlett Johansson, whom exists simply as a voice, has the ability to woo and excite, despite her characters' obvious limitations. But the two together and it's a match made partially in reality and coding.I'm hoping Her will be a trendsetting film in the regard that its material will inspire more and more films showing relationships with technology or technological innovations. We've gotten quite a few in recent times, one of my favorites being Joe Swanberg's LOL, which focused on numerous relationships being set in motion and carried out almost entirely through the boundaries of cell phones, chatrooms, and webcam shows. But Her is much different, much more involved, and much more taken with creating this pragmatic dystopian world that, ten years ago, would've seemed so far-fetched it would've been laughed out of the theater.",10,1,4,11 January 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," Brings light to a drab and gloomy year
","The year 2008 was a very bland year for films. It was a year of mediocre comedies, some fair dramas, and mixed bags all around. Great films were few and far between, and one of the biggest recessions in American history was beginning to take effect. Yes, 2008 was a dark, gloomy year, but in the pile of so-so films, emerged a surprisingly involving coming of age story that was equal parts Bollywood (despite being released by a British company) and equal parts its own American/Indian hybrid. That, of course, is the Best Picture winner Slumdog Millionaire.At the time of its release, this was likely to be the first Indian film American audiences were exposed to. It was mine, definitely, but not my first foreign film. I try and make an effort to watch not only mainstream films, but some of the lesser known pictures every year not only to showcase variety, but to inform readers that there is a world of film that doesn't involve million dollar ad campaigns and monotony. Independent/foreign films are becoming increasingly popular, and thanks to a wise decision from the Academy, Slumdog went onto get wide recognition and is honored and celebrated for the real gem it is.It follows Jamal Malik, played by a real find of a teenager, Dev Patel, a young orphan, now sixteen, who grew up in the slums of Mumbai. He was an imposter and a thief for most of his life, and had to do things he isn't proud of, but managed to pick up life lessons and impeccable knowledge despite grand limitations. He is a contestant on the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, where he is one question away from winning Rs. 20 million when the horn sounds, meaning he will have to wait until the following day to finish his run.Following the episode, he is arrested under suspicion of cheating, tortured and manipulated until forced to confessed. The film then evolves into a sort of nonlinear story of Jamal going through each of the questions he was asked and discussed what life event he had to endure for him to know the answer, proving that he is really intelligent, not a cheater.One thing struck me watching the film, something I believe very few will pick up. It must be insanely insulting to go through life a street child, having no mother or father to look up to, roaming the streets of the slums every night, searching for a place to sleep, garnering intelligence and knowledge along the way, only to go on a popular game show to be arrested under suspicion of fraud. As if you're not good enough or believable in your own roots. When you're arrested for being smart and knowledgeable, what does that say about the way the world thinks of you? Nowadays, coming of age stories about unfortunate misfits, mainstream or independent, are a dime a dozen, so it's wonderful to see attempts at breeding creativity, innovation, and intellect to a genre searching for new direction are being made. Danny Boyle's slick directing and Simon Beaufoy's intelligent writing avoid corniness and heavy-handedness by constantly moving the story in a fast-paced and entertaining way. Beaufoy and Boyle would later reunite to work on the claustrophobic thriller 127 Hours I would come to dub 'a masterpiece on film.' It's next to impossible to compare the two works, since one's goal is to evoke the same sort of fear endured by a victim, while the others' is to prevent fear and inferiority from bringing down ones' feeling of self-worth.A friend told me going into Slumdog that despite the film being very good and a nice nod to Indian cinema, it is a rather cliché story. It is, when contemplated. There's a bit of a contrived love story between Jamal and the ravishing Latika, played by Freida Pinto. Sometimes, I sort of wished that was left out. At other times, I am glad the film incorporated it. Call it perplexing, but I prefer to dub it critical indecisiveness. It depends on which angle you're viewing the subplot from. You can either see it as a fair, plausible addition to Jamal's checkered life, or as an Indian movie desperately trying to fit in by playing dress up in American clothes.Slumdog Millionaire, despite all the mixed views, hype, and questions, is a wonderful character study, set in places rarely explored. My favorite scene is during the end credits, involving a massive and well-choreographed dance scene to the infectious anthem 'Jai Ho' by A.R. Rahman. I knew the tune long before seeing the actual film, and was amused like a young child when I finally saw the dance that concludes the film. Tell me again; how did the film bag the Best Picture award, but not Best Original Song? Starring: Dev Patel, Freida Pinto, and Mahesh Manjrekar. Directed by: Danny Boyle.",9,0,3,28 March 2012
Mad Max: Fury Road," What a lovely revival
","After allowing it to lie dormant for nearly three decades, George Miller reboots his beloved 'Mad Max' franchise in a manner that, I believe, very few saw coming. While it's the season for raucous, summer blockbusters that require little thought and provide for passing entertainment, 'Mad Max: Fury Road' changes course for the series and the idea of a blockbuster. This is an exhilarating, but uncommonly brutal, display of some of cinema's most kinetic and coherent actions sequences of the last decade, sewn together with everything from grotesque characters and characters that tread the line of being impressionistic.For the first time, the titular character isn't played by Mel Gibson, but instead, Tom Hardy, who provides a large amount of subtlety. In addition, I'd say that he also has about two full pages worth of dialog in a one-hundred and twenty minute film. He is less a character and more a brushstroke representation of an action hero, even moreso than in the last three films. Taking place, yet again, in a distant future where societal order has collapsed, Max is kidnapped early in the film by a gang known as the War Boys, led by the ruthless King Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), to be used as a blood donor. Meanwhile, a woman known as Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), who was assigned to use an enormous, armored truck to collect gasoline, the most sought after commodity in the community, is driving off course with all five of King Joe's wives, all of whom meant for breeding. Max winds up escaping and hitching a ride with Furiosa, resulting in a long chase throughout the entire desert.There is a simple moral of personal redemption in 'Mad Max: Fury Road,' and it's a moral that keeps the film from being entirely empty. However, it's not tacked on or exploited in a way that feels heavy-handed. This is one of the many tricky dances 'Fury Road' manages to pull off and do so very well. It's also a film of details, with screenwriters Miller, Brendan McCarthy, and Nico Lathouris essentially playing around on the large, spacious canvas of the desert, seeing where they can go and what they can do in order to create a film entirely focused on creating tension and breakneck action. Consider little inclusions like a deformed character who rides on an enormous truck, shredding on an electric guitar with dozens of loud speakers behind him. It doesn't add much to the story, but it provides for some incredible sounds throughout the whole film.The film also bears the best cinematography and visual effects so far this year. The desert has scarcely looked more attractive in all its sun-soaked glory, and cinematographer John Seale gets some of the best, most vivid shots of it throughout the entire film. Consider the scene when Furiosa collapses to her knees in the desert, as the sand and the sun are shown as limitless representations of time and space and stray sand grains softly glide on top of more compact sand, effectively creating what looks like a mirage. Or even consider the longshots that show the intense scenes of the War Boys catching up to Furiosa's truck. All of these beautiful inclusions and more are thanks to an extraordinarily talented visual effects and cinematography team.Finally, we have the action, which makes up about ninety-five minutes of the entire film, and for the first time, I'm not complaining. For one, the action in the film is captured clearly and vividly. Miller never loses us in the camaraderie; everything is so visually pristine and clear that there's never a lost sense of suspense because the camera-work is shoddy or the editing failed to do the scene justice. Editor Margaret Sixel really shows her talents in the beginning of the film, a briskly paced opening sequence involving Max, who is haunted by past memories, desperately trying to outrun the War Boys whilst being burdened by visions of his past encounters. These kinds of scenes are haunting, and add a layer to what would otherwise be standard situations in action films. However, the action is captured so crisply that it's impossible to ignore the sheer magnitude of talent on display here.For me, 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is an early candidate for the most surprising film of the year and favorite summer blockbuster. This is a film that pulsates with life and energy, taking one exhilarating, cacophonous circumstance after another and bathing it in road rage, gasoline, and unbridled chaos. Its immaculate portrayal of madness almost works to call out other big-budget films that have skimped on their own visual clarity, proving great results can be achieved if time is taken to do such great work. It appears that during his time away from the franchise, Miller reflected on where he wanted to take it, and what results is a fully realized film that struts with confidence and swagger. The film proves a lot of things about action films, but most importantly, also proves you can have a franchise lie dormant for years and, if seriously handled and given to the original creator, there is still potential for a spectacular comeback.",9,6,16,17 May 2015
The Breakfast Club," Want Some Strange to Go With That?
","We all know school could either be a time of fun or pure hell. IT's especially hell if you're a victim of a stereotype which what all five of these kids are by their nicknames listed above. The only thing all five have in common is that they share a room for an entire Saturday because of some bad thing they did. It's eight hours with people that go to the same school, but simultaneously are completely different because of their social standing in school. But they come out with a life changing experience. Its absolutely a feel good movie and a movie that no one can hate.It's Saturday March 24, 1984 at Shermer High School in Shermer, IL which is where five teens need to spend their entire day. Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez), Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald), John Bender (Judd Nelson), Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall), and Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy) are the victims and although go to the same school, they are all from different cliques or groups in the school. They are secluded in the school library from 7:00 AM to 4:00 PM, they can't talk, they can only sit and think about what they've done, and write their 1,000 word essay. They are occasionally visited by Principal Vernon (Paul Gleason). Though when he isn't in the room, they do the exact opposite of what they are supposed to.As time passes the kids learn about one another and know they each have a struggle to overcome and they need to rise above their stereotype. By looking at these kids you can tell who is who. Stereotypes have been around forever and though most are true can be hurtful and humorous. This film focuses and says to look past your stereotype and be who you can be. Let people see you as they want to see you. In my opinion the most deepest and heartfelt John Hughes film to date.Some kids my age would think it's a boring, lackluster film that isn't funny. I find it extremely fun and it only gets funnier every time you watch it. The movie is more than half dialogue which is why kids would be bored by it. But what else is there to do in detention on a Saturday? A kids moral to the film is be yourself, look past your bad quality, pick out the positives, and be who you are. A teacher's moral should be when you place five high school students in a room and expect them to keep quiet for eight hours, they will talk eventually.Starring: Emilio Estevez, Molly Ringwald, Judd Nelson, Anthony Michael Hall, Ally Sheedy, and Paul Gleason.

Gladiator," The olde style before substance
","Ridley Scott's Gladiator is a film that is acted and directed very well, but is an eyesore to look at for two and a half hours. The film's effects are nice, which got the film an Oscar in 2000, and so are the costumes, but they are all captured in a dirty, muddy tone. Most of the film is a dingy colored brown, appearing as if someone imbedded dirty in the camera lens.The film's plot is just a revenge story, soaked within a period piece. It involves General Maximus Decimus Meridius (Crowe), the leader of the Roman Army in AD 180. Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Harris) is very pleased with his latest victory, and grants him leadership, much to the dismay of the Emperor's son, Commodus (Phoenix). It isn't long before Commodus is consumed with rage, and murders his father, claiming the throne as his.Commodus puts out an order to the Praetorian men to kill Maximus's wife and son. Before Maximus can return in time to stop them, they are killed. Being in a functioning state of depression, and after being kidnapped by slaves who teach him how to fight, Maximus finds out he has a knack for fighting and slaying people. So the plot is born. Maximus is a great gladiator, and continues to fight and murder, leading up to his appearance at the Roman Colosseum.I've established that the film is long, which it is, but it is also fairly impotent. It's slow, a bit dreary, yet well written in the sense that decent dialog is always recited. After a while, though, you begin to grow weary of the film's hushed tone, and about five battle scenes later, the material begins to overstay its welcome.The film is slowly paced, but it definitely has a grand appeal. Crowe's performance is fantastic, and he brings life to a new action hero. For the brief time we see him, Richard Harris does a fantastic Emperor, and Joaquin Phoenix does an outstanding job playing a despicable, intolerable villain.I also stated that the film's costumes are nice, which they are, but after two hours they become sort of a chore to stare at. Some nice CGI is used, some scenes made up entirely of it, yet again, everything looks the same. Everything is mostly brown, green, and black, and very monotonous and harmful on the eyes.Not to mention, no characters are really developed at all. The film is two and a half hours, and neglects to give us very many personal traits of the characters. This is the perfect case of style over substance; a movie trait I've run into far too much recently. To value style over substance is to put looks in front of every other concern, rather than efficiency and depth. John Logan, one of the three writers of this film, would give us so many character traits of Howard Hughes in The Aviator, four years later. It's a shame that wasn't put in the foreground rather than a loud score and heavy action sequences with this.Gladiator isn't perfect, but it's a fairly memorable action flick, with some ups and downs. To me, this seems like a long B movie, with marvelous special effects and well known actors. It's just a shame that in two and a half hours we have to listen to decent, yet sometimes, redundant dialog, trait-less characters, and stare into a vast field of brown. At least we get Oscar worthy performances to watch for the most part.Starring: Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, Derek Jacobi, Djimon Hounsou, Ralf Möller, and Richard Harris.

Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Load, aim, shoot, crash, boom, explosion, repeat
","Transformers: Dark of the Moon is loud, lucrative, cloying, and an ongoing headache of a film. Its structure consists of mindless action scenes with hundreds of explosions, stiff characters, and a neverending amount of screaming. It's easily one of the worst action films to come out of Hollywood in recent memory, and the worst Michael Bay film to come out in about a year.The story is convoluted and just a mess. In simple terms - the Autobots and the Decepticons are at war again, and for some reason, they decide to fight on Michigan Avenue and Wacker Drive in Chicago.Shia LeBeouf is back playing Sam, who is still as idiotic and as loud as ever. Only this time, he has a new accomplice named Carly (Whiteley) who takes Megan Fox's place in the film. Together her and Sam face numerous explosions and somehow survive everyone of them. Because, you know, every girl sticks by some charming nerd who has a relationship with giant metal monstrosities. Not to mention remaining optimistic while they watch in awe as the robots turn Chicago into what appears to be the depths of hell.When people say they love the Transformers films I can't help but laugh, then correct them. They don't love the film. They love the explosions, the special effects, and the constant, mind-numbing action on screen. If these action sequences were cut up and put on the internet in little spurts and dubbed something totally different it would be the web series every twelve year old would be talking about. So, before you say you love Transformers: Dark of the Moon, stop and think - do you like the film or the special effects within the film? I bring this up because while Transformers: Dark of the Moon lacks a lot of hefty material that is required to make a good film, it completely shows the carelessness and idiocy of making a modern day action piece. Look at any good action film - Death Race 2000, Dirty Harry, Easy Rider, The Rookie, Speed, etc. What makes them all good besides their iconic leads? Character development, dialog, and worthy special effects that make up well crafted action scenes. Transformers, and I'm saying this to represent the entire franchise, lacks all but one of the categories.No matter how great the pyrotechnics, the explosions, or some of the scenes are, it gets incredibly aggravating to see pretty much the same thing for the course of two and a half hours. Not only is this just an incoherent mess, it's a mess that occupies so much more time than it needs to. It would be different if there was some narrative consistency rather than just explosion after explosion with a pounding, pretentious score playing at all times. If it followed a simple story, and worked from the ground up rather than settling for such a lazy style of film-making, the series might actually be more than just 'dumb fun.' One thing I could never wrap my brain around were the physics. I understand the whole genre is based off of someone's creative idea. In a cartoon, the idea of cars turning into a full-blown mechanical robot destroying everything in their paths is not only unique, but perfectly acceptable. For a cartoon of course. In a live action film, the idea is simply way too plausible to be accepted. The fun thing about cartoons is you know they could never happen. Having a live-action film made about the franchise, let alone three, just flat out ruins the point of Transformers overall - it could simply never happen.Certain scenes baffle me. For one - how can a robot jump, climb, wrestle, destroy, and blow up the same building and not having it collapse? How can another robot run on the side of a building without going straight through it or making it tilt? Also - how can Sam attach a grappling hook to a robot's eye while proceeding to be flung around like a piece of meat, crashing into concrete garages and buildings? With one hand only. Questions like these don't really get any other answer aside from 'just because.' Director Michael Bay has spent most of his directing years to making and producing horrible remarks and lackluster franchise re-imaginings. Transformers: Dark of the Moon is the poster child for why he shouldn't be in film, and why action films are quickly spiraling down to an all time low. The problem with Bay is he isn't creative or willing to pursue his own personal idea. The problem with this is the fact it suffers from no straight forward narrative, and relies on drawn out, cliché action scenes that, while well-crafted, go on for way too long of a time span.The final battle in Chicago, literally, is over an hour long. And it ends in the same cliché one would expect. If the battle was an hour long, and we were provided with a twist or something new I could see the reason for making it a certain length. But when you make us walk a long road to get somewhere and we get something we've seen before it just makes the whole trip useless and contrived.The moral of the story with Transformers: Dark of the Moon can be summed up, unlike the film itself, simply and effectively; quality over quantity.Starring: Shia LeBeouf, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Patrick Dempsey, and John Malkovich. Directed by: Michael Bay.",2,4,9,14 October 2011
Born on the Fourth of July," A lesson on dissent and war
","The Vietnam War was a war that was more trouble than it was worth, unfairly escalated, selfishly executed, and with little left to show for it on the American-side except for a countless number of mentally-ill veterans and a horrendously high body-count. I've made it a priority to thank veterans for their service when I see them in uniform out in public, but I've made it a special one to recognize the Vietnam vets. Regardless of my feelings on the war, I can't shortchange the bravery and the blatant disrespect the men in battle experienced when returning to their homelands. They were the enemy down there and they were the enemy back home. For a lack of a better term they were homeless.Oliver Stone's Born on the Fourth of July is a film that details their struggle better than any film I have yet to see. I can't speak from experience - and for that I'm thankful - but after reading autobiographies and recounts from the war, this seems like the film that got it right in terms of having you see the emotion and the energy bursting from the seems of the celluloid.It stars Tom Cruise as Ron Kovic, a selfless man from New York, who decides join the Marines and fight for his country in the Vietnam War. 'Love it or leave it,' he tells war protesters. He is the archetypal nationalist, against any and all forms of outspoken dissent about the country and its legislation or system. When he is drafted into Vietnam, he embraces the thrill and excitement of the war and the violence, until he becomes disoriented one day and accidentally shoots a new platoon member. This scars Kovic mentally, until he is badly wounded in battle, paralyzing him from the waist down; that scars him physically.He returns home paralyzed and in the confines of a wheelchair, still disillusioned about the Vietnam War. The film than calmly follows his descent into madness, growing shaggier in look and mood day-by-day. He lumbers around aimlessly, frequenting strip clubs and brothels, becoming more aggressive with family and friends, and deeply resenting methods of protest. That is, until his brother, who has become staunchly anti-war in his absence, tells him to look at what the war did to him. Kovic has now become paralyzed, irreversibly scarred mentally and physically, and later loosens grip on his heavily patriotic stance towards America.The saddening part is this is not just a true story (the film was based off the book Born on the Fourth of July by Ron Kovic) but likely a true story for many other veterans whose act of courage turned into a scarring, horrifying albatross on their life. Stone co-wrote the film with Kovic, leaving the impression that much, if not all, of what is in the film is true to the story of Kovic himself. This leads to just more sorrow on the viewer's part.What I find surprising is how well Kovic's descent is portrayed onto film; with more inclusions of quiet ballads and long-shots of scenery this could pass for a seriously great independent film. However, with Stone behind the camera, the story is given a more grandiose feel, which is perfectly fine with me. Stone has been known to man the camera on political epics that many find themselves loving or despising. Perhaps this is because Stone's films clearly communicate some sort of bias, politically and emotionally. They want you to feel everything as it is meant to be felt and they want you to embrace the political ideology of the time.This fact shouldn't be a big issue because, I believe, even the most heartened Vietnam War supporter can agree that Kovic's case is an extremely depressing one. Born on the Fourth of July details the loss of faith, hope, and trust in his government, and the final sequences featuring Kovic protesting the war are truly remarkable in their portrayal. Saying Kovic 'woke up to the reality of an issue' is a bit mean and condescending. In retrospect, his idea of blindly reading the headlines disintegrated when he finally go out in the battlefield and saw the hellishness that was war.One of the strongest things the film does is detail social change as well. Prior to the Vietnam War, it was the ultimate social-sin to criticize the country in any way, regardless of how wrong you thought we were. Even now, you can see the fire in someone's eyes if they are an enormous patriot and America is criticized politically or socially. One thing the Vietnam War did was stretch the boundaries of democracy; why were the war-protesters such bad people in the first place? Because they had a differing opinion than the norm? If anything, they were testing how far the ideas of democracy could stretch. Not all of their acts were justified, but it's safe to say that their impact and subversive qualities should not be diminished entirely just because they held an opinion contrary to your own.Stone's Born on the Fourth of July is something of a wake-up call. Even though the war is long over, thousands still suffer and thousands haven't began to receive the recognition they deserve. The film is uncompromising in its portrayal of borderline lunacy and the fighting and arguing about differing outlooks and views is nothing short of compelling and honest. It's a biopic, in some regard, that no one wants to claim, but it belongs to one man and countless others.Starring: Tom Cruise, Kyra Sedgwick, Raymond J. Barry, Jerry Levine, Frank Whaley, and Willem Dafoe. Directed by: Oliver Stone.",9,0,2,4 June 2013
The Social Network," A True Story of Consumption and Betrayal
","The Social Network has a quality in movies that isn't utilized enough. It captures the feeling of 'living it while watching it'. After I watched The Social Network I felt I had lived the frustration, hardships, and everything in between dealt with by the film's protagonist Mark Zuckerberg. Few movies have that unique quality and since many movies that are released now are poor, rushed, CGI messes, The Social Network proves good films still exist out there.Jesse Eisenberg is one of the many actors in the world today that is underrated, yet hasn't done a bad movie. He was funny and relatable in Zombieland, quirky yet lovable in Adventureland, and now he is smart and sophisticated playing quite possibly the biggest role in his filmography. His portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg is pure gold and almost Oscar worthy showing off how capable he is of a highly potential filled role. He shows off some clever one-liners in the film and even brings his full acting talents together by showing off technical humor in the film as well.The plot takes place in Harvard University in 2003 when Mark Zuckerberg's (Eisenberg) severe frustration after his breakup with his girlfriend leads him to posting several hate comments on his LiveJournal account. Mark then hacks into various servers making 'Face Mash' a site where people can rate the attraction of different women. Zuckerberg faces charges after the hacking which leads Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss (both played by Armie Hammer), and Divya Narendra (Max Minghella) to approach him and ask him if he would like to help them create a social networking site called 'ConnectU'.Zuckerberg accepts the offer, but then goes to his friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) with a similar idea about creating a site where friends can post status updates, pictures, talk to other friends, view other friends updates, and so on calling it 'The Facebook'. Mark and Eduardo spend a weekend working on the the idea and eventually launch it calling it 'The Facebook' like planned. The Winklevoss twins are furious claiming Zuckerberg had stolen their idea for the website and are now suing him for breaking his word.The film flashes back and forth from 2003 where Facebook started to when the lawsuit coincides with the part in the story. Its a unique action, the problem is it makes the film choppy. My only complaint is I could see where the crew was going trying to go back and forth between the birth/lawsuit. Though it makes the film choppy and almost slows things down. The Social Network runs for two hours when it could be cut back at least twenty minutes. Although the choppiness doesn't deteriorate much from the premise of overall idea of the film.I like this movie for many things, mainly the script written perfectly by Aaron Sorkin which is one of the many things Oscar worthy about this film. Not only does the screenplay satisfy to various degrees having heavy technical jargon and amazing dialog scenes, it's director David Fincher does an amazing job holding the movie together and the effort amounts in this film are overall amazing. Jesse Eisenberg, like stated before, deserves an Oscar for his profound performance in this film. He is Mark Zuckerberg. His looks, attitude, and characteristics show he perfectly capable playing a big name role.The movie teaches life lessons too. We see Napster's Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake, who gives a dynamite performance as well) walk into the picture to assist Zuckerberg with his Facebook site and basically kicks Saverin out of the picture. It shows that you need to keep your friends close. Anyone can waltz in and take control of your life if you let them. Don't put your friends aside for someone who loves your net worth more than the actual person. Here's the story of two friends who's website creation split their lives apart from each other because of Zuckerberg's selfish move. Rarely does a movie send a message so meaningful.The Social Network is now my pick for best film of the year followed by Toy Story 3, then Easy A. The Social Network could have easily been a poor, lifeless retelling of the founding of one of the biggest social networking sites nowadays, but it chose to be as good as it did. While running long, it still manages to tell the story and events in broad, descriptive detail leaving no stone unturned. Most of the movie's characters don't appear as the real thing at the same time the story not being all the way true, you will get that with every movie 'based on true events', The Social Network may anger Mark Zuckerberg, but it's still an informative, electric, dark, out of the ordinary, mesmerizing film with little to complain about. Fincher, Eisenberg, Sorkin, and everyone involved with the film have a perfect movie on their hands. One with a heart and soul.Starring: Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Justin Timberlake, Brenda Song, Rooney Mara, Armie Hammer, and Max Minghella. Directed by: David Fincher.",10,3,7,2 October 2010
The Wedding Singer," Take the mic and shove it
","The Wedding Singer opens with a pretty damn-good cover of 'You Spin Me Right Round' by Dead or Alive by Adam Sandler and company, which provided me with optimism that this would be a more controlled Sandler affair with more intelligently written humor and some solid drama between characters. Certainly The Wedding Singer doesn't show Adam Sandler at his most manic and uncontrollable, but during some instances, you can see writer Tim Herlihy is fighting his urges. Consider the morosely unfunny scene where, upon being dumped by his fiancé, the titular character (Sandler) lumbers through a performance at a wedding spewing unconscionable bouts of hatred and mean-spirited anger. But it's funny, right? Not in my eyes. The Wedding Singer, in my eyes, is another Sandler disaster. A film with a two-faced protagonist, a caricature of a love-interest, a terribly trite and predictable plot, and humor as reliable as a twenty-year old with well over 100,000 miles on it. The film isn't offensive in the casual sense, but in the deeper, more depressing sense that while senseless drivel like this is getting made, real writers and determined screenwriters getting turned away from the higher-ups because their material is too ambitious or too risky.It's 1985 and Adam Sandler stars as Robbie Hart, a popular choice for a wedding singer in Connecticut. Robbie is engaged to his girlfriend Linda (Angela Featherstone), but finds himself alone on his wedding day. However, while on the job, Robbie meets Julia (Drew Barrymore), a waitress who works many of the same venues where Robbie performs. Unfortunately, now that Robbie is single and recognizes that Julia may indeed make a great girlfriend, she is engaged to cocky businessman Glenn Gulia (Matthew Glave). So Robbie gets sidelined to help Julia plan the wedding when deep down he knows he should be her husband.Immediately, this film houses clichés I'm tiring greatly of. The first is the dimwit that we're supposed to like and sympathize with despite the stupid actions he commits consistently (usually a cliché in a Sandler film). The second is where the guy finds the perfect soul almost instantaneously after breaking it off with his girlfriend. Others include the expected fact that the dreamgirl is dating an unbecoming jerk, despite the guy's obnoxiousness the girl is obviously above, she still sees him as a mature and respectable guy, and the ridiculous ending we need to live with at the end of the film where everything is nicely patched up and elegantly concluded.Clichés work against a film, most definitely, but it also doesn't help in any particular saving grace-fashion when a comedy's wit is just at the near bottom of the barrel. Take for example the elderly woman Robbie can be seen assisting often over the course of the film. In the beginning of the film, upon first seeing her, we are, I guess, supposed to laugh because she is not your typical elderly lady with her quick wit and her efforts to fill Robbie's hands with meatballs and demanding he eat them then and there. But later on, Robbie has a discussion with her about his relationships where she can welcome in such fascinating commentary on Robbie perhaps being self-conscious about the size of his private area or other points that don't need to be brought up. The fatal kicker for the jokes with the elderly woman is what she says isn't funny but the fact that she's very old and saying such things is the humor of the situation.Barrymore and Sandler do have evident chemistry, especially during the drama of the later sequences, but it's very much undermined thanks to the film's middle-school attitude throughout the entire course of the film. The Wedding Singer, according to audience opinion, ranks among the higher margin of Sandler films, but I see nothing but the same unfunny schlock in smaller, more manageable piles. That's like saying a relatively messy park is more fun to play in than a filthier park when, frankly, I'd be keen on just staying home.Starring: Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore, Angela Featherstone, Matthew Glave, Allen Covert, and Peter Dante.

The Pursuit of Happyness," Tugs at the moral heart strings as if it has immediate access
","Once in a while, a film will subtly waltz by and sweep you off your feet leaving you with a keen sense of assurance and hope. The Pursuit of Happiness manages to do all that without seeming indulgent or heavy-handed. The film is based off of Christopher Gardner's memoir of the same name, about a stressed father who overcomes the largest of obstacles in order to provide him and his son with the life they have always wanted.Will Smith plays Gardner, a confident, everyman who has invested his family's savings into bone-density scanners that give a picture slightly deeper than an x-ray and cost twice as much. They are defined as 'unnecessary luxuries,' and many hospitals have turned down Gardner's offer, much to his dismay. Gardner's long-suffering wife, who finally walks out on him, is played by Thandie Newton. Newton's character is aggravated at his overpowering idea that 'things will get better,' and wishes he'd live in the moment and admit the chips are down. Their son, Christopher Gardner Jr., is played by Smith's son Jaden Smith, in his first film role. Smith shows signs of possessing a charismatic enigma, that few newcomer childhood actors can replicate. He is funny, sweet, and sometimes eerily passionate about his character at such a young age.The film follows Gardner's new job as an intern stockbroker, a job that is tiresome, involving, and utterly restless. The job can only be overcomplicated when you're looking for a place to eat and sleep every night, taking care of your plucky and adventurous kid, and fighting back at a society that has become arrogant, derogatory, and shamelessly cynical. This is perhaps Smith's most involved performance to date. It seems the only way Smith could play the character so well is if he had some sort of experience like Gardner's. It doesn't seem like you could just jump into the role of the man so effortlessly, but in order to efficiently pull it off, you would've had to go through some emotion-testing event in your life similar to his. I don't know why, but it just seems that way.Besides the performances being simply mesmerizing by everyone involved, the film has a good sense of honesty and realism to add substance to the story as well. Far too often are we faced with films that evoke happiness, or happiness in this case, as the thing that gets handed to us in a bright package. The Pursuit of Happiness works so well because it shows the true side of life. That we as humans might go through a number of failures before we achieve what we want, and even when we get what we want, might even still not avoid some failures. After Gardner gets the job as a stockbroker, he still goes through a lot of tribulations and aggravating circumstances in order to keep his new job. Sleeping in a homeless shelter with dozens of other strangers, having little to no money in his wallet, and knowing he can't provide for his son like other fathers are just some of the things that would drive an ambitious father up the wall. Perhaps his choices can be criticized, like letting his son sleep in a germ-infested bathroom, but his persistency must be commended.There is one scene in particular that is very moving and it is the scene where Gardner and Jr. experience 'time travel' in the subway station. The scene is so involving, simple, and effective. It's a scene that could've bled corniness and ridiculousness, but almost tugs at the heart strings. And that's what The Pursuit of Happiness does; tug at those moral heart strings not insultingly, but as if it has immediate access to them. And I think it's safe to say that many films know there's an easy entrance to those strings, but few choose to take that exact route.Starring: Will Smith, Jaden Smith, Thandie Newton, Brian Howe, and Dan Castellaneta.

Goodfellas," Keep it stacked or get whacked. Your choice.
","Scorsese's Goodfellas is an incorruptible masterpiece with morals, wit, black humor, and cringe-inducing material, some of which the most graphic and brutal the man himself has ever filmed. It portrays the life of organized crime over the course of three decades, showing the central character who grew up idolizing the mob before almost despising it towards the end of the film. The result is a slick, unmatchable look at the way mobsters spoke, operated, and functioned from the fifties to the eighties and is one of the most powerful pictures for not only Scorsese, but for film itself in general.The story revolves around Irish-Italian Henry Hill (Liotta) who, ever since he was a youngster, looked up to the mob in his home of New York City. He says he wanted to be a gangster more than the president, because the gangsters had an untold amount of respect and dignity. The job revolves around persistency, bravery, emotionless devotion where one bad choice could ruin every good one you ever made in your life.Hill is taken under the wing of mob boss Paulie Cicero (Sorvino) and his loyal team of Jimmy Conway (De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Pesci). Conway operates as sort of an everyman mobster who is constantly watching his back, yet at times seems like he will crumble under all the pressure. While Tommy, on the other hand, is animalistic, unapologetic, and simply shameless, reacting impulsively on violence if someone looks at him the wrong way. Pesci's role as Tommy DeVito earned him an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, quite possibly the most violent character to ever win. While Hill is working for Cicero at a young age he learns two of the most important life lessons early on in his career; 'Never rat on your friends, and always keep your mouth shut.' This begins Hill's long, relentless career as a mobster, which involves stealing, plotting, scheming, and constant commitment to the job. He gets married at a young age, to the heart-stopping beauty Karen (Bracco), a Jewish girl, much to the dismay of her mother. Karen falls for Hill's bravery, leadership, protection, and smarts early on, but realizes that once you married a mobster, you're now married to the job as well. That makes you a mob-wife; a position you can't refuse.Throughout the film, we see how Hill manages his mobster duties and his overall position. This is where the very Scorsese aspect comes into play. If you've been exposed to enough of the genius director, you'll know what he does best; the stories of people who rise and fall, or endured a reasonable amount of glory in a specific point in their life. In Casino, it showed a man named Sam 'Aces' Rothstein, played by De Niro as well, struggle to run a Vegas casino with a number of roadside distractions. He was at the height of his game once, but a few faulty decisions on his part ran him straight into the ground. In The Aviator, one of Scorsese's more recent films, we meet the unsung filmmaker and aviation expert Howard Hughes, portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio. There, we dissect Hughes' glory years from when he directed the most expensive film of all time, to when he plummeted into a sea of nothing, becoming a sheltered germaphobe for a good remainder of his life. In Goodfellas, we see how a man can go from being a big shot to a self-indulgent, paranoid man consumed alive by his own greed, disrespect, and betrayal.Another recurring element, in pretty much every film by Scorsese, is we can see Scorsese's undeniable fascination with the material. We understand why he took the project just by the way he shot the film. We can see he takes a stern liking to the mob lifestyle, and sometimes, we get the faint impression he admires them. On the surface, and if we were to make a broad generalization, untold riches, cute Italian women, different ones every night, close friends, and fancy clubs and restaurants sounds divine to me. But they don't tell you that you must sleep with one eye open, and constantly avoid getting whacked. That part they left out of the manual.The performances, like in any film by the master, are simply divine - not a single one off pitch or even average. One performance that has gone overlooked is Lorraine Bracco. She is in the same position actress Sharon Stone would find herself in when playing Ginger in Casino, five years later. Bracco is in the position to overact, but never does. She is constantly improving as time goes on, and handles her climatic instances well. Not to mention, the male performances by De Niro, Liotta, Pesci, and Sorvino are all absolutely wonderful, always hitting the correct note in every place.Goodfellas is an American classic. Not a modern classic; a regular ol' classic. It is an enriching movie, with stylish writing (by Scorsese himself and Nicolas Pileggi, who wrote the novel the film is based on, Wiseguy), inevitably stellar performances, and an unforgettable score and setting that might leave you breathless at some points. The hardest part in any Scorsese film is picking a favorite scene. I think I've found one. It involves one the best jump scenes in any film I've seen recently. Along with evoking regret, naive instincts, and betrayal. It involves Joe Pesci. I will not say more.Starring: Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Paul Sorvino, and Lorraine Bracco.

The Great Gatsby," A mystifying hit, old sport
","F. Scott Fitzgerald's timeless novel 'The Great Gatsby' is a wonderful piece of literature that dabs into many themes and events despite boasting a rather simple premise. Its commentary on the American Dream, its noted palette of colors, and array of ambiguous characters make it one of the most fascinating books I've read in high school. However, it's an understandably challenging read, seeing as the visual representation of the color and descriptions of the parties are left confined to the viewer's imagination, making something very important to the book abstract and personal.It comes as a small surprise that he who mans the camera in the film is director Baz Luhrmann, a longtime Hollywood-man known for showcasing incredible visuals and limitless set designs. Luhrmann's grandiose vision is perfect for a story of this magnitude. He provides us with the best film rendition of 'The Great Gatsby' I have yet to see, and one that perfectly compliments the style, tone, and thematic tendencies of the novel.The story is difficult to summarize to those who never read the novel. I question if those unaware of the book or its plot before the release of the film expressed interest solely by the trailers. The story concerns a group of wealthy socialites in 1920′s New York, with the central focus on Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire), a young, ambitious writer-turned-bond broker. In the middle of studying business, he is instantly taken by the way the areas of East Egg and West Egg interact and hangout and becomes immersed in the desirable lifestyle, reconnecting with his cousin Daisy (Carey Mulligan) and her husband Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton).He soon becomes aware of a man named Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio), an elusive figure largely concealed by his enormous parties that disguise his presence and true character. Many rumors exist about who he is and what he does, but the character is vacuous to everybody but Nick, who strikes up an early friendship with the man. Nick learns the justification for Gatsby's larger-than-life parties and mystifying ora is an overall attempt to get closer to Daisy. After being shipped off to war, he lost all contact and desperately craves her love and tenderness once more.Like most great works of literature, 'The Great Gatsby' can be seen as an embodiment of several themes and ideas. Most commonly associated are its symbolic representation of the American Dream, along with a romantic love channeling obsession and the idea that money can't buy or produce happiness. Writers Luhrmann and Craig Pearce beautifully articulate this in an accessible, yet versatile way. The film should not be viewed as a party movie, although the parties are extreme and excessive. Nick describes them as a 'kaleidoscopic carnival' and that is, by far, the best summation of the lavishness and vivacious qualities of a Gatsby party.The performances here are divine. Tobey Maguire and Leonardo DiCaprio are wonderful fits for their respective characters, each emphasizing their own particular qualities. Carey Mulligan of Steve McQueen's 'Shame' is, at times, mesmerizing here, Elizabeth Dibecki does some fine work here, in terms of creating a character out of small parts, and Joel Edgerton is terrific as the incorrigible brute that is Tom. The talent combined with the pulsating energy of Luhrmann's production and effects creates an indescribable allure.This is the second film by Luhrmann I have seen, with the first being his dismal 'Romeo + Juliet,' a film modernizing the iconic play by effectively creating a film for kids who don't like reading. With 'Gatsby,' he has left a lot more in tact with the original novel and doesn't make too big of an attempt to rewrite its devices with things from the new-age. If one can overlook the anachronistic music by Jay-Z and Florence + The Machine, which can blend awkwardly with the aesthetics of the Jazz Age/Roaring Twenties, this is still a faithful adaptation of the beloved book. It also helps if you overlook the use of phrase 'old sport' at the end of nearly every sentence Gatsby says.It's always intriguing to see a film based on a book many kids have read in school be adapted into a mainstream film. Detractors of it now become anxious to see it, and those who loathed it just because they were required to read and test on it in school flock to see it. For 'The Great Gatsby,' I think it helps that Luhrmann's distinctly flashy style and bombastic image took the foreground for the marketing of the picture. Thankfully, this isn't a hollow and superfluous adaptation with little below the surface. It's a visual spectacle and a delightful picture completely fit for the cinema.Starring: Tobey Maguire, Leonardo DiCaprio, Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton, and Elizabeth Dibecki.

13 Hours," For those who want the experience and not the baggage
","Perhaps Michael Bay was one of the better directors that could've handled an action film that depicted the hellish events that occurred in Benghazi on September 11, 2012, which resulted in the deaths of four men, including the United States Libyan Ambassador Christopher Stevens. Rather than bringing a politicized agenda or approaching this story by showing the closeted safety of government buildings where hasty conversations more than certainly took place, Bay thrusts himself on the frontlines with this picture, intent on documenting the chaotic, tragic, and horrifying events that occurred there and follow the men who often get left out of the conversation. No matter what side of the political spectrum you fall on, you almost can't disagree with the tragic circumstances that unfolded on that September day.With '13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi,' Bay and screenwriter Chuck Hogan focuses on the titular men who came to the U.S. embassy's rescue in Libya when the compound housing Christopher Stevens and numerous others came under attack by terrorists. The story centers around Jack Da Silva (John Krasinski, who gives a strong central performance in an unlikely role), a family man with a wife and two children, who finds himself sent into Benghazi with numerous familiar faces in order to protect the ambassador and assure security in the embassy. When Stevens' bullet-proof compound is swarmed by violent Libyans, any conceivable plan is lost and Da Silva and his squadmates are forced to act largely on impulse in order to live to see rescue from a distant airport, or at least the sunrise again.Hogan spends the first fifty minutes building up to the inevitable, showing the men arriving in Benghazi, hanging out with one another, in addition to Stevens arriving with other CIA members that would eventually come to meet their fate upon having their compound attacked. During this time, we see that both Bay and Hogan aren't really intent on setting up these soldiers as characters, nor are they very interested in any of their backstories save for Da Silva's and his disillusionment with not seeing his kids as frequently as he'd like. While this is undoubtedly a problem for a project that has these men in the subtle of the film, Bay and Hogan's intentions become more and more clear as the film progresses.By the time the compound is attacked and the soldiers flee to the embassy for protection and to protect it, it's clear that Bay and Hogan are interested in depicting the chaos and the unbelievably tragic circumstances that took place in Benghazi during these thirteen hours more than anything else. Rather than focusing on a politicized narrative, both men remain respectful to the titular soldiers in their depiction, but also the Libyan citizens. The film even ends on a fairly daring note to recognize the humanity of the other side, even the enemy, in multiple respects, before ultimately concluding on a note that is incredibly considerate and respectful of all involved.Bay's directorial gracefulness comes through in this film more than in any project I've yet to see from him, and that's likely because he's aware he's walking on eggshells. Turning the events of the Benghazi terrorist attack into an action film is already a very risky idea, and coupled with the fact that Bay is often cited as one of the worst directors working today certainly doesn't assist his credibility or his ambition any more. Instead of opting for his usual flash-in-the-pan, sound and light show combined with a mind-numbing amalgamation of sensory annihilation and noise pollution, Bay opts for an angle that showcases the violence of this attack with a strong sense of visual clarity.Make no mistake in judging '13 Hours' too quickly, however, for its repetition in showcasing the violence of the attack does have the ability to wear on the viewer. While Bay's approach is admirably constant and never uneven, the excessive violence becomes interchangeable, especially when there are no characters attached to the bodies that are just so haphazardly flying around and collapsing before our eyes.The jingoism from 'American Sniper' is absent, although the coldness and emphasis on amorality in a time of complete and total chaos from 'Fury' is missing, as well. '13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi,' as a result, stands in a class all its own in terms of being respectful and cognizant of its characters and the real-life individuals involved, though it can't help but fall prey to the weakest of war movie conventions. With all that being said, between this and 'Pain & Gain,' I, for one, can officially say I'm excited for the new projects Bay has been taking on and will hopefully continuing taking on in the future. This is the perfect film to complement a potential neo-Bay revolution.",6,10,34,15 January 2016
Warm Bodies," Nicholas Sparks this ain't
","When the zombie craze hit America, circa 2009, it seemed to have swept everyone up except for myself. What can I say, I guess zombies just aren't something I will make a totally conscious effort to watch. I've enjoyed several zombie movies in my day, including George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead and Ruben Fleischer's Zombieland, but have never watched a full minute of AMC's The Walking Dead. Perhaps I've just thrown all my zombie-credibility down the drain by revealing that.Nevertheless, I can hold an opinion on Johnathan Levine's Warm Bodies, a somewhat unique romantic-horror story centering on the romance between a beautiful living girl and an attractive dead boy. We open by seeing 'R' (Nicholas Hoult), a young zombie wandering around an airport after a fairly recent zombie apocalypse that has claimed a good portion of the country's citizens. 'R' can not speak coherently, holding conversations with passersby that rarely channel anything besides grunts and muffled groans. We get all his internal thoughts through open narration about how he can not remember his name, or how he became a zombie in the first place, and just wants to go back to being a normal human being.One day, 'R' and a group of other dead souls run into a group of perfectly undead ones and a shootout begins. 'R' winds up feasting on the brains of an innocent young male, and begins to get the man's memories flowing through his head. In them, he sees a beautiful, young, vibrant woman of golden blonde hair (his girlfriend), who just happens to be in the same room as this shootout is unfolding. She is Julie Grigio (Teresa Palmer), who 'R' looks not to harm, but to protect from the undead army of people invading the remainder of the country. He takes her to an airplane that will serve as their closeted sanctuary, where she will teach him the ways of a human, and he will assure she is protected and cared for properly. The only minor problem is that Julie's oppressive dad (John Malkovich) runs a violent human group that is hellbent on searching for zombies and slaying them on impact.Writer/director Levine, who, two years ago, made one of the most heartwarming comedy-dramas of 2011, 50/50, juggles two genres here that haven't had the best treatment in recent years. The horror genre, which is so dreadfully lifeless it mimics the onslaught of zombies brought forth in this picture, and the romantic comedy genre, which is usually just reduced to incredulity and emotional manipulation, are merged with somewhat satisfactory results, yet this leaves the tone of Warm Bodies jumping all over the place. One thing that remains consistent, however, is the slowburn technique that Levine employs early. The film takes a while to get from place to place, and rarely focuses on anyone either than Hoult and Palmer, leaving a lion's weight of dependability on their chemistry together. Their chemistry works and elevates the film to a respectful status, and is without hesitation, the best part about this film.The problem with the tone is the main distraction, though. Warm Bodies jumps into so many different genre pools that it only manages to pull them off fairly, without much notable charm. The genre that comes out with the most due payed to it is definitely the romantic one, and as one watches the inevitability unfold, it's nothing but blunt to the audience that this is trying to attract the tween audience and get them hooked on what aspires to be the next big thing. Comparisons to the Twilight series have already been made, but this is a far less melodramatic exercise than those films proved to be. Yet, while Warm Bodies may provide one of the love interests with a different twist, it still carries us down the path of contrivance and inevitability we can foresee before the halfway point.Had this been R-rated, no pun intended, the horror possibilities could've been further exploited and the story may have evolved into something more than tween-fare. Alas, this isn't how the idea came to fruition, and perhaps this tween direction would've been more profitable and well-received than the path I would've rather seen this story take. Everyone involved is capable, the inspiration drawn from Romeo and Juliet is apparent, and the idea of focusing on a zombie character for once is a good one, and it should satisfy those seeking out a different kind of romantic comedy that injects flavor, wit, style, and potency without bearing the name 'Nicholas Sparks.' But the girls who are 'creeped out' by zombies can comfortably standby for two weeks when Valentine's Day brings a film more up their alley.Starring: Nicholas Hault, Teresa Palmer, John Malkovich, and Rob Corddry.

The Birds," The reward is not worth the endurance test
","Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds would be a truly masterful exercise in slowburn tension if it had been about twenty-five minutes shorter. Even as a fan of slowburn horror, often relishing in the age-old ideas of buildup and surprise to accompany the shock and awe that horror brings audiences, I found myself exhausted and almost indifferent to the titular subjects of the film and whether or not they were ever going to show up or not. For about fifty-three minutes, we are given an uncompromising amount of development and methodical plotting centered around a series of bland and wealthy archetypes to finally get to the point where the birds invade that the entire film almost becomes a study to see how long the audience will sit still to see what they came to see.The film revolves around a young, pretty socialite named Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren), who meets a lawyer named Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) in her bird-shop in San Francisco one day. He buys a pair of lovebirds for his sister's birthday, but because the shop is fresh out of stock, Melanie will have to deliver them the next day. Upon arriving at his mother's home the next day, Mitch spots Melanie and invites her to dinner. While there, Melanie meets Mitch's mother Lydia (Jessica Tandy), his sister Cathy (Veronica Cartwright), and a school teacher named Annie Hayworth (Suzanne Pleshette). The five meet and dine inside a small beachhouse off of Bodega Bay when they see a plethora of birds, particularly seagulls, beginning to attack them and their home. When this unexpected, and certainly unexplainable, event occurs, the family decides to combat it the best they can by retaliating with whatever is in immediate reach.The Birds has become a quintessential American horror film, largely because of the reactions its director's name inspires. Hitchcock had a wonderful way with his films that made them transcend horror films into elegant, decorated melodramas that frequently made you jump. His films always ooze class in the way they are filmed and colored, showcasing details and making every inch of the screen count, as a result. Hitchcock could almost sleepwalk and make a film like The Birds look as good as it does, though for me, nothing beats the true amount of meticulous detail in actors and events occurring at once than in Rear Window.The issue is The Birds feels like a generic 1930s serial overstuffed to reach surpass a two-hour runtime. The amount of filler and fluff we have to sit through before getting to what we came for is unruly, especially considering most of it is staggeringly slow and numb conversation by actors that feel like even they, themselves, are bored and disinterested in the lines they're reciting. By the time they titular villains actually take the stage, the kind of conservative narrative practices Hitchcock employed are abandoned in favor of a great deal of shock and awe, having countless crows swarm the screen at once, never seeming to really pose any harm to the characters, as if they're on a whole other layer of film that has been placed over another layer that has the actors and the set decorations.The peculiar and cheap-looking mise-en-scene and the dreary pacing are somewhat disguised by Melanie and Mitch's retaliation efforts towards the end of the film. This is the point when Hitchcock trades the traditionalist elegance of a melodrama and the slow conversation for something more exciting and energetic. The intensity of the film suddenly shifts when we realize that the main characters aren't even safe from the birds in doors, as the winged creatures can come through the fireplace and easily swarm the home. The final twenty-five minutes of The Birds is satisfying and suspenseful, precisely what this film should've been all along.However, the price we have to pay - about an hour of dreary buildup and hit and miss effects - to gets about twenty to twenty-five minutes of great entertainment is almost not worth it. The classic status of The Birds, something few horror films really get to relish in when compared to other genres, is undeniable; the worthiness is questionable.Starring: Tippi Hedren, Rod Taylor, Jessica Tandy, Suzanne Pleshette, and Veronica Cartwright.

Jurassic Park," One of the five defining films centered on special effects
","Steven Spielberg's original Jurassic Park is one of the five films I can think of that really showed American audiences the capabilities of special effects and the sheer realism of such effects (Tron, Star Wars, Avatar, and Gravity are my other case examples). The film shows creatures, better yet, a world, that I'm sure most kids fantasized about exploring when they were young come to life in a way that balances the mystique, the adventure, and the peril all in one collective package. There's no need to give dinosaurs voices or two-dimensional personalities; seeing them come to life and enthrall is all that we needed.The story revolves around a company known as InGen, run by billionaire CEO John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), who decides to allow four individuals, in addition to his two grandchildren, into a theme park he has created, housing living dinosaurs. What unfolds, however, is a catastrophic miscalculation, with dinosaurs running amok and people's lives being put in danger. Dennis Nedry (the always likable Wayne Knight) is the park's architect and computer engineer, who works to make sure that all goes well with the park, despite the outcome.On top of being a love letter to our childhood dreams of being immersed in a world of real life dinosaurs, Jurassic Park really formulates what a summer blockbuster is - realistic special effects, a team of rather likable actors shuffled in the mix, and a grandiose platform on which to play. Jurassic Park's main asset, however, despite its beautiful effects, is the sense of danger it conjures up. Ultimately, while still exercising the principles of science-fiction, the film plays like a horror film at times with its suspense and buildup. Consider the scene when Hammond's grandchildren are hiding from a gigantic Tyrannosaurus Rex, as the dinosaur careens over where they sit, lurching over them like an engulfing shadow.The intensity Spielberg and company conjure up is akin to the kind of slowburn buildup Spielberg worked to predicate Poltergeist off of several years earlier. There's a liberal amount of time that allows for a setting to be created, characters to be introduced, and a sense of danger to build. After the first hour or so, the film goes from a rather calm and collective drama concerning the erection of Jurassic Park to a full-blown, high-octane adventure revolving around our wildest imagination.While Jurassic Park is a winning spectacle of special effects and danger, it still falls prey, however, to the typical pitfalls of being a summer blockbuster. As somewhat expected, character development is sparse, as the characters before us (with the exception of Knight's Nedry) speak with the kind of technical jargon that makes them less characters running a park and more vessels to advance the plot. Being that there's little in the way of development for these souls also means it's hard to truly feel anything for them when they're put in danger, the primary reason we should be so invested in the peril on screen. In addition, there is also a lack of the exploration of the 'man playing God' that is usually instilled in these films. Hammond has great potential to be the anti-hero here, working against popular opinion or science to develop real-life dinosaurs, ignoring all opinions and simply going for what he feels is right rather than what others see as morally right.But perhaps I'm turning Jurassic Park, a film firmly stitched into the fabric of American cinema, into something it was never meant to be. One of the biggest gripes I get as a film critic is the assertion that I can never take films at face value or pieces of entertainment. The entertainment provided in Jurassic Park is sufficient enough to warrant a recommendation, and the film has already transcended the impact of a summer blockbuster. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right, or maybe in the end, it's for the dinosaurs.Starring: Richard Attenborough, Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and Wayne Knight.

The Simpsons Movie," 'Do-oh'n't miss out
","Having not seen this movie since my second viewing in 2008, I thought for The August Rush pop this one in and see it again because my memory was foggy on this film. The Simpsons Movie is a lighthearted, fun movie that never bores and has something happening every second. Homer is surprised to find that a bunch of 'giant suckers' paid to see a movie like this when it will come on TV for free. The Simpsons have ran for currently twenty one seasons, producing over four hundred episodes and have a merchandise line as long as The Great Wall of China. With action figures, dolls, slippers, posters, apparel, an Xbox, DVDs, VHS tapes, Blu-Rays, and now a movie to go along with, The Simpsons are in good shape to a possible 30th season and maybe longer.The Simpsons is probably one of the only classic animated programs on TV anymore with others like South Park and Spongebob Squarepants. No show has ran for as long and has had so much publicity like The Simpsons. Not being the biggest fan of the show, but having seen various episodes and possessing knowledge of the show I knew I had to see this. I wasn't surprised a movie of the yellow family was made.The film is something that couldn't be cut down to a thirty minute show. Springfield Lake is already in trouble with pollution, but gets worse after Homer adopts a pig from Krusty Burger. To store the pig's droppings, he gets a big silo labeled 'Pig Crap'. Marge tells him to dispose of the pig's droppings and he does so by dropping the gigantic silo into the Springfield Lake causing mad pollution. Russ Cargill, the head of the EPA, talks it over with President Schwarzenegger and they choose (if you want to call it that) to put a gigantic dome over Springfield to contain it's severe pollution causing the whole town to erupt in anger to The Simpson Family and forcing them out of the town. The Simpsons find a way out of the town and are on the run away from the EPA.The film is cute and very energetic like its on its own medicine. Its a fine example of a TV show that has a good film adaptation. One down fall of the film is it's afraid to take risks. While earning a PG-13 rating, we only see three things (language, finger gestures, and nudity) that we would never see on FOX. South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut however took numerous jumps that Comedy Central would never allow. It still holds the record for most swear words in an animated movie (with 139 uses of 'the f word').If only The Simpsons Movie took more leaps and didn't have to shade their faces whenever they made a big step. The Simpsons have kept their near squeaky clean appearance on television for more than twenty years, they deserve a couple leaps. Not to say it was bad, just once in a while, everything needs to step up. Also, its a shame that some characters like Principal Skinner and Miss Crabapple didn't get bigger roles in the movie. Some character like them and Chief Wiggum I wish played a bigger part in this movie.Other than that, The Simpsons Movie is a highly enjoyable animated movie that shows after twenty years on the air, The Simpsons can still bring hard laughs and amusing one liners that are memorable. Seeing this film after a two year absence gave me a boatload of fresh laughs and a very funny plot. The Simpsons Movie isn't just a movie, its an enjoyable animated ride with the family we love.Voices of: Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, Harry Shearer, Albert Brooks, and Tress MacNeille.

The Martian," A low-key triumph on a massive budget
","Ridley Scott's new film 'The Martian' does not mess around with buildup or anything in the way of expository drama; it gets right to the point and recognizes why you came to see it. It opens with Ares III, NASA's manned mission to Mars, experiencing a treacherous storm upon arriving on the red planet. Debris is flying and visibility is next to nothing, and before the astronauts (Jessica Chastain, Michael Peña, and Kate Mara) can take off, fellow astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is struck by a flying antenna and presumed killed. The group takes off with the notion that Watney is dead.Following NASA head Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) making the announcement of Watney's death, we see that Watney is indeed very much alive on Mars, albeit slightly handicapped after being impaled in the stomach by the antenna. Watney now has to essentially operate on a field of landmines whilst acting as a scientist MacGyver to try and sustain life on Mars, a place where presumably nothing grows and anything can go wrong at any time. In addition to monitoring water reclamation, oxygen, and atmospheric levels, he winds up growing an array of potatoes with the help of the feces of him and his crew and makes a small home for himself. It will over four years for another manned mission to rescue him, but NASA headquarters, comprised of Sanders and assistants like Vincent (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Annie (Kristen Wiig), is determined to bring him back home in a timely fashion.Headquarters is also struggling with the idea of telling the surviving members of the Ares III mission that Watney is alive, which ignites a fiery ethical side to the film's story. With that, 'The Martian' is essentially a gigantic teamwork exercise where everyone feels human, which is a pleasant attribute for Scott, whose recent films have really lacked in the filmmaking craft and humanization elements. Scott's visual effects and grandscale directing usually never fail, but when these become the focus and human characters and the little touches (the science, the cause-and-effect relationships, and the narrative interest) become secondary or gravely shortchanged, then there's a real issue with his films on a macro level.'The Martian,' even with its nearly two and a half hour runtime, remains consistently interesting because it's a generally optimistic film, surprisingly enough. Watney is a wisecracker a lot of the time, even in the face of certain doom, and seeing NASA's constant efforts to bring him home show a certain diligence on their behalf works to make this film surprisingly hopeful. Then there's the roundtable of rich performances here; aside from Damon, who does solid work being the only actor on-screen in his scenes for his sheer honesty mixed with vulnerability, Daniels and Ejiofor work off of each other incredibly well together here.Consider the scene following Ares III's escape from Mars during the storm, when Watney is still presumed dead; the two consult one another about what to do with Watney's remains whilst subsequently trying to find a way to turn it into a more positive, caring PR display by sending another mission out to recover his corpse. This is a perfect scene in the way that it shows the way corporations and organizations balance humanity while considering their bottom-line, and who better to play figures in those pivotal positions of power than Daniels, who's work on 'The Newsroom' has gone on to be acclaimed, and Ejiofor, who, much like David Oyelowo, will likely win an Oscar in the next ten years.Aside from a reliance on montages instead of actual exposition, 'The Martian''s biggest problem as a film is the fact that we simply do not get enough time with Watney alone. The audience can never get a strong grasp on a relationship with this character simply because we're never allotted enough one-on-one time without the intrusion of mission control. We needed more scenes with Watney ostensibly helpless, trying to farm, or simply trying to get by on what little he has to surround himself and the film doesn't do that.'The Martian' also makes fairly strong use of its 3D elements, using it as a tool of immersion rather than a gimmick that works to add a surcharge to already high movie ticket prices. Consider the storm scene, which completely floods the screen with indiscernible debris and disarray; the scene is only emphasized with the benefit of 3D and makes the experience that much more horrifying, being that, like the characters, we can barely see a thing.Above all, this is a film destined to please a crowd; in addition, it also keeps its pathos down considerably, doesn't do a whole lot of pandering to a crowd anxious to see action, and never loses sight of its deeply human and remarkable story. It also reaffirms the value of logical problem-solving in the face of a truly unexpected, and granted unprecedented, time of tumultuous uncertainty. It's a low-key triumph made on a nine figure budget.",8,29,57,7 October 2015
The Fighter," A cast of champs
","The Fighter is one of those films that after you watch it you feel almost that you lived it. It has a quality very few films have. Some films like Diary of a Wimpy Kid and Sex and the City 2 make you feel like you're watching a poorly written film or are just staring at characters that you have no desire to watch. The Fighter has the right amount of intensity, realism (which it should), and a great cast to seal the deal.While I haven't seen The King's Speech, I can say Colin Firth has some hefty competition as he better win me over as Prince Albert. Because as of now, its looking like Wahlberg should've deserved it. My goal is to watch all the Best Picture nominees of The Oscars before June, my set deadline. Franco was good, Eisenberg was great, but Wahlberg is a character in this film.The plot: Welterweight boxer Mickey Ward (Wahlberg) struggles to make a name for himself as he tries to fight his way to fame. His big mouthed, former crackhead brother Dicky (Bale) is his trainer and his mother, played by the fabulous, well deserving Oscar winner Melissa Leo is his manager.Mickey is constantly babied and spoon-fed by his mother who feels that if someone isn't family they're not worth their time. Her personality comes forth when Mickey is offered to be trained in Vegas. Of course anyone would jump at the opportunity, but Mickey's uptight family (with the exception of his dad) refuses to let him.That is until Mickey meets a lovely young bartender named Charlene (Adams) who is Mickey's girlfriend. She encourages him to stand up for what he wants to do, only to be named 'an MTV girl' by Mickey's nine sisters.It's a thrill I got to see The Fighter for a low price on Xbox Live's Zune. It's something that is well worthy of the title 'a must see film.' The end was a tiny bit disappointing, but not everything is perfect. Everything has a flaw. I cheered a little for Mickey, but I felt that something else should've happened at the end. Like Raging Bull had a little bit of a 'wow' moment at the end. The Fighter doesn't have an ending that is truly shocking.Regardless, it doesn't drag the film down a whole lot. Wahlberg is fantastic, Bale is wonderful, Leo is powerful, just powerful, and Adams is one of the strongest female leads of 2010. She gets into her role as Charlene and just hits everything spot on. It seems after doing bad romantic comedies she finally hit the jackpot.Director David O. Russell's documents one of the most gripping fighting films in my recent memory, and ranks up with Scorsese's Raging Bull. The action on screen is great and The Fighter is an all around enjoyment.Starring: Mark Wahlberg, Christian Bale, Melissa Leo, and Amy Adams. Directed by: David O. Russell.",9,3,5,19 March 2011
High Fidelity," A trip inside the crowded contents of the male psyche
","Rob Gordon (John Cusack) is a man stuck in a rut and that rut is one that occupies childlike sensibilities, an inability to adapt to change, and a lack of understanding, or effort to understand, the women in his life. Rob has yet to really come of age and has been stagnant in his ability to mature and grow up, sticking to what he knows in the most primal sense. He runs a record store with his friends Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack Black), spending most of his days engaging in meaningless conversations about which musicians are better than other musicians, what records have a long-lasting impact over others, and so on, almost as if their musical elitism predated the kind you see in the same place where this film is set, Chicago.Rob has just gone through a breakup with Laura (Iben Hjejle), a woman he clearly cared about but had no idea how to act on his feelings in a way that pleased her in a significant manner. She was troubled by his childishness and he was unwilling to change for the better. Depressed and distraught, finally questioning what role he had to play in his breakups, Rob cycles through five of his old romantic partners to see if there's some sort of consistent screw-up he is faced with in all his relationships.High Fidelity works instantly because of Cusack's character and character acting abilities. He embodies Rob Gordon, who we grow to find likable at times, mostly thanks to his quick-witted mannerisms and ability to keep a conversation moving, and incorrigible at others, for his inability to realize that he is his own worst enemy. Cusack's 'cool guy' approach to the material, complete with first-person narration and frequently employed witticisms, make him nonetheless an interesting protagonist because you can fault him and appreciate him for many reasons, but the main one is that he's human. Louiso and Black work well as the side characters here, in addition, particularly Luiso, who is given some of the funniest lines of the picture. Jack Black is your typical Jack Black character here, but ostensibly boasting more controlled chaos than outright chaos here (either that or his craziness gels well enough with Cusack's coolness that typical results aren't as blatant).Director Stephen Frears and the quartet of writers at hand here (Cusack himself, D.V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink, and Scott Rosenberg) are commendable because they understand the way males think. If a woman goes through a breakup, as least from what I've seen from my female friends and based off knowledge from films I have seen, she often reevaluates herself, checking herself with her friends to see what could've possibly gone wrong and if she had anything to do with the relationship's demise. Men, from what I've seen from my male friends and other films I have seen, are almost too prideful for that sort of thing, rarely showing too much emotion and holding it in for a rainy day. We move on to hooking up, letting our feelings out to only our closest friends, and simply try to find another woman who will provide us not with the same kind of love but the same feelings as the previous gal did.Of course I'm speaking in rampant generalities here; the heart of my argument is that so is Frears and his writers. They're evaluating the character based on terms typical of the male psyche, and are effective in at least portraying a pragmatic situation for a character who has been through a plethora of rough breakups. High Fidelity also features the soundtrack from heaven to compliment our leads characters' musical elitism that works to bring life to a screenplay that could've either showed its worn qualities or lessened in impact over time. However, thanks to Cusack as the center of the film, complimented by two other effective actors, the film stands strong and offers us a glimpse into the mind of a male during one of the most vulnerable times in his life.Starring: John Cusack, Jack Black, Todd Louiso, and Iben Hejejle.

Up in the Air," One of the smartest films to emerge from post-recession America
","Up in the Air focuses on Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), a man who has worked for the Career Transitions Corporation (CTC) for several years and has made his living a traveling downsizer, flying all across the United States to lay off white collar workers. He believes in traveling lightly, a philosophy he expands on in the speeches he delivers during his downtime, and resorts to animalistic ideas of walking alone and refusing to bear the baggage relationships, possessions, and other trivial things bring to his structured and meticulously-managed life. His sole goal is to obtain ten million frequent flyer miles, a feat that will grant him not only a personalized flyer card but his name alongside various airplanes, a trait shared by few other individuals.One day, he is called into his office by his boss (Jason Bateman) where he meets Natale Keener (Anna Kendrick), a young, newly-hired idealist who believes she has created a response to the costly operations of the CTC, which currently has numerous men flying around the United States at all times and staying at lavish hotels, compensated by the company they work for. Natalie foresees a future for the company that has the same sort of traveling downsizers operating over the internet, interacting with souls about to be laid off from their jobs through a webchat program, which will prove to be more economically efficient. Ryan is disgusted about this idea, seeing Natalie's innovation as an impersonal way to communicate with people in one of their most emotionally fragile and unstable times of their lives. To show her that this job requires compassion, quick-wittedness, and one-on-one humanity, he takes her along to be his assistant on various jobs in the United States, showing her what the process is like in the flesh. Along the way, Ryan meets Alex (Vera Faminga), a thirty-four-year-old, traveling saleswoman who could be called Ryan's female counterpart, as she operates with the same sort of suave, confident characteristics as him and embraces the fun and freedom that comes with frequent travel. Ryan relishes the fact that he can maintain a casual, friendly relationship with a woman while still 'traveling lightly,' so to speak.Writers Sheldon Turner and director Jason Reitman constantly maintain a human focus and do not get too wrapped up in economical themes or subtext. They center the film entirely on Ryan's life, which is one of the only and most profound depictions of content loneliness I have ever seen. While the film would've been interesting to see Ryan as a quietly-depressed and openly lonely man, entering his later years and realizing he has little to show for it, the suave and confident Ryan we are presented with here works just as well, if not better. Clooney is the ideal actor for Ryan, as he practically oozes these characteristics, and is assisted by the likes of Kendrick and Faminga, who are written with equal attention given to their characters and are not shortchanged as empty female characters.Up in the Air comes just a year after the crippling financial crisis in America, which left the futures of banks, car dealerships, and the entire American economy uncertain and unstable. Interestingly enough, the film offers a fantastic parallel to one of the features the new American economy will have, which is incredible, technological influence from younger people. The film creates an interesting juxtaposition to what you see occurring in the workforce right now, which is younger people slowly weening out the baby-boomer generation and initiating sweeping technological changes to businesses and industries. In the film, we see Ryan's disgust and disbelief at Natalie's innovation as an underlying theme of the young taking over for the old, and seeing Ryan become beaten at his own game; how long before he finds himself eying himself in the mirror and telling him that he's the one who is fired? Up in the Air is one of the smartest and strongest films to emerge from post-recession America, focusing intently on a character who is more than content with leading a life of functional loneliness from a writer/director who knows how to usher in meaty, contemplative themes while retaining a pleasant, human focus to the material.Starring: George Clooney, Anna Kendrick, and Vera Faminga. Directed by: Jason Reitman.",10,0,1,22 December 2014
Furious 7," Think about Dom and his crew next time you're racing to get to work on time
","The sudden death of Paul Walker in late November 2013, by car accident nonetheless, prompted a whirlwind of shock and tears from the film and car community. One of their own was taken by the very same vice he used to propel his name in film and exercise his passion in the real world. It was a stern reminder to people of two very important things: one, as much as we can go see each new installment of The Fast and the Furious franchise, we must remember that cars are weapons that many of us operate or embrace each and every day and, two, that living religiously by your passion can also warrant you dead by that same passion, and in my mind, that's not a bad way to go.With Walker's death and a cast and crew in mourning, the completion of the seventh installment of The Fast and the Furious franchise was in limbo. Using the process of CGI, an elaborate digital program that allowed for flawless facial reconstruction, casting Cody and Caleb Walker, Paul's brothers, to double as him in numerous scenes, and not focusing too intently on Cody or Caleb during his scenes with close-ups or long takes, Furious 7 was able to be completed and now serves as a satisfying sendoff to an actor that, even non-fans can agree, was taken too soon.At any rate, it must've been tough being Paul Walker's Brian O'Conner character. Not only can you not make up your mind about whether or not you want to leave the FBI or become a full-time fugitive/street-racer, as of late, you're raising a kid with another in tow and have gone from driving tricked-out hot-rods boasting nitrous to a minivan - a vehicle with a sliding door you can't even figure out how to operate. Such is life for O'Conner in Furious 7, as him, his wife Mia (Jordana Brewster), her brother Dom (Vin Diesel), and his wife Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) have returned to the United States after having their fugitive status revoked by U.S. Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson). The gang are trying to live a normal, suburban life when a mysterious package is sent to them from Tokyo and subsequently explodes, causing their home to blow up in smithereens.The bomb was delivered by Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), the brother of Owen Shaw from Fast & Furious 6, who has come for vengeance. Deckard's plan is to exterminate each and every member of Dom's crew, and after successfully killing Dom's trusty mechanic and do-all man Han (Sung Kang) and putting Hobbs in the hospital, Dom knows he's not playing around. Brian, who has admitted not only to missing the bullets and the gunfire above all the racing and the girls that came with it, and Dom have no choice but to round up the remainder of their crew to try and settle the score.The first three Fast and the Furious films were all playful romps that exuded some level of believable qualities and a method to their madness. The fourth film began the descent into grittier action territory, while the fifth film unevenly merged the silliness with the sleek action formula that created a lesser Italian Job film of sorts. The sixth film, the first good film in the franchise since the second, successfully merged the sleek with the silly, emphasizing some pathos and interjecting it in with some seriously eye-popping action sequences. Furious 7, on the other hand, is entirely absurd; a highly energized film filled with muscle and emotion (but not enough to corrupt any masculinity, I assure you), it manages to crank up the lunacy to entirely new levels. While the film may be reset in Los Angeles, it's a Los Angeles that ostensibly takes place on an entirely different planet. Most setups and occurrences in this film are so baffling and logic-defying, they make the famous 'safe' scene I expanded upon in my review of Fast Five look completely and totally plausible.While these sound like criticisms, they are most certainly not. Each Fast and the Furious film comes with a truly riveting and memorable race scene, and this film's most notable one is the series' most bizarre, and this is also considering the opening scene of the fourth film. It involves Brian and Dom escaping a high-rise building in an unfathomable sports car by smashing through its glass front. That seems pretty standard on the surface, until you realize that the two are about sixty stories in the sky and smash through the glass front of the window and successfully land on another skyscraper only to do the same thing and leap to another skyscraper. Watching this play out gave me the feeling that the homey Fast and the Furious films, the first and second one specifically, that echoed those fathomable sensibilities I mentioned earlier are long gone.Unlike the repetitive and almost entirely unrelated Fast Five, Furious 7 keeps the emotional pull here, with the constant emphasis on family and brotherhood in a way that, as cliché as it is, tugs at the heartstrings given the real-life circumstances that really brought this film together. Here, we begin to see Brian and Dom as real people, despite them being ostensibly immune to damn near everything.This is a film that's a sendoff, a love-letter to itself and the communities it helped build and inspire, and those who have watched these characters for well over a decade and have grown to respect them as if they were in their own car group. The film is one big, celebratory 'cheers,' and the multitude of cars revving and reaching incalculable speeds is another way of hearing the 'clink' the champagne glasses - or Corona Extra bottles - make when brought in contact with one another.

The Godfather," The media has made it a mockery you couldn't ignore
","The question everyone will likely ask me upon viewing the lengthy and heavily-celebrated Godfather I will not answer. That question is 'is it really the greatest film of all time?' I can't answer it. I'm in no position to, nor have I seen every film ever made to correctly state that. How can you say what the greatest film of all time is if you haven't seen literally every film ever made? That question will never be answered. If you polled a million people, the question would still be answered with subjectivity. There is no possible way to define what is the greatest film of all time without any subjective input. It can't be done.I will say The Godfather is an important film. Perhaps the greatest, but definitely one of the most important in the history of the art form. Its depiction of the mob, to my knowledge, is dead on, and runs like a stage play or opera at opus length. It is three hours long, and I recommend two or even three sittings before you finish it. To take it in all in one sitting is difficult, not just because of length, but because of content. It is five minutes shy of three hours and feels every bit as long. It's not a problem, since the film immerses you with intricate visuals, dialog, and its casual glide of events, but it makes for a sometimes testing excursion.Everyone knows the story, so I won't go into it. Basically, we follow the Corleone family, an Italian mob run by Don Vito, played with unmatchable talent by Marlon Brando, after his daughter Connie (Shire) is married to Carlo Rizzi (Russo). After that, we see dramatic events following the wedding and run-ins with other gang outlets, fights, and lengthy monologues involving the family.I grew up on Scorsese's mob flicks, and one who has will find a grand difference between Scorsese's portrayal of mob life and Francis Ford Coppola's portrayal. For one, Scorsese's mob films, of course we're primarily speaking of Goodfellas, were more about exploiting the lifestyle, with an outsider looking into the action, who would eventually become one of them. In contrast, Coppola brings us right into the lifestyle, not from an outsider's perspective, but from the perspective of many different family members. Don Corleone is not the main character in the film. Nor is Carlo Rizzi. Surprisingly, Al Pacino's Michael is the one who lifts most of the picture off the ground in terms of characters.Pacino is outstanding. Every scene he's in, he possesses an undeniable screen presence that is equal parts ominous and electrifying. Brando brings a unique sense of direction to the screen as well. He seems calmer, more confident than any mob boss I've seen portrayed before. It doesn't seem like he needs to hammer home the idea he is the boss. He believes without a shadow of a doubt everyone knows it, and if they don't, they soon will.The Godfather, like many classics, shows signs of age. It has a dated look to it, where all its colors appear to be washed out. It doesn't bother me, but I've heard others complain heavily. Some even find it to be 'overrated' and boring. I don't really see it as that, mainly because I can see what makes the film top many 'best film' lists. It has tremendous writing, intricate, serious directing from Coppola, gifted performances, and some of the most impressive cinematography, evoking seriousness, atmosphere, and detail to perhaps the sternest extent.But I can see people being underwhelmed because of one inevitable outlet; pop culture and media. The Godfather has to be one of the most parodied films of all time, with lines, events, and monologues tempered with and mocked in frequent TV shows, movies, and even children's shows. I did a short film in high school about 'The Doughnut Godfather,' where a student dressed up in a fancy suit, put on a luxurious hat, and had a stuffed cat sit on his lap. This could very well make the film lose its serious aspect to some because immediately when we hear the line 'I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse,' we divert our thoughts to where we've heard that before.Another big difference I noticed between Scorsese and Coppola's work is that Scorsese's mobster films are more about history, rather than characters. We do get heavy characterization, but each films seems to have a great deal of respect for mob history and real life events. Coppola focuses a lot more on characterization and performances, as well as creating vignettes involving the Corleone family, showing family meetings and murders. When we look back at Goodfellas, we do think performances, but we more or less think of events that shocked and surprised us. When we think Godfather, we immediately reminisce about the extremely involved and award-worthy performances.This could very well be one of the greatest films I've ever seen, but again, who am I to judge? My job is to say if I enjoyed a film and do I see audiences liking it. I'm sure many, if not every person, reading this review has seen The Godfather, and if not, then they have an extra task on their list. Unfortunately, some won't see the beauty because so many grittier mobster films have come out, that don't involve heavy monologues and intricate performances, and pop culture has greatly subtracted the impact the film once had. This shows gangsters in a different light. Ones that don't feel the need to boast power or success. They know you already know what they've done just by how they speak, act, and move.Starring: Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, and Diane Keaton. Directed by: Francis Ford Coppola.",10,2,5,28 March 2012
