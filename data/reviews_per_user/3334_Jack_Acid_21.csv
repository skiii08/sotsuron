Requiem for a Dream," One of the most overrated films of all time?
","I give this film high marks for its editing and ability to hold true to its gut-wrenching focus from beginning to end. It's hard film to watch...but it also lacks much of a reason to.The story, if you want to call it that, starts and finishes at the same point. There is no beginning, middle or end...it's just a sequence (though a terrifying one at that).For a film to take itself as seriously as this one does, a viewer should...no wait, NEEDS to care about the characters. For me, at no point did I feel much sympathy or care about any of them, with the exception of maybe the mother.Despite my frustrations with the script, it is well acted. It's gritty and certainly conveys the despair and dark underworld of addiction. But again, without any sort of arc, I never felt sucked into it and was really expecting some sort of payoff, which never occurred.The editing is certainly unique and worth showing to film students. I've never seen a film like it from that standpoint.If you can ignore the writing and just 'go along for the ride', then its worth a watch. Personally, I was hoping for more.",6,1,2,24 February 2008
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Unjustly disregarded - *** Possible Spoilers ***
","It's really amusing how fans have reacted to this movie. When it came out, seemingly everyone sheepishly said they liked it. Now Episode II is out (have yet to see it), everyone's first comment is, 'It's so much better than Episode I', or 'I had given up hope on Lucas, but now I'm revitalized!' Episode I is not a stand-alone film, nor should it be. It seems that's how most critics view it. The bottom line is, though not flawless, this is a great installment to the saga and I'll tell you why.First off, Lucas managed to keep the same look and feel for his universe and on a technical note, stayed in line with all of his old cinematic and editing techniques. An example of this would be one scene scrolling away to reveal the next scene, like so many cut sequences in the originals. Most sequences are short and concise, keeping the viewer informed and attentive. This aspect has been confused with Lucas rushing the story, or having written exceptionally bad dialogue. I admit, Lucas will never be remembered for his ability to write dialogue, but this style was more than welcomed in the first three, so why not now? All of these things are very reminiscent of the old films and highly welcome.In fact, with the exception of Jar Jar Binks and an (at times) stiff Obi Wan, all the characters, including young Anakin seem like they could have been in the first films. This is especially true for Qui-Gon Jinn. Liam Neeson does an excellent job of playing a Jedi; he demonstrates the same strength, patience and wisdom of the original Obi Wan. I liked his character a great deal and was sad that he was the fallen one (every Star Wars film needs one!)Many have complained that the storyline is too complex. I found it to be very simple and completely in line with the Star Wars genre. Since the film takes place before the Empire and Rebellion, Lucas is forced to show us something of equally great and dire scale, which he does an excellent job ofdoing between the Planet of Naboo, the Galactic Senate and Jedi Council. Seeing how the galaxy once was and how the situation (from the original films) came to be is a true delight to watch. I don't even have to get into the 'givens', such as the special effects and planetary settings. Even critics of this film cannot deny the fantastic action sequences, namely between Jinn, Kenobi and Maul, which is easily the most spectacular lightsaber duel of all the films (again, I haven't seen Episode II!) The biggest downfall of the film is Jar Jar Binks. Though his character is annoying, he doesn't ruin the film. As a side note, both Lucas and Samuel Jackson publicly said they felt Jar Jar was a failure because the guy who played Jar Jar (Ahmed Best) was black (which I didn't even realize until weeks after seeking the film). This is a pathetic excuse coming from Lucas for creating such a dismal character. Sorry George, it didn't work. That happens sometimes, get over it! The only other gripe would be the at times 'cheesy' moments, such as the Pod Racing announcers, who totally clash with the feel of the film and Star Wars universe by their modern-style announcing and 'grooving' when Anakin wins. Thankfully, their appearance is short.To summarize, this is a decent film and for anyone who's following the Star Wars saga beyond the movies, such as the countless Lucas-endorsed novels (I recommend the Timothy Zahn books), comics, role playing and video games. Anyone who is a casual fan and is expecting this movie to be like the original three may be disappointed. The last point to make is that Episode I will be taken a lot differently when the entire trilogy is released. I guarantee that many people who criticize this film now will like it after Episode III is released in 2005 when they've had a chance to see all three. I sincerely hope Lucas carries out with yet a third trilogy (he's been toying with the idea since the beginning), set years AFTER the original three. Han, Leia and Luke in their 60s?! Gotta see it.",6,0,1,21 May 2002
12 Monkeys," Great concept, shaky execution
","Still have mixed feelings on this film, even having seen it 3 or 4 times. Great concept, great ending.  Just a little fuzzy in telling the story. Given the complexity of the plot, I guess I can't complain. Worth seeing if you likes movies you have to follow closely and have a few twists.  If you're into straight-forward movies with little depth, pass on it.  I give it a 10 in concept and 7 in execution.",7,1,2,28 April 2002
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Over-hyped and overdone
","*CONTAINTS SPOILERS!* While good action sequences and flawless special effects hit the mark, there's far too much fluff and predictability and qualify this as a great film. I'd dare call it a mess.It suffers from all the pitfalls you fear going into a sequel...bloated budget, very little growth from the main characters, overly-complicated plot, countless unnecessary scenes of which very few carry any sort of punch, etc.The biggest problem? The screenwriters clearly were writing to cram in every square inch of anything popular in the first film and force these elements to carry the whole picture....and carry it...and carry it...etc.Some examples - Depp's initially amusing character comes off as very 2-dimentional and cartoon-ish, repeating literally one of 2-3 mannerisms throughout every scene. Honestly one of his less memorable performances, but it's really the fault of the script more than Depp.Keira Knightley's character goes from convincing Sparrow to 'be a good man', then when he does so, she does a complete 180 and makes out with him, ultimately to trick him so that she and the other crew members can escape free and clear of the Kraken. What? That's hardly the Elizabeth Swann we've come to know and understand. Also her death defying sword play compared to her flailing around helplessly like an 8-year old girl when 'the boys' fight. This contrast is too stark to overlook.The inclusion of Norrington is paper thin, and totally unnecessary....not even his completely unexplained connection to the 'white-wigged bad guy' saves his role. And by the way, I refer to him as 'the white-wigged bad guy' because I have no idea who he was, except obviously someone powerful and holds the key to Turner, Swann and Sparrow's pardon and freedom. Why he was even seeking the 'treasure' is never made clear.There was very little dramaÂ…no emotional punch whatsoever.On the plus side, the action sequences were well-done, especially the Kraken scenes. The special effects for the Flying Dutchman crew and Davy Jones were excellent as well (Bill Nighy's performance is commendable and on par with Geoffrey Rush.) If you have a deep love for the fabled stories of the sea (Davy Jones, the Flying Dutchman, the Kraken, etc.) then this is worth a watch. If you're into mindless Hollywood entertainment, this is worth a watch.But if you're looking for a sequel that takes everything you loved from the first film and takes it all further, don't get your hopes up. It's all about the money behind re-hash values, not substance.",6,3,6,21 July 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Once in a while, a Hollywood film wins
","Make no mistake; this is a true Hollywood movie, through and through.  But it's an entertaining one, to be sure.  I was skeptical of its integrity when I learned it was 'based' on the Disneyland ride, let alone a Disney film. But again, it does entertain from start to finish and despite moments of cheesy humor, it's serious enough to satisfy those seeking a more 'real' approach.  For the most part, it's historically correct.  Thankfully, they used fictitious characters instead of tarnishing the reputations of true high sea swashbucklers such as Ed Teach (Blackbeard) and John Rackham (Calico Jack).Depp pulls off a convincing character in Jack Sparrow, especially when you think he based the character on Keith Richards (mannerisms, hair and all). Rush also shines as Barbossa, while Bloom and Knightley fulfill their roles fittingly, though their performances are hardly outstanding.  This has more to do with the script than their abilities.  The cinematography and CG effects are outstanding and very convincing.Another thing this film does pull off well is character development.  They successfully illustrate 8-10 mainstay characters (lead and supporting) without bogging the story down or leaving things incomplete.  This is quite rare in a film and I was pleased at how well it was pulled off.All in all, if you haven't seen this film, do so.  Though you may not be blown away, you should at least be entertained.",8,1,2,8 December 2003
Spider-Man 3," When will Hollywood LEARN?!
","*** SPOILERS *** As a die-hard Spider-Man fan, I enjoyed this film. As a film critic, there's a lot to be desired.The action and effects are easily the best in the series. Some of the most stunning effects I have seen. Unfortunately, the acting and dialogue is probably the worst.The Good: I appreciate what elements Sam Raimi brings to this film from the comic, specifically, the Venom symbiote. It's a gutsy move to include it, because it's a stretch for the casual Spider-Man fan to digest an alien coming down and taking over Peter Parker (& Brock), but hey, it's true to the comic.I also loved the Sandman action sequences, good use of his powers. But making him the gunman of Peter's uncle Ben was a little over the top for me, especially given the ending. To Raimi's defense, at least they give you SOME reason to understand the Sandman's motivations. I was really hoping Venom would be better utilized but he was more of a one-hit wonder character than anything substantial. He's more used as a device to demonstrate the alien's power over people.In the end, the action sequences are wonderful and thrilling and found myself wanting to rewind and watch is slow motion more than once.The Bad: Much of the dialogue is forced, failing to flow nearly as easily or believably as 1 or 2. Tobey Maguire seems far less comfortable with the character in this film, which is surprising and unfortunate. Too many homage scenes too, where the writers felt they should give EVERY character that's been in any of the first films at least 5-10 minutes of screen time (like the landlord and his daughter.) This was a huge complaint I had about Pirates II...give us substance instead of what you THINK we want to see more of.Also, there's times where scenes are so unbelievable from a HUMAN standpoint, you almost can't believe the scene was ever approved. Case in point - in one scene, Gwen Stacy barely clings to a damaged building, dangling 30 stories up. Below are her father and boyfriend watching from the street. One would think they would be panic stricken, especially the father. Instead, both as docile as two strangers watching the evening news. They are so blase in fact, that Brock (Stacey's BF) takes the opportunity to tell the her father that he's been dating her. Meanwhile, she's seconds from death. I felt more panic from the extra in Spider-Man 1 where she's waiting to see if her baby is rescued from a burning building.And my biggest issue should not be news to Hollywood - GOOD MOVIES DO NOT NEED TO BE 2.5 HOURS LONG! This movie could have EASILY dropped 30-40 minutes and been a great film. They spend WAY too long on needless scene after needless scene (the part where Parker shows up with Stacy at the Jazz club could have been a 5 minute scene; instead, it's dragged on for 15 minutes and it's not even a good scene.) What's worse, many of these unnecessary scenes are redundant - how many dramatic scenes do we need to illustrate the tension between Parker and MJ? I didn't count, but it seemed like 20 when there only needed to be maybe 3.In the end, despite my complaints, I did enjoy the film. It's a must-see on the big screen given its effects and cinematography. If there is a SM4, let's hope for a less contrived and convoluted script.",7,14,18,5 May 2007
Lost in Translation," Murray's finest performance makes for a great film for 2003
","Lost in Translation is all-too-often misunderstood. That couldn't be any more evident with it's 500+ '1/5' votes, which is certainly ludicrous, inaccurate and unfair. I understand it may not appeal to everyone, but it's flat out ignorant to deem this as a poor effort or production. It's anything but.Is it perfect? Of course not. But it wholly fulfills what it sets out to do and is a fantastic effort from Ms. Coppola.People may complain that the storyline or plot of this film is thin, but its simplicity is part of its charm. The aesthetics of this film alone make it worth seeing. If you never had an inkling to go to Japan, this film may change that. Coppola's vision of Tokyo and in essence, her 'strangers in a strange land' angle, is strong and prevalent from beginning to end.Bill Murray's performance is outstanding, as well as refreshing. His dry wit and comedy sense permeates throughout much of the film. Scarlett Johansson is also convincing and well portrayed.The cinematography is amazing, and for me, very much part of the film's appeal. I was also thrilled with the ending. Overall, I just enjoyed WATCHING this film. A must see for any fan of Murray or Johansson, as well as those drawn to films centering around human relationship dynamics.I found myself relating to the film's characters on multiple levels and therein lies its strength - capturing the truest thoughts and questions of people as they move through life, but never tries too hard or reaches in order to drive a point home. It never goes over the top for the sake of mindless entertainment.It's an introspective piece and rife with super dry comedy.",9,0,0,10 October 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A magnificent installment, it is
","This is a lengthy review, so for those who are not interested in reading it all: GO SEE THIS FILM. A great thing happened to me when I watched it: I found myself getting completely sucked into it and my comparisons to the old trilogy faded away.For 25 years, fans have clung to the classic characters of Luke, Leia, Han, etc. Now Lucas asks that you immerse yourself in the WHOLE STORY, the roots of young Skywalker and the Jedi, and the rise of the Empire. You simply cannot and will not enjoy this film (or the trilogy as a whole) if you're hell-bent on it being like the originals. IT'S NOT THE ORIGINALS and quite frankly, it's wonderful. The only true comparison of the original trilogy is that the story is TOLD like the originals, and that's what should satisfy fans.Enough of the commentary, here's the breakdown (SPOILERS AHEAD):This film is fun. So many elements that I was hoping to see more of in the first film, totally come to life in this installment.CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: Unlike Menace, there is some emotional intensity in Clones. Despite most people's gripes about the romantic aspect (namely the clunky dialogue and pace of these scenes), Padme and Anakin's romance is important to the story. After all, they are Luke and Leia's parents, and Padme signifies Anakin's first step towards pulling away from the life of the Jedi. The slaughtering of the Tusken Raiders is a great demonstration of Anakin losing control and giving into hatred, the seed of the Dark Side of the Force.To address the barrage of complaints regarding the dialogue; yes, there are a few bad lines, but nothing detrimental. Additionally, if you're going to condemn Clones for dialogue breakdown, you may as well condemn the whole franchise, because it's never been a strong suit of the series.Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan is much more relaxed and settled than in Menace. The struggle between him and Anakin in terms of discipline is well executed and comes off much like a father/son relationship. It also illustrates Kenobi's shortcomings as a mentor and justifies his eagerness to train Luke in Episode IV. In watching Episode IV now, it's apparent that Kenobi feels an obligation of 'righting a wrong' and feels a great deal of guilt for his training and failure of Anakin/Vader.We get to see a lot more of both Yoda and Mace Windu, though Sam Jackson never seems overly comfortable, or maybe he's trying too hard. Still, he gets in a few classic Samuel Jackson trademark 'bad ass' lines when he confronts Dooku. Portman as Padme is much deeper than Episode I and is very 'Leia-like' when all hell starts to break loose. Like Kenobi, her character definitely emerges stronger by the end of the film.It's also great to Boba Fett as a youth, and we now understand what drives him to wear the Mandilorian armor and follow his father's bounty hunter footsteps. SETTING: This film features the most breathtaking of settings of all the movies, hands down. Thanks heavens Lucas gives us more of Coruscant, a place all fans have craved since the end of the digitally re-mastered version of Return of the Jedi. We get more in Episode I, but a full dose in Clones. Lucas also takes us to 2 new planets; the rain and ocean swept Kamino and the barren Geonosis. There's also a plethora of new species; the Kaminoans, the lanky aliens of Kamino are both strange and fascinating. Bottom line, this movie is GORGEOUS. PLOT: Having known the back-story of the original films, I found the plot both compelling and easy to follow. Casual fans may think otherwise. But you can't argue with a plot that unfolds the beginnings of the Empire and rise of Palpatine.EFFECTS: There have been an alarming number of complaints regarding the amount of CG used in the movie. I thought the use of it was flawless, in both setting and the alien races. For those of you who want to bring back the Yoda puppet, consider the duel with Dooku; not possible with a puppet and I don't think there's a soul out there who would trade in that scene for anything. The effects are spectacular, especially in the (almost) finale scene where the clones and droids are fighting in the dust clouds left in the wake of the fallen starship. Beautiful.ACTION: Need I bother? Again, action is abundant and some of the best cinema I have ever seen. People complain it's 'too slow' in the middle, but it's important that we get somewhat of a feel for Anakin's/Padme's relationship. I found the pacing just fine and completely acceptable.CLIFFHANGER: The ending is almost a mirror of Empire, much like Menace was to A New Hope. I won't give away specifics, but my appetite is plenty whet for Episode III.To summarize, like Empire, Clones is a compelling installment to the trilogy and very exciting. It will most definitely please fans WHO LOVE STAR WARS. For those who are still whining about Phantom Menace and plan to scrutinize every move that Lucas makes, don't bother. You're only setting yourself up for disappointment; not because Clones is a bad movie, but because you're still clinging to the originals as a point of reference. Comparison of both trilogy's is inevitable and reasonable, TO A POINT. But one needs to let go and just enjoy them as they are, much like we did back then. Episode II gives the new trilogy shape and depth. To me, it is now it's own franchise, as it should be.",7,0,1,23 May 2002
Spider-Man," Near perfect Cross Over - Villains need a lot of work
","Well, Spidey has been a favorite of mine since before I can remember and I was a bit scared when I heard they were doing a film, only because of the seemingly perpetual flops of comic book adaptations (Xmen, the Batman sequels, the Punisher, etc.)This movie however, for the most part, does Spidey great justice.  The way the film is shot and paced, it's very comic book-like, which is great.  The action and effects are excellent and the human element between not only Peter Parker and Mary Jane, but between Parker and Harry Osborne, Harry and Norman Osborne, Peter and Aunt May, etc is also very well portrayed.I had only two complaints about the film (POSSIBLE SPOILERS); the first is the lack of wisecracks from Spidey, who has always been notorious for making jokes in the heat of battle against the likes of Goblin, Venom, Sandman, Doc Ock, etc.  Though McGuire gets in a few good one liners (usually as Parker), I wish they had included more from Spidey in mid-battle.  It sounds like a tacky request, but that's what made Spider-Man so great, his humor.The second complaint is the Green Goblin, a most pathetic villain at best. Willem Dafoe, who I'm sure plays the part as good as he could with the given script, is just a one dimensional foe, mindlessly bombing and gunning down pedestrians.  I never found myself hating him or even really caring if he succeeded in his `mad' plans forÂ….whatever he wanted.  He was simply a formality of the film, a big bad guy for Spidey to beat.  Beyond his lack of purpose, I was deeply disappointed that they used the costume they did.  It was the only injustice the film does to the original comic (thank goodness they left Spidey's costume alone!)  I was much more inclined to comic artist Alex Ross' design . The GG outfit they used was far too futuristic and plastic looking.Lastly, I truly appreciated the ending (HUGE SPOILERS!); the swelling hatred from Harry towards Spiderman and the broken heart of Mary Jane.  Classic sequel setup and very comic-like, leaving us all waiting with anticipation for the next `issue'.Rating: 8/10",8,0,0,17 June 2002
Quantum of Solace," More like Casino Royale 1.5, but still good fun
","I was surprised to see so much negative reaction to this film after the highly well-received Casino Royale. It seemed like Craig was quickly embraced by the Bond community, so how bad could it be? For the record, I was never a huge Brosnan fan.Granted, QoS is not the same caliber as Casino Royale, but that's mostly because it plays out like an extended cut of CR. This Bond offers plenty of action and an ice cold Bond in Craig, but it is not as much of a stand alone film.If you're looking for an ultra traditional Bond, or one that stands entirely on its own merit, you may be disappointed. The script does have issues, but it never seemed to drag it down for me.Personally, I left the theater feeling quite satisfied.",7,7,13,25 January 2009
District 9," The Fly meets Independence Day meets ET = SUCCESS
","Even though I had heard good reviews, I resisted knowing a thing about this and went in cold. What unfolded was one of the more gripping cinema experiences I've had in years.If I had to use one word to describe the film, it would be 'intense'. The scope of the film covers such a broad array of real-world topics (as any good sci-fi does), ranging from racism, to animal testing, to genocide, famine, corporate war-lust, the list goes on. But the beauty of District 9 is not its political overtones, but rather its emotion. It's able to wrap all these elements together in a very compelling and believable way. Of course it takes a few Hollywood liberties, but they are NOT cheap and you find yourself almost feeling senses of relief when they occur.Nothing about this film feels rushed or overdone. Everything unfolds very organically and there are enough story devices at work that you will have a hard time second guessing what will happen next. This is an exceedingly rare quality in film today.The CGI effects are sound and I can't applaud Sharlto Copley enough for his performance. His character portrayal is stunning in its scope and depth (plus some great dry, awkward humor) and this role will certainly put his name on the map.Last comment - even though there is plenty of brutal violence, the film never holds your nose to it...just enough to make you squirm a bit. I will say that it is not a film for everyone.Both the premise and execution of of District 9 were ambitious, and in the end, wildy successful. This film will be discussed for years.",8,3,6,7 September 2009
School of Rock," Skeptical of plot, but overall entertaining
","I normally don't go for films with kids in them, primarily because I rarely find them entertaining.  Not so with this movie.  I found myself laughing through the majority of it.It's far from a film with an 'unusual plot', but again, the entertainment is there, especially for anyone who is a fan of rock 'n' roll.  Black reminded me of many of my friends from high school, as I'm sure is true for many people out there.Bottom line: Worth seeing for a good laugh.",7,0,0,9 October 2003
Transformers," Not a perfect adaption, but much better than expected
","As many fans who have posted here, I was a huge Transformers as a kid...I had many of the toys, saw the 80s animated film in the theater and have followed the more recent animated 'Energon' series.While I was disappointed by the fact that there were only a handful of Transformers and some of the character models (I've never preferred Prime with a moving mouth), this movie exceeded my expectations. And mind you, leading up to this film, those expectations were very low. First off, these types of old toy/comic/cartoon revival films rarely pan out well (remember Masters of the Universe? What a rape job...I would KILL for an updated, good adaption of He-Man!); the other detriment is that it's a Michael Bay film, whom I've never been impressed with. But he surprised me here.I think Spielberg's role helped out in droves here to temper Bay's action-lust style. Granted, the action doesn't stop for the entire film, but what downtime does exist is filled with good (and much unexpected) humor without degrading the 'coolness' of the Transformers. It even had decent touches of drama and sentiment. In essence, the plot was true to the original series - which was never overwhelmingly original - but works fine for the sake of this film. In fact, there was some good layering to the background story and how the original discovery of the Transformer's existence shaped modern technology. Of course there are some over the top elements to the plot, but how could anyone expect any different? If you enjoy what you're seeing, let it roll and that was true for me.I think most people (especially casual fans or non-fans) will walk away from this at least appreciating it as a great action film with spellbinding effects. No sense in giving detail here, but this is a big screen film for sure. Despite how long it takes to actually see the majority of the Transformers, there is good suspense and buildup to their unveiling (especially Prime). And after they have all arrived, we see PLENTY of them.Despite the film's length, it never seemed to drag on. I'd love to see future installments take us to different planets and have Megatron be revived as Galvatron. A power struggle between Megatron/Galavtron and Starscream would also be a nice twist and ode to the old premise of the Transformers' chemistry with one another. And hey wait, add Unicron to the wish list! What's more threatening than a Transformer that devours planets?I think this is a great film for any action/effects fan, and while I'm sure some Transformers fans might disapprove of this chapter, it's a must-see just to know either way. I for one, was satisfied.What's next for Hollywood and Hasbro? My guess would be 'Yo Joe!'",8,1,3,6 July 2007
Garden State," A good stab, but maybe not as good as you've been told
","Although I found this to be an enjoyable film, mostly for its quirky commentary on modern pop culture, I didn't find it nearly as overwhelming as my friends and critics had built it up to be.I think this was a good first outing for Braff, but I wouldn't go as far as brilliant, as many people may lead you to believe. Because I wouldn't know if 'brilliance' was Braff's aim, I can't fault it for falling short in that capacity.On the plus side, I found it amusing and an easy viewing. The story is simple, touching on ageless issues such as guilt, parental conflict, nostalgia, love, discovery, etc. I was a little annoyed with the constant interjection of music to help illustrate...I always feel music should accompany a film, not drive it. In other words, there were times I felt the scenes were written around the music, vs. the other way around.Still though, it was enough to provoke me to keep an eye on Zach Braff. He may have some good things, even better things, to show us yet.",7,1,2,27 February 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Burton and Depp strike again
","***MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD*** Well, for those of us who consider themselves Tim Burton fans, this film doesn't disappoint. Burton is yet again able to connect to a wider audience, while still interjecting his darker style and presence. Johnny Depp as Wonka is somewhat of a Jekyll & Hyde character....removed from human contact long before the Gold Ticket winning children arrive; all the while he struggles with his own inner demons when it comes to children, human empathy in general and a closeness to those he loves (in this case, his father.) As expected from Burton, the film's environment and world is greatly exaggerated, which is as the story calls for. Freddie Highmore and David Kelly add a more believable and human side to the film, while Wonka provides the mad hatter elements and quirky dialog. Sometimes his mannerisms and demeanor work and sometimes they don't.As with most films these days, they could have shaved 20 minutes off of it to keep its pace. For me, that would have included cutting the relatively worthless musical numbers that we're subjected to as each child is dramatically sucked into the factory's inner workings.However, the message is what we're left with, which is ultimately to be grateful for what you have and good things will come to you. We finally connect more with Wonka as he accepts the concept of family and allowing people to be close to him.Definitely worth a viewing for visuals alone and memorable performances from Depp and company to boot.",7,3,4,31 July 2005
The Dark Knight," More carelessly told than Begins, but Dark Knight redefines the comic genre in film
","This is one of those rare films where my expectations were not only a bit higher than normal, but they were also equally fulfilled.Nolan is giving us a number of stories here, almost more like a Gotham Chronicles story than JUST a Batman story. This film is as much about Jim Gordon, Harvey Dent and even the every day people of Gotham as much as it is about Bruce Wayne/Batman or the Joker.What impressed me about the writing is how Nolan was able to convey, in a very real-world sense, the anxiety and life-questions that a man like Bruce Wayne would have to make as a true, living breathing crime fighting vigilante. There was cause and effect of being such a figure and his impact had more repercussions than he foresaw. The psychological warfare between Batman and the Joker (even Dent) is mostly well-handled and illustrated, adding a nice layer of richness to the film's finished product. However, sometimes Nolan tries to include TOO MUCH, and there's times where scenes are left a bit unfinished or have loose ends, which is too bad, but mostly forgivable.On the flip-side of 'real-world' sensibility, one personal disappointment is that the credo of Nolan's Batman about 'realism' (technically and physically) is nowhere to be found here. All the care and effort to explain Batman's gadgets, his trials and errors as a rooftop leaping vigilante all are gone. We don't see the time it takes Wayne to develop something of Fox's into his Batsuit or repertoire. In one scene he's shown it, the next he's using it in almost unbelievable scope and fashion. Much of the action demands much more suspension of disbelief (unlike in Begins), and a lot of it plays out like a James Bond film. In fact, this is more or less 'Batman 007', which ultimately, isn't such a bad thing since we're talking comic source material here. Nolan makes up for this deviation with purely satisfying Batman fanfare action sequences and capturing our hero at his best.The film is a bit bleak and very dark in tone - Nolan doesn't pull a lot of punches and the result is plenty of moments of grim suspense and anticipation. This is wholly satisfying for many Batman fans, especially the Joker, who is played at his darkest core. I found myself holding my breath with anticipation at a few moments, and Nolan seems to change up the outcomes JUST enough to keep you guessing. I wouldn't recommend this to kids under 12 or so. Not so much gory, as it is intense subject matter and mature themes.I found the performances of all the cast to be top-notch. In fact, the Joker (exceptionally well-played by Ledger) begins the film as a question mark, and ends it just the same, which I think was sort of the angle here. His purpose is more or less to force Batman to question his own limits and reasons for purpose, using madness for this reason above logic, making him Batman's most enigmatic foe.We also get to see the promotion of Jim Gordon to Commissioner, which was anticipated given his lesser badge status in Begins. Oldman steps up his game from Begins, and his role serves as the best view for the audience.Maggie Gyllenhaal is a more watchable Rachel Dawes, but her character is little more than a device here. By the end of the Dark Knight, it's clear her purpose was far better suited in Begins as Bruce's childhood friend. Still, Gyllenhaal is plenty serviceable and doesn't take an ounce away here.Harvey Dent is perhaps, the biggest surprise of the story and I was impressed with Aaron Eckhart's performance. His story is perhaps the greatest arc of the film, although I thought his 'point of no return' was a little rushed and hard to believe.Morgan Freeman is back as our new favorite 'Q', Lucias Fox, offering up new technology for Batman's disposal...but we also get to see a bit of his role as head of Wayne Corporation and his own personal convictions and responsibilities.In the end, I would qualify the Dark Knight as the the best Batman film to date, going back as far as you want to. I can also say this is quite possibly the best COMIC film to date. But what surprised me, was that this was one of the best CRIME films I've seen in a long time.The Dark Knight offers plenty of bang for your buck.",8,5,10,20 July 2008
The Matrix Reloaded," Outstanding effects, some magic lost
","It's going to be expected...the beauty of the first film took you inside a normal guy making realizations about the 'reality' of this world and our way of life. We as the audience could relate to him.In Reloaded, all that's gone and it's far more driven by modern intrigue and war between human and the machines. Not that this is a bad thing, but again, it takes away the viewers sense of being able to relate.However, as a sci-fi action (oh my, the action) film, it's one of the more spellbinding films I've seen. The effects are stunning, primarily because they have to use real people throughout the majority of the film, not just relying on computer generation.The story is generic, but still acceptable and we do not lose sight of Neo as a person, as opposed to being just a warrior or 'savior'. This film is far sexier than the first and more bold in terms of adult themes, which I was thankful for. I hate it when good films are downplayed to reach a broader audience. The creators of the film keep the mood and genre very consistent with what you'd expect. They also did a good job of making Neo seem unstoppable, as he seemed to be in the end of the first film, but still vulnerable because of his human nature.I gave this one a high rating, for pure entertainment value alone. I will be curious to see the third installment, so the full story is complete. However, I suspect it will be much of the same as Reloaded.",7,0,0,15 May 2003
Wedding Crashers," Vaughn is gold, the humor doesn't disappoint
","This is a great comedy all the way through, though it fails to escape some of the most clichÃ© romantic comedy traps. Such as the final 'profession of love' sequence. However, I found myself laughing out loud throughout the entire film, and that for me, is rare.Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson play their parts flawlessly, especially Vaughn. He's at his best in this type of role, a character reminiscent of his breakout performance in Swingers, though he ultimately shows more depth here.Though the story often times seems over the top and contrived, it all seems perfectly OK and as a viewer wanting to be simply entertained, it does so well. Besides, there are enough genuine offbeat scenes and humor to keep it fresh (the Vaughn bedroom scene comes to mind).The whole nudity issue that seems to be so prevalent in the hype is GROSSLY OVERRATED. I'm not even sure why anyone who has seen it would think twice of it. All the nudity is not much more than flashes; certainly nothing to warrant the buzz it has created.In the end, this is a genuinely funny film and worth seeing, especially for fans of Vaughn, Wilson or Rachel McAdams.As a pure side note, I was surprised that most of the people in the theta when I saw it were significantly older, most over 55. I guess its appeal is more wide spread than one might think.",7,1,6,16 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," And so the prequels go out with a bang...
","Man oh man. Lucas and company have done the unexpected, which was pull off a near masterpiece to salvage the prequels and perhaps the entire Star Wars franchise as a whole among its deepest fans, which I consider myself to be.Technically and visually, this is perhaps the best film of all six. True enough, nothing will take away from the magic of any of the first three, but this film can easily be held in their ranks and in many ways, goes beyond. It's almost a stand-alone film, with only the back-story of the Clone Wars being necessary to fully understand it. It could have easily been the only film of the prequels and been just as satisfying.I'll spare you the plot that so many of you know; what is finally touched here is an emotional understanding within the Star Wars universe, much like both EMPIRE and RETURN OF THE JEDI were to able to capture through the relationship between Luke and Vader. What are captured are many things: a history and deeper portrayal of Palpatine and his rise to power. The pain of Obi-Wan as he watches his apprentice fail. The burning desires of PadmÃ© to retire with Anakin and their baby to a life of normality, free of politics and code. Lastly, we bear witness to the walls caving in around Anakin in his attempt to maintain balance between the Republic he has been always sworn to protect, his wife and unborn child(ren) and finally his ambition for power to protect all of the above.Lucas takes the time to allow the viewer to absorb the events unfolding, to demonstrate the scale of the dark curtain known as the Empire falling and lastly, to show the beauty of the Star Wars universe.Though I would regard SITH as perhaps the most emotional of all six films, it still maintains a breakneck pace of action and sheer visual splendor. He uses elements that have been void of all six films, which only enhance the film's flavor, such as dream sequences, and cinematics that again, allow the viewer to take in the rich environments.The pacing of the film is very well done, far better than either Episode I or II. The stunning visuals, sounds and design are right there with the likes of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and perhaps beyond, because the worlds are all immersive. You're never once reminded that you're sitting on earth in packed movie house. You always remain in that galaxy far, far away.The performances of Ewan McGregor, Ian McDiarmid and (mostly) Hayden Christensen (whose performance did not impress me in ATTACK OF THE CLONES) are standouts, especially McGregor and McDiarmid.I know that I was taken to the first two Star Wars films when I was young, but I only remember going to RETURN OF THE JEDI (I was 7.) This film brought closure to all of the prequels and has now enriched the originals even further. Because in the end, despite such grim events transpiring, you're left with a glimmer of hope that inspires you to root for the likes of Luke, Obi-Wan, Yoda (and ultimately, Vader) all over again.Hats of to Lucas and all hands on deck, this is a must see film for any Star Wars fan and even those who have yet to discover its magic.",8,1,3,20 May 2005
Scream," Great movie - ruined by sequels!
","I'm rarely actually scared by movies.  I hate trendy movies that feature people from trendy TV shows.  That's why I was truly shocked to have liked Scream as much as I did.  The opening scene truly terrified me and I loved the humor of the 'scary movie' theme that was carried through the film. Unfortunately, I was turned off immediately when the killer(s) are revealed. Would have been far better if the killer was never caught or identified.I saw Scream 2, knowing it would be terrible compared to the first and I was not proven wrong.  Never saw the third film.  The first is certainly worth seeing though, with great suspense and great humor.",8,0,0,28 April 2002
The Breakfast Club," Like it or not, this movie is the voice of the 80s
","My ex has a personal theory....there are two kinds of people: there are 'Clubbers' (Breakfast Club fans) or 'Heathers' (Heathers fans). I'm far and away a Clubber. Watching this film now, I definitively find parts of it tacky and little overdone. However, you can't deny that it spoke for its generation and it serves it purpose: to demonstrate the hardships of growing up (especially in high school when your adulthood is taking shape) and of course, John Hughes' very blantent stereotyping that represents the different walks of life that we come into contact with on a daily basis. Not the most sophisticated of concepts, but the setting and cast make it interesting.It's sort of strange, but I've seen this film listed as both a comedy and a drama. I'd have a hard time making that distinction too, unless a '80s Teen Anthem' category becomes a reality in the near future. I'll always have a place in my heart for this movie (probably helps that I was 12 when I first saw it!) and it's still a great movie for people to see. Judd Nelson's role alone is worth the watch. This film made a huge John Hughes fan out of me and no, I can never hear the song 'Don't You Forget About Me' again without thinking of the film.",9,0,1,28 April 2002
