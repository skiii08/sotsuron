Walk the Line," Phoenix brings Cash to life.
","Going into the movie theater, I had never even listened to a full song by Johnny Cash. I was interested in the movie because I could tell from the commercials alone that it was Oscar worthy. Not only did I leave with a greater appreciation for the actors, but a new love for Johnny Cash. The man in black lived a rough life behind the scenes, and Joaquin did an excellent job of portraying him. Witherspoon also managed to play a believable June Carter, she brought new life to the role and her voice wasn't half bad either. Overall, this movie was utterly amazing. I would see it again, and definitely recommend it to anyone and everyone.",10,2,4,20 November 2005
