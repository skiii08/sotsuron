The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Review about the Perks of Being a Wallflower
","The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a movie adapted from the epistolary novel written by Stephen Chbosky about Charlie played by Logan Lerman, a teenager who lives his freshman year of high school. He has to cope with struggles such as the suicide of his best friend, his difference compared to the others teenagers, problems with his family,... During the year, Charlie will get closer to Sam and her step-brother, Patrick played by Emma Watson and Ezra Miller. During the movie, you learn more about Charlie's life and that he has to cope with more than high school problems. This story shows many teenagers' issues.I think that many teenagers could relate to it. I really recommend this movie or even the book, because it is a very moving story.",8,2,4,22 October 2013
