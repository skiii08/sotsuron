The Blair Witch Project," Disappointing, not scary
","My 15-year-old daughter & I went to see the Blair Witch Project, that I'd heard from several people was 'the scariest movie they'd ever seen'. My daughter thought it was scary, I thought it was crappy. The acting is very good - the actors appear absolutely natural, which is how it's supposed to look. I think you're supposed to empathise with the characters and feel sorry for their demise; I found them a bunch of losers who couldn't read a map, have no survival skills whatsoever, and who spend their time bickering about whose fault it is they're lost - by the end of the movie I thought they got what they deserved. I was more frustrated than terrified. Maybe I'm getting too cynical. The movie itself is very well done, definitely worth seeing, but not particularly scary.",Null,0,1,2 August 1999
