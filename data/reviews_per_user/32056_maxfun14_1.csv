Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Only Jacky & Cruzzzzzzz
","Well i think compare to last part it's good,with a new strong script.But cant compare with 1 & 2 part.Some of our favorite characters from the series return, namely Captain Hector Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush) who is now a privateer under the crown. We are also introduced to new characters: Angelica (Penelope Cruz) and the feared Blackbeard (Ian McShane), who behold are also looking for the fountain, in fact that really sums up the plot.About its 3D,effects are not great what i was expected.But I've always enjoyed pirate movies,but i count Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011)in my list.So,if you are a good fan Of Jhony Deep,ants too see stunning Penelope....then go see it for laughs, fun, and a moment of escapism into a world where the supernatural exists, there's lost treasure to be found and adventures to be had.",6,0,1,22 May 2011
