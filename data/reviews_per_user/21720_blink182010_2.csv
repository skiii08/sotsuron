Requiem for a Dream," Shocking
","This film was devastatingly amazing. Darren Aronofsky does not hold back at all, this is a rare film, one that does not contain a happy ending, in fact the ending is as far away from happy as you can get. Ellen Burstyn was robbed of the Oscar which she rightly deserved, all the actors were believable in their roles and made you feel sorry for them even though their turmoil was their own fault. This film shows drug addiction from a different, more shocking side and beautifully portrays the emotional turmoil that addiction makes people experience and shows how low addicts go to get a fix. This is one film that you will never forget and will change your life forever.",10,0,1,3 January 2008
Fight Club," It is impossible not to break the first and second rules of Fight Club...
","...Which are both 'you do not talk about Fight Club' I first watched this film about 3 or 4 years ago and it has been my favourite movie ever since and has made Edward Norton one of my favourite actors.It's not only the clever dialogue, perfect casting and amazing acting that makes this film my favourite but also the small details that director David Fincher adds to make it an immaculate and flawless film. I will always wonder why Brad Pitt and Edward Norton were not even nominated for Oscars when films like Monster's Ball and Shakespeare In Love won best actress Oscars for Halle Berry and Gwyneth Paltrow who were lousy compared to Pitt and Norton but i can guarantee that anyone who sees this film no matter how old they are will not be disappointed.",10,2,7,3 January 2008
