The Blair Witch Project," Could have been much more
","I was genuinely looking forward to this one. The buzz had been circulating for months  ever since patrons had run out of screenings for it at the Sundance Festival that year.By the time it was finally released in the UK I guess there was such a wave of hyper following it, that it was almost certain to be a disappointment and unfortunately it was  very much so.I love psychological horror as much as anyone and whilst enjoying my fair share of gore and effects driven films, can certainly appreciate that often the most scariest of things happen in the mind, not in what you see on the screen. The trouble with this film is that it didn't really show anything  it wasn't creepy or frightening, just monotonous. It had a few brief moments which created shivers, but not many. It's a great shame because the whole concept is excellent and the myth of the Blair Witch' is quite frightening. This film just never delivered. It needed something more than what it had.
A missed opportunity and certainly NOT the new Exorcist', despite such claims at the time of release.",Null,0,1,6 August 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," High Seas adventures - terrifically Entertaining!
","This is one fun movie and well, the typically excellent Johnny Depp is absolutely pitch perfect as 'Jack Sparrow', playing him with just the right sense of 'tongue in cheek' and sincerity rolled into one.The premise is simple - there's a ship called 'The Black Pearl' which is rumoured to have a ghost crew, led by a captain 'so evil, hell spat him out'. Elizabeth Swann (a duly beautiful Keira Knightley) gets kidnapped by the crew and her childhood friend Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) sets out to save her, with the help of Jack Sparrow, the only pirate who knows how to get to the dreaded 'Black Pearl'.Cue endless adventures, swordfights, mirth, comic twists and the hunt for buried treasure and you have one of the most solidly entertaining blockbusters of many years. It's aimed at all ages, but with a subtle humour and knowing for the adults.Terrific fun - worth watching and far more entertaining than it perhaps deserves to be, you'd be a fool to miss this one.",Null,0,0,8 December 2003
Spider-Man 2," Better than expected
","I went into this one feeling reasonably nonplussed, having seen the first one which got rave reviews from everywhere in the UK and yet I thought was good, but not great.This, however, is not the same as Spiderman 2. Here we have a film that is far more mature than its predecessor, with much more action and a most intriguing storyline. There are no real twists as it's fairly apparent what's going to happen, but the acting was excellent throughout and there was a genuine care and loving attention to detail captured in this film, once again showing just what a great Director Sam Raimi can be and how good the cast and crew are that work with him on this franchise.Well recommended, in my opinion far superior to the first film and far better paced, one more for the adults perhaps, but still good, clean pop-corn fun for all to enjoy. Hats off as well to 'Doc Ock' who seems a far more realistic and believable villain. In some ways, this film reminded me of Superman 2. When you watch it, you'll know exactly what I mean, but it stands on its own as a genuine crowd-pleaser and certainly deserves the praise and business it's receiving from the Box Office.If this is the direction the Spiderman franchise is going, then roll on Spiderman 3, I await with much anticipation!",Null,0,0,23 July 2004
The Matrix Revolutions," Awesome and Engrossing
","Absolutely incredible film; finishes the trilogy off perfectly. The Wachowskis had us all asking so many questions after Reloaded, it was great to see they didn't go for that stupidly lame 'Matrix within a Matrix' idea, which would have felt like one big cheat (otherwise where does it end??).The film does start off a little slowly, but then picks up pace and keeps going, including a battle scene at Zion that has to be seen to believed and a fight between Neo and Smith which is insane.I suppose the old adage of 'you can't please all of the people all of the time' is true, but for the reviews that slated it, well we're all entitled to our opinions but I have to disagree - this was a really enjoyable, well-made piece of cinema. It was intelligent, subtle in places and had the right mix of action and drama. One of the classics of Sci-Fi Action no doubt and I'm sure time will prove this to true.It's simple - go see it, make up your own mind - don't be swayed too much either way, but for my money, it doesn't get much better than this.",10,0,0,6 November 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Excellent!
","I went into this not expecting much - it's been 12 years since T2, Arny's now 56 and James Cameron's not directing.Well, I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. Kristanna Loken as the T-X was perfect; menacing and unstoppable throughout the film. Arny looks as impressive as he did in T2 and must have worked hard to get back into that kind of shape; it's incredible to think he's almost 60! Claire Danes was very good as the love interest and bewildered heroine of the story and Nick Stahl was excellent as the young John Connor. The story was very good - it leads up to an exciting climax which surely paves the way for yet another Terminator sequel and the action set pieces were superb! Well done to Jonathan Mostow for pulling this off, a very enjoyable and logical addition to this important franchise.",Null,0,0,4 August 2003
The Shining," Awesome and Horrific
","Apparently when Stephen King saw this film, he was so appalled he went and made a TV mini-series of the book instead. Stephen - you may be a terrific writer, but you're a truly lousy judge of film.This is perhaps one of the best horror films ever made, which is both genuinely frightening and intelligent. It forces us to witness a man's trip into utter madness and an environment filled with fear and dread.Some truly shocking moments and genuine scares - this is what horror is all about.Hats off to Kubrick for making an outstanding film. If you haven't seen this (where have you been?), see it today",Null,0,1,28 July 2003
Face_Off," Absolute Action!
","Nicolas Cage and John Travolta in a John Woo movie. How could this possibly fail? It doesn't  this is probably one of the most enjoyable, high-octane OTT actioners of the last decade.The plot is fairly out there'  a cop is chasing a known criminal who years earlier shot his son (by mistake). The criminal falls into a coma but has left a bomb big enough to level an entire city. The cop undergoes radical surgery and has the criminal's face grafted onto his own skull, so that he looks exactly like him. He then goes into prison to ask the brother about the bomb.And that's just the start of the film! It's total brain-out' popcorn fodder, but of the very highest order as Woo pulls out all the stops to create some of the most memorable action sequences in recent memory. The acting is superb (as to be expected of the two leads) and the far-fetched story is surprisingly coherent with a very tight plot.Excellent fun  and one you could watch over and over.",Null,0,0,6 August 2003
Dark City," Excellent - all sci-fi fans should see this film.
","Dark City is all about a man who has incredible powers but doesn't realise it. Everyone is under the control of mysterious 'strangers' who are injecting them with false memories/altering their reality. This one man who spends half the film finding out just who he is and what he can do eventually takes on these strangers and well.. watch the film!Fantastic sci-fi and as you can see from the description above, it bares more than a passing resemblance to 'The Matrix', but was made before it - therefore as I'm watching this film, I'm beginning to realise that The Wachowskis must have watched it and probably before they started making their film. Not that I'm knocking 'The Matrix', which to me is one of the best sci-fi actioners of all time, but 'Dark City' is  equally as entertaining with a very slightly different twist.This film deserves far more recognition that it has received and is, quite frankly, one of the best sci-fi films I've ever seen. Utterly compelling, interesting and entertaining, if you're a sci-fi fan, you simply have to watch this.",Null,0,1,17 December 2003
American History X," Super Strong and excellent
","This is a cracker-jack of a film. It deals with very sensitive issues head on and will leave you thinking for hours after the final credits.Norton plays Derek Vinyard, a neo-nazi posterboy who sadistically kills two black men who are trying to steal his car. Furlong is his younger brother Danny, who looks up to Derek and is keen to follow in his footsteps.During his time in Prison, Derek gradually begins to see the error of his ways and when he is released, decides to start life afresh and try to prevent his young brother from following him into prison.It's shocking stuff with some outstanding acting on display (especially Norton whose impressive physique in the film only adds to the realism of the character) and some great set pieces. The ending comes as a total surprise and doesn't let the film down in any way.Compelling, exciting and thought-provoking, this is a film everyone should see.",Null,0,0,18 August 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Breath-taking!
","When I saw the first 'Lord of the Rings' (Fellowship of the Ring) film last year I was bowled over by the incredible visuals and set-pieces.Having just seen this new one, I can say that the visuals in this are even better and the action in simply breath-taking. The film builds slowly throughout its massive 3 hour running time to a gorgeous, huge battle at Helms Deep, pitting 10,000 Orkai (I think that's the correct spelling?) against hundreds of men and elves.The action in this film is well paced and the characters are developed further. On the big screen the whole film is a true spectacle to behold and one of the best films I've seen in a very long time.It's simple - if you haven't seen this yet, then go see it today on the big screen, you'll love it!10 out of 10 .. Peter Jackson - you are a genius Director!",10,0,0,16 January 2003
Dumb and Dumber," Top comedy
","Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are Harry and Lloyd, two complete nitwits who go cross-country to hand back a briefcase to Lauren Holly, who happens to be the object of Lloyd's affections.Brilliantly funny, it's one gag after another, but one of the highlights is when Jeff Daniels is forced to take a dump after being fed Turbo Laxative by Lloyd.See this today and laugh your socks off - top comedy from the Farrelly Brothers",Null,0,2,18 July 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Absolutely awesome
","Make no mistake - The Matrix is back big-time. OK, so it starts off a little slowly, building up the story with Zion, but as soon as Neo and the gang enter the Matrix, all hell breaks loose and we are treated to some truly astonishing special effects work, with mind-boggling fight scenes.Definitely worth watching - especially on the big screen, make sure you go to your local cinema and check this out now, you won't be disappointed!",10,0,0,22 May 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Almost as good as the First, but not quite
","Given the hyper surrounding this, after the phenomenally successful first film, it was always going to be tough expecting it to be as good as everybody wanted it to be.We all wanted to be blown away again - taken on that same journey that we experienced in the first film and unfortunately that cannot be the case since this is a sequel and thus not original like the first film.But, hats off to the Wachowski Brothers for creating another exciting roller-coaster ride with is pure entertainment from beginning to end. The special effects are even better this time round and the characters are developed alot further. We are also given teasing information on the construct of the Matrix, where it came from and how it all works.The film ends on yet another cliff-hanger, a perfect introduction to the final part of the trilogy (Matrix: Revolutions). The only problem with the film is the beginning - it seems to dwell for almost too long on Zion, before we get back to being in the Matrix where the action really kicks off. If they had shortened the first part, this would probably have been equal to the first film, but with it in, it does feel slightly laboured at points.Still one of the finest sci-fi actioners around and please do go and see it on a big screen to fully appreciate the action, but not quite up there with the original.",10,0,1,29 July 2003
It's a Wonderful Life," The Greatest Feel-Good Movie of them all!
","The greatest 'Feel-good' movie ever made and so much more beside. James Stewart gives the performance of his career in Capra's ode to the despair and triumph of humanity.This film is actually prescribed by Doctors to treat depression in certain areas and with good reason too. Bailey's descent into despair is a perfect analogy of modern depression and well, when he finally triumphs, the rush we as the audience receive is almost too much to take.I absolutely refuse anyone to sit and watch this without feeling emotionally overwhelmed by the end - not a dry eye in the house.Don't just think of this as some soppy Christmas movie to flick on TV, treat it as it should be treated, a serious film, with serious and powerful messages. Really a must for everyone.",Null,0,4,26 November 2003
A Beautiful Mind," Almost Brilliant
","A Beautiful Mind is a movie about the life of John Nash, a brilliant Mathematician who lectured at M.I.T. in between developing mind-bending theories. There was an awful lot of scope for the film to take in, a genius who virtually corrupted his own mind in pursuit of theorems that most of us will never understand. The film itself doesn't quite deliver in the way it could or should, but that's wholly understandable.It doesn't really touch on the elegance of mathematics at all but focuses more on Nash as a person as his increasingly schizophrenic condition. In this part, the film succeeds. Crowe gives an outstanding performance as Nash and Jennifer Connelly is excellent as his wife. It's a very emotive film and closer to the truth of the condition than most realise Â– for anyone who has suffered with mental ill health, one can appreciate some of the torment and turmoil that Nash goes through.Overall, a decent film, competently directed by Ron Howard, but as with virtually all of his films, it could have been so much more. It's one of those movies that almost achieves greatness, but falls short. It is an emotional saga and will no doubt illicit the odd tear from the audience, but as a story about one of the greatest mathematicians of last century it doesn't quite add up (pun intended).",Null,0,1,7 August 2003
The Shawshank Redemption," A Hymn to the Determination and Belief of Man
","A hymn to the determination and belief of man, 'Shawshank Redemption' truly deserves its place as the second best film made in the IMDB poll.How on Earth we all missed this one when it was at the cinema is truly baffling; but it has now gained the worldwide recognition it so richly deserves.Robbins is absolutely superb as Andy Dufresne and actually surpasses Freeman's performance (about the only actor to do this) as 'Red'. It's pointless describing the story, suffice to say that it stands head and shoulders above all other movies as a testament to the endurance and power of the human spirit, that almost no matter what situation we find ourselves in, we can endure and prevail. Incredible, thought-provoking and a cornerstone of modern day storytelling.",Null,0,0,26 November 2003
Speed," Watch it!
","It's simple - this is one of the finest action movies ever made. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock both hit the high-point of fame and rightly so, after excellent performances in this non-stop rollercoaster ride.Dennis Hopper is as reliable as ever as the villain, Jeff Daniels is good as Keanu's side-kick but the real winner here are the action set pieces which have to be seen to be believed ('there's a gap in the freeway'.. etc.)Terrific fun and extremely entertaining..Watch it!",Null,0,0,6 August 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Final Part actually surpasses the previous movies
","Simply put, this is about as good as it gets on the 'big screen'. Jackson is a true artist and blends a story so rich with characters and action that it's impossible not to get drawn into the film - the acting is excellent throughout and the battle scenes are just unbelievable. The only slight tarnish on this epic masterpiece is the ending which seems to drag a little; you keep expecting it to end and then another thing happens. Other than that, first class film-making.Some have said this is the best of the three and the film of the year. I don't agree - for my money, this is the film of the decade.",Null,0,0,2 January 2004
The Matrix," Pure class!
","So much has been said about this movie, it's hard to know where to begin. It's probably the best sci-fi actioner I've ever seen (better than Matrix: Reloaded) and that's mainly thanks to two vital ingredients - a very intriguing and original premise and some of the finest special effects ever committed to film.Keanu Reeves plays Neo and as the story unfolds, we follow his adventures into some truly mind-boggling situations and discover things as he discovers them.It's hipper than hip and cool as ice, I defy anybody not to enjoy at least some part of this film.It blows you away at the beginning and gets better and better right to the very end, ending on a perfect cliff-hanger.What is the Matrix? Well, in the words of Morpheus, 'no-body can be told what the Matrix is, you have to see it for yourself.'Pure class!",Null,0,1,29 July 2003
Gangs of New York," Could have been so much more...
","Gangs of New York is a fairly satisfying film. It is based in the 1800s and follows the plight of 'Amsterdam' from his early childhood to when he returns to New York as an adult to seek vengeance on 'Bill the Butcher' who'd slain his father many years before in a gang-fight.The performances are superb, especially Daniel Day-Lewis who pretty much steals the show as the nasty 'Bill the Butcher', leader of a gang called the 'Natives', whose sole aim is to rid New York of the influx of Irish immigrants.The big problem with the film is that you simply don't care about the characters, other than the three principal leads - Cameron Diaz, Leonardo DiCaprio and Daniel Day-Lewis. Thus when there's gangwarfare, it's very difficult to know quite who to root for or what's going on.The film doesn't really answer any questions and opens up many more possibilities than it achieves. This could have been a truly outstanding film, certainly there is enough scope and the look and feel of the 'Five Points' in the 1860s looks spot on. However, it falls short on character development.Overall, worth watching - be warned that it is fairly violent and bloody (typical Scorsese) but not the masterpiece it could have been.",9,0,0,14 July 2003
