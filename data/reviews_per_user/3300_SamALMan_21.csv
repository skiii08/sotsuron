Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," How about an actual person being a vampire hunter?
",Well.. I like the idea.. very intersting..but.. this movie presented the story in extremely rushed manner.. with so many characters that do not serve much to the plot.. and the main known events related to Abraham Lincoln were weaved with the vampires 'agenda'. Now.. what was so enjoyable in this movie?.. the action (even there was a scene that was ruined by very poor CGI).. it has a style (not unique but enjoyable).,2,1,2,24 August 2018
The Big Lebowski," Tangled Lebowski
","A care-free, broke, and calm Lebowski (the dude) get tangled with The Big wealthy Lebowski.. this is the story!! but then many sides used or took advantage of the poor care-free Lebowski who have friends that less to be said they raise the flames of the already lighted fire! .. It is funny and at some points hilarious. I didn't get the purpose of the few characters in the movie but in overall the few main characters (dude and his friends) were funny in their way of looking at things!.. I can't say that I enjoyed the whole movie but I can say that there are very few scenes that worth saving for repeat watch!!",3,2,7,26 July 2018
Passengers," Not usual romantic movie!
","It is a very enjoyable movie for its visuals, designs, and the reasonable plot to present it for audience as a not a usual but yet sweet romantic movie in an unusual setting.. If you look at it with expectation of believable reason why such a situation started and how it got continued then you will absolutely will get frustrated (there are few reasons presented in this movie for why the situation exist and continued). There are few 'adventures' scenes with nice visuals that can make this romantic movie little exciting... it is a romantic movie where couples can enjoy. This movie presented an unusual situation, we set back and see what the characters do in that situation. There is no need to look at different ways to approach the situation and also no need to explore the reasons of such situation exist.. that is all.",4,0,2,2 August 2018
The Impossible," Human strength in time of stress
",I have to say that I stopped watching movies on disasters as they were not representing anything new.. these type of movies concentrate on actors and the disaster happening and forget about the characters emotions. In this movie I would like to say that I really got scared for the characters but I didn't.. what I felt mostly is.. inspiration!!... the characters are not super-humans but they made me feel that they are...we are as human can be super in time of stress.. we can appreciate our existence in time of stress.. that what I could get to see in this movie.. Every time I feel weak.. I would like to turn into such productions like this movie to show me that no situation is hard to pass.. everything has an end.. even hard situations!It is typical tear-jerking movie..but presented in a best way to get you (inspired!).. I recommend watching it completely in one set and not dividing it so you do not lose that emotional connection with the characters.,5,0,1,19 June 2018
The Danish Girl," The girl
","I have to be honest, I do not know much about the identity struggle such the one 'Einar Wegener' suffered from.. but I can get glimpse of what that struggle would be through this movie. I can imagine it was a hard time for such identity crisis to rise up .. but even though the movie showed that there were open minded people that can accept differences around the year 1900 even if these people were few . (----------------This review has spoiler start here--------------)At the beginning of this movie 'Gerda Wegener' (wife of 'Einar Wegener') who was shown to be more bold than her husband, asked her husband to pose for a portrait as a woman and at that moment 'Einar' began to discover what is going on with 'him'.. the movie just present that self discovery and self awareness at the time where there were no one known before 'him' struggle the same. It is a story of 'Einar' getting bolder to be 'Lili' in a hard period of time.. There were few wondering questions during and after the movie finishes.. probably they came up because I do not fully understand the transformation (was it physically, mentally, and emotionally at once!?). It is a lovely movie to watch with parts of the true story of 'Lili Elbe' who was bold enough to accept performing the first gender-change operation to be fully 'her'.",3,3,4,15 July 2018
About Time," Life choices
","If you like movies evolve around time travel and events coherence then I can say that it might not represent what you expect. It is purely a cute romantic movie that includes some time travel as an extra element. I am a science fiction/time-travel and event coherence genre fan and I would like to say that I really liked this movie a lot. The acting cast were amazing and handling of scenes was perfect as there are no wasted moments and when I feel that there are extra scenes that serve no purpose to understand this movie, I get melted with these moments that build up the emotional connection.One of the best romantic time-travel involved movies. Not an ordinary romantic movie as it gives a clear message of what are life choices that impact the rest of our lives.. it is 'about' our life's 'time'.",5,2,4,17 June 2018
Ready Player One," Pop Culture References Movie
","What is fun about this movie?... the visuals and all the pop culture references.. you might will have the eager to re-watch just to catch what you missed the first time. The plot is not unique and few scenes were rushed, but the presentation is amazing. I didn't read the book but heard that it is different from this movie and I hope it gave more background story to the main characters as what was given in this movie was a shell for most characters. The main message that can be obtained from this movie is easily understood. It is definitely worth the time for watching at least one time (maybe re-watching just to catch what you missed the first time you watched!).",3,0,2,15 July 2018
The Hateful Eight," Long introduction then a mystery starts (for short time!)
",I saw this movie recently after a recommendation.. I didn't know what is about except it is in the old west during winter with characters that seems to be rough!!So.. Almost two third of the movie was an introduction to most of the characters.. some of them were little easy to understand or at least with obvious and clear intentions.. the others were not easy to pick up what their intentions.. that introduction was slow and detailed a little. Afterward things escalated for short time and then a slow reveal of a main mystery (that the viewer might not aware of!!) that used pieces of information that the viewer wasn't aware of as well or easy to miss in long dialogues.. at the end there was an extreme tension and the viewer will make speculations (even after the movie finishes!). It is a enjoyable movie to watch (and hear!). The capture of the winter atmosphere was superb (but most of the scenes were inside a cabin).. and the main acting staff were a core attraction for this movie for their capabilities to show us the essence of the characters before the clear reveal of every one's intention. The plot wasn't hard to absorb but the long dialogues can make some viewers lose interest and focus as most of the fast and light action happen near the end of the movie!,3,3,4,26 July 2018
District 9," Why this movie is enjoyable?
","I have to say that at first time I saw the aliens in this movie, I wondered why did I got excited for it!!As a science fiction movies fan, I would say that I liked it. It have all the reasonable factors that makes it a good sci-fi movie.. which is presentation of an unusual phenomena or event or whatever it could be and then the viewer should sit back and watch the effects of it with minimal predictable 'smart' interference that usually found in sci-fi movies. This movie is not about aliens.. it is about humans. The aliens are just means to describe human behaviors. Most movies that involve alien race presence would of course showcases human behaviors toward the unknown.. but here and in this movie the aliens are not 'unknown'. For some reason an obviously more technically advanced alien race got 'trapped' on earth. Up to almost half the movie run time, the presentation of aliens was through TV reports and interviews that documents the life of aliens in the restricted slum-like area after so many years on earth. On the second half of the movie run time, that's when the enjoyable part start.. the sympathy toward the aliens reflected back to be a sympathy toward human race for its cruelty and selfishness. I would recommend this movie to every science fiction genre fan.",5,2,3,12 May 2018
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Charming and entertaining
",This movie is a story told by one of the fictional characters that is in a fictional country and lives in fictional hotel. The scenes were just jumps in the story but comes in the appropriate order.. The characters do not tell jokes BUT the ordinary and sometimes the not so ordinary behavior the characters do that make it funny along with the an unexpected sequence of events. This movie is so colorful with clear spoken language and shot in attractive way.,6,0,0,24 July 2018
It Follows," Intersting!
",The trailer made the movie look interesting and it is indeed interesting. Horror movie with teenagers that really act as teenagers. The 'thing' that follow by the end of movie was not explained except that I got ideas about what it could be. Camera handling and suspense made it worth the time.,2,1,5,27 May 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," I am not disappointed and the main character is memerable!
","I am not a comic fan.. I never read printed materials on infinity war and now after watching this movie I feel if I have the chance to read it, I will.Anyway.. the movie started where one of the most recent Marvel studio movies ended, Thanos is on quest to collect all the infinity stones to proceed with his plan and while doing so he faces opposition attempts by the avengers and others.You will definitely feel shaken by the first scene in this movie and the shock won't wear out by that scene.. Thanos is determined to collect all the infinity stones even the one that is unknown whereabouts to Marvel movies fans to fulfill his aim.. the aim that made his quest to collect infinity stones understood and analyzed. It hold a real nice philosophical thought that really worth all the time to analyze. The visuals were amazing in this movie, specially for Thanos and the new characters. You can read emotions better on the main 'computer constructed' character, they are very close to the emotions that you may be able to read from human real face. It is a fast based movie with few 'quiet' scenes and short scenes with slight laughs here and there to lighten the mood. The characters who appear in this movie have varied screen time but it is noticeable even when some characters get longer screen time, they do not overshadow the efforts of other characters that have lesser screen time. The movie is definitely aiming to please group of audience that appreciate certain types of jokes and references. ********** SPOILER Begin**************
There were no introduction to Thano's snap.. by looking back at Thano's reasons to kill people, I never find it connected to the moment where he snapped his fingers.. he snapped as a impulse or reaction to an avenger attack.. his reasons where corrupted by emotions!.. but definitely showing that Thanos would do anything to have this power in his collection. 
********** SPOILER end**************Marvel studios started a huge project with multiple layers and stages that will make it impossible to wrap it as a perfect project.. you will definitely see slips here and there specially when the other Marvel studios productions seemed connected to this movie. At the end I would say that this movie is more suitable to young audience (to me 40 years and younger). Comics started as a 'relief' and ended to be an 'art'.. This movie is one of the good examples of a nice modern comic movie.",4,21,41,9 May 2018
Ex Machina," An expected social experiment scenario
",The movie displays one scenario of a social experiment involves the use of artificial intelligence (A.I.).. it tries to find out what if a machine with A.I. would behave at certain situation toward human being.. we already know that humans are emotional but are the machines also 'emotional'? that what you expect to understand from this movie.It starts with Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) getting an invitation to Nathan's (Oscar Isaac) house. Nathan is known to be the smartest man who started the advanced A.I. machines. Caleb was invited to the strangely isolated house to test a newly developed A.I. machine. For now everything looks good except that Nathan's paranoia behavior started to rise up toward Caleb and Caleb started to suspect the sanity of Nathan's by the help of the newly developed A.I. machine... the end will be a surprise because the end is the one that will make you think about how a machine with A.I. would behave at certain situation toward human being. The end made me scared a little just by the thought it implanted in my head.I believe the whole staff put their heart in this project that really did not disappoint me.. The movie need patience. The movie might be accepted by science fiction fans from both types of science (natural and social).,5,2,3,26 May 2018
The Adjustment Bureau," The adjustment team
","'The adjustment team' is the title of a short story by the author Philip K. Dick.. science fiction story about a world where changes or adjustments in people's lives are made by a team called 'the adjustment team'.. There was an unfortunate one person who witnessed the change and promised to be kept unchanged only if he do not tell any one about what he saw.. so he tried to do so and 'the adjustment team' helped him to keep him away from telling anybody about it.. the endNow for this movie... the main core idea is there but with extension to what our protagonist is about, where substantial time spent to showcase his career life and his love life.. it is basically a romantic movie with a slight portion of science fiction and some thrill included. The short story was good, straightforward, and into the point.. while this movie uses the main core idea from Philip K. Dick, it does not give the same satisfaction as the short story does.",1,0,2,16 August 2018
The Shape of Water," A fairy tale for adults
","A movie on a love story.. fairy tale 'like' love story. Lot of things do not look logical but so in 'fairy tales'. A creature of an unknown origin was found and transferred to a government owned facility where the protagonist 'Elisa' work as a cleaner.. she got interested when her eyes fell on the new creature (like she do with many things she faced in her life as the movie shows). She wasn't shown as weak woman, but clever and innocent.. but even though it was shown also that women in the 60s are silenced in addition of her's. She has friends that also share with her the forced silence in community.. she recently meet a new friend that will join the group if she does not intervene, and that's what she did.. she did what it seems to be right.I love the group of actors and actresses in this movie, they delivered a very realistic feeling (even though some actions were not realistic!). The set and the visuals effects were superb and these were the main attractions for this movie for me. I would say that the expected simple actions or responds were really absent from this movie..most of the characters surprise me with their responds except for (Sally Hawkins) and (Michael Stuhlbarg) where their characters showed reasonable responds to situations. This movie reminds me of the fairy tale (the little mermaid) but with some twist (this twist won't be understood until the end of the movie!).",3,0,6,24 July 2018
The Conjuring," Approperiate staff makes the movie stands up among others in same genre
","James Wan and his colleagues staff managed to make this movie unique among other horror movie. I believe if any member in this movie could be replaced then it would get different degree of excitement from audience (possibly less than what this movie got!). It is expected paranormal based story but done with unique style, there wasn't a rely on sex, gore, and long unnecessary dialogues to (fill-up!!) the movie but it is a pure build-up and into the point sequence of events. There are two paranormal investigators in 1970's who help a family with their haunted house.. very easy and expected plot but yet enjoyable to watch.. why is that?... is it the pacing, is it the suspense, or is it camera handling, or other factors.. maybe all of them!!.. I have to say the ending came little off for me, so that might affected the rating!!This movie deserves watching for horror fans and extremely suggested for non-horror fans who want to be introduced properly to the genre!",4,0,2,28 June 2018
Black Panther," Cultural Super Hero Movie
","The description of this movie on IMDB.com summarize the movie. The movie is a cultural enjoyable journey of a super hero.(Black Panther) the character caught my eyes first time in 'captain America: civil war' movie, his agility like a panther got me excited to see more of him in this movie. The most of the this movie showcases African visually stunning culture -which I didn't mind watching - and few of modern references specially in US. There are times I felt that I've been taken away by the visual effects, the set, and the music and forgot to concentrate on the movie plot it self. I will try to be fair as possible as I can.. This movie begins where 'captain America: civil war' ended, the Wakanda throne is going to be taken by the elder son of the previous king 'black panther' and little less than third of this movie given to this portion then a threat to Wakanda must be dealt with by the newly crowned king as of his new duties as king 'black panther'.. conflict of the many tribes ruled by the Wakanda's king wasn't raised until the new king arrived and with the new threat, that put lot of responsibilities on the new king.. very simple and straight forward story line but with an addition to a super powered king and country that posses advanced technology that no one have on earth. Simple plot with most expected spectrum of emotions and enjoyable action and humor.",5,1,1,14 May 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Enjoyable title with no expectations
","First time I watched this movie I loved the sound track, the sound effects, and the look of everyone in justice league that appeared in this movie. Second time I watched I got my notebook with me to write what I notice to remember what I watched, as it is dense but simple .. I loved the overall result of this movie. My rating 5/10 is from my first viewing of the movie and that means the movie impacted me in some way I wasn't sure how but I can watch it several times before getting bored .. from the second viewing I connected some of the pieces (there are still questions that I didn't find answers to for the choices the production staff made in this movie). Last time I read DC comic book was around 15 years ago, hence I cannot say that I know better on comics and that is why I like this movie, I did not expect I was open to see new 'DC' flavored Superman and Batman (and the other justice league members in this movie) in such an enjoyment.Now from now on I will mention some SPOILERS:<ul><li>Alfred said (during his first appearance in this movie) 'The fever, the rage, the feeding of powerlessness .. that turns good men cruel' and I believe that could be a description of Lex Luthor (even though he wasn't addressed during conversation with Bruce Wayne).. Lex Luthor appeared as a clever, twisted, and wicked being became as he is because of his father. - First time Lex Luthor introduced in the movie he was wearing a shirt with a picture of monkey with a detonator on the front and on the back of the shirt there was 3 bananas tied up with the other end of the detonator. That shirt by itself say something about the mentality of Lex Luthor in this movie. - Lex Luthor knew who is Superman all the way from the beginning (after Superman got introduced to mankind) as he was working on something called 'meta-human thesis' .. and from the scene in the reception party where he got excited for being there when Clark Kent meet Bruce Wayne I believe he knew also who is Batman. - Bruce Wayne sometime after the incident of Superman with general Zod, got a 'rage and fever' on Superman and got 'feed with powerlessness feeling' that made him at some point 'plan' to fight with Superman using a weapon Lex Luthor has, Lex wasn't surprised or mad when it got stolen from him and that could mean something. - Superman appears in this movie as a person who doesn't know how he can be accepted and the people in his life (Lois and Martha) get him in the right track to do good instead of harm. - While Batman and Superman fighting, Superman collected his fist in a form similar to that formed by Bruce's father when he was protecting his family .. so at this time it seems Superman knew what he should do to protect his loved ones. In overall I loved how they introduced Lex Luthor as a twisted mind that took advantage of bad events (even causing few) to get rid of those who are superior to his and to gain power in his life and not be under a powerful being. He 'plan' to get rid of Superman in a way later Batman got into picture and Lex took advantage of him to be his tool to wipe out Superman by using a newly discovered weapon. Lex messed up in a way he 'rang' the bells for evil to come. By seeing this craziness and discovering more people of super powers, Batman decided by the end of the movie to unite forces to be able to defeat future threats (such the one they faced) and these events were the cause of forming the justice league (according to this movie). The introduction of flash, aqua- man, and cyborg beside wonder woman was good to me and enjoyable. The presentation of Batman and Lex Luthor was amazing to me. Superman was good but I couldn't grab much of him in this movie. I tried to pour my thoughts in an organized manner, I hope I did (even though I know I didn't). It is a movie that worth watching as it is enjoyable for the story line (even there are some choices I don't understand how they could add anything to the story) and the acting. If you like comic presentation of characters, then you may enjoy this movie.</li></ul>",5,0,2,22 May 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Force Awakend
","I have to note first that my rating 4/10 means the movie is great and can be watched several times before getting bored.Who ever watched the original 'star wars' would know the meaning of every detail in this movie however there are some decisions made for this movie that are not related to the original story more than the circumstances and 'requirements' for the workers on this film.<ul><li>It has a humor. - Majority of the new cast were chosen perfectly for their roles. - For fans of original star wars movie, the second the old case of star wars appear on screen is memorable and amazing.</li></ul>To my understanding, 'the force awaken' hold a lot of meanings to it.This is a useless review but I have to write it.",4,11,22,20 December 2015
Her," A soft romantic and social drama movie
","This movie discusses aches of the heart in relationship , what true relationship is, and what true partner is. I loved the emotional performance of Joaquin Phoenix. It is a slow movie with enjoyable scenery and atmosphere. The artificial Intelligence (A.I.) once again employed to explore human emotions and social bonds in a new way.It is a soft social romantic/drama movie. It might won't impress all science fiction fans but it presents a kind of 'realistic' path of what our technology today would lead to.",4,0,0,27 May 2018
Alien: Covenant," Do not hold straight answers..but in overall it is exciting
",I do not remember an enjoyment of watching Alien franchise movie beside Alien original motion picture more than this movie. It has the characters and elements that can capture you for some reason.This movie keeps you wonder and think about motives and make you try to link things up specially it is meant to be part of Alien franchise movies.The movie starts with an accident in the ship that makes crew members awake after long hibernation. They found by chance a planet that could be promising as a colony location for human race. The surprising thing is that the new captain decides to 'discover' this planet even they have an already planned route to other 'discovered' planet to be habitat for human race and he has responsibility to transfer the colonies on board to safe and secured planet. The 'discovery' team land on 'undiscovered' planet to be surprised and that what makes the movie a little bit exciting to watch. It starts with stupid decision to end up revealing few things after the end event of Prometheus movie.,4,3,9,2 June 2017
