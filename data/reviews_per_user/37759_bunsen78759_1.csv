The Ring," Very scary but unresolved
","I have read that this movie combines elements of horror and mystery, and I couldn't agree more. But while films like 'Dead Ringers' and 'Seven' very capably bridge the gap between mystery and horror, this movie doesn't entirely do so.This is not to say it wasn't captivating, scary, interesting or well- filmed. It was most definitely all these. But it presented many complications- physical, psychological and (particularly) supernatural, ( to its credit, a massive number of complications) and then all but seemed to forget about them in the end. Then, it appeared to use the explanation that it was a horror flick to back out of any need to provide true explanations of the many issues it originally raised(it does provide only one, and that one is inadequate to resolve the movie).Nonetheless, it was very enjoyable to watch. It was suspenseful, downright scary, and extremely disturbing. But do not expect that well, the expectations the movie sets up in the first third of the movie will actually be resolved, as they won't.Finally, this movie is rated PG-13, which I found awfully disturbing. I wouldn't let your nine year old go by him or herself; place the emphasis on the parental guidance part of this rating.**.5 out of ****",Null,0,0,20 October 2002
