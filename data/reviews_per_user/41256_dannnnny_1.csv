The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Horrible, dreadfully written dross.
","Really dreadful horrible shoddy movie with awkward platitudes and questionable morals. I went to see it for free and I still feel cheated. Went with a group of about 8 and the only good thing we could say about it between us was that it would make other films appear better.The story jumps from unexplained and unexpanded disaster to disaster, not dwelling or addressing any of the issues but simply providing lip service to everything that could possibly go awry in a life, in the process creating characters that you can't begin to feel any empathy for as they are simply not believable.The script writing was abysmal, I'll admit we laughed, but the tears were of pain and the laughs were awkward and well and truly AT and in pity of everyone associated with this train crash.",1,30,77,4 October 2012
