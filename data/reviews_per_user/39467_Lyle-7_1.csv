The Blair Witch Project," Film students, try to forget!
","I am not exactly a film student (English major, but I have taken film classes), but I saw this flick with one last night.  The theater was packed, and everyone seemed to be having a better time than us.  The chills were clever and intense, but we both spent too much time concentrating on how the film must have been made.  I wish I had been as scared as the girl who left the theater in front of us, as she wiped tears from her eyes.That said, the last four minutes of this movie prompted me to sleep with the lights on for the first times in my nineteen years on this planet.So, please, film students, shed your cynical, Louis-Malle-is-God mentality, and allow this movie to envelope and terrify you.",9,1,2,19 July 1999
