The Blair Witch Project," Excellent film
","This is one of the scariest and most original movies I have ever seen.  The concept is both interesting and terrifying, and the horror that the actors experience is made very real to the audience because of the novel use of hand-held cameras to tell the story.  By all means, see this one: the ending alone will keep you awake at night.",9,1,1,31 July 1999
