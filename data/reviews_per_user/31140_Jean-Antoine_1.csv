Requiem for a Dream," Masterpiece
","What a masterpiece! The acting was so amazing as it was from Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and especially Ellen Burstyn. I just loved it! The emotions were so strong and it was so realistic!
The music suited perfectly to the movie.
I think this movie would be a great prevention against drugs, as we see how a couple get destroyed; how a mother keeps living in her dark crazy world, obsessed by the idea of being a TV star, but finally ends in a mental hospital; and how a lonely guy who is fighting for his life finds himself devastated by drugs all around him.
In the end it was a great work by Darren Aronofsky. I really enjoy his movies by the way he insists on the psychological aspects of the protagonists.",10,1,2,23 September 2013
