Vertigo," Hitchcocks most boring among his 'classics'
","I love North by Northwest, Birds and Psycho.But Vertigo is too long and too boring.The story in it self is interesting enough but it should have been at least half an hour shorter. Especially because the ending (Judy and the Madeleine is the same person) is obvious from the moment he knocks on her door. Also why would they pull off a staged suicide that well and she would be dumb enough to stay in the city in the exact same room? Why didn't they just made it seem like the wife was murdered and frame John for the murder? How can John just leave a place where he's been committed? And most importantly: why did Hitchcock insist on using crappy studio shots for almost every outdoor location, whenever the actors were talking?? This actually annoyed me so much that I had a hard time concentrating on enjoying the movie!! Even in 1958 those awful background matte paintings must have looked so fake. Or the scene in the forest or by the ocean or the bay where it's all studio shots!! Or the night painting of the city in Midges apartment!! Or every shot of an actor driving with a fake background in the rear window.It seems profoundly stupid, when they had already shot a lot outside!! I just don't get why???",1,19,32,19 February 2016
The Incredible Hulk," Almost as bad as Ang Lees version
","Again it is beyond me, how poor taste in movies the users of IMDb, truly has. I did'nt like this movie very much. Maybe because I think The Hulk is probably the dumbest superhero ever made. A man that turns into a 10 feet tall green monster with an iq smaller than Homer Simpsons, whenever he gets angry. Its completely ridiculous. I hated the 2003 version and the only reason I wanted to see this was because of Edward Norton. I've always considered him one of the greatest actors of his generation. Unfortunately that does'nt show in this movie. Because Norton has so little to work with. He does'nt have many lines as Bruce Banner. Whenever he is not replaced by the cgi-Hulk, he is on the run. It's a very physical role and its disappointing, because it makes it hard to care about him. Tim Roths character is annoying and stupid and his motivation for hating Banner/Hulk is never explained. He just seems like a psychopath hellbent on killing Banner/Hulk. The general is frigging annoying too and his lack of compassion for Banner gives him almost no credibility at all. There are only two good things about this movie: the effects and the gorgeous Liv Tyler. And speaking of her, they even managed to ruin what could have been a love making scene with nudity from Tyler, because Banner can't even get sexily aroused without turning into The brain-dead Hulk. Some Marvel comics are just too dumb to be made into movies. The fantastic four is one of them, Hulk is another one.",1,17,36,30 June 2008
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Complete let-down on Blu-ray
","I've always thought of The Phantom Menace as an awful movie that does'nt work on any level. Not for kids and not for adults. And the acting is of course awful as well. But now all 6 movies have finally been released on Blu-ray and that is not a good thing for the prequels.Everything in the prequels is cgi, even some of the characters and almost every background. And it looks so fake. Especially Yoda. Whenever he is in the frame with real actors, he looks so bad. I liked him more as a puppet in the old movies.And the old movies might have been primitive and the first one even low budget, but everything looked better. Everything was more dirty and seemed more real. Alien characters were played by real actors in make-up and the ships were models and they looked more convincing than the cgi ships in the new movies. Everything looks like a computer game in the new movies.If you happen to actually like the prequels and you have them on DVD, don't replace them with Blu-ray. They actually lookee better in lower resolution.",Null,0,3,19 September 2011
The Expendables 2," Best violent action in 10 years
","They don't make them like this anymore. After the PG13 snooze fests such as The Dark knight rises and the even more awful bloodless humorless remake of Total Recall and all the bloodless superhero movies that is mostly cgi and the boring bloodless Bourne movies, it is nice with some old school action with some real ass kicking where people actually bleed and stabbing and blowing limbs off is allowed. That combined with big explosions, Sly, Arnie and Bruce standing together and literally blowing people to bits, funny oneliners and great humor in the few scenes without action, makes The Expendables 2 R-rated fun at its best.The only letdown is JCVD as the badguy. He was a disappointment. Even his fancy kicking wasn't as good as in Universal Soldier etc. They should have found a better actor for the part of Villain, yeah that's his characters name.",Null,1,8,5 September 2012
Skyfall," Skyfail!! Fire Daniel Craig!!
","I think what I hate most about this insult to the Bond franchise, is the critics bull-crap about this being the best Boind movie ever. Have all critics been paid off by the Bond people to write such positive reviews?I cannot find a single negative review of Skyfall written by a professional movie-critic anywhere online. It's either that or that the critics are to spineless to say anything bad about this atrocity of a movie.This is NOT Bond!! It's depressing, ugly looking, ugly shot, Daniel Craig looks too old for the part.There are no Bond-babes, no exotic locations, no gadgets, no jokes, the villain is pathetic, there are major plot-holes. The same can be said about The Dark Knight rises, which Sam Mendes was inspired by.How about being original for a change? These days all movies have to look a like.Only good thing about the movie: M dies!! Daniel Craig has ruined Bond. Fire that grumpy old-looking ugly guy whose face and nasty blue eyes is best for villain parts anyway and find a 30 year old dark haired good-looking guy who can play Bond the way Bond should be played.",1,58,108,2 December 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," And yet another sequel made only to make more money
","I hate this movie as well as the third installment. The plot is non-existent. Jack Sparrow is too goofy and have almost no serious scenes in the entire film. And I hate that they bring back Captain Barbossa in the end. He was a great villain in the first one but why the hell bring him back when we got new villains?? He's character played it self out in the first movie and should'nt have been brought back.Gore Verbinski should be ashamed for agreeing to make sequels without something called decent scripts.I can't blame Johnny Depp, for signing on for sequels, as he had a lot of fun on the first film and probably was given a lot of money for the sequels. And Depp has always made weird movies his entire career, so he is probably not very well paid.Just like with the Matrix sequels, pretend the sequels don't exist and just enjoy the original movie, which is truly a masterpiece.",1,3,4,27 March 2008
The Babadook," Truly terrifying
","Truly scary horror-movies come with years apart. Most of them are crap.But The Babadook is the scariest movie I've seen since Insidious, which I remember as just as scary. And a good horror movie has to be so scary that you never wanna see it again.Babadook is just that.I won't give much away, except to say that it starts with a disturbing pop out children's book called Mr. Babadook. But it's not just a book.Babadook is real.And it's scary as hell.I know this is an unusual review, but I really don't wanna ruin the movie by giving away too much of the plot.I will just say this: do not watch this alone.Best horror movie in a very long time.",10,3,5,17 September 2015
Spider-Man 2," The worst of The Spiderman movies
","For some reasons, superhero-comics turned into movies are always done by directors, that take the subject way too seriously. Which means way, way too much talk and way way too little action. Which is the main problem with Spiderman 2. Nothing works in this way too long movie with so many moral talks and lessons to be learned, that me and my buddy stopped counting after the annoying Aunt May gives Parker lesson number 30 about always doing the right thing. We both felt like throwing up. The best thing about the third installment, besides from the added and constant actionscenes is definitely that Aunt May is only in one scene. Lets hope they kill off her character in the fourth movie.The biggest problem is the geeky dork Tobey Maguire. He is just so annoying and has the most annoying face and he is character is so clumsy and always screws up whenever he is not in his Spiderman suit. And Peter Parker in the comic books are taller than Tobey, better looking and not that much a dork.The scene in the beginning, why does Parker ride around delivering pizza's on his crappy scooter, when he is Spiderman?? Why is he so obsessed with MJ played by the unattractive bad actress Kirsten Dunst, when he could get laid all the time as Spiderman?? And why doesn't he sleep with his landlords daughter who is clearly into him?? The part where he loses his powers is dumb and unnecessary and happens at a point in the movie, were there has been almost no action at all, and we had just watched Parker screw everything up for himself for about an hour. Not to mention all the constant scenes with his Aunt May.The villain is dumb and pathetic and badly played by Alfred Molina. And definitely the worst villain in all the movies. And the scene with the train, is the only big actionscene in the entire film. Not acceptable in an 'actionmovie' like Spiderman.The scenes between Parker and Harry where Harry blames Spiderman for his fathers (wonderfully played by Willem Defoe) death in the first movie, doesn't work. And when he finds out that Peter is Spiderman a real confrontation is not allowed in the horrible script, because the annoying MJ has to be rescued once again.The scene where Harry finds The Green Goblins equipment and suit should have been the final scene if you ask me, but no Sam Raimi had to add one last nauseating scene where MJ runs away from her own wedding and into the arms of Parker. Probably one of the worst endings in movie history.Fortunately the third movie has all the things that this lousy sequel builds up to for nearly two hours but never follows up on. Lots of action and a a selfish mean Spiderman and more violence.Lets hope they fire the entire cast for a fourth movie and find better actors that are better looking and give it a higher rating. Like 16 or 18, so we can have even darker movies than the excellent third installment. I read that Leonado DiCaprio turned down playing Spiderman. Lets hope he changed his mind if a fourth movie becomes a reality.How great could these films have been with him. He is handsome and a far better actor than the short annoying dork: Tobey Maguire.This movie gets zero stars from me.",1,4,11,10 March 2008
127 Hours," 127 Hours sucks!!
","Warning: this movie is boring and it will tick you off and put you to sleep.Plot.Moron goes hiking in the mountains without a cell-phone, without a GPS, without telling anyone where he's going. But he remembers a digital camera and a video-camera that apparently has enough battery-power to last 127 hours. He gets trapped in a canyon when he's arm is crushed under a big rock. After 127 hours he cuts his arm off.This movie is pointless and boring and a piece of trash and not the masterpiece people make it out to be. It's not a movie about survival and the guy is NOT a hero. This is a guy that left everything back home, including his brain. And it's not a miracle that he survived, more, just dumb luck. Avoid this snooze-fest even on TV.",1,59,113,9 March 2011
Terminator Salvation," PG13 is not even this movies biggest problem
","The one thing I feared the most when Salvation came out was the PG13 rating. I am sick of greedy producers, turning adult franchises, kiddie-friendly, just so they can sell more tickets. They ruined Die Hard 4 and Indiana Jones 4, with this ridiculous rating, that Spielberg should apologize for.However they really pushed the limit within this rating, with Salvation. It is pretty violent. But there is still no blood and they are still not allowed to say the f-word. I will never understand the double standard when it comes to American censorship. It's okay to show people having their necks broken or being choked to death as long as there is no blood and no nudity. And nobody says the oh so horrible f-word.But the rating is not the biggest problem here. The problem is Mcg, Bale and a really dumb script.Why they chose Mcg as a director (for god sakes, use your full name, if you wanna be in the big league, you're not a black rapper) is beyond me. The man has musicvideoes, Charlies Angels and episodes of Supernatural on his resume. Not exactly impressive. Cameron should never have signed off on the rights to the franchise. Mcg, tries his best, but he has several problems, Bale can't act. He is the most overrated actor of his generation. Both Edward Furlong and Nick Stahl, did a ten times better job, portraying John Connor. All Bale does is fight and yell and scream. He shows no depth, no emotions, we really don't care what happens to him. And I rooted for Marcus Wright in the end, not John Connor.And the script oh my god... first of all, what the hell happened to Marcus, in the 15 years that went by since they turned him into an infiltrator?? That is never explained. If he was being used to get to John Connor and Kyle Reese why did'nt they activate him sooner? Why does it come as a surprise to Connor that Marcus is a cyborg? He has met Terminators twice before in his life? Reese says in the first movie: 'you stay down by day, you can move around at night, but you still have to be careful, because the H.K's use infrared.' In this future the resistance move around in broad daylight, there are no battlefields with skulls on the ground and cars with skeletons inside. They have no ray-guns or other futuristic weapons.But they have military-choppers that look too new, they even have a submarine. Where would they get that kind of stuff in the middle of a nuclear war that has destroyed everything? In flashes of the future in the first movie they live underground in bunkers. Here they have a hanger and camps like in Iraq and Afghanistan. Where they can be killed anytime by H.K's and terminators. But apparently terminators only appear in this future, when the resistance play music. Yeah that makes a lot of sense.They eat coyotes and they have milk. Would'nt all animal-life have been wiped out in a nuclear-war?? Don't even get me started on the cgi-Arnold.The little brat: Star, has no lines and there is no point of her being in this movie.Bryce Dallas Howard is ugly, she's a bad actress, and her role in this movie is pointless. On top of that she spent the entire movie, looking pregnant, but it's never explained if she is pregnant. In Rise of the machines Kate was fighting side by side with John. Here she is reduced to being a doctor who is never in the field with Connor. And there is no chemistry what so ever between her and Bale.Moon Bloodgood (is that a real name?) as Williams is annoying and her relationship with Marcus is pointless as it never evolves anyway.The only two people that gives good performances are Sam Worthington and Anton Yelchin as Marcus and Reese. Especially Yelchin acts a lot like Biehn did in the first movie. He has potential to become a great actor. And Worthington should have played Connor. The actionscenes are great though and I love all the new terminators.But it is a PG13 future. Had the movie been R-rated like the previous films, it would have been a completely different film.But without a decent script, decent acting, a good story with heart and soul and humour and loalty to the flashes of the war in the previous movies, even an R-rating, would'nt have saved this sinking ship. And in the end when they blow up Skynet, as easy as boiling an egg and kill the only interesting character: Marcus and Connor gives his tenth speech, you realize that the franchise has been ruined for good.",4,5,8,20 December 2009
Insomnia," Robin Williams is a total miscast
","This movie might have been good, if they hadnt cast Robin Williams as the killer. Robin Williams is completely unbelievable as a killer. The fact that he walks around with a silly smile on his face during the entire film makes it hard to believe him.When, he tells an excellent Al Pacino how it changed him to kill someone and later on tells him why he killed the girl I could give a rats ass. I dont for a second believe that he killed her. He just looks too much like a nice guy. And he never acts cold or seem dangerous. Not one time in the movie is he scary.This movie is way too long and the ending is very predictable. Hilary Swank is gorgeous and sexy, which is a nice change, compared to her previous roles. She also acts well. So does the girl who works at the hotel.Everybody else in the film is superficial and dont support the story in anyway. Pacinos partner Hap is a scumbag from the beginning and you dont even feel sorry for him when he dies.The town in the film is an excact copy of Twin Peaks, without the scary atmosphere, the show had.Another thing is, why didnt Pacino just kill Williams right away? That way, he would have solved his problems. And we didnt have to waste two hours of boredom, waiting for Williams whiny, pathetic killer to die.
Why everybody thinks Wiliams is so great, is just beyond me.
They should have cast Edward Norton as the killer instead. He can at least act and look scary when he needs to. He can be dangerous.Williams is just ridicoulus. He should stick to comedies and stay away from roles he clearly cant handle.",Null,0,1,23 November 2002
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Even worse than the first Hellboy
","I hate those weird creatures. There are more creatures than humans in this garbage, the story suck, the jokes are not funny and the special effects are awful. I hate the worlds, Del Toro creates. Oh and the ending, where Liz is pregnant with Hellboy's child. It was just pathetic and stupid. Oh look this red freak from hell and this mutant-reject from X Men are gonna live happily ever after and have a hideous child together. The only comic adaptation worse than this, is The Spirit. Do not watch this movie, not even if you can watch it for free.Del Toro should be kicked out of Hollywood and go back home to Spain to make his weird little movies full time. People who like this movie and the bad cheap looking special effects as well as the first Hellboy, should go see a doctor.",1,6,13,28 July 2009
Black Mass," Why Black Mass and Depp sucks
","Sure, Johnny Depp is almost unrecognizable and sinister and creepy as the real life gangster James Whitey Bulger.But he is not creepy enough. He never seems out of control and totally insane like Heath Ledger's joker in The Dark Knight.It's not just that Depp is unlikeable, he's suppose to be unlikeable, its more the fact that there isn't a single likable character in the movie.Joel Edgerton ticked me off from the moment he appeared in the movie. He looked constipated and fat. And not once was he not wearing a suit where even his neck was covered by the collar of his shirt. I hated his suits and his big hair. Like everyone else in the movie he was scum.The movie is in general depressing and boring. As bad as Good Fellas, which in my opinion is one of the crappiest and most overrated gangster movies ever made.And I love good gangster movies like Donnie Brasco, another gangster movie with Depp where he is so much better. Or The Untouchables or Scarface. Masterpieces within their genre.This could have been an interesting movie if Depp have had the guts to play Bulger like a complete psycho. Like Al Pacino in Scarface. Sure he kills several people violently, but even that is done boring. If there had been even one character worth rooting for it could also have improved the movie.Black Mass is one cliché after another and it goes completely by the book as far as gangster movies go which unfortunately makes it very very boring.",1,6,13,18 December 2015
Shutter Island," Boring and pretentious
","I usually have nothing against being influenced by a movie if it appeals to me and has a good story. Shutter Island did neither for me.The music in the opening scene is trying way too hard to create an eerie feeling that Shutter Island is a place of evil. And the music reminded me of Cape Fear. But Shutter Island is far far from the greatness of Cape Fear which is Scorses all time masterpiece in my opinion. This however is his worst movie.It is not DiCaprio's fault, but the horrible deeply flawed screenplay.* SPOILER AHEAD * I would have liked to have Leo's character not been insane and developed an alternative reality in order to protect himself from the memory of his drowned children and the wife that he shot.If the movie had been about him coming to find a missing patient and expose Ben Kingsley and the other doctors as vicious attackers of patients, then it had perhaps been a good movie.Teddy's memories of WWII is also just boring and have no great importance to the plot. Yes I know that the dead girl in wagons represent his daughter that he could not save. But it's damn uninteresting.The plot does not make much sense either. Leo is really a patient himself on Shutter Island, and to get him to accept his past, all physicians, psychiatrists, prison guards and patients are acting to support his idea of reality. How likely is it that doctors could get criminally insane to help in this way? It would not be feasible. They are all just as crazy as Teddy. If not more.How likely is it that a German doctor could get Teddy to wake up when Teddy, because of his past as a soldier, hates Germans and basically sees him as a Nazi? They offer Teddy alcohol. It would probably just be tea they had given him had he said yes but he would probably have noticed it. And then what would they have done? If the goal is to get Teddy to accept his past and that he is patient, why are the doctors then doing everything they can to act suspicious and untrustworthy? What if Teddy had bolted when he was aboard the ferry with his partner/psychiatrist? It could not have been prevented.How likely is it that the U.S. Marshalls are told to hand over their weapons when they are searching for a missing patient in a prison/institution for the criminally insane?Teddy's gun is a toy gun. How likely is it that Teddy does not until the very end discovers that it is made of plastic, not metal and wood? Especially when he is suppose to be extremely intelligent.On the whole, they let a seemingly very dangerous patient walk freely around the island for several days. They let him blow up a car and knock a guard out. They would never let it come so far in reality.What is the meaning of it all? Why put the whole circus together due to one mental patient? Why feed on his delusions, if the goal is to make him accept his past? Why is he more interesting than all the other patients? Why don't they just talk to him and give him medicine that prevents him to invent an alternative reality? Yes it is 1954 and yes the time they knew not what we know today and yes they would probably give him a lobotomy as it is indicated they will at the end of the movie. But still.There is so much that does not make sense in the movie and when it itself is so cliché-filled, I really can not take it seriously.",1,124,262,12 March 2010
Captain America: The First Avenger," Ridiculous boring propaganda crap
","I don't know what I hate more about this two-hour snooze-fest: the Uncle Sam wants you posters, the obvious propaganda advertisements for the US army, the Captain America suit and shield, the future technology of even today, existing 70 years ago during world war 2 or the musical part when they invent Captain America and make him perform on theater stages and sing.I also hate how much this movie is in love with itself, how seriously it takes itself and how propaganda/patriotic it is: the name of the hero in itself: 'Captain America' makes me wanna throw up.Out of all the Marvel movies this one is the worst because of the propaganda and the awful musical score.It has a lot more action than the equally awful X Men First Class and Thor but it is still way too long.Avengers is definitely gonna be he worst of the movies, putting all of those ridiculous Marvel heroes together in one movie.Only nerds can like these crappy movies.",1,17,38,29 January 2012
The Color of Money," Most boring movie I've ever seen.
",I can't believe this snooze-fest is actually made by Martin Scorsese of all people.It's about people playing pool for money in bars and in actual official tournaments as if it was baseball.You think it sounds boring? Watching paint dry would be more exciting.Nothing happens for an hour and a half. All the characters are unlikeable and the performances are awful and the actors seemed as bored as the audience. The only thing about the movie that was enjoyable was Tom Cruises ridiculous hair and his even worse clothes.I don't care if Paul Newman was one of those great actors from the good old days. And I don't care if Scorse made Cape Fear (his masterpiece) 5 years later. Both Newman and Scorsese suck with this movie.And to make it worse I hate Mary Elizxabeth Mastrantonio. The woman with the most ridiculous last name whose career ended sometime after The Abyss.Avoid this stinker. Especially if you like Tom Cruise.,1,6,18,2 August 2015
Armageddon," Heroic sentimental crap at its worst
","I hate this movie!! I usually love Michael Bays's movies, except from this and the even worse: Pearl Harbor.I don't know what I hate more. That the Americans once again save the world and no other country in the world can do it, the fact that several major cities around the world is destroyed and milions are killed but in the US, only a small part of N.Y. is destroyed, because the Americans are the only real humans, to hell with the rest of us, the president giving speeches while we watch children playing, the roughnecks/ astronauts walking in slow-motion towards the camera, the scene where the roughnecks sing, the love scenes between Affleck and Tyler, Affleck, Tyler being reduced to a sobbing pathetic woman waiting for daddy and her boyfriend to come home, Bruce Wiilis crying, the American flag, the complete unrealism of the plot, the fact that Afflecks character is a complete moron and Bruce fires him but still wants him on the team that's suppose to save the world?? You name moronic storyline and its on the screen. And lets not forget the awful musical score that made me wanna puke all the time.I would like to see a spoof, where the oh so heroic, oh so perfect Americans tries to save the world but fails miserably and has to watch England or Norway save the world instead.In real life all the US ever does is going into war with the middle east and treat all Europeans with no exceptions as potential terrorists at the customs at US airports. Something they have done ever since 9/11. And their current leader is the dumbest president ever, in the entire history of presidents all over the world.So I guess you Americans need to believe you are heroes through movies, because in real life that is the last thing you are.",1,5,9,17 August 2008
"I, Robot"," Good story, lousy cgi
","This movie has a good story, but it relies way too much on badly made cgi. The robots look fake, Will Smiths car looks fake, the surroundings look fake and its hard to focus on anything else, when there are cgi in almost every shot of the film.I know the movie was made back in 2004 and it was probably state of the art back then, but I've seen 20 year old movies with more convincing effects. With modern LCD TV sets and HDMI and Bluray, you can no longer get away with bad cgi. This movie look like a really well made computer game. But it doesn't look the least bit real. And when every action scene in the movie is entirely cgi, it ruins it for me. Personally I prefere real action with stunt men and real props and cars. But if they have to make it entirely cgi, it has to look real.Had the movie been made today in 2008 it would have looked real and I would have been able to focus more on the story.",4,4,6,13 April 2008
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," An insult to the original movie and book
","Bad acting, zero character development, no atmosphere. It doesn't take it's time to tell the story and everything is rushed through. Rooney Mara is completely unbelievable as Lisbeth Salander. And Daniel Craig has nothing to work with as Mikael Blomquist. Americans should stop being lazy and bother to read subtitles so awful remakes like this can be avoided in the future.I have nothing more to say but IMDb demand 10 lines.CrapCrapCrap Movies like this should make a 0 star rating possible.",1,20,35,11 August 2012
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Everything Bond should be.
","Daniel Craig has taken the fun out of Bond. Gone is Pierce Brosnan, the humor, the babes, the exotic locations, the villains trying to destroy or take over the whole planet. Even the action sucks.Enter the M.I. franchise, in particular the 5th movie and you have the perfect spy movie with lots of thrilling breath-taking real action scenes with real stunts done on location, real practical effects, babes, exotic locations, humor, energy, great characters, great stories and an energy and a fun thrill ride you won't find in the crappy awful Bond and Bourne franchises. Or in the even worse over bloated CGI and oh so serious and oh so boring superhero movies.The reason: Tom Cruise: this guy loves acting, he loves movies and he loves making movies. The M.I. franchise is his baby and he cares what the audience wants. He still has the energy like when he was 25. And that shines through in his performance and it makes the other actors give themselves as much to the movie as he does.That is particularly obvious with the hot new Swedish actress in Hollywood: Rebecca Ferguson. Not only does she have a great body as well as being beautiful, but she can also kick ass and do her own stunts as good as Tom Cruise.I hope her character Ilsa Faust will be a new addition to Ethan Hunts team in future M.I. movies.Daniel Craig, could learn something here. All he can do is bitch and moan about being Bond and he delivers the worst Bond ever. Thanks for nothing you ugly blond brite with pointy ears and a face like a 70 year old. If you're fed up with superheroes and horrible PG13-remakes of R-rated classics and you miss those days, when they made old school action movies, that didn't have to be depressing and/or realistic, but just fun, this movie and this franchise is for you.",10,3,5,7 May 2016
Ocean's Eleven," Crap!!
","One of those movies that you either walk out on or fall asleep while watching it.This is a movie about 3 casinoes being robbed in Las Vegas. For the entire movie, they talk about the robberies. They talk some more and more and more and more talk. They all wear expensive suits and sunglasses. Julia Roberts character is an annoying bitch in this film. The fact that I cant stand her, makes it even harder to watch any move that has her in it.When the boring characters are done talking about the robberies, the movie is over. We never get to see the robberies. Tell me Mr Soderbergh, why do you make a movie about casino robberies without ever showing the robberies? Was it a budget problem or did you just like cheating your audience of even one actionscene in what is probably the most boring film ever made!!!And on top of that you've made a sequel which I've heard is even more boring, if that is possible. And now you're making a third movie. Why do you make these crap-movies instead of making good movies like you used to??",Null,0,1,22 August 2006
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Snooze Protocol
","Why people loove this pile of garbage so much is beyond me. It tells a lot about the fact that the audience that likes this don't have a clue about judging bad movies from good movies.Mission Impossible 1 was bad but still 100 times better than this one.MI:2 was bad but still 100 times better than this one.MI:3 was a master piece.And because the third movie was so excellent, Ghost Protocol seems even more like ameteur hour.The movie is very very long and has almost no action. And the few actionscenes that there are, are badly made. Shot in a weird way with no continuity and members of Hunts team asking moronic questionsd instead of killing the badguys. The only scene that worked was of course the one where Hunt hangs outside the tallest buliding in the world. That having been said, I've seen Olsen Banden (danish comedies about a trio of robbers from the 1970'ies) that had more action that Snooze Protocol.FAIL!! The attempt at being funny, also fails. And so does the annoying stuff about malfunctioning gear and the fact that this group of morons could'nt work together if their very lifes depended on it. And their lifes does depend on them working together, because the villain wants to start world war 3. But the lousy director Brad Bird, can't make it the least bit exciting. Instead he tries to make every scene funny.FAIL AGAIN!! The villain is badly played by Swedish actor Michael Nyquist. He does'nt appear dangerous at all and he looks like he is about to fall asleep in the very short time he is actually in the movie.FAIL AGAIN!!I also hate Agent Brandt, who could have been a rouge agent but instead have this stupid secret that he thinks he killed Hunts wife, from the third movie, which he did'nt and Hunt appaerently knows this through the entire film, which leaves the hole mysterious stuff about Brandt as a giant plot hole.FAIL AGAIN!! When the hell are Hollywood ever gonna stop using directors to direct action movies, who does'nt have a clue how to make action movies?? In Brad Birds case it's his first time ever, directing actors. And he can't even get that right.FAIL! FAIL! FAIL! FAIL!",1,3,8,24 May 2012
Drive," Pretentious crap
","Drive truly sucks @ss. It's made by an awful movie director who suffers from dyslexia, from my country Denmark, who has an ego the zise of Lars Von Trier but not even a quarter his talent.Drive is a weird crappy movie.It has nice cinematography and atmosphere in the cool opening but completely lets down after wards for the rest of the movie.The first part of the movie is really boring. Ryan Gosling's acting is wooden and he is mumbling his very few lines so it's hard to understand what he is saying and care about him. His so called love interest is played by Carey Muligan. An actress who is about as sexy as a doormat and really annoys me. And there is no chemistry what so ever between her and Gosling. And that makes it hard to believe why his character will kill to protect her and her kid and die for them id necessary.Then Muligans husband gets out of prison and instead of getting jealous because Gosling has been getting close to his wife and son and wondering if Gosling has been banging his wife, he immediately likes him and they become friends. Yeah right!! Where the hell is the realism here?? The last part of the movie is almost non-stop sick sadistic violence. Goslings character turns into a regular Schwarzenegger, killing every bad guy, except the ones that, kill each other, before he can get to them.Refn (the director) is mostly known for a crappy trilogy called Pusher and some even worse American movies.Why this movie is so well liked amongst critics is beyond me. But maybe it's the sloow pace of the movie and the helicopter shots of L.A. and maybe they think thats art but it's not.Similar cinematography can be seen in Collateral, where it looks better and Collateral is a far better movie than this turds of a movie.",1,7,17,6 December 2011
Insidious," Truly scary!!
","One of the scariest horror-films I have seen in a long time. A mix of Orphan, Dead Silence and The Haunting In Connecticut. Only even more scary.The movie takes it time, before the scares start. But once they do, be prepared to sleep with the lights on.The only daemon that wasn't scary was the one that looked like Darth Maul. But the rest of them was plenty scary. Do not watch Insidous alone. Watch it with friends and during the day, not at night-time.Excellent horror, the way all horror movies should be.",10,0,0,23 March 2012
Ex Machina," Artmovie disguised as sci-fi
","This movie is more an art movie than it is sci-fi.Had it been sci-fi/horror as the trailer indicates, it might have been interesting. But it's mostly boring. Al though it kept me curious enough to watch it until the end, it never really delivered.There are several plot holes in the movie. The main one is Nathan, the founder of the fictional Microsoft like company 'Bluebook'.Why would a man as rich as he is, isolate himself completely from the rest of the world, just to work on his robots, when he is clearly lonely? Why is he not living in a big city and partying and getting laid with women that wanna marry him, because of his wealth? Why would Caleb agree to meet him and spend a week at his research facility, no questions asked? Why is there no service on Calebs smart-phone? A man like Nathan would wanna be online 24/7 as he is as he chose Caleb, who did not win any lottery at the Bluebook company.Why would Nathan not have build his robots, so he could shut them down without having to go any wear near them, in case they get out of control? Why would Nathan have build robots that can trigger power failure when they recharge their batteries without Nathan knowing about this? Why would Caleb stay in a facility with no windows alone with another man that he doesn't even know? How can Caleb fall in love with a robot in less than a week? Even if she is based on his pornography profile? (what the hell is that? I googled it and there is no such thing) As attractive and intelligent as the robot Ava, appears, she is still just a machine. And that a man as intelligent as Caleb, can be manipulated by a robot is ridiculous.And in my opinion Nathan is not evil. He might be torturing his robots that are all female and have sex with them and eventually shut them down. But they're not living creatures. They're machines that he created. And he has the right to do whatever he wants to with his own creations.Then there is Ava's body with and without skin on it. Without skin, she has a big butt and big breasts. But as soon as she has put skin on her body both her butt and breasts has been reduced in size. This is of course due to Alicia Wikanders sad petite body. But why make the body without skin so attractive, when the body with skin is so sad?? They should have cast a more attractive actress with a curvy body, like Scarlett Johansson. That would have made sense.And as far as Ava's, face and scull goes, it's not even an original design. In the original 1987 Robocop movie, Robocops face and scull, look almost exactly the same as Ava's.READ NO FURTHER IF YOU PLAN TO SEE THE MOVIE!! As far as the ending goes, it didn't make much sense. Ava and another robot kills Nathan and Ava escapes, leaving Caleb locked inside the facility. Nathan wouldn't have made his robots so intelligent that they could manipulate humans or be strong enough to kill humans or control the power. The helicopter pilot that flew Nathan to the facility would have questioned Ava showing up at the end of the week instead of Caleb. He would have called Nathan to verify whatever lie Ava told him to get on the helicopter.I could go on and on with the major plot holes of this movie.I can only say, if you expect a sci-fi horror movie, you will get neither. The only interesting part of the movie is the special effects that are impressive, but not stunning once you know how they did it.With a bigger budget and a different ending, this could have been a much better movie.",2,15,31,27 March 2016
Evil Dead," Don't believe the hype
","*SPOILER AHEAD* This is a bad movie. I don't mind the gore, al though it's not as gross as in the preview, but the story is predictable and boring. As a horror-movie this does'nt work either. It takes it self too seriously. The whole concept is so ridiculous that it needs to make fun of it self to work. The original Evil Dead from 1981 was straight up horror though, unlike the two sequels which were horror-comedies. But the original unlike this remake was much better done. Al though it had a much smaller budget and the effects were not half as good as in this one (they were down right cheesy) it actually managed to be scary. Mostly because of the amazing camera work and because the evil dead was a force living in the woods instead of just ghosts.But let's go over the things that made this movie suck. It has no Ash aka Bruce Campbell. He made the old movies work, because of his acting and his looks. None of the characters here are remotely interesting, mostly because they're really stupid. For instance why stay in a cabin where the basement is filled with dead rotten cats hanging from the ceiling? Why open a book that is wrapped in plastic with barbed wire around it? Why starting to translate a book with clear warnings on the first pages to leave the book alone? Why decide to stay at the creepy cabin after one of the characters have been first badly injured in the woods then gotten third degree burns on her face? Why not swim across a flooded road when it's obvious that staying will be much worse than trying to escape? All the actors are doing a good job but none of them are the obvious lead that the audience can root for. Every time I thought I figured out who would survive I was wrong and it was really annoying.Watch the original and avoid this one.",8,5,9,22 August 2013
Paranormal Activity," Zero activity
","Probably the most boring movie I've ever seen. I've been more scared listening to static.For the first 30 minutes nothing happens. Then the demon starts harassing the young couple. But the only harassing part is the boyfriend. His girlfriend is obviously terrified and instead of supporting her and protecting her, he keeps filming her constantly and he refuses to stop when she asks him to. The guy is an a**hole. I was not scared at any point, just wanted to beat the hell out of the boyfriend for being such a d*ck towards his girlfriend. At one point he is actually jealous, because the demon likes the girlfriend and not him. How retarded is this guy? Then there are all the dumb dumb flaws. The couple calls a demonologist (a con-artist) before anything has happened at all. The audience should be as scared as the couple but we're not. And because of that we could not care less.They film a lot during the day and then it looks like a reality show. If they wanted it to be scary they should only have filmed at night and the couple should have acted like rational normal people living in a haunted house.When something finally starts to happen, it's a door closing all by it self. So lame!! And speaking of the door. The demon always enter the bedroom through the door. Why don't the couple just close the door at night?? It would at least make them feel safe. And if they're really so scared how come they can sleep like babies every night? Except when, they're awaken by noises and the girlfriend acts possessed.Why don't they leave the house a lot earlier? Why don't they ask friends to sleep over and keep the lights on at night? When the boyfriend finally stops being a selfish pr*ck and finally decides, it's time to leave, he instead, burns a wooden cross in the fireplace and they stay in the house after all. I could go an and on about the countless plot holes in this moronic movie.At the end the boyfriend dies so it ends happily. All though the lame cgi should have been avoided.The only thing that kept me and my body awake through this snooze-fest was that the girlfriend was pretty and hot with big boops.Why it is considered one of the scariest movies ever made is completely beyond me.",1,2,4,30 October 2010
A Clockwork Orange," Disturbing yet pointless movie
","This movie sucks!! From the clothes, to the retarded mix of English and Russian to the theatrical way the violent scenes are shot. The theatrical shooting of the violence, makes it impossible to take it seriously. I've seen more graphic violence in modern TV-series than in this over-rated crap.Malcolm McDowell has always been repulsive in every movie he has ever appeared in, which made him good for the part of the psychopath Alex I guess. The only part where he was more repulsive was as Caligula in the movie Caligula.The movie has a lot of offensive sexual symbolism and the awful soundtrack and the annoying classic music is probably symbolistic as well. But I really don't give a damn, what it's suppose to mean. It's just stupid, disturbing and pointless.A Clokwork Orange is as dumb as it title and it's one of those movies that you leaves you un-easy after watching it, even though there is no point with this movie what so ever.If you feel like you HAVE to watch this movie because it's considered a classic, don't put yourself through the torture. It's classic BS and it should be avoided completely.",1,16,38,25 May 2011
Total Recall," Sharon Stone is smoking hot, but that's it!!
","I used to like this movie. but now that I've seen it again on a Full HD-TV, I can see how bad it really is.The set-pieces are so lame. The cities on Mars look like something from a low-budget TV-show. The mountains and the sky are clearly paintings. The puppets replacing Arnold and other actors are badly made. Kuato, the alien-baby stuck on a guys chest is the worst made puppet in the film. Chucky was more convincing in Child's Play two years prior to this movie.The air bursting through the windows where people live at the end look really bad. All in all the special effects are awful, even for a movie at that time. Aliens from 1986 have more convincing special effects and still looks good today, 24 years later. Besides from one scene shot outside, the entire movie is shot on various sound stages. And it makes the movie look extremely low-budget although I'm sure it was very expensive at the time.The bad-guys are too much cliché. Ronny Cox was so much better in Robocop.Michael Ironside is also wasted here. He was much better in Starship Troopers.Even the fun grotescue violence, that is Verhoevens trademark and the sometimes funny scenes can't save this crap.The way too obvious product placement made me sick. In two or three scenes, it becomes very clear what paid for this entire movie and Arnie's presumably very large paycheck.The only good thing about a movie that looks like a low-budget sci-fi today, is Sharon Stone. She was incredibly sexy and every time she appeared in a scene, me and my buddy started paying attention to the movie again, at least while she was on the screen. Why Arnies character, Quaid, would prefer Rachel Ticotin over Sharon Stone is a bigger and much more interesting mystery than whether or not the whole thing is a dream in Quaids head.And the plot does'nt make sense. Others have commented on the many plot-holes, so I won't be getting into that.I give it 2 stars because of Sharon Stone. The rest of the movie sucks.",2,6,19,4 July 2010
Eyes Wide Shut," The ending ruins the whole film
","Ive just watch Eyes Wide Shut. I had no great expectations, because I expected the movie to be boring. So I was pleasantly surprised by how good it appeared to be. The party with the people wearing masks and banging in every room was really creepy and scary. But no questions was ever really answered. It seemed quite clear to me that Cruises friend lied to him about what happened to Nick, the pianist and Cruise just accepted the answer. And how did Cruises mask end up in his bed next to his wife??I cant accept that there wasnt anything more going on. That the whole party was staged. And why wasnt Cruise furious with his wife when she admitted wanting to sleep with another man? Why didnt he get back at her by sleeping with other women? This movie could have been so much more but instead it was just everyday life with a few strange things going on. And the ending was ridicoulus. It ruined the whole film. Al of a sudden it was just over and I felt like Ive been cheated. I hope Kubrick is turning in his grave over how bad his last film was. Movies like The Shining and Full Metal Jacket was great but this is a big mess with alot of unanswered questions.",Null,1,2,2 May 2002
The Da Vinci Code," Boring book, boring movie
","The Da Vinci Crap is one of the worst books ever written and Dan Brown is a lousy writer. Besides from creating a conspiracy theory that is so far fetched that its laughable, the actual story itself, is so simple it could have been written by a 12 year old kid. The characters are vaguely described and boring and I for one don't care what happens to them.As for the movie, they have done everything wrong.First of all Tom Hanks, my god, the man couldn't be a worse Robert Langdon even if he tried. In the book he is described as a tall, handsome, middle aged goodlooking man. Tom Hanks is too old, he looks like a dork and he is ugly. David Duchovny from The X-files would have been perfect as Langdon. He is goodlooking, a better actor and not a pain in the ass like Hanks. But he is not a star like Hanks and I bet Howard never even considered anyone else besides his old friend Hanks for that part. Then they cast Audrey Tautou as Sophie. Sure she is pretty but probably the worst acting I have ever seen. And there is no chemistry between her and Hanks what so ever. Paul Bettany is excellent however as Silas, the only interesting character in the book/movie and Ian McKellen and Jean Reno are also good.Then, Ron Howard, for reasons unknown decided to change things from the book and add new scenes. Like the scene on the plane where Sophie confronts Silas. what is the point of that scene?? And the way Silas dies, probably Howard thought it should be more dramatized. And then there is the ending which sucks!!! The real ending at least worked in the book. But I guess Howasrd must have thought to himself: I've already cast the wrong actor for the lead, so Im gonna ruin the ending as well.They should have made a movie out of Angels and Demons instead. It has a better story, more action and more interesting characters. Still bad because Dan Brown is the author, but much better than The Da vinci Crap.",1,0,3,27 October 2006
Thor," Has NOTHING to do with the Nordic mythology!!
","The movie is probably true to the Marvel comics, although I've never read the ones about Thor. I do know, however, that it is not true at all to the Nordic mythology about the gods in Valhalla.First of all that futuristic look of a golden city in the skies could not be further from what Valhalla looks like. Valhalla was a wooden fortress as they looked during the covered wagon times.The gods were dressed in capes and not gold and metal.Odin had two talking ravens called Hugin and Munin that were messengers from Asgårdand Udgård, telling Odin everything that went on outside Valhalla.Thor himself had a wagon with two flying goats suspended to it. Thor never rode a horse like he does in this movie.And then there was Heimdal, played by a black guy. What the hell?? The Nordic gods had Scandinavian looks, which means they were white with blond hair and blue eyes. And in the movie there is also an Asian guy. There were no black or Asian guys in Valhalla!! And I don't normally have a problem with black and Asian people in movies but this alone is such an insult to the mythology.As I am from Denmark and I love the Nordic mythology because of the exciting funny stories, I hated this movie from the very beginning. And so did my buddy. We fast-forwarded to action sequences and scenes with Natalie Portman, because she is so hot. I don't even remember the ending of this crap. Except something about a giant Robot that shot fire from it's face. I know, right? I only hope that someday, somebody will get a green light, to make a movie that is true to the mythology and not a based on any comic book.If Stan Winston invented this version of Thor and Valhalla he should be ashamed of himself and forced to apologize for not making it true to the mythology.The mythology was a religion for vikings and peasants in Iceland, Norway and Denmark. People really believed in these gods and Thor is a complete mockery of that religion.Some people will probably tell me to lighten up and say it's just a movie.But all insults afar it's not even a good movie. It's way too long and boring and it takes itself way too seriously. The serious part is probably the movies biggest flaw, given the laughable premise. The action sequences are too far apart and they are done in a boring way. Kennethy Brannagh clearly has no clue how to make action sequences.And Valhalla is some of the worst cgi I've seen in a long long time.Don't watch this crap. The only Marvel adaption worse than this was the awful awful Jonah Hex",Null,1,4,7 September 2011
Mystic River," I didn't like the ending *spoilers*
","SPOILERS It was a good crimestory. But i don't like sean penn. Especially not in this film. He goes from grieving father to icecold killer. Acting like a gangster with the Savage brothers helping him out. Its not believable even though he has killed before. I feel so bad for Tim Robbins character. The guy is a wreck after what happened to him in his childhood. He gets worse and worse during the film only to end up being killed in cold blood buy sean penn who forces a confession out of the poor guy. And then penns insane wife completely accepts what he has done and gives him compliments and says he is a great father. and he ends up standing at a townparade with his wife smiling, not giving a damn about killing an innocent man. I wanted Penns character to die or at least go to jail at the end of the film. but he gets away with it. And he turns Robbins wife into a widow. But thats not shown in the film. Penn was the badguy in the film. Not the boys and not Robbins. but Penn.",Null,0,0,23 December 2003
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Bay's worst movie since Armageddon
","I'm normally a fan of Bay's movies, except from Armageddon which I really, really hate.The list of reasons why this movie suck is endless. Two and a half hours is a long time, if you don't have the story to back it up. None of the humor that worked in the first Transformers, which I love, works here. Sam's mom is incredibly annoying and Megan Fox couldn't act if her life depended on it.There is no plot in this movie and yet endless plot-holes. They've already been mentioned by others, but I will mention one: Bumblebee is completely unaware that Sam has a Decepticon in human disguise in his car/Bumblebee. That particular Decepticon is a complete and way too obvious rip-off of The Terminatrix in Terminator 3. But the scene where it tries to seduce Sam is the only scene in the entire movie that is just a little creepy and actually works. The movie is in general way too childish and tries way too hard to be funny. The robots have more screen time than the actors and cgi-characters cannot replace real actors. The scene where Optimus was talking to a politician was so horrible and annoying. Speaking of that, why the hell was Obama mentioned by name?? Usually the president is fictitious, so why mention the real president? I don't think Obama is too happy to be associated with this pile of monkey-crap anyway.The scene on Cybertron was annoying and childish. And all the scenes with Agent Simmons and Leo (who looks almost exactly like Shia, why is that Bay??) should have been cut out of the movie. None of the romantic scenes work and should have been cut out as well. And Bay should be ashamed of advertising for his own previous movies in both the first Transformers and in this one.Bay are of course already planning a third movie. And just like the Pirates sequels and the Matrix sequels, the third one will suck too. I hate sequels clearly made only for the money with no story, no hart, no nothing, except huge action-sequences and annoying attempts of humor that falls flat on its ass.I hope Bay will some day come to his senses and make a movie again like The Rock. Still his best movie ever, with the best acting, best score and best everything.Bay has proved that he is only making movies for the money. Not because he likes to tell stories or enjoys directing, which he is not very good at by the way. Bay was so busy trashing the robots in Terminator Salvation, but even though Salvation still sucks it's a far better movie that this one. Witch just proves that without a descent script, you got nothing. Not the biggest explosion ever with actors on set can make up for a script, written while Bay was sitting on the can.Avoid this movie at all cost!!",1,13,29,30 June 2009
American Gangster," Boring and way too long
","Yeah, yeah I know its Ridley Scott and it will probably win a few academy awards and he made Alien and Gladiator and bla bla bla but when I watched this with a friend, we almost fell asleep from boredom. It's suppose to be a gangstermovie but all they do is talk, talk, talk. Almost no action at all. Russel Crowe displays wooden acting which he has done in all his movies except from 'Proof of life' and 'LA Confidential'. Denzel Washington doesn't look anything like the real Frank Lucas. He is way too handsome. And he plays the character too much like a nice guy and here is why that is a problem.I read an interview with the real Richie Roberts, who caught Frank Lucas, who don't understand why is Lucas represented as a good man in this film. According to Roberts, he killed more black people than the KKK, ruined several black families and he was a drug-lord. He was a murderer and a criminal, nothing more. And Ridley Scott makes him seem like a businessman who just happens to be moving cocaine and heroine.And the real tragedy of it all, was that Frank Lucas only got 7 years in prison, instead of the 70 years, he was sentenced to serve. Because he testified against cops that took bribes from him. And now, because of the movie he sees himself as a hero and a star. And that's how the audience will sea him as well. Nice going Ridley: you made a very, very, very long and really, really, really boring movie, making a murderer and a drug-lord seem like Martin Luther King.I know nobody will agree with me, but even the greatest moviedirectors in the world, makes bad movies from time to time and this is one of them.",1,71,119,4 January 2008
The Reader," Depressing and boring
","I gladly admit I only saw most of this movie, because Kate Winslet is naked and it has sex in it. And I don't mind serious dramas, but this is just pretentious and dull.Kate Winslet whose acting sucks in this movie, is made completely unattractive, wearing no makeup and she has saggy breasts with stretch-marks on them.And I hate her phony accent. If shes suppose to be German, the accent is all wrong. The accent doesn't sound like any real accent.The movie has zero chemistry between Winslet and the boy (who does a descent job) she seduces and takes as her lover.I fast forwarded to all the nude-scenes because I couldn't stand Winslets bad acting and the overall depressing mood in the film. By the time it got to Winslets trial, because she was apparently a guard in a nazi-camp during WW2 I gave up on this pretentious boring piece of crap of a movie.Don't watch this movie. Unless you wanna get depressed. The nudity isn't even worth your time.",1,5,15,12 August 2015
X-Men: First Class," How it all began zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
","Very very very long and very very very boring prequel to the previous X-men film.And what's with the title: First Class?? Is that because the people behind this crap think this movie is better than the first three abominations of X-men movies? The only good things in this movie are Michael Fassbender and all of the gorgeous voluptuous female mutants.The best scene is the one minute scene where Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) tells Xavier and Magneto to go f*ck themselves before they get a chance to even tell him who they are.And that scene just made me miss the Wolverine movie that has five things this movie completely lacks: a good story, lots of action, it was funny, had interesting characters and good acting.I imagine Hugh refused to be a part of this garbage since he is making his own movies now only about Wolverine. I only hope that a sequel to Wolverine will come soon so I can forget this load of bull-crap.",Null,3,6,2 September 2011
Beowulf," Good fun
","I saw a bad copy of this film, so the animation looked like a computergame. I will definitely rent this when it comes out on DVD.The story is simple but a good adventure. But being danish, I've never heard of Beowulf. But as I understand the myth is much more famous in England than here.But still, there are things that I wonder why they can't get right, whenever they portray Denmark in foreign movies. First of all, we have no mountains here. This is a completely flat country with only big hills. But they don't come even close to real mountains. Secondly, we speak danish in Denmark, not English. I know this movie is made in the US, but they could at least speak with danish accents. It was the same problem with 'The Prince and me'. Appaerently the royal family in Denmark speaks English with a British accent and not danish. It just shows how little the Americans actually know of Denmark. The ones that have heard of our country, thinks it's the capital of Sweden.But enough of that. Like I said I liked this movie, but I think it would have been much more entertaining and definitely much more impressive, if they had made this as a real movie. But I guess it would have been way to expensive to make. Or maybe it was because Ray Winstone who is old and overweight, could'nt have played the part as a young Beowulf.Even though I saw a bad copy, I could still tell that animated actors still look fake. The technology hasn't improved since Final Fantasy.Angelina Jolie was hot as Grendels mother. And she had a much nicer and curvier body than in real life. Impressive that they could take this bony actress and make her so sexy in an animated version.But I have to wonder why they made this animated movie, when two real movies already has been made. The last one in 2005, from Iceland. And another one with Christopher Lambert from 1999.I give this movie 5 out of 10. Maaybe I will rank it higher, when I see a good copy on DVD.",5,1,2,9 January 2008
Live Free or Die Hard," Watch the unrated version instead...
","All though I liked it as an action movie, it didn't feel like Die Hard because of the PG 13 rating.In the unrated version Mcclane is allowed to say the f-word and gunshot wounds and blood is allowed as well. It makes a big difference, because profanity and violence is as much a part of the Die Hard movies as singing is a part of musicals. Die Hard are not action movies for kids and it was ridiculous and an insult to the fans, to try to get a wider audience by making a TV-version of Die Hard.Timothy Olyphant is still a lame, not scary villain and had Thomas Gabriel met Hans Gruber, he would have messed up his pants. He can't measure up to Bruce Willis.But Bruce Willis himself is still the coolest action hero around!! But some of the bad guys, working for Thomas Gabriel, what language are they speaking and why can't they be Americans like their leader? Is it Len Wiseman's preference for European characters like in his Underworld movies?But the unrated version is almost as good a Die Hard movie as the previous ones. Let's just hope they can find a scarier villain for the 5th movie and get a pg 18-rating instead.If you don't live in the US, you have to order the movie online. In Denmark, we got the kiddie-version of Die Hard in the theaters as well as on DVD.If you have not seen Die Hard 4 yet and you love the old movies, steer clear of the pg 13 version as it is not Die Hard.I give it 8 out of 10.",8,0,1,30 December 2007

He should retire in real life as his character has in the movie.There is zero chemistry between Bruce and his so called love interest: Parker. Parker is annoying as hell. As well as Mirren. Freeman and Malkovich. The only one giving a good performance in this awkward unfunny action comedy is Karl Urban. I root for him. Not the old Bruce (Douchebag) Willis and his really old friends.Avoid this, unless you're a Mirren or Malkovich fan. Evereyone else should stay clear of this crap and watch or re-watch The Last Boyscout.

The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Is Lady Gaga the costumedesigner on this crap?
","I really really hate these movies. Sure this is a little better than the original. But still way too long. Nothing happens at all until 90 minutes into the movie. Why can't they ever make these movies shorter? Like an hour 45 minutes at the most.I don't know what I hate more the ridiculous customes and makeup on all the rich a-holes in the capitol or the watered down violece to make it PG13. I've heard that the books are pretty violent.Or how it's possible for the rich b*st*rds to keep everyone poor and under control?? And why is America divided into districts?? This is in some post apocalyptic future that looks like Russia 30 years ago. Where it's always winter, except in the capitol. These things are never explained in the movies. Possibly in the books that I will never read anyway. So I don't know if there was a nuclear war. And I don't really care.What I do know is that these movies would have been much more interesting if they had been R rated.If they had spend less money on crappy CGI and gay looking Lady Gaga customes and makeup and more money on action and real violence. And if they had made them 30-45 minutes shorter. Then these movies might have been interesting.Jennifer Lawrence is not even that hot. Nice body but ugly face and the general acting except from Woody Harrelson is a joke.Avoid these sh*tt* movies.",1,2,6,15 November 2015
Deadpool," Finally an R-rated comicbook movie and they make it this lame
","I was really looking forward to Deadpool as I'm a Ryan Reynolds fan and it's rated R.However the humor is toilet humor. It's about farts, jerking off and comments about actors, including Reynolds himself and other movies.The plot is that Wade Wilson gets terminal cancer and in order to save his life he agrees to undergo an experiment that will give him the power to heal. However Ajax, the man that turn people into mutants and sometimes just kill them, can't be trusted. And Ajax, who is the villain is played by the awful Ed Skrein from the awful reboot of Transporter. Ajax tortures Wade and the lab explodes (I can't remember why) and Wade has become scarred and takes the new identity as Deadpool. He starts to kill a lot of people looking for Ajax. But even though the movie is rated R, some scenes where he tortures badguys are actually not shown. Ajax in a desperate attempt to stop Wade kidnaps Wades boney girlfriend and Wade has to get help from the two most annoying X-men characters I have ever seen. Some lesbian looking teenage girl with a shaved head and a cgi-Russian guy made out of metal.The violence is awesome and a welcome change from the bloodless Marvel violence. However all the violence can be seen in the red band trailer and the rest is crap. So if you've seen the trailer, I recommend not watching the movie as you will be really disappointed.Bringing X-men into the movie is annoying as hell as I've always hated the X-men. And Wade talking to the camera gets really annoying after a while.On top of that the action itself is disappointing as this is clearly a low budget movie.Avoid this and watch the first Kickass movie (not the second one!!!) if you like violent superhero movies.",1,98,210,22 May 2016
The Island," Product Placement inc.
","This should have been the title of this movie, as I have never seen so many brands shamelessly showed in almost every scene of the movie. I get that product placements helps finance movies but this is disgusting. I think there must be around 15 different brands through out the movie. And if they don't shove the brands in the audiences faces they talk about them.The funny thing is I've seen this movie many times before but it's the first time I've actually noticed it.I almost prefer it when Bay advertise for his older movies by placing movie posters of them in his newer movies. At least it's only for a few seconds and then it's over.I must admit I still enjoyed watching The Island in spite of the shameless advertising.Mostly because the future looks so good and because of Scarlett Johansson and enjoyable action-sequences.And the whole idea of the underground bunker where they make clones is done very nicely and convincingly.But not among Bays best movies.",7,1,2,1 January 2013
