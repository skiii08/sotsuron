10 Cloverfield Lane," Great movie, all the way until the ridiculous ending
","Unfortunately I have to agree with many of the reviewers here: the movie is great and builds up great tension, all the way up until the ridiculous last 10-15 minutes, where the protagonist defeats a bunch of aliens all by herself that probably just destroyed most of humanity. John Goodman does, like always, an amazing job.",7,1,2,22 November 2019
The Equalizer," Never believable, never boring
","This film has all the ingredients of the classic American action movie: the good versus the bad, America versus Russia, the happy end.I must say that even though the film misses any sort of true storyline or plot, and never fails to amaze in its total implausibility, never at any point did I get bored or want to turn off the movie. I guess that it is only the quality of the performance by Denzel Washington that makes you forget about the lack of storyline and the unrealistic super-hero capabilities of his character, which is a complement for him but not so much for the script itself.A decent watch for a lazy, rainy Sunday afternoon.",7,3,4,25 January 2015
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Definitely not one of Tarantino's best
","Slow movie, with especially very slow middle part that was not very engaging. As a non-American viewer under the age of 40, I bet I missed many hints at historical facts and characters. Without DiCaprio and Pitt, this movie would have rated much lower than it does now. The final scene is maybe the only really good one in the movie.",7,1,3,22 November 2019
Call Me by Your Name," Horrible acting, dreadful, long and insanely weird dialogues
","This movie really disappointed. Both protagonists are either bad actors or totally uncomfortable in their roles. They both come across as creepy and crazy. Most of the dialogues in the movie don't make any sense. Especially throughout the first 75% of the movie, there is just one weird unintelligible dialogue after another. Nothing hits the spot. I bet many people appreciate this movie for the fine Italian scenery, but that it really the only good thing about this movie, and I can go to Italy for that.The storyline itself also doesn't make any sense. The movie seems a loose collection of scenes, and perhaps if you've read the book it all makes more sense, but without reading the book, it's quite hard to understand what the hell kind of random thing is going on now.The worst thing is the end where the father appears to say that he is also a closeted gay guy. I mean... he's having a conversation with his gay son about his first love, and there he goes and he reveals he's been gay all along as well? His son is crying and he just goes and says like 'I know what you're going through, I'm married to your mother and all, but I'm also gay! Surprise!' Well hello. Just absolutely ridiculous this movie. I appreciated it more for its ridiculousness than for anything els.",2,4,20,16 August 2018
Midsommar," Very bad - but still kind of fun to watch
","With 2,5 hours the movie is undoubtedly too long, especially since it is lacking any real plot or conclusion. During the film I was constantly curious what was going to happen next, and when it would start to become clear what this was all about. At the end I realized that it would not become clear: all that I had seen turned out to be just a series of bizarre rituals, without any real conclusion to finish. Don't expect too much when watching this movie, and you might enjoy it for its bizarreness.",7,2,10,12 May 2020
Arrival," I remembered this movie from somewhere
","I remembered this movie from somewhere and then I realized that I had watched 30 minutes of it previously and turned it off because it was too boring.The movie is just that: boring. Nothing really ever happens. The movie is totally unrealistic in many ways. The protagonist keeps going in and out of the spaceship, but when she finally figures out what the aliens are there for (which is also a very strange reason), the camp is already being evacuated and the aliens leave again. The whole movie made no sense. I felt terribly disappointed afterwards.",3,0,3,16 May 2020
The Shawshank Redemption," It doesn't get much better than this
","This movie takes you through all kinds of emotions. It's an absolute classic. And with the two wonderful protagonist actors, it's definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen. I've watched it 3 or 4 times and never gets boring.",10,1,1,17 May 2020
Parasite," YES, YES, YES!!!
","Definitely one of the best movies I've seen in the recent years. The laughter, the suspense, the shock, ... and especially the hilarious twist in the middle! At the same time it presents a wonderful critique of society. I just LOVED it. Everything you'd expect of a Korean movie and more.",10,23,37,8 November 2019
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," And then random stuff starting happening...
","This is a truly unforgettable piece of crap movie and quite possibly the worst film I've seen in the past year.The film unfortunately lacks any sort of real storyline or character interaction. A lot of often mysterious things happen in the movie which, unfortunately, remain totally mysterious.I came into this film thinking it was a comedy, eventually having to laugh about twice during the whole two hours, which by the way was terribly long - after about 40 minutes I looked at my watch and was shocked that I would have to sit out an hour and a half more of this crap. The only reason I didn't get up and leave the theatre was that I was somewhere in the middle of a row and didn't want to disturb other people too much.Then I started wondering if perhaps the movie was a drama, but then again it couldn't be, as there wasn't really any *believable* drama that happened during the course of it, and there was nothing moving or enthralling that went on. Pieces of story lines were thrown at me during the film, but nothing was ever followed up on or properly explained or seemed to play any role.In the end, I'm not quite sure what this movie was, except maybe an inside joke, something which is funny if you are actually a film critic, an actor or Michael Keaton yourself, but not quite as much when you have actually paid money for to go and see it.",3,10,22,2 February 2015
