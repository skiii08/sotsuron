The Devil's Advocate," My First Pacino Flick
","This is the first movie I've ever seen with Al Pacino, and it made me a fan. I saw some of his other movies and loved those as well.  He is like Nicholson in the sense that he somewhat overacts, but also like Nicholson, he makes it work.  How can you not overact when you're playing the devil anyway?  Keanu Reeves also does a great job, even if his southern drawl comes and goes.  This is one of his first 'real adult roles,'  especially after 'Bill and Ted' and 'Love You to Death.'  Speed was an adult role of him sort of, but still not what is seen here.  It's a great movie, and the plot is simple, however I didn't completely understand what was happening to Milton at the end.  I also didn't like the 'second chance' ending that was given to Lomax, but what happened after it definitely made up for it. I give it an 8 out of 10",Null,1,2,16 October 1998
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," HILARIOUS
","I loved this movie.  It is a great version of the show, only it's 'Bigger, Longer and (somewhat) Uncut.'  It had a lot of humor that wouldn't be for everyone though.  If you're easily offended, then don't go see this, because it picks on just about everybody.  It was very artistic, the construction paper looks excellent on the big screen, and even though it's animated, it has some great special effects, especially Kenny's trip to Hell, and the Hell sequences in general.  The fire mixed very well with the animation. The musical numbers were mostly great, but they could have done without the Saddam Hussein song or the Satan song.  The rest were really funny.  The Saddam/Satan thing got kind of old, but Kenny giving advice to Satan was good.  There are a lot of hidden and 'in' jokes for fans of the show. Lots and lots of profanity.  And you finally get to see Kenny's face and hear his voice sans hood.  I'm still trying to decide if that was a good move or not. A GREAT cameo by George Clooney.  I recommend this movie for anyone with a strong stomach and a good sense of humor.  8/10 stars.",10,0,0,30 June 1999
American Pie," Not really all that funny
","I am one of the members of the target audiences for this movie, a horny teenaged male, but I didn't think this movie was all that great.  It is advertised as a comedy, which it is, there are some funny parts, but they threw in a lot of sentimental stuff and slow parts in here.  Like Something About Mary, I thought this movie was way overrated.  A few attempts at gross-out humor and some phallus jokes do not a good movie make.  South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut, which was released just a week before this, was a lot funnier, raunchier, and more fun to watch.  The funny parts do not make up for the slow boring parts.  The movie tries to make you laugh one second and then feel for the characters the next, but for me it didn't work. Good scenes:  The beginning scene, the pie scene, any scene with Jim and his father, the Jim and Michelle sex scene, the Fitch and the one guy's mother scene (MILF-Mother I'd Like to F**k), and the scene with Jim and Nadia.  Bad scenes: just about everything else.  The slow moving parts that try and give the characters feelings and stuff, which doesn't belong in a teen sex comedy.  So if you have a choice between this and South Park, if I was you I'd go with South Park.  Or, if you still want to see a good sex comedy, go out and rent Porky's Fast Times at Ridgemont High, or National Lampoon's Animal House.",1,5,12,9 July 1999
The Shining," Masterpiece
","There are a lot of horror films out there today, some of them eventually rise to the status of classics (Nosferatu, Dracula, etc.), others are cult classics (Evil Dead, Evil Dead II, etc., and others are pieces of crap that should never have been made (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Any Nightmare on Elm Street not directed by Wes Craven, etc.).  This is a classic, and a great one at that.  It's not close to the book by Stephen King, but it is a great standalone horror movie.  I admit it, I absolutely hated this movie the first time I saw it, but I watched it again.  And again.  And again.  I grew to love it.  It is an amazing piece of work, great cast of only about 6 real characters, and only three of them are main characters, the rest are supporting characters.  Jack Nicholson is a template for what many movie psychos should (and try, but rarely succeed) to be.  I read the book after I saw this movie, and I recommend seeing this first then reading the book. Then watch it again.  Lots of differences, but when you get down to it, it's the same story told by two different storytellers in their own way, King and Kubrick, much as the story of Cinderella differs from nationality to nationality.  You may think that your version is good, but at least take a glance at someone else's.  10 out of 10",Null,1,1,11 June 1999
The Game," Excellent thriller
","This is by far one of the best thrillers I've ever seen.  This movie is filled with plot twists, and everything works well together.  As you watch this movie you will be asking if a game is still being played or not.  While the chances of a sequel are slim to none, if one is made it will probably not star Michael Douglas, unless...",Null,1,2,9 August 1998
Event Horizon," not that bad!
","Sure it takes some stuff from other movies and uses it, but there aren't really that many movies anymore that don't borrow from other movies at least a little bit, mostly because just about everything has been done!  We've seen talking animals, tornadoes, dinosaurs, aliens, demons, sinking ships, explosions (although I gotta admit I can't get enough of those), mask wearing psychopaths, guns (those either), aliens, talking babies, car chases, aliens, more aliens, asteroids, etc. over and over again!  Sometimes making a good movie is taking stuff from other movies and rework them a little bit to make them better, thus adding a little bit of originality to stuff that's been seen before.  That's why many old TV shows are being remade.  Sure, many of the remakes suck, but what about 'The Fugitive,' 'The Brady Bunch,' and a few others I can't think of right now?  There are tons of movies about Titanic, yet nobody complained when the newest watered down, bad acted teeny-bopper version hit the theaters.  They made that piece of doodie the number one grossing movie!This movie is like 'The Shining' in space, but it adds a few plot elements here and there.  People complain about too much gore, and I think that those people are the moviegoers who call themselves horror movie fans but have only seen movies like 'Scream 1 & 2' and 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' and all the other new horror movies that don't live up to what horror used to be.  I'm not saying 'Scream' was bad, that was my first real horror movie too, but after that I went and checked out it's roots, 'Halloween,' the original 'Nightmare on Elm Street,' 'The Shining', and many others.  Had I seen these before I'd seen 'Scream' I would have looked at it as a totally different movie.  But I'm not talking about 'Scream,' I'm talking about 'Event Horizon.'It is more like the older horror movies, it doesn't water down the plot with a bunch of unnecessary and out-of-place humor.  It goes right where it should, the scary stuff.  Sure there might be a few plot holes, but who cares?I feel sorry for people who analyze things that are scientifically or historically wrong with a movie when they watch it, because they aren't watching the movie for the reasons they should.  There were tons of historical mistakes in Titanic.  Star Wars has a lot of scientific mistakes with it.  Jurassic Park probably couldn't really happen.  In almost all movies set in the future, people have the power to travel at the speed of light and create wormholes, but our weapons are never quite good enough to kill a few acid-bleeding aliens or giant tank bugs.  My point is, suspend your disbelief when you are watching a movie to be entertained, you just might actually like what you're watching.  After you've seen it a few times then look for what's wrong with it, but don't hate it for what is wrong about it, like it for what is right about it.  If you must hate a movie, at least make sure that it's because of terrible acting or a bad script or something like that.  Don't hate a movie because it's not scientific fact or because it's too gory for you.  I gave this 7 out of 10, because I LIKED IT DAMMIT!",Null,0,0,6 August 1999
Scream 2," Well...
","Scream 2 is a good movie, but it falls short in the fact that they moved the small town murders into a city.  The side characters aren't as well developed and the killer(s) don't have as much screen time as the killer in the first movie.  It is funnier than the original, and the death count is slightly bigger.  I would like to point out that the opening death scenes in this movie are a little better than the first, because of the way the first victim dies.  Now that was clever.  While this is a good follow up to Scream, I hope that Scream 3 goes back to the small town roots, and the killer(s) are a little more original.",Null,0,0,9 August 1998
The Waterboy," Only REALLY good the first time
","I saw this movie the first time with a few friends, and throughout I couldn't stop laughing, it was one of the funniest movies I'd ever seen.. until...The movie came out on pay-per-view.  I remembered how much I loved it so I decided to get it.  During the movie this time (the second time I'd seen it) it didn't seem as funny.  I even found myself squirming in my seat a little bit.  I don't know what happened, but I guess the magic in the movie died for me, it just wasn't as good the second time around.  It could have been because I wasn't with my friends this time, but I doubt it.I guess what I'm trying to say is that it kind of ran out of steam for me. I love Adam Sandler movies, but this one just wasn't as funny as Happy Gilmore or Billy Madison.  Watch it one time, you'll laugh pretty hard, but don't try to sit through the whole thing a second time, just the football parts.  6/10",6,1,1,6 August 1999
Scream," Another Great Horror Movie
","While Scream does take some horror elements from other movies it does it in its own way, which makes it a great movie.  If you haven't seen the sequel first and you haven't heard anything about it, you will be guessing through the entire movie who the killer is.  This movie is scariest when you're all alone at night with the lights off, especially in the middle of nowhere, trust me, this is how I first saw it.  Watch the director's cut if you can find it, it's a little better in my opinion.",7,0,0,9 August 1998
Halloween," A Great Movie
","This is a very good horror movie, and one of the reasons is because the plot was kept simple, with no real subplots.  Michael Myers is very scary because he kills silently and efficiently.  After part 2 the sequels became very complicated with cults and family members. (Not counting 3 because of the different plotline)  H20 goes back to the basic simplicity of the first two movies, and as far as I'm concerned there are only three Halloween movies, 1 2 and H20.",Null,0,0,9 August 1998
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Scary, very scary
","Yes, Nancy is god-loving Marie from the tv show 'Just the Ten of Us' but you can't tell it from this movie.  This is probably one of the scariest in the series, and Freddy is somehow more evil in this one.   This is a very good movie to see when you're in the mood for a scare, and it just may keep you awake for a while.  It also has probably the bloodiest death scene ever in a movie.",Null,0,0,9 August 1998
The Matrix," AMAZING
","This movie was excellent.  I was blown away by the effects and the plot. The actors were top notch, even Keanu.  I think this is one of the three roles I thought he was good in, the other two being his role in the Devil's Advocate and his role of a stoner in Love You to Death.  Lawrence Fishburne finally gets a role he deserves, I think he's underappreciated in his roles. So he's kinda got bad teeth, so did Austin Powers.  Trinity was YUMMY and the villains were evil.  The fighting scenes were really cool.",10,0,0,27 April 1999
Beetlejuice," I hope the afterlife is this much fun!
","I loved this movie from the first time I saw it when I was about 6 or 7, but 10 years later I'm fully able to appreciate the subtle adult humor.  This is probably my favorite 'scary' movie.  The plot is great and the actors really bring the characters to life, (or afterlife in most cases.)  The waiting room scenes are great, but my two most favorite sequences are the snake railing and the end where Beetlejuice lets loose.  I hope for a sequel, and yet I hope they never make a sequel at the same time, because it just wouldn't do it justice.  The cartoon didn't even do the movie justice, what happened to Adam and Barbara?  And why did Lydia become such good friends with Beetlejuice?  The special effects in this movie are excellent, especially for the time the movie was made.  Too bad filmmakers today don't rely more on their own creations rather than computers.",Null,0,2,19 January 1999
