Sucker Punch," Two hours of my life that I will never get back!
","The opening of this movie 'suckers' you in. There was almost no dialog but the visuals were intense and full of emotion. Very well done. Other than the opening, this movie was obviously written by and adolescent male. What woman would EVER, when finding a place in her mind away from the horrors of reality, choose to imagine herself as a whore?! The only way to accomplish your goals and be free is to dance erotically for your captors? Really?! What a great message to send to young girls.The writers really didn't spend any time on character development. They kill off almost everyone and you really don't care. It's like a move made from an elementary school students fantastical imagination, anime and the stolen idea of Inception. The dialog was lifeless and uninteresting. The only reprieves from the dark depressing atmosphere were some good CG fantasy action scenes that in themselves had nothing to do with anything. The movie really drug on and on and on and on and on.... really very boring. What a waste of money.",1,30,59,29 March 2011
