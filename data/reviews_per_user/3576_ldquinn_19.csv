The King's Speech," Can You Spell Oscar?
","Easily one of the best films of the year and, I would suppose, a lock for a number of award nominations. An excellent script, delivered on by a cast a marvelous actors. From the leads to the unspeaking parts of a myriad of onlookers - all were excellent.Colin Firth does a wonderful job as the Duke of York who ascends to the throne as George VI; yet, his performance, while outstanding, is surpassed a bit (in my mind) by that of Geoffrey Rush as the Duke's/King's speech therapist.Helena Bonham Carter has a major supporting role as The Duke's/King's wife, Elizabeth (known to us in later years as the Queen Mother). Carter handles this role with absolute perfection. Elegant, caring, protective; yet, at all times royal. Marvelous understatement in her performance.Even the young Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret and played nicely by two young actresses who are capable of using their eyes to carry a scene, not just the script. Their parts are small, but very important in setting the scene and drawing parallels between the Duke's/King's childhood and their own.Additionally, the director showed wonderfully the period between the wars.An excellent film that could be enjoyed by all as was evidenced by the response of the patrons at a very crowded theater at 10:15 AM on a Sunday morning. The film's hype brought them; but it will be the word of mouth that really will sell this film.",10,2,4,21 December 2011
Black Swan," My Best Film Of The Year!
","I absolutely loved this movie! Natalie Portman is exquisitely wonderful in this role - playing it with equal parts of vigor and nuance.Mila Kunis is magnificent! Barbara Hershey has her best role in years and more than does it justice.Winona Ryder has a small, yet pivotal, role and she really delivers.A thriller? A drama? A fantasy? A ballet film? All of these and more - no really good niche label for this one other than - a really excellent film with Oscar worthy performances.See this movie, enjoy immersing yourself in it and revel in wondering as you leave the theater - what did I just see? There are no pigeonholes as far as types of films for this one, other than that of excellent film.For those ballet fans out there, this is not a fully choreographed movie. The dance scenes are realistic and well done; but, if you are looking to see Swan Lake, this is not it.Breathtaking!",10,2,5,21 December 2011
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Star Wars Lives Again
","Many say that this is just a placeholder until Star Wars Episode VIII comes out later in 2017. If so, I found it quite worthy of the Star Wars label.Exciting story line, typically well developed story lines and excellent battle scenes.The music, for the first time, is not by John Williams. Rather, Michael Giacchino takes over and does a fine job maintaining the feel of Williams' music and supporting the action.I had to click on the spoiler box because I did have one minor complaint - the beginning lacked the regular explanatory crawl.",8,0,6,2 January 2017
Passengers," Very Enjoyable SciFi Movie
","Forget some of the lackluster reviews - this is a very enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours and it worth the trip to the big screen.Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt are enjoyable to watch and the story is not as far fetched as it may seem to some reviewers. Traveling through space, alone, figuring out how to live life in such a lonesome environment.Early on, I had the impression that Jennifer Lawrence may not have been fully involved; but, after her first scene or two, that feeling disappeared and she delivered her usual excellence.Head to the theater, get a big tub of popcorn, sit back, and enjoy a couple of hours of good escapism.",7,5,9,2 January 2017
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Very Funny Film
","A four star comedy, but a three star film; if you get my drift. They should have another Oscar for comedy films.A very funny movie throughout. All the characters are wonderful; as is the script. There are a couple of scenes that go on a bit longer than I felt they should; but, no to any serious detriment.This interlocking film is the 'Crash' of comedies - multiple story lines, weaving back and forth; finally all coming together at the end (well, not quite the end) in one hilarious and somewhat slapstick, yet still poignant scene.Not 'Blues Brothers' funny; but, I'll see it often, over the next few years, I am sure.",6,0,1,21 December 2011
Midnight in Paris," Owen Wilson Acts!
","What? This film is not a goofball comedy with Owen Wilson's whiney voice? OK, the voice is naturally whiney; but, Wilson really is a very good fit for this part.Is there great acting here? Not really - at least not by the major current day characters; but, go back to the turn of the century characters and it's wonderfully acted. Probably a function of more robust writing for the older scenes and a bit of a plodding script for current day.All that negativism behind me, this is really quite an enjoyable film - an interesting premise for a story, generally well written, excellent direction and amazing sets. How could they not be amazing, you say, after all, it is Paris. But, how many of us have seen Paris, let alone at the turn of the century.All in all, Woody Allen has done it again. A warm, successful, somewhat twisted film that is a great way to spend a couple of hours.",6,1,2,21 December 2011
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Good, But Not The Original or the Book
","I must confess that I write this with just a bit of bias. I had already seen the original Swedish film and felt that it was one of the top ten films of the last year or so; therefore, the new version had quite a hill to climb were it to rate better (in my mind) than the earlier version.If I could forget having seen the earlier version, I would have come away from this film with the comment that it was a well done film but didn't really do justice to the book.Both Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara did very good jobs in handling their parts as written. However, with a deeper script in this version, they acted with much less nuance than did Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace.The film began with a very dark, James Bondish, introduction which was really excellent. Throughout the film, the hand of the director, David Fincher, could be seen, working his magic on his vision of the book.This film varied from the book (as many films do) and from the earlier version - in most cases the changes added to the experience, although there were a couple of times the changes were a bit too far afield. I, personally, found the changed ending spoke more to how Fincher wanted the ending to be than did Stieg Larsson, the author.So, I guess the final tally is:1) If you read the book - This film, while not true to the book, is a very well done film that is well directed, well acted and generally well done.2) If you saw the original - This film doesn't reach the pinnacle that the earlier version did. It's still a good film; just not up to the standards of the original, especially in the acting department.",7,4,9,24 December 2011
No Strings Attached," Natalie Portman Is Wonderful
","Funny, enjoyable and a bit of a turn around of the standard guy doesn't want commitment flick. In this case, it's the woman, Natalie Portman, shying away from anything other than quick, no strings attached, casual sex.Natalie Portman does a wonderful job with this character and she raises the quality level of those other actors in the film. Yes, even Ashton Kutcher actually acts in this film. Well, perhaps not all the way through - his performance improves throughout and he ends the film well. Olivier he's not, but he is better here than in all of his other films (combined).Well written and very well directed. Even given the free wheeling sexual nature of the film, there is nary a skin shot, except for Kutcher's butt early in the film; yet, somehow the passion and sexual trysts are totally believable.This is not an award winning piece for Portman (unlike Black Swan); still, she does bring a level of class to the film.Well worth a trip to the theater for a couple of hours of fun and laughter.",6,0,3,21 December 2011
The Fault in Our Stars," Should Be Multiple Oscar Nominations Here
","Shailene Woodley is 2014's Jennifer Lawrence. The Fault In Our Stars is magnificent. Great writing, wonderful direction, marvelous editing and Shailene Woodley.The only question is - will the Oscar nominators remember her performance in a mid year release film?Who is Ansel Elgort? A young, new actor who, hopefully, will not be a one hit wonder - wonderful facial expressions added so much to the film and his smile is infectious.I must ward you that this is a tear jerker - not just at the end; but, throughout the film. The emotion builds throughout the film and the soundtrack had competition from the sniffling and nose blowing pervasive throughout the theater from about the halfway point on.Definitely a must see film for 2014 and years to come!",10,0,4,7 June 2014
Drive," Good Gosling
","Ryan Gosling does a wonderful job in this interesting take on the silent; yet not brooding, character who dabbles in both the criminal and honest world. He's not conflicted, just appears to be slightly less comfortable in the real world where he has to actually interact with others. He does a wonderful job portraying a character that, while not having great multiple depths, does have two distinctly different roles to play; which he does admirably with slight differences in each personality.Some of the crooks are slightly lame; but one or two personify calm, deliberate, malice - as a business requirement almost; definitely not the personification of evil. Carey Mulligan does a fine turn in her pivotal; yet not major role.A good one for home viewing...",6,2,4,24 December 2012
Hidden Figures," Great Acting - Fun Movie
","Hidden Figures is the story of three little known women who played a crucial role in the early days of the US space program. Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monáe were all wonderful in their roles; each bringing specific personalities to their characters.Taraji P. Henson is a mathematics wunderkind who is called upon to assist in calculating the math requires for launches and recoveries. A single mother of three daughters, she graciously and calmly works through the difficulties of being a lone black woman in a department full of white men in the racially segregated state of Virginia. Her calmness breaks in one scene and she wonderfully states, quite loudly, the obstacles she is forced to endure and overcome. This is quite a contrast from her normally calm dignity. As a side story, she is also involved in a burgeoning romantic relationship and she shows another totally side of herself - that of a shy, demure woman, which she carries off perfectly.Octavia Spencer, a very strong actress, does a wonderful job as a black woman with the responsibilities of a supervisor that she is not allowed to have the title or compensation for. She deals with her supervisor, Kirsten Dunst, with patience and tolerance and delivers what I think was the finest line in the film in response to Dunst's comment that, 'I have nothing against y'all.' Spencer replies, 'I know you probably believe that.' Surrounding me in the auditorium was a subdued murmur of knowing assent and acknowledgment from the audience. Clearly, the black moviegoers all have had that thought, probably more often than one would like to think. As a white male, the sounds of the audience gave me pause and had great impact. That line, alone, made this movie worth seeing.Janelle Monáe plays a woman with the talent to be a NASA engineer, who has to jump through hoops to get there. She provides the bit of lightness that keeps this film lighter than the topic may generally have dictated.Without exception, the supporting cast excels - from Kevin Costner, the boss who just wants to get the job done and tolerates no impediments; to Jim Parsons, the engineer who always insists on following the rules - NASA's as well as his personal rules based on his biases; to Mahershala Ali, who plays Henson's love interest.This movie is well worth viewing on many levels - as history, as a treatise on segregation and race relations, and as an example of how determination can overcome the most difficult of obstacles.Not only was this an excellent film; it was also a film that I was glad I saw.",8,16,39,8 January 2017
Friends with Benefits," Fantastic Comedy!!!
","Well, if they ever decide to give an Oscar for a comedy, they should use this film as a guide. Kunis and Timberkale are amazing - who would ever have thought!Of course, they could not have been as successful without such a wonderful script.Always cute, sometimes laugh-out-load hysterical.Patricia Clarkson will take those old enough back to the 60s/70s and Woody Harrelson is outrageously fantastic as a gay sports editor - a tour de force for him!Perhaps a bit slow once or twice (but not for long) and maybe a bit off script in one scene; but, altogether - a fantastic movie.OK, OK, I know it's a rom-com guys; but, you will really get the humor. See this one with a friend!!!What? You're still reading - get up and go see this movie! Enjoy a laugh or two...",8,1,3,21 December 2011
Invictus," Freeman IS Mandela
","Morgan Freeman is Nelson Mandela. The only question is whether he actually had to act the part or whether he really is like that. Sheer perfection!Matt Damon - good job, maybe better than good. Damon, plus 40-50 pounds still looks small for the role - thank goodness for camera angles that give him a bit more stature.South Africa - the politics - the geographical scene - all well rendered. The distrust between the races is palpable throughout the film - yet is always believable and not pandered to.Clint Eastwood, the director, may be the one least praised by the masses for his effort; yet his direction is subtle and easy and makes the film so much better - his should be the Oscar nomination...",8,2,3,1 January 2010
La La Land," Singing and dancing and acting, oh my...
","I initially really wanted to see this film on the big screen; but, as wide release got closer, all the rave reviews put me off a bit - was it all hype? Were the Hollywood powers-that-be pushing the reviewers extra hard?Well, regardless of my doubts, I went anyway and I was glad I did. This film hearkened back to the song and dance musicals of days gone by. But, with the added twist of using real actors; not professional singers and dancers. I felt this added a great deal to the movie - the characters were real people - people that sang and danced well; but, not perfectly. The producers could well have dubbed professional voices ala Marni Nixon for Natalie Wood in West Side Story; but, not doing so made this film so much more real.Ryan Gosling is a very good actor. After seeing his work in the film, I'd have to say he is better than good. Has he made it to the pantheon of great actors? I'm not sure; but, his performance in La La Land was outstanding - he ran the full gamut of emotions and he can do more with a sly glance than many actors with better pedigrees.Gosling had the perfect partner in Emma Stone; who, at times, appeared to be channeling Audrey Hepburn. Her eyes can evoke more emotion than almost anyone. In my opinion, she was quite excellent.The film is fun and quite emotional at times - not a full box of tissues; but, a good handful would be nice to have.But wait - there's more... This is somewhat of a musical, after all and I found the score to be absolutely perfect. Unlike most films, where the music can be setting a background mood, the music in La La Land is integral to the plot and the quality of the score raises the film to another level.My suggestion would be to see this film now, on the biggest screen you can find. This is not a film for the home TV, unless you happen to have a full size Hollywood screening room in the basement.",9,3,8,8 January 2017
Burlesque," Christina Aguilera Is Excellent!
","This is a fun movie! Cher is Cher - only a couple of singing numbers - one a bit pedestrian; the other a show stopper, a bit melancholy, but perfect - she can still sing!Now, a singer? Perhaps Christina Aguilera? No perhaps! She takes over this film and makes it hers with her surprisingly good acting and powerful voice.OK, so Cher can still sing a bit and Christina Aguilera can sing a lot. Is there to be no mention of great acting? Hold the presses! Can anyone spell Stanley Tucci??? He is no less than magnificent. An absolutely perfect role for him which he takes and runs with - certainly supporting Oscar nomination material.The story is a bit worn - girl from small town America goes to the big city to make her name as a singer. Against all odds, everything falls into place for her and she succeeds. The club owner faces losing the club; yet, thanks to small town girl, saves it and makes it better.Totally clichéd; yet, this movie is a lot of fun to watch. Toe tapping tunes (well, OK, a bit more than toe tapping), success against adversity, small town girl makes good - what else do you need?What else? How about fantastic dance numbers? Pounding, vibrant music?Oops! Almost forgot - this is a movie with Cher, right? Suffice it to say that the costuming was outrageously wonderful.All in all, this is a wonderful film - light weight, low-key and totally enjoyable.",8,1,2,21 December 2011
The Blind Side," Sandra Bullock in her prime...
","Trite? Yes. A sports movie? Yes. Cute kids? Yes. Superficial plot? Yes. All the things that point to a mediocre film? Yes.That said, this is a wonderful Sandra Bullock film - not anything you have to think about too much to enjoy - just lean back, dip your hand into some faux buttered popcorn and enjoy a couple of hours of relaxation - some grins, some laughs, some tears, some hoping the good guys win...High art? No. Oscars? No. Rave reviews by the high and mighty newspaper reviewers? No.That said, I can only say that this film is total enjoyment - no effort watching, just pleasure, escape and all the other wonderful things that make the real world disappear.Plus, the story is true (with a bit of dramatic license)...",7,1,2,1 January 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Oh no, the last one...
","Four stars would be a bit of a stretch; but, it is a really fine culmination to the full series so it gets a really strong three stars.By far the best transition from episode to episode, even given the time between parts 1 and 2. Simply put, merely a continuation with only a couple of seconds from the end of part one - no voluminous credits, just the title and then right into the film.Relatively true to the book, as were most of the others.Not Oscar worthy like LOTR; but a really fine film, nonetheless.No great acting here, but the cinematography is great although it's a shame to see the destruction of Hogwart's, which leant so much magic to the earlier films.A nice touch at the end, 19 years later...",7,0,1,21 December 2011
The Fighter," Not Just A Boxing Movie
","Well acted production tells the story of one family, two brothers - all of whom have their own issues to be dealt with. A pretty good portrayal of a hard scrabble life in Lowell, MA.Dialogue, script, acting and direction are all good; but, nothing really struck me as benefiting all the hype this film has generated.This is not a boxing movie; rather, a well done character study.Worth a couple of hours in the theater with good popcorn - an escape only - you'll not leave the theater reveling about the film - maybe not even thinking of it once you get as far as your car.Three stars for the acting only, not the entire package.",6,6,9,21 December 2011
Up in the Air," A very good George Clooney film.
","This film has been touted by many as truly being Oscar worthy in many categories. While I found it very well done in all facets - directing, acting, writing, etc.; I feel the topic may be a bit too depressing to garner the wide spread voting bloc needed for true Oscar contention.Regardless of the pervasive negativity of the topic, it really is a well done film that softly delves into the mores of an individual whose sole purpose in life is that of a traveling terminator for rent who is generally devoid of the need for meaningful human interaction.The intrepid road warrior - racking up the miles - but; to what end? A nice character study, acted with great skill by Clooney. Among his best efforts.Ah, but for the topic... A worthy acting effort.",7,1,6,1 January 2010
