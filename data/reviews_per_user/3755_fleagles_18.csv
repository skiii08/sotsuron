Gremlins," Funny light horror film
","This is a light, funny chiller about an exotic pet gone bad - a Mogwai- that becomes evil on Christmas after very specific rules are broken.  There are good special effects and physical comedy - it makes the perfect dark Christmas movie.  Incidentally, this and Indiana Jones & The Temple of Doom were the films that forced the MPAA to begin the PG-13 rating.  It does seem a bit dated, though, since its 1984 release.",8,0,1,23 December 1999
Erin Brockovich," Good Roberts performance in important film
","Julia Roberts delivers a terrific performance in Erin Brockovich, a film based on the true story of the title character, a down-on-her-luck single mom who, as a legal researcher, found documents which led to the largest legal settlement in history.  Brockovich, with her plunging necklines, her determined quest to become something more of herself, and her cursing at everyone, is quite a character, and Roberts is probably the only actress that could take this salty woman and make her so likable.  Albert Finney as Ed Masry, her disheveled boss, and Aaron Eckhart, as the biker next door who slowly becomes Erin's boyfriend, all do good work here.  Vote: 7",8,0,0,10 April 2000
Meet the Parents," DeNiro and Stiller are a great team
","Ben Stiller has become the poster boy for neuroses, and here he is very good as the horribly-named Greg Focker (there are other name issues).  Meet The Parents is the story of his trip to the parents of his girlfriend (Teri Polo), and her parents (Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner).  Jack takes a particular interest in Greg's background, and as the lies grow, so does the comedy.  Meet The Parents is very funny and features great performances from DeNiro, Stiller, and Owen Wilson as Polo's ex, and is ably directed by Jay Roach.Vote: 7",8,0,0,4 December 2000
The 13th Warrior," Absolutely awful
","An absolute mess.  The plot makes no sense, the special effects look cheesy, the acting is awful, and the dialogue is laugh-out-loud horrible.  The only good scene is Banderas' deciphering of his fellow fighters' language(s). I've heard that this film sat on the studio shelf for several years Â– they must have been desperate to release it at all.  Vote: 2",2,1,3,4 May 2000
Glory," A breathtaking story of heroism, told beautifully
","A truly breathtaking historical drama.  This film centers around the African-American Massachusetts regiment that became the first to fight in the Union army.  These were men who were only too eager to fight against the hated Confederacy, but who also needed the education to become soldiers.Their leader is Col. Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick), who is chosen to manage this `project'.  Cary Elwes is his friend, a major who had a more difficult time adjusting to new troops.  Morgan Freeman plays one soldier who possesses the maturity and leadership for this unit, Andre Braugher (the great Frank Pembleton from `Homicide: Life on the Street') is a free Massachusetts black man who volunteers for the regiment faces some uncomfortable changes both inside and outside himself.  And then there is Denzel Washington's Oscar-winning performance as one stubborn soldier who is as difficult as can be, but becomes a soldier worthy of his unit.Directed by the brilliant Edward Zwick, Glory features a cast and crew that managed to excel at everything.  James Horner's score mixed with the Harlem Boys Choir's voices, melt with the images on the screen of troops that were ready to sacrifice everything for their cause. Perhaps above all is Freddie Francis' cinematography.  His photography, whether of battle, the troops themselves, or the overall atmosphere of war, brings the audience into this film with a spirit that is rare.There have always been some grumblings about Broderick as the choice to play an Army Colonel, but he plays Shaw with maturity and poise.  The rest of the cast are all terrific, and all deliver excellent performances.This is truly a film to watch again and again, to see the horrors of the Civil War, and the heroism of African-Americans ready for battle, and the bravery of the white leaders that led them there.Vote: 10",10,0,0,5 May 2000
U-571," Best part: The tension and the effects
","Jonathan Mostow, who so successfully created an atmosphere of tension and suspense in Breakdown, does the same fine work here in U-571.  In this film, Matthew McConaughey leads a team of naval officers to steal a German encoder known as the Enigma.  They take over a German sub, and attempt to finish their mission, when major problems ensue. (don't want to give anything away)The best part of this movie is the effects and the tension that it created within the submarine.  The special effects are amazing, the camera work is terrific as you feel the dizzy, claustrophobic sense of tension aboard this ship.  That being said, it's the type of movie where you only realize afterwards what was missing.First, there are problems of historical accuracy: Although the end credits thank the real Navy efforts to steal the German encoders during the War, it was the British, and never the American Navy, who were involved.  This isn't a terrible thing, but it's crediting the wrong people. There are a number of other plot holes as well.Second is the acting.  With several exceptions, most notably McConaghey's solid performance, there is some bad casting and dry acting.  Harvey Keitel ?  He is listed as Chief Klough, but then why does he report to McConaughey's Lt. Tyler ?  Bill Paxton is wooden, and Erik Palladino whines through his role and is annoying.The suspense and effects are great, and it makes for a good `popcorn' movie, but U-571 could have been better.Vote: 7",7,0,1,31 May 2000
American Beauty," Chilling, original film
","This is a terrific film, full of great acting, and one of the best (and most original scripts) of the year. Kevin Spacey (one of my favorite actors), Annette Bening, Chris Cooper, and the rest of this cast give fantastic performances, with a story that is at times funny, chilling, pathetic, and probably features every other emotion.  Alan Ball, a writer best known for sitcom work, and Sam Mendes, a theater director who debuts as a film director here, have a tremendous sense of visual style, originality, and a story to wring you out.  Thomas Newman's music adds to the starkness of this film.American Beauty is the type of film where you exit the theater knowing that you've experienced is terrific, but can't feel exuberant about what you've just seen, because of its subject matter.  No matter - make sure you get to see a true 'American Beauty.'",10,0,0,19 October 1999
Being John Malkovich," Definitely original and fun
","Being John Malkovich is easily one of the most original films ever made. It's plot is twisted and difficult to explain; a financially failing puppeteer, Craig Schwartz (John Cusack), works on the 7 Â½ (!) floor of a building filing papers and discovers a portal to the actor John Malkovich's brain.  His sexy, tempestuous co-worker played by Catherine Keener is along for the ride, and his wife (Cameron Diaz) is involved with both.  Then there is Schwartz's boss (Orson Bean) who also has a special interest in Malkovich.  The idea behind this film is brilliant, but the most fun of all comes from watching Malkovich himself endure this bizarre situation. The cast and the special effects are the two best features of this film, and Malkovich should win some type of award for being such a good sport. Unfortunately, the story sputters a little near the end, but for its originality and bizarreness , this is definitely worth seeing.  Spike Jonze has made his directing debut that will be remembered for a long time.",8,0,0,19 January 2000
American History X," An amazing film in its story and acting
","Edward Norton gives an incredible performance as Derek Vinyard, a neo-Nazi who goes to prison for murder, and his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) who worships Derek, and who is heading along the same disturbing path.  This is a beautifully photographed and wonderfully written movie that takes a very strong subject, and forms it all into a truly unique film. Norton is amazing - He has such as tremendous range as an actor that it so difficult that he also played a neurotic New Yorker in Woody Allen's Everyone Says I Love You.  His buffed-up physique, shaved head, and goatee all make him look incredibly realistic as a Los Angeles skinhead (and worried some that skinheads would become chic).  His performance is incredible, as are the standout supporting performances from Avery Brooks as the black teacher who believes in both Derek and Danny, and Stacy Keach (who seems determined to break his image as Mike Hammer) as the head white supremacist in town.  First-time feature director Tony Kaye (who also served as cinematographer) directs and photographs this film beautifully, and Anne Dudley's score is one to remember. This film will make you think about racism, Neo-Nazism, politics & race, and where hate really comes from - it is passed along from parent to child.Vote: 8",8,0,1,7 September 2000
Mission: Impossible II," Great action, but bad plot
","I knew going into this movie that it was going to be easy viewing, but I thought it would have more of a plot.  Sure, the action scenes are great in that classic John Woo, ultra-choreographed way, but the plot isn't original or have much to it.  Dougray Scott tries as the villain, but he's not scary at all, just sort of mildly irritable.  After all, this is a villain who demands stock options as part of his bounty. (Truly, a sign of the times, and the audience laughed at that one.) Thandie Newton, who I had never seen before, is certainly beautiful, but she carries two expressions on her face through the entire movie, and resembles Ally McBeal in a tighter T-shirt. And then there's Tom.  His character is more of a James Bond clone than the character is the original movie; I admire his guts and fearlessness for doing several scenes (especially the opening one), and the truth is, he's not bad.  This just could have been much more.  I did like Anthony Hopkins, though.  He brings class to whatever he appears in.",6,0,0,13 July 2000
The Insider," An exciting look at a disturbing story
","The Insider succeeds as a thriller while tackling the difficult job of a controversial news story.  It is about Jeffrey Wigand, the Brown & Williamson executive who wanted to tell of Big Tobacco's lies to CBS' 60 Minutes, and that network's refusal to air the story.  Russell Crowe gives a fantastic performance that not only should be remembered at Oscar time, but should guarantee that he will become one of the top actors in the future. Al Pacino is very good (as usual) as Lowell Bergman, the renegade producer who fights with CBS and Wigand in order to save Wigand's story.  Christopher Plummer mimics Mike Wallace perfectly, and the rest of the cast are all good.  But most of all, it is Michael Mann's direction that makes this film work.  It moves at a frenetic pace, and pushes the audience to feel the tension and frustration of the story.  This film has not performed well financially, and that's sad; audiences may feel that they already know this story.  That's too bad - The Insider is a terrific film which will be remembered for years to come.",9,0,0,23 December 1999
Toy Story 2," Great film for adults and children
","A terrific, smart, funny movie.  Toy Story 2 tells the story of how Woody become separated from Andy, and the toys' determination to rescue him from Al, a greedy toy owner voiced by (and looking like) Wayne Knight ('Newman' from Seinfeld). Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, and the rest of the cast are back as Woody, Buzz, Hamm, Rex and the other toys from Andy's room. In addition, there are also a number of new characters including Jessie, Stinky Pete, and Wheezy. While this film contains some humor that only adults will get, it is, like its predecessor, largely geared for children, and teaches some valuable lessons about friendship and devotion to others.  Terrific animation, great vocal work, and a fun movie for anyone of any age.",10,0,1,13 December 1999
The Hurricane," Terrific story and well acted
","The story of boxer Rubin `Hurricane' Carter is a fascinating and controversial one, and it has been brilliantly brought to life in Norman Jewison's film `The Hurricane.'  Denzel Washington, in a terrific performance, portrays the New Jersey boxer who was twice wrongly convicted for murder, and finally released in 1985.   The movie tells Carter's story, from the rough streets of Paterson, New Jersey, his days as a champion prizefighter, and the prison where he spent so many years.  Washington, always a great actor, gives a performance that is full of the power and emotion that is Mr. Carter.  The rest of the cast is also very good, especially the great character actor Dan Hedaya as the Javert-like detective obsessed with putting Carter away.  Which leads to an important point: As has been reported, there is much in this film that is true, and there are characters and storyline that are not.  One example is Hedaya's character, who is supposedly meant to be representative of the many corrupt police and prosecutorial officials involved in this case.  Even with this controversy, however, The Hurricane is both beautifully directed and acted.",8,0,2,10 February 2000
The Fly," Terrific Goldblum and effects, bad script
","Creepy film from David Cronenberg, who has made a specialty of creepy films (Dead Ringers, Scanners, Existenz).  Jeff Goldblum stars as Seth Brundle, a scientist who is mastering teleportation, but who accidentally crosses his genetic code with a housefly's, creating a terrifying hybrid.   Geena Davis plays a reporter who is slowly falling for Goldblum, her subject.This is Goldblum's best performance of his career.  An actor who often seems laid-back, Goldblum here is anything but.  His intensity shows as a man who undergoes a terrifying transformation into a disgusting creature.  His anger and frustration cross with his scientific visions, and he thus creates a very sympathetic character.  Additionally, the makeup artists created truly amazing effects and deserve every ounce of the Oscar that they won.That being said, it is unfortunate that the script is obvious and by-the-numbers.  You can see the resolution coming a mile away.  It feels like most of the energy in this film went into the effects and technology, instead of the script.Vote: 6",7,2,4,30 May 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," A disappointing mess
","As a fan of Stanley Kubrick, I had been eagerly anticipating this film.  I can now say how disappointed I am.  While Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Sydney Pollack, and the rest of this cast are all solid, the story, and especially the way it is delivered both takes forever to develop and frustrates. 
The dialogue takes forever for the actors to say, and I often felt like if I made hand gestures, it might help to speed up the story out of their mouths.
Certain aspects of the story, characters, and entire scenes serve no purpose at all in this film, other than to elongate it.However, as for the now-famous orgy scene, it is certainly one of the most fascinating and bizarre sequences in recent film.I can't help but feel sorry for the cast and crew, who, while they put forth such a strong effort, end up in such a mess.",7,0,0,3 August 1999
The Matrix," Unique sci-fi action
","Many moviegoers have voted The Matrix as one of the greatest films of all time (current ranking on the IMDB 250: 31st), but it does not deserve that ranking.  It is however, a very good film for its genre(s); a sci-fi thriller with lots of martial arts. I won't try to explain the plot, because I only started to understand the story about an hour into this film, and even then am not sure what was going on. That being said, The Matrix is arguably Keanu Reeves' best film. Reeves, who is constantly derided as a mumbling surfer dude, fits his role perfectly as a hacker/possible savior of mankind.  The martial arts sequences, while somewhat campy, are amazing, and the video-game-like action sequences are certainly unique (did he really need that many guns, though ?)  Laurence Fishburne and the always good Joe Pantoliano are also very good in this unique film.  Among the best films ever ?  Not by a long shot.",8,0,0,25 September 2000
Gladiator," Wonderful Crowe combined with amazing action
","Russell Crowe has a definite presence on the big screen and he makes Gladiator his own as Maximus, a general in ancient Rome.  Beginning with an impressively staged battle in Germany, Crowe embodies this warrior with his whole being.  The favorite of Richard Harris' Caesar to take over Rome, Crowe refuses, and ends up as a slave whose only existence is to fight in the arenas, where most of the warriors die very young deaths.  Maximus sees this as his chance to redeem himself.Besides Crowe's terrific performance, Harris and the late Oliver Reed, as Profumo, Maximus' master, deliver wonderful performances.The special effects are amazing as well, from the battle and action sequences, to the renderings of the Colosseum and ancient Rome.  Gladiator is a top-notch action film, and one that signals Russell Crowe as a major star on the rise.",9,0,0,20 June 2000
The Wedding Singer," A charming, funny, 80's tale
","Adam Sandler is at his most likable as Robbie Hart, a wedding singer whose fiance left him at the altar.  He meets Julia (Drew Barrymore) and must persuade her that he's the right one for her, and away from her scummy fiance. It's a simple plot and a simple movie, but it works perfectly. Both Sandler and Barrymore are charming and funny, the supporting cast is terrific, especially Christine Taylor and an unbilled Steve Buscemi, and the 80's clothes, music, and cultural references are very funny.Vote: 8",8,1,1,5 July 2000
