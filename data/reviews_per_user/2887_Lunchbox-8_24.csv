Vertigo," Definitely one of the greatest mystery/ thrillers of all time
","Vertigo is one of the greatest films ever made.  It provides a very interesting and catchy plot (standard of Hitchcock) and a surprising and amazing ending.  Hitchcock truly was the master at his game and Vertigo is an example of this.  It's a great, fun film to watch with great setting, characters, and plot.",Null,2,4,21 May 2001
Meet the Parents," One of, if not, the funniest movies of 2000!
","'Meet the Parents' was a hilarious movie.  One of the reasons is because it was well casted.  Ben Stiller, everything bad happens to him, he's intimidated and insulted constantly: is that not what you think of when you think of Ben Stiller, in movies like 'There's Something About Mary.'  Robert Deniro, mysterious, seemingly conniving, an over-all sense of intimidation and violence: is that also not what you think of when you hear his name.    If you like movies where bad things constantly happen to someone, like in 'The Big Lebowski,' you'll like this movie.  This movie is full of great scenes as well as great lines.  Greg Focker has to be the most unlucky character in movie history.  All this bad stuff happens to him although he's completely innocent.  And the movies not just a bunch of situations with bad stuff happening to Ben Stiller, it has a good ending that ties together the whole movie and makes all the bad stuff worth while.    This is a great date movie if you're sick of all that genuine romance stuff!  Enjoy!",9,0,0,23 January 2001
Se7en," Intriguing crime drama
","Se7en is simply a great movie. It provides a unique motive for aserial killer: to kill violators of the seven deadly sins.  Is a personjustified in killing if doing it for the greater cause of society?  Oris it merely a veneer used to excuse morbid pleasures? Se7en discussesthis moral question.  Besides the plot, he characters are not badeither.  Brad Pitt plays a defiant, rookie-like cop who partners withthe wise, veteran Morgan Freeman.  Brad Pitt of course acts to the bestof his ability.  It's too bad that he has achieved the taboo status ofbeing a heart-throb.  Morgan Freeman though is respected for his greatroles in the past.   The greatest part of the story ,though, is the ending which isn'texactly a surprise but still is great how it ties the story together.   Another good attribute of the movie are the sets.  They fulfill theirtask of being depressing, dark, and just something that you'd see on arainy, dismal day in the city.  Even the scenes in the large sunnyfields seem to be oddly depressing and dismal.   Watch a great film: Se7en.",9,0,0,20 March 2001
The Big Lebowski," A funny movie for those who enjoy wacky characters, hilarious dialogue, and wandering plots!
","The Big Lebowski is simply put as a hilarious movie.  The characters are funny for many reasons.  The Dude, minding his own buisiness, walks into his house and is ruffed up by two thugs.  As they leave, one of them p***es on his rug.  After that event, a bunch of other bad things happen to him. He's just this incredibly confused, unemployed pothead and his entire life is changed just because he has the same name of a millionaire who's wife owes money all over town!  The plot wanders and changes so much that sometimes you have to pause the movie and ask someone next to you 'What is going on?' The characters in this movie, especially John Goodman's character, Walter Sobchak, are just so funny that it's hard to describe.  Walter's always rambling on about something stupid that has nothing to do with the subject, like how he fought in Vietnam, and scolding Donnie for just asking a question.  This movie has a good plot, good characters, and good dialogue. The music also isn't bad- Creedence Clearwater Revival (or 'Creedence' as referred to in the movie), Bob Dylan, and Kenny Rogers are included, not too shabby.  RENT THIS MOVIE!  YOU'LL BE SATISFIED!  Enjoy!",9,0,0,16 January 2001
Unbreakable," Satisfactory, Unique Film
","'Unbreakable,' written and directed by the creator of 'The Sixth Sense,' was a good movie.  Although the plot was somewhat slow and the big action scenes were few and far between, it came out good in the end.  'Unbreakable' is the story of a man with a unique power and a man who tries to inform him of it.  As I already said, the plot was pretty slow.  At some times i even consisdered walking out of the movie because I thought the plot was wandering.  Some scenes involve Bruce Willis trying to recconcile his marriage and come off as pretty boring.  You do grow to like the characters though, just like in 'The Sixth Sense.'  You can absolutely tell that the writer and director is the same guy from 'The Sixth Sense' for two reasons.  The first reason is that the movie has plenty scenes which wander from the plot and focus on the lives of the characters instead of the matter at hand. Some scenes are just times when the characters are silent, thinking about something, and leaving the audience waiting for some action, just like in 'The Sixth Sense.'  These scenes aren't exactly bad, if that's the impression you're getting, because they help you to think of the characters more as people, people you might know or meet at the supermarket, instead of people in a movie.  These scenes also wander away from the plot, and prevent you from thinking of the surprise ending, and what could happen.  For example, all those scenes with Bruce Willis and his wife in 'The Sixth Sense' made you think of them, and the healing of their marriage, instead of realizing the truth about Bruce Willis.    The second reason that let's you know that 'Unbreakable' was created by the writer and director of 'The Sixth Sense' is the ending.  Don't worry, I won't give away the big ending like a lot of people probably did in 'The Sixth Sense.'  In fact, I think the writer purposely made the ending more complicated than in it's predecessor so no one would give it away.  And believe me, you won't know it.  I bet the entire movie you'll be thinking about the ending, and about how you could figure it out, but you won't.  M. Night Shamaylan just pulled the carpet out from under you- I mean this is 'The Usual Suspects' style.  Well, I reccomend this movie to anyone who likes long drawn out movies with fabulous endings.                              My Rating: 8/10",8,0,0,20 January 2001
Memento," Without a doubt, by far the best movie I've seen in the theaters in over a year
","Memento truly was a unique movie.  First of all, the major and most engaging attribute to the movie was the non-linear, backwards time-line that the movie was based on.  It really was the only successful way to present all the facts in the movie but still keep up on the whole memory loss factor.  It was really cool though because it was so confusing.  It wasn't really that confusing but it was enough for (sorry for breaking the golden rule) me to speak out in the theater to my buddy and ask him for some concise guidance.  But with the backwards plot, there was a telephone discussion between the main character and a soon-to-be-known other character.    In short, Memento was a fascinating movie that took a seemingly simple plot (SEEMINGLY!) and turned it into a truly unique and rewarding movie theater experience.",10,0,1,5 June 2001
L.A. Confidential," Possibly one of the best crime dramas ever made
","LA Confidential is simply a great movie.  It yeilds an award winning cast, superb plot, great action, and masterful art direction.  By art direction I mean the way that the movie really does seem to take place in 1953.  The costumes and hairstyles, the car models and years, the intense Los Angeles background, etc.  It all comes out to make the movie have a great and unique image.  Many compare the image of LA Confidential to that of The Untouchables.  One major flaw: LA Confidential was a serious picture with great charcaters while Untouchables had those charcaters who had that whole comical image about them, like the bookman at the end, or Capone's cliched groupies who pretty much seemed like they came directly from an old Dick Tracy cartoon clip.  Besides the sincere and successful image, the plot is absolutely superb, nearly perfect.  It combines deep and confusing mystery with a great dramatic story of cops.  Besides the plot, the cast is great too.  Kevin Spacey, one of my favorite actors, functions very well as the fame hungry and funny cop Jack 'Big V' Vincennes.  Guy Pearce, featured in the great thriller Memento, is a very good newcomer who plays the by the book Ed Exely.  Also, Russel Crowe is great as the violent but principled cop Wendell 'Bud' White.  Altogether, LA Confidential is a great movie.  It is definitely one of the best movies made in the 90's and possibly the best ploce drama ever.",10,1,2,7 June 2001
Full Metal Jacket," Kubrick's Vietnam Masterpiece
","Stanley Kubrick is synonomous with genius.  His films truly are works of art in that they have countless themes and meanings.  And all those profound themes are hidden under highly enjoyable movies.  Movies like 'The Shining,' '2001: A Space Odessey,' and 'Path of Glory' are great examples of Kubrick's utter brilliance for conceiving films.       
  'Full Metal Jacket' is one of Stanley Kubrick's greatest films.  It is literally divided into two chapters: the training, and when the training is used.  The first part of the film, the training, portrays vividly the incredible mental and physical terror that the would-be marines go through. At times, the training seems unbearable, sadistic, and cruel, but in reality, that is exactly what they needed.  Stanley Kubrick shows how the Marine training camp dehumanized the trainees into killing machines.  Many people who have seen the first half of the movie describe it as being 'one good line after another.'  They're describing the lines of the drill instructor, played by former drill insrtuctor Lee Ermey.  In the pre-production of the film, Kubrick told Ermey to just make it real, something that he did with great skill.  One of the best scenes in the first part was when the marines gathered for the 'persuasive' meeting with Private Pyle.  Even when they weren't in any training or combat, the marines gathered and executed the mission with total perfection and synchronicity, the sign of a true military force.  The first half of 'Full Metal Jacket' is perhaps one of the greatest chapters in film history in that it showed development and dehuminization like only Kubrick could.  The second half of 'Full Metal Jacket' is when the intense training goes into use: combat.  The battle scenes in this movie were just spectacular. Violent and brutal yes, they showed correctly Kubrick's style: dark but true. If you like great combat sequences and action, you'll like this film. If you like artistic films but are sick of lighter, somewhat dull plots, then 'Full Metal Jacket' is a film for you.",Null,0,0,28 January 2001
American Pie," Funny teenage flick but a little overdone
","'American Pie' was a good way to confront important teenage issues.  Some examples include sex, sex, and, uh, sex.  'American Pie' was a pretty funny movie.  It was great to see history in the making.  I'm not saying that this was a really important movie, but it put fuel on the ever-kindling fire of dirty teenage flicks.  Without 'American Pie' movies like 'Road Trip' and 'Scary Movie' wouldn't even have been considered for production.  'American Pie' didn't really pioneer dirty flicks, see the Farelly brothers for that, it did though provide a precedent for the already mentioned movies.  Although 'American Pie' was somewhat meaningful for pubis movie goers, it really was just an excuse for teens to see nudity.  Some teens aren't blessed with Cinemax and Showtime, God bless those forsaken souls, and have to appease their carnal requirements.  This film was just an excuse to provide a little bit of water, in the ever dry throat of teenage lust.  Some scenes and situations were less than raunchy though, and showed the importance of relationship as more than just physical but it showed that mutual likeness can be lovely.  Returning to the risque scene, some scenes weren't appropriate for most young teens even, and kids these days here and retell more dirty jokes than Rodney Dangerfield and Saturday Night Live writers combined.    So, if you're into raunchy teenage comedy, you'll like 'American Pie.'  If you're a young teenager who doesn't know what snowballing is (very obscure term, see 'Clerks', great movie, to find out you fledgling dirty terminologists) or if you're not sure what pea-braining is (I made that one up), don't see it.  Wait till you see movies like 'Dumb & Dumber' or 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High' (Just kidding, don't see that one!), and then allow yourself to relsih in the brilliance of vulgar teenage writers inspired by Southern Comfort and Bong Residue.  If you're a parent screening the movie for a sleepover or something like that, pretend that you never heard about this film.                Choose Wisely and Enjoy!",Null,1,2,22 January 2001
American Beauty," Everything you want in a movie
","'American Beauty' had everything you want in a movie.  It was dramatic, funny, sad, and brought you joy.  If something can give you all those feelings in a matter of about two hours, it truly is  meaningful.   'American Beauty' truly was meaningful.  It was a masterpiece in contemporary film-making.  It was such a great movie because everybody could relate to or have known at least one character types in the movie.  This reminds of 'Breakfast Club' because that movie was a character cross-section of just about every high-schooler in the country.  As meaningful as 'Breakfast Club' was to teens, 'American Beauty' was to families.  'American Beauty' is  the story of a man breaking free of everything that hinders him from true happiness: his wife, his job, his responsibility.  But this film was more than just the liberation of a man, it was the story of the darker side of suburban families.  The overbearing, dominant wife, the repressed father, the unhappy, confused teen.  Is there any other better description of a suburban family?  'American Beauty' tells the story of their lives, and the people they meet, and the development which takes place.  'American Beauty' was just full of unique, well casted characters who showed how they lived and how their actions affected others.  Besides a good plot and characters, 'American Beauty' was also wonderfully directed.  The film has it's own look, not bright or happy, or even repressed and depressing, but just it's own look.  If you watch the movie, you'll notice the crisp look of the images.  It is no wonder that Sam Mendes won the Academy Award for Best Director.    If you want to witness film-making history in the making, see this movie, and the influence it will surely have on potential films.  Take my word for it, you'll enjoy this movie.                 My rating: 10/10",10,0,0,23 January 2001
American History X," Great, little known, Oscar-worthy movie
","American History X is just a great film.  It is one of my favorite movies, not because of the plot, because believe me, I'm not a prejudiced biggot like some of the characters in it, but because it puts the horrors and stupidity of racism and of being a racist.  Every person (black, white, whatever) knows someone of another race that they don't like, maybe there's a bunch of people from that race that they don't like, and they tell themselves that they're not racist.  It's most likely true that you are not. This movie displays how evil people can be just because they may be a racist.    This movie reveals a great truth: that hate doesn't help, it only makes you feel worse abiut yourself and makes people hate you more.  This movie has a great cast as well as a good plot.  Edward Norton and edward Furlong play great brothers and the rest of the cast isn't too shabby either.  Rent this film and experience hate, and the poitlessness of it.",10,0,1,17 January 2001
The Usual Suspects," Superb crime movie
","The Usual Suspects is simply a great movie.  From it's unique and wonderful directing style to it's great cast of charcaters and actors, The Usual Suspects is just one good scene after another that compiles together to form a modern masterpiece in crime drama.    All of the actors were just spectacular in this picture.  Stephen Baldwin is just great.  He's funny and plays a great criminal.  Kevin Pollack, ome of the most underrated and talented actors of our time, is hilarious.  He plays the regular wise-cracking jerk criminal full of good jokes and fresh sarcasm.  Kevin Spacey is phenomenal.  He acts perfectly for the role he is supposed to.  Benicio Del Toro is great too.  He's funny and exciting in all of his roles, of course.  And of course there's Chazz Palmenteri.  He's great as the hard-ass detective trying desperately to solve the mystery the film centers around.    The non-linear order of scenes in this movie really works out well, and is never really confusing.  Non-linear timelines of scenes always add a little spice to the film.  This one works out perfectly.    And of course the plot is just awesome.  It's a great story for a crime/drama.  Twists and turns at every corner.  Surprises, fun elements added, etc.  The action in the movie is great too.  The gun fighting scenes are good too.  Last but definitely not least is the great ending.  Bryan Singer just pulls the carpet out from under you.  It's surprising and simply awesome. And the ending scenes are truly classic.  Truly.  This is just a great film that deserves to be seen by everybody.",9,0,1,24 May 2001
From Dusk Till Dawn," A grusome, fun look at Vampires and Crime
","Directed by the Producers of both 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Desperado,' everybody thought that 'Dusk Till Dawn' would probably be a masterpiece: the cream of the crop of the corroborations of two great film makers.  Boy, were those optimists wrong.  'From Dusk Till Dawn,' in my opinion, is the combination of 'Evil Dead: 2' and 'Pulp Fiction'.  It yields grusome action with a scary twist with a crime world twist with a funny twist.  If you like grusome, funny violence, then you'll like 'Dusk Till Dawn'.  This movie, despite all the bad publicity, is actually a pretty good movie if you don't mind blood, gore, nudity, and profanity.  If you're a teen-ager, you'll love it; if you're older, especially if you're a parent, you'll hate it.  Choose wisely, but either way, just enjoy the work of two directors who just wanted to have some fun.               My rating: (professional) 6/10, (sheer fun) 8/10",10,13,23,21 January 2001
2001: A Space Odyssey," A journey through truly classic filmmaking
","2001: a Space Odyssey is truly one of if not the greatest sci-fi movie ever made.  Kubrick was one of the greatest directors of all time.  Always making an intelligently made, meaningful movie that wasn't always appreciated by critics but usually adored by countless movie buffs.  This movie, Kubrick's first dip into the endless seas of science firction, has probably had more impact than any other movie in the sci-fi category.  It changed the image that many people had of science fiction up to that point. Kubrick brought an often ludicrous and usually meaningless genre into the blossoming and incredible gem that it is today.  Would cinema be the same without such classics as Blade Runner, Star Wars, or The Matrix?  The answer is no.  And all this beauty can be credited towards one man- Stanley Kubrick.The film is the story of mankind.  It is an wisely conceived theory about the origin of human intelligence.  It's full of countless themes having to do with the human nature, computers, religion, and alien control over our lives.  The most comprehensive work about the themes of 2001 can be found in the liner notes of the 2001: a Space Odyssey soundtrack.  It is full of cool insights about the great picture.2001 is an interesting movie but really is always either loved or hated, just one side or the other, no in betweens.  The main reason that the film is sometimes so strongly hated is because of the fact that nothing really exciting happens in the film.  There is no emotion or great acting in the film.  No gun fights or big action sequences.  The main reason to see this movie is to realize and understand the deep underlying themes in it.  I'm not going to divulge any of them, but the source I stated before pretty much covers it.  If you're not into movies that are real thinkers, then don't see this.  If you like sci-fi like Armageddon or (shudder) Supernova, then definitely don't se this.  This isn't the story of a budding romance and a bunch of cool zero gravity laser fights.2001: a Space Odyssey is truly a work of art.  It deserves to be seen by anyone with any interest in film or any so called sci-fi fan.",8,0,1,24 May 2001
The Mummy Returns," One of the worst movies ever made
","Not only is this one of the worst movies ever made, but in my opinion it was extremely funny.  It wasn't meant to be funny though.  At the meant to be funny parts I shuddered due to the cliched movie hogwash I was hearing. Some parts were just unbearable.  There were so many stupid mistakes that the directors made that were in the film.  I don't mean like seeing a shadow or a boom mike on accident, I mean things that just don't make any damn sense.  For Example:  When the team of adventurous, pulp comic, Indiana Jones rip-off team of heroes were traveling in a blimp made out of wood, they had a fire in the blimp.  I don't mean in a secluded little stone alcove made for bonfires, I mean right on the wooden floor of the blimp. This is what I saw!  And then, later, when the heroes were trying to escape impending doom from a previously KILLED AND SENT TO HELL mummy monster guy, they escaped on their blimp in a very fake manner.  They didn't deflate the balloon or anything that stupid, they used advanced rocket technology...with seemingly no harsh burns or accidents...in 1935...when rocket technology was unheard of...on an independent charterer's seemingly pieced together by junk blimp.  Just great. That made a whole lot of sense.  The scenes in this movie just didn't make sense.  When Brendan Frasier and that magi guy are stalking through a museum, they encounter many live mummies...trapped in glass...brought back from the dead.  That all seems okay.  But when this seemingly terrifying ordeal was over, they seem unfase, the don't even mention the incident...ever.  And what is the deal with Imhotep or whatever. He was dragged to Hell at the end of Mummy part one, right?  Well, now somehow they dug him up only to find him encased in some sort of bug carcass loookin thing.  HOW?  HOW?  HOW?  THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE!!!!  I couldn't control myself at many parts of the movie from making both snyde remarks and immense outbursts of rude laughter.  Oops!  The cliched gun fights with the average enough lookin Arabs were once again, completely stupid.  The same thing happened again and again.  A bunch of Egyptians clad in the average turbin and desert fatigue (IN LONDON!!!) with NO ACCURACY FIRING THE AUTOMATIC WEAPON were killed almost instantly any time the good guy pointed a gun at them.  Maybe I just have really good taste (considering one of my favorite movies is Evil Dead II) TRUST ME, DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE. IT WAS INCREDIBLY STUPID!",4,0,0,24 May 2001
Pulp Fiction," Great cast, plot, acting, and directing
","What can I say about this film that hasn't already been said.  I guess my favorite attribute about this movie is the unique direction by Quentin Tarentino.  Instaed of having an average crime drama with lots of cool killing like most movies, he intertwined three different stories and one cool scene into a superb look at crime.  Tarentino makes criminals look not as much like one-dimensional Gods, as most movies do, but he makes them look like average human beings that have morals, weaknesses, and personalities. He shows how crimianls make mistakes, and that their reasons for killing aren't just for the hell of it.  He shows how criminals think, feel, react, etc.  Besides that, the cast is just exceptional.  Harvey Keitel, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, etc. all make the movie experience more fun.  They all are wonderful stage presences, to say the least.  Another cool thing about the film that is often overlooked is it's image.  It has this image that is just impossible to describe, like how American Beauty or Fight Club moth have their images.  The colors, the sets, the dialouge, the characters all come together to create this image, and, let me tell you: it's just awesome.  It's a fun movie with witty dialouge. I can't get enough of this movie.  And, oh yeah, the infamous basement scene with the...I won't give it away.  It's very awful and disgusting but it's not like the entire movie is centered around it, so just watch it, and see how it plays a vital part in the development of Bruce Willis's charcater. See it, you'll love it (But first see Resovoir Dogs.'",Null,0,1,19 May 2001
Army of Darkness," 'Maybe I didn't say every single little syllable..' but this movie rules!
","This film is the third and (hopefully not) final in the series of Evil Dead, Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn, and, of course, Army of Darkness.  Some people say this movie is scary, but it is absolutely not.  It's a good action flick with hilarious scenes.  If you like movies that are one part action and one part comedy, then you'll like this.  The funniest parts of the movie are when Ash gets beaten up or made to look like an ass.  This movie focuses more on all this c**p that happens to Ash, a clerk at a typical Wal-Mart like store while he has no idea what the hell is going on.  It's one of those movies where the main character you feel sorry for, but not for long because it's so hilarious (like in 'The Big Lebowski,' one of my other reviews).  This is a good movie for, if you're a kid, to bring to a sleepover because there are absolutely no boring scenes, it's all just good action and comedy.  If you saw Evil Dead one or two, then this is a good conclusion to the two somewhat darker films.  Well, all I could say is that this a good movie: rent and enjoy it.

The Shawshank Redemption," The perfect movie
","The Shawshank Redemption is a movie is film-making at it's best.  It features superb acting, directing, and story.  Every single shot in this movie was a good one, the camera worked wonders that the average eye disregards as they focus on the beauty of the film.  This is the story of a falsely convicted man, and his struggle for freedom.  Beyond the already great fact that it was a prison movie set in the 40's through late 60's, it was written by Stephen King, one of the greatest fictional writers of the late 20th centruy.  The best part about prison movies is the fact that it's always moving, always developing, never boring.  There's just something about prison movies that make you feel at home, as odd as that sounds.  And plus, the movie was full of great narration and dialouge, full prison similes that were so eloquent, you know only Stephen King could have written them.  Shawshank is the kind of movie you could watch over and over again and never get sick of, like American Beauty or One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.     The movie just simply is perfect by every standard that we set.  Do yourself a favor and see this movie.",10,0,0,2 February 2001
Raging Bull," A modern classic, full of great detail and cinematography
","Raging Bull truly was a great movie.  It is probably the best boxing movie of all time as well as DeNiro's probably best work (maybe Taxi Driver or Godfather II).  What I liked the most about this movie was the cinematography.  Scorcese in my opinion has just about the best cinematography of any director, excluding maybe Stanley Kubrick.  The superb filming is highlighted in the marvelous boxing scenes.  The screen can get blurry at times(intentional) and the camera moves quickly around the ring and whips around each fighter as they jab and punch.  The glorious black and white and eventual color also work out very well.  In the early and middle parts of the film, the movie is in black and white.  The setting and characters all look like they came directly from the forties, where these portions are based.  Even if you're not a boxing fan, you'll still be amazed.  If average fights were filmed the way the fights in the movie were, God knows I'd be watching more often.  And another thing: the pacing was brilliant.  How the very slow and agreeable scenes melded quickly with the fast paced boxing scenes.
  Overall, it's a great film with great directing, filming, acting, and everything.  It should be seen by all Scorcese or Boxing fans and all film-buffs.",Null,1,1,11 June 2001
The Silence of the Lambs," 'I ate his liver with Fava beans and a nice Chianti...'
","Dr. Hannibal Lecter: incredibly brilliant, amazingly deceptive and manipulative, and unspeakably evil.  'The Silence of the Lambs' delves into the depths of the mind of Hannibal Lecter. In 1991, when 'The Silence of the Lambs' was released, audiences were shocked when the previously mild-mannered Anthony Hopkins delivered the amazing performance as Hannibal Lecter.  It was the the third movie in history to recieve all five major Academy Awards, Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Best Screenplay.  The Academy was right in giving the awards to this fantastic movie. Clarice Starling is taken away from her normal training as an F.B.I. agent and is dispatched to speak with Lecter, a formerly well known psychologist and now imprisoned murderer.  Her mission in this is to get a mental profile of Buffalo Bill, the current serial killer who the F.B.I. are desperately hunting down.  Maybe, if they had a mental profile from an actual serial killer, and cannibal, they could get inside the mind of Buffalo Bill and catch him.  Hannibal then more or less informs Clarice that Bill was once a patient of his.  As Clarice again interviews Lecter, the story unfolds. This film is more than just the pursuit to catch a serial killer, more than the actions of a serial killer, it is a journey into the mind of an enigma, Dr. Hannibal Lecter.",9,0,0,16 January 2001
The Matrix," Beautiful film
","'The Matrix' is one of the best Science Fiction movies of all time.  It yields a great plot, characters, and action, as well as a theory about human existence and life as we know it and implies a warning about the control of Artificial Intelligence.  This movie was released at the perfect time.  When it was released in 1999, the world still was frightened of the Y2K problem, which might have become a problem related to the problem in 'The Matrix.' Also, Artificial Intelligence was (and still is) just arond the corner, frightening audiences world wide.  The third reason that it's release was impeccably timed was that special effects allowed 'The Matrix' to become more than a Sci-Fi/Drama, it became a Big Action/Sci-Fi film with a dramatic story.   The way this movie was filmed and directed really made the entire film worth-while to see.  The special effects, though made in 1998-99, are still cutting edge.  The camera angles actually show a bullets path as well as a way to rotate around a great fight scene in slow motion.  The camera angles were just fabulous and turned 'The Matrix' into an even better directed film than it already was.  Another cool directorial attribute that made the film even better than it would have been was that most of the color blue, only in the Matrix not reality, was taken out to make the setting look dismal and show that the Matrix really was a repressive and depressing place.  Many questions are raised after seeing this movie.  Although I can't reveal them now, I can tell you that this movie is worth seeing for maybe only this reason if you're not big on movies but you are big on philosophy.

The Breakfast Club," Featuring a star-filled cast, excellent plot and dialogue, this is one of the greatest eighties movies.
","'The Breakfast Club' will forever be remembered as one of the greatest films for many reasons.  This seemingly simple plot thickens as the story unfolds. 'The Breakfast Club' displays many popular features that most 80's teen movies possess.  For example, all of the young main characters are full of an attribute that seemed so often confronted in 80's movies that it defined many characters in movies from that decade.  Angst.  That simple word describes a feeling that every main character experienced for reasons not too diverse.  Angst is felt in this film's characters and is directed primarily towards teachers, school, and, of course, parents.  As each character explained their troubles to each other they realized how similar they were.  With a star-studded cast including Molly Ringwald, Anthony Michael hall, Emilio Esteves, and, of course, Judd Nelson, this movie is easily summarized as magnificent.  Judd Nelson is featured in his most famous role as a bully, criminal, and typical high-school punk which every adult, young or old, can easily relate to.  With his seemingly simple personality he is used as the comic-relief as well as the individual who triggers character conversations.  These hilarious and somewhat immature conversations are really the glue which holds together this fabulous movie. The deep explanation of these multifaceted characters is exceptional.  The audience could easily relate to the troubles and pain that each character experienced. The main individuals featured in this picture each developed to understand each other and to think differently of themselves.  To truly experience the 80's, see this film and be amazed.",10,0,1,4 June 2000
Goodfellas," Classic Mafia Cinema
","Good fellas was directed by master director Martin Scorcese and is probabaly his best.  It tells the story of an Irish-Italian protaginist, Henry Hill, who starts out running errands for his friendly mafia neighbours to becoming a made man.  It brings us through the traditional and exciting avenues of an Italian crime syndicate from the the fifties to the eighties. The cast is also exceptional.  Ray Liotta plays the main character and his close friend and mentor is played by Robert DeNiro, the definitive actor to play a gangster.  The rest of the cast is filled with actors who play mafiosos in many other crime movies.  The movie is really a story told in the first person by the main character, Henry Hill, of the perks of being involved in the mafia and the sudden betrayl and the self-centeredness that the mob can entail.    It's truly a great picture that should be seen by everybody whoo has any interest in crime or crime dramas.  Superb!",10,0,0,7 June 2001
Evil Dead II," A funny, violent cult masterpiece
","Evil Dead was a somewhat funny, scary, and cheaply made movie that definitely brought back a hefty profit.  Evil Dead two was even better. Perhaps the greatest of the three Sam Raimi zombie films, it is definitely the funniest and was a little bit less of a sell-out movie, so to speak. I'm going to turn to Kevin Smith for a prime example in the thinking of saying that Army of Darkness, although an awesome movie, was still reeking of selling out while Evil Dead two was pure genius (well...): Clerks, the first movie in the Jersey trilogy featuring the charcaters Silent Bob and Jay and all written and directed by Kevin Smith.  Clerks was a materpiece in independent film making.  It was deeply insightful, hiarious, and overall entertaining.  It was made in a distinct style that quickly famed Kevin Smith.  Mallrats: the next movie in the Jersey trilogy, was a little bit more of, as said before, a sell-out movie.  It was made entirely not to provide deep theme or insight, but to make money.  That is what Army of Darkness is to Evil Dead two.  Evil Dead two is a pure, funny, gorey movie that shouldn't be missed if you're into 'scary' movies that just end up being funny.",8,0,0,21 May 2001
