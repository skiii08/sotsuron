Alien 3," Pretty good
","I have read many of the negative reviews here on IMDb and in nearly every single one, the author cited their major gripe as the characters of Hicks and Newt being killed off before the start of the movie. WHY is this a problem?? They do not have to be in this movie for it to be good. This movie is different in style from the second movie and the main point is the idea of isolating Ripley while creating an atmosphere of fear, isolation, claustrophobia loneliness and desperation. This would be impossible if Ripley had her buddies from the previous movie with her to back her up! Hicks and Newt were basically the daughter and husband Ripley wished she had so having them dead adds this tremendous feeling of loss (and desperation) which I felt Sigorny Weaver did a great job of expressing.Basically, this is a dark and brooding film with lots of suspense and a great plot twist in the end which also happens to be a great way to end the series as a whole. The soundtrack was decent and the visuals were grim and gritty (as one would expect from a movie in this series). Weaver does a good job acting the character of Ripley and the other characters do a good job being alien-fodder and also helping her in her attempt to kill the alien. The direction is stylistic but in a way that serves to deepen the thematic sense of isolation and desperation.In short, I recommend this film to anyone who likes scifi-suspense or is a fan of the series!",8,4,5,27 September 2009
It," A stupid waste of time and money
","The updated effects helped to keep me awake through the movie, but they weren't enough to make it scary, because the effects were only used for jump scares. The only part that was remotely scary was the scenes with the crazy mom of one of the kids and the scenes with another kid's creepy dad.The clown demon wasn't that scary. The closest it came to being scary was the scene from the trailer where it pops out of the projector screen ala Ringu. It was slightly scary because it made it clear that the demon knew who the kids were, where they were, and what they were doing.I strongly advise against seeing this movie because nearly everything in it is sooooooooo stupid! The town has been plagued by a murdering demon and also huge catasrophes that nearly wipe out the town and are probably also caused by the demon for hundreds of years and yet there is still a town. No one left??The town doesn't seem to care that there are gangs of psychotic kids roving around constantly butchering other people! There are rapes happening in the street in broad daylight and there is no reaction from anyone and somehow there is still a town. Just over the course of the movie, tons of people are killed or at least go missing and there is no reaction from the town other than a couple of missing posters. The police never become involved and there's no FBI presence!There are also no consequences for the main kids either. The kids execute a fellow kid and leave his body in the sewer and the girl bludgeoned her dad to death and yet it is never even mentioned again and she just goes to live with her aunt. WTF?Even after the demon is defeated and the kids rescue the people who had been taken, they only try to revive the main girl and they don't tell anyone in the town about it so presumably there's no investigation and the hundreds of bodies are just left in the sewer to rot... Just to give you an idea of how horribly pathetic this movie is, the boys 'wake' the girl by giving her a steamy kiss...The movie is also inconsistent with it's portrayal of the demon! On several occasions, the movie unequivocally states that it lives off people's fear, but then why does it kill and eat people? Also if it just needs fear, then wouldn't killing it's victims be counter productive? On the other hand, if it needs physical sustenance, then what's the point of the whole fear thing? Why wouldn't it just snatch prey and eat it like a beast? Also why does it look like a clown and why do it's victims float? This is treated like a huge issue as it is referenced throughout the film and yet neither point is ever explained!Rather the kids say that it seems to show each person the thing that that person fears the most and yet despite that exposition it still appears as a clown to each of the kids!",2,55,105,12 September 2017
The Death of Stalin," Entertaining for fans of watching idiots bumble about
","This movie is a somewhat funny, but mostly it is a serious look at an absurd series of events following Joseph Stalin's death in 1953. Various parties within the Soviet Government quickly plot to set themselves up as the new leader and to remove their rivals. Unfortunately for the audience, this is no white knuckle political thriller, because the players in this game are the most insane, over-the-top, and incompetent bunch of neurotic imbeciles that I have seen on screen since the show Arrested Development. The movie is not exciting, but it is entertaining to watch the ridiculous characters fumble their way through ever more dire circumstances of their own creation.",8,1,2,8 April 2018
Darkest Hour," Utterly pointless
","This movie provides no information about Winston Churchill that isn't already in the high school curriculum and it provides no new insight into the man given what the public generally knows about him.The film suggests a lot of topics, but doesn't seem to take a stance on any of them. It doesn't even give a comprehensive account of either Winston Churchill or what England was like during World War 2. Rather, the film focuses on Churchill sitting in a few meetings and then giving a couple of speeches over the course of about a month leading up to England's official entry into the second world war. This is a terribly boring subject and I can't picture ANYONE having wanted to see a LONG, LONG, LONG movie about this very insignificant part of history.Worse yet is that the movie had so very, many moments of promise, but failed to make good on any of them. For example, Churchill's wife said something which suggested that the rest of the family hated Winston because he had sacrificed his family for his career. The movie could have explored this and other issues that he had with his family, but it doesn't. Why bring it up at all if the matter will never be mentioned again? The movie sets up the comparison between Churchill, Hitler, and Trump, but never discusses the matter. Churchill's massive political and military failures were hinted at, but never discussed. Possibly even more irritating is the fact that the film never mentions how Churchill rose to power on a single-minded policy of military action despite the public and the British Government knowing of his MASSIVE bungling of several military campaigns in the past.Moreover, the movie fails to mention various critical and/or interesting things about Winston Churchill such as how he had a strange and extremely deep connection with a Mr. Lindemann whose counsel he sought daily and whose words he heeded without question. The movie also portrays Churchill as a man of the people when, in fact, he hated nearly everyone and especially the common people and non-Caucasians. He was a massive bigot whose bigotry and blind faith in his friend's advice led to the death of tens of millions of British subjects and yet none of it is mentioned in a biopic about him!Lastly, the film doesn't even bother to explain the few things that it does bring up. For example, it is never explained why the two main parties in Parliament chose him. It is not explained why the plot to remove him never happens. It is not explained why the king suddenly changes from actively despising and distrusting Churchill to blindly supporting him. It is not explained why Parliament is bored by Churchill's first speech but goes frat party crazy throwing paper everywhere and shouting approval after Churchill's second speech despite it being almost the same as his first speech!",1,80,158,28 December 2017
Batman Returns," alright as a movie, pathetic as a batman movie
","First of all, Michael Keaton is NOT the person to pick to play Batman. Bruce Wayne is supposed to be the young, slick, playboy millionaire. Keaton is middle aged, ugly, balding, short, stocky and NOT slick or suave. Batman is supposed to be badass and menacing. He is a vigilante not the town mascot! He is disturbed and almost as much a problem for the cops as he is for the robbers. Most of all he is supposed to strike fear into his enemies. Keaton simply does not pull this off. He is short, stocky and looks like a kid trying on his dad's clothes when he puts on the suit. Combine that with his rigid movement and pathetic attempt at fighting and he can only succeed at making the criminals laugh.Add to that the pathetic villains -we have the penguin and catwoman, neither of who seem very menacing at all and really pose little threat to Batman. Also, WTH is with the thousands of little penguins with rocketpacks?? I might like this movie if I was a pothead but otherwise the march of the penguins is just too cute for such a dark movie.Burton's trademark dark visuals are really the only good thing about the movie. I always liked his representation of Gotham but this can't save a movie doomed from the get-go by bad casting/choice of villains.",4,29,46,9 September 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," 1 part musical + 1 part 'normal' film = garbage
",This film is ruined by the fact it is a musical. The actors CAN'T SING! Their horrible attempts at singing make me want to gouge out my eardrums. Most everything else about the film is great. The actors do a good/great job playing their parts. The story is very fairytale-ish but it works well enough to keep the viewer's attention until the very entertaining climax. Sacha Baren Cohen is annoying but thankfully doesn't last long. The imagery is dark and foreboding and the special affects really enhance the gruesomeness of the violent scenes and the hilarity of the comedic/dream scenes. If only there were no pathetic lyrics and no bad singing.Tim Burton clearly does not know how to direct a musical. He directs it like he does any of his other films which is not appropriate for a musical. It is awkward to have characters walking around like normal just to spontaneously break out into song. It feels like he took a normal film and spliced/dubbed in musical numbers. Successful musicals do not present things directly like normal films. They hint at stuff allegorically. In this way the singing/dancing is removed from reality and the viewer understands that it is there to emphasize a certain aspect of the plot. Two good examples of this are 'Chicago' and 'All that Jazz' where the song & dance numbers are presented as sort of dreams or delusions but still serve to explain certain feelings/motivations of the characters.,2,1,4,8 September 2008
Quantum of Solace," Amazingly good
","I was introduced to the Bond series through the films featuring Pierce Brosnan, which while they had their silly moments, were much more serious than the Bond movies before them. Maybe this has biased me or maybe I would always feel this way, but I really like the serious approach that the new Bond films (now starring Daniel Craig) take.I shied away from seeing this new film for quite a while after hearing horrible things about the story, pacing, editing etcetera but I have to say that I found it incredibly entertaining.There was a lot of action but the short bits of talk and whatnot in between were well used for maximum effect which I felt helped greatly to build the emotional tension and show how Bond's character is growing-up (albeit slowly). The action scenes also felt a little more frenetic than in Casino Royale but they were by no means unwatchable as some have suggested. In fact I liked every scene until the one with the explosions in the desert. It was cool and entertaining though I relived being scared as a child during the Backdraft attraction at Universal Studios! The only detractors I can think of is 1) that the explosion scene was a little overboard. At some point the characters should have just given up and rushed out of the building rather than stubbornly duke it out 'til the building was falling down around them!! 2) The villain(s) were really bland but then I guess that goes with the realism of the story.",9,8,16,9 February 2009
Children of Men," Major issues overrun strong points.
",This movie has the most realistic portrayal of war and fighting in general that I have ever seen. Also the chemistry between the two main characters is great as both actors do an amazing job.These two good things are not enough to carry the movie and it ends up becoming a confusing waste of time. If this were a war movie then I could understand the careful attention paid to the fighting but it is not a war movie. It is also not a discussion of modern terrorism so all the explosions and ferocity are seriously out of place.The movie asks 'what if humanity were to suddenly become infertile?' The problem is that this question is never answered and the situations surrounding the characters are never explained. Why is everyone infertile? What is going on? Why is everything taking place in England? Why is there so much upheaval? Who are all these groups of people and what do they want? This movie would be much better as a video game. Games can be stretched out and as the person is entertained by controlling their character information about the world of the game can be slowly hinted at in a peripheral sort of way. This method can create atmosphere and tension when done properly but is not suitable for a 90min movie that raises so many questions and answers none of them.,3,6,10,30 June 2008
Black Panther," Wasted potential with stupid plot and full of tribal cliches
","Good things first:
The actors are beautiful and talented. The cast give fantastic performances with the exception of the guy who plays the main baddy who does a so-so job.The CGI is obnoxiously overused, but it looks pretty cool. Similarly the design of the aircraft and the underground part of the city looked super cool.The bad:
Very little in this movie makes sense. The plot is stupid and so many important details were overlooked. For example, why do the super-advanced people fight exclusively with melee weapons? Also, why do they have super advanced weapons and fighter/bomber planes and why do the average citizenry seem to know military tactics (they form a phalanx during the final fight) if they've never been in a single war ever and have only ever hidden from the world???? Why does Black Panther simply have a special suit and magic metal claws? This is supposed to be part of the Marvel universe so Ironman and the Hulk exist in this. What could this guy contribute? He could contribute super advanced and nearly indestructible weaponry (guns/drones/satellites) based on the magic metal. Instead, he's just a tribal cliche in a catsuit... meow.Moreover, there were some REALLY good concepts that were brought up, but never fully examined. For example there were ideas of family, heritage, identity, geopolitics, race and more that were never really examined. Even the main baddy's motivation could have made for a really great story with a REALLY dark twist at the end, but, instead we got the Disney rated G ending which didn't even make any sense.",3,2,4,1 April 2018
