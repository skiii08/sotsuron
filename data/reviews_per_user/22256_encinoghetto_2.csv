The Blair Witch Project," This movie stinks!
","I paid a dollar for this movie. My friend got me in on a group discount. People around the theater were complaining about how bad the movie was while it played. I wanted my dollar back! PEW!!!!!What a bad film. OK. I know it was low budget, but this movie was all hype. No good at all!",1,14,26,18 July 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," AWESOME!!!
",What an awesome film! Perfectly cast. The cinematography is brilliant!It was written so well that even someone who is completely unfamiliar with the books will be able to follow the story and understand it. Great acting as well. The next installment in the trilogy is going to be even BIGGER. I can't wait!,10,1,1,11 August 2002
