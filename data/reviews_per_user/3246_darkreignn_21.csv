Blade Runner 2049," Honestly, over-hyped and mediocre at best
","There's a lot to like about this movie. Ryan Gosling gives a fantastic performance, both nuanced and surprisingly emotional. The action, when there is action, is well filmed and brutal and fun to watch. The CGI is pretty much flawless, and I'm not joking when I say that while watching this movie, you'll think you're watching a real world. The film is interesting, it's well shot, well directed, it's visually stunning, it's pretty, and the score is very thrilling. But as a whole, this movie is just so god da*n boring. Look, I like slow paced movies, but this film is beyond slow paced. It's brain dead. It's literally like watching a person with no arms and legs try to crawl across a football field. I won't lie, at first I liked this slow pace because it built up a lot of tension, a lot of mystery, a lot of suspense, and I assumed that eventually the film would kick into high gear; it never did. The pace remains constant throughout the entire run time of this movie. It's excruciatingly slow. The movie is almost 3 hours long, and it feels like 6. I couldn't wait for this movie to end, I mean by the end of the movie I expected to look in the mirror and see that I aged 65 years. And also, the film is also overly convoluted. I'm not saying that this is a confusing film, because it's not; in fact, it's pretty straightforward and easy to follow. It just simply felt like this movie was convoluted for the sake of it being convoluted. At the time of watching everything felt important. I had to pee so badly the entire movie but I didn't want to get up because I felt like everything I was watching was super important. However, only after viewing do I realize that there were so many scenes that were totally unnecessary, that were there only to make the movie longer, more bloated, and more self-important.Unfortunately, there's just not much else to say. This is a simple movie, and it gets a simple review. Look, I wanted to give this a high score, but I just couldn't, and I don't understand why other people are because this movie is simply not enjoyable or entertaining. Yes, it's well made, a feast for the eyes and ears, but that doesn't make it a good film; it makes it a well directed and produced film, but not a good one.",4,133,258,8 October 2017
First Man," A fantastic, emotional character study
","'First Man' is, without a doubt, one of my favorite movies of the year. From the opening scene I was instantly riveted, and Ryan Gosling's nuanced, subtle, emotional performance had me glued to my seat for the entire over two hour runtime.Once again, Chazelle proves that he is a master behind the camera. The entire film has a very handheld, documentary look, complete with film grain to add to the retro realism the movie wants to give off. I've read online that some people found the constant use of close-ups and shaky camera distracting, but I found that it enhanced to the grittiness and aesthetic of the film; it truly felt like I was watching a documentary at parts, and since this movie was fundamentally a character study of Neil Armstrong, I thought that the stylistic directing approach worked. That being said, I can totally understand where the criticisms are coming from; there are some scenes where the camera is shaking so violently that I wouldn't be surprised if the cameraman was going through cardiac arrest during filming. But, these overly spastic and violent shakes usually only occured during the 'rocket' scenes, for lack of a better word, and it added tenfold to the intensity and claustrophobia that a real astronaut would feel - they can't get out of the rocket, and so, neither can we.This film has also gained controversy for the very un-Hollywood portrayal of the entire Apollo mission. Now, what do I mean by that? 'First Man,' as I mentioned previously, is in no way, shape, or form a 'feel-good' movie. In fact, it's downright depressing. Instead of portraying this mission as something that was incredible for America and exciting for Neil Armstrong, the film shows the mission through the lens of Neil's emotional state, which happens to be depressed, if not borderline suicidal.You see, the film opens with a tragedy that happens to Neil. One of our first looks at this man is him holding his head, crying. It's rough stuff, and it's tough not to cry with him. And throughout the film, whenever Neil goes, tragedy seems to follow. So it's no surprise that Ryan Gosling plays him in such a stoic, quiet, sad way. I've read reviews that demonized this performance for being too stoic, but my response to that is this: would you expect a man who has had tragedy after tragedy happen to him, to be happy? Neil is not happy, and Ryan Gosling's performance makes that evident. Neil buries himself in his work, trying to distract himself from the pain, even knowing that death is a very real possibility should things go wrong. It's a very down-to-earth take on this American hero, and it's very interesting.That being said, this movie is incredibly long. Luckily, about every half-hour or so there are exceedingly exciting scenes of rocket lift-offs or astronaut training, but that doesn't necessarily keep the movie from being very slow. Look, no matter what, there is no denying this movie is slow, but I never found it to be boring, thanks to the amazing performances and beautifully euphoric musical score. Seriously, the music in this movie is just gorgeous, and coupled with the directing, it is really a sight to behold.'First Man' is a fantastic film. Strong, emotional performances, gorgeous music, beautiful directing, and one of the most inspiring stories known to mankind, just portrayed in a way that we've never seen before. This is a very quiet, contemplative, reflective film, more of an experience than anything else.10/10",10,1,3,15 October 2018
The Expendables 2," What the first one should have been.
","As soon as the movie starts it throws you into one of the most exciting action scenes I've ever seen. Guns go off, knives are thrown, and heads explode. The opening scene is better than the whole entire last movie.If you have seen the first one and liked it, you will LOVE this one. There is more action, more humor, and more fun. And the story is a little better this time around but lets face it, who goes for the story? We want to see Sly, Statham, and Norris kick butt. And boy do we get it.'The Expendables 2' is the best action movie I have seen all year. It's fun, exciting, and just better than the first movie in every way. Even Arnold and Bruce get their time to shine. If you are looking for a good time at the movies, watch this. If you want to take a girl on a date, take her to this. Is it your anniversary? Go see this. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes action movies. And even if you don't you will probably still have fun with this movie. Go see it... You won't regret it.",10,2,7,25 August 2012
War Dogs," The best movie of the summer
","Just before I start this review, I would like to thank the person who messaged me and said that they enjoy my reviews. I would reply to you personally, but for some reason my account will not verify. If you are reading this, I thank you because your message really meant a lot to me!'War Dogs' stars Jonah Hill and Miles Teller, and is an absolute blast and no doubt the best movie of the summer. First off, Jonah Hill's performance is so energetic, hilarious, and fun to watch. I don't want to spoil anything about his character, but let's just say he's very unpredictable, and very funny. He has some lines in this movie that will make you bust a gut laughing, and he's also surprisingly cool. He has a great scene involving drug dealers that I won't spoil, but it's one of the most entertaining scenes of the film. Miles Teller plays more of the serious man in this role, and he is just as good. He gives a compelling, sympathetic, and believable performance, and the relationship between him and his girlfriend, Ana de Armas, (who is probably the most beautiful person on the planet) is sweet to watch, and I enjoyed the romance and drama between them.The chemistry between Miles and Jonah felt real; they felt like childhood friends, and you could tell they had fun playing off of each other. Jonah felt like the person everyone wanted to be, while Miles felt like the person everyone became. In other words, Jonah was the fantasy and Miles was the reality, if that makes any sense. However you want to word it, the dichotomy between them worked well and they were both supremely entertaining.Also, Bradley Cooper has a small role in this movie, and he delivers what is probably the coolest line of the entire movie. He was so good, and I wish he played a more prominent role in the film, but what we got of him was great.While this movie is marketed as a comedy, it is more of a very fun and interesting drama with some really funny moments. 'War Dogs' is pretty much non-stop fun from start to finish, and is, in my opinion, the best film that Todd Phillips has made so far.",9,3,8,23 August 2016
Hereditary," I've never been so stressed out while watching a movie before
","I didn't grow up in a dysfunctional household, but after watching this movie it felt like I did; I wanted to call my therapist after this movie, and I don't even have a therapist. This movie was incredible. Part family drama about grief and loss, part supernatural horror film, 'Hereditary' is a movie that I am most likely never going to forget, and after watching it you won't either. There are images shown in this movie that I've gotten nightmares about. The thematic elements are more disturbing than I thought I would ever see in a movie released in this day and age. The people sitting next to me in the movie must've thought that I was having a mini seizure because there were so many points where I was grabbing my head, clutching my chest, jumping in my seat, and going 'oh God no.' This movie isn't necessarily scary, but it had me so stressed out that there were many points where I thought about leaving the theatre to just calm down for a second. When the movie ended, the biggest sense of relief washed over me, not because the movie was over per se, but simply because I could finally relax. I won't give any explicit spoilers for this film, so don't worry. What I will say is that this movie is gorgeous. The direction, the cinematography, the lighting, every frame, every shot, everything is delicious to look at. The acting is also immaculate. Everyone in this movie acts to perfection and if Toni Collette doesn't get nominated for an Oscar then she will have been robbed. The top-notch acting and direction enhances this movie so much. While some people may be bored by the slow-burn feel of this movie, I was constantly riveted because of the acting and gorgeous visuals. That being said, this movie is divisive.My audience hated this film. The didn't take this movie seriously, and laughed at literally everything. One older woman said 'That was stupid!' as soon as the movie ended and I felt personally offended, so offended that I said 'You're stupid!' and then ran out of the theatre like a child. But you know what? I can see where they were coming from. You see, the ending of this movie, specifically the last 20 or so minutes, will be incredibly polarizing. But for me, I was already so invested by that point that the climax of the movie didn't bother me a bit.So what I'm trying to say is, give this movie a shot. You may love it, you may think it's one of the stupidest movies you'll ever see. But the story, the direction, and the acting are all so immersive that for me, this was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.9/10",9,36,76,10 June 2018
A Star Is Born," At this point I'm jealous of Bradley Cooper
","As a self-proclaimed critic with years of experience writing movie reviews on the very prestigious website known as IMDB, I make it my personal mission to be the voice of the people. What I mean by that is, I don't like my reviews to be pretentious or filled with unnecessary commentary. When I watch a movie, I put myself into the shoes of an average moviegoer and I ask myself, 'If I wasn't a critic, would I enjoy this?' And as I was watching 'A Star Is Born,' I began to realize that if I was an average moviegoer, I would really love this film. The acting is practically perfect from Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, who portrays a drug addicted alcoholic to perfection. The directing is immaculate, filled with gorgeous, beautiful, personal, intimate moments that allow the romance to practically burst from the screen. And the soundtrack was one of the best I've ever heard in a film; Bradley Cooper not only can act, not only looks like an angel from Heaven, but the man can sing like nobody's business. However, even though I can recognize all of these things, on a personal level, I haven't left a film feeling so empty since I saw 'Split,' and if you've read my review for 'Split' then you'll remember me saying how I didn't want to, nor enjoy, the feeling of being emotionally gutted after the film; similarly, I didn't enjoy that feeling after this movie, either.I can recognize that this movie is good. The story is compelling, the music is lovely, the acting is top-notch, and the directing by Bradley Cooper is immaculate. There were so many moments that also sent chills through me because of how beautiful they were, in particular the first scene where Lady Gaga's character joins Bradley Cooper on stage to sing. There is a lot to love about this movie, and it's a movie not just about music and romance, but about heartache and depression, grief and loss. The movie deals with very real subjects that all of us have experienced in one way or the other. I know life isn't necessarily pretty, I recognize that life, for a lot of people, contains hardships and suffering. And I know that diseases like alcoholism and drug addiction are not glamorous. But seeing these things in this film portrayed in such an unflinching, realistic way, honestly, just bummed me out.I went to see this movie with my mom and my grandmother because who else would I go see a movie with, and I was very excited. In fact, my mother started to get annoyed because I felt the need to constantly remind her how excited I was to watch this movie. After the movie I didn't say a word. I felt like Bradley Cooper himself had personally reached into my soul and took out all the love and light. I felt genuinely empty. And I didn't enjoy that. So, on one hand, I recognize that this movie is good, legitimately it is one of the finer movies released this year, and if you go see it you will most definitely enjoy it. However, even though I recognize that this movie is good, I cannot personally say that I enjoyed it because of the way it made me feel. For better or for worse, I felt more depressed coming out of this movie then I did going in. Regardless, I am giving this film an 8 out of 10 because I legitimately think it is a great movie, just one that will tug at your heartstrings along the way.8/10",8,3,6,12 October 2018
Deadpool 2," Cashmeousside cuz this film is amazing
","Have you ever done cocaine? Me neither, but I can imagine the effects that cocaine have on a person is similar to the same psychological and bodily reaction one gets while watching 'Deadpool 2.' Imagine buying a nice bag of 100%, pure, unadulterated, Colombian 'sugar,' and you can already feel the rush through your body as you're walking home with it. Your hands are shaking with excitement, your heart is racing, and your brain is flooded with dopamine. Then you get home, ready to press your face against that sweet, sweet angel dust and breath in, and then the real rush hits you. Adrenaline, endorphins, it's like an orgasm times one million. You laugh, you cry, you feel your brain coursing with pleasure. The process of going to watch 'Deadpool 2' is like that, but better. First you buy the ticket, and you can feel a slight tingling in your groin area. Then you buy your popcorn, get a large soda because it's only 75 cents more than the medium and who could resist a deal like that, and as your wallet gets lighter because you just spent a week's pay in 15 minutes, the tingling increases, and you feel a slight sense of moisture (I'm trying to make this applicable to both sexes okay? This is 2018). Then you actually step inside of the theatre and you're basically a lake. Everyone around you is avoiding you because EVERY part of your body is dripping some form of liquid, and you're breathing heavily even though you didn't even snort any coke, at least, not the good kind. And then the trailers start and your excitement is almost unbearable. If you were having a sexual experience, which is practically what 'Deadpool 2' is, you would have no doubt already finished and disappointed your lover. But then, finally, sweet release rushes over you as the movie finally starts, and it's as if you've taken a page from Paul Finch's book and studied the art of sexual tantric meditation because for the duration of the entire run time you feel pure, radiating sexual pleasure. I'm not even exaggerating, but I am narcissistically stroking my own ego by overindulging in my own mediocre writing abilities, but that's how you get the A's kids, you write a bunch of fluff and make it sound professional, and now I'm making slightly above minimum wage in an insurance office doing work I did not go to college for so it looks like all my hard work paid off. Did I mention I made $160 in the stock market by selling a stock I owned when it rose a few bucks, but I could've made much more if I had any patience and waited only 3 hours later, at which point my stock would've rose to a number so astronomically large that I am currently considering checking myself into a psych ward because of how much I regret my decision? Don't worry though, because 'Deadpool 2' is funnier and more entertaining than my poorly written review. I laughed so hard that I have no doubt I made my girlfriend uncomfortable. My girlfriend, she didn't laugh that much, she chuckled, shook her head, farted a few times, but me, I couldn't stop. I was stroking my girlfriend's thigh slowly and suggestively during this movie because she's thicc and was wearing short shorts, but the stroking turned into iron-tight grips because I needed something to hold on to because I was laughing so hard. Seriously, my girlfriend now has bruises on her thighs and officer, I swear, it's Deadpool's fault. I really feel stupid because of how hard this movie made me laugh.And if you're a killjoy and don't find anything funny, then you shouldn't go see this movie but if you do, at the least the action will definitely entertain you. The action is slick and clean and gory and bloody and very high-energy, and really reminded me of 'Kick-Ass.' And when it comes to energy and humor and high-octane, stylized, awesome action, 'Deadpool 2' feels a lot like 'Kick-Ass,' and coincidentally 'Deadpool 2' is kick-ass. 9/10 so cashmeousside",9,6,14,1 June 2018
Silent Hill," An incredible adaption, and a truly amazing film
","'Silent Hill,' directed by Christophe Gans, who manages to build a convincing and believable mythos by giving viewers enough information to ponder and chew on without discouraging them from further research or speculation to find out more, is a consistently interesting and very effective psychological horror film that will keep you locked in and engaged throughout its entire runtime.The plot is simple: a little girl by the name of Sharon continuously gets horrific nightmares, and while she is sleeping, she screams out the name of a town, named Silent Hill. Her mother, Rose, in an attempt to find out why her daughter keeps having bad dreams while screaming this town's name, decides to take her daughter there.It's a straightforward premise, but the film's sense of mystery and dread works so well, and the history and world building of the movie is so effective, that you can't help but be completely captivated and wonder what in the world is going to happen next.One thing that makes this movie very effective is its set design; it truly is spectacular, looking eerie and hellish for the most part, but full of life when it needs to be. However, what really makes the set design so fantastic is the way the film utilizes it for its visual storytelling. For example, at one point Rose visits an abandoned school that stands dusty and derelict, but on the inside is rich in its history and visual storytelling. Religious quotes preaching vengeance are engraved in the wall of the school, the word 'witch' is carved on the surface of a student's desk, and a dead janitor is found tied up with barbed wire inside of a bathroom stall, his body twisted and contorted in impossible ways. These sights, taken separately, are all sickening in their own right, and they will make your stomach churn, but you'll find yourself unwilling to look away because of the wealth of information about the town that you'll be getting from witnessing them. However, once these things combine together to form coherency, that is when your blood will really start to boil as the horrifying truth about Silent Hill comes to light.When it comes to storytelling in general, though, 'Silent Hill' starts to falter. The way that the stories are conveyed by the clever use of setting and of the different images that are being shown is smart as it lets the audience slowly piece together the story and come to their own conclusions about what is going on. If the film would have left it at that, it would've been a brilliant example of a movie where viewers actually have to watch attentively and pay close attention to what they are being shown if they want to grasp the narrative and understand the story. 'Silent Hill' feeds us information little by little, in such a way that you really wouldn't know what you are seeing is important until after you've already seen the film, and this is a good thing, as it encourages further viewings to pick up on things that you wouldn't have noticed or fully understood the first time. Unfortunately, one scene of obvious exposition does take you out of the film, as it comes completely out of nowhere and doesn't fit into the method of storytelling that the film was previously conveying. The information that is being explained is necessary for viewers to understand the story, but such a jarring scene should've been kept on the cutting room floor and it really does feel like the producers pushed the director to put that scene in, because it goes against the clever visual storytelling that every scene prior has. But, this was a major studio release, and without the exposition the audience would most likely not have understood what was going on, but it does feel mildly insulting that the studio didn't think that the audience could've figured things out on their own.While there is the exposition scene that is incredibly jarring and, in this reviewer's opinion, unnecessary, and some cringe inducing dialogue and spotty acting, these things do not detract from the unique horror experience that this film offers. 'Silent Hill' is a very effective psychological horror film that utilizes clever visual storytelling and that isn't afraid to demand its audience to pay attention and think while they are witnessing the events unfold. If you're looking for a film that crawls under your skin, sickens your stomach, and builds a sense of mystery within you that will keep you invested and guessing throughout, then look no further than 'Silent Hill.'",7,0,0,11 April 2018
Split," Not a bad film, but left me feeling cold
","'Split' is a movie that will, no doubt, divide audiences. Advertised as a suspense thriller, what we get instead is a more nuanced and subtle film that touches on many uncomfortable topics in its first two acts, and then becomes clinically insane during its final third, but in the end left me unsatisfied. First of all, how was my man James McAvoy? Really good. Each personality that he played felt distinct and completely different from the other. Some personalities were kind and sympathetic, while others were downright menacing and oozed filth. There were even scenes where (slight SPOILER) McAvoy was playing a personality pretending to be a different personality, and as a whole his performance was brilliant. I'll be buying this film on Blu-Ray for the sole purpose of watching his acting again, and also for Anya Taylor-Joy. Not only is she the most beautiful woman I've ever seen in my life (seriously Anya if you're reading this feel free to send me a private message because I am single) but she plays a character, Casey Cooke, that has a level of depth and characterization that is unheard in modern day thrillers. She isn't just a pretty face who makes the worst possible decisions known to man, as is the norm in horror movies. She is actually a fully fleshed out character who has a past that affects her present and the choices she makes. She makes decisions that only make sense when you go home and think about the things her character went through. Things she says or does may not make complete sense until you stop and think about her characterization, and I loved that about the film. In fact, even though I didn't enjoy this film very much, I really want to go and watch it again to pick up on all the little details about her character that I missed, and this just adds replay value to the film. Anyaoustly, sorry I mean honestly, she is truly mesmerizing and has a very hypnotic quality to her that adds to the surreal and fantasy-like tone of the film. Also, the opening credits of this film were masterful. They teased a schizophrenic pace, maybe something akin to 'Inland Empire,' and even thought that isn't exactly what we got, the opening credits were enthralling nevertheless. But with all these praises, what didn't I like about the film?First off, it felt unnecessarily sexual at times. For example, (slight SPOILES in this here paragraph) one of McAvoy's personalities has extreme OCD and freaks out at the slightest hint of uncleanliness. So, when one of the girls that he kidnaps gets dust on her shirt, he makes her take it off and she spends the rest of the film in her bra. Similarly, another girl gets dust on her skirt, and if you can't guess what happens next, let me tell you: she is forced to strip off her skirt and for the majority of the movie she is seen in her underwear. Now I get it, I realize that this was meant to convey how much of a weirdo this personality is, but was it really necessary to have two females shown half naked in order to do this? The answer is no. It wasn't a necessity, and in my opinion it cheapened the experience. I didn't need to see two frightened girls forced to take their clothes off to know that this specific McAvoy personality was evil; I got that when he kidnapped the three girls in the beginning of the movie. It was just so uncomfortable (which was the goal, I know) and unnecessary, and it almost felt like, instead of wanting to contribute toward good characterization, M. Night just wanted an excuse to get these girls naked, and it overall took me out of the movie. Another thing I didn't like about this film is that nothing feels resolved at the end, and as a whole the film feels unsatisfying and unhappy. Now, I don't need every film to have a happy ending, but when you have a likable and sympathetic character like Casey, a girl who goes through what is probably some of the most traumatic experiences anyone could ever go through, at least let her have a victory at the end. (SPOILERS) Instead, what we get is an ending where it is implied that Casey, after living in Hell since her early childhood, goes home to even more unspeakable atrocities. It's 'sad', as in go home, curl into a ball, and cry for hours 'sad.' And maybe you'll like this ending, and that's fine, but for me, I didn't expect, or want, to feel suicidal walking home from the movie theatre. I'm not being funny either. I seriously felt dead on the inside for hours. And speaking of nothing being resolved at the end of this film, the ending (mild SPOILERS) of this movie is a blatant cliffhanger for a sequel that will tie up all the loose ends and complete the story. Look, I get it, sequels are popular, but if you're going to make a movie where the audience doesn't know there is going to be a sequel to, you better at least make it have a strong and satisfying conclusion, but in my opinion 'Split' has neither. And this is irritating. A movie shouldn't have to rely on a sequel to be enjoyable, especially if the audience doesn't know it's going to be the first (or second) movie in a franchise. The story feels wide open at the end of the movie, which is so disappointing, as the trailer seemed to promise a tightly crafted story. 'Split' is not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination. The acting, the directing, the production value, and the music are all great, and at times are truly masterful. However, the relentlessly bleak ending and unfinished feel of the film kept me from enjoying it.",4,30,71,24 January 2017
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," The Film Nudist reviews: Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood
","As our favorite filmmakers continue to create movies, it's important not to heap praises on their films just because we like the person making them. I was ready to do that with 'Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood' before stepping into the theatre. I heard this was a hangout movie, a sort of buddy comedy where people experience life and have a good time while doing it. And in a way, that's exactly what this movie is. As my incredibly attractive (listen, I'm not gay, Alex) friend said, the movie could be described as a bunch of non sequiturs that take place in 1960's Hollywood. On one hand, that's exactly what this movie is. But on the other hand, the last 20 minutes of the movie turn into, completely out of nowhere I might add, a surreal revenge-porn fantasy that, in my opinion, cheapened everything that came before it. While this movie is impressive on a technical level, I didn't personally consider it enjoyable. Now this might change on re-watches, but as of right now, my first impression is that this movie was, unfortunately, kind of mediocre.In terms of acting, this movie delivers. Leo and Brad deliver some of the most natural and entertaining Tarantino dialogue since 'Jackie Brown,' and it's fun to watch them hang out, drink beer, and watch TV together. And while them hanging out takes up a good majority of the scenes in this film, the main crux of it is about Leo's character, Rick Dalton, experiencing a monumental amount of self doubt regarding his apparently withering star status. And this leads to some of the best scenes in the movie. Every time Leo was seen getting into character or filming his western, playing the villain no less, was incredibly entertaining. Specifically, watch out for the scenes that feature Leo and Julia Butters, who is probably the finest actress in the entire movie. I mean, her scenes with him are magnificent. Of course, Brad Pitt was amazing as well and had some of the funniest scenes in the movie, the one with Bruce Lee especially. I haven't seen Bradley Pitts on the big screen since 'Allied,' so it was great to see the little guy in a theatre again.The set, production, and costume design were all also fantastic, but even a blind man could tell that. Now I'm not from the 1960's, so I can't speak to how accurate the portrayal of that time period was in this film. However, my grandfather is from the 1960's, but he's dead so he can't speak for that either (pour one out for my grandpa). But regardless, the sets were immaculately built and beautiful to watch on screen. The music, too, was fun to listen to, especially during scenes where Brad Pitt would just drive around. Those were great excuses for the audience to simply sit back and enjoy the music and scenery. And now let's get to the things I didn't like.As I mentioned, this movie could be seen as a slice of life type film where a bunch of characters go around and live their lives in 1960's Hollywood. And it is that, until the last 20 minutes where Tarantino had to, just had to, turn this movie into a revenge fantasy. We all know Quentin fetishizes revenge, violence, and feet (and yeah, there are like a million feet shots in this movie so if you're into feet too, no doubt you'll be creaming your pants). And in his other movies, the revenge sequences felt at least mildly earned and justifiable. But here, it literally comes out of nowhere with hardly any buildup, if you can even consider the Manson family subplot buildup in the first place. The Manson family is shown less than a handful of times in this movie, and every time they're on screen, they are hardly portrayed as threatening. Yes, we know that in real life they awfully and brutally murdered Sharon Tate. But in the context of this movie specifically, they don't do anything that warrants the brutal beat down that gets delivered to them at the end of this movie. And even if you do think that, in the context of this movie, they deserve to get killed, I personally don't think they needed to get killed in such a violent manner. I didn't want, or need, to see a woman get her face smashed repeatedly into everything within arms reach. I didn't need to see another woman get mauled by a dog while screaming horrifically for five minutes. I didn't need to see that same woman, bruised, bloodied, and battered, get torched to death by a flamethrower either, the camera almost lovingly showing her charred body in all its glory. The violence was just too much, out of nowhere, with little buildup, and no reason for it to take place besides, 'I'm Quentin Tarantino and I want my revenge on the Manson cult!''Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood' has its moments. I loved seeing Leo and Brad on screen together, and certain scenes were definitely entertaining. But as a whole, the disjointed narrative and ultra-violence was enough for this film to disappoint me.5/10",5,3,5,5 August 2019
X-Men: Apocalypse," Mediocre
","This movie was a disappointment.I was so excited for this movie. The first trailer gave me chills. I was ready. I was prepared. I was lubricated. And you know what? This movie didn't go down smooth. It was long, rough, overstuffed, and worst of all, boring.You've seen the trailer. You know that Apocalypse wants to destroy the world. Why? Who knows at this point. There's 'false Gods' and 'idols' so he'll destroy the Earth 'and from the ashes, build a better one!' But where's the real motivation? We've seen the 'bad guy wants to destroy the world and make a better one' millions of times before, and seeing it once again was not exciting in the slightest. And Apocalypse wasn't even menacing either. What were his powers? Giving motivational speeches? Seriously, all Apocalypse does is talk and talk and say the exact same things over and over. However, he did have one AWESOME line that had to do with the Tower of Babel, but other than that nothing about his character was memorable or menacing.And what about the four horsemen? They hardly did a thing. Storm? Did nothing. Angel? Nothing. Psylocke? Nothing. They were recruited, and then dropped until the climatic battle scene at the end of the film. They weren't intimidating at all. Now, the film did a good job of setting them up (except for Psylocke in my opinion, she literally had almost nothing to do at all) but once they were recruited, I don't think they said a word ever again. They just stood there, fought a bit, and that was that.Now let's talk about Jennifer Lawrence. Please, for the love of God, get another actress. It looked like she wasn't even trying in the role. She looked so incredibly bored, so incredibly dull, that it looks like she was reading her lines directly off of the script. Everyone else at least looked like they were trying, and then Ms. Lawrence comes on screen and all enthusiasm is immediately gone. And I don't hate Jennifer Lawrence. I liked her in First Class a lot, but now it just looks like she doesn't even want to be in these movies anymore.There were some good things in this film. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender were absolutely fantastic in every scene they were in. Fassbender especially had a fantastic scene in the woods, and he was about to have a fantastic scene in his place of employment (you'll know it when you see it) that was instead ruined by Apocalypse intruding and ruining the momentum. I do want to say though, that the amount of tragedy that Magneto is now suffering in this series is ridiculous. They need to stop making this character suffer over and over just for the sake of him becoming a villain; at this point it's ludicrous. McAvoy is of course great (I haven't seen him play a bad role yet) and I really hope he continues to play this role well into the future.Quicksilver returns, and his scene was just as thrilling as it was in DoFP, if a bit longer and a tad drawn out. I liked Sophie Turner as Jean Grey a lot, even if her accent was a bit spotty at times. She really did seem to be bringing her all to the role, and I look forward to watching her in future installments. I also liked how gruesome this movie was for a PG-13 film. There were some bloody, gory parts in here that literally had my jaw hit the floor, as I didn't expect to see some of the things I saw in a PG-13 superhero movie. Also, there is a sequence, that I will not spoil, that includes some very violent and very raw action, that unfortunately takes place in a section of the movie that honestly could've been cut out. The sequence, however, is great. Overall, this movie was a big disappointment, and I'm sorry to say that. I honestly thought the movie was going to be great, as I absolutely adored the first trailer, but unfortunately it is not. You can't relate or understand where the villains are coming from (except for Magneto), so it's hard for the audience to be invested in them or to care about the stakes. The amount of destruction in this film is almost pornographic, yet there is no impact as all of the carnage is seen from a distance, and not from street level, so the audience feels disconnected to everything that is happening on screen, and in a film that desperately wants its audience to fear its villains and root for its heroes, this is unforgivable, as instead being of thrilled and invested, the audience is bored and detached.",4,30,61,29 May 2016
Logan," Emotionally draining, but spectacular
","'Logan' isn't good because it's rated R; it's good because it's one of the most emotional and intense superhero movie in years. It's involving, it's dramatic, it's emotionally draining, and it's spectacular.Starring Hugh Jackman, 'Logan' is about a broken, beaten down, and tired Wolverine. He's tired of fighting. He's tired of helping people. He just wants to be left alone, and if being left alone takes an adamantium bullet in his skull, then so be it. 'Heartbreaking' is one word to describe what it feels like to watch our beloved Wolverine in this state; 'gut-wrenching' is another. In fact, this film feels like one big continuous sucker punch to the emotions over and over. It's plain sad to see Logan in this manner, and it's even sadder to see him slice and dice and gore his enemies. Like I mentioned, he doesn't want to fight. But yet, people still seem eager to fight him, and with every stab to the face and slice to the gut, the sadness becomes more tangible. The violence is so brutal and animalistic that you don't actually want to see Logan kill anyone, because he himself doesn't want to kill anyone. Killing people is all he's ever done and the more he does it the worse he feels. It's hard to watch, but it's effective. Wolverine growls, yells, and screams as he rips people to shreds, and it's like watching an animal tear into its prey. Be warned, this movie is graphic and full of extreme violence that will wear you down and exhilarate you at the same time. It's hard for me to describe exactly what it feels like watching the action scenes, but you'll know what I mean once you see the film for yourself. But this isn't to say that the action isn't cool to watch, because you best believe it is. Wolverine goes nuts in this movie, tearing arms off and stomachs open. It's brutal and it's badass and it's honestly beautiful.Hugh Jackman gives a performance so Oscar worthy that if he doesn't get nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role I may never watch the Academy Awards again. Seriously, it's a performance that you'd never expect in a big budget superhero film. He reminded me a lot of Tobey Maguire in the first three 'Spider-Man' films; Hugh was subtle and nuanced, with pain and frustration in his eyes. But when he went berserk, he held nothing back. And Dafne Keen was probably one of the best child actresses I've ever seen. The other child actors in this film? That's a different story, but she was magnificent. Patrick Stewart was amazing, do I even need to say that? It was a bit weird to hear Professor X cuss so much, but I understood why, and if I lived in that world you better believe I'd be saying the f-word as much as he does, too.This isn't a perfect movie though. Around the halfway point the film introduced a character that mildly took me out of the movie, but I can't deny that the introduction of that character brought forth some of the most intense, nail biting, and exciting fight scenes I've EVER seen. I was seriously holding my breath during the first fight scene with this character, and I didn't even notice it until the fight ended; that's how engrossing this movie is. I also disliked how little tension some of the fight scenes had. Most actions scenes feature Logan fighting a handful of evil goons, and it's fun to watch, but it's nothing we haven't seen before (except for the graphic nature of the violence). Don't get me wrong, the action was amazing, I just wish there were a few more creative set pieces instead of just having Wolverine fight some expendable goons every 25 minutes.There is also a scene of obvious, immersion breaking exposition, and the story is almost nothing new, but the fact of the matter is we've never seen Wolverine in a story like this before, and that's what makes this movie fresh. Seeing Wolverine in this broken, beaten down way is painful, but it's an intense and gripping watch. 'Logan' is definitely one of the best superhero movies that has been released in a long, long time and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.",9,6,15,10 March 2017
Midsommar," hey imdb why don't you tell my why this review has been declined there's nothing wrong with it at all and I've been a member for over 7 years
","'Midsommar' is the newest film by Ari Aster, acclaimed director of movies like 'Hereditary' and 'The Strange Thing About the Johnsons.' Now if there's one thing about me, it's that I'm depressed. More importantly than that, I absolutely loved both of the movies I just mentioned. I thought 'Hereditary' was a perfect combination of supernatural horror and family drama, mixing the genres so well that the tragedy itself adds to and becomes a part of the horror before the actual horror even begins. With 'Midsommar,' Ari Aster does something similar, starting with a family tragedy and eventually infusing it with the cultish horror that you came for.Listen, I don't want to give away too many plot points; this is a film that greatly benefits from you going in as blind as possible. What I will say is, like 'Hereditary,' 'Midsommar' looks absolutely beautiful, if not more so. From the dark, dreary opening, to the gorgeously sunlit greenery, this movie made me think to myself, 'now this is why I love movies.' I mean, the opening alone, right before the end credits, was mesmerizing and had my eyes glued to the screen; I only wish my butt was glued to my seat because I had to leave every 20 minutes to pee. Rest assured however, I didn't miss much, because luckily the bathroom was right next to the theatre.Now you might be wondering, 'just how scary is this film?' Like 'Hereditary,' this movie creeps along at a slow, methodical pace, becoming increasingly more disturbing to watch. In my opinion, it's never necessarily scary like 'Sinister' or 'Insidious' is, but the disturbing antics and actions that take place throughout the movie do make for an uncomfortable experience. 'Midsommar' deals with real life horror. Suicide, break ups, and loneliness are all topics that are touched upon. And that's what I love about Ari Aster. There isn't a working director today who can portray grief so effectively. You've seen tragedies happen in other movies, but you've never seen them portrayed so horrifically. When a particular thing happens in this movie, seeing how a character reacts to it is a gut punch. I mean, it's scary to watch because of how realistic it is. 'Midsommar' blends the horror of family tragedy with the horror of a primitive pagan cult to perfection. It's a fantastic combination, one I never thought I would see, let alone enjoy watching.And like I mentioned, when the pagan cultic shenanigans happen, your jaw will drop. I could feel the tension in the theatre when the first 'big' event happened. The suspense in the air was thick. I won't get into exactly what happens, but it's certainly worth the wait to get to it. Yes, this is a long movie, but it's never boring. It's always beautiful to look at, and there's always something interesting happening.A technically amazing drama, 'Midsommar' is a gorgeously thought provoking film. This isn't a movie for everyone because of its uncomfortable subject matter, but I do think it's more of a crowd-pleaser than 'Hereditary.' Unlike that movie, in 'Midsommar,' my packed theatre legitimately seemed to enjoy the movie, even if they were saying things like, 'that was the weirdest f**king movie I've ever seen.' Look, I really loved this movie. It's not conventional, and it's not what modern audiences will expect from a horror movie released in 2019, but I for one cannot wait to see it again.",9,1,4,12 July 2019
The Disaster Artist," Hilarious, heartfelt, dramatic, and intense
","'The Disaster Artist' was perhaps my most anticipated movie of the year. So you better believe I spent an obscene amount of money on tickets to force my family to come see this movie with me; after all, they can't say no when I already bought out a whole row of reserved seats at my local theatre. I sat down in my reclining chair, practically salivating, and not just because I bought an extra large hotdog and a cherry Coke. The trailers were painful to sit through. The theatre was packed - there hasn't been a theatre so full since 'The Simpsons Movie.' We sat through trailers about fish monster romance and people shrinking themselves for some unknown reason, and then finally, after 20 minutes, we had to sit through another preview about the cinemas new monthly reward club, and then our movie started.And immediately everyone started to laugh. The first 20 minutes of the movie brought forth practically non-stop laughter from everyone in the audience. People laughed at the small references, the visual gags, and of course, the actual jokes that the movie was making. But then, maybe after about 30 to 40 minutes, some seriously heartfelt drama started to appear, which made the movie take a turn for the better. You see, everyone expected 'The Disaster Artist' to be a goofy, silly comedy film, but in reality it is much more than that.Tommy, played masterfully by James Franco, becomes such a sympathetic character that at points the movie becomes too sad to laugh at. For example, there is a wonderfully intense scene where Tommy, when filming the infamous bellybutton sex scene, starts arguing with his film crew. It's supposed to be funny as well as dramatic, but the film paints such a sad picture of Tommy that the scene just becomes depressing. And this isn't a bad thing at all, this just shows how emotionally powerful this so-called comedy really is. Yes, the movie is very funny, but at its core this movie is a character study of Tommy Wiseau; it is a look inside of his desperately lonely but yet somewhat positive life. What I mean is, it is obvious that Tommy wanted a friend in his life, as is evident by his almost homoerotic possessiveness over Greg. But, Tommy absolutely stopped at nothing to accomplish his dream, which is, in my opinion, very commendable. 'The Disaster Artist' shows how lonely Tommy is while also showing how much he wanted to make his lifelong dream a reality, and in addition to that the film is truly funny, even though there are many points where you'll feel so bad for Tommy that you won't want to laugh at him, even though the movie wants you to.If you thought that 'The Disaster Artist' was just going to be a one-note comedy, then you better get that notion out of your head now because this film is much, much more than that. I didn't, and it was obvious that the rest of the audience didn't, expect this movie to be as dramatic and sympathetic as it was, but the drama and the study of Tommy's character and mind are truly what makes this movie as fantastic as it is, and I can tell you right now that if James Franco does not get an Oscar nomination for Best Actor then he is being robbed. Please go see this movie. It is not only one of the best comedies of 2017, not only one of the best dramas of 2017, but it is most definitely one of the best MOVIES of 2017. Anyway, how's your sex life?",9,0,2,10 December 2017
Joker," The most conflicted I've been about a rating in years
","Hey, I'm TheFilmNudist, and today I'll be review Todd Phillips' 'Joker.'There's something about this movie that feels rushed, or unfinished, which is surprising for a two hour long film. Now that's not to say this is a bad movie; it isn't. In fact, i saw it twice, enjoyed it even more the second time, and might go see it a third. There's a lot to like and even love in 'Joker;' but once the credits roll, the overall package feels disappointing.This is an incredibly watchable and entertaining film, and I can't stop thinking about it. Joaquin Phoenix gives a mesmerizing performance, and he brings Arthur Fleck to terrifying life. As Arthur, Joaquin gives a sympathetic, and totally unrelatable performance. You can 100% sympathize with this character. He's lonely, he's depressed, and he's unsatisfied with the monotony of his life. He feels unloved and purposeless, and honestly, who hasn't felt like that from time to time. So as he's getting beaten, or made fun of, or harassed, you can't help but feel bad for him. Things just go from bad to worse for Arthur, and it makes 'Joker' one of the saddest and most relentlessly bleak movies of the year. But when Arthur starts to lose it and unleash his rage on the people who he thinks deserve it, you can't help but wish he got the help he needed to curb his impulses. It's not fun watching him turn into the Joker; instead of feeling the excitement I anticipated, I just felt sadder and sadder while watching Arthur lose his mind and become the titular villain we all know. But I can't deny that it was effective viewing. In 'Suicide Squad' and 'The Dark Knight,' viewers will most likely root for the Joker and want to see what villainous shenanigans he pulls off next. But in this, I assume most viewers will be increasingly frustrated and disgusted with Arthur's behavior, which is effective. This is the first time in a long time I can actively remember being turned off by the villain and wishing he would turn toward good.And while I wouldn't necessarily say that this movie has a lot of depth to it, there is certainly enough to keep you thinking about it for days afterward. I don't want to spoil anything specific, but the opening and the ending specifically have a lot of meat to chew on if you stop to think about it. The movie arguably starts at exactly the moment when Arthur starts his descent towards being the Joker, and ends at arguably the moment when Joker is thinking about creating his arch-nemesis, and both scenes are masterful at instilling a sense of dread within the viewer.The directing, cinematography, and score are also all top notch. Every scene, every frame, and every sound worked together fantastically to evoke emotion within the viewer; there are scenes in here that I cannot stop thinking about because of how twistedly beautiful they were. One scene in particular after Arthur commits his first crime is so gorgeously dark that I want to see the film again just to witness that particular sequence on the big screen once more. And of course, needless to say, the acting is incredible and if Mr. Phoenix doesn't win an Oscar for best actor then I'll be jumping off a bridge (I'll take any excuse at this point).Like I said, there's a ton to love about this film. But I can't help but shake the feeling that the movie should have been at least another hour longer. The film ends as soon as it's getting going; it really leaves you wanting more. And while that is a good thing in theory, in reality it just leaves the audience mildly unsatisfied. I mean, all spoilers aside, Arthur finally becomes Joker within the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie, and in my personal opinion, this doesn't really give the audience enough to be completely satisfied. Yes, I know this is a character study about Arthur, but the movie is called 'Joker,' and seeing the Clown Prince of Crime is something that the audience is expecting to see. And they do see it, but most likely not as much as they'd like.I haven't agonized this much over a rating in a long time. I did really enjoy this movie (more the second time than the first when I had time to process how dark and depressing it is), and the overall look and feel of the movie is important; this movie looks like an arthouse film, and has a slow burn typical of an arthouse film, and the fact that it is being widely released to general audiences in the guise of a super villain movie is in my eyes a milestone of cinema. But, even though I loved the acting and directing of this movie, I can't help but wish the plot would've been deeper and longer than it actually is.I know it seems like I'm being very nitpicky, but this is a very hard film to review without explicit spoilers. Yes, I really loved multiple aspects of the film, and I can't wait to see it again. But the overall package felt short-winded and in need of more footage. Overall, I would recommend you going to see 'Joker,' but don't go expecting the action packed super villain romp that you may expect.6/10",6,0,3,6 October 2019
Black Panther," So mediocre
","'Black Panther' is just another, average superhero movie if we're being honest. It's been getting rave reviews, but in my opinion it is massively over-hyped. And no, I didn't go into this movie wanting to hate it. In fact, I was excited walking into the theatre. But after the first dimly lit, poorly shot action scene, I knew I was in for a wild ride into mediocrity.First of all, let's talk action because most people go see superhero movies for the high-octane action sequences. Literally every action sequence in this movie, except for maybe one, were awful. Why is that? Take the first action sequence that I mentioned above: it was so dimly lit and filled with shaky camera that the action was incomprehensible. And that was incredibly disappointing because it set the standard for what is to be expected, quality wise, when it came to the action, for the rest of the movie. Another big action scene that takes place in a type of underground South Korean casino had the same problem: shaky camera. Sure, the action is shown in a very clever one shot take that was cool to watch, but when the action can't be clearly seen because the camera is shaking and because the camera is too close up that the action is off-screen, the entire scene loses its entertainment factor. There is one action scene that I thought was exciting (it's towards the end and so you know exactly what scene I'm talking about, let's just say that it ends with someone being thrown off of a high place), but pretty much the only reason I thought it was exciting was because I really enjoyed one of the characters involved in the fight. And yes, it was better shot then the rest of the action scenes, but I've seen much better shot and more exciting action scenes in other Marvel films, like 'Winter Soldier,' for example. And when an action film doesn't have good action, it's just disappointing.Also, the titular Black Panther was one of the blandest main characters I've ever seen. I didn't connect with him at all. Killmonger, on the other hand, I could connect with. For the most part his rationale made sense, and at one point I even thought, 'How is this guy the villain? He wants to do a good thing.' BUT THEN, FOR SOME REASON, Killmonger's actions as a villain take a completely different turn and it seems like he completely changed his mind and wanted to do something entirely different. Maybe I just didn't get what he wanted to do or maybe I didn't understand how he wanted to complete his goals, but it was super stupid because his original goal absolutely did not need to be completed in the way he was going about it. I mean, when you get down to it, what Killmonger wanted to do was noble; it was something no leader of Wakanda was willing to do, or wanted to do, in the past, so I was totally on board with him and honestly, I wanted him to win. In fact, I kind of think Killmonger was the hero of the film - he just went the wrong way in trying to accomplish what he wanted, but if he would've accomplished his goal, there is no doubt that the positive consequences would have far outweighed the negative.I really have not much else to say. This was just an ordinary superhero movie that did nothing new; it was bland. The villain was cool and gives viewers a lot of food for thought, but the action sucked, which pretty unforgivable, in my opinion, and every other character except Killmonger was forgettable. Other than that, yea, you can see this and maybe you'd like it but I don't recommend it. It's just a boring film - I was bored and I wanted it to end.",4,3,6,27 March 2018
Mother!," Incredibly pretentious
","I've been wanting to watch 'Mother!' ever since I saw the first teaser trailer years ago in theatres. I had no idea what the movie was about because of the minimalistic tone of the teaser, but that intrigued me all the more. For one reason or another I missed out on seeing this movie in theatres, but that was probably for the best, because 'Mother!' is one of the most boringly heavy-handed and pretentious films I have ever seen.From start to finish, 'Mother!' will lull you into a gentle slumber. Even when the happenings start to get wild and wacky, the film still seems to move along at a snails pace. It doesn't help that the goings on are completely unbelievable and utterly ridiculous. Look, I get what Darren Aronofsky was going for here. It's really not hard to understand what he was trying to convey through the visual medium of film, but it doesn't suddenly excuse the fact that at some point he stops telling a story and starts pleasuring himself all over the screen.The movie is filled with religious metaphors that are beat over your head so much that by the end of the movie I wouldn't be surprised if you had a concussion. At first the religious themes are mildly subtle (as subtle as one brother killing another and then running into the wilderness can be), but by the final 30 minutes, all realism is thrown out the window for instead a collage of scenes that satirize Christianity, including the Catholic faith. And I don't have a problem with this; believe me, when it comes to Catholicism, there's a lot to criticize. But at least do it in a way that's not immediately noticeable and extremely blatant. I mean, the story stops so Aronofsky can throw in a million different critiques and references to Christianity, so much so that by the end he is basically remaking the book of Genesis.Now I won't lie: there was one scene that actually made me gasp in surprise because of how suddenly the violence occurred. In a better movie, that scene would've changed the entire trajectory of the film. Unfortunately, because 'Mother!' commits to being a metaphor instead of having a plot, the moment, while shocking, has no lasting impact on the viewer or the narrative. It ultimately serves no purpose, and neither does this movie.2/10",2,3,6,14 October 2019
Jojo Rabbit," Beautiful and heartbreaking
","'Jojo Rabbit' is a movie I wasn't particularly excited to see, but one I went to see because my cousin, a strapping young gentleman, wanted to see. And for the first half, I could tell he was enjoying it. He was laughing hard at the slapstick comedy, the silly antics of one of the silliest men alive, Adolf Hitler, and at the clever little lines that the film liked to throw at its audience. I, however, wasn't enjoying what I was seeing. I liked the concept, but the humor just wasn't clicking with me. And then, something changed.'Jojo Rabbit' is one of my favorite films of 2019, without a doubt. At around the halfway mark, it became, for me, one of the most beautiful and hopeful, but also tragic, films I've seen. A fantastical surrealistic masterpiece, 'Jojo Rabbit' isn't meant to be taken too seriously. Perhaps that's because the film takes place from the eyes of a child, but regardless, it helps if you approach this movie as more of a fantasy than a drama.I don't want to get into plot specifics or spoilers, and that's more out of laziness because I just drank a full glass of Woodford Reserve bourbon whiskey and I'd like to play some Death Stranding before going to bed, alone. Regardless, however, I would like to talk specifically about what made this movie resonate with me personally, and why I believe it is one of the best films of the year: 'Jojo Rabbit' deals with distressing topics, which is obvious given the subject matter and plot synopsis, but also with relateable topics from young love and romance to the notion that often in this life we are born one thing, and then die another based on the choices that we make along the way.There are scenes of pure beauty that had me awestruck and feeling butterflies in my stomach. There are sequences of crippling sadness that had me gasp and hold back tears. And there are sections of the film that are so intense I was literally holding my breath, my heart racing. God, I just wish I as back in the theatre right now reliving this film. Certain scenes will be burnt into my memory for as long as I live because of how gorgeous, sensual, powerful, and inspiring they were. Other scenes will have my awake at night because of how suspenseful and scary they were to watch unfold. 'Jojo Rabbit' has it all, and I cannot emphasize enough how much I loved this film.Now no movie is perfect, and with great power comes great responsibility; this movie is no exception. There were times where I felt like the lighthearted tone was unnecessary and even inappropriate, especially during the last half of the film when certain things were going down. I didn't mind the tone in the beginning, but towards the end when things are getting very serious and intense, I thought the jokiness of certain scenes could have been left out to make the goings on more impactful. However, once I took the film as the fantasy it is meant to be, this didn't bother me too much.Part coming of age and loss of innocence, part fantasy, and part romance, 'Jojo Rabbit' is an absolutely beautiful film, and one I'm so happy I went to see. Please, my words do not, and can not, do this movie justice. Go see it.9/10",9,1,3,27 December 2019
Green Book," A fun, feel good film
","Let's be honest: the trailer for this film made it look like a typical, Oscar-baiting, end of the year awards contender, and in a way it is. We can't deny it - the Oscars love their films about racists turning from their prejudiced ways, and about people struggling through the atrocities of racism and bigotry, and this trailer just looked like more of the same; it's hard to get excited about a film when it looks like it was put together by a bunch of studio executives whose only thoughts were, 'How can we win the Oscar this year?' But if there's one man I have faith in, one man who is a light in a dim, dark world, it's Viggo Mortensen, so I held out hope because if there's one thing Mr. Mortensen doesn't do, it's star in bad movies. And you know what? 'Green Book' is most certainly not a bad movie. In fact, it's pretty darn excellent.Look, is this movie Oscar bait? Yes. But is it well-done Oscar bait? Oh yes, it is. Immediately this movie is entertaining, right from the beginning. It's never overly melodramatic, nor too serious, like 'Crash,' the so-called king of Oscar bait. Instead, while it is still maddening to watch people be casually and unflinchingly racist, 'Green Book' has an overall softer, more lighthearted, and humorous tone throughout. And this very fun and entertaining tone was a much needed change of pace from other Oscar bait films, which tend to emotionally manipulate audiences by tugging at their heartstrings, using emotion, instead of quality, to trick their audiences into thinking they just saw a good movie. 'Green Book' is straight-up entertaining from beginning to end, and has more than its fair share of laugh out loud moments.Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali also had amazing, standout chemistry. I mean, watching these two guys drive around, become friends, crack jokes, and stand up for each other? I loved it. The movie could've been 4 hours long of them driving around and I would've loved every second because watching these two men interact is some of the most fun time I've had at the movies. Viggo Mortensen is amazing in practically everything he's ever been in, and 'Green Book' is no exception. He plays a character with such a strong personality that when he's on screen, you really can't take your eyes off of him. And Mahershala Ali, too, plays a character with a unique personality, just a very different one. And regardless, seeing both characters change, and change each other, for the better was riveting and highly entertaining viewing; they played off of each other so well, and you really feel like you become friends with them as you're watching them go on their cross-country journey.Obviously, this isn't a perfect film. The direction does feel a little stagnant; yes, the acting is phenomenal, but the film feels very glossy and glazed over, just a little too 'high-definition,' for lack of a better word. Also, there are a few moments that do feel a little on the nose (look for the scene with people working in a field), but overall I found this movie to be an incredibly fun and entertaining time at the theatre. The acting is really, really good, the story is endlessly entertaining thanks to the marvelous chemistry between the two lead characters, and the message is undoubtedly important. If you want to have a good time at the movies this holiday season, you don't have to look much further than 'Green Book.'",9,0,1,1 December 2018
Incredibles 2," Good, not great, and definitely not incredible
","'Incredibles 2' is definitely an enjoyable movie, filled with enough action, heart, and comedy to entertain anyone - if there's one thing I can say with confidence, it's that this movie will be a crowd pleaser. From beginning to end this movie is fun. The action scenes are incredible, no pun intended, and are directed beautifully. There's definitely a lot of humor and silliness to make you laugh, and laugh hard. And it's just plain entertaining to watch this family interact - in fact, the heart of these movies lies in the interaction between the family, but unfortunately, there really isn't all that much of it in this film. The majority of the movie, when there aren't action scenes, is Mr. Incredible taking care of Jack-Jack, which does serve a purpose but in this reviewer's opinion made the film seem unbalanced. I get it, Jack-Jack is cute, he's adorable, and he makes the entire audience erupt in laughter, but where's the character progression and heart-to-heart moments with Dash and Violet? Yes, there are a few moments of sweetness and familial bonding between Mr. Incredible and his two other children (mostly with Violet, hardly any with Dash, and in fact Dash had absurdly little to do in this movie) but compared to the time the movie focuses on Mr. Incredible with Jack-Jack, his interaction with his other children feels minuscule. I mean, there was so, so much 'Incredibles 2' could've done with Bob and Violet especially. Don't get me wrong, there are some very sweet moments between them, but the film could have and indeed should have explored many more aspects of the reality of what it is like for a father raising a teenage daughter that has to deal with liking boys, going through 'adolescence,' as Dash calls it, and perhaps the thing that all fathers dread: being a superhero. Instead, the movie focuses on two things, the first being Bob dealing with Jack-Jack and his newfound powers, and while this isn't ideal, I'll be damned if it didn't lead to some truly hilarious moments. The second thing the movie revolves around is Elastigirl as she works her new job, which results in a ton of action sequences. Now, these action sequences are slick and visually stunning, but action sequences were not what made the first movie great - what made the first movie great was the entire family interacting each other and dealing with real life problems while just happening to be superheroes, and this film doesn't seem to realize this, instead resorting to bombastic action sequences. And I'll say it again: the action is great, it's exciting, it's adrenaline inducing, but god damn it, did we need so much of it? It just feels like the ridiculous amount of action in this movie kind of cheapens the experience, at least in my opinion. Because what could've been a very mature movie like the first one was, turned into a movie that seemed much more childlike than it had any right to be. Maturity, too, is another thing that this movie sacrifices. The first one dealt with very adult topics and this movie, well, doesn't. Sure, there is a truly amazing and I mean AMAZING monologue that the villain has, and once I heard it I got excited because I started thinking, 'wow, I can't believe they're taking this film in this mature direction, this is going to be great,' because the monologue dealt with very real things and it seemed to even be pointing at the audience and blaming them, in a way. But after that monologue, those motivations go out the window and the 'true' motivations are revealed, and it's just disappointing. They could've taken that initial idea so much further, but just like everything else, they resort to taking the easier, more digestible, choice. So the villain, initially someone with motives that we've literally never seen before in any superhero film, turns into someone whose motives are not only lazy, but predictable. Now I know I might seem like I'm bashing the crap out of this film, but I'm not really. I enjoyed myself and I can't wait to buy it on Blu-Ray to watch it again, but after 14 years, I'd say we deserve better.",7,4,9,17 June 2018
Alien: Covenant," Enjoyable, gorgeous, thought provoking science-fiction
","I'm a big fan of 'Prometheus,' so when I saw that Best Buy was selling this bad boy for the low, low price of ten dollars, I was sold. I bought it, took it home, and put it right on my shelf for a few weeks until yesterday I figured the time was right, right to watch what I assumed would be the sequel to 'Prometheus.' And it is, kind of. You see, 'Alien: Covenant' is not a direct sequel to 'Prometheus,' as it takes place 10 years later. However, a few of your favorite characters may or may not return, and your favorite creature may or may not be hugging some faces.Here's the thing. The 'Alien' franchise has a very loyal audience and a deep mythos that's easy to get absorbed in. And while watching 'Prometheus' and 'Alien: Covenant,' it's kind of easy to see that Ridley Scott might be making things up as he goes along. However, that doesn't stop these movies from being highly philosophical and exceedingly interesting. The best parts of these movies, and this movie specifically, is when it deals with the subjects of creation, God, and life. The opening scene is extremely riveting, featuring an android gaining the knowledge of immortality for him, and inevitable death for his human creator. This film deals with a bunch of interesting topics, and I was enthralled by the questions that were brought up.But, if you're watching a movie with 'Alien' in the title, chances are you're looking for some alien violence, and boy do you get it. The action in this movie was intense, thrilling, and white-knuckle. The very first, and very last set pieces were so exciting that my heart was actually racing, something that hasn't happened to me while watching a movie in a long time. And the aliens are a bit different in this movie, as well. They can run, and run fast, moving sporadically and unpredictably, and in my opinion, this just added to their horrifying nature, because how can you defeat something when you don't know what it's going to do next?This may get me crucified, but I think Ridley Scott, when it comes to action, is a mediocre director. For some reason, he seems to enjoy adding a lot of shaky camera to his action scenes, which I find very distracting. However, when it comes to this movie, he didn't overdo it, and I found that the slight shaky cam actually enhanced the intensity; there were times where I legitimately found it hard to watch because of how insane things were getting. And again, I'm not saying Ridley Scott is a bad director, because when it comes to science-fiction, the man is a God. Seriously, this movie is gorgeous. There are shots and sequences that I can't stop thinking about it. I mean, just watch the trailer and tell me that the film doesn't look incredible. Any other director and this movie wouldn't look as good as it does. Say whatever you want about Scott, the man knows science-fiction, and the man puts impeccable, beautiful detail into all of his movies. Seriously, this is the best-looking film I've seen in a long time, and simply how lovely his movies look is what makes 'Alien: Covenant' as good as I think it is. The acting was also very good by everyone, even though the characterization was lacking. I have heard that there are scenes on YouTube that were taken out of the film that expand on the characters and add some much-needed characterization, and maybe this is laziness on my part, but I didn't watch them because I don't think a film should require homework before I watch it. However, because I loved this movie as much as I did, I will definitely go back and watch it. And even though the characters are a bit bland, that doesn't stop the performances from being excellent. Katherine Waterston especially was not only the most attractive woman I've ever seen on screen before in my life, but also gave a very explosive, emotional performance that I won't soon forget. James Franco too was on fire in this movie, and I'll leave it at that.'Alien: Covenant' is one of the best science-fiction movies I've seen in a long time. It's just so existential, contemplative, and thought-provoking, as well as exciting, suspenseful, thrilling, and horrifying. It's not just a movie you can put on and enjoy because of the violence and action, but it's a movie that brings up life-questions, a movie that deals with creation and creator, a movie that questions what it means to be a created being, and what it means to be a creator, and it's all of these things that elevate this film to new heights. Because, being an 'Alien' film, all they really had to do was rehash previous plot points; they could've made a 2-hour movie about people being trapped on a ship and stalked by an alien - rinse and repeat, give us money please. But this film doesn't do that. It challenges its audience, brings up incredibly interesting philosophical questions, and leaves a ton of things open for interpretation and discussion, and I don't have a doubt in my mind that I'll be thinking of this movie and theorizing about it for a long, long time.9/10",9,4,5,16 October 2018
