Skyfall," It was a nice touch adding the roots to the equation.
","I would say that the movie was a nine but there were a few flaws. What I enjoyed about the movie was that for the first time, the movie was entirely about Bond and M and the past of them. How a past villain shows up and they go to Bond's home and how they prepare the finale with it. I think the movie's plot really fitted the finale. In the beginning, I thought to myself, what the ef, is this a Bond movie? It's so not clear.But as the movie carries on, you see that they added something new this time, making it less of a Bond and a girl thing and more of a Bond thing. I also liked the acting of Q. I think he was picked out very well and I really liked his character as he played. And Javier Bardem puts on quite and act.What I didn't like was, the plot was apparently supposed to be about Bond's past. That wasn't so clear. Throughout the movie, there are blank spots. Like they wanted to keep it thrilling and not so much drama but there are blank points. That's the only flaw that I see. Like they start something in the beginning and for the rest of the movie, it just turns to catching the person who did it and nothing about the action. But the locations were well-chosen and used. I especially liked Macau because it gave a classic Bond scene. I think the movie was quite fine and actually it was amazing. And you should totally go see it.",9,5,13,3 November 2012
