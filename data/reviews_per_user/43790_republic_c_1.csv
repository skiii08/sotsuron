Iron Man 3," go watch it
","this movie is excellent, go, watch it and then make your opinion about it, there is people that will like it, there is people that wont but no matter what anyone says, it is an entertaining movie, with good acting, good visuals, and suitable for even the youngest marvel fans. i am a big comic book fan and i have read iron man in its entirety, and as an iron man comic book fan i seriously recommend it, however if you want to really enjoy the movie. 1. if you have never read an iron man comic or even seen one of the first iron man movies do not expect this movie to be what you think it will be just go and enjoy it 2. if you are an avid iron man comic book reader like me, do not expect it to be the comics, remember the marvel cinematic universe is like an alternate universe, assume it as such and go enjoy the movie",10,8,20,1 May 2013
