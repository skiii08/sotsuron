Walk the Line," rather hear Johnny sing!
","I want to hear the voices of the REAL Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash!Yes, I have the music but with this movie, Geez are we all missing a huge point here? Great to have John's life played well but I would rather have heard their songs. Joaguin doesn't look like John or sound like John or does Reece sound or look like June. It just doesn't work for me knowing the haunting sound of Johnny's voice. Its his voice that brings the legend full circle. The man in black with the deep sad songs is not portrayed in this movie. I hope that if anything, this movie will make wonder of the man and seek his voice and songs and the roots of June's Carter family.",4,2,9,12 January 2006
Bad Teacher," Loved Bad Teacher!
",Great funny blackish comedy! Cameron YOU ROCK! I want to see more of this type! If you don't get the joke..you are a MAW-RON...! Great comedy well played by Miss Diaz! And Justin Timberlake playing against type was great too. Every time I watch it I smile and laugh and thats what its all about. I was reminded of another fave Heartbreakers with its bawdy over the top humor. Funny part? Her coming into house and saying 'im going to ...' and his parents being there. Funny part? Cameron not being able to get high and then banging on liquor store not knowing closed for holiday. Funny part? Cameron banging her fist and shouting at kids running in hall due to fustration with Timberlake. And so much more!,9,6,11,26 September 2012
