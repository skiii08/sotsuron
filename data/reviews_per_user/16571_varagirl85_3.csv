Casablanca," Almost flawless film
","It is one the most exquisitely well thought out and put together film in history. If you are not paying attention right from the beginning, you'll miss the beginning set-up, which is the key to appreciating the rest of the film. What really makes the movie is the importance and urgency of the time that the film is set -- for all the characters in this story, for this one small gin joint and this one very obscure city, for all of Europe and all the world. What is particularly important is the desperation of this moment in history. It is brilliantly boiled down into a tableau of detailed interwoven personal stories of greed, power and need, love and sacrifice, loyalty and betrayal. The acting is flawless across the board with these iconic actors really shinning; the screenplay dialogue is smart, witty, with hardly an unnecessary word; the direction and cinematography are flawless, with each scene framed like a movie poster; and the musical numbers contribute the environment and the emotional gravitas without making the film be contrived. I had to watch this film twice before I could fully appreciate it; there's that much to take in.",9,2,3,25 January 2013
The Big Lebowski," A complete waste of time
","I am thinking to myself 'what are you people watching?' for those who found this film in the slightest funny. This was bad, just plain bad. The only positive comment I would have is with Turturro's character. He is the sole standout. I found myself getting very upset and hating Bridges' and Goodman's characters. If this was the directors' motivation, then they succeeded big time. I think that the actors - Buscemi, Turturro, and Hoffman - all got lulled into a false sense by the success of the directors previous film - Fargo. What a shame and bad move. The film totally misses its point of being this off-beat quirky comedy. I can't say it enough, it was painful watching Goodman's character say the same stupid line to Buscemi â€“ over and over. A complete waste of time.",2,11,25,25 January 2013
Gone with the Wind," A great classic movie
","This movie is absolutely favorite. Watching Scarlett transition from a very pampered, very spoiled, very whiny, very self-centered plantation belle to a woman of great spirit and strength was remarkable. I love the fact that she will do whatever it takes to save her beloved plantation Tara. This characters personal growth of the heart takes some time and I wanted to shake her several times as she lets her beloved Rhett slip away. The character of Melanie makes me want to love her for her deep quiet strength and it is this character that is the one person in the film who truly understands Scarlett. The character of Mammie is just hilarious as the nanny who has raised many of the O'Haras. Her comments about Rhett as being a mule in a horse's harness is just reflective of the brilliant well constructed screenplay. All in all, a great classic movie.",10,1,1,25 January 2013
