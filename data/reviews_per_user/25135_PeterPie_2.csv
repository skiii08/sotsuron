The Blair Witch Project," The biggest waste of 8 bucks
","I had heard very good buzz about the film. My own sister came home freaked up, claiming she was crying from fear from the movie. Right then I knew I had to see it. I went into the theater very excited. What I saw was a waste of a Saturday Night. The film was creative yet lacking. It was not that scary, and the s-called 'amazing' performances showed off true fear, but the whining irratated me. If I want to hear whining for an hour and a half, I'll babysit my niece. The only truly frightening moment is the end which I won't give away. Check it on TV. You miss nothing from the theater. It is not even widescreen. If you do see it in the theater, bring the alka seltzer, the shaky camera will make you feel sick. Truly a waste of eight bucks.",Null,0,1,31 August 1999
54," A good movie for people who like movies about crack-sniffing geriatrics
","Ryan Phillippe plays Shane O'Shea (a name that could only be used in porno movies and bad movies like this) a young dreamer from New Jersey who dreams of making it to New York and going to Studio 54, the biggest club of the 70's and meeting the girl of his dreams, soap opera star, Julie Black (Neve Campbell) Well, he does make it to New York and his good looks allows him to go inside and to meet the club's homosexual owner, Steve Rubell (Mike Myers) and get a job as a bus boy. He meets fellow bus-boy, Greg (Ryan's long time friend, Breckin Meyer) and his coat check girl/aspiring singer wife, Anita (Salma Hayek) and lives with them. Of course Shane makes it big as a bartender and makes connections and poses for gay magazines and sleeps with every woman he sees, and then comes the down hill. Everyone weeps their sob stories and rise above them, but are still stuck in this terrible movie that centers around drugs, alcohol, sex, and bad film making. The end is one of the worst ending in film history when an 80 year old woman overdoses on crack on the floor of the dance floor on New Year's Eve. This movie is bad, that's about all I can say. The original cut was supposed to have been great, giving Ryan the ability to show of his acting talents like in Little Boy Blue, White Squall, etc. but due to extreme editing, all he does is stand around and act pretty. Neve Campbell is given little to do, including a terrible Jewish-New York accent and Salma Hayek is very pathetic as she tries to make the best of this train wreck of a movie. The less said about Ellen Dow the better. Breckin Meyer is able to show off his ability as Greg and ends up being the saving grace of the film.",Null,0,0,2 September 1999
