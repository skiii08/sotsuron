Sucker Punch," Criminally underrated, visual masterpiece
","When I decided to watch this film I had pretty low expectations due to the battering it received from most critics. However I was I fan of director Zack Snyder's work and this film enticed me quite a bit so I decided to finally check it out after many years.And wow, this film rocks!!! And here's why:The plot follows a girl known only as Babydoll who due to some unfortunate circumstances, has been sent to a institution for the mentally ill. We soon discover she is there to be lobotomized (made brain dead) in five days time. To cope with her impending doom, Babydoll imagines that the mental hospital is a completely different place, a brothel in fact, filled with many interesting people. One thing leads to another and Babydoll soon discovers that to escape this place, she must acquire five items which she does by entering various types of imagination worlds such as the trenches of WW1 or a medieval castle all while kicking some major ass in the process to hopefully eventually gain freedom.The cast of this film contains some real knockouts for the male audience including Emily Browning, Abbie Cornish and Jamie Chung who are all freaking gorgeous and certainly believable as female bad asses. However, the cast member who truly shines in this film is Oscar Issac who plays Blue, the owner of the brothel. Isaacs performance was absolutely fantastic as he expertly pulls off a man who genuinely thinks he in the right but is really a cold blooded psycho.The most visually appealing part of this film (apart from the female cast of course) was the action. Seeing as this was helmed by Mr Snyder, I expected to go 'wow' to some of the action scenes, and I certainly did. There are many varied action scenes in this film that boast excellent camera-work, stunts, effects, music and just overall badassery and the WW1 and train scene in particular p, had me smiling the whole way through.Speaking of the score, it's absolutely mesmerizing, featuring songs such as Sweet dreams and Army of me to set a grungy dire atmosphere really, really well. One thing to note with this film's soundtrack is that most of the songs featured, are actually covered by cast members including Emily Browning and Oscar Isaac which I found really admirable.Now I could see how someone could dislike this film due to its sometimes incoherent storyline and sometimes lazy dialog and don't get me wrong this film isn't perfect or anything but to me, I had a genuinely fun time seeing these characters go on a visually stunning and very unique adventure. If I had to sum up this film in one sentence, it would be this. Sucker punch is a blend of mis matched action sequences tied together with a unique storyline and plenty of hot chicks. If that sounds like something you would like to see then I strongly recommend you watch this film asap and give it the attention and appreciation that it deserves.",8,7,12,10 April 2016
