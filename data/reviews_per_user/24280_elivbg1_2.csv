Lucky Number Slevin," Empty
","This is one of the movies that I have liked least for quite a while. Although it has some potential including some good cast members, to me it totally fails to deliver anything meaningful. The whole story line left me feeling kind of empty. There was nothing to connect to in the movie on a human level- its main disadvantage to me was that it was simply not real and the story seemed to have no moral. On the positive side, it is not completely boring; there is some action (though too much senseless blood), there is some 'witty' dialogue, some intrigue. But all in all, those advantages were not enough to offset the feeling that the movie had no real meaning. It is probably a question of individual preference.",3,0,3,12 March 2010
"I Love You, Man"," Not impressed
","I watched a good chunk of this movie, haven't quite finished it yet. So, I guess I am finding it very hard to relate to any of it. The basic premise that having even a single good friend sometimes can be a challenge is a realistic one and one that may be interesting to write or talk about. However, I just did not get into the way that this particular movie goes about presenting the premise and the resolution. There just seemed to be a lot of clich√© talk, some vulgarities and whatnot, and characters that had too little screen time and too few meaningful lines to really make an impression. Paul Rudd can sometimes be an engaging lead but he wasn't to me in this one. There was a certain air of fakeness that went with the whole movie, which I didn't appreciate; the most 'honest' part of the movie was the somewhat profane language. All in all, I was left unimpressed.'Role models', which is kind of similar seemed like a much better movie.",5,6,10,26 September 2010
