Lucky Number Slevin," Lucky Number Slevin Rocks!
","I just saw this flick on night shift, and I can't believe how anyone who truly watched give it a bad on the reviews.This one rocks. I have not seen anything remotely entertaining like this recently. OK, it starts a little bit on a clumsy note, what with horses, some sex, and a couple of murders, but these immediately sets you on course.What the first 45minutes of LNS does is to promise you a journey, take you halfway, and get you lost. Then you ultimately begin finding your way, or at least trying to...Well, to truly enjoy this, you need to be extra-attentive, I mean pay ultimate attention to clues, (you 're gonna need them in the end) watch out for the camera fading on things, elevators, finger rings, wrist watches, and just try to lock onto the puzzle, by the 60th minute, you ' ll find your way.I liked the performance of the girl Lindsey best on this movie although everyone did their roles perfectly, and yeah, there loads of one-liners here. The dialogue was simple, but well delivered enough to keep you stuck on. The storyline here wasn't bad but kudos to the direction, they made it all come out.Maybe this won't win an Oscar ( & why not:) but it is grand entertainment from play to the end....SEE IT!",9,0,2,2 August 2007
