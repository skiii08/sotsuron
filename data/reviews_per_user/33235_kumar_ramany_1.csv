Casablanca," So Human
","I loved every frame of this movie. In all its aspects, be it photography, filming, presentation and the last but not the least the acting by Henry and Ingrid. God. Its so Awesome. Some of the scenes were so beautifully picturised and depicted, my most memorable scenes are the one when Ilsa comes back to the bar to see Rick and Rick says i have kept the first drink for you (or similar to that not exact dialogue of course). In that scene both have done well and so human. Rick behaved like a normal man who would have behaved the way he does in the movie, when you encounter your or meet your broken love. Similarly Ilsa also acts trying to explain the circumstances.I wish we could get more movies like this.",9,0,2,9 June 2006
