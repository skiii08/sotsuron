The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Perfect Teen/Adolescent Angst
","Great movie, tugged at the heartstrings, not just because it was relatable. Great book, cast did a pretty phenomenal job filling the roles (maybe because we all go through something like this growing up) especially impressed with Ezra Miller, and Emma Watson liked Logan in this more than PJO.",10,0,0,27 January 2019
