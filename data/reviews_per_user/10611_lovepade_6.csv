Catch Me If You Can," Surprisingly good movie!!!
","!!!CONTAINS ITZY BITZY MINOR SPOILERS!!!
This movie is good, no doubt about it! I especially loved the sixties feel, very neatly captured by Spielberg. Leonardo is Leonardo as we know him, doing what he does best. Hanks is perfectly cast, and I was surprised that his face didn't bother me once, as it usually does.The story is intriguing and the tempo of the movie is high. Christopher Walken steals the picture with his exceptional performance.The father-son theme of the movie actually works very well which is a rarity for this kind of film.I would rate it 8/10, but (being a European) the depiction of the French police takes one point off the score. However the Music by Frank Williams, and the intro (which captures the spirit of both the film and the sixties) gives that point back.One could argue that the film idealizes Abigales criminal career, and that the morale of the film is, that as long as you do something good, everything will work out for you  even if your special talent is crime. However, as this film is based on a true story, and since movies in my opinion are not supposed to lecture or mould the viewer, I stand by my 8/10 (even though the movie is not breathtaking, it's a tiny bit more than just professional work).",7,0,1,5 February 2003
Casablanca," One of the best ever!
","This film works surprisingly well sixty years after its original release. The story unfolds, and as it does it genuinely sucks the viewer in. You actually care about what happens to these people.The pictures are beautiful and the acting is superb. Bogart of cause shimmers with his unique mix of poppy eyes, heart broken righteousness, and very masculine stoutness. Yes - we have yet to see his like.It's easy: 10/10(ohh: By the way, all the actors are marvellous characters: From the fat, patriotic waiter, to the French police inspector  and needless to mention: Ingrid Berman!)",10,2,2,3 February 2003
Léon: The Professional," Original and beautiful
","Sympathetic theme, inspiring idea, mostly well acted and very beautifully shot. However the movie is 20 minutes too long, and due to the uniqueness of the characters the course of action sometimes becomes too unrealistic. But I'll guess that depends on how much one is willing to accept? 8/10 (the movie is 7/10 but because of its original script  its an eight)",8,0,1,9 February 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Art cinema? Homage and nothing more - OUTSTANDING!
","There a at least three ways to review this movie: The moralist one (0/10); the 'usual' one focusing on tension, plot, charachter etc. (5/10) and then the film buffs fantasy 10/10.The movie has many factual faults. It is unrealistic etc. and yawn yawn. The point of this movie is that its a tribute to especially Sergio Leone and Martial Arts movies.however this is not all. The picture composation and colors, the scenematography is absulotely stunning.

Signs," Interesting but unsatisfying approach to religion
","Signs is a good suspense movie. It works in a slow pace with the 'keep it simple stupid' motto. We hardly see the aliens, but they are constantly felt around the protagonist. It worked for Ridley Scott in `Aliens' and its working quite good for Shyamalan.(small spoilers - coming up)Mel Gibson's kids are scary as hell. They have lost their mother, and as the fargo-like policewoman says ` has gone through a lot'. Even considering that, they are still very `stiff' in their performance. However I think this was intended from the director's side, since it gives them an eerie radiance - almost as if them being kids makes them more susceptible to the alien's communication. Never the less - it doesn't seam realistic that kids should behave like that, not even if they were brought up the way they are (by a strict reverend).(Big spoilers coming up)Considering the genre, I very much like the idea that the aliens are not portrayed as the superior beings we are used to. Instead they are portrayed as being desperate and almost weak. That itself pulls my rating up, since it helps nuance the idea of extra terrestrial life.Also the revenge motive attributed to the alien scout that Gibson mutilates, gives the visitors a more `human' touch.However: The way that Gibsons character loses his belief doesn't convince me. And the whole idea about preordained destiny I loathe. The movie implies not only that Gibson lost his wife so that he later would save his son, but also that Phoenix baseball career had the same purpose (cf. scene in military office).The way the ending plays out shows such hesitation from all involved that one doubts it's realistic. However  - considering that the alien most likely was left behind, and the terror the humans are in - maybe.That the alien has poison coming out of its arms, does not imply hunting (as for instance a snake) but rather some form of bio-bodyarmour, which we cannot see.All these weaknesses can however also be attributed to the high amount of water in the atmosphere that maybe weakens them.The way human fear is portrayed is humorous, and a good reminder of our irrational approach to things. On the same account it gives the audiance a needed breather from the heavy / horror stuff.Because of the less than creditable account of a reverends faith and the fate/destiny theme, I was constantly annoyed. From that I give 6/10.However - If you are willing to buy that stuff, its at least 7, maybe 8/10.To pull the movie down because of unrealistic aliens, is to speculate about things we can't speculate about. We don't know were they came from or why, and we don't know how our atmosphere affects them. I think this is one of Shyamalans points, and also one of the prerequisites for watching any movie.So it all comes down to belief - not aliens!",6,0,1,7 January 2003
Gangs of New York," Too long, too stereotyped, too predictable!
","Too long, too stereotyped, too predictable. Day-Lewis does a very good job, were as Dicaprio is one-dimensional (with a good portrayl of that one dimension, but its just not good enough).The cinematography is very good however, and Scorsese puts a clear fingerprint on e.g. the fighting scenes.Gangs shows very clearly that a movie can have the best director, but without the story or the actors it's all pointless. 6/10",6,0,0,9 February 2003
