Ali," Making it short and sweet
","Smith gives a terrific performance about the life and times of one Muhammad Ali (aka Cassius Clay), but the movie lacks the momentum to give the viewer any real definition as to the purpose of the film.  Certainly it's a tribute to the great boxer, but there is no entertainment value in watching the brilliance of Ali onscreen.  There is nobility in the effort the actors give in order to make the movie authentic (and it is, in spades!) but there is just no reason for you to feel connected or moved at any time during the film.I saw this movie and left the theatre feeling somewhat conflicted.  On one hand I saw a fantastic and believable performance by Smith, while on the other hand the movie lulls and goes nowhere. I simply did not enjoy this movie at all, I left the theatre feeling 5 bucks lighter and not moved a bit.",4,0,0,26 December 2001
Unbreakable," Competitive, Intriguing Filmmaking
","A controversial film detailing the makings of a real-life superhero. Inspired, inventive, and most surprising of all, it doesn't paint itself into a corner!Without the risk of sounding 'too professional', my own personal opinion is very high.  I almost never give 10's to movies I see, and when I do it is only to the most exceptional, thought-provoking pieces of work.  This movie earned a 10 in spades.  I must admit a certain bias, being a comic book collector myself, I still think that this movie contained all the elements of classic filmmaking.  It had character study, in-depth story, archetypes abound, and foreshadowing that isn't blatant (as M. Night has already shown us).This review is designed to influence as to whether or not you would want to see this movie, and if you have any doubts as to whether or not to do so, put them aside.  This movie is the epitome of great storytelling, and you will be a better man/woman for having seen it.",10,0,0,20 December 2001
Resident Evil," Who doesn't loathe zombies?
","Don't expect a whole lot of oscar winning writing here, but I found this movie to be extremely interesting. The acting is actually good from some actors and moderate on others, and some of the lines are a little hammy, but overall the movie is terrific horror film.  I found myself consistantly frightened during some points of the film, and when I wasn't, it was certainly a pleasure to watch the kinetic Milla Jovovich preform.The soundtrack was at times inappropriate.  The special effects often obvious, and there was a hint of predictability, but surprisingly (due to the fantastic direction of Paul Anderson) I still found myself jumping. 
This movie was worth my 5.50, and I think it is well worth yours.",8,0,0,16 March 2002
