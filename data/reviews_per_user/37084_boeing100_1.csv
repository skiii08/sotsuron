The Avengers," Entertainment at its finest
","After reading mixed reviews about this film, I decided to give it a try, with both Digital 3D and D-Box as add-ons. Let me say that I was certainly not disappointed! Though the storyline in itself does not bring anything new to the game, I have to say that I have not been this entertained by a movie for a long time. Firstly, the CGI was best in class. The characters, including The Hulk were lifelike and believable. I remember thinking before the movie started 'Let's see what a $200 million movie looks like' and the results are more than impressive.In regards to the 3D, YES there are some darks scenes where there is no real sense of depth, HOWEVER the final scene in NYC alone is worth paying the 3D premium for. Flying through the Manhattan skyline, dodging explosions and twist-and-turning in wrecked cars were some of many scenes that make you feel like you are actually there. This must have been helped by the D-Box chairs, which I would also recommend to make this experience complete.Finally, the actors all did a great job both in hilarious one-liners as well more emotional sequences. Overall, I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves the cinema experience for the thrills, as this title will not fail in keeping you on the edge of your seat!",9,1,4,2 May 2012
