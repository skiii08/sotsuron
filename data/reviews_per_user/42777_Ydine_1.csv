Requiem for a Dream," Incredible cutting, great story-line... Watch it twice itÂ´s superb
","When I started watching this movie I knew nothing about what so ever. But I was hooked at once because of the great cutting done in this movie. I have never seen anything like it before. It is very hard to describe the story-line in the movie, but it is about following your inner dreams no matter the cost.",9,0,0,28 May 2001
