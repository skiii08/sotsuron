Casablanca," Casablanca
","This movie has such a great story. The fact that the plot takes place during World War II is something that people in the 1940s can relate to. The verisimilitude love triangle, however, is kind of a different story. A women thinks that her husband is dead, and she ends up falling in love with another man, but then goes back to her husband after she discovers he's alive. Then she wanted to go to America with Rick, but Rick makes her stay with her husband. For the story of the movie I believe this works. I don't believe, however, it's realistic in real life. Besides the verisimilitude of the movie, there were other aspects that were great. The acting, especially on Humphrey Bogart's part, was spectacular. The lighting and the scenery was done very well. The writing and directing is what impressed me the most. Towards the end, I anticipated on what would happen, and it turns out I was totally wrong. Rick doesn't go to America, Rick shoots the German officer, the chief of police doesn't arrest Rick. This certainly surprised me in a good way. what I liked most was the theme in the end. How France and America were not going to sit back anymore and watch Germany take over. They were going to fight for their independence again.",10,1,2,18 October 2010
Citizen Kane," Citizen Kane
","I have always been told that Citizen Kane is one of the best films ever made, now I see why. This movie portrays a man who is taken away from his parents and put into a world of wealth, which lets him do basically whatever he wants. This wealth seems to make him lose everything that is important to him. His friends, his wives, and his passion for his newspaper. I believe this is why on his deathbed he said the famous word of 'Rosebud'. In the end, we all see that Rosebud is his sled he had when he was a kid. For Kane to remember this when he loses everything must mean that this was what he loved most. A time before wealth and power came to existence for him. This teaches us the theme of the movie. That being too wealthy will ruin a person and that simple moments in life, like sleigh riding, is what makes life worth it.Besides the theme, the overall movie was amazing. The audience could recognize when it was dark and when it was light due to lights in a room and shadows that appeared. Also, the camera showed many scenes at different angles. For example, when Kane was running for governor the camera was above him, so the audience was looking down at him. Also, when Kane was talking to Jed after Kane lost the election the camera looked like it was on the floor following these two men around the room. The acting was superb and Orsen Welles is a great actor as well as a great writer.",9,0,1,13 October 2010
The Grapes of Wrath," grapes of wrath
","Grapes of Wrath is a story that definitely tells the story of the Depression. Anyone can relate to this movie who have been through the Great Depression or have just had bad luck in their life. As Ma said in the movie though, no matter what they will continue fighting for a good life, which is the entire theme of the movie.The acting was done very well on every actors part. What was amazing was the photography and lighting in this movie. Though it was in black and white, some how the cinematography of the movie appeared to be so clear. Also, you could notice the use of lighting in this movie. For example, people could tell when it was night time by the darkness in the scene and the light from a candle or a flashlight. The movie did get repetitive since all the family did was move from place to place, but I would expect a story like this from John Steinbeck. Overall, a great movie with great acting and fantastic lighting and picture.",7,0,1,13 October 2010
The Graduate," the graduate
","This has to be one of my new favorite movies. This is a movie definitely good for any college student. In this movie there are many examples of diegetic and nondiegetic sounds, and on screen and off screen sounds. These types of sounds are seen together many times throughout this movie. Besides good sound, the cinematography was also impressive. I loved when Ben would go from the pool to the hotel room, from the hotel to his room, and from his room to the pool again. It was a good example of an ellipse as well. What was also impressive was the acting. I loved Dustin Hoffman's part of Ben Braddock. He pulls off the awkwardness and shyness of his character very well. The humor of his character wouldn't have been possible either without the help of good writing. The writing and dialog in this movies makes it so funny.The movie also deals with the theme of the 'generation gap'. Many times in the movie, I could see the difference between Ben and his parents. His graduation party and the swim suit for his birthday are just a few examples. Also, the theme of rebellion shows up in this movie. The ending is the most memorable one when Ben and Elaine run away together. This movie is now one of my favorites and I'm recommending it to all of my friends!",10,1,1,22 November 2010
Saboteur," saboteur
","The plot of this movie is definitely one of the best I've seen. The directing on Alfred Hitchcock's part is spectacular. The acting of Prisilla Lane and Robert Cummings was another great part of the movie that made the story of the movie believable. Although some scenes were hard to believe could be real, for example the ending scene when the real criminal falls off of the Statue of Libery, I believe that it fit the realism of the movie, but not necessarily in real life.Although it seemed that Barry Kane, the wrongfully accused protagonist of the movie, never got a break from anyone, he did get a few people to help him. For example, the blind man knew that he was running from the law, but he believed him to be a good man until proved innocent. Also, the circus people believed him to be a good man, except for the little person of the group, on a decision based on democracy.The movie did get a bit confusing when the part of who really committed the crime at the plane factory came about. Trying to understand everyones role in the plot was a little hard to follow, but I got the idea of it. Overall, the movie's plot, actors, and director all together made a good movie.",10,1,2,27 October 2010
