The Expendables 2," Sly did so well again, this time even better!
","I loved this movie so much I went back to watch it in the next showing!!!! I saw a few others walk in during the second viewing, that I could tell came from their first viewing too!!!! With that, I had to put my first ever review online! It will be short (i think!) and sweet! I read a few other reviews that go with how I feel and I want to say, yes, exactly! Great to see others see what Sly was trying to do!!!! They must have had a blast doing this movie. I wont go into details for examples so I don't spoil anything! So, in a nutshell, Sly, first of all, if it wasn't for you, the first one never would've came out either. Meaning, thank him for getting our movie heroes/action guys together and now for a second time with a few that were wanted for the first one! So, for all the fans of these guys' movies, get to the theater NOW! Secondly, this movie to me, even though I am a woman, is I believe every man's dream come true of seeing what they'd love to do if they had a chance. That is being invincible dudes, fighting against evil as a career,and having fun doing it. If anyone has issues with this movie, they need to have an attitude adjustment and get some humor in their personality!!!! Thank you Sly again for making another movie and bringing your buds with you for the journey for the second time! Your movies are pretty much all I go see now!!! Lastly, if there were special effects in this movie....where were they? Meaning, nothing looked fake! Sly and his partners did an awesome job with all the action shots. Don't know if any body doubles were used much. Everyone seems to do most or all of their own stunts, AGAIN like the first one!! OK, really, lastly. For the bad reviewers out there, I'd like to see what you can do with paying homage to our movie heroes/action guys, because it was the best and I don't know how you cant give Sly credit where credit and a good review is due!!! As Rocky would say, 'Absolutely'!",10,5,8,26 August 2012
