Blade Runner 2049," Modern Sci Fi Masterpiece
","A triumph for the modern science fiction genre and blueprint for how sequels should be made-building upon both the established and the unknown from the predecessor. Gosling, Hoeks, and Leto give incredible performances (unfortunately Ford has a relatively lackluster role), the production design is the best you'll see all year, and the cinematography explores near every aspect of the film's decayed yet technicolor landscape. Just note the slow, noir-like pacing and disturbing grittiness is far from mass-appealing.",9,2,10,14 October 2017
Your Name.," Beautifully Detailed and Enjoyable for Non-Anime Fans
","Your Name is one of the most ornate and detailed anime films I've ever watched, providing a beautifully told story of two distant yet intertwined Japanese young adults. On a few instances the plot falls into trope territory, likely to happen when you combine the stories of Freaky Friday and anime high school plots, but there's some great surprises, and an enjoyable ending and character motivations.",8,2,5,17 October 2017
Thor: Ragnarok," An Enjoyable Technicolor Superhero Flick
","Thor Ragnarok leaves the bland formula from it's first two films for an exciting and self-aware redemption story, traversing through the trash heap planet Sakaar and an Asgard under siege. Sakaar was my favorite setting out of any recent Marvel films, with Jeff Goldblum giving a hilarious performance as a playful dictator and the arena-centric atmosphere providing an intriguing set piece. Blanchett plays the best villain of the Thor trilogy, Elba's character is essentially Aragon from LOTR, and Tessa Thompson and Marc Ruffalo/Hulk are respectively well- motiaved and solid comic relief.",8,53,95,25 October 2017
BlacKkKlansman," A Throwback Film for Modern America
","I consider BlacKkKlansman an especially important message for today's political climate, where radical beliefs have began to try to bend social norms in supoort of racial discrimination. As a film, the acting is strong throughout (namely Washington, Driver, Harriet), along with the cinematography and music. My major qualms came with the film's choppy pacing and character development, rushing in certain points and dragging to a halt in others.",7,4,7,20 August 2018
Baby Driver," Best Heist Film of 2017
","Wright's latest film is both highly original and a distinct homage to heist-gone-wrong flicks. Elgort, Foxx, and Hamm nail their roles, the soundtrack's used to it's fullest potential as a great cinematography technique, and the action scenes will entice anyone itching for a standout crime movie.",8,7,12,14 October 2017
Justice League," The Cinematic Equivalent of a Loveless Marriage
","2017's Justice League is another entry in DC's desperate and rushed attempt at wrestling the superhero film genre back from Marvel. Instead of working to uniquely match the set design of Thor Ragnarok, drama of Logan, and the chemistry and combat sequences of The Avengers, Snyder & co have essentially created another Marvel ripoff. Apart from the performances of Gadot, Miller, and Fisher, the film is a slog to get through, filling scenes with nauseating action sequences and forced character chemistry. The main antagonist, Steppenwolf, is a bland ripoff from the Avengers, and the 'driving force' in the movie, the 'Mother Boxes' feel like a poorly motivated off-shot of the Infinity Stones.I'm not a Marvel or DC fanboy, I'm just trying to talk about this film as a film. The superhero genre is more saturated than ever, and you have plenty of better options than this.",4,14,26,17 November 2017
Avengers: Endgame," Really?
","Avengers: Endgame is obviously going to be a great film for Marvel superfans, but as a passive viewer it doesn't do much for me. For context, my favorite MCU film is Thor Ragnarok and I could care less about Iron Man and Captain America.The Good:
-Paul Rudd
-Mark Ruffalo
-Thor still being the best character and having his Ragnarok arc paying off further
-The 'girl power' scene, because its simultaneously a dope action sequence and is causing neckbeards to implode
-Anthony Mackie as Captain America!The Bad:
-The majority of the 2.5 hours leading up to the final battle, muddled with inconsitent tone and pacing
-even more superhero 'MacGuffins', with the only other use of the Infinity Gauntlet being to reverse the 'snap'
-The mishandling of stakes. Did anyone really seem in danger this entire film?
-Thanos' randomized power level compared to Infinity War, also felt much more formidable in that movie
-Black Widow being one of the three major deaths, ruining both a send-off for an ancient-looking Jeremy Renner and the upcoming Black Widow movie
-Captain Marvel as the film's deus-ex machina...until she isn'tAnd that's just off the top of my head. I have no interest in watching the mismanaged slog again, but I will be rewatching the Paul Rudd scenes when someone posts them to YouTube!",5,2,7,27 April 2019
Get Out," Topical Horror Done Right
","Peele's debut Get Out is a far cry from his stand up and Key and Peele days, channeling the goriness, witty plot hints, and over the top evil from classic horror flicks of the 80s. The modern racial twist is the cherry on top, being built up by incredible acting performances and music throughout.",9,11,21,14 October 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Wasted Potential from a Franchise on It's Deathbed
","Setting aside the impressive inflated-budget visuals, Pirates 5 is full of wasted potential. There's flat new characters, a lazy attempt at a Dumbledore-esque character exit, and Depp at his most unlikeable and distant than ever. SIDE RANT: Literally every moment of tension in this movie was threatening Jack Sparrow's plot armor. Need to buy the film time? Throw Sparrow's drunken stupor literal inches from the blade of a guillotine, or on the gallows, or in front of a cannon while the other characters save him. I face-palmed numerous times throughout the film.",3,0,2,14 October 2017
Coco," Excellent Return for Pixar
","After the mediocrity of The Good Dinosaur and Cars 3, Coco is an excellent return to form from Pixar, serving a respetful caricature of Mexican culture by utilizing solid voice acting, kaleidoscopic visuals and a tight musical score. The story is predictable but done in an extremely engaging matter, balancing the thin line to provide a smart story for both children and adults. By far the best animated film of 2017.",9,0,1,26 January 2018
Children of Men," One of the Best of the 2000's Decade
","One of the most depressing films in my recent watch history, Children of Men is a nonstop thrill ride throughout a socially regressive dystopian society. Owen, Moore, and Caine give outstanding performances, the set design is magnetic and aesthetically over-detailed, and the camera documents a balance of both the explosive character arcs and expansive background.",10,3,4,14 October 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Subpar (Non-Fan Perspective)
","I'm not a huge fan of the series, but I have seen all of the major films and got the references scattered throughout The Last Jedi.The film is alright. Minimal character development, enjoyable combat and dogfight sequences, and a story continually trying to tie-up it's ever expanding plot holes. The acting is fine, the dialogue not so much. Expect the Marvel trope of undercutting serious moments with 'witty' one liners and jokes.If you're a fan, you've probably seen it by now. If you're an outsider like me, check it out in IMAX for the space battles or rent it later on.",6,13,29,14 December 2017
Logan," Best Superhero Film of the Decade
","The grittiest and most fulfilling comic-book movie in years. I was thoroughly impressed by Jackman, Stewart, and Merchant's performances, the action choreography, the worthy use of a talented young actor, and plot devices that actually felt earned. Logan makes a serious example for R-Rated adaptations of beloved franchises.",8,2,6,14 October 2017
Wonder Woman," Superhero Clich√©s Ruin Another Character
","Maybe Logan has spoiled the modern superhero genre for me, but Jenkins' Wonder Woman felt like a sluggish and hollow CGI mess. While Gadot and Pine were likable enough and the visuals were at times engaging, the fight scenes, special effects, side characters, and disastrous final act leave the film feeling like a massive waste of time.",5,4,11,14 October 2017
Black Panther," Solid Origin Story Film
","Black Panther is a solid portrayal of a deep comic book character and one of the better Marvel films, utilizing exciting direction from the always proficient Ryan Coogler and pronounced acting from Boseman, B. Jordan (the best in the film by far), Nyong'o, Serkis, and Gurira. My major cons with the film included the overuse of CGI and jump-cut action, both expected staples for modern Marvel films, alongside the 2+ hour run time felt which grew tedious by the third act. Definently worth the watch before Infinity War.",7,2,8,18 February 2018
Blade Runner," The Noir and Sci Fi Worlds Collide
","Possibly the greatest blend of the noir detective and dark science fiction worlds. Scott's re-imagining of Phillip K Dick's brink-of- dystopia Earth channels a feel of both hopelessness and advancement, while Ford and Young's performances read like the futuristic cousin to Chinatown.",9,0,2,14 October 2017
Her," One of the Most Introspective & Creative Romance Films of All Time
","Phoenix and Johansson are in top form, while Jonze's unique direction counterweights hilarity with echoing loneliness. The production design of the film is an incredible mix of hipster chic and technology- dependent futuristic, engaging the viewer with a warm visual glow throughout.",10,15,20,14 October 2017
