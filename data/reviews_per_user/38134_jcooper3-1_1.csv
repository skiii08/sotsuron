United 93," excellent, moving and very, very powerful
","Much of movie appeared to try too hard to exude a feeling of the real-life situation, but all of the scenes on the plane were very well though out and very well put together. The emotion of all of passengers on the plane, as well as the terrorists was displayed brilliantly by the actors. The goodbye messages from the passenegers to their famalies were very touching and very realistically portrayed. The rest of the movie, however, was not nearly as well put together. The actors playing the rest of the roles tried vainly hard to act realistic. This aside, the movie as a whole was excellent and I would recommend it to anyone with the stomach to see it.",10,5,10,28 April 2006
