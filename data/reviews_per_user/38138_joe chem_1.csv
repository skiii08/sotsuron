The Blair Witch Project," The Real Horror of this film....
",This was a brilliant film however my viewing was hindered by an audience that thought they were watching scream or something they wouldn't stop talking and they laughed at inappropriate parts.  There are no cheap screams in this film the horror arises out of these characters descent into a hell on earth the horror is not even that they are being hunted but that they are being so manipulated (one of them cries out: 'F*** You God) the film reminded of a few of the really creepy Twilight Zone episodes (Time Enough at Last or The one where william shatner sees the monster on the airplane). The horror is not from the things that go bump in the night or the realization that their is a spook in the woods but the inexplicable notion that we are victims of some cruel inescapable cosmic or supernatural joke and no one knows or cares. The characters merely justify their horror by placing it on the witch and even themselves.  It would be an insult and misleading advertising to call this film a mere scream fest horror film.  I am still pissed off that I saw this film in a theatre filled with a bunch of immature kids whose reaction to character turmoil and pain (the real horror) is giggling (like it is supposed to be ironic or eccentric).  Save yourself the time and see this film because it is a journey into a living nightmare do not see it to scream or jump out of your seat (no one screamed the entire film).,8,0,1,5 August 1999
