The Finest Hours," Nonstop Action
","Chris Pine stays in condition for captaining a starship in the off season by captaining a Coast Guard rescue craft. There's a brief and slightly stiff opening setup of the love interest where he awkwardly asks Miriam Webber out. Holliday Grainger radiates Fifties wholesome cuteness with almost painful intensity. But then comes a really bad day where two ships simultaneously break apart in the same storm off Cape Cod. With all resources tied up on the first rescue, Pine has no choice but to take a small craft over a treacherous bar in heavy surf to deal with the second ship. Of the 41 men aboard, 32 were saved. Eight died on the bow section and one, as shown in the film, died when a wave slammed him into the ship. Casey Affleck, as Ray Sybert, plays the unpopular ship's engineer who keeps the ship functioning long enough for help to arrive. But mostly it's the sea and the unrelenting tension.",10,8,17,1 May 2016
Zootopia," Not as deep as some animated films, but great, great fun
","Some recent animated films, like How to Train Your Dragon or Inside Out, combine visual appeal and strong moral or psychological insight. Zootopia does a little, but mostly it's a great looking film with a good, complex plot and very, very, funny. The different environments are nicely realized, especially where the two heroes, small by Zootopian standards, cross over into the rodent habitat and become giants who have to avoid crushing things. If you were going to make a movie about mammals living as humans, who would you have staffing the DMV? (Remember, turtles aren't mammals) Well, Zootopia nails it, hilariously. There are homages to The Godfather and Breaking Bad. The end credits rave scene is a tour de force of animation. A total blast.",10,3,12,11 March 2016
Argo," Tense, fast moving, exciting, historically flawed.
","This is a fine film but I give it only eight stars because of its unnecessary denigration of the roles of some of our most loyal allies. With George Clooney as a producer, it's not surprising to get some of his trademark moralizing about the Middle East, although any sympathy I might have felt for Mohammed Mossadegh and the victims of SAVAK rapidly evaporated upon being reminded afresh just what the Iranian Revolution was really like. I didn't expect so much humor, but the dialogue in Hollywood as Tony Mendez tries to set up his bogus film company is often hilarious. The tension during the escape is heightened for effect: in reality there was no visit to the bazaar, no problem with tickets and no attempt to stop the flight. In the film, one of the six diplomats is an annoying, fearful twerp who becomes a hero when he talks the group through their final checkpoint. Most serious is the slander of the British and New Zealanders, who actually were helpful. The British even housed the six for a while but had them move because their location was unsafe. The Canadians were actually principally responsible for the escape and worked closely with Mendez on the cover story and furnishing documents. I can't see a single cinematic reason for those errors.",8,0,1,3 November 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," Not the Wrath of Khan
","The only other time I've seen Benedict Cumberbatch was in Amazing Grace, and there he put his icy upper class British arrogance to good use as William Pitt, working behind the scenes to end the slave trade. This time he's the villain, still icy, arrogant and British, and he lays it on with a trowel. (Hero or villain, dang, I like this guy) In the original Star Trek episode, Khan and his followers had been put in suspended animation and unwittingly revived. They tried to take over the Enterprise, were defeated, and marooned on a planet with the intent of allowing them to colonize it. In The Wrath of Khan, a Federation expedition unknowingly lands on the planet (apparently they didn't keep records very well), allowing Khan to escape again and try to resume his career of conquest.Since it takes place before the split in the Star Trek timeline, Khan's back story must remain intact. But having the villain named Khan and having him try to take over the Enterprise is about as far as the similarities go. In this version, he's revived by a war-hungry Federation admiral who's hankering to have a war with the Klingons. Khan blows up a secret Federation think tank, tries to take out the Federation High Command, and escapes to the Klingon home world. Kirk goes after him and the rest is an intricate web of scheming, double-crossing and sabotage between Kirk, Khan, and the Admiral. If you see the Wrath of Khan on DVD and then watch this film, there will be no spoilers whatsoever.For all the ferocious criticism it's gotten, Alice Eve's bra and panties scene lasts only about one second. Blink and you'd miss it. Frankly I'm amazed they were even able to get a clear frame grab to post on all the discussion sites.The first half of the film does a nice job of delineating the characters in more detail without being heavy-handed about it. The middle third has a lot of action and plot twists. The finale, where Khan crashes his ship into San Francisco, and then Spock and Khan slug it out on top of flying whatchamacallits, is a bit drawn out, not to mention clich√©d. The movie ends with Khan and his crew safely back in cryo-storage, ready to be unthawed for future villainy.I do have to mention the preposterous beginning. Kirk tries to save a primitive race from a catastrophic volcanic eruption. They do this with a 'cold fusion' device, which apparently the script writers think has something to do with refrigeration. The device freezes the lava and stops the eruption, and nobody seems to suspect that the pressures under the volcano are still building, setting the stage for an even more catastrophic eruption in the future.",8,1,2,27 June 2013
Moana," Breathtaking.
","Disney's string of heroic female leads just keeps going. And despite that unfortunate misstep with the Maui Halloween suit, work of the same sort of people who trashed 'Up' because they didn't see it leading to any marketable toys, everyone seems to like the movie. Certainly it seems to treat Polynesian traditions with deep respect. Moana is a chief's daughter in a paradise that lives by one rule, 'Don't go beyond the reef.' But her sly and subversive grandmother tells her the story of how the demigod Maui stole the heart of an island, and unleashed a great danger, and someday someone was going to have to confront Maui and return the stolen heart. She finally reveals the secret of how their ancestors came to the island. When the crops are blighted and the fish disappear, Grandmother tells Moana with her dying words to go. She finally meets Maui (Dwayne Johnson), a cynical anti-hero who has been stranded for centuries on an island because his magic fishhook has been taken, stripping him of his powers. They recover the fishhook, confront the evil that Maui unleashed, and Moana returns to an island prepared to resume voyaging again. The scenes of canoe fleets racing across the waves are exhilarating, thrilling, visually stunning, emotionally moving, and left me with a taro-size lump in my throat. The confrontation with the lava monster and its final redemption are everything you want a fairy-tale ending to be. Moana is fabulous, and Dwayne Johnson (who is of Polynesian descent) just keeps getting better. Lawrence Olivier he may never be, but he's worth the price of a ticket.",10,2,12,30 November 2016
Fast & Furious 6," Lives Up to the Title Perfectly
","It's Fast! It's Furious! It's Number 6 in the franchise! It's dumber than a box of rocks, or maybe an avalanche of rocks on speed. It's pretty much a live-action remake of Cars II. Vin Diesel and The Rock are fun to watch, but you can only take so many physically impossible car stunts and physiologically impossible fights. I picture this film being used as a cure for ADHD the way the character in A Clockwork Orange was cured of violence. 'Oh, look, something shi- Nooo! Not the London street race scene again!' Supervillain Owen Stark is collecting the components for a superweapon that can black out a whole country. Why the components are scattered instead of assembled is never made clear. The last item is a computer chip which, instead of being hidden in a desk drawer or just smashed with a hammer, is transported to a new location in a heavy carrier containing, for some reason, a tank. Stark and his baddies steal the tank and smash a lot of cars. They are captured but it can't be that easy, can it? No, it's not. They've had other henchmen take the wife of one of Vin Diesel's guys hostage. So now we have another car chase, plus a plane chase, plus boarding the plane through the loading ramp, plus three or four simultaneous fights, followed by a plane crash. Oh, look for a Jason Statham crossover next time.",6,0,1,12 June 2013
The Way Back," Why the Changes?
","When Peter Weir directs and Ed Harris is in the cast, it's a foregone conclusion the result will be pretty good. Also, we all know that changes have to be made when adapting a book to the screen. Complex events have to be simplified, minor characters and events have to be dropped, and so on. But when the changes make the film LESS compelling than the book, that's a riddle. In the book, Janusz' wife isn't tortured. Instead he's drugged into signing the confession. The month long death march to the camp site is completely missing. The deal with the commandant's wife to time the escape until her husband is away isn't in the film. In the book, nobody dies of frostbite in Siberia, and nobody turns back. Two men and the young woman die crossing the Gobi Desert, and a fourth dies within sight of India when a snow cornice gives way. Smith (Ed Harris) did not bring his son to Russia with him. I find it really hard to believe nobody in the group knew Mongolia was Communist - in the book India is the goal from the outset because that's the only place the prisoners know will be safe. All four survivors make it to India - Janusz does not take off on his own. In fact he spends a month in the hospital. This is still a very good film but I don't see how the changes improved in the least on the book. Also, while I'm perfectly aware the authenticity of the narrative has been questioned, I give literary debunkers next to zero credence. Literature as a field of study is a moribund, completely exhausted field and the only thing left for 'researchers' is tearing down others' work.",7,2,3,22 April 2012
Tangled," Best Disney Heroine Ever
","I'll never get this magic stuff. If you put a magic flower under a basket, won't it die from lack of light? And if you use it to save the queen in childbirth, why will the baby have magic powers? And why her hair? That's why I flunked out of Hogwarts. But what a fun film. Rapunzel is not just beautiful, she's seriously cute. And unlike the saintly Snow White and Cinderella, she's got a marvelous streak of spitfire in her. There's hilarious slapstick and barbed dialog. The villainess is classic Disney wicked stepmother, smarmy and selfish, whose physical beauty only serves to accentuate the evil within. She meets a most satisfying demise. The lighting of the lanterns, Rapunzel's whole motivation for leaving her tower, is breathtakingly beautiful. And on a technical note, this film got a writeup in Scientific American for advancing the frontiers of animation. Previously, extremely complicated motions of hair or clothing became rigid because the algorithms couldn't handle the complexity. The animators solved that problem. Also, a flood scene is the most lifelike CGI water I've ever seen. My only complaint, which made me consider giving the movie a 9, is that wicked stepmom has a couple of tedious musical numbers that the film could have omitted with no loss.",10,22,25,22 January 2011
Interstellar," Imagine 2001 Where All the Trippy Parts Make Sense
","Earth is dying. There's no moralizing about what we did, but a plague is destroying our crops and our atmosphere. Wheat was wiped out last year and okra is dying this year. Since my lifetime consumption of okra would barely fill a salad plate, I had a little trouble picturing that as apocalyptic. Former astronaut Cooper (McConaughey) stumbles onto a super-secret NASA facility and is recruited for a mission through a wormhole to try to find a habitable refuge for humanity. What does a wormhole look like? Well, since it looks the same from all directions, logically, a sphere. The problem is that the three potential refuge worlds all orbit a black hole, whose gravity is so intense that time slows dramatically. On the innermost, an hour on the planet equals seven years on earth, meaning the astronauts can't dawdle lest time run out for humanity on earth. As one physicist pointed out, a gravitational field that intense would probably rip any planet to bits. The inner planet is a water world with gigantic tidal waves. The explorers come back to find that 23 years have passed on earth. The next planet is an ice world inhabited by the sole survivor of a previous mission who has lost it. Cooper sends his ship and crew off but decides the answers lie within the black hole. Inside he finds a tesseract that can access any point in space and time. He realizes it was built by some vastly more advanced human civilization in the future, and uses it to send information back to his daughter, enabling her to solve the equations that will make humanity's escape possible. Cooper returns and wakes up in a colony orbiting Saturn, where he is reunited with his now-elderly daughter. This is not a very visually arresting film, indeed, it's very monochromatic. But it has a complex and non-linear plot, the tesseract is convincing, and it's a very interesting exploration of the time paradoxes of space travel and their human meaning.",10,0,3,19 December 2014
Oblivion," Cruise Control
","In some respects, Tom Cruise may be ten pounds of crazy in a five pound bag, but can he ever deliver on screen. I always check the spoiler box just to be on the safe side, although almost all the 'spoilers' I discuss are either well known or pretty obvious. For this movie, let me echo the other reviewers who say 'Don't read any spoilers!' There are a bunch of twists that I never saw coming, and one of them might be somewhat predictable but is eminently satisfying, anyway. The film deals with a two-person team (Cruise and Andrea Riseborough) assigned to operate drones that are mopping up the remnants of an alien invasion as well as guarding various machines. Things are not what they seem, which you know if you've watched any trailers, and the movie would otherwise be a live action version of 'Wall-e.' It's how things aren't what they seem that's interesting. The Earth has been devastated, buried by lava flows and sand. These are curiously scenery-conserving catastrophes. We see the Capitol and Washington Monument partly buried, but no hint of any other ruins. The Pentagon is cratered but there are no other ruins nearby. The desolation was filmed in Iceland and the film made effective use of Iceland's scenery. Ten out of ten? Probably not an immortal masterpiece, but I came away thinking I got my ticket's worth.",10,3,6,10 May 2013
Watchmen," 150 minutes of awesome, 10 minutes of lame
","Even though I hated the ending. I have to give this a 9 for the rest. The opening credits are a masterpiece. The plot is intricate and tense, Carla Gugino is Silk Specter (nothing more need be said) and Rorschach in prison ('You don't understand. I'm not locked in here with you - you're locked in here with me.') is utterly menacing. The breakout scene is dazzling. The visual effects are stunning, especially Dr. Manhattan's Fortress of Solitude (sorry, the comparison is irresistible) on Mars. Flashbacks tell the back story effectively. And then it fizzles like a balloon with a slow leak. They can generate tachyons which can travel backward in time. So why can't Dr. Manhattan time travel and prevent the catastrophe? And so the world thinks it was attacked by Dr. Manhattan and puts away all its differences and everybody joins hands and sings 'We are the world.' Uh-huh. For a couple of months max, then what? What I was really hoping was Dr. Manhattan would travel back to 1972 and switch over to our own time line. And please spare me the argument that the ending is faithful to the graphic novel. If the novel ends the same way, it's lame, regardless of its other merits.",9,2,5,26 March 2009
Man of Steel," Nice Character Work, Really Ridiculous Action
","This version of Superman is edgier that the original back in the '70's. The cast is first rate. Henry Cavill is excellent as Superman. The rest of the cast is top notch with Russel Crowe as Jor-El, Kevin Costner and Diane Lane as his terrestrial parents, Amy Adams as a perky but bold Lois Lane, Laurence Fishburne as Perry White, and Christopher Meloni as an Air Force Colonel. We see a lot more of Krypton than ever before. The head of the Krypton Council, in denial about his planet's doom, is the most absurd attempt to make something look alien ever. If you think Xerxes in 300 was weird, you haven't seen anything. We finally have something in the 'alien for alien's sake' contest more ridiculous than Jar Jar Binks. We get a wild battle scene during General Zod's rebellion, but we never really find out why he rebelled, and for that matter we never really find out why Krypton needs a military at all. The action is so frantic it's hard to follow.Clark Kent's voyage of self-discovery is very well told in flashbacks, but one weird moment is when his father dies in a tornado. He yells for people to run for an overpass, one of the worst places of refuge in a tornado, then sacrifices himself rather than have Clark reveal his powers. Unfortunately, it looks like he could easily have run for refuge himself, so, why? General Zod is sentenced to the Phantom Zone, from which he escapes when Krypton explodes. Planets don't explode, people. He hunts Clark because Jor-El had stolen the Codex, a memory bank with the DNA of all future Kryptonians. First the virus in Independence Day, now Krypton doesn't back up important files. Apparently Little Old Earth is the only civilization with basic computer savvy. And even though Kal-El (Superman) was the first natural birth on Krypton in centuries, it's hard to believe they've forgotten how to do it old school.So Zod comes to Earth demanding Superman, and Smallville is pretty much demolished by our military's futile efforts to stop Zod. Then Zod moves on Metropolis. He sets up two gravity generators on opposite sides of the earth, planning to convert Earth into Krypton and killing humanity in the process. This is pretty mysterious since there must be plenty of uninhabited planets he could transform. Zod's machines are wrecked and Zod and Superman slug it out, with each punch sending the recipient plowing up pavement or punching through buildings. Not through a wall, through five or six buildings in a row. Interestingly, gravity doesn't affect them - they travel in perfectly straight lines, which even rifle bullets don't do. Superman finally defeats Zod. He's left lying motionless, though you never kill off a top villain. Since Zod was specifically engineered for combat, you have to wonder how untrained Kal-El was able to defeat him.Clark realizes he'll need a cover that will allow him to drop out of sight on occasion and turn up in dangerous places, so he turns up, you'll never guess, as a reporter for the Daily Planet. There was no Jimmy Olsen in this film, and there shouldn't be any tension with Lois wondering whether Clark is really Superman, since when he was first developing his powers she tracked his story back to the Kent farm.",6,1,2,16 June 2013
Knowing," Good try but an impossible mission
","At an elementary school near Boston in 1959, children are asked to create drawings of the future for a time capsule to be opened in 50 years. While most create robots, rocket ships and flying cars, one intense and withdrawn little girl covers a sheet with numbers. Fifty years later Nicholas Cage's son is given the drawing. Cage, an MIT astronomer, realizes the list predicts every major disaster of the previous fifty years. There are three more events on the list. He is nearly killed in one, tries unsuccessfully to avert the other, and finally deduces that the last event predicts the death of everyone on earth.Cage's son is one of a handful of people to be saved by an alien race. But before then he has terrifying nightmares. In one he looks out his window to see the whole world on fire and animals fleeing through burning trees. I can truthfully say I never saw a flaming moose before.Cage finally figures out that the cause of the holocaust will be gigantic solar flares.You just can't pull off an ending like that successfully. If the end of the world happens and some people survive (The Stand, Independence Day), that may make for a good story. If the end happens and everyone dies, and it's our fault (Doctor Strangelove, On The Beach) it's a bummer, but also a cautionary tale. But if everyone dies, and it's not our fault, and there's nothing we can do about it, that's a guaranteed unsatisfying ending. The kids saved by the aliens don't count. They won't remember Beethoven, or the Parthenon, or the Sistine Chapel. Humans continue biologically, but not culturally.And just what is it with the Nick Cage bashing, anyhow? To hear some people talk he's the worst actor in Hollywood. Is it that he generally portrays characters who stay cool? I see enough people who behave irrationally in a crisis in real life not to want to recreate the experience in a movie.",8,1,3,5 June 2009
Captain America: Civil War," More busy than exciting
","An operation in Lagos, Nigeria to stop the theft of a virus turns deadly and there's a lot of collateral damage. As a result, the UN drafts a plan to put super-heroes under international control. Iron Man buys in, Captain America doesn't, setting the stage for the Civil War within the Avengers. First off, blaming the Avengers for the damage to New York (caused by Loki and his alien allies) and Washington (caused by Hydra) is just plain stupid, like blaming the RAF for the damage to London during the Blitz. Anyway, as the accords are about to be signed, a terrorist bomb demolishes the building where the meeting is being held. Captain America and his allies go after the villain, and Iron Man and his allies try to take them down. Because the UN would totally not care about stopping whoever tried to blow up their meeting.The bad guy is Baron (Colonel in this film) Zemo, whose family was killed in the battle with Ultron. We learn that Cap's friend Bucky was engineered by the Soviets into the Winter Soldier, and could be activated by reciting a list of code words (see AI and Telefon for other examples). There are five more just like him, stored safely in an Arctic stronghold.So there are battles with all the Marvel characters, including Ant- Man and Spider-Man. Leipzig airport gets trashed, although since the previous action took place in Berlin, I'm still puzzled how they ended up in Leipzig. Bucky gets captured, then sprung by Zemo. (Never answered, what DEactivates Bucky?) It's confusing as heck, trying to keep straight who's fighting whom, or what exactly they're fighting for.We finally end up at the Arctic stronghold where the other Winter Soldiers are stored. Zemo violates the First Rule of Movies, which is, you never, ever kill off prime villains. These people, according to Bucky, 'speak thirty languages and can take down a country overnight.' So after waiting impatiently for them to be reactivated and pose a formidable enough threat to reunite the Avengers, or at least furnish a basis for the next film, Zemo shoots them in their sleep, saying one Winter Soldier is too many. Despite seeing for himself that there really had been a threat from Zemo, Iron Man is consumed by rage upon learning that Bucky (as Winter Soldier) had killed his parents, and attacks Captain America because reasons.One person free-lancing through all this is the new character Black Panther, son of an African chief killed in the UN attack. Black Panther, a role handed down for centuries, had been his people's guardian, though I did wonder how people in Africa centuries ago made super-hero suits. Black Panther captures Zemo, proclaims that the others may be overcome by their desire for vengeance, but he is through, and prevents him from killing himself. We end up with Zemo in a cell that presents serious Eighth Amendment problems, Captain America's allies about to be sprung, and Bucky in cold storage in Black Panther's secret African lair until they can figure out how to undo his malware.Not only are the fights busy and confusing and mostly pointless, but the best element of all, having a rival, evil set of Avengers, is thrown away. Will Marvel salvage them? Maybe they also have super- healing so their brains can recover from being shot. Maybe Zemo's allies will come up with some way to clone them or fix them. Maybe there's another batch somewhere. But a conflict with these villains would be way more interesting than the set-piece battles in this film. Though I really did like Black Panther.",5,5,12,18 May 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Not a Harry Potter Copycat by any Means
","From my perspective, the Harry Potter saga peaked at Prisoner of Azkaban, then began a long slide downhill into progressively darker, drearier, and more cheerless story lines. This film has a flavor of an early Harry Potter film, where everything is still a surprise. Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) is a magical zoologist and conservation activist in the 1920's. On a visit to New York, he runs into Kowalski (Dan Fogler), a Muggle, and accidentally switches cases with him. So Scamander has to chase his escaped critters down. This brings him onto the radar of Tina (Katherine Waterston), a semi-disgraced magical police inspector. They also meet Tina's ditzy sister Queenie (Alison Sudol), who, though not exactly oversexed, is a mind reader and fully aware how men react to her. In the background, however, is a plot within the U.S. version of the Ministry of Magic. Villain Grindlewald (Johnny Depp) has assumed a false identity and is plotting to launch a war against Muggles. Grindlewald is defeated, Tina is restored to her job with honor, and though Kowalski has to be wiped of his memories, he gets a gratifyingly happy ending. Tina is an absolutely enchanting pixie of a heroine, but she doesn't do much, not so much from misogyny as because she has to chase after Newt and events at headquarters are hidden from her. And in contrast to the haunting themes of Harry Potter, the music is forgettable. But a load of fun. Oh, one last point. Some occultist complained that while Harry Potter used actual mythical beasts, the beasts in this film were 'made up.' Trust me, they're every bit as real as unicorns and griffins.",9,1,4,22 December 2016
Independence Day," Why all the pseudoscience?
","Much as I like the film from an action standpoint, I give it 7 stars for being full of just plain stupid science fiction clich√©s. An object one fifth the mass of the moon would show up from its gravitational effects long before getting anywhere close to Earth. Then it sheds a fleet of ships 15 miles in diameter that station themselves over major world cities. Ships that huge would be almost impossible for anything short of a nuclear weapon to damage, plus big enough to house fleets bigger than any nation's air force. But no, they have to have shields, too. Then it turns out the aliens have - you'll never see this coming - telepathy, too. In desperation, the President orders a nuclear strike. A ship 15 miles in diameter and a mile thick would suffer a hole maybe a couple of miles across. Something that, on the scale of that ship, would just buff out. But, no, the shield protects the ship. It's not like they'd be likely to have a defense system capable of shooting down any incoming weapon. And of course, there's something big and secret at Area 51, where we have an alien ship under study. I'm surprised they didn't work in the Bermuda Triangle and the Maya calendar. Meanwhile, the First Lady has been fatally injured and turns up at Area 51 to say good-bye. Ridiculous. There's this huge underground lab with all sorts of equipment, and not a single person with any medical training? Not even someone with combat medic training? She's dying. Operate, already. She can't end up any more dead than if you just sit there and do nothing.When the mother ship popped into town, the captive ship at Area 51 turned on, to the joy of everyone because 'we couldn't replicate their power source.' So then Jeff Goldblum decides to fly it by hooking up a terrestrial laptop. So if the alien ship used unknown power, how did the terrestrial PC communicate? Because terrestrial computers use ordinary electricity to send signals. The much ridiculed assumption that the aliens lack firewalls and computer protection pales into insignificance against our not being able to start up the alien systems when they can obviously use electricity.Oh, spoiler alert, we don't all die.",7,0,0,1 June 2016
Avengers: Infinity War," Man, That's Quite a Corner You've Written Yourself Into
","The Big Bang created six stones that each govern aspects of the universe. Somebody wanna 'splain me why they aren't scattered in galaxies billions of light years apart, maybe in the cores of planets, instead of being in one small region of space where they can all be collected? So Thanos, mastermind of the previous attack on New York, has a theory that saving the universe means bringing it back within its carrying capacity by killing half the sentient life forms on every world. So he sends his minions to earth to collect the stones he's still missing. To combat them, all the various Marvel characters come together, and it is indeed great fun to see them. There's a climactic battle in Wakanda, where Thanos completes his quest and people, including some Marvel folk, begin disintegrating, presumably because Thanos can now will their disappearance. We see Thanos sitting under an alien moon, and given the reassurance that he will return. Okay, where do they go from here? Just imagine the chaos if half the human race vanishes. It'll make the 'Left Behind' scenario look mild in comparison. What will Thanos do for an encore? He already has the Infinity Gauntlet. And do they fight Thanos with magic and psychic powers? No, plain old 'Biff' 'Pow' mechanical force. Stuff that the military does quite capably. So wouldn't a few F-35's help a little bit? Wouldn't a few gunships help with that attacking horde at Wakanda? So a lot of very fun stuff that fizzles out into yet another chaotic mass melee and a profoundly disappointing ending.",7,1,1,29 May 2018
Frozen," Visually stunning, funny, satisfying
","Cinderella and Snow White got the gold watches and a nice retirement party. The era of spunky, take-no-prisoners Disney heroines is upon us, and it is good. There are only so many ways to shuffle the elements of a fairy tale, and they've all been done, so if you're expecting anything radically new from any fairy tale, well, tough luck. That's the limitations of the genre, not the film.The film opens with a haunting chant that sounds more Polynesian or native American than anything else, then a striking scene of ice harvesters cutting ice in the winter. The only thing quite like it is the circus roustabouts in 'Dumbo' erecting tents. Visually and musically, it's one of the best things in the film. I'd like to have seen more things in this style. We get introduced to Kristoff, the hero, as a youngster trying to keep up with the grown-ups.The kingdom of Arendelle has two princesses, Elsa and Anna. Elsa is cursed with the power of freezing things and becomes a recluse, until the day of her coronation, when she panics and locks the kingdom in perpetual winter, then flees into the mountains. It's up to Anna to rescue her. The film has the predictable musical numbers, but they're better integrated with the story than say, the tedious 'Mother knows best' in 'Tangled,' and more appealing. Still, I'd like to see a return to singable tunes that can really stand alone. 'The first time in forever' is straight out of the 'I did it my way' cocktail lounge genre.Visually, it's wonderful. Gorgeous scenery, Elsa's ice palace, cute trolls. There's plenty of humor and a plot twist where a seeming hero turns out to be a villain.",10,2,10,14 January 2014
Coco," Spectacular, but one serious flaw.
","Considering how easy it can be these days to run afoul of cultural sensibilities, the universal praise heaped on this film is amazing. Some Mexican friends of ours saw it and were lavish in their praise. Miguel is a music-loving boy in perhaps the only family in Mexico that hates music. His great-great -grandfather left the family to pursue a career as a musician, and to make ends meet, his wife took to making shoes, and banished all music from the home. Miguel wants to enter the music contest for the Day of the Dead but his hopes are dashed, literally, when his grandmother smashes his homemade guitar. And this is why I give this a 9 rather than a 10. She's an utterly despicable, mean-spirited witch, and the rest of the family is too cowardly to stand up to her. At the end of the film she sheds a tear, a perfect example of what I call a Nazi With A Puppy Dog Moment, where a repugnant character gets a token humanizing moment.In desperation, Manuel 'borrows' the guitar from the shrine to the most famous musician in the town's history, and in so doing he ends up crossing over to the Land of the Dead. Wow, is this a dazzling film. The color and intricacy of the Land of the Dead is beyond amazing.

Lincoln," Spielberg Just Doesn't Know How to End a Movie
","I often say Tchaikovsky wrote 'how the hell do I land this thing?' symphonies. The final notes sound, then, nope, a long coda that finally sputters out from exhaustion. Spielberg makes movies that way. Schindler's list concluded with the surviving Schindler Jews placing memorials on Schindler's grave. Okay, that was kind of neat. In AI, the robot boy finds the Blue Fairy and gazes at her until his batteries run out. Fade to black. Perfect. A very 2001 enigmatic ending. Nope. We get another 15 minutes of him being revived in the distant future. In Lincoln, we see him walking out the door on the way to Ford's Theater. Fade to black. Cut! CUT! Oh no, nononoNONO. We know he got shot! Why tack it on to the end? Just fade from him walking out the door into his second inaugural speech. Why does he feel he has to tack a superfluous ending onto his movies? It's good. Daniel Day Lewis owns the role now. Tommy Lee Jones is dryly humorous as abolitionist activist Thaddeus Stevens. He spends the whole film in a wig that would embarrass Donald Trump, then when we see him last, we find out why he wears it. The plot deals with the maneuvering to get the Thirteenth Amendment banning slavery through Congress. But it has about as much punch as the vote to fund a new dam or declare a day honoring whatever. The pro-slavery characters are portrayed as slimy, but they might as well be crooked car dealers. The film needs something more to drive home the horror of slavery and the moral imperative for ending it.",8,3,8,27 November 2012
Brave," Visually Gorgeous, Nice Score, Thin Plot
","Let's see. Royal family, check. Uptight but good-hearted queen and mother, check. Arranged marriage, check. Icky choice of suitors, check. Rebellious daughter, check. Magic spell with unintended consequences (like there's any other kind), check. Desperate race to undo spell, check. Even more desperate battle to prevent a fatal misunderstanding, check. Liberating finale, check. Kid from Brooklyn who's too young to die, check - sorry, wrong movie. Not only is the story line pretty predictable, but by today's standards, very linear. No back story, no subplots to speak of. Many of the scenery shots are absolutely exquisite - the visual artistry in animation just keeps getting better. The score is evocative. There are some great slapstick and tender scenes. Spoiler - the spell turns people into bears. I seriously flashed back to Brother Bear in a couple of places. And when the queen, who had been covered only in fur, changes back, it is undoubtedly the first time a female in a Pixar film has ever said 'I'm naked.' There's plenty here to justify the ticket, but it is a bit thin in the plot.",7,1,1,21 July 2012
Clash of the Titans," Release the Kraken!
","When I tell my classes about constellations, I tell the Andromeda myth, since much of the autumn evening sky is filled with constellations from this myth - even the Kraken (the constellation Cetus). So it was amusing that I had just told a class the story before seeing the movie. To say the movie is loosely based on the myth is being generous. Jake Sully, sorry, Sam Worthington, is Perseus, but he's indistinguishable from Jake Sully, even down to the Marine haircut. One character not in the Perseus myth is Io (Gemma Arterton). Io was one of Jupiter's lovers and is commemorated as a satellite of Jupiter. So Gemma Arterton is a heavenly body? No argument here. She's a feast for the eyes in this film. Visuals are impressive and the action is exciting. Andromeda is dignified, brave, and beautiful, even if she doesn't get the hero in the end (unlike the actual myth). As for the 3-D, I avoided Avatar for fear of eyestrain and headaches, but tried it here. I had no problems, but I have a very dominant left eye and, apart from a few exaggerated effects in the trailers, the 3-D had no effect at all on my eyes.",7,0,1,8 May 2010
Jurassic World," A decent monster movie
","We know they can clone dinosaurs, so we don't have the element of wonder from the first film. What we do have are some of the stupidest 'scientific' criticisms ever made. 'The dinosaurs are still shown with leathery skin instead of feathered.' Well, we know some small dinosaurs were feathered, but we have no evidence on the larger ones. Whales, elephants and hippos are all mammals and theoretically have hair, but not to a casual observer. 'The dinosaurs are drab colors.' But so are most birds, to the point where an ornithologist friend of mine referred to many as 'LBJ's' - 'Little Brown Jobs.' They're either trying to prey on something or avoid being prey, and camouflage helps.Jurassic World's numbers are going flat, so the suits decide on a new and scarier dino, a hybrid of T-Rex, raptor and other things. And it's clever enough to dig out its tracking device and escape. And while it effectively destroys the security teams sent in to get it, most of the carnage in the park itself is done by flying reptiles that escape from their dome. The jury is still out on whether they had powered flight at all, and they certainly could not have carried a human, let alone the baby dino we see being lifted at one point.And of course they have corporate bad guys. This is something of a Law and Order reunion, with Vincent D'Onofrio (the mild mannered stammering detective) as a creep with a scheme to weaponize raptors, and B.D. Wong (the prosecutor) as an amoral geneticist. D'Onofrio's demise is entirely predictable but still satisfying. Gee, a corporation shown as evil in a movie - once again. So much for 'speaking truth to power.'",8,4,16,24 June 2015
The Dark Knight," Okay but overrated
","This film is more fun than Star Wars, more thrilling than Indiana Jones, more morally insightful than Gandhi, more heartwarming than It's A Wonderful Life....That's all to placate the folks who get furious at anything but paeans of adulation for this film.First of all, I'm sick to death of movies where the bad guy gets free by holding a human shield. With cops five feet away aiming at his head and the hostage yelling 'Take the shot.' Isn't that what they have firing ranges for? So you can learn to aim a gun? These clowns deserved to get themselves blown up. It's the stupidest clich√© in film - Enough, Already! And this film is l-o-o-n-g. I was looking at my watch thinking 'They haven't even gotten to the ferryboat scene yet?' Harvey Dent knows Gotham is full of evil. He charges 500+ gangsters on one RICO charge. Yet, when his girl friend is killed by the same criminals, he blames the person who saved him instead of the criminals, and does a total 180. Just not believable.Bringing down the World Trade Center would have been a piece of cake compared to all the explosives the Joker installs. How do you put a bomb in every nook and cranny of a hospital without anyone noticing?The people who see deep moral issues in this film must be fascinated by blinking lights and totally perplexed by paper clips. The Joker gets as far as he does precisely because the good guys fail to take action. And I'm sorry, but I just don't see Bruce Wayne's use of cell phones to track the Joker as morally problematic. I would definitely not want that technology to fall into certain hands, but wrong? How? Now the good parts. Give Ledger his posthumous Oscar - he's loathsome, which means he's great. The action is intense and well orchestrated. The greatest hero in the movie is a convict on one of the endangered ferryboats who gives us a moment of pure nobility. It makes for an exciting evening, but not greatness.",7,3,9,26 August 2008
How to Train Your Dragon," Short and Sweet
","Everything in this charming morality tale has been done before. The hero learns to question his most deeply ingrained assumptions, overcomes opposition and changes everything. But it's visually spectacular, has some laugh out loud moments as well as some genuinely moving scenes, and a brisk pace that never bogs down. A medieval settlement is plagued by dragon attacks, but instead of being stock European serfs who flee from danger and wait for a knight to save them, these villagers are Vikings who fight back pretty much on equal terms. Interestingly, the elder Vikings have accents that sound more Scottish than Scandinavian, although I do confess I've never actually heard a real Viking talk. Hiccup, the embarrassing son of the rowdiest Viking of them all, befriends a dragon, learns the secrets of dragons and why they raid his village, and finally leads an attack that saves his father, the other Vikings, and the dragons themselves. One of the prize moments in the film comes when Hiccup's father sees his son riding a dragon to the rescue and soundlessly mouths 'what the ---?' The aerial scenes are beautiful and thrilling. Great, great fun.",10,2,3,8 August 2010
The Secret Life of Pets," New York is Beautiful, a Few Funny Moments, but Overall, Meh
","New York has never been more spectacular and has fall colors New England would die for. And there are a few funny moments, the best being from the trailer where Leonard, the pampered French poodle, turns into a hard rock fiend once his owner leaves. Max's idyllic life with his owner Katie is turned upside down when she brings home a giant shaggy mutt named Duke. Max tries to shake Duke, and they both end up fleeing the pound and falling in with a bunch of vengeful abandoned pets. Meanwhile all the other pets from Max's building join forces to find them. There are wild chase scenes that are more chaotic than exciting, and none of the animal characters are particularly visually appealing. I was fascinated to find out New York has only two dog catchers and they cover both Manhattan and Brooklyn.",5,2,12,14 July 2016
Finding Dory," Not Quite up to Finding Nemo But Lots of Fun
","A fun sequel to Finding Nemo that somehow treats California and Australia as close together. Dory's attempt to locate her dimly remembered family lands her in a marine aquarium in California. Much of the undersea action takes place in deeper and murkier waters than Finding Nemo, so the visual appeal isn't quite up to the original film. The high point of this film is an octopus named Hank whose ability to camouflage himself and squeeze through tiny openings is exploited to the max. Also Hank has the wise- cracking ability of his voice actor, Ed O'Neill (AKA Al Bundy). Dory is about to be shipped to an aquarium in Cleveland, but she and Hank hijack the truck in a hilarious escape sequence. Eventually Dory meets her parents, though the meeting isn't as heartwarming as it could have been and just seems a bit flat. As is the custom these days, viewers are encouraged to stay through the end credits by the promise of humorous interludes. Do stay. There's a great tie-back to the original film at the very end.",8,1,7,7 July 2016
Arrival," This will not be easy
","The always agreeable Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner are two scientists tasked with communicating with the inhabitants of mysterious ships that suddenly appeared over the earth. No shoot-em-ups or explosions (except one). The aliens are seriously alien looking and have a symbolic written language which Adams slowly deciphers. The film mostly deals with the painfully slow process of sorting the alien language out. Meanwhile the rest of the earth freaks out. The U.S. is blessed with the usual crop of conspiracy bloggers, while Russia and China start to get itchy trigger fingers. The way Adams defuses the global crisis involves a mind-warping temporal loop, and would make a great and emotionally satisfying ending. Unfortunately, there's a sappy coda tacked on that contributes nothing and seriously detracts from the emotional impact of the film. We step back from the brink of interstellar war, humanity's better impulses win by a razor thin margin, the aliens leave in peace, leaving their language, which may hold the key to radically new concepts, and instead of ending on a hopeful and triumphant note, the film makers resort to an ending with the emotional impact of a damp sponge.",8,5,10,13 December 2016
Wonder Woman," Great in so many ways but terribly chiched ending
","The film opens with a hint of a superhero crossover, as a courier from Wayne Enterprises delivers a package to Diana Prince, containing a century old photograph. The photograph sets her off on a reverie of her childhood on the hidden island of Themyscira, which ends when a plane piloted by Steve Trevor crashes through their shield followed soon after by a German gunboat. The Amazons kill the Germans but several Amazons are killed, including their beloved general. Trevor tells them of World War I raging outside. So the first question is, if a stray plane and gunboat can discover them, why weren't they repeatedly discovered by stray ships many times before? In response to his question as to how she speaks English, Diana tells Steve that they speak hundreds of languages. So how can they know hundreds of modern languages and yet be unaware of World War I? Diana decides she must leave to help end the slaughter. They set out in a small boat and when they wake up at dawn, they're in London. How did they get from a presumably Greek island to London in a single night?The historical nexus is well chosen. A fanatical German general and a mad scientist are plotting to unleash a super gas against the Allies on the eve of the Armistice, to prolong the war and ultimately win it for Germany. Trevor, Diana, and a few of Trevor's seedy friends decide to infiltrate behind German lines and stop the Germans. Diana's astonishment and horror at the effects of modern war are moving and wonderfully acted out, and the scene where she leads a charge across No- Man's Land to rescue a village would be utterly absurd if it weren't so thrilling and inspiring.Diana believes the plot is master-minded by the god Ares, who rebelled against Zeus in anger over the creation of mankind. In due course they infiltrate the German base, Steve hijacks the German plane full of gas bombs and pilots it to his inevitable heroic death. Diana and Ares have it out. Ares explains to Diana that he merely plants suggestions in people's minds, but that humans cause wars all by themselves. So Diana and Ares slam into each other, each flinging the other hundreds of yards, landing hard enough to shatter pavement. Didn't Superman and Zod do that in 'Man of Steel?' They each hurl lightning bolts at each other, so very Palpatine and Darth Vader. The utter unoriginality and physical absurdity of this climactic fight detracts sadly from the film.So at the end we understand the photograph. It shows her, Steve Trevor and his motley crew just after they liberate the village. She types an e-mail to Bruce Wayne, thanking him. Then we see her on a high perch above modern London, aware that her mission is far more complicated than she ever imagined.",8,4,10,15 June 2017
Black Panther," I Probably Expected Too Much
","When I saw Black Panther in 'Civil War,' I seriously hoped he'd appear again, and when I heard they were making a film about him, I was thrilled. The glowing reviews added to my excitement. The pluses are that the villain has a rational reason to want revenge, and he wants to stop the oppression of black people. (Sure, he wants to trigger a global race war, but nobody's perfect.) So the plot revolves around real-world issues, not some abstract Nyah-hah-hah take-over-the-world scheme. But the basic premise is preposterous, that you can hide a nation more technically advanced than anyone else behind an invisibility cloak. Where does Wakanda get all its scientific and technological expertise? If students go abroad, doesn't anyone wonder why there are all these exchange students from a dirt-poor country, or what happens to them? And even if Wakanda can cloak itself now, how did it keep its first steam engines secret? And the finale involves a chaotic set-piece battle royale like in 'Civil War,' again with nobody appearing even to get a skinned knee. Finally, I think they missed an opportunity by killing off Killmonger. In his final scene, he looked like he might be open to redemption. They could have done a lot with him as a flawed but slowly maturing hero.",8,1,6,5 March 2018
Iron Man," Great Job. More of the same on the way.
","I'm not a comic book aficionado, so I judge movies like this on whether they deliver a good story. I was especially struck by the good reviews given the performances. The reviews were right on.Even before his captivity, Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) comes across as interesting despite his gazillion bucks. He jokes and schmoozes with the troops in his convoy. He bonds with his fellow captive. So it's believable that he comes out of the experience changed.Gwyneth Paltrow is perfect as his Girl Friday, exuding a perfect mix of loyalty, competence, bemused contempt at her boss's hedonism and sardonic humor. The red hair is a nice touch. And that name! Pepper Potts! I have to go back to Goldfinger and Pussy Galore to find a name that perfect.There are some marvelous comic scenes as Stark tries to work the bugs out of his super-suit and trades barbs with his AI robots.I do concur with the folks who thought a battle with a malevolent robot was a bit of an anti-climax after single handedly liberating a village. Thus the 9 instead of a 10.Rarely have I seen a film with so many things protruding from the ending plainly labeled 'attach sequel here.' Stark and Potts have a thing for each other but they still hesitate. Rhodie will get a suit of his own. SHIELD will have missions for Stark. And reporter Christine Everhart (Leslie Bibb) is plainly interested in Stark. Some commentators felt Bibb was underutilized in the role. Fear not. We have not seen the last of the yummy Ms. Bibb.",9,1,2,13 May 2008
Cloud Atlas," I have no idea what I just saw but it's phenomenal
","You can hardly talk about this film without giving spoilers. If you ever had any doubts about Tom Hanks as a superlative and versatile actor, this film will settle it. Watch the ending credits to see who played what because it will blow you away. Hugo Weaving does what he does best. As everyone who's read reviews knows by now, the film involves six interlaced stories from the mid-19th century to several centuries in the future. The stories are linked very lightly. There's no ham-handed reference in one story to a previous or future story line. At most there are hints. A journal and letters from one story turn up later, and so on. The pace is vigorous, and the stories, though not tightly linked, flow smoothly from one to the other; the action in one makes sense in view of what just happened in another, and so on. Even thinking about trying to keep this straight makes my head hurt. There's action, good special effects, and richly satisfying conclusions to most of the stories, but not uniformly happy. Unlike Roger Ebert, I don't want to see this film again. It would ruin the experience of watching it unfold for the first time.",10,9,16,30 October 2012
300," Okay, not great but not terrible
","This is a movie version of a graphic novel version of the Battle of Thermopylae, where 300 Spartans held off a vastly superior Persian army. You don't go to something like this expecting accurate history or geography. Anyone not literate enough to understand this is a highly stylized retelling should do other movie-goers a favor and stay home. And the only way you can come out of this film seeing it as a metaphor for the present Middle East or the War on Terror is to go in already determined to see it that way. As any number of historically informed reviewers have noted, most of the most jingoistic and 'rah-rah' scenes in the film are quoted directly from the ancient Greeks who wrote about the battle.There's tons of action but not much suspense; we know the Titanic will sink and we know the Spartans will be betrayed and overwhelmed. Some of the visuals are unintentionally hilarious. The old priests visited by Leonidas at the start of the film look for all the world like Emperor Palpatine and Xerxes looks so much like one of the Borg I all but expected him to say 'Resistance is futile. You will be assimilated.' And apparently Xerxes had a personal bodyguard of ninjas.Anatomical discovery of the day: hack off an arm or stab someone in the gut, and blood sprays everywhere. Hack off a head, sever the carotids and the jugulars, and it barely drips.Even allowing for the stylized story, the historical inaccuracies grate after a while. What's missing more than anything else is why we should care. Persia, to be sure, was an autocratic empire but Sparta was as regimented as North Korea. If North Korea were to duke it out with Iran I'd make a big bowl of popcorn and cheer for both sides as I watched it on TV. Also, the Persian rulers Cyrus, Darius and Xerxes, all mentioned in the Bible, were competent and fairly enlightened rulers. We can be certain Xerxes was not the hermaphroditic freak he's made out to be in this film. Why did the Persians try to conquer Greece in the first place? How could people in Sparta, which was both ultra-militaristic and brutal in its treatment of its children and its slaves, talk about freedom? Obviously 'freedom' meant something to them, but what? Why would they identify with other Greeks instead of accepting the Persian offer of overlord-ship? Why would other Greeks identify with the Spartans? Obviously there were complex motivations and modes of thinking that cut across our categories, and the film makes no effort to explore them.The closing credit graphics are colorful, dramatic, and worth staying for.",6,0,2,14 April 2007
The Martian," Because I don't have eleven stars
","This film lived up nicely to all the pre-release hype. Matt Damon is stranded on Mars when he's blown away by a Martian windstorm and presumed dead, and the expedition has to abort the mission. But he survived, and fixes his injuries, grows potatoes originally intended as a Thanksgiving treat, burns thruster fuel to create water, uses human wastes as fertilizer (for some reason, only his own) and recovers an old Mars lander to improvise communications with Earth. There are a few scientific quibbles. Martian windstorms are just not that powerful since the air is only 1/1000 as dense as earth's. It seems unlikely that the habitat wouldn't have its own communications with Earth, or at least the ability to communicate through the fleet of satellites orbiting Mars. And the ending piles on problems simply for the sake of piling them on. Really, instead of blowing off one end of the rescue ship to generate thrust to slow down, why not just turn and use the thrusters? That way the whole ship is habitable for the return trip instead of just a few cut-off modules. Matt Damon certainly delivers an effective recruiting pitch for NASA, though Jessica Chastain 'swimming' in zero-g gives him worthy competition. At a time when many people don't consider characters interesting unless they manifest at least half the conditions in DSM-V, some unapologetic rational behavior is a breath of fresh air. Competence porn? Bring it on.",10,6,14,21 October 2015
