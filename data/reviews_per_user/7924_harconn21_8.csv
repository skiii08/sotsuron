Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Funniest of the lot!
","I absolutely love the POTC franchise because more than any other movies series, I've seen it makes me laugh. A lot. I own the first three and recently went to see this one. I laughed until I cried throughout most of the movie because of Jack Sparrow, of course. The writers are just brilliant. I loved Captain Teague's line 'Does this face look like it's been to the Fountain of Youth?' and really liked Jack's line after the mutiny: 'I can name fingers and point names.' It may not make sense to some, but that is just typical Jack, wonderfully portrayed by Depp. I think Depp is perfect as Sparrow; honestly and - I think other fans will agree - the franchise wouldn't have been anywhere near as successful as it's been if Depp wasn't a part of it. If the production team can keep up the good work, I'd say let's have two more, and make it two trilogies.",Null,0,1,4 August 2011
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Mud's Clearer Than This!
","OK, the only thing interesting about this first part is the wedding. The shots were nicely done, and the dress was too, but other than that, there was no life to Breaking Dawn pt 1.Makeup was nicely done during Bella's pregnancy though.I'm glad I went through my teenage years during Harry Potter, because that series is much more interesting - and with both the books and movies - more profitable.Since first coming across Meyer's books when they first came out, I've always been of the opinion that she was simply riding Rowling's coat tails in a sense, trying to be as successful but with crappy material. I never read the books, but the movies speak for them as to how bad they are.",1,8,10,2 November 2014
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Holy Crap!
","I'm a big HP fan; I have the books and I've seen all the movies, but I think this one was the worst of the lot so far. It's one thing to make a movie out of a book, but when you have Rowling material, don't chop it up! The first two movies were good, but beginning with the third, it's like the filmmakers just weren't into it; things began going down drain from there, and each installment kept getting a little bit worse.With DH P1 in particular, I found that no matter how loud I put my TV, it was often hard to hear the dialogue and most of the time, the music was too loud. Words were mumbled and certain lines just came out sounding wrong.I cringed when it came to the Ministry scenes: I mean really, you'd think the way Harry's Runcorn was moving, he was dead, he was so stiff! What was David O'Hara thinking? Another thing that's annoyed me about movies three through seven is that the right dialogue is said, but the setting is wrong. They did that a bit in the first two, but it wasn't as noticeable.Things in DH P1 jumped around a lot, it was really choppy and there was very little transitional flow. For those of us who haven't read the last book in awhile, it was quite disconcerting. And really, I think only Radcliffe, Watson and Grint should have gotten star billing on Wikipedia, because Snape's scene(s) in the final cut amounted to little more than a cameo, and yet Alan Rickman got star billing.Overall, comparing all the movies so far, this one was the worst. When HBP came out, I almost didn't want to watch it because I was afraid of the horrors I would see. The only reason I did was because Rowling is such a great writer.I don't know what to expect for P2 but I'm thinking it could almost be as bad as P1; they were shot at the same time after all. There really wasn't anything good about P1. I actually considered turning it off. I was really, really disappointed. I could't believe that such a good production team could pull off such horrible work. Hell, I've seen kid's stuff that was better! It really was a let down.I don't usually like to give material of Rowling's caliber such a low ranking (2) but unfortunately, Deathly Hallows deserved it. Maybe it's because I'm a writer that I'm picky about this sort of material. We'll see what P2 is like. Cheers!",2,3,4,14 May 2011
Twilight," Skunk Spray Smells Better . . .
","OK, no offence to people who actually like the series, but to me, Twilight and the others in the series should never have been made. I wish I didn't have to fill ten lines, because given a choice, I could happily express my sentiments in five words.Honestly, there is nothing remotely interesting about this movie at all. I've never read the book series – and don't intend to – and only watched Twilight because of the fuss surrounding it. I'm neither a fan of first person literary narrative or fantasy per se, and I put up a big stink when my sister persuaded me to read Philosopher's Stone; it turned out to be a much better experience than this!Look at it this way: the novels aside, when the lowest grossing Harry Potter movie makes millions more at the box office than the highest grossing Twilight film, what does that tell you?PUT TWILIGHT IN THE GARBAGE!",1,3,6,2 November 2014
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Bad Bad Bad!
","What can I say? More of the same boring, flat garbage as before . . . with wolves, and I use the term with all due sarcasm. The mere fact that there are were wolves 'man wolves' in this series, is only a wee bit interesting. Everything else is stupid.Much like with Twilight, New Moon is not worth viewing in my book. In fact, the entire series as a whole is a bit creepy . . .Anyway, I sound like a broken record. Blah blah blah.Why did I see this again? If I wanted an angst fest, I would have read a fan fiction. At least some authors can make fan fiction interesting.Meyer should never have sold the rights.This can go in the garbage too.",1,6,7,2 November 2014
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Yay, No More Crap!
","I'd really rather not give this a rating of 1 star, would it be possible for IMDb to put in a zero rating, because this movie doesn't even deserve the 1.Anyway, I s'pose if I have to pick out something of interest here, it would have to be Mackenzie Foy as Nessie, at least she brought something fresh - however squashed it ended up being - to the finale.I'm really glad there won't be anymore Twilight movies. If they ever decide to make a film adaption of Meyer's Midnight Sun - Twilight all over again from the vamp's POV : BORING! - I won't bother with it.Overall, I feel sorry in a way for the people involved in this series and for those who've read the books because honestly, it's really hard to get attached to/be interested in characters that have no substance; if you're going to put a character on the page, screen etc, at least make them interesting! Everyone involved in the series did the best they could, but the Twilight series is finished!How bad is the Twilight Saga? Even legendary writer Stephen King doesn't like it!",1,15,38,2 November 2014
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," I've Said It Once, I'll Say It Again . . . HOLY CRAP!
","HP DH P2 gets the same rating as P1 because it too, lacked punch; it needed umph to be interesting and it just wasn't. In fact, I can sum up Pts 1 and 2 in about three words: dull, lifeless and flat! The movie was too slow, and it needed speed or something because for most of it, it felt like you were slogging through muddied molasses. I'll admit that it was interesting to see the trio as adults, but could the finale get any more awkward? And Voldemort's death? Oh please, about as anti-climatic as you can get. He just seemed to turn into ashes and float away! I'm sorry to say this but the last two movies were as Razzie as you can get. Overall, the two parts may have grossed over several billion, but in my book, it wasn't worth the twelve bucks to go see them; viewers should have paid less than half that. At least I - and many others - won't be tortured anymore by any more chopped up crap. If like me, you love the Potter series, for God's sake, stick to the books, they last longer!",Null,0,0,12 August 2011
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Burn It!
","I'm running out of expletives and bad things to say!Anyway, if the Twilight Saga was a carousel, it would never stop hitting people over the head!There was a bit of drama - if you could call it that - during the final part of the movie, but it was just further confirmation that there is no substance to this movie either.It's pretty bad when a movie like this is spurned by other media, and even in other movies! Guess it's a mark as to how bad it is.Toss Eclipse out the window and hope it lands on the moon.May it never see the light of day again.",1,3,6,2 November 2014
