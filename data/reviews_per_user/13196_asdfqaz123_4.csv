The Avengers," 2 hrs and 23 mins of fluffs
","For those of you who are looking for more than just action sequences, this is going to be a very long film for you; my advice is: visit the restroom as often as you'd like, don't torture yourself.Take away the very predictable first 45 minutes of team assembly and the final 45 minutes of predictable one-sided mano-a-mano, there's still 50 minutes in the middle to put together a decent story. But when all is said and done, you'll find it's impossible to describe what the movie was really about. After all, no one ever promised it's a movie about anything.Worry not though, no one is ever going to ask you about the storyline. Your sole responsibility is to remember the details of the special effects e.g. how the smoke coming out of a broken rotating blade is sucked back into it. Abandoning that, and you've just wasted a good chunk of your life.So, choose wisely. If you're like me who can think of a million other ways to spend 2.5 hours of weekend time, you probably should choose one of those instead.",3,8,31,13 May 2012
Knives Out," Watching this is truly as painful as pulling knives out
","Why the hype? I have no idea. Fortunately I had one advantage over the audience at the theaters: fast forward. It was so painfully slow throughout, by the middle of the movie, I was thinking this is either gonna end like the usual suspect or dumb and dumber. It became clear after the lawyer read the will. I mean, think about it, even before the sweet and caring Marta can gain control of the assets, she has to clear a lot of hurdles. The family members can file for a court injunction, sue her for wrongful death, undue influence and theft. If she's really lucky, she wins every legal battle and gets to run a small company, but does she understand corporate accounting and intellectual property laws? If she's less lucky, she gets to settle all the lawsuits by selling or giving away all the assets to the circling sharks. If she's out of luck, she'll be incarcerated and tried for murder. The old Thrombey had basically put Marta in a living hell. If I were her, I'd give up all the assets in exchange for not pressing charges and move to Uruguay and live a normal life.",1,6,13,15 March 2020
Parasite," What's the hype?
","I don't understand the hype surrounding this movie. First, similar subjects have been covered many times before, e.g. 'Shattered glass', 'Catch me if you can', 'Bling ring'. Second, this film isn't particularly educational or anywhere near a real event. Third, this film doesn't even stand out among Korean films, the acting, cinematography, scripts are good but not great. I'm sure most people would have no recollection of this film in a few years because it's a movie about ... nothing.",2,14,39,9 February 2020
Flight," A great movie, but ...
","A great movie, riveting from the first scene to well, the last 15 minutes or so.The biggest let down for me was the typical Hollywood, politically correct ending, which in my opinion is very unnecessary and counter intuitive. Had the movie ended on the moment captain Whitaker walks into that NTSB hearing, it would've been just as effective and probably more moving.As for Denzel Washington's performance, there's no doubt he's delivered one of the best in his career. He literally held the movie together single-handedly; you'd struggle to find a scene without him in it. It's like watching a heavy weight champ at work, he knows exactly when to deliver a punch and where to deliver it to. I'm glad to see him finally back in this kind of roles after so many forgettable ventures in the last 10 years.",7,1,2,16 February 2013
