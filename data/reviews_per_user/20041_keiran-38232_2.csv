The Avengers," Damn that was the most immature and poorly written superhero movie since clooney's batman movies.
","So why do all the heroes have the same personality? why are they all cracking stark themed one liners in every single scene and smirking :S its boring af to watch. They had to have a moment were stark lists why hes different to cap just so the audience can tell them apart hah.urghh where to start this was such a lousy movie. The villian is loki again hes more or less the most edgy, angsty teen style villian you can imagine with no true motivation as to why he is evil in the first place. What i was left out to die by my birth parents and a loving caring family took me in and raised me as their own son? they truly love me and care for me :O well, im going to murder my adopted family now..... what an 'edgelord' character xDHe is happy to sit and wait for the hero's to finish up their playfight with one another while he spectates without trying to flee. The god of mischief not running away when left to his own devices, crazy huh.Next they take banner onto a billion dollar aircraft, and yes i know what you're thinking, literally everyone in the audience is rolling their eyes at this point knowing exactly what is about to happen, heck i expect everyone on the aircraft in the movie were rolling their eyes when they heard banner was coming aboard. Andddd yep he rages out and takes it down killing god knows how many :/ what a twist. During this predictable development, Loki the man responsible stabs the heroes freind and ally Coulson to death and hes harrowing final words are 'ohhhhhh so thats what it does' as he shoots loki of the ship with a 'dock off' sized gun. How touching a sentiment :/ the mcu rally knows how to bring the feels right.The heroes dont really give a fu*k about coulsen though and they quickly run off to crack 200 one liners and to start randomly face planting windows, bro on bro fist pump with the jolly green giant. urghhh its like watching teen titans go at this point, honestly watching it on mute improves the third act drastically the same as with the civil war playfight. Then the egyptian cosplaying aliens all die for some reason. The director never really bothers to show how this is possible. He never foreshadows some form of hive mind concept with a central control ship at any point in the movie, all that happens is the government see the portal in the sky above new york and decide to nuke new york instead...... stark takes the nuke through the portal and miraculously it hits a ship a couple miles away in space, which by happenstance insta kills the entire alien army talk about good luck. That is some next level lazy storytelling right there, just a massive cop out.And the funny mass murderer is interupted mid temper tantrum by the green man and playfully thrown around like a rag doll and left in a ditch as he strolls off and cracks the 201st lame one liner. The camera than zoooooms in for a close up of the bemused expression on the murderers face as he comically sighs into it :/ and this made a billion dollars..... hah. I was fully expecting Arnie to pop in with his Mr.Freeze suit on and crack a cheesy one liner in the after credits but it was just the heros grabbing a snack instead.No funeral scene for coulson or memorial for the countless dead, no attention whatsoever throughout the movie to the heros love interests, they just get sidelined and forgotten about.Overall it was a tone deaf mess of a movie with shoddy storytelling and identical gimmicky characters who showed no emotion.",1,2,3,14 February 2020
Aquaman," Pretty fun and awesome movie. not quite as good as MoS, BVS or WW but close
","It was fun with high energy decent storytelling and a strong villian. I got worried half way through with the MCU joke, as the soldier sticks his head into a toilet to breathe water. :( I was worried we might get a lokiesc(ultronesc, roninesc ect) themed comical beat em up for the villian after that point but the movie got back on track and delivered a rather emotional finale.Overall it wasn't quite as impressive or emotionally deep as Man of Steel, Batman vs Superman or Wonder Woman but still a pleasure to watch and highly recommended. A fantastic addition to the franchise.",9,0,8,14 February 2020
