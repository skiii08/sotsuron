Blade Runner 2049," I would not watch if I knew who directed it
","The director is a master at putting people to sleep. Almost no plot, any plot-like material is stupid, looooong and slow. The director's other movie Arrival was the same. I will be very careful to avoid any further work of his. I watched the 1982 version of BR tens of times. Everything was ahead of its time.
