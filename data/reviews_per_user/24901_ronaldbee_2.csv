Marie Antoinette," A shallow film about shallow people
","There are deep films about shallow people like La Dolce Vita, there are films that probe beneath the rituals of the court like The Rise of Louis XIV, there are films that are rather sympathetic to Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI but have a political and historical dimension like La Marseillaise, but Coppola's film is a shallow film about shallow people, it reveals only the surface rituals of the court, and is a bubble-head's view of history and politics. The revolution is just 'noises off' in the last ten minutes. However, the film is easy on the eye, less easy on the ear and very easy on the brain. I still Coppola is talented, but needs to make a film about less advantaged people next.",3,66,131,26 May 2006
The Last King of Scotland," Pointless, simplistic thriller
","Maybe one day Peter Morgan will come up with something original instead of just taking from documentaries and getting actors to do impersonations. The Last King of Scotland is one of the most simplistic of screenplays, just an excuse for a clich√©d thriller. The last ten minutes are very badly directed. Will the good doctor escape in time? Cross cutting and pounding pop music. Richard Attenborough would have done a better job. Pity someone like Ousmane Sembene didn't make it. Not exactly topical or interesting from a political point of view. Idi Amin was a brutal stupid dictator. Hold the front page. What else is new? It's a sad day if this is the Best British Film, though The Queen isn't much better. Shorter and less bombastic. Actually, The Last King of Scotland reminded me of The King and I. Can't wait for the musical version...",Null,3,4,16 February 2007
