Blade Runner 2049," It is not a complete disaster
","Blade Runner 2049 is not a good film, but it is not a complete disaster. A story that did not need telling and logically failed, an overlong and slow moving narrative and a massacre that makes no sense any longer were countered by original visuals and beautiful women. I will go with a rating of 4/10.The problems with this film is that it has sequeltitis. They came up with it because they needed to make money from a sequel and have no original ideas.
The massacred are peaceful and are farming. Why do it then? The story moves so slowly that the 3 hours seem like 6. The acting is not good, but moderna ctors cannot touch older ones so that is par for the course. When in the original the performance by the chief of police, his goon, the industrialist and the eye maker would rivet and excite or the strong personality of the replicants would make the blood boil here it is a paint by the number series of appearances.With that said the futuristic society is fun to watch. Even more fun is Ana de Armas, the sexy and delicious hooker and even the legs of the Chief (who is old so has short hair unfortunately). These babes add to the vista and architecture that is most pleasing to the eye in this sequel.",4,274,483,13 May 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The force is strong with me!
","I had a bad feeling about this film and I was right. I guess I was warned by the Jar Jar Abrams helmed Episode VII. The force is not strong with this film. It is terrible and weak. It is so bad I am not going to watch anything from Marvel anymore. Those Disney joke movies shall also be boycotted. 
The Last Jedi was weak and stupid. The chubby chick looked like she should be in one of those movies about animals in a farm that Disney should stick with, the sewer cleaner was just plain stupid and not funny (they did try though), the two main characters make the force seem like a subsidiary of Line with video chat capability and even though they took the cash Luke and Leia's faces tell us everything we need to know.
Was this a practical joke by Di$ney?",2,9,11,13 May 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," I do not get it
","The story was ripped off from Episode 3, the jokes didn't belong, the girl cannot act (at least she is thin!) and this director has been discredited several times before.
What were they thinking? I mean, what is their goal here? Could someone enlighten me?",3,9,10,13 May 2018
