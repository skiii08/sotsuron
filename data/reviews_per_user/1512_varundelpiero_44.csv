Changeling," Better than most critics say it is...judge for yourself...
","I intentionally waited a long time to see CHANGELING (as long as three months after its release) due in large part to the lukewarm reviews it received. I now believe that such reviews were given due to Clint Eastwood's long list of recent successes. While CHANGELING is not quite as good as his latest offerings, it is still a worthwhile and memorable watch.The style of CHANGELING (reminiscent of the 'early decades of the 20th century' style used in L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, CHICAGO and CHINATOWN) is visually stunning, and Eastwood manages to infuse an element of film noir into the Motion Picture that I happen to really admire.The story is a quite compelling and engrossing one, as expected of films of this nature, but in my opinion, there was too much focus on the secondary story and not enough on the primary one.Angelina Jolie's acting is not as outstanding as many make it out to be, but it is still a fine piece of work. It's just that she seems lost in the role (not in a good way) and comes off as uncomfortable with such a difficult character to portray. Her Best Actress nomination seemed undeserved when compared to other strong performances that year that didn't make the final cut (most notably Kate Winslet in REVOLUTIONARY ROAD). The rest of the acting is quite excellent, as even the secondary characters deliver solid performances, and manage to outshine Jolie in many instances.All I'm saying is that CHANGELING deserves a chance, regardless of its reviews. If you are a fan of CHINATOWN-styled film noir, you'll probably appreciate this. 9/10. 3.5 stars (out of 4). Should just about enter my Top 200 at 198. Highly recommended.",9,1,6,26 February 2009
Frost_Nixon," Technically superb dramatisation of one of the most important events in American Presidential History...
","Most people are familiar with the term 'Watergate'; it is indelibly etched in most Americans' minds, and any political wrongdoing/scandal is almost immediately given the suffix, '-gate'. A film of this importance, documenting the highly influential Nixon/Frost interviews following Nixon's resignation from High Office, needed to be helmed by a director of Ron Howard's experience. Howard arguably tends to be a bit manipulative and compulsive at times, and a few of his traits are seen here, but in small doses. However, the script is intelligent and compelling, and its brilliance makes this film worthy of viewing. Note that this is by no means a hard-and-fast documentary, as many liberties are taken with some dialogue/events. Nonetheless, the facts are presented as accurately as possible, and one will learn a thing or two from this intriguing film.The cast is superb, and it is this brilliant casting that makes the film work. Michael Sheen (best known for playing Tony Blair in THE QUEEN) is quite impressive as David Frost. Frank Langella is simply outstanding as Nixon; he takes while to develop this influential and difficult character, but by the time the interviews get rolling, he almost becomes Richard Nixon. The synergy between the main characters plays out like a chess match, or a boxing match, with each character countering the other's moves. The interaction is technically superb and really accelerates this film into greatness. The rest of the cast is above adequate, with Kevin Bacon, Oliver Platt, and Sam Rockwell playing memorable roles.FROST/NIXON's nomination for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Lead Actor (Frank Langella) are well-deserved. 9/10. 3.5 stars (out of 4). Should enter my Top 200 at 176. Unreservedly recommended.",9,1,2,17 February 2009
Howl's Moving Castle," Studio Ghibli delivers yet again
","In a climate where animation has moved from primarily hand-drawn to CG-inspired (thanks largely to Disney Studios and Pixar), Hiyao Miyazaki (a notable and well-respected figure in Japan) proves once again that hand-drawn animation can be moving, more picturesque, and more beautiful than its counterpart. This is another visual feast from Studio Ghibli; a true work of art.The story itself is a rather fascinating one, again catered for more mature audiences as opposed to children. The story develops at pace, and moves along smoothly until the last 20 minutes or so where the ending feels a bit rushed and out-of-time with the rest of the film. This may have been due to Miyazaki's intention to complete the film in less than 2 hours.For me, HAURU NO UGOKU SHIRO was not as enjoyable as my first Miyazaki film, SEN TO CHIHIRO NO KAMIKAKUSHI. But that's not to say that I did not enjoy it thoroughly. One of my main complaints was that I did not feel as connected to Sophie as I did to Chihiro (of SEN TO CHIHIRO NO KAMIKAKUSHI). I also felt that Howl was a bit too petulant and moody for my liking. Nonetheless, the vast array of characters and creatures makes this a truly worthwhile watch. A final note about the voice acting (featuring Christian Bale and Emily Mortimer as the leads): it at times feels bland and generic and Billy Crystal has to step in to save the day with his comedic voice talents. Another problem that I personally had was the constant shifting of Sophie's appearance during the film, depending on who she interacts with, and what she does.Overall, this is a fantastic film, with awesome visuals, and a moving score to match. Not as amazing as SEN TO CHIHIRO NO KAMIKAKUSHI, but a rewarding experience nonetheless. 8/10. 3 stars (out of 4). Should enter my Top 300 at 257. Strongly recommended.",8,0,1,26 January 2009
In Bruges," A welcome surprise...
","In my opinion, Martin McDonagh's directorial debut can easily be classified as a resounding success. From the opening sequence, straight to the (almost too far-fetched) ending, IN BRUGES is full of energy and intrigue. The screenplay is quite brilliant, especially for the first 80-85 minutes or so, mixing elements of comedy, drama, and thriller in a quite enjoyable Motion Picture. The last 10-15 minutes, however, arguably seem rushed, as if McDonagh had almost felt as if he had written himself into the proverbial corner. Some of the events that occur here seem a bit too improbable (at least two such events come to mind) and out-of-touch with the deliberate pacing of the rest of the film. Nonetheless, the Academy saw it fit to nominate his work for Best Original Screenplay, and I personally applaud the nomination, despite the aforementioned flaws.I have always been a fan of Colin Farrell for his performances of unorthodox roles/characters, and this has to be one of his best portrayals in years. Brendan Gleeson is also fantastic as his more level-headed companion, and the synergy between the lead characters is quite awesome. Ralph Fiennes reprises another villainous role, and does so quite superbly. In all, the casting was excellent, as the characters manage to enhance the already brilliant screenplay. Moreover, the cinematography and score are very good, with the scenic shots of Bruges enhancing the overall atmosphere of the film.IN BRUGES is full of memorable scenes and lines, undoubtedly accentuated by the Irish tongues of Farrell and Gleeson. Worthy of multiple viewings. 8/10. 3 stars (out of 4). Should enter my Top 200 at 183. Highly recommended.",8,1,4,17 February 2009
Chinatown," One of the finest pieces of American cinema...
","1974 was just a great year for The Motion Picture. Not only did it produce such works as THE GODFATHER PART II (possible the best movie of ALL time), THE TOWERING INFERNO, LENNY, A WOMAN UNDER THE INFLUENCE, and THE CONVERSATION, but added to that esteemed list is the magnificent CHINATOWN, which is perhaps the finest piece of film noir ever created (save for L.A. CONFIDENTIAL).Roman Polanski's thriller/mystery is easily the best film of his fine catalog, though some may argue that THE PIANIST was much more powerful. The direction and style are simply brilliant, and every scene of CHINATOWN's ~210 minute run-time is excellent, and serves a purpose in the telling of the story.The screenplay itself is also excellent, and Robert Towne deserved the Oscar hands-down. There are enough twists and turns here to keep the viewer on edge, and warrant multiple viewings. This film is not for those who find it hard to pay attention unless there is a mindless explosion or chase-sequence every 5 minutes. It is worth noting here that Towne and Polanski had a bitter series of conflicts regarding the ending of the film; a series which Polanski eventually won, much to the delight of film noir enthusiasts everywhere. Towne's ending was less realistic and more pretentious, and years later he realised that the right choice was indeed made.Jack Nicholson produces perhaps his finest piece of work, arguably even better than ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST and AS GOOD AS IT GETS. Indeed this was the film that propelled Nicholson to the level of 'superstar', and rightly so. From the start of the movie, the viewer gets the sense that his character is just another generic, super-heroic, super-smart, invincible P.I. who never seems to falter. However, as the character develops, we see that this is not the case, as we discover that the character is actually human; he feels, he cares, he makes mistakes, he even bleeds.Faye Dunaway is equally impressive as the 'femme fatale', and her interaction with Nicholson will keep the viewer intrigued and entertained. John Huston pulls off the greedy wealthy 'super-villain' as effectively as any other actor, yet for some unknown reason fell short of an Oscar nomination.The cinematography and set design are excellent, as Alonzo recreates 1930s Los Angeles in a beautifully flawless manner. The use of colour (which was seen as somewhat 'taboo' in film noirs at that time) was effective, and helped to enhance the picture rather than distract attention from the main plot.This is definitely a film that deserves multiple viewings as mentioned earlier, so that the viewer can piece together the mystery in hindsight, and discover elements that he/she missed on the first viewing. The film and screenplay could potentially work quite effectively as teaching tools in film/literature schools as the efficacy and power evoked in the direction and writing are top-notch. Indeed, the whole notion of 'CHINATOWN' works not only as a locale, but on a more profound level as a state of mind.This is altogether a brilliant movie and garners a place on any serious film viewer's Top 100. It should enter mine at #84 or so. Were it not for the supremely excellent THE GODFATHER PART II, this film would have won the Best Picture Oscar, and Roman Polanski would have won his first Best Director Oscar. (Note: He eventually won Best Director in 2002 for THE PIANIST)4 stars (out of 4). 9/10. Unreservedly recommended.",9,1,3,30 October 2008
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Apatow delivers...again...
","I am no fan of typical romance movies. I am no fan of cheesy comedy movies. And I fully despise the traditional romantic comedy. Yet, the Judd Apatow company has succeeded for the third time (following the THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN and KNOCKED UP) in getting me to appreciate a romantic comedy. But let's be frank here: calling FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL a typical romantic comedy is doing it a great disservice. Apatow has specialised in merging the male raunchy comedy with the female romantic comedy to create something that is quite watchable, by all audiences.The story is a rather good one, following the fortunes and misfortunes of a man trying to get over a break-up after a nearly 6 year relationship. While the story is pleasant overall, there are moments that feel rather cheesy, tacky, and over-done or superfluous. Surprisingly that does little to take away from the film. The acting is rather top-notch, as Jason Segel (who also helped pen the screenplay, and is a name to watch for in the future) does a brilliant job of portraying the 'lovable loser' protagonist. Mila Kunis was the standout for me, not only because she was easy on the eyes, but she demonstrated a comedic range and timing befitting of her character. Kirsten Bell is also quite good, as is Russell Brand, who infuses his own brand of humour into this vehicle. The supporting cast is also decent, and there are no discernible weak links. Kudos to Paul Rudd, who has to be one of the most dependable, yet under-appreciated comedic actors today.The main selling point of this film is its humour. Where typical male comedies go to great lengths to be vulgar and derisive, FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL takes the higher, less disgusting, less raunchy road. That's not to say there's not much for guys to laugh at, as I found that this film was quite hilarious. The other big selling point was the romance, and Apatow made sure that the romantic elements in this movie felt real, and not overly cheesy. The balance between the romantic aspects and the raunchy aspects was almost perfect.For the third time in a row, the Apatow gang has made me appreciate a 'romantic comedy'. If that's not genius, I don't know what is. 8/10. 3 stars. Will garner a spot on my 'Honourable Mentions' list. Recommended.",8,1,4,1 December 2008
12 Monkeys," Deliciously intelligent and apocalyptic sci-fi thriller...
","I have a certain amount of respect for film-makers who venture to create a time-travel movie, simply because of the risk and complexity involved; it is no secret that many of these films are flops due in part to the uncertainties of the science, and the confusion they cause many viewers as the events unfold on-screen. As such, it is difficult to convey the paradox(es) established in these stories in a single Motion Picture as opposed to say, a novel. That being said, TWELVE MONKEYS works because it manages to overcome these flaws (for the most part) and provide viewers with a fresh, intelligent, and logical movie-going experience that is bound to stay with them for a while. My initial impression of TWELVE MONKEYS was that it appeared to be a combination of DONNIE DARKO and ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, with a hint of the deep-lying anti-societal messages (and the Brad Pitt) contained in FIGHT CLUB. I loved these movies, and needless to say, I loved TWELVE MONKEYS.The storyline is a very good one, spanning as many as four different time zones in order to tell the story. This is simply a wonderful science-fiction movie, with an underlying dark, brooding psychological thriller aspect, reminiscent of course, of DONNIE DARKO (though the latter was released six years after the former; it's just that I SAW DONNIE DARKO first).The direction by MONTY PYTHON's Terry Gilliam is superb, as are the cinematography and set design, with one of the opening shots of Philadelphia's City Hall overrun by animals setting the dark mood for the rest of the film. The acting by Bruce Willis and Madeleine Stowe is sufficient, but Brad Pitt was the stand-out for me, though his portrayal was admittedly over-the-top. It's just that every time the movie shifted from his character, there was an appreciable drop in energy. I guess even the Academy thought likewise, enough so that they saw it fit to nominate him for Best Supporting Actor.TWELVE MONKEYS is a unique, intelligent, logical, and edgy Motion Picture that will challenge viewers and keep them involved throughout. The main character in the movie doesn't set about to change time (as is the case in most of these sci-fi time-travel movies) thereby creating another paradox; instead he sets about to study the events of the past in an effort to better the future. The screenwriters, David and Janet Peoples, set the movie in such a way that the viewer gets to decide what happens/happened, and as such TWELVE MONKEYS has sparked numerous intellectual debates, and will continue to do so for some time.9/10. 3.5. stars (out of 4). Will enter my Top 150 at #123. Highly recommended.",9,5,7,12 November 2008
12 Angry Men," Reasonable Doubt...
","The concept of 'Reasonable Doubt' is highly pervasive within the Judicial System; it is the concept that eventually decides the fates of the accused, and is the concept that is one of the most controversial. It's controversy lies in the fact that it is purely subjective, and dependent on the individuals that comprise the jury. The notion of Reasonable Doubt has no one definition, yet it is almost universally known. In 12 ANGRY MEN, Sidney Lumet successfully gives the viewer an idea of how this concept comes into play in a trial.It is worth noting that while this may be one of the best courtroom movies of all time, it doesn't in fact occur in the actual courtroom; all but 3 or 4 minutes of this Motion Picture is spent in the confines of a Jury Room, where the verdict is hotly debated. Lumet does well to present the Room as a sort of confinement from which there is no escape until a unanimous verdict is decided. As the film progresses, the sense of urgency and claustrophobia sets in, and the tension becomes increasingly high. The first technique Lumet used was to employ the locked door. The second was to cue the rain, which gives the feeling that even the outdoors are 'inaccessible' and that only the Room exists. The third technique may be missed by less astute viewers; Lumet switches his scope from wide to narrow to close-up during the movie, which adds to the claustrophobic feeling mentioned earlier.The acting is top-notch, as required by any good character study. All 12 men have been developed to some appreciable extent, but the key players have been developed to a comprehensive level given the film's ~95 minute run-time. Henry Fonda is brilliant as the 'hesitant' juror, but to me Lee J. Cobb outshines him in almost every scene (save the opening scenes).Another aspect of the film worth mentioning is the Music (or lack thereof). This is another intentional ploy by Lumet to give the viewer a 'feel' of the Room. There is no Music in the Jury Room, so why should there be in this film? I agree that while a musical background score serves to enhance or capture the mood of the scene, sometimes the absence of the music (silence) speaks volumes, by allowing the viewer to concentrate fully on the scene(s). One of my favourite movies lacking in music is NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. Another brilliant score-less Motion Picture is CAST AWAY, where no music is used for the entire length of time that Tom Hanks is stranded.The screenplay is solid and intelligently sound. In fact the only thing that stopped this film from winning Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay was the excellent THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. Had the movie been made a year or two earlier, it may well have won the esteemed accolades.I can see why this film ranks in IMDb's All-time Top 10. It is simply a brilliant Motion Picture that has wide appeal, and can be enjoyed and appreciated by many.4 stars (out of 4). 8/10. Will appear in my Top 200 at around 167 or so. Strongly recommended.",9,1,1,27 October 2008
Superbad," Apatow Productions strikes comedic gold yet again
","To classify SUPERBAD as a teen sex comedy is to do a fresh and funny film a great disservice. SUPERBAD, helmed by Greg Mottola of the Apatow gang, while creating a funny and somewhat raunchy (but not over-the-top) comedy with numerous laughs, manages to bring the characters into the focus and keep them there; not an easy task for a movie of this kind.Michael Cera's deadpan and sarcastic approach to his character never seems to get stale, and Jonah Hill provides the ultimate opposite, forming a dynamic and funny duo. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is perhaps the most hilarious of the three, as the now infamous McLovin. Seth Rogen is also quite good as the dysfunctional police officer. My biggest gripe here is that the film is too long for its nature (~110 minutes). A more stern film editor may have opted to omit some more superfluous scenes involving the police officers, while concentrating more on the central duo/trio.SUPERBAD is meant to bring back high-school memories to persons of any age who have had similar experiences, and does so in a relatively tasteful and nostalgic manner, getting most of the key elements right. Not quite comedic genius, but more of a coming-of-age tale. Comedy itself is rather subjective in nature, and a lot will undoubtedly depend on the viewer. Another gem from the Apatow gang. A solid 7/10 and 3 stars (out of 4). Should just about appear in my Top 300 at 277. Recommended.",7,1,4,26 January 2009
Ed Wood," Black-and-white, and full of colour...
","ED WOOD is essentially a biopic about a guy who is listed as the 'Worst Director of All Time' and whose biggest movie PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE was labelled 'one of the worst movies ever made'. So there's no reason why this wouldn't generate a significant cult following, as viewers would flock to it 'just because...'.The movie itself, shot entirely in black-and-white, is pretty decent. The screen writing is above par and goes to great lengths to examine the complexities of directing and producing a movie with little or no capital at one's disposal. Tim Burton was suitably billed to direct this feature, and his homage to the vintage science-fiction/horror is a testament to fine movie-making. To me, Burton is just one of those guys who revels in the extraordinary.Johnny Depp is brilliant as the cross-dressing, mediocre writer/director/producer/actor Ed Wood who became renowned for the unbelievable speed with which he shot movies (not bothering to re-shoot scenes even where there are obvious flaws), but to me, the real star of the show is Martin Landau, who plays the once famous Bela Lugosi, a man who is now aging, addicted to morphine, and haunted by loneliness and lost fame. Landau deservedly picked up an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor and, as Lugosi, steals almost every scene in which he appears, such that there is a considerable drop-off in excitement every time the movie switches focus away from his character. This leads me to wonder if the film should have focused more on Lugosi than Wood...The costume design, set design, and makeup are simply superb, and the Oscar won for Best Makeup was well-justified. Film-makers in the future would do well to follow the design aspects of this Motion Picture.In conclusion, the movie is slightly better-than-good, but rarely reaches the pinnacles of greatness. The nature of the subject will undoubtedly continue to draw a serious cult following and it is no surprise that this movie is featured in IMDb's Top 250 (as I write it stands at #192). The movie is quite entertaining and watchable for most of its ~125 minute run-time.Deserving of 3 stars (out of 4) and a rating of 8/10. I have no problem placing this film in my 'Honourable Mention' list. Recommended.",8,0,0,7 November 2008
Milk," If only more directors of today had Gus Van Sant's courage and vision...
","The story of Harvey Milk is one that very few are aware of, but it is arguably one of the most important and controversial stories in the recent History of the United States. Gus Van Sant successfully and competently brings the story of the first openly homosexual man elected to office, and does so without infusing any degree of pretension, hypocrisy, or melodrama (which would have been easy to do in a biopic of this nature). Indeed, viewers are treated to a smart, emotional, and historically-accurate portrayal of one of the most influential characters in the history of the Human Rights Movement. The story is supported by numerous historical/archival clips dealing with, and related to the key incidents of the story.The ensemble is impeccably cast, with Sean Penn in perhaps his best bit of acting following MYSTIC RIVER. Again, Penn avoids the expected pretentiousness and melodrama that a role like this may entail, to excellent effect. The nomination for Best Lead Actor was well-warranted, and may very well result in a victory. Josh Brolin's nomination for Best Supporting Actor was equally well-warranted, as he does more in his expressions and mannerisms to portray his character's dilemmas and tribulations than many of today's actors can. Emile Hirsch and James Franco are equally impressive.The screenplay (written directly for the screen), direction, and cinematography are quite excellent, and serve to make this technically one of the best films of 2008. It is no surprise that MILK was nominated for Best Picture, thought the controversial subject matter, coupled with a strong field may well prevent it from achieving ultimate victory. It is also my fear that IMDb ratings and box-office numbers will falter due to the raw subject matter.9/10. 4 stars (out of 4). Will enter my Top 150 at 148. Unreservedly recommended.",9,0,4,17 February 2009
The Bourne Ultimatum," Save the best for last...
","'Look at this. Look at what they make you give'.THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM successfully redeems the Jason Bourne franchise, after the debacle that was THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, with an adrenaline-filled visceral ride through Northern Africa, Europe, and North America. Though not as intelligent as the original THE BOURNE IDENTITY, THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM is purely fast-paced action at its best. That's not to say the screenplay is poor or unintelligent; it's actually quite good, and writer Tony Gilroy puts a lot of work into it. Seeing this film after THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, one might not be able to tell that it was done by the same director (Paul Greengrass, of UNITED 93 fame). Greengrass totally redeems the series with a stunningly intense and resolute Motion Picture.The acting is again more impressive than that in the usual action thriller, and viewers (myself included) are slowly starting to like the way Matt Damon portrays Jason Bourne: with a low-key, emotionless, and nonchalant attitude. Julia Stiles has a bigger role this time around and does surprisingly well. Joan Allen is also good, and David Straithairn is simply a wonderful addition to the ensemble, as his portrayal of Vosen is almost flawless and believable.The action is top-notch. I am personally not a fan of over-the-top action thrillers, but there are at least two lengthy sequences in this film that will draw many viewers in because they are so intelligently compelling and involving. Greengrass has the same 'shaky-camera' 'problem' that pervaded THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, and while the camera work is not as crisp as in THE BOURNE IDENTITY, it's not as nauseating this time around, except for some of the hand-to-hand combat scenes. I suppose this was deliberate since I have noticed that some of the still close-ups are not without their 'shakiness'. My guess is that Greengrass does this intentionally to maintain the overall kineticism of the movie...who knows?As mentioned, the writing isn't as good as the original THE BOURNE IDENTITY, but it is miles ahead of the sequel, and there is good development of characters and plot. As has become the case with many 'three-quels' these days, a lot of the story deals with past events (explanatory events that occurred prior to the original), and they are quite enjoyable.THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM surprisingly walked away with three production Oscars (Editing, Sound, and Sound Editing), and a close look at the film will reveal why: the sound editing editing is crisp and fresh; a departure from many action films.Although I preferred THE BOURNE IDENTITY to this one, I will give THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM an 8/10 (even though the original got a 7) based purely on expectation and delivery; after THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, and after learning that Greengrass would helm this film as well, I expected the worst, and was pleasantly surprised. 3.5 stars (out of 4). The trilogy should, based on the strength of parts 1 and 3, make my 'Honourable Mentions' list. Highly recommended.",8,0,1,27 November 2008
Burn After Reading," Technically superb and complex Coen Brothers offering, but not without flaws...
","The Coen Brothers have touched upon so many film genres and combinations that it's getting harder and harder to keep track. Their follow-up to Best Picture of 2007, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, is a delightfully complex comedy noir/thriller (that's the best description I could come up with) that won't win any awards but will live long in the memory.The plot is complex, as expected, and filled with numerous twists (also expected), and most are done in an intelligent and complex manner. The cast is brilliant, with George Clooney (who seems to save his most hilarious performances for the Coen Brothers and Steven Soderbergh) leading the line in fine form. Frances McDormand is equally superb. Tilda Swinton apparently reprises her ice-queen role from THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE. John Malkovich takes advantage of his (apparent) semi-retirement to produce a quite captivating performance. Brad Pitt is good, but in my opinion there was a degree of (warranted?) overacting to his role.BURN AFTER READING is not a masterpiece. At its worst it is an entertaining ride, full of unexpected plot twists and intertwining characters. At its best it can make for a delicious study of comedy noir/thrillers. The Coen Brothers rarely (if ever) disappoint. 8/10. 3 stars (out of 4). Recommended, simply because it's the Coen Brothers, and it's (therefore) unique.",8,1,4,17 February 2009
The Bourne Identity," Better than the average...
","THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a pure and straightforward action thriller with solid writing and acting; no more, no less. It is superior to most films that fall in this genre because it manages to stay away from most of the worn-out action clichés, while focusing more on character/plot development and exposition than the action sequences.Doug Liman and Tony Gilroy have created a fresh action thriller with THE BOURNE IDENTITY; one that will entertain many viewers without feeling stale or overstaying its welcome. The acting is pretty top-notch, with Matt Damon's emotionless and laid-back approach to his character a welcome one in a genre dominated by overacting or poor acting. Chris Cooper and Franka Potente play their supporting roles well, and Potente adds a nice contrast to Damon's Bourne. Clive Owen has a brief cameo that is worth mentioning.So what about the action? Well, there is an obligatory car chase that gets a bit old after the first two or three minutes or so. Frankly, I don't see why these pointless scenes have become a requisite for the genre. This chase adds nothing that viewers haven't seen before, and didn't really have to be that long. The fight sequences are worth watching, and many of them involve some sleek hand-to-hand combat, which are thankfully well-edited and choreographed. But the real selling point is not the action, but the screenplay (as written by Tony Gilroy) which keeps the more intellectual viewers on edge trying to figure out Bourne's identity. The exposition is well-written and doesn't come out of the blue. Again, top marks for writing; something that is usually absent in action thrillers.The editing is crisp and clean, making the movie-going experience worthwhile. I decided to mention this because most action movies have dreadful editing, to the point where the action sequences seem blurry and nauseating. The music in this film is also worth mentioning, as it contains a modern upbeat feel that suits the movie well.A final note about Jason Bourne's past: it is worth noting that screenplays that encourage viewers to root for a character with a shady past/present are usually frowned upon by many 'upstanding citizens'. I bring to mind the recent controversy surrounding the popularity of Showtime's DEXTER series. I was impressed by Gilroy's ability to write the past Bourne as different from the present Bourne due to the amnesia. It should at lest keep these 'concerned' folks quiet.All in all, a great film. That's right. I am no fan of action thrillers but this one is miles ahead of the ordinary. It is intelligent and well-paced, and will give viewers exactly what they expect, and more. Deserves a solid 7/10 and 3 stars (out of 4).",7,1,2,26 November 2008
Dark City," A visual and intellectual masterpiece...
","Is an individual nothing more than the sum of his/her memories? If you strip away these memories and replace them with others, does the person stop being himself/herself? These are some of the age-old questions that Alex Proyas seeks to examine in DARK CITY. If the name Alex Proyas seems familiar, it's because he was the man who brought us the fantastic story and cinematics in THE CROW. But don't go thinking that Proyas is just a one-hit wonder, because he takes some of the best elements from THE CROW and fuses it with profoundness and intellect, resulting in a magnificent Motion Picture in DARK CITY.The atmosphere and environment presented in DARK CITY are as engaging and as compelling as one will ever see in film. It grips you from the start and doesn't let go until the end credits roll. The viewer will feel totally immersed in Proyas' imagination and will become totally focused. And focus is important here because the viewer needs to pay careful attention to some of the little intricacies in this movie, in order to fully grasp the story. This is to say that this film is not just a visual feast devoid of substance. In a rare and delightful occurrence, viewers are treated not only to a visual cinematic feast, but one that will challenge them intellectually and perhaps emotionally.The acting is top-notch here, and Rufus Sewell was perfectly cast as the bewildered protagonist. Kiefer Sutherland is effective as the scientist, and Jennifer Connelly does adequately well. William Hurt has a small part in this film, and is as dependable and reliable as ever. But the real star here is Alex Proyas, as the story and the cinematography will rip you away from the real world and into his fantasy for the entire ~100 minute run-time of this feature. Admittedly, the story takes a while to develop and unravel its key points, but this may have been deliberate, and is an effective technique when it works. Take it from me: it works.This is simply a wonderful and fascinating Motion Picture by a truly visionary directory, incorporating not only the fantastic elements of THE CROW, but bringing to mind such features as THE TWILIGHT ZONE, VERTIGO, and even THE TRUMAN SHOW to name a few.This movie warrants a 9/10 rating and 3.5 stars (out of 4).

Spirited Away," Fantastic animated adventure at its most compelling and heartwarming...
","I'll start off with a little confession: I am NOT a big fan of Japanese anime. The good ones are much too hard to find and always seem to be lost within a huge cluttered mass of cheesy garbage. You'll see about 100 lame ones before you manage to find a true gem. My favourite has always been COWBOY BEBOP, but even then I haven't followed the entire series. Additionally, I am NOT a big fan of animated movies. They always seem a bit too predictable, as if they cater specifically to certain viewers. In the end animated movies (especially of the Disney variety) seem only interested in box office numbers, and they continually insult the intelligence of their viewers.I've long heard of Hayao Miyazaki's legendary status in Japan by a few trustworthy friends of mine, and my relative distaste of animated movies has resulted in me waiting a full 7 years before procuring a copy of SPIRITED AWAY. I tried to get my hands on the original Japanese copy with English subtitles but could only manage the more available dubbed copy. I was initially fearful that the dubbing would be embarrassingly poor (like most Japanese to English dubs) but I was somewhat mistaken. The voices actually fit in pretty well. The only real complaint is that the protagonist starts to get annoying after a while, if only sporadically so.But let's shift gears and focus on the good, and there is no shortage of that here. First off, the animation is simply breathtaking. I heard about Miyazaki before but really wasn't expecting anything quite as visually satisfying as this. Every detail is accounted for, and the rain sequences are especially beautiful. The scenic shots have an epic eeriness to them, and are simply stunning. Anyone who hasn't seen Miyazaki's work before will be mesmerised. It has been said that he is somewhat meticulous, and this comes off strongly in his animation. Studio Ghibli rivals Disney and Pixar any day for me, and it is worth noting that most of the animation is done traditionally, with very few computer-enhanced effects. Some digitising is done only to finish up the product.Another category in which Miyazaki trumps Disney is the storytelling. Miyazaki presents a beautiful and intertwined story with many surprising plot twists, all of which are believable and don't seem like they just come 'out of the blue'. The story itself is a beautiful one about friendship and love that almost everyone can relate to and enjoy , but that's only on the surface. Beneath the main storyline are some strong hidden messages which many may not get, for instance, Miyazaki, being a strong environmentalist like myself, sends little messages speaking to humanity's destruction/pollution of their living environment, and this is especially evident in one beautiful scene. Unlike Disney, Miyazaki doesn't give the viewers emotional 'cues'. He does not tell you when you should laugh and when you should cry. This is all left to the viewer to decide. Indeed, not enough can be said for the engrossing story, and at the end you will try to remember the last time 2 hours went by so quickly.The music is also superb. From the opening sequence straight to the ending credits, the viewer is greeted by lovely moving pieces of well-orchestrated music which blend well with the story (yes, real music). This only adds to the whole experience, and helps make the move feels REAL and lifelike. You will find yourself actually having FEELINGS during this movie, and genuine ones too; not the fabricated ones that you get from the Western animated movies. You will laugh aloud. You will cry real tears. And at the end you will understand why Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli are thought of much more highly than Disney and Pixar, especially by those mature enough to appreciate the differences.I strongly recommend seeing this one. It was my first Miyazaki film experience, and my only regret is that I waited this long to see it. I am now in the process of trying to obtain HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE...4 stars (out of 4). 9/10. May just fall short of my Top 100, at about 103 or so.",10,0,0,21 October 2008
Tropic Thunder," Hilariously brilliant...
","TROPIC THUNDER is the movie that all the horrendous EPIC MOVIEs, DATE MOVIEs, SCARY MOVIEs, etc. wanted to be. It is perhaps the best and funniest spoof of Hollywood made thus far. The manner in which it is done is technically brilliant, as there are very few outright/direct spoofs; much of the humour comes from the subtext. Everything from movie trailers to awards nominations are tackled head-on, but done with taste and intelligence (something comedies of this ilk lack) and not catered to derive cheap laughs from brainless morons.Ben Stiller knows enough of Hollywood to know how the system works, and in his directorial role, he uses almost every bit of that knowledge to poke intelligent fun at Hollywood's operations.The film's cast is star-studded, as expected, and there are enough cameos to keep the avid viewer alert. Ben Stiller himself is hilarious, as is Jack Black. To me the real standout is Robert Downey Jr., who continues his career revival in one of the funniest roles seen in a long time. Another standout is the almost unrecognisable Tom Cruise (in fat suit), who steps out of his comfort zone, and shows his willingness to poke fun at himself, to deliver a memorably hilarious performance. It is worth the admission price by itself. I must admit here that I was unaware that it was Tom Cruise until the ending credits rolled. Needless to say, I felt a bit embarrassed and shocked at the same time, and immediately saw the movie for a second time. The only out-of-place actor is Nick Nolte, who seems to take his role a bit too seriously.My only complaint here was the running-length of the film. Comedies that stretch over the 95-100 minute mark usually overindulge or include material that seems superfluous. This is the case here, but it's only a small gripe, given the overall quality of the film. 8/10, 3 stars (out of 4). Should garner a place on my Honourable Mentions list. Highly recommended.",8,1,2,17 February 2009
The Pianist," Through the suffering and the anguish, the hope and the music live on...
","THE PIANIST is arguably Roman Polanski's best movie to date, perhaps even better than the excellent CHINATOWN. This account of the suffering of the Jews at the hands of the Nazis in Warsaw is as emotionally hard-hitting as any you will ever see. Polanski doesn't hold any punches or try to sugar-coat the story as the scenes of execution, violence, and torture are overwhelmingly strong, and may upset many weak-stomached viewers. What's more is that Polanski does not even focus on Auschwitz, as he chooses to document the suffering that took place in Warsaw, through our protagonist Wladislaw Szpilman (who is the only character to get significant screen-time).Adrien Brody's performance as Szpilman is powerful and compelling and his transformation from a well-off, cultured, and respected musician to a weak and starving refugee fighting for survival is almost unwatchable; such is its realism. Brody deservedly picked up the Best Actor Oscar in the performance of a lifetime.The screenplay is exceptional, adapted from the book written by the real Wladislaw Szpilman documenting his real-life experiences. The Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar was well-warranted. Viewers will not soon forget THE PIANIST, as some of the scenes are so powerful and moving that they stay with the viewer long after the end credits roll.Polanski effectively hits the nail squarely on its head in this bleak and unflinching Motion Picture, not bothering to infuse his account with melodrama or pretentiousness, or insult the intelligence of the viewers by watering-down some of the more shocking scenes. In fact, the detached style is more similar to a documentary than a conventional Motion Picture.This is simply a solid and sobering drama, the likes of which are rarely seen these days. The ending fits in well, and serves to offer a message of hope, while implying that the events of the past cannot, and must never be forgotten, as these events often shape and influence the present and the future.4 stars (out of 4). 9/10. Will enter my Top 100 at #87. Unreservedly recommended.",9,0,1,10 November 2008
Revolutionary Road," Powerfully and compellingly depressing film about the emptiness of Suburbia...
","Sam Mendes, in an effective follow-up of sorts to American BEAUTY (I say follow-up because both films touch on the same subject matter), has created a film that is amazingly realistic and compelling, and examines life in Suburbia to the extent that most directors are afraid to go.The acting by Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet is astounding and is reason enough to watch the film. It amazes me how neither of these performances was nominated for Lead Acting Oscars. DiCaprio portrays Frank Wheeler in a powerful yet laid-back manner, while Winslet as April Wheeler is simply stunning. By themselves, they are fantastic, but together they forge a combative and forceful on-screen relationship that is in no way comparable to the overly romantic one seen in 1997's TITANIC. The excellent acting is not only confined within the lead roles, as Kathy Bates and Michael Shannon do more than adequate jobs in their supporting roles. The latter was actually nominated for Best Supporting Actor.Not much has been said by critics in terms of story/character development, but in my opinion, this is one of the most engrossing films I have seen for the Awards season. Likewise, not enough has been said about the score, which is effectively low-key with a hint of deep-set and ominous gloom; perfect for setting the overall mood of the film as it creates an uneasy atmosphere. The cinematography, camera-work, set design, and costume design were all remarkable, and the viewer would have felt engrossed in the 1960s atmosphere presented.Overall, a truly captivating Motion Picture; one that should not be missed. 8/10. 3.5 stars (out of 4). Should enter my Top 200 at 166. Highly recommended.",8,1,1,17 February 2009
Lawrence of Arabia," An epic in every sense of the word...
","LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is the kind of long and sprawling epic that needs to be seen on a large projection screen in order to fully take in the beauty of the cinematography. Unfortunately, where I come from, there is absolutely no chance of seeing it the way it was meant to be seen. Nevertheless, it was a spectacular and riveting visual feast, and one of the best character studies of all time, reminiscent of the remarkable PATTON, where the epic battles scenes serve primarily for character development, and secondarily for visceral appeal.Though a bit too long for my liking (I had to watch it in two sittings, although this was no fault of mine) it was an exceptional film, and were it seen projected, the length (over 3.5 hours, Director's Cut) may not have been an issue.Peter O'Toole is fantastic in the lead role, and this has to go down as his best ever performance in a stellar career. Omar Sharif and Alec Guinness are also impeccable.This film boasts, along with an intelligent screenplay, an engrossing story, marvelously breathtaking cinematography, and a remarkably epic score (though the score was somewhat under appreciated).This film is well worth the time, and well deserving of the Best Picture and Best Director (David Lean) Oscars for 1962. 8/10. 4 stars (out of 4). Will enter my Top 200 at #161. Highly recommended.",8,0,1,8 December 2008
The Lives of Others," Engrossing, compelling, and engaging...a German masterpiece...
","My experience with German cinema is not very vast; the most recent film I saw out of Germany was the excellent DER UNTERGANG, which was good enough to garner a spot in my Top 100. The style of DAS LEBEN DER ANDEREN is equally impeccable and it is difficult not to appreciate, regardless of one's taste in film. The story itself is a truly remarkable and unforgettable one; one that will captivate many viewers.While none of the main characters are one-dimensional (thankfully), the real protagonist of the story is Gerd Wiesler, played by the late Ulrich Muhe. This is easily one of the greatest portrayals I have seen in a while, and the portrayal makes for a great character study. Wiesler is easy to relate to on the surface, but carries with him an air of melancholy, loneliness, and longing. When he spies on the couple, one begins to understand his emotional transformation, as their lives are filled with the things that his life is devoid of: passion, love, art, and desire. They live in a rather lush apartment, while his is more like a motel room than anything, devoid of life and feeling, much like his existence. He ultimately begins to care for the couple and assumes the role of 'Guardian Angel', at the risk of losing his job, and his favour with the Stasi. The scene in which the viewer realises that he chooses to move from detached observer to active participant is gripping and sets the tone for the rest of the movie.The acting is superb overall, though I haven't heard of any of the actors before this feature, and the screenplay and cinematography are equally excellent. This is an overall brilliant film; it is intelligent and complex without being overly melodramatic, and manages to speak to the heart with no need for bombastic mind-numbing special effects. My only real regret is that the film opened only as a limited release, and many viewers were thereby deprived of a truly rich and rewarding cinematic experience. I heard that there was an American remake in the pipelines, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with this original, and if one must make an extra effort to see it, it would be worth it. This is quite easily one of the best movies of 2006/2007.9/10. 3.5 stars (out of 4). Should enter my Top 150 at #116. Highly recommended.",9,0,0,11 November 2008
The Mist," Everything a Horror Movie should beand more
","Frank Darabont's THE MIST is perhaps the third best adaptation of a Stephen King novel/novella after THE GREEN MILE and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, and is quite likely the best adaptation of a predominantly horror-infused work from the 'Master of Horror'.From the intro, THE MIST grabs the viewer, and doesn't let go until the climactic ending sequence. Even the quiet, 'safe' moments are filled with a palpable and real tension that few of these modern horrors fail to provide.The acting is quite solid, as even the 'small-part' characters seem realistic and well-drawn. Thomas Jane does a more than adequate job of playing the strong and rational protagonist. Opposite him, Marcia Gay Harden is extremely effective as the Bible-quoting, holier-than-thou prophetess, foretelling the impending Apocalypse and unstoppable Doom. It is her character that invokes the biggest emotional response from audiencesafter the creatures, of course.THE MIST is not just a good horror movie; it is a fascinating study of fear, paranoia, hopelessness, religious fanaticism, and the human response. This is a compelling and thought-provoking film that will surprise many viewers. A special note must be made about the ending: while many viewers complain that it was in poor taste, or unnecessary, I wholeheartedly disagree. The atmosphere, music, and the very events of the ending propelled this film from good to great. It is also worth noting that Darabont deviated from King's ending, which turned out to be a welcome surprise from someone who sticks rather strongly to the source.The only thing preventing me from giving this film a perfect 4-star rating is the half-hearted 'explanation' of the events. Darabont, whose strength lies in creating atmosphere and mystery, would have done well to leave this up to the viewer to decide on and speculate upon. Nonetheless, a 3.5 star rating is a deserved one. The film also warrants a 9/10, and should appear in my Top 150 at 138. Highly recommended.",9,3,7,26 January 2009
Amadeus," Rock me Amadeus...
","For all intents and purposes, I have split this review/comment into two portions, namely the subjective and the objective.Let's begin with the subjective: I personally don't like musicals on the Silver Screen; they just don't work for me (I said the same thing about CHICAGO). And while I agree that this is not a musical per se, it does feature a lot of overly dramatic operatic pieces/plays, which brings me to my second point: I don't like opera. Maybe it's just me, but I just can't get into it no matter how hard I try. Thirdly, I'm not necessarily fond of period pieces, and have only liked a handful of movies of this type (most notably BARRY LYNDON and ATONEMENT). As such, I really did not appreciate this movie as much as I probably should have.Now onto the objective: The acting by F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce is simply extraordinary. Abraham (as Salieri) presents a character who is conflicted and troubled upon meeting Mozart, not necessarily because he hates him, but because he believes that God is teasing or mocking him by placing such musical genius into the hands of a disrespectful, idle, and roguish youth, while seemingly giving the pious Salieri nothing more than mediocrity. As such, Salieri is decidedly presented as the 'reluctant' villain whose guilt and jealousy and sense of divine betrayal constantly eat away at his conscience. The conflict faced by Abraham's character is evident in every scene in which he appears. Tom Hulce presents the prodigy Mozart as somewhat of a modern day 'rock star', living a reckless and carefree existence. It is a bit unfortunate that he had to contend with Abraham for the Best Actor nod, since it was a battle that he was never going to win.Biopics about artists are generally long and boring and do not succeed in connecting with the audience. This is where AMADEUS proves itself to be exceptional; it is not really a biopic and is in fact more of a story than a documentary, as Milos Forman and Frank Shaffer took some liberties with the storyline, resulting in a quite compelling story.Then there's the Music. I mentioned earlier that I am not a fan of musicals, but that doesn't mean that I am opposed to Music in Motion Pictures. On the contrary. I was quite curious to see how Mozart's music would fit into this film, and the end result was simply breathtaking. The musical pieces are not inserted at random in the film as I feared; instead each featured piece succeeds brilliantly in capturing and enhancing the overall mood evoked, and it is evident that much forethought went into the music selection.A final note about the title 'AMADEUS': this film could have been called 'MOZART' or 'WOLFGANG' or anything else that would indicate that the film is indeed about the legendary composer (as not many people knew that Amadeus was his middle name). Any student of language will know that 'Amadeus' loosely translates to 'Loved by God', and it is this concept that drives the film, as Salieri believes that God has forsaken him by blessing Mozart with the musical talents which Salieri believes he himself should have had. It is the resulting bitterness and jealousy that propel the story.This is a great movie overall, and a wonderful character study. It deserved the Best Picture and Best Director (a second for Forman after ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST) Oscars in a relatively weak field that year (1984). Nonetheless, it is just not my type of movie and I find it difficult to give this movie more that 8/10 since it would seem that I am bending to the will of other critics, influenced by the 'popular' vote rather than my own. I give this film 3.5 stars (out of 4) since I believe that as an Oscar winner it should be seen and studied. This film will garner a spot on my 'Honourable Mentions' list due to the superb acting, direction, storyline, and music, rather than to the overdone and seemingly never-ending operatic segments. Highly recommended.",8,2,3,3 November 2008
Gran Torino," A Modern-day DIRTY HARRY with racial overtones...
","When I first heard of the premise of GRAN TORINO, I was convinced that it would be a strong contender at the Oscars. I was surprised when it was subsequently snubbed, but when I saw it, I understood why. GRAN TORINO is a bit too over-the-top and predictable for serious Oscar consideration. It is watchable, yes. But is it a modern-day classic? No. Clint Eastwood's acting is good, but not great, as he conjures up memories of Dirty Harry with the ever-present scowl and occasional growl. There is even one scene where he could pass for Bruce Banner, just prior to transformation. His character arc and eventual conclusion is a bit flawed, and not well developed. There is no real progressive change, but the development takes place in stages. Nonetheless, his acting is quite watchable. I am still not quite sure of what to make of the supporting actors Bee Vang and Ahney Her. In some instance, the acting is amateurish, while in some scenes, they are rather fantastic. Their acting will likely garner mixed reviews as a result.The story itself is a good one, worthy of watching. It speaks volumes about race relationships, even if some of the events and characters are stereotypical and overdone, in an effort perhaps to engage as much of the audience as possible.Overall, GRAN TORINO is not on par with Eastwood's latest offerings. It is still a good movie, but viewers have come to expect more from his movies. There are simply too many amateur mistakes in the plot and character development. 8/10. 3 stars (out of 4). Recommended.",8,1,4,17 February 2009
Patton," Much more than another war movie...
","Those who think that PATTON was simply 'another war flick' are sorely mistaken; it is actually better thought of as one of the best character pieces of all time, set against the backdrop of WWII. While I had little knowledge, and therefore little fascination, of the man himself before seeing this picture, I finally realise and appreciate (film critic) James Berardinelli's views on the subject (N.B. Said critic lists the title as his favourite film of all time).George C. Scott delivers one of the best performances I've seen in a long time; one that has, and will continue to withstand the test of time. The final scene is relevant, well-suited, somewhat heartbreaking, and poignant, as are the final lines. That's not to say I'll be studying Patton the man in any great detail in the future, but I have gained a greater level of respect and admiration (and fear?) of the character after watching this film.It's hard to give this movie a 4-star rating simply because I can't recommend it unreservedly to EVERYONE. Having seen many WWII-based films like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, and TV series like BAND OF BROTHERS, the visual effects and dialogue seem a bit...dated. Nevertheless, that does surprisingly little to take away from the overall 'feel' of this movie in which every scene in its run-time of approximately 165 minutes seems relevant and necessary.The best movie of all time? Not quite. But very highly recommended in any case. Deservedly won 4 of the 'Big 8' awards at the Oscars, including Picture, Director, and Lead Actor. This should easily enter my Top 100 at 91 or 92.3.5 stars. 9/10. A definite must-see.",9,3,6,13 October 2008
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Excellent film...
","THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON works best when thought of as a sort of fantasy or fairy tale rather than a complex science fiction about the Chaos Theory and Time. It is essentially a heartwarming and compellingly engrossing Motion Picture that one surely has to see to believe. There is no wonder that comparisons have been made with FORREST GUMP, as they are essentially similar-type movies. THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON takes a life of its own, however, especially after the hour mark, when Brad Pitt appears. FORREST GUMP was perhaps a better film overall, but THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is more thought-provoking, and there are various hidden elements and undertones pervading the wonderful story and script.David Fincher infuses his own dark style of direction that many have come to love (myself included; both FIGHT CLUB and SE7EN feature well in my Top 20) though this may be his most lighthearted film to date. His nomination for Best Director was undoubtedly deserved.Brad Pitt is adequate but not really outstanding, and I can think of a few performances that should have been given the nomination over his. It is not for a lack of effort on his part; it's just that he lacks the requisite range for such a complex character. His portrayal of the young Button is youthful and energetic, but not as an old and experienced man trapped inside a young man's body. Likewise, his portrayal of the old Button is that of a feeble and weakened man, and not that of a young man trapped inside an old man's fragile body. The story of Benjamin Button is supposed to be a melancholy one in hindsight, and Pitt lacks that sense of melancholy that such a unique and difficult character should exhibit. His nomination did not come as a surprise but it is unlikely that it will result in victory.THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON stands a better chance of winning the technical awards rather than the acting, directing, and writing ones. The movie is simply beautiful, and should not be missed. The screenplay is intelligent and well-constructed. THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is an excellent film that warrants discussion. 8/10. 3.5 stars (out of 4). Should enter my Top 200 at 192. Unreservedly recommended.",8,2,6,17 February 2009
Pi," Proof that Aronofsky was a genius even before REQUIEM FOR A DREAM...
","It is only human nature to question existence, and to try to find some patterned order in the seemingly random chaos that is life. For Mathematician Max Cohen, the universal language of Mathematics is the only rational way to find the order in the chaos.In a wonderfully fresh and unique film, Darren Aronofsky explores the nature of chaos and one troubled man's relentless pursuit to find some answer to it all. Shot in black-and-white to give the film a more artistic impression, the cinematography is quite brilliant, as is the score, which fully conveys the overall mood of the film. Sean Gullette is perfectly cast as Cohen, and he fits into the character extremely well. Almost too well. To me the real star is an up-and-coming director named Darren Aronofsky.PI is a wonderful and freshly weird Motion Picture that will appeal to most. 8/10. 3 stars (out of 4) A marvellously ambitious effort by a director who seems unafraid to take challenges head-on. Should enter my top 300 at 264. Highly recommended.",8,0,1,26 January 2009
The Last Emperor," A unique and indispensable Motion Picture...
","THE LAST EMPEROR is a wonderful and compelling film dealing with the historic events that surround the life of The Forbidden Palace's Last Emperor, Pu Yi, in a dramatic and non-linear fashion.Those who are aware of the (hi)story will know that Pu Yi was in essence, nothing more than a 'puppet' Emperor and a tool, rather than a being of great worldly power. While he had almost absolute control of his subjects within his Empire, he was seen as more of a prisoner, involuntarily trapped within the confines of the Empire. Bernardo Bertolucci does extremely well to portray this to viewers, as there are many scenes in which viewers are made to pity Pu Yi's situation.THE LAST EMPEROR is a superb film featuring some of the best cinematography, set direction, costume design, and music of all time. The screenplay is simply magnificent, and viewers will find themselves totally drawn into the film as it progresses. The pacing of this film is a strong part of what makes it so great, as it never seems to sprawl for long periods of time. Taking home 9 Oscars (including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay) in a relatively good year for Motion Pictures is no fluke. THE LAST EMPEROR is a film that simply should not be missed.4 stars (out of 4). 9/10. Should enter my Top 100 at #98. Highly recommended.",9,0,0,20 November 2008
Shine," Quite superb...
","SHINE is a compelling and touching story about music, talent, performance, pressure, and redemption. Scott Hicks' masterpiece is difficult to summarise in any traditional review or comment because it touches upon so many facets and ranges of human emotion. It is no surprise that this tale, based 'loosely' on the life of pianist David Helfgott (I say loosely because this is by no means a strict documentary, as many liberties are taken with the script) was nominated for the Best Picture and Best Director Oscars, and were it not for THE English PATIENT, would have walked away with the grand prize.Geoffrey Rush as the adult Helfgott is amazing and his Best Lead Actor victory for his portrayal of this musical genius was well-deserved as the performance was simply breathtaking. A popular complaint is that Rush was only on screen for less than half the run-time of the film and as such should not have really won. The counterargument is such: it is the quality of the performance that counts, not the screen-time. Armin Muller-Stahl is equally impressive and deserved his nomination. My only gripe is that Noah Taylor was not given at least a nod for his portrayal of the younger Helfgott.The writing, cinematography, and musical score are top-notch and transform this Motion Picture from good to great. 8/10. 3.5 stars (out of 4). Should enter my Top 250 at 206. Highly recommended.",8,7,11,26 January 2009
The Fountain," Ambitious and ultimately rewarding, but falls a bit short of the mark
","Darren Aronofsky's name will almost exclusively be linked with the amazingly awesome REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, and in his latest offering, Aronofsky's genius once again comes to the forefront in an impressively ambitious Motion Picture that is full of atmosphere and emotion, but eventually will be described as a film that one appreciates but does not really 'like'.Part of the problem was its running length of about 90 minutes, which I felt was too short a time to convey what Aronofsky wanted to accomplish. For the first half-hour or so, I myself was unsure of what the film's overall purpose was. A lengthier, better-paced movie may have been better suited to an undertaking of this magnitude. My other problem was that the three stories did not intertwine as well as they should have at many times, and themselves felt like separate short stories.Nonetheless, I applaud this Motion Picture for its ambition, its vision, its story, its acting (Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz were quite spectacular), and its breathtaking and mood-setting score.Overall, a solid 8/10 and 3 stars (out of 4). If only more filmmakers had the vision and the drive to undertake a project of this scope. Recommended, especially for those seeking a unique, strange, and ultimately rewarding Motion Picture about the quest for Everlasting Life, and the Certainty of Death.",8,2,4,26 January 2009
30 Days of Night," Not your typical vampire horror filmand that's a good thing
","30 DAYS OF NIGHT is for those who have become fed-up of Hollywood's tendency to cast vampires as pretty-boy, emo, tortured soul types with whom the audience is supposed to sympathise. The 'vampires' in 30 DAYS OF NIGHT (at least we are made to assume that they are vampires) are nowhere near worthy of sympathy, and are some of the most horrific and frightening monsters seen on film in recent years.The movie is continually adrenaline-filled, and is paced well in order to maintain the tension. The story itself is a decent one, and while maintaining the requisite visceral appeal of a film of this nature, begs a critical question at its core: 'How much would one sacrifice to save the one(s) he love(s)?' This question becomes apparent and palpable during the last hour or so of the Motion Picture, leading to the chilling climax, which blends together aspects of beauty and of horror.The cast is adequate, and Josh Hartnett manages to shine in his protagonist hero role. Not a classic by any stretch of the imagination, but it remains to be seen whether this film will withstand the test of time 8/10. A solid 3 stars (out of 4). May garner a place in my Honourable Mention list. David Slade's follow-up to the tasteless HARD CANDY is quite recommended.",8,1,3,26 January 2009
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," An intelligent perspective of chaos, order, institutionalisation ,and freedom...
","There's a good reason why this film ranks so high on IMDb's top 250 (as I am writing this, it is comfortably in the top 10): this movie appeals to a wide range of audiences without seeming pretentious or over-the-top (save perhaps for one scene which I will not discuss here for the sake of the potential viewer).Deservedly, one of the few films to sweep the 'Big 5' awards at the Oscars, namely Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Nicholson), Best Actress, and Best Screenplay (Adapted). The film itself is worthy of all the accolades won; it sends the viewer on an immensely gripping psychological ride, with one of the best and most widely discussed endings you are likely to see in a Motion Picture. This was in fact, the very film that catapulted the legendary Milos Forman to stardom (he would later follow this up with the highly successful AMADEUS). The direction is simply superb as is the writing, and it is evident that Forman knew exactly what he wanted from the offset.Jack Nicholson wins his first Oscar in one of the best roles ever portrayed on film. The viewer will constantly question his state of mind relative to the other patients, and to the persons who society deem as 'mentally fit'. It is worth noting that Nicholson was only Forman's third choice for the lead role, after Gene Hackman and Marlon Brando. Maybe the Fates conspired that Nicholson would eventually get the nod, as it is now difficult to imagine either of the aforementioned topping Nicholson's performance.Louise Fletcher is equally brilliant, and the interaction and conflict between these two key personalities is one of the main selling points of this feature. The viewer will question intensely the ultimate motives of Fletcher's character, and this has made for one of the more interesting character studies of all time. Not to be forgotten is Brad Dourif who, in his debut performance, deservedly garnered an Oscar nomination. Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd also have small roles which they perform admirably well, but all this was before they really became famous. In fact, all the actors portraying patients do convincingly well in their portrayals of a wide variety of common mental illnesses, and the casting in this film was simply genius.For the entire running time of ~125 minutes the viewer is captivated, leading up to, during, and well beyond the ending, which is not quite cathartic but will no doubt impinge upon cerebral impulses rather than visceral. Personally, just considering the first 100 minutes or so, I would have simply stated that the film was quite GOOD; it is the ultimate conclusion that propels this film from good to GREAT; perhaps one of the best of all time. This film,like many great ones, stays with the viewer long after the end credits begin to roll.Arguably, the movie may not have aged well since many of the practices in the medical discipline of mental health have improved drastically since the late 70s. However, I find this does very little to upset or throw off the open-minded viewer.I am not surprised by this film's inclusion in the Top 10 since, as stated earlier, it has a very wide appeal, not unlike THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. Honestly, this film should not be missed, even if you have to watch it on one of the classic networks with commercials and censorship (Heaven forbid!).This film warrants 4 stars (out of 4). 9/10. Highly recommended. Should just about enter my top 100 at 99 or so.",9,1,2,20 October 2008
Downfall," Riveting, beautiful, powerful...
","DER UNTERGANG has to be one of the best WWII movies ever made, and it is unfortunate that it will not receive as many accolades as it should due to its international origin, limited release, and somewhat controversial subject manner.The film is the third of its kind to account Adolf Hitler's last 10 days in Berlin before his death (I highly doubt that this qualifies as a spoiler), and though I have not seen the previous two, I have no doubt that DER UNTERGANG is the best of the three, otherwise I surely would have heard more of those other movies.I was informed that Der Fuhrer was presented in a rather sympathetic way in this film, which was the cause of some controversy, but upon viewing I can say that nothing can be further from the truth. Bruno Ganz presents Hitler as a vile, pathetic (not sympathetic), angry, short-tempered, megalomaniacal, bitter individual whose primary beliefs are a perversion of the theory of Natural Selection: that the weak must be left to perish while the strong survive, and any assisting of the weak (and hence Humanity in general) goes against Nature. Ganz's performance is captivating, and he steals every scene in which he appears, which is no surprise given his role. His presentation of Hitler is quite easily the best ever seen in cinematic history, and he owed a lot of his preparation to listening to previously hidden recordings of Hitler in his final days, as well as studying Parkinson's disease patients.The cast, while mostly unknown outside Germany, does incredibly well, and there is no scene in which any cast member seems to falter to weaken the movie. While the film is primarily about Hitler, director Oliver Hirschbiegel has no hesitancies in broadening the scope of the film (quite effectively) to include 'bit-players', while still managing to keep the primary focus at the forefront of the viewer's thoughts. The one scene in which Hitler manages to escape the thoughts of the viewers is the bone-chilling and shocking scene coming down to the end involving a mother and her children. It is a scene that is difficult to stomach due to its subject matter and accurate portrayal; one that serves to highlight how dangerous such blind loyalties can become.The film is as historically accurate as it is beautiful. I am an avid fan of good WWII flicks, and I have to say, in terms of presentation and historical accuracy, DER UNTERGANG has to rank as one of the finest. It is an awesome character study of one of the most malevolent beings in modern history, one that makes today's terrorists and super-villains seem like naughty children who lost their playthings. This is a truly riveting and well-crafted piece of cinema, whose subject matter is treated exceedingly well.4 stars (out of 4). 9/10. Should enter my Top 100 at about 62 or so. Unreservedly recommended.",9,2,4,31 October 2008
The Reader," Fine acting, excellent screenplay, and a quite compelling story...
","Stephen Daldry's THE READER is another fine showcase of the acting range of Kate Winslet. Her performance here is breathtakingly wonderful as she manages to portray one of the most complex cinematic characters of 2008 in fine fashion. It is no real wonder she won the (long-overdue) Oscar for Lead Actress, but in my opinion, the award would have probably been more suited for her much under-appreciated work in the widely snubbed-for-no-real-reason REVOLUTIONARY ROAD.THE READER's nomination for Best Picture came as a bit of a surprise but upon closer inspection one would realise that the direction, screenplay, and story were simply top-notch. Some credit must also go to young David Kross who performed his role admirably well. Ralph Fiennes is also as solid and reliable as ever.My only real problem with THE READER was the way in which the story was told; in my opinion, there was no real need for the non-chronological, fragmented approach, as it would have been just as effective (and less annoying) if it was told in a more straightforward manner. Moreover, the film starts to lose its initial appeal after the first 2/3.While the events that occur in the last third of the film are somewhat important, they do little to progress the story. What was done in 35 minutes could have been achieved in about 15-20.THE READER is a rare gem of a Motion Picture. Worth watching even if it's only for Kate Winslet's stunning performance. 8/10. 3.5 stars (out of 4). Should enter my Top 250 at 232. Highly recommended.",8,1,2,26 February 2009
The Wrestler," Excellent character study with strong acting, and an interesting story...
","Darren Aronofsky's fourth film as director is not nearly as strange or unorthodox as his previous three, but is more straightforward, and is dependent on the story and the main character rather than atmosphere. THE WRESTLER is all about Mickey Rourke, who gives the best performance of an otherwise mediocre career. It is a performance worthy of a Best Lead Actor nomination, perhaps not a victory. Rourke portrays the aging wrestler who has lost touch with almost all humanity. He works a dead-end day job, and struggles to make the rent. All his money is spent on performance enhancers, legal and illegal. His only daughter has disowned him and his only meaningful relationship is with a stripper who is also nearing the end of her career. His other 'real' relationship is with his hordes of bloodthirsty fans.Rourke does not take the easy way out, playing the role with melodrama, or begging the audience for pity and sympathy. Instead, he is a proud man, disconnected form humanity, cut off from the rest of the world. All he knows is wrestling.The film goes to some length to give a behind-the-scenes view of mainstream wrestling. As most people are aware of by now, much of the violence is simulated and exaggerated, and most of the fight is scripted. I have long stopped watching (about 10 years now), abandoning the violent soap opera that calls itself professional wrestling.Much must also be said about a smoking hot Marisa Tomei, who is perhaps reason enough to watch the film, not only for the obvious visceral pleasure, but for the intelligent way she portrays her character. Her nomination for Best Supporting Actress was well-deserved.THE WRESTLER is a fine Motion Picture. It is still a bit strange to see Aronofsky take the straightforward route, but to his credit, it works in his favour. 8/10. 3.5 stars (out of 4). Should enter my top 200 at 173. Highly recommended.",8,2,3,17 February 2009
Blade Runner," One of the most influential sci-fi movies ever made...
","BLADE RUNNER is, in a nutshell, an intelligent and thought-provoking futuristic science-fiction film noir. Those expecting to see a typical Harrison Ford save-the-world-and-rescue-his-family film, or a typical sci-fi special effects blockbuster will be surprised, as they will not be prepared for a film with such dark and brooding undertones. For at the heart of this futuristic sci-fi thriller is a bleak and complex film exploring the darkest and most sombre elements of humanity, and questioning what exactly comprises humanity.BLADE RUNNER exudes atmosphere. Ridley Scott infuses his film with a brooding atmosphere, from the ever-crowded streets, to the giant electronic billboards, to the huge and haunting apartment complexes. The atmosphere effectively sets the tone for this Motion Picture. Cinematography and set design are almost impeccable. Even 26 years after its release, one will still be astounded by Ridley Scott's vision of the future. The electronic score, done exclusively by Vangelis, also goes to great lengths to setting the overall mood for the film.The story itself is a profound and compelling one, but it is the ending that propels this from good to great, and makes this film one of the most widely discussed and debated sci-fi movies of all time. I will not mention the questions that will be posed at the end of the film, for the sake of potential viewers (and due to my spoiler-free nature), but all I will say here is that the film is worth watching at least once, as it is a truly cerebral and rewarding experience; one which no single review can ever truly encompass.On a final note, the acting in this movie is mixed, as the cast (as an ensemble) delivers a rather varied performance. Harrison Ford is as reliable as ever, though he seems a bit out of place in a film of this nature. Rutger Hauer and Darly Hannah (neither of whom I am a fan) deliver perhaps their best ever performances in this film. The rest of the cast is mediocre to poor and not really worth mentioning.Overall, the film deserves a solid 8/10 and 3.5 stars (out of 4). Will enter my Top 200 at #195 or so. Highly recommended.",8,1,2,30 November 2008
The Thin Red Line," War doesn't ennoble men. It turns them into dogs, poisons their souls...
","In THE THIN RED LINE, Terrence Malick serves up a compelling story full of chaos and intrigue, in a visually pleasing manner, as is his artistic tendency. Many shots contained herein serve to give the viewer a 'feel' of the environment. Such shots focus on images as diverse as crocodiles, insects, dogs, streams, and hills (to name a few). The brilliant imagery leaps out at the viewer in a profound manner, to enhance the overall experience of the film.The story itself is a deep and immersive one; it is intelligent, multi-dimensional, complex, and character-driven. Malick assembles an all-star cast for this motion picture, with mixed results. Some are quite magnificent, including Sean Penn, Jim Caviezel, Nick Nolte, and Ben Chaplin. Some are mediocre, including John Cusack, Adrien Brody, and Woody Harrelson. And a couple are just plain awful (John Travolta and George Clooney), but thankfully they have very little screen time and hopefully viewers are too starstruck to notice their poor acting. They decrease the film's overall quality to some extent, but should not take away from the film itself, as it remains a gripping war movie, easily one of the best to emerge out of the 1990s.Having been made shortly after the excellent SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, this film had huge footsteps to follow, and it does so successfully for the most part. The problem is that THE THIN RED LINE falters a bit in its final quarter. The editing seems rushed, and story stumbles a bit, seeming incoherent as it rambles and sprawls. The resulting sense of disorientation takes away a bit from the film, but should not detract any potential viewers, as the film is epic in scope and content. THE THIN RED LINE features some excellent cinematography and writing. Unfortunately, it will always seem/feel like the less-favoured second child, after Steven Spielberg's masterpiece. In this case, it is not necessarily a bad thing.I consider myself to be a huge War-movie fan (and critic) and I thoroughly enjoyed THE THIN RED LINE. It deals with the terror and panic that grip soldiers on the battlefield in a refreshingly chaotic and complex way. On a side note, Martin Scorsese (possibly the best director of all time, and my personal favourite) lists this as his second favourite movie of the 1990s.3.5 stars (out of 4). 9/10. Should enter my Top 100 at #97. Unreservedly recommended.",9,0,1,23 November 2008
Pineapple Express," If it's Apatow, it's Quality...
","PINEAPPLE EXPRESS is Judd Apatow's first real foray away from the romantic comedy (if you can call his offerings by that dreadful moniker) and into the more 'male-appreciated' buddy/stoner comedy. Helmed by David Gordon Green, PINEAPPLE EXPRESS achieves what so many recent buddy/stoner comedies fail to do: make the audience laugh genuinely while not giving in to the temptation of cheap laughter.PINEAPPLE EXPRESS is full of laugh-out-loud moments and memorable one-liners, and is worthy of multiple viewings. This film is not a typical comedy; it is full of violence and crime, and has its 'dark' moments, even though almost all of these end in laughter. The bottom line is that PINEAPPLE EXPRESS never takes itself too seriously, and that is why it works so well.The Seth Rogen/James Franco duo is quite hilarious and it is refreshing to see Franco in a comedic lead role, as he does brilliantly well. My only real problem with PINEAPPLE EXPRESS is its run-time which exceeds the optimal length for a comedy by about 20 minutes; a more ruthless editor would have probably cut out large portions of the over-the-top action sequences.Overall, a solid 7/10. 2.5 stars (out of 4). Recommended.",7,7,16,17 February 2009
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Comedic gold...
","It is difficult to comment on/review a comedy flick without being almost exclusively subjective; such is the nature of comedy. Some people just don't 'get' certain comedy acts. In terms of a classic comedy-fest such as MONTY PYTHON, I find it hard to believe that people still don't get comedies that are as irreverent and intelligent as MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL. Even almost 35 years after its release, the jokes remain fresh, and while they won't bring about the same spurts of laughter they do on first viewing, the viewer will undoubtedly chuckle at various instances, out of sheer admiration.The concept of such funny and gifted comedians such as John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, and Michael Palin (all playing multiple roles) spoofing British history/legend is simply hilarious, and their thick British accent just add to the humour.There are numerous sketches in MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL that will live long in the memory, and many have seen the film enough to be able to quote these scenes, line for line.MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL is comedic genius. Simple as that. 8/10. 3 stars (out of 4). It is difficult to give movies of comedic nature any higher than 3 stars due to their subjectivity. Should enter my Top 300 at 283. Highly recommended.",8,0,1,17 February 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," It's even better than people say it is...
","It is difficult to encapsulate SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE in any single comment/review, as it is a much too powerful Motion Picture to concisely summarise, blending together so many elements of human emotion and humanity, all done in a stylish manner characteristic of Danny Boyle. It is a film that begins with quite dark elements, leading the viewer to believe that it is a film noir, but as this excellent film progresses and unravels, the viewer slowly begins to understand the non-chronological plot.The basic premise of SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is Destiny, for those who choose to believe in such things. For it is only human to embrace the concept of Destiny; that someone is truly destined for something or someone else, and that the Universe tends to unfold as it should in order to facilitate such.The cast is impeccable, as even the younger unknown actors/actresses do incredibly well. Special note must be made about Dev Patel, who it seems was born to play the lead role. He is extremely likable (almost too likable, one might say) and it is inconceivable to think that any audience will be rooting against him. Anil Kapoor is also quite superb as the game-show host, bringing a sense of deceptiveness and deviousness to go along with his charm and personality. Freida Pinto also deserves credit for her part as the eldest Latika. In all, this is quite easily one of the best ensembles to grace the theatre in 2008, and is another compelling argument (for) that Best Ensemble should be added to the Academy Awards.The story is an engrossing and uplifting one, full of redemption and victory following struggle and hardship. It is perhaps one of the most inspirational films of the decade, and of all time.As of early February, much awards buzz has been surrounding Danny Boyle's masterpiece, and it is easy to understand why people gravitate towards this finely-constructed story. I will be posting this review well before the Academy Awards, but I am confident that this film will deservedly walk away with the Best Picture and Best Director awards, just to name a couple.Unreservedly recommended. 9/10. 4 stars (out of 4). Even on first viewing, this film should enter my Top 100 at 77.",9,1,5,17 February 2009
Donnie Darko," Compelling, intelligent, fresh, and deliciously weird...
","It is difficult to place DONNIE DARKO in a particular genre; while it is hard science fiction at its core, it contains all the elements of a dark and brooding psychological thriller, done in a uniquely fresh and quirky way. It has become a cult hit over the years, especially among Science (particularly Physics) fanatics like myself. Richard Kelly in his directorial debut has created a monster here, as this film has sparked (and will continue to spark) numerous intellectual and scientific (and philosophical) debates the likes of which Kelly himself will not be able to comprehend. And therein lies the majesty of the film...My advice to potential viewers would be to obtain the Director's Cut DVD which goes some appreciable way to actually explaining the events that transpire by making references to the literature material featured in the film. The original version does very little to explain what happened and will have many viewers scratching their heads trying to understand the implications of the ending.Jake Gyllenhaal is perfect as the delusional, unstable, and troubled Donnie Darko, and after seeing this performance, it is difficult to picture Jason Schwartzman (who was originally cast) as the lead. Jena Malone and Patrick Swayze also provide useful support to our beloved protagonist. While Drew Barrymore was arguably the biggest star at the time, some of her scenes are not really necessary and take something away from the movie. In fact my only real complaint about the movie is its ~110 minute run-time; the film was in need of a more ruthless editor to cut out some of the 'redundant' scenes in order to make the movie more tense and gripping.This film is unique, compelling, smart, funny at times, and ultimately rewarding, and contains some brilliantly-used special effects to keep viewers enthralled. It is not a movie that viewers will be able to watch just once; as they will find themselves coming back to see things they missed before. In fact, Film4 lists this as one of the 50 films you should see before you die (#9), and rightly so.I give this movie 3.5 stars (out of 4) and 9/10. It should enter my Top 100 at around #94. Highly recommended.",9,1,3,4 November 2008
The Bourne Supremacy," Another lacklustre sequel...
","I'll keep this short and to the point: THE BOURNE SUPREMACY was a total letdown. None of the good elements from the original were maintained (except the acting; Matt Damon is still good, and Joan Allen and Julia Stiles do well). The screenplay is weak, the action sequences are either boring or so poorly edited they feel incoherent and nauseating, the character development/interaction is stale, the music is uninteresting, and the plot is paper-thin. It just doesn't live up to the intelligence seen in THE BOURNE IDENTITY.Yet another tasteless sequel. I was expecting more, since THE BOURNE IDENTITY was so good, but the change of director was unwarranted. Paul Greengrass (of UNITED 93 fame) feels the need to infuse this movie with needless and hackneyed action just because it falls in the genre action thriller. The lessons learnt from THE BOURNE IDENTITY's success were sadly lost. On a positive note, the final car chase sequence is worth watching because it is more engaging than the other action sequences, and because it comes at the end of the film, leading up to some closure. At the very least it's a bit of a reward for having to sit through the film...6/10 is a bit generous. If it were a stand-alone picture, I would have given THE BOURNE SUPREMACY a 5, but I still have fond memories of the original. 2.5 stars (out of 4). See it, or not. If you plan on watching out the trilogy I guess you need to see this as well, and not just the two superior ones. But be warned...monotony and tedium await...",6,1,2,26 November 2008
The Birds," Hitchcock at his finest...
","Alfred Hitchcock is considered by many to be a master of suspense, and this becomes evident upon viewing THE BIRDS. While the film itself may not be considered one of the greatest, it is a classic example of Hitchcock's mastery of the art of suspense thrillers.The pacing of this film is its strong point; it is slow and deliberate, and allows the viewer to get a better understanding or 'feel' of the lead characters. One may argue that the buildup is somewhat boring, but it is with this pacing that Hitchcock garners his accolades.Rod Taylor and Jessica Tandy perform competently well in a motion picture that drew many snickers form the 'elite' movie-going public. In fact, many dismissed the entire concept of the movie as ridiculous. For this film, Hitchcock takes a relatively unpopular premise and turns it into a classic, and that to me is the genius of the man.The special effects at that time (1962/3) were ground-breaking, and even watching them today, the viewer can't help but get the feeling that the effects take on a rather hauntingly genuine quality, one that adds to the overall feeling of tension that pervades the majority of the second half of the film.The film itself is one that will encourage viewers to use their own intellects to try to determine what really happened, and as a result many different theories and perspectives are formed. As such, it is regarded as one of the more thought-provoking of Hitchcock's classics. On that note, Hitchcock himself has never (allegedly) provided any concrete explanation for the events that transpire in this film, merely stating that if he does so the film then becomes a work of science fiction, and not a work of suspense.3.5 stars (out of 4). 8/10. Should warrant a place on my Honourable Mentions list. Highly recommended, especially for fans of the genre.",8,2,3,23 October 2008
Princess Mononoke," Perhaps Miyazaki's most powerful and epic offering to date
","Hiyao Miyazaki has gained his fame as a uniquely talented animator in Japan; one who has been deemed good enough to be imported to Western cinema. Miyazaki has also been known as a strict conservationalist/environmentalist, and this film combines his two passions seamlessly. I am aware that pretty much all of Miyazaki's films have environmentalist messages/undertones, but this one has a particularly strong and powerful meaning.As always, Miyazaki's films are catered to more mature audiences, and this one has one of the most intelligent and complex story lines one is apt to see in an animated feature. That's not to say that children will not be fascinated by the unique and flowing visuals, but it should also be noted that this is one of Miyazaki's most violent films, and contains various depictions of decapitations, dismemberments, and blood. As such, very young children may be detracted from the film, but audiences from their teens to their twilight years would find this a uniquely fascinating and rewarding movie-going experience.Thankfully, I was able to procure a subtitled version and not the dubbed one (although I am aware that the English voice acting was not as cheesy as most dubbed tiles) The main characters are quite likable and audiences will enjoy going along with them on their emotional and physical rides. Moreover, Miyazaki does not take sides, and presents the story in an intelligent and unbiased fashion, intimating that everyone acts in what they believe is their best interest.This was my third Miyazaki film and I enjoyed this even more than HAURU NO UGOKU SHIRO, but not as much as SEN TO CHIHIRO NO KAMIKAKUSHI. Overall, this film deserves a 9/10 and 3.5 star rating (out of 4). Should enter my Top 150 at 144. Unreservedly recommended.",9,0,1,26 January 2009
