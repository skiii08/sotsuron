Black Swan," Intense and gripping
","Thoroughly enjoyed this film, even after my wife said it was just about ballet!!Great acting, certainly from NP. The whole film was gripping and intense, also quite scary in some parts. Filmed through first person viewpoint in many parts it really gives you a sense of taking part and being Lily. NP's character goes through a physical and emotional journey in trying to become the 'perfect' lead role in swan lake.This journey takes her to dark and dangerous places in her mind and gives the audience an intense insight into the unsettling desire of one persons need to prove herself.I would definitely recommend seeing this film.",9,1,3,23 January 2011
