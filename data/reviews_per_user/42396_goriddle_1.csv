Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I give up on George Lucas
","George Lucas said in 'From Star Wars to Jedi', 'A special Effect without a story is a pretty boring thing.'. At first I didn't quite understand this statement. So, George humored me by demonstrating this with the Phantom menace. One big long, boring (not to mention very cheezy) special effect. The true prequels to the Star Wars Trilogy are the two Ewoks movies and the Star Wars Holiday special. Oh, I also have another message for george: I curse you with a thousand fleas for not releasing the original Star Wars Trilogy in their original form on DVD. Those little added special effects are poop!",Null,0,1,17 February 2003
