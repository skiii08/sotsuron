"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Overrated
","To me, this is just an OK film. Even after buying it on DVD, I can't be bothered to watch it twice. No disrespect to the leading actors, who all did a good job, but it just isn't very deep, moving, involving or complex.Surely the only way this film is above average is as a nice feel-good film for people attracted or entertained by the lifestyles at its core. Come on, we all know a feel-good film when we see it.. I can't see any other reason anyone should give this anything more than 5 or 6 out of 10. The plot and character development are easily outdone by good TV. For me, some of the film is patronising: the aborigines getting into the show smacks of right-on political correctness. I can't help but wonder would that happen in real life? This reminds me of when they had an old black guy dancing in a Rick Astley video, to 'show' that although Rick as a thin ginger white boy from Lancashire, working for Stock Aitken and Waterman, he was in fact a real Soul singer, as demonstrated by the way this black waiter got into the music. We've all seen this device used in lots of places (including politician's ads).There are 2 other cult films like this I've bought that have also fallen far short of their reputation: Easy Rider (dreadful rubbish), and Withnail and I (this last one is just about worth watching twice)I like Terence Stamp the best, a very dry performance - and the most convincing. Once again: not a dreadful film, but not a classic by any stretch of the imagination",5,0,11,18 January 2004
Die Hard," Good fun, Alan Rickman steals the show
","Good fun, action film, if you can suspend your disbelief. More action than characterisation Alan Rickman steals the show, but I suppose he is rather good at playing baddies!",7,1,3,4 January 2002
Braveheart," what's the point?
","what's the point of historical drama that is 80% inaccurate? you may as well just make up a story without messing up people's perceptions. I always worry that people believe these rewrites of history. There are no shades of grey here - everyone's either an angel or a devil, and there's no humour about the goodie/baddie contrast like in a Clint Eastwood western",5,3,7,4 January 2002
Gladiator," Best action film I can remember
","I can't fault this film. Brilliant photography, effects, music, acting. The only time the spell was broken for me was at the start, when Russell Crowe says 'Unleash Hell' with a proper Aussie twang.",10,0,0,4 January 2002
