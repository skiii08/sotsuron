The Blair Witch Project," Boring as Hell
","I am really surprised anybody found this lame film frightening. It was a tedious trek of a movie that really should of been twenty minutes long and slapped on as a short in front of a feature length film (hopefully one with more substance and atmosphere). Some bits were well acted, but it didn't detract from the fact the trio of actors were playing a bunch of complete gits. By the time the really limp 'shock ending' came about I was p**sed off and wanted my money back. During the film several people walked out and a lot of negative comments were muttered at the end by people all around me. SKIP IT!",Null,0,1,3 August 1999
