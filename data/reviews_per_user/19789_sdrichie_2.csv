The Sound of Music," Read my comments, then watch the movie!
","The Sound of Music will surely soon become one of your favourite things (a bit of a pun there for SOM fans!) as Julie Andrews excels in the finest musical of all time. This is a really uplifting film and is suitable for ages.The music is what makes this film so superb - it is really uplifting and beautifully composed. If you are sick of films ridden with violence, bad language and long for a good, clean, highly enjoyable flick, then the Sound of Music will be just your cup of tea.Watch it, and then watch it again and again (that's inevitable). Please e-mail me if you have any further queries.",10,1,7,10 October 1998
Patton," Cracking stuff!
",This is a tremendous achievement. George C. Scott just IS Patton and brings the great man alive to our screens superbly. Anyone who is interested in WW2 or war films at all should take the time to watch this epic.Patton certainly was a unique man and someone Scott portrays both with skill and flair. Watch it!,10,4,9,13 October 1998
