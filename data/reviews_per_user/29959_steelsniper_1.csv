Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," childish and poorly written
","george lucas must have gone senile.. or just plain greedy and stupid.my friends, this man is a crook. he stole my $10. he made a film purely for kids. it has all the aspects of a bad childrens show: colours and silly action and nothing deeper than that.i feel that if he had started with Anakin already at the age he was in episode 2, and made a more gritty feel to things the movie would have been much better. also, if he had spent a while longer trying to make a meaningful star wars script, it would have turned out much better. too much advanced tech make the 3 original films seem like they were in the past. lucas failed at his own game and i'd like to kick him in the nuts for it, cuz he's ruined my favorite movie series.",2,0,1,1 September 2004
