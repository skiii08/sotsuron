Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Directorial Masterpiece
","'Kill Bill, Vol.2' is another masterpiece by Quentin Tarantino.  His artistic application of brutal violence is mellowed by the ballet like choreography.  There are few directors who can get away with this extreme violence, and yet attract the interest of the broad public.  His cinematography is unsurpassed by most such film genre.  Uma Thurman gives a stellar performance as Beatrix once again.  Darryl Hannah as Elle is a very strong character, and she is the antithesis of what one would expect.  David Carradine portrays an intense Bill, the Snake, and it is refreshing to see him in this difficult role.  It is not a film for the weak at heart or the squeemish, however, it fulfills the complete cycle of the 'Kill Bill' story is a satisfying manner.  It is a must see for the film buff.  It must be seen on the big screen to appreciate the color and the breathtaking desert views.",10,0,1,25 April 2004
Catch Me If You Can," Well worth it.
","'Catch Me If You Can' is a well made and well acted cinema.  It is one of the better films of the year.  Handled as a comedy, it also is filled with tidbits of an historical character from the 50's who delights the audience with his enchanting smile.  Christopher Walkins is the true star of the show in his performance as DiCaprio's father.  His empathy is overwhelming and I highly recommend this movie for the whole family.  It is both entertainment and an education.",9,0,0,31 December 2002
Spartacus," An Epic Success
","'Spartacus' remains an epic success even on DVD.  It was released in 1960. This was at a time when the modern computerized imaging was not available. The mob scenes are made up of real people, and this cannot be accomplished any longer because of the overwhelming cost to the studios.  There is truly a need to see this film on the big screen.  However, with a good sound system and big screen there is adequate appreciation for the film.  Kirk Douglas plays the lead role in Howard Fast's greatest novel.  Jean Simmons plays Verinia, the slave woman with whom he falls in love.  Charles Laughton and Peter Ustinov give perfect performances as Roman senator and Gladiator school director respectively.  If one has not seen it before, it should be on their must see list.  It is a classic for all time.",9,1,3,25 June 2004
Minority Report," just o.k.
","The hype and broo ha ha were more than the actual film itself.  There is some excitement to the movie with much in the way of special effects that overwhelm the screen.  However, these special effects are not the super ones seen in the competitor cinemas this year.",6,0,1,26 September 2002
Monster," Powerful Drama
","'Monster' is a very draining drama, and it is a pleasant surprise to see such an honest portrayal of a very delicate subject.  Charlize Theron take the honors for the female performance of the year.  She gives a compelling portrayal of a mistreated prostitute with crime winding through the background.  This is another must see film for this year's oscars.",10,0,0,19 January 2004
The Rookie," long
","This Disney story is a long trying film to watch.  Despite a propensity for baseball by so many Americans, watching it in this filming borders on boring.  I felt sorry for the youngsters in the audience who were subjected to the extended story which could have been an hour shorter.  Still, Dennis Quaid gives a good performance.",4,0,1,25 September 2002
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," 'The Chronicles of Narnia', A Perfect Fantasy
","'The Chronicles of Narnia:/The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' is a perfect fantasy. It satisfies the adult thirst for entertainment just as well as that of the older child. It involves the adventures of four young siblings who enter a fantastic world of elves and witches and animated animals that engulfs our imagination. Georgie Henley plays the youngest of the troupe, Lucy Pevensie, who first witnesses the magical land of Narnia. Her initial adventure eventually ensnares the others. Skandar Keynes plays Edmund Pevensie the younger of the brothers, and he actually cinches the attraction for the older two. William Moseley plays Peter Pevensie, the eventual leader of this group of adventurers. And Anna Popplewell plays Susan Pevensie, the older and most attractive sister who is more like an assistant to Peter in their fantastic story. The music is essential and awe inspiring. The computer graphic generated animals were enough to fool me. Liam Neeson is the voice of the lion, Aslan, and he was the perfect choice for this entertaining piece. Tilda Swinton plays the White Witch and her piercing eyes and gripping expressions make her the most outstanding source of evil seen in cinema in years. Don't miss this movie.",8,0,1,6 October 2006
The Notebook," 'The Notebook' is a touching love story.
","'The Notebook' is a touching love story that should not be missed.  Jame Garner gives a remarkable performance as Duke the aging husband.  Ryan Gosling gives a convincing performance as the younger version of Noah Calhoun, a lumberjack who falls in love with a wealthy girl.  Sam Shepard too gives a stunning portrayal of Noah's father, Frank Calhoun,  in this cinematic treat.  It is filmed in photographic perfection with color and scenery that is totally in keeping with the story itself.  One becomes engrossed with the passionate relationship of Noah and Allie.  The essence of total dedication to one's spouse is the thematic conclusion.  I can recommend this picture to anyone with a dramatic sense of humanity.  Even the music is adapted well to the screen.  The casting is remarkable.  It is a must see movie.  Don't let it slip by.",10,0,0,4 July 2004
Spider-Man 2," 'Spider-Man 2' is another thrill ride.
","Tobey McGuire gives another thrilling performance as Spiderman.  This is the second installment, and it is definitely not disappointing.  Alfred Molina plays Doc Ock/Dr. Otto Actavius is a very convincing manner.  His computer generated tentacles surround one with the evil that he exemplifies. Rosemary Harris plays May Parker, the doting mother of our super hero, and she is involved is some pretty good trick photography that is genuine at least to the audience.  There is a brief performance by Cliff Robertson as the endearing uncle Ben Parker.  Wilem Dafoe also makes a brief entry as the villain from the first installment of this epic cartoon drama.  It is definitely one that will please audiences young and old.  The special effects are worth the price of admission.  The sound effects too are well suited to the cinematic experience.  It is a must see movie for this genre of flicks.",8,0,0,4 July 2004
Brokeback Mountain," Superb Lovestory
","'Brokeback Mountain is a superb love story. It is a dramatic tragedy that is compelling in performance as well as in its cinema. The photography is panoramic. The acting is tender and dynamic at the same time. Jake Gyllenhall plays Jack Twist. Heath Ledger plays Ennis Del Mar. The two seek work from Randy Quaid who plays Joe Aguirre, an overweight manager of a large herd of sheep. As sheep ranchers the two of them spend lots of time on Brokeback Mountain to the point that they fall in love. Larry McMurtry's screenplay comes to life in a vivid way that may have shocked yesterday's moviegoer. However, the director, Ang Lee, has composed a masterpiece in that the scenes between these two are both believable and tastefully done. Even the music is coordinated to enhance the film, and the nomination for an academy award as best picture is relevant. I can highly recommend this movie. Put it on your 'must see' list.",10,22,25,29 March 2006
Insomnia," Fair, but not an eye opener
","Despite the hooplah, I found this one of the mediocre films of the year so far.  It does hold ones interest, however, it is predictable and somewhat boring.  Al Pacino is aging and not as facile in his performance as he has been in the past.  Robin Williams, the villian in this movie, is playing well but it too is not his best performance.  Perhaps his next film out now has a slight edge on this sleeper.",6,0,0,29 September 2002
The Prestige," The Prestige is Superb
","'The Prestige' is a superb drama. It represents the struggle between two masterful magicians in London. Hugh Jackman gives a superior performance as the tall handsome Robert Angier. And Christian Bale plays Alfed Borden, the counterpoint in this exciting and slickly done cinema. Scarlett Johansson is the younger attractive blonde wife, Olivia Wenscombe, who assists in unraveling the competitive nature of the constant battle. One is particularly impressed with the cinematography and muted color that only enhances the enjoyment. The young daughter, Sarah Borden, gives an adequate child performance as the fulcrum of Christian Bale's plight. And last but not least is Michael Caine's portrayal of Cutter, the magic show manager who weaves this tale in a suspenseful fashion to the delight of the entire audience. It is a remarkable film that is likely to be a top contender this year.",10,3,6,11 November 2006
The Bourne Identity," excellent
","The Bourne Identity is an excellent film, but not the finest movie of the year.  It has redeeming qualities in the action scenes, and even though they are unbelievable, they seem logical for this picture.  I went away with a sense of money well spent.",7,0,1,26 September 2002
Cold Mountain," Accurate Adaptation of the Novel. Bravo
","The screenplay adaptaion of the novel, 'Cold Mountain', is perfection similar to that of a prior masterpiece, 'To Kill A Mockingbird'.  The cinematography is breathtaking, and the acting is genuinely believable. Honest moviegoers should put this on their 2003 list of Academy Award Winners.  Don't miss it.",10,1,1,28 December 2003
Little Miss Sunshine," 'Little Miss Sunshine' is the brightest film this year.
","'Little Miss Sunshine' is the brightest film so far this year. It is a comedy that had me laughing and crying simultaneously. Abigail Breslin plays Olive, the charming daughter of a most dysfunctional family. Dr. Phil would be extremely challenged by this group. Greg Kinnear does another masterful job in his portrayal of an inspirational speaker, Richard, with somewhat less talent at accomplishing this feat at home. He is perfect in this part. Paul Dano plays Dwayne, the silent brother who is rebellious and introspective nearly throughout the whole movie. His Tee shirt is a scream, and his silence is golden. Toni Collette plays Sheryl, Richard's wife, and she too gives an outstanding performance. Alan Arkin is perfect in his portrayal of the Grandpa with a spark for his granddaughter's talent, yet an extremely comical attitude that permeates his character in his inimical way. Lastly, Uncle Frank is played by Steve Carell, a suicidal, gay man who is brilliant and intense in his role. Don't miss this sun-shining film. It is masterfully done and will grab your heart and your funny bone at the same time.",10,1,4,16 September 2006
The Alamo," Billy Bob Triumph
","'The Alamo' is the most accurate depiction of this historical event in years.  The Billy Bob Thornton performance is the zenith of the movie's strength.  His portrayal of David Crockett is worth the price of admission. It places the previous actors, Fess Parker and John Wayne, in a cartoon like, position in this dramatic role.  One must see this film on the big screen to appreciate it's panoramic impact.  Much of the action takes place in the Alamo itself, however, there is the extra benefit of the battle that took place at the San Jacinto Battle grounds.  I found it a refreshing presentation of this film genre.  All of the performances were deeply felt, and Billy Bob's is especially outstanding.  Dennis Quaid as Sam Houston also turns in a remarkable performance.  This was a long awaited movie, and well worth the wait.  Plan on a long film.",7,40,52,25 April 2004
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," '40-Year Old Virgin' is an adolescent comedy.
","'40 - Year Old Virgin' is a slapstick comedy that will definitely entertain the adolescents in the crowd. One should be warned that every other word is the 'F' word or something similar. However, it is rated R and therefore entertaining to the younger folks without reservation. Many of us older fogies got a lot of belly laughs as well. John Stewart gave it a good review on his Cable Network show 'Comedy Central', and the plug was well taken. One should not expect to see an academy award winning performance by anyone, but give it a chance and have a great time at the movies. It is clearly understood now why it this cinema has done so well at the box office. It may prove to be a rental success as well. I gave it an 8 purely out of infantile entertainment value. See it. You'll like it. Dale Haufrect",8,1,2,7 November 2005
Spider-Man," special effects worth it
","Once again, Hollywood has displayed special effects that are greater than the film itself.  No classic film here, but one that is definitely worth an afternoon at the pictures.  The cinematography is superb.  The scenes swinging from building to building is challenging to the imagination.  Great show for the youngsters.",8,0,0,26 September 2002
Jarhead," Exciting War Movie
","'Jarhead' is a very exciting war film with realism that boggles the mind. It is well done and because of the violence should not be recommended for a family outing. Jamie Foxx gives another superb performance as Staff Sgt. Sykes. He is rough, touch and brutal in his necessary treatment of the marines in his outfit. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Swoff, the new recruit who suffers the indignation of most all marine recruits and he gives a very believable performance. The cinematography is brilliant. The color is intense and it is especially magnified by the fires set to the oil wells by Saddam's madness. I give this film a high rating. It came as a surprise to me in that I had little knowledge of what to expect. It is worth a day at the movies.Be sure to see it on a large screen with a good sound system. Dale Haufrect",7,2,5,6 November 2005
Seabiscuit," Excellent Film
","'Seabiscuit' is a worthwhile cinema in the must see list for fans of this medium.  It is filmed with great talent, and the costuming is remarkable as are the props.  The older automobiles from the early 20th century are true to life.  The horse racing scenes are dynamic and breathtaking.  Jeff Bridges does an underplayed job of characterizing the intriguing protagonist.  In fact, the entire cast does an admirable job.  The color is eye catching.  The horses are beautiful.  One should definitely add this to their list of flicks to see.  The academy awards ceremony did not place enough emphasis on this picture.  One cannot complement it enough.",9,0,0,7 April 2004
X-Men: The Last Stand," X-Men: The Last Stand stands alone.
","'X-Men: The Last Stand' stands alone in film computer animated technology. Few films feature the technology above substance, however,this movie does so quite successfully. Ian McKelen gives a convincing performance as Magneto, a changeable evil doer. Hugh Jackson plays Logan, Magneto's arch enemy and savior of the 'force' in Star Wars terms. Halle Berry is Ororo Munro or storm who is the Marvel character with intense eyes and magnificent beauty. She gives another adequate performance in this, one of her lessor films. Josef Sommer plays the United States President as he has in prior works. He adds another consistent role to his successful list. Patrick Stewart plays Professor Charles Xavier in a very intense way that literally burns his character into the cinema. He too is convincing. Aaron Stanford is John Allerdyce or Pyro. His youth and energy are dynamic. Shawn Ashmore is Bobby Drake or Iceman with equal dynamism. However, the true star and the only one worth mentioning in this movie is the technical support provided by the computer animation which allows us to appreciate the story in a way that we could not only a very few years ago.",7,0,1,25 June 2006
Ghostbusters," Belly Splitter
","This 1984 comedy is a real belly splitter.  It is worth renting again and again, and it is suited for the entire family.  Harold Ramis, now of even greater fame, is hysterically funny.  Rick Moranis is the penultimate accountant.  Bill Murray does an outstanding job as the mad but charming scientist-scholar of ghostly apparitions.  This is a must-see film along with all of the other productions of these comedic geniuses.",10,0,0,30 December 2002
K-19: The Widowmaker," cramped for two hours
","I doubt that most moviegoers will desire to have this one in their disc collection.  It was like spending two plus hours in a dark closet and nowhere to turn for relief.  The acting is weak, the cinematography is likewise.  To obtain a better picture of this semirecent incident, one is much better off seeing the documentary on the History Channel.  I gave it a 3 and felt strongly about it.",3,6,11,29 September 2002
The Illusionist," Terrific, and that's no Illusion.
","'The Illusionist' is a terrific film. It is no illusion to the audience to appreciate a work of art such as this. Edward Norton plays Eisenheim, the Houdini of his time. He is convincing in the role, and very adept in captivating his actor audience as well as those in the cinema. His eyes are piercing. His gesticulations are perfection. Paul Giamatti stars as the Chief Inspector Uhl, who unravels the mystery with an energetic stance. Jessica Biel plays, Sophie, the lovely heroine responsible for the tricky plot. I prefer to allow the film going public to absorb the story on their rather than spoil any of its finely tuned twists. One cannot become the least bit bored because the attention is constantly on the slight of hand of the magical hero. Don't miss this movie. It is a real winner. And that is no illusion.",10,5,9,11 September 2006
Children of Men," Not for Children or Men
","Alfonso Cuaron has directed a futuristic movie with great actors and a weak story. 'Children of Men' has great stars with talented actors and little substance. Clive Owen gives one of his less admired portrayals of a British gentleman who is caught in a web of intrigue that takes place 20 years from now. Julianne Moore plays his ex-wife. She too is a wasted talent in a film that does not benefit from the display of military might. Michael Caine emulates a typical 1960's aging hippie with flowing gray hair. He is very convincing as an hallucinogenic abuser with a deep affection for his demented spouse. There is a frenetic chase by the state, and it is a nightmare that is repeated ad nauseam. I cannot recommend this film, and I cannot understand it's popularity among the viewers. Take it off of your list of films to see unless there is nothing else to do.",2,14,23,5 February 2007
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Great Work of Art
","'Kill Bill:  Vol. 1' is a great work of art.  Despite the violent theme, it is a ballet in cinema.  The color is vibrant.  The use of black and white photography is very well adapted.  This technique helps to subdue the extreme violence toward the end of the movie.  Uma Therman is magnificent in her portrayal of a young woman with revenge on her mind.  Her ability to perform the marshall arts is remarkable.  Her eyes are piercingly blue, and her emotional presentation is perfect in her role.  There are scenes that are totally done in cartoon, and this too helps to allay the fears of the violent episodes that frequent this cinema.  One must add this to their library of great films.  This director is a true genius.  If you have not seen it on the big screen, the DVD is perfectly well done.",10,0,2,23 June 2004
The Last Samurai," Another Must See Film
","'The Last Samurai' is a cinematic triumph.  It is beyond one's expectations of a great movie, and I found the packed audience totally glued to the entire picture.  Time flew by with no relevance, and I place this in the Academy Awards category without question.  It is a must see film.",10,1,2,28 December 2003
Up," 'Up' is up, up and away.
","'Up' is well worth seeing in 3D. It utilizes the polarized glasses that were first released in 1952 with the black and white film, 'Bwana Devil'. However, this cartoon has enhanced the quality of presentation with effects that were unavailable in the 1950's. The storyline is one that is bent more toward the adult, and true empathy for the characters is unique to this film. The kids may enjoy the special effects and cartoon animals, however, the adults will appreciate the kind and gentle approach to the elderly that is a welcome change in the cartoon world. Edward Asner is the perfect voice for the protagonist. And Christopher Plummer is pleasure to listen to as Mr. Charles Muntz. I highly recommend this film for old and young alike.",10,1,3,11 June 2009
The Red Violin," Outstanding Cinema Experience
",'The Red Violin' is a cinema to be remembered.  It captures the imagination from beginning to end and rivets ones' soul with pristine music of unequaled quality during the performance.  Samuel L. Jackson gives a unique although brief performance as one of the bidders for this instrument. I can highly recommend this classic feature.,10,0,0,4 February 2003
Inside Man," An Outstanding Episode of Excitement
","Spike Lee has directed an outstanding film that is filled with excitement. It is a story of a bank heist that supersedes all prior films of the same genre. Denzel Washington plays detective Keith Frazier who is assigned the job of cracking this case. His rival is Clive Owen who plays Dalton Russell, the gang leader who has taken over a major bank in New York City. Christopher Plummer plays Arthur Case, the CEO of the bank whose character is complex and challenging to the viewer. Jodie Foster plays Madeline White, a politically correct liaison to Plummer's character, and she is very convincing in this role. Wilem Davoe is Captain John Darius, and his performance is slick even though is is a minor one. This film will leave you breathless, and don't bother to guess the plot. It is a gem of a film and one of Denzel's very best.",9,2,3,29 March 2006
The Da Vinci Code," A Secret Code with a Punch.
","'The Da Vinci Code' is an excellent film with a really suspenseful punch. Tom Hands plays the lead role of Robert Langdon, a professorial role for him in this adaptation of Dan Brown's extremely successful novel. Audrey Tautou plays Sophie Neveu the fictional descendant of the Messiah. She has a charming screen presence and gives a very convincing performance. I found the part of Sir Leigh Teabing to be a most eloquent portrayal by Ian McKellen. He gives an electrifying performance that truly ignites the story. The photography is perfect under the direction of Ron Howard. His incorporation of the scenes and architectural sites in France and England are brilliant and cleverly woven into the theme. This cinema has the intrigue and energy of a James Bond thriller coupled with educational spots that titillate the imagination. Dan Brown's book has been given good justice by the director. It is more than worthwhile and meets all the expectations of the several months of hype that we have heard.",10,0,5,19 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Great Fantasy
",This continuing fantasy is the zenith of children's entertainment.  It continues to thrill audiences in a pleasant manner.  No doubt Alan Rickman continues to shine in his role.  Richard Harris does an outstanding job. The casting is brilliant.  The stage business is perfect and the special effects are overpowering.  I can highly recommend this one and suggest that one bring a child for that extra added pleasure of seeing them enjoy themselves.,10,0,1,9 December 2002
The Departed," 'The Departed' is an outstanding addition for Scorcese
","Martin Scorsese has succeeded in creating a masterful thriller in his recent release of 'The Departed'. Jack Nicholson does another piece of perfect portrayal of Frank Costello, and underworld villain whom one loves to hate. Matt Damon is a cop who becomes an undercover agent on the dark side named Colin Sulivan. He too gives a thrilling performance and he leaves no stone unturned. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Billy Costigan the 'good guy' cop with a distorted childhood. Martin Sheen is Oliver Queenan, the lead cop in the Boston patrol who organizes the sting, and gets tied up in his own plot. Alec Baldwin is the chief police officer on the Boston team in charge of the hunt for Costello. There are few moments that lack suspense, and surprises are abundant. It may be a bit too violent for the young, however, the violence is well performed and tastefully fits the tone. 'The Departed' is a must see movie for 2006, so be sure to put it on your list now.",10,0,1,13 October 2006
The Terminal," 'The Terminal' will remain just that.
","'The Terminal' should remain a terminal for an inept work by master artists. Tom Hanks is adequate in his portrayal of a lost Russian soul in the JFK Airport Terminal.  For such a great artist, this is a real come down.  It is an even greater come down for the exemplary director, Steven Spielberg who has created a real dud.  The concept is cute, but the film is long and tedious.  The relationship with Catherine Zeta Jones is tenuous to say the least.  It is testing one's imagination to find some sense of possibility in it, and leaves one wondering why it exists at all.  Stanly Tucci plays a humorous airport security chief who bungles it all.  But even his adequate performance fails to save this tragically insipid work.  It has hype, but is is definitely one to miss.",Null,0,0,28 June 2004
The Shawshank Redemption," Outstanding Film
","Recently on cable television, this classic movie has stirred the hearst of many.  It is a very compelling film, and it arouses one's emotions to their zenith.  The casting is perfect, the performances are the penultimate of theatre, and the result is a must-see drama that belongs in the DVD library of all serious collectors.",10,0,0,26 December 2002
Signs," very good, but not great
","This film was a very good science fiction thriller, but it is not a great movie in the sense of a classic.  There are terrific moments of suspense. The music in the soundtrack creates a sense of excitement that enhances the film well.  The child acting is superb.  Mel Gibson does a fine job, and he is worth seeing.",8,0,2,26 September 2002
Click," 'Click' is an Adolescent Flick
","'Click' is truly an adolescent flick. It stars Adam Sandler as Michael Newman. Newman is an architect who is more closely tied up to his job than to his family. His wife, Donna Newman, is a very pretty sight and is aptly played by Kate Beckinsale. Christopher Walken plays Morty, a peculiar electronics salesman at Bed Bath & Beyond. He provides Newman with a universal remote which truly is universal. David Hasselhoff plays John Ammer, Michael's boss who is overbearing, and gives a comical performance. The bits are predictable, and there is much very adolescent language and gestures that appeals to the children in the house, but it is an ephemeral chuckle that one mostly hears in the theater. This film can be missed without much concern.",3,2,13,24 June 2006
Gangs of New York," Good but not Great
","This film is advertised as an epic, but it is more of a bloodbath in the streets of Old New York.  Leonardo DiCaprio does an acceptable job in the heroic role.  The absolute winner in this Scorcese film is actually the cinematography, done in a muted, foggy fashion throughout the movie.  This cinema is not as 'good as it gets'.",7,0,0,31 December 2002
Windtalkers," good
","Only a 6, but a very good film for it's historical value.  The blood and guts is stretching ones ability to watch gore to the utmost limits. However the drama and the storyline are very redeeming and worth seeing.  Nicolas Cage does a powerful job.  The supporting cast is also highly qualified.",6,0,0,26 September 2002
Gladiator," A real Epic
","'Gladiator' is a film of epic proportion.  Russel Crowe gives his academy award performance, the first of a probable long list of awards for this talented superstar.  The DVD is particularly entertaining in that it also shows the making of the film and much of what was left on the cutting room floor.",9,1,1,30 December 2002
V for Vendetta," A Political Fantasy of Magnanimous Proportion
","'V for Vendetta' is a political fantasy of magnanimous proportion. It definitely highlights the incredible talent of Natalie Portman. She plays Evey who is challenged by V from beginning to end. There are scenes in this movie that remind one of 'The Matrix'. There is also a scene that is very similar to the style of the fight scenes in the 'Kill Bill' series. Although this is a fantasy, it has deeper social and political meaning. It takes place in London, and the sets are spectacular. One should, however, take particular note of Portman's talent. She dominates this movie with her deep introspective gaze, and her performance truly makes this movie a sparkling one. It will prove to be an adventure for the older as well as younger crowd, so don't miss it.",10,1,3,29 March 2006
