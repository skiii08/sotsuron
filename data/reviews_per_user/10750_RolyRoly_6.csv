Moneyball," The business of baseball
","There is no question that Moneyball should immediately be elevated to the already crowded upper echelon of baseball movies, but it is really more about business than it is about sport. The storyline is already familiar, and the good thing about it being, as they say, 'based on a true story' is that we are spared a Hollywood ending in the form of a 7th game, extra innings victory in the World Series.Moneyball is a classy production from start to finish. The script is tightly written, the casting is impeccable and the direction is slick and largely unobtrusive. Brad Pitt is competent in a role that doesn't demand too much of an actor. Philip Seymour Hoffman looks every inch (or pound) an old school baseball manager in his exasperated attempt to impose the 'right way' of doing things on the hapless misfits he has been given to lead into battle. Stephen Bishop is a remarkably fine David Justice, the former superstar trying to come to terms with the vagaries of ageing and fading acclaim. The real star, though, is Jonah Hill, who, as a precocious young math whiz, and an Ivy League grad to boot, is a fish almost completely out of water amongst the cynical old guard of the baseball world.It is a fine film, to be sure, but if there is any justice come Oscar time then at least two other films which were also featured this week in Toronto, The Descendants and The Artist, should be the front runners for best picture.",8,5,10,14 September 2011
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," A landmark and a masterpiece
","Among the manifold injustices in the history of the Academy Awards are the facts that Dr. Strangelove did not win for Best Picture and that Peter Sellers did not win for Best Actor for any one of his three (and it could have been four) roles. Much as I enjoyed Rex Harrison in My Fair Lady, and even recognizing the narrow-minded conservatism of Hollywood in 1964, it is a gross indictment of the Academy. In fact, Sellers should have won for both Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor, such is the magnitude of his accomplishment here.I first saw this film in 1968, when I'd just turned 14. I can't count the number of times I've seen it since and, now that my own kids have come to recognize that Dr. Stangelove is the greatest comedy ever filmed (City Lights not too far behind), my work here is done.",10,1,2,7 September 2014
The Artist," Marvellous; one of the best movie experiences you'll ever have
","The Artist arrived at the Toronto International Film Festival preceded by the accolades it received at Cannes, so expectations were high, but those expectations have been more than amply fulfilled. This film is an absolute marvel - charming, witty, surprising, moving, clever and beautiful. Filmmaking is about decisions, thousands and thousands of them, and everyone involved in The Artist makes every decision to perfection. The cinematography is ravishing in luminous black and white. The musical score, on which the film, being silent, is so dependant, is subtle when it needs to be subtle, dramatic when the occasion calls for it, and never overbearing or overwrought. The screenplay (yes, silent films do have screenplays) toys with the conventions of the silent era, paying homage to some of the greatest films of the first two or three decades of cinema history. The acting is flawless, extracting emotion and humour from a simple but classic storyline. The direction displays such self-assurance, and treats the audience with such respect, that it is almost like having a dialogue with the director.The Artist is one of the most enjoyable movie experiences I have ever had. It deserves a wide audience and all sorts of awards. I can hardly wait to see it again.And oh yes, if there is ever an Oscar for best animal performance, the dog in The Artist should receive a lifetime achievement award for this role alone.",10,306,430,11 September 2011
Moonrise Kingdom," (Very) old-fashioned comedy
","Whenever I see a movie that I truly admire I always like to look at the most negative IMDb reviews before posting my own. In the case of Moonrise Kingdom it is apparent that Wes Anderson is very much an acquired taste. Many of our greatest artists are.It's interesting to see so many people who don't regard this as a comedy simply because (it seems) it isn't paced like a Judd Apatow movie. Without trying to sound too pretentious, Moonrise Kingdom is a comedy in the Shakespearean sense: more Midsummer Night's Dream than The Hangover.Anderson has an extraordinary ability to turn the most mundane subject matter into a magical, even mystical experience. The story here is simple, but the treatment captivates the viewer (well, many of us anyway) because he approaches the story with such a unique combination of innocence and style. Every shot in Moonrise Kingdom is designed to dazzle us visually. Yes, it is calculated and the acting can appear stilted, but there is simply no one in modern cinema whose vision is as clear-headed.In some ways Anderson is to comedy what Hitchcock is to the suspense genre. Every frame (or pixel) is the emanation of a unique personality. We should be grateful that there remains a place for such filmmakers in a world where individualism has a difficult path.",8,1,2,23 November 2012
50_50," Time for an Oscar Do Over
","In a just universe, no one would get cancer and 50/50 would have been nominated for at least four Oscars: Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress. Why does it matter? It doesn't; or at least it shouldn't. But Hollywood owes it to the future of the industry to support slightly daring and off-beat films like 50/50 rather than smugly liberal (and covertly racist) movies like The Help or yet another Tom Hanks or Brad Pitt star vehicle.For anyone who has had to deal with cancer themselves or in a loved one (and sadly, that probably means most of us), you owe it to yourself to see this wonderful film. When she heard about the subject matter, my wife refused to see it, having just recently lost her sister to the disease. It took me months to persuade her and she is now so taken by it that she's talked about little else since.I assure you that, despite what you may think, you simply don't know how you're going to react to news like that received by Adam until you actually receive it. Posts on IMDb complain that he didn't cry enough, to which I have just one response: it's a two hour movie that covers a year in his life but the film chooses (very wisely) to focus on the many other ways in which he contended with his diagnosis. That is what makes this film such a joy to watch.Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anna Kendrick are so beautifully cast that it is like that were made for these roles. Still in their 20's, at first neither of them - neither the patient nor the 'expert' - fathoms that the world can present such difficult challenges. They're young, they have good jobs, they have good friends and are going to live forever, aren't they? Neither one has ever experienced deprivation or hardship.I think part of the reason why Hollywood has had a hard time with 50/50 is that it doesn't fit neatly into any of the boxes that the industry machine has created. It was marketed badly and inaccurately, largely, one suspects, on the basis of that fact that Seth Rogen is in it (and he's very good, by the way). It deals with a subject that instinctively makes the audience uncomfortable, and it plays on that discomfort in an original way, without ever exploiting it.An 8.5.",9,0,0,21 February 2012
The Martian," Been there, seen that
","I am mystified by the overwhelmingly positive reaction that this film received, not only among moviegoers but critics as well. To be sure, Matt Damon is his normally engaging self, to the point that, if it weren't for him, The Martian would be almost unbearably tedious.Let's start with the fact that there is really no dramatic tension here whatsoever. Was the fact that the stranded astronaut would be heroically rescued in the last five minutes ever in the remotest doubt? This is a Hollywood movie, after all. Sure, there is the usual internal dissension - heartless management vs. compassionate colleagues. We know who is going to win that battle. There is Mark Watney's ongoing struggle to stay alive, through an increasingly unbelievable series of stratagems, despite things repeatedly blowing up around him, all the while making endearing wisecracks (for the most part to no one in particular).The special effects are pretty good, though nothing that is much beyond what Kubrick was able to accomplish almost half a century ago.The script has a few bright moments, but is so replete with clich√©s that it frequently verges on parody. The cheering crowds in Times, Trafalgar and Tiananmen Squares, the ubiquitous CNN news feed, the 'unconventional' but brilliant young NASA engineer/math whiz who saves the day (along with the Chinese, this being 2015), the selfless, bantering and bonhomie among the properly gender-balanced crew of astronauts, the hard-ass 'suit' who runs NASA and runs up against the 'old guy' who has one last act of defiance left in him - and on and on and on. Really, there is not an interesting or nuanced plot twist or character among the lot.I wanted to like this movie, mostly because, despite its thin story, Blade Runner still holds a special place in my heart. But I do now understand why Ridley Scott didn't get his Oscar nomination for best director.",4,2,5,19 January 2016
