Blade Runner 2049," An absolute masterpiece
","It is often asked: what are some of the best film sequels? You used to get answers like The Godfather Part 2, The Empire Strikes Back, Toy Story 2, and so on. Well, Blade Runner 2049 simply shattered all my expectations when I saw it opening night in theaters. I've never had a cinematic experience so fulfilling.Truly, Villeneuve knocked it out of the park.",10,3,12,11 February 2019
Black Panther," Ignore the haters-this film holds its own
","After years of the same Marvel movie over and over (aside from a couple slight detours), Cooglar has managed to meaningfully evolve the Marvel formula. Black Panther is alive and fresh. The villain is brilliantly developed and actually inspires change in our protagonist (good writing 101). The visuals are wonderfully lush and varied. I've seen it twice already. This is a film worth rewatching.",9,3,7,25 March 2018
