Sucker Punch," This super-punching sucks
","I've never, but never, wrote review to put down some movie, but I have to do with this one. First, beginning of the movie. I was like, oh my God w** - music was epic fail, scenes were barely bearable ... I don't know. Whoever gave an idea for this beginning, I suggest him to jump off bridge or something. Second, acting. Oh my, oh my ... I've seen better acting at amateur theater with kids of age 8 acting ... There was no willingness in their acting, it's just plain and stupid, no offense. It's like putting Barbie into hell and watching her escaping ... pinky boring. Then, plot. Honestly, I was a bit confused with all that alter-reality because I'm a guy of one world, not tons of them. However, I handled that somehow, and continued watching. Oh my, oh my ... how much I regret. She enters some sort of Japan-style temple or tomb or whatever and meets some wired guy who gives her gun and samurai sword and tells her to find out her freedom. Then she returns to reality, suddenly starting to speak much more and being more friendly. Then there pops out idea about escaping : finding a map, setting whole place on fire, finding a knife and a key ... Oh my, oh my ... Don't get me wrong, I'm not feminist and I don't hate movies with girls fighting for something they believe in - but this is lame. I haven't even cared for a girl ... I did not cared if she was raped, if she was sent there without a crime; I do not care, it's just plain. Then I kind a stooped watching movie and turned on music on my earphone. It was real pain in the a** watching almost 2hrs of nothing but suffering for my ears, eyes and my entire body. This movie brings nothing new, it just waste 2hrs of your life. At the end, some short version :+ I liked big guy with machine gun. - Everything else. Friendly advice : Stay away from this movie !",1,5,12,15 April 2011
The Hunger Games," Bad ... just ... just bad
","When I heard that there's going to be a cinema release of 'The Hunger Games', I was really excited (as many fans, really). Casting seemed kinda appropriate, even though not perfect. I believe they should cast actors of the age as represented in book, not any other. Beginning was ... okay. I guess. They drill us in by few slides of the basic explanations of everyone who hasn't read the books. However, everything from that on goes downhill. At least 80% of original scenes from the 'Tributes' part of the book were either changed or left out completely. She buys the medallion on the market instead of being a gift from a friend. Peeta's father never visits her, giving her promise that he'll watch out for her sister. Haymitch is nowhere until the train scenes. I mean, his failure of drinking problem is NOWHERE NEAR AS POINTED OUT AS IN BOOKS. I like the actor they cast for him, Woody, my boy, but they just don't give him an opportunity. There's no chemistry between characters, actress who plays Kantiss is just staring here and there like a dead seal, without any acting whatsoever. Actor who plays Peeta might be even worse. There's simply no connection whatsoever between them, no chemistry - before or during the arena. For everyone who has read the books, Ru's death was one of the most emotional scenes in whole book. In movies they scavenged it to 30s scene without any emotion whatsoever. It's like watching that dude who died at the first step in arena being buried - no one cared! Jokes were plain, not well executed, Kantiss's absence of water was never portrayed (as if she instantly found the water), scenes in the cave were empty, without any emotion whatsoever, scene where Tresh spares Kantiss was plainly retarded as if he had the eyes over the arena and saw what she did for Ru ... I can't begin to describe the enormous burden I bared during the movie time. They almost destroyed the book for me. I can bet up my house that (if anyone ever decides to make it) this will be the easiest movie to make parody of (maybe just above Twilight) simply because they thought they can make it to look better in the books. They ruined great R+ books and dug them down to the PG+13. I mean, seriously? There's like three drops of blood in the entire movie. Main actress looks as if she ate her whole life ten meals a day, not starved for half of her life. She doesn't lose weight in arena, no, she actually gains it. I can go on and on about the flaws of the movie, but I think this is enough. I'm just hoping someone will remake it in the future and make it ACTUALLY R+ because that's what it is. It's not a freekin' teenager drama but the movie about survival and overcoming the tyranny that was put upon them.They even put president as if he was nothing. Just a dumb guy. They added a 'bonus scenes' so we can see what's happening 'behind cameras'. Oh God ... even special effects looked as if the movie was made in 2000thish. Seriously movie makers ... if you can't do your job properly, don't do it at all.",3,7,8,29 July 2012
The Notebook," The forgotten way of romantic movies
","I have watched The Notebook at least four to five times for only one dull reason : To return the faith of love within my emotionless heart. Yes, even tho people are denying existence of cold-heart, it does exist, indeed. However, this movie, at least for a one moment, returns the faith of the kindness to me, and I am thankful. The Notebook sets story of two young in love, fighting against those who do not believe in the bond between the poor and the rich; 'He's a good boy, but he's not for you.'Based on the book by Nicholas, they actually adopted movie at their best. Movie does what no other romantic movie of now-days does : It returns faith to our hearts; faith of the kindness that truly exist in each and every human being, even tho that kindness is lost deep because of the coldness and cruelness of the world. It could be said that this movie has a elements of fantasy, classic fairytale; yet it's not. It is possible for the love to win everything if it's real - it is truly the greatest weapon among all.I've said a lot, but nothing about the movie itself. Well, movie is, if not the best, in top 3 romantic movies ever made. Plot, acting, dialog, chemistry ... It stars with beautiful view upon the sunset and the lake; it truly starts magnificently. 'Do you want to dance with me ?' - so honest and respectful, so innocent and naive, yet so honorable. I could've never think of myself that kind a approach to the girl I'd sometimes like. Movie really brings an truthful picture of love, kindness, struggles, rewards, hate, naivety and honesty, and the rating does not do the justice to this movie. When I see which movies take top 10, I feel sorry for all living; even tho I am living.If you didn't watch, watch, you won't regret for a second.",8,0,1,30 May 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," We're close to epic ending
","While watching movie, in few places I had doubts about this movie. Not that movie ain't great, but that many scenes that were actually important to movie story were cuted out and few that actually don't matter nothing were included. Take example of Kreacher's story, and the scene when Harry and Herimiona dance in the tent (actualy, that scene is never written in book). So, what's more important ?! To see their knowledge of dancing, or to understand Kreacher's life (actualy, when Kreacher crush down on the ground of being overwhelmed with happiness was one of most emotional scenes in the book). That's one minus. Then, the story about entering the Ministry was, softly said, terrible. I mean, in one moment they realize that they should go to Ministry, and in then they're there ... However, when we throw away these few misleads in movie, we get one great movie that warms us for epic finale that will cast out the mightiness of the Harry Potter to maximum. Still, I'm a bit afraid of the things they might throw away in second part. Movie doesen't follow the book at every way, which is a bit disappointing if you ask me (no matter if movie would be 3hrs, every fan of Harry Potter would watch it and eat every word - and I seriously doubt that they had money problem), but act in the movie was really great, so as the effects were (not that there are really much of them, but personally I liked that flight-fight scene, no matter that even that scene was cuted out a bit), and there were some moments when you could really laugh no matter that you know that that will happen. After seeing the end of the first part, which came too fast (I mean, they put 500 pages into 143 minutes, by cutting out some main parts of book and adding some really crappy scenes), I realize that movie wasn't that bad; however, my hope still lies in second part, which I hope will be like 'really-really better'. Last 200 pages of book wouldn't be hard to put in some 2h'n 30min movie, but we will see.Waiting June 2011 with hope beyond known; Harry Potter franchise will end like it deserves : Epicaly !",8,0,0,24 November 2010
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Expectations weren't high ENOUGH
","I was a mere child when I watched LOTR franchise and I still liked it. Ever since, year by year, I grew fonder and fonder of the movies and they remain, and probably forever will, one of my favorite movies of all time. I've read all the books countless times (including Hobit) and when I saw that Hobbit was coming into the cinema, my mind was entirely wiped away from its existence due to excitement that entered me. Now, movie review. As expected from Peter - almost flawless masterpiece. Given that he had a lot of material to work with, I imagine it was quite hard to put everything together for the scenery - yet he did it, once more. He captured the feeling of the book and transcended it onto a screen; of course, it was not solely his credit, to not be mistaken. The acting was amazing - perfectly fitting into fantasy style. The chemistry between actors was more than just the obvious - you could actually feel their interactions and live the story. Yes, it was that good. I have no need to begin writing about camera work and all that comes with it; locations were beautiful, effects and colors were mixed perfect, a soundtrack that followed through pattered with what was going on perfectly ... it is really one of those moments when you simply can't say enough because you know, regardless of how many words you put in, you still won't be able to describe things the way you felt them. I have only one thing to say: congratulations Mr. Jackson and rest of the cast.The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey will become classic without any doubt; I am just glad that I got to be a part of the generation that witnessed the never-dying franchise of Mr. Tolkien's work.",7,602,1165,8 December 2012
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Fairly good
","* Might contain some spoilers * I don't know if they're connected, but I watched another movie where Apes are controlling over humans. It was amusing but unfortunately I forgot the name.However, Rise of the Planet of the Apes is an well-acted, scripted and produced movie; definitely better than any other movie that went out through summer break.It brings action, emotion and rips everything good out of it rolling it in one nice slice of almost 2h fun. It is filled with humor, irritating characters, good-bad (black'n'white) characters, fairly noticeable soundtrack, well done CGI and above all amazing acting. Franco(Will) brings out everything that his character is. An deeply committed and caring son with only one goal left within his life : to find a cure for his father. Set aside of it, he creates visual chemistry between him and Cezar(ape) that small amount of actors can do. From first look, I didn't see mayor flaws in his acting but it was probably because I had kind a low expectations for this movie since I'm not huge fan of Sci-fi of last years.Going on with actors, Freida(Charoline) was okay, surely could have done better job, but she was mostly shadowed by others so maybe she didn't get enough chance. John(Charles) nailed this movie. I mean, I'm familiar with him as an great actor and one of my favorite roles was the one in Dexter where he plays serial killer, but this brings out the other side. Playing an character that requires to perform an mental illness and to convince audience that you actually possess that illness isn't easy job but he pulled it out throughout to the end. He's an amazing actor and I hope to see more of his work in the brief future. Others were mostly just follow-up actors, but I kind a liked David(Steven) and Tom(Dodge) following up. David played an standard corporate drug seller whose only goal is to find a way to get more money and he pulled it off. As for Tom, he get used to play a role of the bad guy so he stood quite a good out there, guarding chimps and torturing them now and then.Movie is a worth watching and gives you brief moment of fun but it won't last long in your head. It's like FAF - you see all the action once, it's not fun seeing it again.",Null,1,2,19 September 2011
How to Train Your Dragon," Remarkable animation movie
","The story evolves around Hiccup: young, insecure want-to-be dragon hunter whose only cause is to impress his father and make him proud for slaying a dragon. That being said, movie reaches far from that.When you're creating one animation story, at least over the course of past several years, you see one grand opening with either background story or action ripping in. How to train your dragon brings kind a both. It sucks you into the story of present and past right in and you already know you want to keep watching it.Without further due, animations are mind-blowing. Characters are relentless; they're so different from each other that you begin to wonder where the heck could they meet each other. But, after all, it just clicks. The whole concept of characterization just fits right in with the whole concept of story. Writers were well aware that one slight miss-course off of the plot would lead to an entire disaster and they focused their full attention on unraveling the story by unraveling characters. They both dwell through same course of actions; as the story develops, so do the characters. They're colorful, funny, 'wisdomous', caring, patient, loving (sometimes annoying, yes) that you just have to fall in love with them. I actually read few reviews that are stating that this movie is unoriginal: for God's sake it's based on the book! On the book! On the bestseller book! The story IS original. But, seriously, if you're going to make a movie about dragons, how much originality you can pull off in that area? The bottom line is: Movie is amazing! It's one of those movies you can watch with your wife, kids, parents, girlfriend, brothers, sisters, friends ... it's filled with comedy, 'cute action', few drama moments and nice, captive ending to all of it. It produces one nice message by the end and I know that anyone who watched the movie felt something by the end. I, honestly, can't wait for the sequel and I hope it'll be at least as half as good as this one - even if it doesn't, I will enjoy it for sure.",10,1,1,29 May 2012
Thor," Thundered me away
","I went to watch this movie with two friends after I saw trailer (which was too late for premiere, but at least I got it to watch in cinema) and I was blown away. Of course, it was not something that will be the crown of the world for a long time, but it is something you enjoy in the very moment and afterwards. First of all, effects. I mean, it does not do all to film, but it IS first thing you notice among all others. It's truly epic, and there's no other word to describe it. Amazing fight at almost very beginning, and so on, brings things to really new level. Going on, acting. I was really unfamiliar with Chris Hemsworth (Thor) and Tom Hiddleston (Loki) but they brought characters to life, and I mean it. I mean, it does not happen very often that some acting blow me away, but this did. I just assume that they used given chance, brought up epicness of the story, and did the best they could - it was great. I didn't doubt in Natalie Portman and Anthony Hopkins performance, and they showed me why.Going on, story is quite well presented on screen. I was never actually fan of Marvel's strips, and I'm not very familiar with many of them, but as far as other reviews, they did amazing job. This epic story is not something that will teach you valuable lesson in your life, but it will return the betrayal lesson you all should have in your minds. It is not, also, film that will stick into cinemas for a half a year or something, but it is definitely film that will provide great time watching it with friends. There is a lot of humor, which is by the way really good, and scenes that will make you think about things you've never taught before. I gave 8/10, and I think that this IMDb ranking does honor to this movie.",8,3,5,7 May 2011
The Fountain," A journey to finding yourself within and back
","You can love or hate this movie - it's simply enough. There's no between. It's been almost 6 years since movie release, and I watched it few days back after my friend gave it to me on DVD as a gift. This is my thanks to him. I love you man.Whatsoever, movie is not a love story as sold as in today's world; it is not a love story that have two characters who fight each other and at the end they realize it was all worthless and they live happily ever after. This movie is journey; journey to find yourself, your doubts and fears, your passions and what you really are. As far as my eye can see, this is one of the best love stories ever, even if focus isn't fully on the love story. Story is more realistic than 99% of the other 'romantic' movies. However, through the film we follow three parallel worlds, three parallel totally different stories, yet so similar. A man who's afraid to die and who search a way for eternity is not a man; it's just a figure that will lead a man to final knowledge - there is no eternity. Acting in this movie was beyond acting. Forget all world-wide famous actors and actress - Rachel and Jackson are two actors worth remembering. Their performance made this movie even better than it is. I often just leave my 'review' on films I love, because I think that if I don't like something I cannot judge it. But that's just me ... As I said on very beginning, you can hate or love this movie. This is not a movie filled with actions or scenes that will scare the s*** out of you or something like that - this is movie that will emote emotionless man if he can understand the whole concept in this movie. These types of movies have been forgotten and that's what bothers me most. As as 16y old kid as me, you assume that I hated this movie because I love to see killing and stuff; no, hell no. Maybe I am different, maybe I am not - I don't care. I prefer reality above fantasy, for reality this is. Don't be fooled by the space and the flying bubble - those are just elements to make this movie better; this movie is reality of death, life and loss, and how we should embrace what life brings, for all that life brings we cannot just ignore. The movie is full of passion, provoking thoughts and ideas - and yet it's so simple for people who're not blinded by what is sold today. It is not just a love story between two people, it's a story of human itself, about how we accept what will come, today, tomorrow or after ten, fifty or hundred years. As the one of final quotes in movie is 'I'm going to die' says, we are going to die - and that's what bothers most our population, humanity indeed. Without doubt, masterpiece. It should be in top5 movies of all time; it is, but those blind wouldn't allow.",10,1,2,4 April 2011
The Green Mile," Masterpiece
","I understand that this is just one of dozens of reviews already, but I just had to write it. I was like 14 years old when I saw movie first, and two years later (now) I saw it again. Of course, emotions after movie are way different. Two years ago, I was laughing aloud after movie saying 'What a waste of time' now I'm saying 'What a masterpiece!'. 'Why did I have to kill God's miracle ? Because it was my job!'It's not the right quote from the movie, but it's something that made me cry. I won't spoil the end, however, but I must say that this is the movie, along with few others I won't name, that has the greatest character development ever. Each character brings something unique to the movie, making it even bigger than it already is. The movie will always stay in my heart as a reminder that sometimes wrong calls must've been called.",10,1,3,28 January 2011
The Blind Side," Something refreshing
","As to young minds, this movie wasn't anything special; there was no action, no killing, actually, nothing worth watching. However, I'm not as most of the young minds, so I found something worth watching and giving 10 this movie.I've never been a fan of a long movies, but this movie made me think of that. Through whole movie, I haven't even notice how much passed; I was so focused on what's going on on screen rather than when the movie will finish. It takes a lot to impress me; I do not dwell in the corner where a little thing is most satisfying, rather where only things worth smiling to are smiled to. I must also say that I wasn't much of a fan of Sandra so far, but her acting in this movie was really amazing. What I like most is a plot. Plot was written almost perfectly, as plot should always be written, no matter what. It's a life drama, uncommon to the world because of the people's grief; however, it's refreshing to see that there are, out there, still people who fight for justice and who want to change the world.But, the best of all was Quinton Aaron. As an actor I've never heard of before, he really amazed me with his performance. Not just that it was stunning, but it was true; it was like he IS living the story - it was the way all actors should act. I've liked mix of comedy and drama, some scenes that shows us what life really is and yet some to show us that what we saw isn't totally true. Of course, all actors did their roles, but Sandra and Quinton as Anne and Michael did stunning job. I've never seen such a chemistry between two people that aren't in love, that aren't actually related to each other in any other way that just knowing each other, I like the moment when Michael says 'I don't like to be called Big Mike' - it really shows how is he closed within himself - that nobody actually knew that he does not like to be called Big Mike. Or the moment he says 'I thought I'm already part of this family'It is really hard to put some scenes before others because I think that movie wouldn't be what is without every scene in it. Hopefully I did not spoil anything. And, I actually don't understand why does this movie have such a low rating - yes, 7.6 is low. It is much better than Dark Knight, Ineception or whatever. Looks like people prefer fantasy and crime above truth and reality. And we wonder why are we at place we are.",10,0,2,2 April 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The film that shall never be forgotten
","*CONTAINS VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF Spoiler, GOOD TO GO*I've read most of the 'hated' 'reviews' for this film, and it all comes to one : Movie ain't created by the book. For God sake, do you depend so much on the book that you can't even enjoy movie that's been updated a bit ? No, movie does not follow the books and I'm glad it is that way. For all movies that are created according to the books I watch very beginning and very ending. If those are the same, movie will burst into my heart like a bullet from the gun. I understand how someone felt after watching the movie and not seeing every single scene from the book in movie, or even those who were a bit edited, but you must understand that this is movie of epicness and that those little details who were missed out of book will never crush him down. Peter Jackos, along with all film crew, created something worth watching even ten years after that. I've seen all three movies like tons of times, and I watch them each time with full passion and will to see what will happen next. No matter if I know that Aragorn will become what he is meant to become, I still watch the movie with hope that Aragorn will become what he's meant to become. Not knowledge, but hope.I haven't read all Tokiens books, so I cannot judge fully, but there isn't film whos inspiration was book that's fully made by same. If that's the way then it's better to just read the book. It's all same, and book costs about 50$ and movie creation 200000xxxxx+. You all need to look further than just shell of the movie. Movie represents book as much as it needs. Taking all details from the book would be just stupid, because it's not that ALL DETAILS have some important role in what will happen next. The Return of the King is a broughter of the epicness to the movie plot, and even after almost ten years of it's creation, I could not find a single movie that can compare to it (expect, of course, FOTR & TT). No, Avatar does not own the spirit that this movie has. In Avatar it's all about fantasy, fighting with nature against machines, while in ROTK story goes from character to character describing their paths and their desires. Story is much more than destroying ring. It's about willingness to sacrifice, friendship, love, passion, devotion, selfishness ... Actually, if we look that way, Avatar takes many 'ideas' from the ROTK and indirectly making this movie a big influencer. However, this is not review about Avatar, so I will stop here.ROTK is final and the greatest movie in trilogy. It combines great acting, directing, script, visual effects, breathtaking battle scenes and final victory of good. For me, probably, this will stay favorite movie forever, till the very day ground warp off my body and everything that's left is a single bone. 'The Road goes ever on and on Down from the door where it began, Now far ahead the Road has gone, And I must follow if I can, Pursuing it with eager feet, Until it joins some larger way Where many path and errands meet. And whither then? I cannot say.'",10,0,1,6 January 2011
In the Land of Blood and Honey," Should be better
","As one review stated, the movie isn't completely honest. I'm a war child from Bosnia and truth to be told, reality was far more different than the one showed in the movie: it was worse. Still, the movie is pretty good with really nice acting and solid plot. I liked camera work a lot and the message of the movie (which is not strong enough but ... well it's still there) You should not be carried away with emotions since I didn't and I lived to tell the story of a war. There are far better movies about war in Bosnia (No man's land, probably the best) but since this is Angelina's first movie as director, it is not that bad. Check it out, it might surprise you...",6,99,349,25 December 2011
