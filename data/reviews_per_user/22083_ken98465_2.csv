Ghost," Bad Writing, Bad Acting, Bad Directing, Good Righteous Brothers Tune
","This is one of those movies that you feel like you SHOULD like.  It's so noble.  The scenery and special effects are quite good.  But in the end it is just another mediocre movie starring Patrick Swayze. I don't like dramas that rely on characters doing the stupidest possible thing in order to keep the plot moving. I liked Demi Moore's performance (perhaps because her character is most sympathetic), and Tony Goldwyn gives a good effort, but Whoopi and Swayze's scenes made me cringe (particularly the bank scene). 5 out of 10",5,2,8,23 April 2000

","That Thing You Do is not deep or 'important'.  It doesn't have a political slant and it doesn't make us angry or worried or self-righteous. It is simply a wonderful movie with a great soundtrack, and one of the few movies that is for everybody from 3 to 93.  I gained a lot of respect for Tom Hanks' diverse talents because of this movie.  All of the actors do well (watch for Charlize Theron in an early role as Spartacus's girlfriend) , and they have a cute script with which to work.  That Thing You Do is as good the fourth time as the first.",10,0,0,24 April 2000
