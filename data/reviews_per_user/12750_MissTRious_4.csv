The Blair Witch Project," Oh dear, what a disappointment !
","I think the most horrify aspect of this film was the cost of admission to the Cinema. I found it rambling, pointless and predictable. I must salute the creators for the wonderful hype and mystery that really was a work of art !To say the characters were 2 dimensional would be to reward them with too much depth. Three US college kids were always going to find it hard to connect with a UK audience but these three managed to make it damn near impossible!The ONLY time of tension for me was the un-steady-cam run from the tent into the dark, but 5 minutes does not make a suspenseful movie.Anyway, I was very disappointed with the film in general and the end in particular. Just one final point, why didn't they just follow the river ??????",2,1,3,1 November 1999
Constantine," Not bad for the uninitiated
","The eponymous hero of the piece John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) walks the line between Heaven and Hell, trying in his own way to tip the cosmic battle towards the light. Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) crashes into his world after the suicide of her deeply devout, yet disturbed identical Twin sister Isobel.On the story, I'll write no more as being a spoiler junkie myself I have ruined many a film by reading the synopsis/ending before watching a single minute, and also I am sure greater minds than mine have outlined it more succinct terms than I.My comments on this film come from a relatively uninitiated point of view. I knew nothing of John Constantine before the release of this movie and to be honest I would not have looked at it if the actors involved had not interested me.Keanu Reeves has always been on the receiving end of criticism, but lets be fair to the guy He has been around for quite a while now and, although he is no Tom Hanks or Harrison Ford, I don't see his star fading anytime soon. The John Constantine he portrays owns a lot to his Matrix Neo (in my opinion) with the ascension at the end providing some Matrix III deja vu shivers. He is cold, emotionless and distant. He is dammed and so wishes not to communicate with mankind in general because he knows his fate unlike the rest of us poor souls. I like his character and his portrayal of the situation. Rachel Weisz's character is not given room to do anything. I must admit I read the novelisation before seeing the film and missed the background scenes used in the book to flesh out Angela and her sister. Saying that, this was an OK film for her but I feel she could have been given more room to make an impact.Over all, I liked this film. You like, you don't there seems to be no halfway house and makes no difference to me. All I would suggest is that if you liked it, read the book it will make you appreciate it more.",8,3,6,24 November 2005
The Sixth Sense," So much better than Blair Witch
","I will confess from the onset that I am a Bruce Willis fan, there I've said it and I'm glad I've said it. The reason for this admission is that I was biased towards this film prior to seeing it.However, this film well surpassed my little favouritism. I found it to be pacey, tense and heart-warming. Willis is wonderfully understated and Osment is fantastic. The interaction between the characters flowed well, and the twists were excellently done (especially the video tape !)All in all a value for money film with a little for everyone. This will definitely be joining my video collection when released on sell-thru !",10,0,0,18 November 1999
The Matrix," Quick Opinion
","This was an awesome film.  I saw it twice and loved it more the second time. The premise was original, the casting spot-on and the special effects breath taking.  I must admit that if Star Wars had come up against this film I feel Star Wars wouldn't have done so well at the box office.  Go and see it on a large screen if possible or even on a small screen if you have missed the cinema releases.  This film screams out to be experienced !",Null,0,0,23 September 1999
