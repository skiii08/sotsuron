Lucky Number Slevin," This movie was great
","I do not know what are you people thinking but this movie is one of those action drama movies that stands alone. I say because I saw it and I admit that the movie went great with its story line. Even the script oh the script I can't help but be impressed with the words being said by the cast. The whole cast was great including Bruce Willis, Josh Hartnett, Morgan Freeman, and Ben Kingsley. Hell it came close to Pulp Fiction but not that close. Morgan and Ben did great as the rivaled gangsters 'The Boss and The Rabbi.' I thought it most impressive with the way the camera work went through the story. Now this movie was great Action Drama. If you don't think so, you can kiss my ass.",8,1,7,19 April 2006
The Great Dictator," This from a man who what was going on in the world
",I have to say for a man like Charlie Chaplin the role he created for himself which was a Hitlerlike character who we hated at the time ended up being one of the funniest roles he had and a very bold move to do in a time of Nazism. I say Chaplin was a true American because he has been witnessing a lot of atrocities in his time he had to show the truth of what is going with the world. He was a Jew who transported himself to America to do what he loved; performing for a crowd. Every emotion he had Chaplin put in his movies. Every problem we have in America he protested through cinema. No one should comprehend of what Chaplin in his lifetime and if anyone read his book or see any of his movies you would I am talking about.,9,1,3,16 May 2006
Hero," The Best I have see with Jet Li
","I admit there are a few aspects of a film that can make us ask ourselves about defining oneself. After I saw Hero, it turned out to be everything I didn't expect in this film. The way the mood of the film is heartwarming. No one can ever create another film such as this. I don't know why a film like this was never shown before but it is truly a masterpiece and a must see. Great martial arts and great acting from the cast. If I ever meet the director, I would clearly bow down and be honored to meet him. Anybody who reads this should really see this film because no matter what others say about the film, don't listen and see it for yourself. No one should say it is bad film because they have to prove it first.",Null,1,2,1 December 2004
Fantastic Four," Mcmahon and Chiklis rocked
","I have to say that the movie was good. I admit there are some flaws that many people would have noticed including the acting. Gruffold as Mr. Fantastic tries to keep steady with his role as the famous leader especially being overly analytic with Science. Alba on the other hand tried but not that well because The Invisible Woman is the one who keeps the team balanced and getting along but ends up being the woman stripping naked in order to get through the crowd. Evans, MY GOD, the Human Torch is known to be a hot head but this guy was a hot head either way, stubborn and stupid. CHiklis did a great job acting as the THing because he showed that being ugly as he is was not easy because heroes come with different looks. McMahon also did a great job being the scheming and very manipulative villain whose intentions are to gain more power. I thought it was good because of the action and the way the whole cast bonds but the way ends was bad enough.",6,3,6,19 November 2005
