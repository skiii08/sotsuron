Requiem for a Dream," A Piece Of Art
","I am a big fan of Movies.I can smell a good movie from miles,i was surprised when i found that this movie'Requiem For A Dream'is in the list so i decided to download it.I discovered it was a rare piece of art has the great camera angle of Hitchcock,the hard work of James Cameron,the surprise of Spilberg a real dream.when i finished it i went silent for about 20 minutes i was amazed by the great plot and the tragic ending which made me of course cry.Jared Leto's ending which was from my opinion the easiest one even made me cry.it's not only about drug addiction but about lots of types of addiction diet pills TV a real modern piece of art so i want to thank Mr Darren for allowing us to watch a real and a great story and changing all our thoughts.",10,1,2,15 April 2011
Kick-Ass," good superhero
","an amazing movie i thought it was gonna be some kid's stuff but i must admit that it was one of the best movies i have ever seen. the sound was incredible, big return for Nicholas cage after a series of bad movies {knowing,bad lieutenant} and a long list of another . he regained the 90s Nicholas cage the man whom we saw in face/off and con air. about hit girl i have to admit that i have never heard of her but her fighting style and the action was good . mark strong comes to impress me after (SHERLOCK HOLMES) ouch, i forgot the hero kick -ass who was good. the visual effects were good . is there anyone who knows who is the girl that performed the role of KATIE .THE SONG IS AMAZING HEAR IT GUYS",7,4,14,8 May 2010
