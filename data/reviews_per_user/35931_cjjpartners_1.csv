Blade Runner 2049," Bad, what else can you say
","Worst movie I have ever seen. No plot. No character development. No redeeming qualities at all. I sat in the theater for almost three hours trying to ascertain what was happening. In the end, I was just glad it was over. Thank goodness I was in a theater where I could order beer, and lots of it.",1,13,27,11 October 2017
