Hereditary," Terrifying
","Before I start talking about the movie itself, I want to give a little insight on who I am just to show how scary this movie really is. Every day is Halloween for me. My bedroom is full of giant Halloween props and decorations that people are terrified of. People constantly ask me how I even sleep at night. I constantly surround myself with all things dark and creepy because its what I enjoy. I even make horror films myself. I'm also 15 years old. Now, with that in mind, please note I do not get scared easily because scary things to me are like family. Yet, this movie had my heart racing. Before you watch the movie, do not see the trailer. I watched the trailer and couldn't stop laughing because I thought it looked so bad. It actually became a joke at my house we would go on and on about and make clicking noises everyday. My original intention to see the movie was to see how bad it would be, because the trailer looks so stupid. But, after seeing the movie, I'm actually really glad that I went. This is probably the scariest modern day movie. Now, I wouldn't listen to the critics who say it is the modern day equivalent to The Exorcist. No horror movie out there can ever top The Exorcist. However, this movie is frightening. If you have seen the trailer, when you go in to see the movie, disregard anything you saw on the trailer, because this movie is much more than it appears. It doesn't use jumpscares at all, which is great, because this movie actually uses real fear. It makes you scared by wondering what will happen next, and if it can get any worse than it already is for the family. It draws you in to the point you don't want to stop staring at the screen. My only complaint about the movie is the ending scene. I think if they would have done the scene properly it would have worked, but the way that it was narrated and portrayed takes away from it. There is one part of the last scene that is really scary, and if you see the movie, I'm sure you'll know what I'm talking about. This movie is full of suspense and mystery that keeps drags you in and keeps you staring at the screen because the real secrets to the movie aren't revealed until about 15 minutes from the end. The rest of the movie doesn't really have any hints at all to what's going on, which just leaves you in confusion, which is what you want from a horror movie.",8,4,8,18 June 2018
Coco," One of the Best Disney Movies Ever
","Coco is absolutely amazing. Honestly, it's probably one of the best Disney movies ever created. The music is great, the animation is stunning, and the characters are amazing. The story follows a young boy named Miguel on Day of the Dead who wants to finally pursue his dream of becoming a guitarist just like his great grandfather, Ernesto De La Cruz. But when he tries to barrow Ernesto's guitar from his burial site, Miguel is transported into the land of the dead where he needs to find Ernesto so he can have his blessing to get back to the land of the living before sunrise. The story is so compelling and has you intrigued through the entire film. There wasn't a second in the movie that I could take my eyes off of the screen because it was so good. I especially love this movie because I love Halloween and this movie is about the afterlife. Even if you aren't seeing the movie for the death aspect, so may other things can draw you in, such as the lessons about family and always needing to remember one another. Really an amazing movie that I wouldn't mind watching over and over again.",10,0,1,29 April 2018
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Best Movie Ever
","Ever since I was very little, this has been my favorite movie of all time. I absolutely love Halloween, it's everyday for me, and this movie is, as many would probably argue, the most classic Halloween movie of all time. Not only that, but it can also be watched at Christmas time, though I see it as more of a Halloween movie because even though there are Christmas scenes and the movie takes in November and December leading up to Christmas Eve, with only the first portion of the movie being on Halloween night, even the Christmas scenes in the movie have more of a Halloween vibe to them than Christmas. The movie follows Jack Skellington, the king of Halloween, who after years of the same routine of scaring people, gets tired of this and finds out about Christmas. In his efforts to celebrate Christmas in Halloween Town, instead of celebrating it in a joyful way, they turn it into a fright filled holiday. The stop motion animation is outstanding in this movie, as well as the displays. Each Holiday Town shown in the movie, Halloween Town and Christmas Town, capture the feelings of each holiday so well. Christmas Town is very bright, happy, and joyful with many stripes and bright colors. Halloween Town has a very dark, depressing, and eerie vibe, with oddly shaped gothic buildings, tombstones, and lots of blacks, greys, and oranges. The music in this movie is also amazing. There is only one true Christmas song in the movie which is 'What's This' song by Jack Skellington when he discovers Christmas, but it stills helps establish the feel of Christmas time very well. There's many bells, harps, and other light hearted music in this song. All of the other songs in the movie are Halloween songs, and they are amazing. They each have very dark and creepy sounding instruments used, such as violins, cellos, saxophones, and other instruments of that matter. This movie is an absolute must see for any Halloween fans or anyone looking for a great movie to watch around Halloween.",10,1,1,29 April 2018
