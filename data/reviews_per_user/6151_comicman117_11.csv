Source Code," Engaging Film (some spoilers)
","Source Code (2011) directed by Duncan Jones (moon), written by Ben Ripley. Starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Monaghan, Vera Farminga and Jeffrey Wright.Now let me start by saying that I had no idea what I was going to get when I saw this film. Was it going to be a mindless thriller-action film, or was it going to be much smarter than that. To be far it's very smart (even though the IMDb list it as an action film, it's actually low on action but that doesn't matter), but maybe that's just me.The plot basically involves a young man named Colter Stevens (played by Gyllenhaal) who awakens on a train and discovers that he is living the identity of a school teacher. The person sitting next to him named Christina (played okay by Michelle Monaghan) thinks he's crazy when he tells her that the train is going to explode. The explosion happens and Stevens wakes up in the cockpit where he meets air force captain Colleen Goodwin (played by Vera Farminga), who informs him he is inside the Source Code, which is an experimental device created by Dr. Rutledge (played by Jeffrey Wright). This device allows a person to experience the last eight minutes of somebody else's life. Stevens is informed by Goodwin that he can not change the past and save the lives of the people on the train in his own time, but if he can identify the bomber in the alternate time line millions of people will be saved. As such Stevens enters the train to find out who the bomber really is.Source Code is a very well done film. The directing by Duncan Jones (who also made the masterpiece moon) is first rate. The script by Ben Ripley is extremely crafty. The acting is mostly good (especially Jeffrey Wright who I think gives the best performance in the film, as a somewhat crazed doctor).Definitely worth a look.9/10PS: Anyone find it weird that Russell Peters is in this film.",Null,0,1,23 September 2011
Gravity," An visual marvel and an intense thriller
","Alfonso Cuar√≥n's gravity is a gripping thriller that manages to pull you in (the tagline of the movie is Don't Let go). Gravity is a film that also takes advantage of its 3D. A film that for its short running time (90 minutes without credits) manages to scare me more than most recent horror movies I've seen. The film is real, and it's not afraid to show that.The plot follows Dr. Ryan Stone a bio-medical engineer who is on her first shuttle mission with veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky (who is on his last mission before his retirement). While on a spacewalk out, disaster strikes after a space debris from Russia causes a chain reaction of destruction, and they have to abort the mission. Things get worse when they lose contact with mission control. Left alone with just each other Stone and Kowalsky have to make it back to earth before they get sucked into the endless void of space.The first fifteen minutes or so of gravity, is quiet, its just Bullock and Clooney talking to each other. The action kicks once their attacked by the space debris from Russia, and things get interesting. The plot of Gravity is very intense. I haven't seen a movie in a while that's gripped me as much as Gravity did. This is a serious story Although it's not the best female performance I've seen all year, Bullock is quite good. She manages to convince me that she really is lost in space, and I also felt for her character. I imagine if I was drifting in space alone, I'd probably go berserk, but Bullock as Ryan Stone manages to keep her cool, and her character progresses throughout. She starts out in the film panicking and screaming, but by the end she manages to keep her cool and I honestly believe she's stuck in space and trying to find her way home. George Clooney is basically playing himself, and he doesn't have a whole lot of screen time (this is essentially a one woman show, might have spoiled it for anyone who hasn't seen the film), but he's still fairly witty and manages to give some pretty decent one-liners.The visuals are in Gravity are amazing. The opening shot of Earth is beautiful (or as the film likes to put it 'breathtaking'). The cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is spectacular. We really get to see space, and the planet. I don't think I've ever seen a movie that showed space and earth quite as good as gravity did.The 3D in Gravity is excellent as well. While Gravity is post-converted 3D, it's not the usual post-converted 3D crap we're used to seeing. This is a film that uses 3D to its fullest. For example when the ISS (International Space Station) explodes several parts of it come flying. I ducked my head more than ten times, despite the fact that I was aware that it wasn't real. But that's how real the 3D in Gravity is. I highly recommended you see it in that format.Gravity is an intense thriller. It's not a blockbuster, but it doesn't need to be. It's a film that doesn't have much of a soundtrack (and the soundtrack, however short it may be by Steven Price is beautiful), but it doesn't need one. Its runtime is short (90 minutes including credits), and it moves at a brisk pace. This is a movie I highly recommended you see.",10,3,7,8 October 2013
The Adventures of Tintin," Steven Spielberg goes all out for the Adventures of Tintin
","The Adventures of Tintin (2011) directed by Steven Spielberg, screenplay by Steven Moffat, Edgar Wright, and Joe Cornish. Starring (voices by) Jamie Bell, Andy Serkis, Daniel Craig, Nick Frost, Simon Pegg, Daniel Mays, Gad Elmaleh, and Toby Jones.Even before any real footage was shown, I knew that the Adventures of Tintin was going to be well done, because it wasn't done in live-action. I don't think the concept of Tintin would work all that well in live action (the French already tried this, and those films are not very good from what I've heard). Additionally Herge himself approved of Steven Spielberg, saying before his death that if any director could be perfect at making a Tintin film, that Spielberg was the one.Thankfully I got exactly what I wanted, because the Adventure of Tintin is a great adventure film, based off one of France's most iconic characters.The story combines three Tintin stories (The Crab with the Golden Claws, The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham's Treasure), and puts them into one film. Tintin (played by Jamie Bell) a reporter (not Belgium for any fans who interested), stumbles upon, and purchases a model ship called the Unicorn at a market stall. Tintin becomes interested in it after the mysterious Mr. Sakharine (Daniel Craig, completely unrecognizable) wants it. Eventually Tintin finds himself embroiled in an adventure to find out about the secrets of the Unicorn.The Adventures of Tintin is a film using motion caption (a term used to describe the process of recording movement and translating that movement on to a digital model), and admittedly that's probably where the Adventures of Tintin suffers most. While this isn't exactly the Uncanny Valley (I swear those posters with Bianca Castafiore look too real to be animated), it's still not the best it could possibly be. If I were to come in and having never seen a movie using Motion Caption (which Thankfully I have), I would find the faces of the characters to be freaky. The motion caption in this movie is however better than the motion caption that was used in the Polar Express, or 2009's A Christmas Carol, and does show some improvements, often veering between real and unreal. The acting (or voice acting), is good. Jamie Bell is decent in the title role, although his character is not well developed (Tintin's character development is not the focus of the stories anyway). Andy Serkis does a great job playing the character of Captain Archibald Haddock, the descendant of Sir Francis Haddock (the Captain of the Unicorn), having a fairly decent Scottish accent (although to be fair his nationality was never directly been revealed in the comics). As I said earlier Daniel Craig comes off as being unrecognizable as Ivan Sakharine the villain (who's character was actually not a villain in the original story but a collector of ships), complete with a different voice. The team of Nick Frost and Simon Pegg add humor (and maybe some unnecessary humor) as the two inept Scotland Yard detectives Thompson and Thomson. The characters have some funny scenes, but I wasn't laughing at all their antics. The score by John Williams (who else could score a Steven Spielberg film?) is well done, while not as memorable as Indiana Jones, it still has it's own beat.The writers Steven Moffat, Edgar Wright, and Joe Cornish have written a grand adventure story, with some comical moments through in their for good measure.The opening sequences is well done, with a jazzy tune, showing Tintin running through a series of comics.The ending leaves the film open for a sequel, and I can only hope that the U.S. is willing to give Tintin a chance, because dismal box office in the U.S. may persuade Paramount to can the sequel they already announced (thankfully it's been doing gangbusters oversees, so that may change their minds).The adventures of Tintin is a thrilling and fun adventure movie, featuring some of the better use of Motion Caption. With Tintin Steven Spielberg has crafted another fine adventure film.",9,0,3,23 December 2011
Begin Again," Pleasant Film
","John Carney's Begin Again is a nice little somewhat 'feel good' musical set in New York. The film features some very good performances and the songs are also memorable and well written.Begin Again tells the story of Greta (played by Keira Knightley) and her boyfriend/college sweetheart, named Dave (played by Adam Levine of Maroon 5 and The Voice making his feature film debut), who are songwriter partners. Their relationship hits a rocky road when Dave lands a major deal in Los Angeles and strays away from Greta, leaving her on her own. She is discovered on an east village stage by a washed up divorced record label executive named Dan (played by Mark Ruffalo), who takes to her talent and tries to make her a name. As the two begin their collaboration, they run into some problems along the way.There are some clear character arcs in the story as well. Dan, for example, goes from being an unlikeable drunk who is a disgraced and fired record producer, to having his job back, as well as improving his relationship with his daughter. Similarly, Greta goes from being a love-struck songwriter with no real ambitions to being an ambitious songwriter/singer who can clearly think on her own. The stories of these two characters parallel each other well. Other character arcs include Dan's daughter, Violet (played by Hailee Steinfeld), who seems to have limited screen time (disappearing after the first ten minutes and not reappearing until an hour in), going from an angst-ridden daughter to discovering her talents for playing guitar. While Dave, Greta's lover, goes from being an ambitious songwriter/singer to understanding just what fame is doing to him, in a story-arc that is almost like the opposite of Greta's.The acting in the film is very good. Mark Ruffalo has gained some weight, and is showing his age. When he talks to Knightley near the end of the film and says 'you know nothing', he delivers that line with such energy and force, it is terrific. Keira Knightly herself comes off as rather bitchy at the beginning of the film, but by the end, she develops into a finer character, even if her performance at times can feel emotionless. Hailee Steinfeld, as Ruffalo's daughter, is wasted and brings nothing to the table. Similarly, Catherine Keener is wasted as Ruffalo's ex, and her character is treated like your typical divorced nagging ex-wife. In his major film debut, singer Adam Levine has a nice voice, but his performances are, at times, bland, though his scenes with Knightley do show good moments of acting. Additionally, of note in the cast are Mos Def (under the alias Yasiin Bey!!!) as the owner of the record studio and Ceelo Green as a character named Troublegum, as a performer (basically playing himself).The songs are really nicely done. One of my favorite scenes in the film is when Knightley and Ruffalo are walking down the streets of New York and they manage to incorporate 'Luck Be a Lady' by Frank Sinatra in a way that gave me a feeling of happiness and excitement. The majority of the original songs are written by Gregg Alexander and Nick Lashley (director John Carney himself contributed to two songs, including 'Like a Fool' which has to do with trusting people. Knightley herself has a nice singing voice (having been trained by a voice specialist), and songs like 'Lost Stars' and 'A Higher Place' are good and having meaning. There are many good performances, even if some of the characters exist solely for the purpose of having real nice songs played. Given Carney's previous film, Once, one should probably not be surprised, as that film also dealt with music.Begin Again has a very pleasing tone to it. The songs, along with the character arcs, contribute to the films overall style. Definitely worth checking out.",7,2,5,7 September 2014
Man of Steel," Spectacular
","MOS might seem loud to some, but I thought it had the perfect balance of character and action. The film seemed to have the whole Superman is Jesus metaphor, but I didn't mind it all. In fact it makes complete sense given the context of the film. Henry Cavill is very good as Superman. There were a few parts where I could hear his British accent slipping, but otherwise he fit the part, he was very suave and handsome (I'm not gay BTW). Amy Adams is given a lot to do as Lois Lane. In fact she has a lot more screen time than I expected. The relationship between Superman and Lois is not exactly 'great' in this film per say, but Adams and Cavill have very good chemistry between each other, and the fact that Lois knows who Superman is off the bat, made it all the more better. Michael Shannon is decent as Zod, but I must admit his voice is somewhat of a turn off for me, so I couldn't take him completely serious in the role. The fact that Zod isn't exactly a villain, but someone who believes what he's doing is right, made the portrayal of the character, better than how he was portrayed in Superman 2. Crowe as Jor-EL is good, but he seemed to be slumming it a little. He seemed to have too little energy. Fishburne as Perry White was fine, but he really wasn't given enough to do (which is to be expected). He was very demanding and bossy, much like Perry White would be. Costner and Lane are good, but they didn't have much screen time, so I didn't feel they brought much to the table. Again the 3D brought nothing new to the table. It was a complete waste of money (as usual). Also Jenny Olsen (or just Jenny) didn't play much of a role in this film (as I expected), but I must admit she was given a good scene. I hope this film is successful enough to start a DCMU, however given WB's slow track record; it'll be a long time before we see a DC adaption that isn't Superman or even Batman. 9 / 10",7,1,5,15 June 2013
Hugo," This isn't just a movie (Maybe Spoilers!!!
","Hugo 2011, directed by Martin Scorsese. Starring Ben Kingsley, Sacha Baron Cohen, Asa Butterfield, Chlo√´ Grace Moretz, Ray Winstone, Emily Mortimer and Christopher Lee.Hugo is a special kind of movie, a kind of movie that makes you realize how you love the movies.The basic plot follows Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) a orphaned boy living in Paris in 1931. His father raised him when he was younger, but ended up dying in a museum fire, leaving behind a broken-down Automaton for Hugo to look after. Hugo is taken away by his uncle, an alcoholic watchmaker who is responsible for maintaining the clocks in a railway station. His uncle teaches him to take care of the clocks and then vanishes.Hugo lives between the walls of the train station, working on the clocks, stealing food and attempting to fix the Automation Hugo steals some mechanical parts in the station's toy store, hoping to use them to repair the automation, but is caught by the owner, who takes Hugo's blueprints that he used for the automation.Hugo's quest to fix the automation, leads him to meet a girl named Isabelle (Chloe-Grace Moretz, who I must admit I felt a sorry for, because she was the only major cast-member who was American). Isabelle turns out to be the Godfather of the person who owns the Toy-Store. She helps him with fixing the automation, and along the way he shares his love of movies to her, something she has never seen, because her Godfather has forbid her from ever seeing one.Hugo is a brilliant film, one of the best I've seen all year. Scorsese directing is spot on, and France is brilliantly recreated to look like the 30's. The screenplay by John Logan (adapting Brian Selznick's the Invention of Hugo Cabaret) is excellent, with dialogue that is memorable.The acting is extremely good. I never let the non-french speakers (most of the actors in the movie were from the UK, not France) distract me from enjoying the film, but I wanna credit to Sacha Baron Cohen who is excellent as Inspector Gustav. A sort of buffoonish French Inspector (his voice reminds me a lot of Peter Seller's Inspector Clouseau) who looks for orphaned child so he can send them off to the orphanage. His performance is assuming and brilliant at the same time. If I had my way, he would get an Oscar Nomination for his performance. Ben Kingsley (another person deserving of a Academy Award nomination) is also excellent in his role as the Toy Store Owner (known as Papa Georges), who has a secret to hide. Asa Butterfield is impressive as the title character, and shows promise to became a great actor in the future. Jude Law does well playing Hugo's Father, but he doesn't have much screened time, and he only appears near the beginning. The rest of the cast is good, especially the immortal Christopher Lee as the Bookshop Owner.You'd think from the trailer and advertisements, this be another family film, but the truth is, it's not. Hugo is more than just a family film, it's a film for film lovers. Scorsese really shows how much he loves film. I left the theater feeling really satisfied.10/10, nearly flawless.",10,3,7,21 December 2011
Dallas Buyers Club," A Terrific Experience
","Dallas Buyers Club opens with a scene of Matthew McConaughey humping a woman while at a bull riding venue. There is no dialog in the scene, just the sound effect of 'screeching'. This opening scene more or less sets the audience up for what they should expect the film to be like. Certainly, it is one of the more interesting ways in which a director opens his film this year.Dallas Buyers Club is based off the story of Ron Woodroof, played by Matthew McConaughey, who lost 40 pounds for this role and almost dominates the film. Woodroof was a handsome, macho, playboy, homophobic bull rider, but after he was diagnosed with HIV, due to unprotected sex, he starts to see things a little differently. After getting approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Woodroof gets AZT to treat HIV/AIDs, but due to consuming AZT, as well as substance abuse, Woodroof comes close to dying. Realizing this, Woodroof starts a worldwide search for a fallen doctor (Griffin Dunne) who prescribes antiviral drugs. Along the way, Woodroof meets Rayon, a transvestite who changes Woodroof's views on homosexuals, and played by Jared Leto, who is completely transformed in this role, with makeup and weight loss much like McConaughey. Becoming an inspiration for HIV/AIDS people everywhere, Woodroof, along with his friend Rayon, starts The Dallas Buyers Club, a new place for HIV people, which eventually leads him directly in conflict with the FDA.Dallas Buyers Club shows how 'greedy' and untrustworthy pharmaceutical companies can be. The film actually seems to support two different sides. On the one side, you have Dr. Sevard (Denis O'Hare) and Richard Barkley (Michael O'Neill) representing the 'corrupt' side of things. More motivated by money than anything else, they don't even seemingly bother to look at how good their prescriptions are. The other side is the 'good guys', the ones who seemingly want to help: Eve (Jennifer Garner), and Dr. Vass (Griffin Dunne). Some people are just in it for the money and are not to be trusted.The acting is, for the most part, pretty great. This film relies heavily on its performances. As mentioned above, both McConaughey and Leto lost a lot of weight to play their roles, and both actors are very skinny. McConaughey, as Woodruff, delivers an Oscar worthy performance. His accent fits the character perfectly, and he portrays an abuser with tremendous power. When McConaughey says '#uck' when he discovers that he is truly diagnosed with HIV and AIDS, his scream is delivered priceless. McConaughey, as an actor, has gone through a major career change, and is no longer considered a joke among his peers. He went from being a promising actor, the male lead in 'lousy romantic comedies', and to where he is now, a real serious dramatic actor. The fact that he manages to snag so many award nominations, and even win a few, as well the Oscar possibly, speaks volumes of how much he has changed as an actor.I wouldn't be the first to say the film's most outstanding performance is not from McConaughey himself, but from Jared Leto as Rayon. His voice, his makeup, its all done perfectly, transformed into his role as a transvestite. Sometimes, I even swear he was a woman. His performance in Dallas Buyers Club, feels very much like a Leto performance, as it continues his willingness to do anything for a role. It's not hard to see why he is the front-runner this year for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.Most of the other performances in the film are good, but those two are especially outstanding. Jennifer Garner is unmemorable in the role as Eve a doctor. Though Garner isn't awful, her performance leaves much to desire. Thankfully even the writers realized that, as the film seems to be more about the relationship between Woodroof and Rayon, then that of Woodroof and Eve. Denis O'Hare and Michael O'Neill are just playing stock corrupt doctors and aren't developed much beyond that, which may be considered one of the films biggest weakness, though it didn't bother me at all.The direction by French Canadian director Jean-Marc Vallee is especially good. Just about every shot is clear. The decision to have scenes without dialog and just 'screeching', was especially interesting. If this was in the wrong hands, it could have potentially been disastrous. The editing is also good and the film flows at a nice pace, being a little less than 2 hours. Dallas Buyers Club is an extraordinary film which shows just how far one man with AIDS went to find a cure. The acting and directing makes the film and it is definitely one of 2013's very best.",9,2,3,9 February 2014
Bridesmaids," Entertaining (maybe some spoilers)
","Bridesmaids directed by Paul Feig, written by Annie Mumolo and Kristen Wiig.Starring Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne, Wendi McLendon-Covey, Ellie Kemper, Melissa McCarthy, and Chris O'Dowd.Let me start by saying expectations for this film were pretty high, and they were met to a certain degree. Bridesmaids is a fairly entertaining film, with several funny moments but also several WTF one's as well.The basic plot is that of Annie a woman who lost not only her boyfriend but also all of her savings. She then finds that she has been picked as her best friend's maid of honor, where she finds herself working through some weird rituals alongside a group of bridesmaids.This film has some nice direction (alongside other things) and some funny moments. It's pretty impressive considering the fact that this is Kristen Wiig's first leading role (I don't think she's very funny on SNL), and there's some funny moments from other members of the cast (especially Jon Hamm in a cameo as Ted a man that Annie has a sexual relationship with).One note of interest is that this is Jill Clayburgh's final film (the actress that played Annie's mother). Not the best way to end your career, if you ask me.Overall a pretty good time.",6,0,2,23 September 2011
The Grand Budapest Hotel," More Cartoon Antics From Wes Anderson
","If I told a film fan that a film directed by Wes Anderson was basically a live action cartoon, would they be surprised? Well, I don't think so. So it came as no surprise to me when I saw The Grand Budapest Hotel, that it had one wacky scene after another. With The Grand Budapest Hotel, Wes Anderson has made another masterpiece of comical proportions. A film that is so absurd and yet so greatly made, it has to be seen to be believed.The Grand Budapest Hotel continues Wes Anderson's ridiculousness. As a director, Anderson has made quite the career for himself. He's a true auteur, having a distinct style that is apparent in all of his films. Most of them are about depressing characters, and they feature black humor; lots and lots of it. The Grand Budapest Hotel, as its title would suggest, is about a hotel located in Europe. The film actually takes place in about three different time periods. Though they never say it, the film opens in the present, and then flashbacks to 1985 and 1932. The present scenes concern a girl. While the scenes in the 1982 concerns a young writer (Jude Law) who visits the hotel and encounters Mr. Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) who recalls about a story about when he was a lobby boy working under the whim of M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) at the hotel, and how the two ended up getting involved in a crime involving murder and theft.This film seems to have a lot going on. At the same time, it's played out at such at a silly pace, that I can't help but smile. There is a lot to laugh about in this film. From the prison escape scene, where Gustave and company stands on really high places just to escape, to the snow chase with Gustave and Zero attempting to get Jopling (Willem Dafoe), this film is a riot. The characters in this movie are played to such extremes; that they are fun to watch, in spite of the problems they seem to be facing. Although this film deals with not so friendly themes, it never takes itself too seriously, instead opting to put into the 'Anderson world', where physics and reality take a back seat to extreme shenanigans.This movie is helped very much by its actors. Anderson has brought back some of his old cast, in addition to some new people. Returning favorites include, Adrien Brody, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman and Owen Wilson, but we also meet such newcomers such as, F. Murray Abraham, and the film's newcomer (the actor had actually been in a movie and some TV shows), Tony Revolvri all bring their A game to this Wes Anderson's jam. Although the majority of the actors in this film take a back seat too Fiennes, most of them seem to fit right in with Anderson's nonsensical style.The actors all play different roles. Ralph Fiennes is the hotel's strict but likable owner, Adrien Brody is one of the villains of the story, and tries to make his voice deep and menacing, but comes off as silly, which seems to be intentional, given the tone of the film. Tilda Swinton brings her acting skills to a nothing role, where she spends the majority of the film as a corpse. Edward Norton does well as a serious officer, despite limited screen time. Bill Murray has a thankless but important role. Jason Schwartzman appears at the beginning as one of the people working at hotel in 1985 and then disappears for the remainder of the film. Willem Dafoe is playing his usual slimy, creepy character, a killer, and Jeff Goldblum plays a deputy who delivers a lot of expression, but gets a moment to shine (Goldblum and Dafoe have a chase scene, which is interesting, when you consider that the two have only worked with Wes Anderson once before, in the same movie, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou). Saoirse Ronan is nice and calm in her role as a young woman who falls for the bellhop. Speaking of the bellhop, in his film debut, Tony Revolori shows a lot of energy for someone who is new to acting, especially when compared to the other actors in this film. The actors in this film are very much essential to what makes this film work. They are the glue to Wes Anderson's script. Their wacky and sometimes calm performances fit in very well, here.The film has plenty of funny moments. Quotes such as 'The rest of this #hit is worthless junk', had my audience cracking up. Anderson certainly knows how to write a good script. Additionally, the film uses a classical score, much like most of Anderson's films, with things such as violins and pianos being heard in the background.The Grand Budapest Hotel is an experience in many ways. It's a film that I have a lot interest to go back to see, over and over again. The actors, the directing, the humor, it just all somehow works, to make a wondrously silly film, that is deserving of the Wes Anderson name. With this film I'm reminded of why I'm such a big fan of Wes Anderson, he makes the kinds of movies I would want to make, if I was making a feature films right now.",10,1,6,24 May 2014
Frank," A Hysterical Black Comedy That Has To Be Seen To Be Believed
","Frank features a poster which depicts a giant cartoon head. Now some people who haven't seen the trailer might assume that it's just there for the point of advertising, or there's an animated sequence in the film, but no, the title character of the film is a man who dresses up in a cartoon head. That seems in of itself a crazy concept, but it fits with the rest of the film, which goes from being a quirky dark comedy to basically being down right serious and realistic at the end. In short, Frank is a gem that I can recommend to just about anyone, unless men wearing cartoon faces and crazy antics isn't your idea of a good time. Frank tells the story of Jon Burroughs (played by Domnhall Gleason) who is surprisingly likable and later in the film even works perfect as a jackass when he lets fame get to his head. Burroughs is a young wanna-be musician from Ireland who meets a traveling band. The band is led by Frank played by Michael Fassbender a mysterious cartoon wearing headman. Jon eventually learns that he's gotten himself into more than he can handle by joining this band. Frank is at its heart a black comedy that eventually evolves into a cross country road-trip film, and then even becomes serious by the end. It's nonetheless a hilarious movie to watch. The script by Jon Ronson and Peter Straughan is very clever and includes some memorable dialogue. Although Frank is not the main character of the film (despite the title being named after him), by having his antics be center stage of the film, it makes for interesting and hilarious situations. Frank himself is an interesting character, a man who received a cartoon mask as a teenager and wouldn't take it off, instead preferring to conceal his true face and identity. As the main character, Jon has an interesting character arc in the film himself, going an aspiring almost weak songwriter who can't seem to finish or write any memorable songs, to letting fame get to him, and eventually becoming extremely unlikeable as a person. The rest of the band, which makes up the bulk of the major characters in the film are also interesting. You have Maggie Gyllenhaal as Clara, the aggressive chick of the group, who rarely has anything nice to say (at least until the end of the film), and has absolutely little regard for Jon as a person. Gyllenhaal is even very sexy in some of her scenes. There's Scoot McNairy as Don, the bands' manager who eventually commits suicide with a Frank mask on and in a rather comical and dark scene they place his body on a boat with flames into the river (basically being his grave) until a slight problem occurs, and ruins the moment for them. Francois Civil as Baraque the French bassist (he literally only speaks French throughout the film) and Carla Azar as Nana, the band's drummer, make up the rest of the cast. Both characters, Baraque and Nana, also show little empathy for Jon. These characters are basically a group of misfits with their own quirks and problems. Although I had issues with another movie that started out as a quirky comedy, that being Michel Gondry's Mood Indigo, Frank's tonal shift at the end didn't bother me as much as that film did, because in addition to a much weirder and more surrealistic film, Mood Indigo still kept its crazy tone, even at the funeral sequences. In comparison, Frank, became down to earth and less quirky, which I appreciated. None of the songs in Frank are especially memorable, which is the point of the film, as Jon sees himself as an amazing lyricist, when the best thing he can come up with is repeating the same sound over and over. The actual actors performed in the band, which isn't surprising given that the songs aren't really performed all that memorably to begin with. Frank is definitely not a movie made with the general audience in mind. I appreciate the film for that, though as its crazy concept, along with the antics, made me laughing and smiling until the last act. Even the tonal shift of the film didn't bother me that much. Frank's black comedy aspect is something I very much appreciate about the film. Frank, is overall an enjoyable movie, and I would recommend it to anyone, but be warned, you may not get the concept. Yes, it's that weird of a film and I liked it a lot because of that.",9,1,3,28 September 2014
Jurassic Park," If there had to be a film where the special effects outshined the actors this would be it (spoilers indeed).
","Jurassic Park (1993) directed by Steven Spielberg. Starring Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum and Richard Attenborough.I recently had the pleasure of seeing Steven Spielberg 1993 dinosaur blockbuster masterpiece adaption of the best-selling Michael Crichton book, on the big screen for the first time. Having never been able to have seen on the big screen myself, all I can say is wow. Even for it's time the special effects are amazing (even there time) that this movie seems less outdated then it would be.Having read the Michael Crichton book (and it's sequel) I can say as an adaption, it did take certain liberties with the book (Hammond being more of a grandfather than a coward, or Donald Gennero being a coward), but letting all that aside it's a very entertaining movie.The plot follows two paleontologists (Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler played by Sam Neill and Laura Dern) who are summoned by Billionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) to visit his new amusement park that's he planing to open. Joining them are a Mathematician named Ian Malcolm (who's character just for the record disappears near the end of the book and doesn't appear again), and a lawyer named Donald Gennero (played by Martin Ferrero, don't we all just hate that blasted lawyer). John Hammond wants them to try out his park so they can examine it, and give there own opinions.Much to their surprise (and a big surprise) the park is full of dinosaurs (made using mosquito blood which is spliced together with other animals such as fill in order to fill the gaps of the genetic strains). The Dinosaurs are kept near steel bars so as to not escape and wreck havoc.That being said Hammond wants them to take a tour of his park along with his grand-kids Lex (Ariana Richards) and Tim (Joseph Mazzello, who is obsessed Grant, which delights and annoys him at the same time).While this is going one of the people working at InGen (the company responsible for making the dinosaurs) a computer program named Dennis Nerdly is attempting to shut down the park so he can steal Dinosaur embroys to give to a rival company.Nerdly is successful in shutting down the park, but eventually meets his death in a gruesome way (won't spoil it for anyone who's seen the film), and the Dinosaur are released, leading to several scenes involving characters meeting their deaths. It especially becomes a problem as it means that the T-Rex is free. The rest of the story is about how the people staying at Jurassic Park attempt to survive getting eaten by dinosaur.This film is one of my favorites, and while the story is fairly light, the special effects are a must, even for their time the special effects are astounding (and seeing it on the big screen, didn't change my opinion at all, just look at the dinosaurs amazing). The direction is well done (Spielberg is truly one of the greatest modern day directors working right now), and I admit the acting is a little lame (save for a few performances), but hey why do you expect good acting from a film, when all your actors are running around screaming all the time. The script works, making sense of the plot and not creating too many plot-holes. As a whole this film has really stood up, quite well, and seeing it on the big screen was a treat.",9,1,1,14 October 2011
