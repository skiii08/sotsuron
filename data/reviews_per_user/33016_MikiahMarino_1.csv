The Avengers," Fun movie, easy to watch
","I went into this movie with high expectations being a comic junkie and was not let down. Although it has some major plot holes ( Thors arrival, Hulk finding his way to the battle, selvick building a safety in the portal, etc.) and not the most original plot it still manages to completely satisfy me. When I go into a movie, I use six main things for rating a movie....... 1.Is it engaging from the start? 2. Are the characters interesting? 3. Is the acting good. 4. Are the effects quality? 5. Is the plot good? 6. How much would I want to watch it again?The constant action through the film manages to keep you entertained and the good actors and special effects make this movie easy to watch. Throughout the movie there is this sense that no (major) character will die, and it brilliantly replaces the feeling that they will all live happily ever after with a fun sense of comedy and a spring in its step. This movie is by no means perfect, but it effectively manages to keep you on your toes and makes you want to watch it again and again. I may have some bias based on my love of superheroes, but I definitely recommend this movie.",9,5,9,7 December 2012
