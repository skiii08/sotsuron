The Blair Witch Project," My reaction to the movie
","If I could have gotten my money back for this stinker, I would have.  This movie had no plot, no actors, no script, no scares, and absolutely no business being on the big screen.  It was a childish attempt at horror. The 'actors' made the lines up as they went along and you could tell.  The best they could come up with is 'f' this and 'f' that.  That took a whole lot of talent. NOT!  As for the horror factor, three idiots running around the woods with a video camera screaming at each other is not scary.  The way they handled the camera, I'm surprised no one had to leave the theatre to throw up from motion sickness.  You were never shown anything that could actually scare you.  Hand prints on a deserted houses walls is not scary. Noises in the woods barely audible is not scary.  Twigs tied together is not scary.  A chicken heart in a hanky is not scary. What is scary is all the over rated whoopla that has been made about this thing.  What is even scarier is people spending that kind of money to see it.  And finally what frightens me the most is the money I paid.  I wish the witch would have taken me away from the movie.  Oh wait, she couldn't because there wasn't one or at least none the movie showed.  IT STINKS!",1,1,3,15 August 1999
