Catch Me If You Can," Fun, entertaining
","A long time ago I heard an interview with a guy named Frank (Inever could remember the last name)  who was the best con artistever.  I loved the story, unfortunately my brother loaned the audiotape out and I never saw it again.  Imagine my delight when I sawthe preview for this movie!  I couldn't stop talking about it.  And themovie was almost as good as my recollection of the guy'sautobiographical tale (amazingly enough.) Leonardo Di Caprio plays the part marvelously.      Christopher Walken is fabulous--heis an amazing actor--and I always enjoy Tom Hanks.",8,0,1,5 January 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Too violent for me
","And I like violence!  At least a lot of it.  Stuff like Fight Club, Snatchetc.  But war....not so much, and that is all the 2nd LOTR is. I didenjoy many parts (the tree guys, especially.)  But the intensity of themovie was too much for me over a three hour time span.  And Iwanted to see more magical acts, eg wizardry!  ( I honestly don'tremember if there was a lot in the book.) The movie was an epic,no doubt, but I'm certainly not going to see it in the theater again.",8,0,0,22 December 2002
8 Mile," entertaining
","I did enjoy this movie while watching it but afterwards, when my adrenaline lessened, my opinion kept sliding down on the rating scale 7.5.....7......6.5......6.The characterization is flat and the story is limited. Throughout the whole movie I was waiting for the last rap battle to take place (Ok, already, stop the BS and get to it)--which was fabulous, and I will probably purchase the movie just to watch that scene again. And I can't help but like Eminem;  he is a charizmatic individual. I did enjoy the glimpse into lives that are completely unlike my own. And I am a sucker for Eminem's music. So I would recommend the movie for a one time viewing, but probably not much more than that.",6,0,1,12 November 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Grand, better than the first
","I've read all the harry potter books 2-3 times a piece, so its cool tosee the story on screen.  This movie stays truer to the book thanSorcerer's Stone did, and I liked that.  I did not like getting out at12:50 am, after sitting for 2 hrs and 40 min (or so).  To be sure, Ithink that they had a preview of every genre of movie, just to try andhit all  target audiences that might show up.  Anyhoo, I loved theaventurous heart of this movie, even when they changed a fewthings (ie,  'your palms are sweaty.'  HA!)  I still miss  JK Rowlingswit and sense of the ironic, although it was captured more in thisscript than in the second.  Ah well, you can't have everything.  Ithought that this movie wasn't as choppy as the last, and I loved allof the new characters, especially Lucius Malfoy.  Jason Isaacs dida fabulous job (as did everyone.)",7,0,0,16 November 2002
