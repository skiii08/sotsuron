Lucky Number Slevin," Movies don't come any better !
","There was a time I saw the Usual Suspects in a pre- screening and thought it was the best. Then I saw Pulp Fiction and thought it was even better, but crueler. And then somebody told me, hey I loved this 'lucky number slevin' one but you know what ... so did I with Usual Suspects and Pulp Fiction ... but that was years before pensioners started to pick it up as a freebie with the renewal of their dental magazine. This IS the best written script, edited movie and story that keeps you going till the last moment. ... but I hope you will NOT go and see it or RENT it ... because this is the way I would like to keep it. After probably have seen over 5000 movies ... this is mine ... my secret. Thanks Bruce, Morgan, Stanley , Lucy and yes Josh ! Way to go ... excellent acting! But you all must have fun making this one. The director ... well I will not call you the new Tarantino ... no ... you are Paul McGuigan .. a name I will remember. I hope it does not get an Oscar ... because it deserves better!",10,4,8,17 July 2006
