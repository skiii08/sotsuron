The Hangover," Need a laugh...go for this one for sure!
","When did I laugh so much for a movie....long time!! If you are in for a good laugh...go for it! The movie is just fantastically made, with all the characters fitting in perfectly for the roles. Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, and Ed Helms are all so very amazing. Its Vegas baby, and who doesn't want to be there! The Script is perfect for the location (bachelor party) and the Director, Todd Phillips has just made a wonder out of it. Except for the scene where they carry back the Tiger, I never felt that there was any moment in the movie that looked 'unreal'. Plain movie where circumstances take them around, and made such a good humorous flick out of it. Phil (Bradley Cooper), the cool dude, driving the story, with Alan (Zach) in all that crazy stuff and Stu (Ed Helms) cracking those comments just perfectly fit in to make it a mind blowing hilarious flick. A special mention to Jade (Heather Graham) who looks lovely as ever making the guys skip a beat for sure. Mike Tyson with his best punch and the Chinese guy Ken Jeong with his unique style just make it a worth watch file. Liked the last part the most where they check out the pics and finally have the mystery unfolded.Must watch movie guys. I did already twice.",10,9,16,8 June 2009
The Ugly Truth," One time watch
","The movie is the usual - guy in love with the girl....n she isn't initially but does finally - kinds. The movie is good in the sense that it goes fine and you are not bugged with it at anytime. There are sequences which make you laugh, but not enough to make it a great romantic comedy! Its a one time watch, with your girlfriend. Nothing different except for the 'Ugly Truth' portrayed, which is nothing but the problems that keep the love life apart for today's generation, which is done in a humorous way. The script is well written and would give it a 7, but when you watch the movie, it can not be that interesting at times. So I would rather give it a 6.",6,0,4,10 August 2009
