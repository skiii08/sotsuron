The Blair Witch Project," neither horrifying nor thrilling
","The Blair Witch Project is absolutely boring.  It is not scary, or even creepy; it is astonishing that anyone could find it so much as unsettling. Moreover, the performance of the main character/actor Heather Donohue is unbelievable and overacted.If you must see this movie, wait for it to come out on video or on TV; it simply doesn't need to be seen on a big screen.  In fact, it simply needn't be seen at all; don't waste your time or money with it.If you want a quality psychological movie in the horror/thriller genre try Les Diabolique (1955) or The Innocents (1961).",1,1,2,5 August 1999
The Matrix," Intelligent movie, AMAZING effects
","A number of other commentators have noted that this film calls Philip K. Dick to mind (probably thinking of 'We Can Remember it for You Wholesale' which was made into 'Total Recall').Actually, it reminds me very much of Fritz Leiber's 'You're All Alone' which Leiber also rewrote as 'The Sinful Ones.'  For anyone who liked The Matrix, I would recommend reading either or both of those stories, and Leiber in general.A few complained about the screenplay or plot, but I thought it was very enjoyable all around, and found the 'exposition scenes' to be helpful, and not tedious at all.The effects are just amazing, though, and that's the main reason why I went to see it, just like with 'What Dreams May Come,' which also had amazing effects.  I wouldn't be surprised to see a Jackie Chan movie employing the 'bullet time' effect in the future as well...in fact, I hope we will.",Null,0,0,4 April 1999
