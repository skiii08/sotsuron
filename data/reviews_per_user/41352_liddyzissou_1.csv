Requiem for a Dream," Beautiful Film, Will Change You
","Needless to say, anyone who has viewed this film with an open mind, and has carefully considered the cinematography and sound, will be able to conclude it is a wonderfully made piece of art. Also, it is quite disturbing also, visually and mentally. The characters are portrayed to perfection; anyone who has read the novel by Hubert Selby, Jr. can agree with that statement. This is one of very few films that truly 'moved' me. Not moved necessarily in a good way, but moved. It should be noted anyone considering viewing this must keep in mind it will not leave you feeling happy and ready to take on the world. Rather, it will possibly upset the viewer, and if it doesn't accomplish that, it will at least leave you pondering much of your own ways in life.This is one of the best films made in the last twenty years, and the mix of great visuals, amazing sound, and a great cast combine to make it so. I own the film and have watched it at least twenty times. One thing I can say with confidence is I have never duplicated the feeling I had when I first watched it. I was left so speechless it amazed me, as few movies can really do that to me. Every time I watch it, I am left feeling reflective to say the least, but the first viewing is almost an out-of-body experience which will go un-matched for most. I say watch it, and really take it in as a whole, otherwise you will have missed out on a great opportunity to learn something about yourself and life in general.",10,1,2,19 March 2006
