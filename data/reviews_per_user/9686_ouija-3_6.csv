Scarface," Bloated gangster saga
","I have nothing against long films, on the contrary, I like them often. But this one seems to go on forever and its length is not justified.Like most DePalma's films, Scarface leaves you feeling guilty and dirty, largely because the film seems so sensationalistic in its approach to the subject. The cast (over-)acts with gusto, though, and in a way, the self-indulgence of the film is one of the reasons that make it interesting and watchable, even multiple times.The music score is absolutely hideous and horrific!4/10",Null,0,0,13 August 2000
Barry Lyndon," Superb
","Barry Lyndon is not the film that Stanley Kubrick will be remembered by. When it was released it was not a success. The reasons were obvious: typically for Kubrick, the film is detached and cool, its pace is very slow and the main character is not a particularly likable fellow.However, despite being long, Barry Lyndon is definitely intentionally long and slow. Despite the coolness of the approach, one cannot be unmoved by and uninterested in the characters and their destinies. Barry Lyndon is not a two-dimensional, bad man but a man of contradictions and thus very lifelike.
The film must be the most visually beautiful ever made, the period is carefully brought to life and the fact that the film is slow and in two parts divided by an intermission is making us feel the different understanding of time in the 18th century, as well as Thackeray's novel's form. Superb use of period music supports the actions.To an MTV generation with a penchant for hyperactive kinetic experiences with with no content and an attention span of a few minutes, this superb work of art will, alas, not be  comprehensible.",Null,1,2,15 July 2000
Doctor Zhivago," Flawed epic that still delivers
","After the magnificent Lawrence of Arabia, director David Lean tried to make another big, epic film that focuses on individuals and their actions during important historical times which in Zhivago is the Russian revolution. This time Lean didn't succeed quite as well.The cons:The biggest problems of the film are caused by the screenplay. Doctor Zhivago centres on the actions of the three main characters: doctor and poet Yuri Zhivago, his childhood friend Tonya and his mistress Lara. Unfortunately these main characters' motivations are not always clear to the viewer, resulting in a lack of emotional connection to their plight. On the other hand, some of the supporting actors such as Alec Guinness, Ralph Richardson and particularly Rod Steiger stand out as somewhat more interesting characters because of their rather straightforward motives that lack the passion of the Yuri-Tonya-Lara triangle. On the other hand, Klaus Kinski's anarchist character is too small a role to be justifiably included in the film. And Tom Courtenay's poorly played Strelnikov is also a man whose motivations are unclear because the viewer does not know anything about his personal feelings, except that he was Lara's husband or fianc√© at some point and survived a demonstration that became a slaughter carried out by the Cossacks. Tom Courtenay is simply wooden.Also, the political background is a bit too distant in relation to the love story, and the film is too long.  The pros:David Lean was a master director and his strong storytelling improves the flawed script. His skill in not making a long film seem uninteresting or too slow in pace was remarkable. In addition to this, his visual style is strong and he seemed to know how to best photograph those wide vistas of Russia (actually shot in Spain and here in Finland).Freddie Young's cinematography (though this time only in Panavision instead of Super Panavision 70 that was used in Lawrence of Arabia) is excellent and there's not a bad word one can say about the sets or the costumes. The feeling of the period is wonderfully created.In the end, one does feel that the story of Yuri Zhivago was ultimately touching and the film's structure of having Alec Guinness as a guide and occasional narrator through Yuri's life in flashback is economical and works very well. Doctor Zhivago is flawed but nonetheless a classic epic and the kind of film that Titanic and Pearl Harbor tried to be (and failed miserably).",Null,1,9,23 February 2002
The Shining," Spooky, great, difficult film
","The Shining is one of the scariest films ever made. The amazing thing is that, when you think about it, it doesn't try to use those usual horror film tricks to make us scared; the apparitions are as realistic as real human beings, the pace is leisurely and unlike many inferior horror films, this pace with its disturbing atmosphere is distributed equally throughout the film. The problem of the film is that there are those who whine on and on about the film not being loyal to the book. That's right, because it's a film and the tension that is created in the book in some 300-400 pages cannot be presented in a film format, nor should it be even tried; by not slavishly repeating the plot and the views of the book this film manages to shift focus more to the filmic experience.The major problem of the Shining, however, is that the premise of the story is not clear enough: many people (like Maltin) have obviously interpreted that Jack Torrance should be normal in the beginning, but in the end he goes mad. But the point seems to be that when Torrance comes to Overlook hotel, he is already a time bomb ready to explode, he obviously is disturbed and dislikes his family very deeply. The viewer is left to determine to what extent this is due to the supernatural powers of the hotel. This implies that, as in other Kubrick films, the HOW is what the film deals with, how Jack becomes a dull boy, not so much the WHY. Why is more or less left to the viewer to interpret.",Null,0,0,18 July 2000
JFK," Superb political thriller
","JFK is a film designed to raise emotions (particularly those of touchy Americans). But whether one believes the assumptions about the assassination of Kennedy and the whole conspiracy theory as presented in this film or not, it's also a notable work cinematically.Despite the fact that in the last thirty-or-so minutes of the film the assassination theory is that of Jim Garrison, there are other theories and questions raised during the film that will keep you thinking about different possibilities.There are weaknesses, such as the stereotypical portrayal of the homosexuals and the unnecessary family quarrel scenes. But the powerhouse performances, John Williams' music, cinematography and spectacular editing will keep you glued to your seat and not notice the long running time.One of the (truly rare) classics of the 1990's.",10,3,15,21 June 2000
Titanic," My $ Heart $ Will $ Go $ On $
","No, Titanic is not one of the worst films of all time, but perhaps the worst big production in fifty years.James Cameron is obviously suitable to direct cyborg and action films and such, since the unbelievability of this film's characterization never rises above a TV daytime soaper: DiCaprio (a considerable talent) is wasted here as he plays his role like a spoiled 90's megastar. Winslet is slightly better, though she also has a thin role to play.Laughable situations abound: when the ship stands upright and people fall to their deaths, the main couple discuss:'This is where we first met!' Awful. The dim-witted young generation to whom this film is directed, is simply informed who the villains in the story are: they speak with British accents.The honest ones speak with American of Irish accents.Inside the ship during the sinking, the lights keep constantly fluttering, as in other action films set in dark places. I wish I could continue further, but I have to sum up the point: this so-called film is actually a machine whose sole function is to churn out money and more money. Sadly, it succeeded.",3,2,4,21 June 2000
