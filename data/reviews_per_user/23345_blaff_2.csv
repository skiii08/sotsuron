Requiem for a Dream," Downward spiraling tale of 4 drug addicts, what else is new?
","If you want to make sure your kids never do drugs take them to this movie. The story is familiar. Everything is ok when you are shooting cocaine. But when the addiction sets in and you can't get a fix things turn bad. The story imitates life too closely. Its not art its plain truth. The movie would have been good as a documentary. There are no heroes, no villains. No battles won, no triumphs. The lives of the 4 addicts begin bad and get worse. That's what drugs do. You know it, you've seen it. Do you really want to see it again? I say this movie should be required viewing for every 14 year old high school kid. Did I like it? No. Did it effect me? Yes. A 6 for its emotional effect.",6,0,0,18 August 2002
Training Day," Heart of Darkness on the streets of LA
",I like the movie. I live in LA and saw up close neighborhoods I wouldn't venture into with a panzered Humbvie. But I learned that gangs have a code of honor. The story of a rookie cop Jake (Ethan Hawke) getting his street IQ bumped up a few notches by veteran Narc Alonzo (Denzyl Washington). But is Alonzo the truth the way and the light or a seductive demon? There's enough seduction and mystery to keep us interested. There is a boatload of really good acting between the two leads as they drive around the streets of LA fulfilling Alonzos agenda. Unfortunately the movie has two really week moments for which I suspect director Antoine Fuqua is still taking heat. Both moments are heroic unbelievable revivals of Jake. I suggest Antoine should have made an alternate ending without such a heroic revival and stuck that on the DVD for the viewers who were taken out of their theatre seats and put on the streets of LA. 4 stars.,6,0,11,20 July 2002
