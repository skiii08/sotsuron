Blade Runner 2049," Could have been worse
","Director Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners) was quoted as saying that he would not be able to make this film as good as the original Blade Runner (1982), and he was correct. This film takes place 30 years after the first one that was set in 2019 and follows Ryan Gosling (Drive) playing a young blade runner who discovers a long-buried secret that leads him to track down a former blade runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), who's been missing for thirty years.It may be unfair to compare this belated sequel to the classic original but seeings as it is a sequel I cannot help but do so. The film in it's own right is well made and a step above most things that are going through your Cineplex these days but in comparison to the original it falls quite short in almost every way. Simply where the film does look pretty good, it does not look anywhere near as good as the original, the same can be said for all the design work and costuming which just does not have the care and inspiration of the former. The Music is good but mostly when its touting parts of the original score. The acting is good enough but not as good as the original and certainly the characters are not as good. The film also tries to emulate the slower pace of the first film but ends up being even slower and is so bloated at almost 3 hours which could've easily been 2 hours and been a better film for it with none of the themes or main story beats left out. It is more of a detective story than an action film just like the first was but the detective elements are not as strong or interesting this time around. Blade Runner 2049 does try to go in some new territory in the Blade Runner world but they are all the most obvious boring places to go that have been done before in other films and television (Battlestar Galactica). There are some subplots that have shades of Spike Jonze Her (2013) and there are some other scenes that are an attempt to set up further films in the franchise.It may sound like I am being quite hard on the film but there are things to enjoy, the visuals while a little too dark and lacking the wow factor of the original cinematography from Jordan Cronenweth are still miles above most films from our age. The sound design is huge and really second to none which makes it the one area that is better than the original film. The special effects are good although they do go Rogue One with bringing back one character digitally which whilst it is probably the best it has been done to date it still suffers from uncanny valley.In the end I would say it is a solid hard scifi which suffers in comparison to its roots which its best characters are under-used and is bloated but without any iconic scenes. Remember the scene from the original with the replicant stripper being shot in the back as she smashes through glass walls in slow motion, the scene with Rutger Hauer in the elevator lit up after killing Tyrell or his final epic monologue. The new film has none of the artistry that elevates a film to masterpiece. In short, it could have been a lot worse and it is no disgrace to what now has become a franchise I guess but its far from the suspicious rave reviews that have flooded the market days before release.",Null,23,66,5 October 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Rogue One Review
","A few years back when the surprise announcement was made that Disney would be buying Lucasfilm and acquiring the rights to make episodes 7,8,9 as well as spin off every alternate year, people were blown away but a lot of skepticism was present. A lot of that was dulled after The Force Awakens returned to a base practical effects and brought the fun back to the Star Wars Universe. Now however we have the first of the spin-off anthology films which has its share of production problem rumors and will have us following a group of rebels trying to retrieve plans for the Death Star that will take us bumper to bumper with the original Star Wars from 1977. For a start I will tell you that whilst there is a few old John Williams tracks merged into the score, the Michael Giacchino score takes you out of the universe as it pales in comparison to the scores of all the other films. John Williams music is an important piece of the feeling you get when you watch Star Wars and I would much rather they cobble together music from the previous 7 films than try and imitate it (poorly). The film is also not shot in the classic way all the others were but I guess these anthology films are going to take some risks and stray away from the Saga formula. After getting used to the look and score of the film you can still feel enjoy it somewhat as it still has the costuming, set design and sound effects we are used to.The films first act introduces the characters and does so a little clumsily, in fact the structure is a little all over the place. The characters are all likable though and well acted with Felicity Jones and Diego Luna being the stand outs the rebels. The second act has its moments but often stalls but the third act is quite excellent and even though this film is not a patch on The Force Awakens it does have much better aerial battles.The effects were as strong as you would imagine even with this one being a little too cgi heavy compared to The Force Awakens. Luckily though there was no cringe worthy Snoke cgi moments. However 'Mild Spoiler' the computer generated version of the long dead Peter Cushing once again playing Moff Tarkin from the original film, whilst getting much closer still has that uncanny valley effect that may be off putting. 'Spoiler finished'.There are a few Easter eggs in the film and a couple of Holy sh!t moments but I never felt as engaged as I wanted to. It did not quite live up to the promise but it is certainly a solid effort and no disgrace to the franchise. I still enjoyed the film and plan to see it again on IMAX.",Null,4,11,14 December 2016
Deadpool 2," Non spoiler review
","Deadpool 2 (2018, David Leitch)After the success of the first Deadpool after Fox gambled on an R rated super hero film with a lower budget in the X-universe, they have come back with another hard R rated chapter with only a slightly bigger budget. We see some old faces and some new characters with even some surprises. The film is well made and has amazing action and combat sequences that put the last couple of films in the MCU to shame.. take note Disney/Marvel... this is how you shoot combat. The film is also hilarious, for the most part matching the laugh hit-rate and almost the unexpected heart that the first film had. It is however a bloodier affair and that works well in this setting.I was worried that the change of director might negatively impact the film but it was a smooth transition to the new blood and this is most certainly the best superhero film of the year thus far and will be hard to beat.9/10",Null,2,5,17 May 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Fine for what it is....
","Thor: Ragnarok (2017, Taika Waititi) In last years mega-hit film 'Captain America: Civil War' we saw pretty much all of the earthbound Marvel characters turn up except Thor and The Hulk/Bruce Banner. So now its time for us to see what they have been up to in the meantime. New Zealand indie director Taika Waititi (What We Do in the Shadows) works with a budget for the first time to bring us the third entry in the Thor series that looks and feels more like a Guardians of the Galaxy film in many ways. We have a film set mostly in space and other planets with colorful and goofy characters everywhere and jokes inserted into every scene... but unlike Guardians and the other better MCU films.. this one lacks any emotional resonance.The story telling is a bit of a jumbled mess but tries to blow through plot points so fast that you might not notice. The action scenes are effects heavy but lack excitement, stakes or tension. Despite its many shortcomings though it is fast enough and funny enough to entertain throughout. The highlights for me were Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner and the director himself as a humorous side character names Korg. Hemsworth was great as always as Thor and Tessa Thompson did not disappoint as Valkyrie.The new thing that I noticed atmosphere wise was a much more interesting score than the traditional MCU films have had with a mostly Synth' based score composed by Mark Mothersbaugh (The Lego Movie), who is an unusual choice for score but it paid dividends. In the end the film is not a great film, nor a bad film but an inconsequential yet funny film.5.5/10",Null,10,26,26 October 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Abrams did his best to fix it
","To discuss this third film in the sequel trilogy one must go back to the last film (The Last Jedi) which was made by someone with disdain for Star Wars and it's fans. He created a 'film' that shat all over the set up of the first part of the trilogy and also did not advance the story or characters with any conceivable direction, essentially killing any momentum and depriving the trilogy of a second act.
So JJ Abrams had quite the task to undertake with not only this being the final film in the trilogy but the final film in the 'skywalker saga' and had no second act to build from.
Essentially what they have had to do is make two films worth of plot and cram it into one film which makes this an overly fast paced, choppy story that dies not have any quieter moments to balance it out. That said Abrams did what he could and I can happily report that he reversed every decision made in the last Jedi to one extent or another. It is obvious that Abrams hates that film and has gone out of his way to expunge it from having to be viewed at all. Now you can easily skip episode 8 and still get the whole story.
Despite it's many problems this film is visually stunning and returns to the characters having charming (although rushed) adventures. Also the one is back to natural junior rather than the bad Saturday Night Live parody type tone the last Jedi took and the film feels like Star Wars again.
There was much more Leia than I expected and it was handled very well with Carrie Fishers send off being very respectful. I did not love the ending but none of it was insulting and in the end taken in context of where the franchise had been left this was probably as good as we could hope for and I am somewhat satisfied.",Null,2,8,19 December 2019
Baby Driver," Baby Driver... the review
","After Writer/Director Edgar Wright (Hot Fuzz) departed Marvels Ant- Man film after working on it for eight years only to have Disney/Marvel wanting to make changes he decided to get straight back to work on an original film he had kicking around. This is that film about a young getaway driver (Ansel Elgort) who finds himself taking part in a heist doomed to fail, after being coerced into working for a crime boss (Kevin Spacey).This is a very different film for Edgar Wright with an all new cinematic language for him and a straighter less manic tone. The use of music in the film cannot be overstated as it is meshed into the story and is used as a way of telling the story of everything from the action to subtler moments. The film in many ways is a musical but not in the traditional sense. The first thirty minutes are wonderful cinema and while the rest of the film is good it doesn't reach the initial heights. In the end I admire Edgar Wrights creative attempts here to deliver a unique experience and to not rest on his laurels by trying some new things. However I do not think the end results (as admirable as they may be) quite live up to his consistent and wonderful body of work he has delivered prior.7/10",Null,0,1,20 July 2017
Dunkirk," Dunkirk (2017, Chris Nolan)
","I got to see this film in the IMAX theatre which is really by far the best way as unlike most other films that use IMAX cameras to heighten portions of the presentation, this one is almost all in the larger IMAX format with only a few dialogue scenes reverting back to the more traditional widescreen format. This is the story of allied soldiers from Belgium, the British Empire and France who are surrounded by the German army and evacuated during a fierce battle in World War II.The story is told from several points of view and it chops rapidly between them at a break-neck speed. I think Chris Nolan has taken on board some of the criticisms of past films for over waffling and un- needed length as this one is edited tight as a drum. Some may say there are not enough character moments but I feel there were enough to tell the story effectively. My grandfather was captured in this region during this time and was a prisoner of war for the remainder of the campaign. It is not lost on me what kind of hell these men went through and this film delivers that feeling. The score is amazing as was the sound design and I will be expecting Oscar nominations for both. I will reserve judgement till i see how it fairs on the home format without the IMAX treatment on whether it is Nolan's best film to date but it might bloody well be. 8/10",Null,7,10,30 July 2017
Avengers: Endgame," Non spoiler review
","Avengers: Endgame (2019, Russo Brothers)So the culmination of eleven years worth of set up in this Marvel Cinematic Universe that feels like an episodic tv series is about to have its finale and its a big one... over three hours. This film is sure to satisfy those who have been impressed with the last couple of phases of Marvel films, I personally gravitate towards the Phase One films. This direct sequel to last years Infinity War starts off quite slow for the first hour or so and I think this will be the main complaint by most people but I did not mind the low key hangs with these surviving characters. The film does pick up though and has a few laughs along the way, some above average action, fun hijinx but the whole time I am thinking this story is wasted on these terrible visual directors. Marvel films are all pretty bland but the Russos make spectacle so damn ugly. That said most of the conclusions are satisfying from a story point of view bar some small missteps here and there.",Null,7,23,24 April 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," so here it is...
","Avengers: Infinity War (2018, Anthony Russo, Joe Russo)This is a hard film to judge on its own merits with it being the conclusion of an 18 movie story arc. All the previous films good or bad had a solid story of their own with a traditional story telling format that sprinkled the connectivity and over reaching arc in towards the goal of The Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy facing Thanos. So this is the the film that concludes these sprinkles that were set in motion 10 years ago and is 100% not a film that can be watched by someone who has not seen all or at least most of the prior films. The MCU is basically a vert expensive tv show that way and also it mimics large cross over event comics which in my experience, the individual build up issues are better than the grand finale that brings everyone together and leaves little time for characters to shine as they are overstuffed. I think this is that overstuffed 'finale' but that is not to say that there is not plenty of other good and bad factors in this epic.The Russo brothers started with Captain America: Winter Soldier (2014) which showed their shortcomings in the action sequences (in particular hand to hand combat), from their they moved to Captain America: Civil War (2016) which had a better story with a more emotional finale and better but still imperfect editing and filming of combat sequences but was saved in this vein with a great action set piece in the middle (the airport scene) and a strong final and more personal battle. Two years on they have now brought us this, the third Avengers film which its action/combat scenes are 'mostly' quite bad... I really can't tell what's really happening in a lot of them.However despite being overstuffed and poorly made in some ways it is well paced with a great tone. It is not overly silly and jokey like some of the more recent Disney tentpoles (Thor: Ragnarok, The Last Jedi), instead it is more appropriately toned for the circumstances the characters find themselves with plenty of more natural humour between the more sombre moments. Another big plus is Josh Brolin as Thanos and the way the character is written. He is the only really fleshed out character in the film and he is a really great three dimensional foil who does not disappoint after such a huge build up. Another positive thing that surprised me was how the film was pretty much half Avengers and half Guardians of the Galaxy.I think James Gunn would have been a better choice as director for this film but it could have been a lot worse. In the end we have a massive film with almost every character from past films in the series that despite its technical flaws has a great last few minutes that would serve as an even more amazing exclamation mark/ full stop if we all did not realise that due to the way the economics of a successful franchise works that much of it will be undone somehow in the future.",Null,4,19,25 April 2018
Joker," joker
","Joker (2019, Todd Phillips)After the DC comics connected universe films came in under expectations (although still profitable), DC started planning out some stand alone films and Todd Phillips (Old School, The Hangover) approached them about doing a Joker film in a gritty style akin to The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver. With the film requiring a much lower budget than the usual superhero blockbusters it was green-lit.The talk for the subsequent years of production of it being something we have not seen in the realm of comic book movies before have proved correct, as we have a character study/ drama with this film. In that respect it is a refreshing change. The film is indeed a gritty feeling serious drama with a great central performance from Joaquin Phoenix (Her) that raises the film to another level.As far as the direction goes, the film looks good but my main issue is just how much it apes the two Scorsese films it is inspired by. Taking that tone is one thing but not only does this have similar story moments (also forgivable) but has shots/ scenes that feel duplicated. It will take film buffs out of the movie as they spot these pretty regularly throughout. So depending on how much the shameless aping of King of Comedy and especially Taxi Driver will bother you may effect your score. It bothered me a fair amount at times but I am sure it will bother others more than me and many less.That aside it is a good character study with a memorable lead performance and a welcome change to the mainstream box office. As far as the controversy over subject matter, the people who want to be outraged by things will find things in it to be outraged about but in the end it's just a movie and also it doesn't appear to endorse things has just present a fairly believable story.7.5/10",Null,2,6,3 October 2019
Wonder Woman," Best from the DC extended universe yet but still room for better
","Well the DCEU has got off to a pretty rough start but this long gestating Wonder Woman adaptation is a step in the right direction. For a start it feels like a real film, with time to set things up properly, character development and a color pallet that looks like a film rather than a de-saturated computer game. Not unlike Captain America: The First Avenger, this has a period setting that breaths some fresh air into it. Set in World War One, Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot)wants to end the great war and is surrounded by some interesting characters led by Chris Pine (Hell Over High Water) as the love interest. The third act is where it falls apart for me, it feels messy and the support characters are given very little to do. I can imagine a handful of scenarios that would have been more thrilling while sitting on my chuff for five minutes. Still on the whole this is a good adventure and hopefully we will see some good things from the Aquaman movie... I am not holding my breath on the Justice League film.",Null,3,10,1 June 2017
Black Panther," non spoiler review of black panther
","Black Panther (2018, Ryan Coogler)We first saw the African superhero 'Black Panther' in Captain America: Civil War and now we see him on his home turf and find out about the origins and history of the royal hero. The film itself is very afrocentric with a great and mostly black cast including Czhadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Forest Whitaker, Lupita Nyong'o and Angela Bassett as well as a a host of lesser known young talent. I was surprised to feel shades of a James Bond style adventure for the first act before it moved to something else but I did enjoy that while it lasted.One of the many things I like about this film is the tone as it deals with some pretty relevant and serious racial subject matter with respect and class. Also, where as many of the more recent Marvel films have gone for a more slapstick and one-liners approach, this film uses a more natural humour that does not take you out of the film but enhances it. It has a strong script that fleshes out a lot of the characters and makes their motivations believable and clear even when in unbelievable settings. At no stage are anyone's actions leaving you scratching your head and it is the strength of the script, characters and acting that helps one overlook the films few shortcomings.Where the film falters is in the action sequences and cgi. A lot of the special effects look unfinished or as if they might've been done ten or more years ago. The wardrobe design is excellent but some of the vehicle design could have been better. The worst offender for me though was the combat sequences which were often dark, overly edited and shaky. I was surprised at this because the director's boxing work on his film Creed (2015) was some of the best I have seen but here it was a mess. However the belief in the characters and what they are fighting for can still make you invested in these scenes despite their unpleasant presentation.All in all, I think this was a home-run for Marvel, yet again doing a great job with one of their lesser known comic book properties. I expect this film to do big business world wide and should please most as it feels like a real film, with real characters and stakes and not just disposable popcorn entertainment. It is a shame some of the special effects feel so rushed but I guess deadlines have to be met to keep the MCU juggernaut moving along and quality control will suffer here and there.7-7.5/10",Null,2,18,15 February 2018
Deadpool," They got it right with this one.
","Deadpool (2016) Directed by Tim Miller Cinema Ryan Reynold has tried to get this Deadpool film off the ground for 10 years as he is a big fan of the character and desperately wants to make amends for how the character was butchered in the now defunct timeline of X-Men Origins: Wolverine. It took the leaking of some old commissioned test footage that got comic fandom buzzing to finally get greenlit. Then Reynolds and co wisely settled for a very low budget so they could keep the film R rated and have delivered a film very authentic to its origins. For those unaware of Deadpool, he is a former Special Forces operative turned smart mouthed mercenary who is subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers, adopting the alter ego Deadpool. He is part of the Marvel universe or more specifically within big screen parameters, the X-Men universe. He is famous for being the one character who constantly breaks the fourth wall and speaks to the readers directly, or in this case viewers. Everything about his character is not the usual fare for superhero films which is half the reason he has never made it properly for this long. Reynolds was born for the role and he delivers with the help of a smart script that does not hold back and my shock many who are used to the PG super hero films of the last decade. The supporting cast are great too and include some familiar characters. There is no shaky-cam for the action which is great and it really delivers. The budget may have been quite low comparatively but it rarely shows except for in the special effect in a small part of the finale. This may end up being the funniest comedy of the year, the best action film of the year, the raunchiest R rated film of the year and it wouldn't surprise me if in a year when there are more high profile super-hero films coming out than ever before, that this ends up being at the top of that mountain too. This is a smaller film that does not need for their to be earth destroying consequences to give it gravitas. Much like Ant-man from last year the situation is smaller but the film has relationships set up and some heart as well but not unlike the Daredevil netflix show, the gloves are off here and they are way off and anything goes!",Null,3,13,11 February 2016
Alien: Covenant," Bit of a mess
","Alien: Covenant (2017, Ridley Scott)After Prometheus was released five years ago, the took was that the next chapter would follow the two surviving characters played by Michael Fassbender & Noomi Rapace back to the home world of the architects of the human race. However with Prometheus not doing as well as hoped and getting soft reviews plans have changed. What we have ended up getting is a messy hybrid of some of the ideas from the proposed Prometheus sequel and a much more familiar Alien film. This story follows the crew of a colony ship, bound for a remote planet who discover an uncharted habitable world that unfortunately contains some dangerous secrets and forces them to attempt a harrowing escape. The film is well enough made but not as visual a splendor as Prometheus was. The cast all do fair to good work with Danny McBride (Eastbound and Down) being the highlight.However the story is a real mess and the characters are under developed with mixed results on the design and set pieces. The computer generated aliens look good at times and not so much at others with their movements feeling too over the top and not grounded enough. For those who are fans of blood and gore, this one has plenty as well as some good tense moments but on the whole this film feels like a failure but they have another chance to get it right in 2019 with Alien: Awakenings.4.5/10",Null,11,25,11 May 2017
