Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Jaw-dropping special effects
","Although a little lacking on character development, it makes up for it with the incredible special effects and action sequences. The visuals, the abundant eye candy is what would make me watch this film again and again. I do have a few qualms though. The screen time for Darth Maul is seriously low, and that childish Jar Jar Binks character is someone I can really do without. But this I can say. It has the best special effects in any film (the pod racing sequence was jaw-droppingly good), and serves as a good opener for this amazing saga. I'll be lining up for Episodes 2 and 3 years later, that's for sure.",10,0,0,4 June 1999
