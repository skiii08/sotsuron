Frost_Nixon," The real thing?
","I watched this half-feature, half-docu-drama with mixed expectations. Why delve into the sordid past, unless you want to make a point about politics today?In 1974, Richard Milhouse Nixon resigned the US presidency to avoid impeachment over his involvement in illegal wire-tapping and spying on his political opponents, namely the Watergate scandal. Déjà vu? The film doesn't omit the fact that he was pardoned fully by his successor, Gerald Ford, although the Watergate interviews make it pretty clear Nixon was guilty as hell.Although he had been reelected by a landslide for a second term, to the liberal left 'Tricky Dick' was one of the most hated figures in pre-Bush US politics, for his conduct of the Vietnam War, and his reputation of dishonesty. Having seen the real Watergate interviews, I can see why -- it's hard to find anything positive in an Ex-president who squirms and wriggles this shamelessly in his attempts to dodge a straight question. The real-life interviewee Nixon lacks any of the brooding fighting spirit of his movie counterpart. He can be adequately summed up as the 'New Car Salesman of the Year', a homage Nixon earned in 1971. As this performance of this man was such an embarrassment, why resurrect and polish it for a movie? Does it bear any moral message, or is it an attempt to water down the impact of a president's 'wrong-doing' by turning him into just another human being?Judge for yourself. I found the real thing, the original interviews, a lot bolder and quite a bit more fascinating than this apparent look at the 'Making of'. Michael Sheen as Frost, the British interviewer, gives the impression of reenacting his 'Tony Blair' role from 'The Queen'. Nixon, the main course of the banquet, rules the screen because Sheen doesn't have any weight to throw around. The script stays remarkably close to the wording of the real interview -- watch them side by side and decide which one is more dramatic. In this case, life wins out over fiction by a mile.",6,1,5,9 February 2009
Requiem for a Dream," Why people die alone
","It's fun to read the 'Hate it' comments, and usually they have a point. Surely, this is a morality tale with worst-case-scenario ending, not a documental feature on drug abuse (for that, take a look at the German film 'Christiane F.') or an investigation into the American health care system (although after watching Michael Moore's 'Sicko', I think anything is possible).The comments I read all overlooked that this is a very moving film about loneliness and alienation - the best I've seen yet besides 'Blade Runner' and far above 'Collateral' and the like. If you watch a lot of movies, you'll get a spooky sense of the screen looking back at you. Ellen Bustyn as the mother lives inside an incoherent TV dream, until she completely vanishes into that 'brighter world' where she is not only loved, but adored. The kids have high hopes and seem to be more firmly on the ground, but Marion needs to pump up her courage and Harry loves to go easy. All three are junkies who keep the world at arms length or behind locked doors while they artificially enhance their feelings. They're not only addicted to uppers and downers, but to more-than-life-size dreams.By contrast, reality seems drab and without purpose and the individuals utterly alone. Like true average heroes of modern society, they are frantically trying to keep up happy, successful faces. Nobody takes the time to listen to or check on the old lady. The world doesn't care, and they in turn refuse to need it until it's too late and they lose limbs, minds, relationships, freedom, self-respect and finally the will to care.Jonathan Demme has laid a finger on a rift in society's fabric that's not easy to expose without boring the audience or adding thriller elements, and the shocking imagery gets more people to see it (as the comments confirm). Definitely a recommendable film that provokes nagging questions and engages even those who don't 'like' it.",9,2,3,25 August 2007
Star Trek," Something to take your kids to
","... I assume, not having the personal experience. To be that grotesquely over-rated, a sizable part of the world's teens must have voted for it ;-) Pros: This is what a new Star Wars movies should have been like - a cool hero, a not-to-geeky cast, a slice of sex, humor and lots, lots of explosions! - without needless blood and gore. The story isn't too bad either, although not particularly brainy or emotionally challenging. This is a character-driven movie.Cons: Well, for us ol'uns above thirty-five, the enjoyment lies in watching the kids have fun - there isn't really anyone or anything to identify with for boring grown-ups. I think I would have liked it - twenty years ago.",6,0,3,16 November 2009
The Last Legion," Gladiator meets (celtic) King Arthur
","I'd give this movie 6 and a half stars, it's a very watchable tale in the vein of 'Gladiator meets King Arthur'. Completely dreamed up, of course, and promoting a typically skewed view of the ancient world, but serious fans of Ancient Rome (like myself) shouldn't expect a big budget spectacle to be more interested in real history than Indiana Jones. It takes the ambition of an Oliver Stone to break up the usual mold of the 'heroic fantasy with modern political overtones' genre as defined by '300' and 'Gladiator'. Anyone interested in the facts can read up on Wikipedia. In short: Not much is known about the last Roman Emperor, Romulus Augustulus, besides that he was deposed and succeeded by the Germanic king Odoacer, as a child. Augustulus' father Orestes came from modern day-Yugoslavia, had served under Attila the Hun (now there's a story!) and usurped the Roman throne. In terms of old-fashioned 'Romanness' and claim to divine descent from the likes of Julius Caesar, Romulus Augustulus is about as true as the Roman legions of that time. But his (short?) life must surely have been interesting, and his vainglorious name embodies all the hope and hubris of an empire long past its prime.Other than historical names like Romulus, Orestes and Vortigern, the movie is entirely fictitious and in part attempts to rewrite the King Arthur Saga, complete with Ambrosinus/Merlin conjuring up fire out of thin air and a 'romanesque' version of Excalibur. Whether little Romulus, given his family background, would have seen Celtic emblems and rituals as anything other than barbaric hocus-pocus would be an interesting question. The historic Lord Vortigern, who is also said to have invited the Saxon invasion by settling the first Germanic mercenaries in Britain, is cast as a villainous celtic priest who wants to steal the fabled sword of Caesar from Romulus.Two things I did not like: The over-pretentious, occasionally boring music and the predictability. The main characters besides Romulus are action stereotypes - Not-Red-but-Black-haired Sonya falls in love with Die-Hard-Hero, and together they do what is right until destiny parts them, or not. Given that we know that little Romulus definitely didn't regain his lost throne, it's fairly hard for the story-writers to come up with a meaningful positive ending. So it's basically 'and they lived happily ever after'.Two things I did like: The costumes, the action and the overall making - nothing special, but not bad either - and the attempt to make something out of a neglected part of Roman history, if fictitious and by stealing other people's ideas, i.e. the Arthur Legend.",6,0,4,5 January 2009
JFK," A cinematic masterpiece - based on bogus history
","Even after more than 15 years, Oliver Stone's 'JFK' remains a stunning masterpiece of storytelling. Mixing reality and fiction, color and black & white snippets beyond the point of information overload, it's the precursor of ultra-rapid cut political thrillers like the 'Bourne Identity'. It is also a statement on the power of movies. Largely modeled after the book 'On the Trail of the Assassins' by Jim Garrison, the New Orleans prosecutor who provides the heroic figure for 'JFK' and has become famous as the only one who ever brought the Kennedy assassination to trial, it promotes the idea that the JFK case - maybe along with the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and even Martin Luther King - is really solved, if you watch/read the two in sequence. The book got a major interest boost from the film.According to various evaluations I found on the net, a majority of Americans actually take most of 'JFK's' assertions as facts, while of course expecting small artistic liberties. I did so myself, having read Garrison's book. One cannot help but wonder, if these 'facts' are true, why are they not investigated? There are entire websites devoted to 'debunking' conspiracy 'myths', but their common mistake is usually to make the reader angry or flatly refuse to acknowledge the validity of questions. On the other hand, would the alleged dark government forces really use such a bunch of losers for the hit of the century? Since Jim Garrison's book is the source of most of 'JFK's' claims, its credibility rests on Garrison's shoulders. The movie's hero is accused of pressurizing and even drugging witnesses, persecuting people for their homosexuality, wasting taxpayer's money etc. All of these claims seem ridiculous and are either attributed to a hostile press, a tired wife, a public won over by the Warren Report or government pressure... Garrison really had to fight all the demons of hell at once to get the truth out! Except that it wasn't really that way. Google up 'The Assassination Goes Hollywood!' for a step-by-step debunking of 'JFK' that doesn't make you mad at first glance. Delve deeper and the picture of Jim Garrison - and his times - changes entirely.One of the movie's most subtle, but most basic distortions is the claim that everybody believed in the Oswald 'myth' from the start, at the latest after the Warren Report. In reality, conspiracy 'myths' sprang to life almost instantly, and a large majority of the public was not satisfied with the official explanations, just like today. Garrison wasn't the only one 'investigating' and speculating, not even the most vocal. Public pressure eventually forced a commission to re-investigate the facts.Numerous books have been written on the Garrison trial: 'False Witness' by Patricia Lambert and 'American Grotesque' by James Kirkwood, among others. 'Garrison has made a comeback that would have made Richard Nixon proud', writes a commentator. They all conclude that Garrison whitewashed his investigation and misrepresented important details of the trial (errors that were faithfully repeated - and artfully inflated - by Oliver Stone). Garrison tried for years and failed, not because of a small missing piece of evidence for a 'guilty' verdict, but because in reality, the jurors thought he had no case - absolutely nothing to credibly back up even the smallest of his claims, which had grown ever more sensational over time. The press, who would have loved anything spectacular, had abandoned him before the trial was over. Serious reporters and conspiracy buffs alike didn't take him seriously anymore. It took 'JFK' to resurrect him.There remains the issue of - the real - Clay Shaw, who looks guilty as hell on screen. The movie states before the end credits roll that CIA director Richard Helms later admitted that Shaw had worked for the CIA. That's not true. All Shaw was ever 'convicted' of was being homosexual, which was confirmed by some of his acquaintances, and that he owned some sadomasochistic equipment. Count the number of homosexual suspects in the movie, and the claim that Garrison believed in a 'gay plot' looks less incredible. Whatever Garrison may have thought, Shaw's forced 'coming out' cost him dearly in social status. Shaw (and Ferry) are dead now. Is it true that in the United States, the laws of defamation apply only to the living? Memory is fleeting, film is forever.On the whole, all of 'JFK's' central claims turn out to be pure myths, yet there is hope that some day one version of what really took place will be generally accepted, and it will be the right one. The merit of any controversial film is that it encourages discussion - and maybe research on the part of the viewer. There is nothing wrong with purely enjoying a good movie, as long as it's taken with a grain of salt.",8,7,24,30 December 2007
The Lives of Others," Another victim of self-importance
","I haven't seen any German films since 'Der Untergang' (2004) about Hitler's last days which was fairly good, atmospheric and believable. 'Das Leben der Anderen' is something else, a mixture of farce and the very cramped German approach to 'serious' subjects. Actors make up for lack of performance by over-emphasizing their dialogue.English viewers may not properly 'appreciate' the fine-turned original that made me feel like I was hearing a book reading - no living Teuton naturally talks or has ever talked like that, not even our venerated grandparents. The actors pronounce every chosen line as carefully as on stage, which adds to the painful artificiality of the whole. I abandoned this over-rated attempt after 30 minutes - there are better ways to waste time and learn about the STASI. Two stars are for performance, the third for the content - you can take it as a radio play. The fourth is for the subject.",8,9,31,12 August 2007
Children of Men," A film Stanley Kubrick should have made...
","... although I don't quite get what it's about, apart from the obvious. I'll give it a whopping 10 stars out of 10, just for being so radically different from the usual sterile and/or infantile crap on screen, especially in fiction films.Most fans of the book appear to be disappointed with the movie. One commenter praised the book as 'profoundly religious', which to me isn't exactly an appetizing label  rather the opposite. Instead, speeches and moral statements are totally absent from the film, realism and immediacy rule. The film does a very nice job in bringing its one (ligitimate) 'religious' issue across: the miracle of human procreation. If it has a message, it is: Down with racism, blind faith and intolerance, Stop killing each other, and Try Not To F**k Up Humanity. Thankfully, these 'messages' are implied and not preached with finger-pointing. The action benefits from leaving much to the attention of the viewer, rather than explaining loose beginnings or ends. A good fiction film is like getting thrown into strange and murky waters and enjoying the drift. So those interested in the whole story will surely watch it over, or buy the book.It's a wonder this thing avoided the Hollowwood swamps of stereotypes and platitudes! Its saving grace must be in the down-to-earth 'British touch' and/or the director's Mexican heritage. I wouldn't believe this same director made 'Harry Potter', but documentaries  yes, definitely. The creators deserve praise not only for the realistic representation of shabbiness, squalor and violence, but for showing us believable human beings, which is a rare thing especially in 'action' films.All in all, nine stars for the experience, and one for the guts to make something that's surely not to everybody's taste.",10,2,6,20 December 2008
Downfall," Important and controversial
","Although it's a good film, it was just as interesting to read the comments  especially from Germany. It's true, whenever a film such as this comes out portraying the Third Reich not as an Indiana Jones-type Empire of Evil, we Germans turn around in advance protesting: 'This is not meant to justify anything! Of course Hitler was a monster!' I don't think anyone seriously judges young Germans today by what their great-grandparents did, but it's of course something never to be forgotten. Sadly, it's also a convenient stereotype in politics and movie-making that tends show demons instead of humans, with the effect that we no longer understand just how on earth such things were possible. Hopefully it will take a very long time before the Nazis are surpassed in evil. But closing our eyes to the real Hitler, Stalin or Mao and their minions in favor of a legend will prevent us from ever understanding how these things work. 'If you look into the Abyss, it looks back into you' (Nietzsche?). Movies like this one challenge the viewer's ability to look and do some honest self-reflection, or we all might wake up one day to the same bad realization, that we chased a dream and killed millions along the way.'The Downfall' suggests how hard it was to be an outsider and not be affected by Nazi propaganda, and how well Hitler had managed to brainwash his troupe, especially the SS, into believing Germany was to be Sparta reincarnated, whose code of honor called upon everyone to fight to the death and without mercy. He ruled his admirers by being the source of their ideals (read: delusions of grandeur), pride, hope and fear. Bruno Ganz has justly been praised for his performance, and what he did was just enough  to make Hitler more mesmerizing as well as menacing would have invited unnecessary criticism. But imagine for once Anthony Hopkins in that role  the outcries of indignation! And the stacks of fan letters ...! (Hopkins actually played Hitler on TV in dark pre-Lecter times.) This Hitler is rather funny in his spitting and raving.I was often annoyed by the kitschy music when suffering civilians and wounded are shown  scenes like these are stronger without it  and also by the urge to show 'good' Germans, in the moral sense of the word. Not one of them, except the SS commandos hanging 'traitors' in the streets, is fanatic enough to be entirely unsympathetic. There are some really memorable quotes by Hitler which serve as historical cues: 'Mercy is a crime against the people' is the most remarkable. Juliane Köhler is striking as Eva Braun  she speaks volumes with her eyes, as is Magda Goebbels (Corinna Harfouch) who kills her children in cold blood (and allegedly had a thing for Hitler, but that's subtle in the film)  the 'bravest mother of the Third Reich' indeed, by Hitler's standards! Joseph Goebbels, apart from a superficial resemblance, remains bland and not half the intellectual, charismatic orator he really was, and the rest of the cast is not particularly impressive either. The film's atmospheric moments are inside the bunker, when a grenade hits and suddenly the wild merriment stops, and you feel a claustrophobia and sense of dread that makes the goings-on seem like a mad fever dream. That was when I felt the fiction was real.Some commentators have called this the best WW2-movie they ever saw. It's maybe the most complex recent 'big screen' issue about Germany's Hitler madness  so far. My 'favorite' is a Russian film (I can't recall the title) that shows what Germans  and Russians  did on the Eastern front, mostly seen through the eyes of a Russian boy whose village is burned down with its inhabitants locked inside the church, to which the SS set fire. Though not as grisly in detail as 'Saving Private Ryan', it depicts the events Hitler's 'table talk' set into motion in all their bestiality and without all false sentimentality. We should not forget that most of the war victims besides Jews were Russians, and for the latter the killing was far from over after 1945. They have their own story about killing for ideology or conformity that I'd really like to see made into a film as challenging as this one.",7,4,6,18 August 2007
Prometheus," I liked the geologist
","I don't have much to add to what the best-voted amateur critics have already been screaming about, only that it wasn't as bad as I was expecting. I went to a see it fortified against the underwhelming 'sciency' bits, the bad character and plot writing, the ridiculous end of the 'surgery' scene etc. If you grant that this movie is fantasy eye-candy, not sci-fi - because it seems anything interesting in that department comes from the left field, like Danny Boyle's 'Sunshine' and Duncan Jones's 'Moon' - it's possible to find something enjoyable besides the predictably great visuals. Looking at it from a certain social angle helps.Everyone - yeah, really - is complaining how unlikable/unlikely the characters are. That's true, but it hasn't kept me from rooting for them, even if it was equally or more enjoyable to watch them get bumped off. Obviously these guys are interchangeable parts in a highly competitive, dehumanized corporate environment, with a genuine butt for a boss who openly wants the mission to fail, so she probably didn't pick the brightest spoons in the set to begin with. Nothing new here - take the 1980's anti-big corporation meme that Alien 1 made so fashionable and apply it to a set of scientologists (oops, the script calls them scientists) instead of a glorified flying warehouse crew. In space no-one hears you complain now, whether you're working class or intellectual snob. Is it any wonder these folks are so messed up? I hereby admit being one of the two persons who liked the geologist, he's sort of the anti-hero in this social nightmare by being so human, and such a dumb ass. Verily, there are no role models aka easily identifiable 'character arc' clichés, which you can take as bad writing or meant deliberately. None of them is particularly interesting, but I felt like I knew or remembered these people from a bad dream involving my future career prospects. Many of us may feel we're surrounded by morons a lot of the time, but we still have to get along with them, so probably 'Prometheus' is dual wish fulfillment for me, empathizing with the people you're stuck with and waiting to see them get surgically removed. I found all the 'erratic' behavior totally convincing, that's how real people function.Speaking of removal, what bothered me unexpectedly was the bad self-quotation - the 'Ripley' log entry - at the end. Quoting yourself means you're really getting old. Hey, I'd almost forgotten Ridley Scott did the first Alien movie (irony intended). With all its flaws 'Prometheus' has enough original ideas to stand for itself, a different (predictably female) heroine and thrust. Since it seems preordained we shall some day see part 2 of this story, I hope the Ripleygrams stay at a minimum or disappear altogether, like in a future 'Director's Cut' that for once cuts what shouldn't be in there. Giger's alien emerging from between a superhuman caucasoid and a giant squid is enough of a tease to make me watch the Alien series again, one day.",6,1,5,1 August 2012
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Disappointing German voice acting in Special Edition (DVD)
","One of my favorites of the original Star Wars Trilogy, and I know every line by heart in German and English.George Lucas, of course, couldn't keep his fingers entirely still, and when I talk about it now I mean the latest DVD version of the Special Edition. But compared to its sequels, it is the one that has gained the most from CGI.German fans, unfortunately, have to put up with the rather destructive efforts of re-dubbing Darth Vaders voice in two little scenes with seven dialog lines: his conversation with the emperor and another scene at the end of the movie. The original German voice, Heinz Petruo, had unfortunately died in 2001. But even so, all that needed to be added was one sentence: Vader: 'How is that possible?' The studio didn't use its sophisticated mix-mastering equipment to rework the original tapes, move the other six sentences around a little and get a guy that, with a few audio filters, sounded roughly like the original voice to speak those four words. They did a completely new dub. It proves the engineer knew how to apply filters, but the voice acting is best described as talentless, and the manager who hired him should only do commercials.Now, Mr. Lucas, which number was I supposed to call if I'm not satisfied with sound quality?On the other hand, I think he deserves more praise than he got (at least from me) for his efforts to preserve the magic of the trilogy. I recently had the rare opportunity to watch a 'genuine' Laserdisk edition of the original movie. It's closer to the real cinema experience because there is no PAL speedup, which produces a slightly slower pacing and darker voices (something NTSC viewers are not aware of). But even with the lower image resolution, it had noticeably aged. The stop motion animation looks jerky, the spaceships too static, color mismatch and compositing lines jump into view, things we never noticed - because they could not be done better at the time. All these things were fixed in the Special Edition. So without the remarkable devotion of mastermind George Lucas, the first three Star Wars films in their original form would be slightly dusty 'classics' today, like Flash Gordon or the Frankenstein films, with special effects that look occasionally funny.George Lucas kept the trilogy alive for a new generation. Still, the originals preserve movie history. They breathe the flavor of the 70s and 80s in their sound effects and interior designs, and their inferior technical quality serves to draw attention to atmosphere, acting and story - at least for me, it was never mere fascination with special effects. They only serve as make-believes.Without history, there is nothing to look back to.",7,0,3,22 February 2008
V for Vendetta," Elrond behind a mask
","The political overtones surely make this worth watching. Good performances and interesting story. The one thing I did not like was Huge Weaving's voice. Throughout the movie it never varies in its (non-)expression and eloquence - like an endless lecturing monologue by Elrond. It never suggests a human being with emotional ups and downs behind the mask, except for one scene where V cries. A beautiful voice and admirable performance in the 'Matrix', but a set-back for this movie - not the voice, but the style. I'm a great fan of his, but he should have tried to convey more than hate and determination and show a few defining 'cracks' in the V character. Of course it would be a little out of focus - it's a too-simple superhero movie -, but more interesting.",6,0,7,15 August 2007
