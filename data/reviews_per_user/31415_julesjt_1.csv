Miracle," What a Miracle
","This film was a Miracle. Herb Brooks and his boys are the Miracles.As I love Ice Hockey I picked this movie out to watch purely on this alone.Once I watched it I watched it again. It made me believe. I guess just like Herb Brooks. Once I had finally watched it millions of times, I then researched the back ground and have throughly enjoyed every aspect of this movie and readings since.I think this movie really depicts what working together towards a common goal can be achieved even against the odds and that if you really want to work towards something better or be the best at your chosen sport or occupation, it can be done, as long as your heart is in it.Over all the movie was inspiring and heart warming. I wish that more movies could be made with this intensity.",10,1,2,22 May 2006
