Black Swan," a bit disappointing.
","Black Swan is about a ballet dancer that wins the lead role in 'Swan Lake' for being perfect one half of the performance. In trying to achieve perfection for the complete performance, she loses her mind while trying to embrace the darker side of her ballet character.In a nutshell, Black Swan was very disappointing. If there is a proper film industry name for 'over directing' I would apply it to this film. There was such an effort to create an odd style to the movie, they neglected to properly tell the story. I never cared about the lead character Nina Sayers, nor did I appreciate the eventual success in the end. I never cared about her relationship between her and her mother, nor did I care about the other supporting characters in her life. Why? Because, the filmmaker didn't take his time to deeply develop the any of them. Nina, was perfect as the white swan, but the audience had to accept that because her ballet director Thomas Leroy said so. She not perfect for the Black swan because the director Said so. The dance performances were often done in angles where we the audience couldn't really see or understand. Secondly, the movie was more focused on style than story. Excessive shaky camera movements, erotic scenes that were over the top, and paranormal scenes that really seemed out of place for this movie, seemed to be the main focus of the director. Yes, the final dance performance in the end when film allowed the audience see her how she visioned herself was superb, but I enjoyed the scene without caring much about her achievement. In the end, I felt like: 'so what' 'Is this a movie worthy of so much buzz?' Certainly not, in my opinion.",5,0,1,8 May 2011
