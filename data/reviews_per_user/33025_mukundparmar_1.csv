Airlift," Makes you feel proud to be Indian.
","Although I have never been to India, being an Indian this film made me feel proud to be one. Excellent acting and great story. Nimrat Kaur was just dashing in her role. And Akshay Kumar as always was superb.The ending was a bit rushed up but that did not matter because the entire film was explicitly thrilling.Viewers will literally feel a sense of sympathy for the Indians trapped in Kuwait. This shows how well the movie is presented.Overall, a great film. Must watch as this is one of Akshay's best!",10,7,11,22 January 2016
