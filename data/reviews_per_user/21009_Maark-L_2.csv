Hereditary," Pathetic overrated nonsense
","What a phenomenal mess of a movie. For a plot they just flipped thru a deck of horror tropes and pulled cards at random. The movie became progressively worse and meaningless the further it went on.Zero of the characters are likable or sympathetic.
The ending is so lame as to be anything but literally laughable.
This movie makes Suicide squad looks like the Avengers.
Seriously, what were the critics thinking?",1,2,6,14 January 2019
Passengers," I belive this is the best movie i've ever seen!
","I absolutly love the plot. ItÂ´s beautifully made, and the acting is great. This movie has it all, comedy, action, romantic et.c I cant see anyone dislike a movie like this, they how does is swanky 'i know it all, and the best movies where made during the early 1940s' kind of people. I could have watched this movie for 10 more hours, seeing their whole life on the spaceship. its amazing and desserve a lot more cred!
