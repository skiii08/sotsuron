Captain Phillips," Really?
","I really appreciate Tom Hanks as an actor, so when I go to the Redbox and look for something to rent that could be a decent film, I can kind of count on anything he's in to be at least watchable and worth my time. However, this film frustrated me. Mostly because this actually happened in real life and it didn't need to happen. Then, then they add insult to injury by making a movie out of it. Here's why I am scratching my head over this...The shipping line, the US Navy and US government are aware there is piracy constantly happening off the coast of Africa. Yet, these large cargo ships head out there without any protection. They cannot expect the crew to be guards/mercenaries/troops, etc. Fair enough. However, why not avoid a hijacking in the first place by hiring a few trained professionals to handle a potential problem? Seems so simple to do that. All the time I am watching two motor boats with about 8 guys go after a big ship I'm thinking, 'what? can't they take care for his situation easily? Aren't prepared for this? Don't they have someone on board to take these peons out?' Apparently not. Instead, the Navy et al have to get involved, potentially jeopardizing lives, spending tax payers money, etc because those in charge did not take precautions. It made me more angry and annoyed than sympathetic. About 1/3 into the film I had to stop watching because I thought the whole notion they DIDN'T hire anyone to safeguard them was the dumbest move ever! I lost all interest at that point. Note to shipping lines...hire a few key personnel to safeguard your ship so something like 'Captain Phillips' doesn't have to happen.",Null,2,5,24 January 2014
