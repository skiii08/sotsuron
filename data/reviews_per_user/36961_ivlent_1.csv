Requiem for a Dream," Very mixed feelings
",I think the movie is very beautiful but at the end of the movie I was shaking and crying! Never had that before! So I have very mixed feelings about this film. It took me over an hour to get back to life. At first I gave this movie a 4 but I changed it today.,7,0,1,29 December 2003
