Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," George Lucas hasn't directed a movie in 20 years - and it shows.
","We saw it yesterday night...  don't get your hopes up...  warn your friends!ill-conceived & executed plot + horrific dead pan screenwriting + bad acting & directing + lack of in-scenario historical continuity + good but over-used special effects + catering to nursery school audienceeven without comparison to the previous films in the series, this film just cannot stand up on its own.  contrary to those that give george lucas benificence of the doubt, good films actually do require good stories or stunning visuals.  Even regarding stunning visuals, the film does not deliver that much that is new.   e.g. Roger Ebert asserts that  'There are new places here--new kinds of places.'  However, this is not true.  there really isn't much new that we haven't seen before in other films -- 'There are new places here--new kinds of places. Consider the underwater cities, floating in their transparent membranes. [as seen in the Abyss] The Senate chamber, a vast sphere with senators arrayed along the inside walls. . . [as seen in Dark City]'at best this is a very mediocre film with some interesting special effects. Please someone tell George et al to assemble new talent and better writers that will collectively be able to pull off the next two.",4,0,1,21 May 1999
