The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," the film fantastic and is a very good adaptation of the book by Tolkien
","This is my favorite film after the two next parts. I could say that in three long hours Jackson has made a well resume of the book. It has so much fantasy and is a wonderful way to tell the beginning of one of the greatest and magical stories ever told, written or filmed. It is about one hobbit named Frodo who guesses that he has a coursed ring and has to destroy it into the fires of a far volcano. A hobbit is a kind of dwarf.The movie has a charmed soundtrack and the especial effects and the sound effects are just fantastic. I recommend to go and see it now.David RodrÃ­guez Sancho",9,2,3,7 November 2005
