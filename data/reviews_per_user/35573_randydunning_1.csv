First Man," Very disappointed.
","Way too many close ups. Too much shaky camera. Terrible soundtrack. Lazy acting. This is possibly the worst film I have seen in theaters in the last 20 years. A guy in our theater fell asleep and was snoring loudly through most of the second half. No one cared enough to wake him up. I should have taken a nap too. Would have been a better use of my time. My wife and I were left so empty after this dirty, wet mop of a movie. We went home and watched Apollo 13 to remind us what great acting and filmmaking is.",2,9,15,17 October 2018
