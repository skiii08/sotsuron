Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Could have been better - but only slightly
","I had three days to digest this movie. Let me tell you why I didn't write the review right away: the movie put me off from the start, and I barely recovered by the end of it. Don't get me wrong: I loved the character on Da Ali G show - I have been watching the episodes since they first appeared on cable. That is why I was anxious to go see the movie. But he went terribly wrong in the opening sequence. His shtick as being from the most backward place in the world works as long as he doesn't make it real. When he uses it only as a reference in his skits, to make the situations even more humorous, it creates a surreal, abstract idea of that 'Weird Kazakhstan' country. It works because this detached and abstract image is obviously not meant to offend Kazakhstan. Rather it is a tool to make fun of U.S. and A. BUT, making it real, making us actually a witness to the going-ons in the village of Borat - well that kills it for me! That opening scene made me so embarrassed, so surprisingly uncomfortable, that I suddenly had a jolt of fear rip through me: Is this the sign of things to come? This is going to be horrible! Well, thankfully I was wrong, 90% wrong that is. The movie went on with the usual wit and prickly humor that made it so special in the first place. I loved most of the scenes that dealt with bigotry, hate, and uproarious naked spectacle that is human nature. At its best, this movie is a study in sociology, psychology, and anthropology all at the same time. Unfortunately, at its worst it is gross physical humor more suited to fraternity boys. This occasional swing to the realm of 'Jackass' marred the otherwise flawless intellectualism of this movie. I also felt that most of the editing that was done to emphasize the point - i.e. make it seem more exaggerated than it really was (such as ALL New Yorkers were shown as rude and unfriendly - as if he didn't encounter a SINGLE one who was nice to him) - should have been done in moderation. It was obvious that scenes were edited to serve the purpose of the movie - which would have been fine - to an extent. However, the dosage we get in this movie puts everything Cohen did in America in doubt. A sort of 'How much DID they cut out to make this scene work?' Thus DEFEATING the very premise of the movie - that we are supposed to BELIEVE that everyone in the represented group would always behave in the same exact fashion. Nonetheless, what makes this movie work on the whole is it's ability to create an urgent need for someone in the movie to go 'Borat, what the heck is WRONG with you?' But no one ever does! And that's the greatest thing of all! Well - one star off for the wrong opening, one star off for the frat boy comedy, and one star off for the editing. And this movie is getting the most solid 7 stars - leaning towards 8.",7,1,6,7 November 2006
The Bourne Identity," Entirely watchable and enjoyable film
","I am a fan of spy thrillers and mystery genre in general.  However, I am always wary of Hollywood cliche movies that leave you unsatisfied if not aggravated.  This film is a refreshing and enjoyable exception.  The cast is picked masterfully and plays great together.  Strong performances from Matt Damon and Franka Potente leave you breathless.  What I was on a look out for is a shallow dialogue, thinking the movie will focus primarily on action scenes and chase sequences.  I was pleasantly surprised by the delicate balance of both.  You do have moments where you wonder if the script could have been improved a little bit, because of the improbability of events (I am talking about the obvious stupidity of certain agents that chase Jason and gaps and holes in CIA surveillance in general).  You have numerous questions and concerns as to could that really have happened, but once you get over that little obstacle, be prepared to be entertained.  Go see it in the theaters.",8,0,1,16 June 2002
Revolutionary Road," Uneven performances and dialogue, but solid overall
","The story is complex, emotional, multi-layered, and quite smart. Unfortunately it does not always translate in the acting, dialogue, or even the setting of the shot. I like all the actors in this movie, but sometimes Leo and Kate deliver their lines as two actors on the stage in a local production - just not convincing enough. The dialogue sometimes is too predictable, with flatness both in words and delivery. However, neither of these are so often as to ruin the movie. So overall the effect is still impressive. Michael Shannon is the only one deserving real praise - and rightly getting nominated for Oscar. A solid performer, but won't be remembered several years down the road, and is NOT the best of the decade.",7,1,1,16 January 2011
The Departed," Short of a Masterpiece?
","This movie makes you speechless. As my boyfriend put it: Nothing short of a work of genius. Every single actor has played superbly. There was never a faulty moment when you felt that it was overplayed or underplayed. Of course, as you leave there are numerous unanswered questions, but not the kind where you would want to poke wholes in the plot. In fact, there was no real plot where there was a definitive 'Start, middle, finish'. It was a very complex, intricate development of human relationships that makes you both associate and separate from the movie. And in fact, I loved that ending was not your regular Hollywood type ending - made me fell like there is still art to be had from the big motion picture producers.",9,0,1,8 October 2006
Ice Age," FUN FUN FUN
","I saw it with a friend of mine.  Imagine two grown ups sitting in the theater full of kids and toddlers and laughing even more than them.  Well that shows two sides of the story. First, the movie is really cute and funny.  But, second, truth be told, jokes are a bit grown up.  Carefully timed and executed references to things that adults would recognize elicited well deserved giggles and chuckles from the moms and dads, leaving children wondering what the fun is all about.  But, in the next scene, the never failing smash into the wall leaving an outline cutout had those kids rolling with laughter.  Overall, I do think it sits well with all ages.  It delivers what it promises, by which I mean entertainment and lightheartedness. Definitely worth it!",8,2,3,24 March 2002
