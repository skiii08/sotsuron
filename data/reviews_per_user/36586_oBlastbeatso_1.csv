Sucker Punch," A visually stunning action adventure.
","Quite honestly, I think anyone going into this film has high expectations. Let's face it, the hype has been huge. In my opinion, Sucker Punch delivered exactly what it said it would: a visually stunning action adventure. This movie met my expectations exactly.There will always be those that it will be impossible to please and will give this movie a low rating. We're not breaking script barriers here and creating some deeply obscure plot with twists. I think Sucker Punch was more about the visuals and less about the story. That's not to say the story was bad, but the focus is definitely on the visuals. I think quite frankly, you either love this movie or hate it. I think the actors and actresses portrayed their roles perfectly. I would definitely suggest going to see this move in the theater to truly experience it in it's full element.If you appreciated the visuals of Watchmen and 300, you will definitely want to catch this movie.",9,5,11,26 March 2011
