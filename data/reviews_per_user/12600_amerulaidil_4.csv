Ford v Ferrari," Now that's a racing car movie!!!
","Plot writing was great from start to finish. They didn't missed every detail from the truth event. They told the story perfectly from point A to B. The character development was great for Carroll Shellby and Ken Miles character. I'm not sure about Leo Bebee character cause I found him just another cliche movie villain. The dialogue written perfectly well.The cast performance was great and engaging. Matt Damon and Christian Bale did a great job as their character. I really enjoyed their chemistry in this movie. They nailed their character perfectly without any flaws.The action sequence was great and perfectly shot. No CGI,no shaky cam, and not messy cut. That's what I can describe for the racing scene. You really need to experience better on cinema by the way.The cinematography looks beautiful especially during the Le Man's race scene.Overall, this is probably best racing car movie since Rush.",9,6,16,14 November 2019
Captain Marvel," It's fun and enjoyable movie.
","Plot writing was great and powerful. For those who haven't watched it yet, this movie is more to finding identity, not journey to become a superhero. So you need a full attention and patience throughout because it's more to exploring Carol Danvers character. The movie also contained a surprising plot twist. The dialogue writing was great. The movie doesn't contain any cringe worthy dialogue writing.The cast performance was great. Brie Larson really prove me wrong here. She's really great as captain marvel. Samuel L Jackson also did a good job as Nick Fury. Ben Mendelson also give a great as Talos. Let's not forget about Goose the cat who completely stole some spotlight from the main actors.Overall,I think it's fun and enjoyable superhero origin movie. Don't believe any negative reception about this movie.",8,8,24,7 March 2019

",Plot writing was great and powerful. It's something you don't see in every animation movie. One thing I love about this movie is they put a lot of depth and heart in this movie.

All the characters are very likeable and relatable. I think this movie will be great example to all Hollywood studios .,10,2,4,7 March 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Thank You, Marvel
","This is best superhero movie that I ever watch. The storyline was great and powerful with its emotion weight and great treatment to all the characters.

The movie also bring us to the journey where you can remember the movie what it's supposed to be. 30 years from now, I guarantee that you will introduce and share the love of this movie to your child or grandchild.",10,2,5,25 April 2019
