Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," One More Chance
","It's not too big a leap to assume that most people reading this review are Star Wars fans like myself, and that the consensus of fans' opinion is that Phantom Menace is not George Lucas' best work.In that perspective, we love Star Wars and we are prepared to tolerate any number of failures in the hope that there might be another masterpiece, just maybe. But George will have to review the lessons learned from his mistakes.The weakness of the movie is not due to lack of effort; on the contrary, one of its problems is that it tries too hard - so much expectation had been built. It has a massive reliance on special effects - a really bad idea - and you need a microscope to find the storyline.It should not be hard to remember that Anakin is Darth Vader but the characterisation and script are so poor that we find we are constantly forgetting who the kid is. And which one of those robed gentlemen is Obe-Wan? And throwing in familiar characters without any build-up, like they had just shown up on the day and had to be squeezed in to the filming schedule?Go for it, George - Episode II has come and gone and is only a little better - you may only have one more shot at it. Bring in some decent dialogue writers to help. Get yourself a good story and have it checked out before you spend the next gazillion dollars. And don't fret too much over the special effects.",Null,0,1,11 September 2002
Amadeus," In that moment, I knew...
","When we observe a painting by Van Gogh, it may be just oil on canvas. We could do something similar, surely? We have eyes, and we can hold a paintbrush - just apply the right colour in the right places. What more is needed?And Mozart, what is necessary to create music similar to his? Salieri could sit at a keyboard and work the keys, plink plonk. He knew which notes go together and which don't. He knew a good tune from a bad one...And Forman, and Schaffer. They made a movie: Amadeus... Simple... perhaps anyone could do it with a bit of practice? You get a nice adequate budget and professional actors. Go to some interesting places, direct the camera and away you go?Yup, I'm taking a while to get to the point, dear reader, but since you are exploring these comments, it's quite likely that you love this movie dearly as I do. I'm pushing at an open door. We are revelling in the knowledge of genius.Forman and Schaffer may not be geniuses in Mozart's league - who could be? - but they still created this masterpiece of a movie to enrich our lives.
Oh, and while we're at it, let's say Thank You to F. Murray Abraham, eh?I would welcome a dialogue on Amadeus.",10,2,4,29 August 2001
Titanic," Just Add Water
","Ok, I borrowed that phrase from a person called Red Elvis but it was too good to ignore for this formulaic recipe.Mix together a bunch of cliches. Boy meets girl. Boat meets iceberg. Add social and ethnic stereotypes by the shovel. Stir in a heap of stodgy dialogue and a lot of very good and expensive special effects.Add a million gallons of salty water and what do you get? A mess that will make you nauseous.",1,22,46,12 March 2003
Titanic," Sank Like a Stone
","Titanic:Number one box office takings of all time, by a mile. Special effects better than any other movie, ever.And nowhere to be seen on the IMDB voters' top 250.Why the disparity? Because Special Effects do not a Movie Make, and cannot cover the cracks in the pedestrian plot and the cardboard characterisation.The ultimate reputation of this film has been sunk not by an iceberg but a similarly immovable object; the judgment of movie-lovers.",1,21,44,20 December 2001
Blade Runner," Time Warp
","I saw this at the movies when it first came out, thinking: 'It's based on a great book and it's got Harrison Ford in it... we can't go far wrong here.'Naturally I was very disappointed at the time since the movie gave very little respect to the book.Recently I watched it again, thinking that perhaps it has improved with age. On the contrary, it's futuristic pretensions are laughable and the movie can be carbon-dated to 1982: already-out-of-date-punk-rock and early 1980's fashions.Then I read the book again ('Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?') aka Blade Runner. Still a fascinating read. Do yourself a favour; save 15 dollars and buy the book rather than the DVD.",Null,0,1,21 December 2001
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The Rest Writes Itself...
","I have spent some time commenting on lesser movies and it suddenly occurred to me... hey, I could comment on Star Wars! It's like playing football at your local park and then suddenly being picked for England. People might even read my comments, as you are doing now...To get to the point, in 1977 my pal invited me along with his kid sister to see this movie. I'm 18 years old, I'm not expecting much, I hadn't paid much attention to the hype, but we did make the extra effort to go to see it at The Odeon in Leicester Square, a big cinema in the centre of London which I had never visited before.In we went and I'm already taken aback by the sheer size of the theatre and the screen... we are quite close to the front. I'm already very impressed. Then the opening titles spring up, the huge sound system bursts to life, John Williams unparalleled orchestral masterpiece.And then the sound, shaking the whole theatre, rumbling, you can feel it in your diaphragm. The gigantic star ship looms majestically into view from the top of the screen, it is huge, you are there in space looking at it...It took me about two minutes to draw a breath and the rest writes itself.
I saw the movie again only last week on one of the movie channels on Sky satellite and it was as big and bold as ever. Still 100 percent watchable.The sequels... at time of writing The Empire Strikes Back is a very creditable number 17 in the IMDB voters chart and Return of the Jedi at 117. Phantom Menace is not in the top 250. Clearly the echoes are growing fainter so let's hope Mr. Lucas can maybe give us one more really good one from the remaining two?",10,0,0,21 December 2001
