Angels & Demons," Once again, the movie is not as good as the book.
","The movie is not as good as the book! That's all I want to say as a big fan of Dan Brown's book, Angels & Demons. The movie will disappoint a lot of book fans, especially the ending. In the book, the ending is the best part, all the truths have been told at the end; the movie clearly missed one of the most important ones(I better just stop here and let you guys find it out in the book by yourselves). Compare to the DaVinci Code, I liked The DaVinci Code better, I love movies that are associated with solving mysteries from the past history, which is why I loved the atmosphere of The DaVinci Code. Angels & Demons is more like a pure action movie for me, those deep discussions of the relationship between science and religion are also disappeared in the movie. The movie becomes less meaningful compare to the book; but if you didn't read the book, it would still be a solid thriller to watch. So here, me, as an audience, not a book fan, I give this movie a 7/10.",7,3,6,16 May 2009
The Social Network," There is a 'Like' button for this movie and I will not be surprised if you 'Favorite' this movie.
","There is a 'Like' button for this movie and I will not be surprised if you 'Favorite' this movie. Fascinating storytelling, beautiful cinematography and brilliant performance by Jesse Eisenberg. Aaron Sorkin's screenplay and David Fincher's direction have made this movie incredibly engaging; the moment the movie starts, it simply takes your breath away. Jesse perfectly portrayed a computer genius who's as complicated as those programming source codes, and every gesture he made defines a computer geek. I have a feeling that he's going to receive an Oscar nomination for his performance in this movie. He really deserves it. As for the writer, Aaron Sorkin will easily win an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. Friendship, ambition, desire, envy, betrayal and revenge, you will find yourself so wrong if you think The Social Network is going to be a typical documentary/biography style movie. And there's no words I can describe how much I love David Fincher as a director, perhaps it's time to give him an Oscar. Let's wait and see how The Social Network will dominate this year's award season.",10,0,4,5 October 2010
