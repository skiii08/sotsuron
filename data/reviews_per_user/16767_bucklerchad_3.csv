Walk the Line," Great acting
","I like how in the beginning of the movie Joaquin Phoenix was singing slightly out of key, like he was new to singing (obviously portraying Johnny Cash being new at it as well) and didn't know what he was doing. Throughout the movie he progressed and got better and better.Really great acting, you can tell everyone really got into their parts and did an excellent job portraying the real people. A really down to earth movie, which in real life, I hear Cash and Carter were both down to earth as well.They really went in depth with how Cash struggled with drug addiction and his desire and longing for June. Great movie !",9,0,0,2 May 2006
Jarhead," Brilliant production
","I loved it, I thought it was brilliant. Awesome acting. The actors did great with showing what war stress, being around other people in close quarters for too long and stress from boredom can do to someone.I've heard others ask what the point of this film was. Well, what I got from it was one man's story of bonding with war mates, the loss war produces in other's lives (like relationships and cheating spouses) and just the overall way the military affects and changes one's psyche.I actually laughed quite a bit as well. There were some really funny parts to it. Jake Gyllenhaal did a wonderful job, Foxx was great as always, but the award should go to Peter Sarsgaard. Wow.Great acting once again. I thought it was just an awesome movie.",8,1,2,10 November 2005
War of the Worlds," Very intense the whole time.
","This movie was very intense and sometimes downright scary. The realism and possibility of this actually happening alone is enough to make it viewable.Cruise and the rest of the crew are as good as you can get when it comes to casting. And what a better actor to get than Tom Cruise, a person who follows a 'religion' that believes we were attacked by aliens millions of years ago. The storyline again is realistic and very possible if there are actual aliens.I was on the edge of my seat the whole time and downright close to anxiety attacks because of the way Spielberg brings you up and down, up and down. Genius, pure genius.Believe it or not, it was quite humorous and got a lot of laughter from the audience and myself. Some parts were just breathtaking visually. Of course it had top notch graphics, and the sound effects were bar none the best I've heard in a theater.It was so loud and 'in your face' at times, the speakers in the theater were actually popping and crackling. The system was just on the edge of handling these sound effects.Enough rambling, go see this and as always, don't get too hyped up. I've found that believing the hype always gives you a let down. So just keep an open mind and go into it like a 5 year old. Spielberg is a genius, know this !!",9,1,6,29 June 2005
