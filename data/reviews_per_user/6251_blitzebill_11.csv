Scarface," horrible remake by a horrible director
","i'll keep it short...de palma's remake of a classic film was a huge mistake and a worthless film.paul muni the original scarface is rolling in his grave and yet smiling because he knows his performance was a real one.i love pacino, but he should have never done this mess. and that's exactly what it is...a mess!those of you who think this a great film are most likely those who have no regard for anything but gratuitous violence and extreme over the top antics.stone as usual in his obsessive and neurotic manner took a story and smeared it with his demented mind.",4,6,12,12 August 2006
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," sappy? corny? brilliant?
","for those of you who post here and disparage ET, you must be from outer space. you are not part of the human race.this film may have its moments when you feel manipulated to the extreme, but that's what film is all about. get over it.the writing is brilliant (courtesy of Harrison Ford's ex-wife).the acting is great.the direction is, well, if it's Spielberg (I've had people say I resemble him, (aww shucks)), it's usually quite good.name me one director who hasn't made a stinker once in his/her career.besides, Dee Wallace is hot in this film. oofah!",9,0,0,5 July 2008
Star Trek," great look at the possible 'beginnings' of our friends Kirk, Spock, et al...
","oh brother...the negative comments here about the new Trek are awful.these people have mostly missed the point, and the great film they sat in front of.seems to me some people reviewing here are missing an essential point...this may be a re- boot, but this is also a story about 'beginnings.'we get to see Kirk grow up and become what we remember him as from the series in the 1960s. we see how he meets Spock and see the other great characters we remember from the 60s series come into play.This is fascinating and helps us to see characters develop (if the writers and director did their job correctly) from their youth.in that sense, it is not unlike the Stars Wars episodes that take us back to the beginning and fill in the gaps up to George Lucas' predilection to start the story in the middle.many people are whining about how this new Trek just erased all the wonderful moments and memories of the 60s series. baloney! you people need to get a life.if anything, this new Trek film makes you want to go back and rewatch the while TV series...it makes an important connection to it!remember it's just a movie! not the end of the world!",9,3,12,8 May 2009
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," one of the best ever
","boy i tell ya, the so-called film critics on this site are amazing. they have such stringent requirements to give a film 10 out of 10!Butch and Sundance is one of the very best films ever made, probably the best work George Roy Hill ever did.Newman and Redford quickly show why they were such a hit together and continued that in The Sting. Bear in mind that Steve McQueen was slated for Redford's part, but because Zanuck refused his demand to get top billing, he left. Zanuck also wanted Brando and/or Warren Beatty involved, but Hill and Newman said no.Lucky for us!But the average rating for this film on IMDb is a mere 8.1 out of 10. Youse guys is tough! Glad I'm not a film director!",10,0,2,11 July 2006
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Rex is king
","T. Rex and family are the best actors in this disastrous and unfortunate sequel.Spielberg made a very bad decision in making this movie.There is not one character you feel sorry for or hope that they survive. except the dinosaurs.if this film demonstrates anything, it is that the human species is as dumb as it looks.what struck me more than once was the way several characters acted and responded like Nedry from the original Jurassic park. they were all stupid and self-serving.the special effects of course we spectacular.but that wasn't enough to save this movie.EVERYONE in this movie was irritating, and i had no sympathy for them.at the end of the movie the real 'lost world' is revealed: modern civilization.",5,2,5,13 February 2009
The Hangover Part II," piece of crap
","yet another 'comedy' that has absolutely no relationship with the comedic form.this is not a film or a movie. at best it can be classified as a flick.the level of humor and comedy in this 'civilized' culture we call the human race of the 21st century is far removed from what was once a form of popular cultural expression, that at least was funny.you could see comedy changing back in the 90s with worthless junk like 'There's Something About Mary.' The only film I ever walked out on, until this one.Hangover II was a mistake from the beginning.I dread the future.",1,14,30,30 May 2011
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," predictable and...lame
","giving this film a 2 out of 10 is generous.this is predictable Hollywood junk. a lame story.why would they even think to try to kill each other without perhaps figuring out that they weren't after each other, but some other lame idiot.the acting is lame as well.the only obvious outcome is that Pitt and Jolie abandoned their respective spouses in real life to get together and become Hollywood's new 'golden couple.'lame.",2,1,3,23 September 2006
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," brilliant
","It took me 4 years but I finally got to see this tonight.It was what I expected: a subtle-not-so-subtle satire and poke at Hollywood, Broadway, celebrity, acting, fantasy, fame and reality.Many who have negatively reviewed this film have completely missed the point. Their loss.Deserved the Oscars it received.And the drum score was awesome! The Academy was totally off-base with its decision to deny it a nomination.",10,2,3,27 May 2018
Vanilla Sky," needs a facelift
","As usual, Hollywood sees $$ in a good foreign film and tries to take advantage of it by making ITS version of what it thinks the story is about, or how an American audience will respond to it.it happens all the time, and Vanilla Sky is a perfect example.Abre los ojos, the original film, is superior in every way.It must be horrible for a movie industry to have so much jealousy over what European filmmakers can do, that is so much better.but Hollywood will never learn.Just look at the crap it puts out now.Don't waste your time on Vanilla Sky.It needs major reconstruction.",2,1,3,6 February 2009
Mr. Holland's Opus," a movie about music, not music theory
","the naysayers and music snobs that visit this site and make noise about Mr. Holland have their heads up their (proverbial) butts.i'm a professional musician. i've seen the movie. you're missing the bigger picture here...the movie is about art and the way it touches everyone who comes in contact with it.it's about whatever we can appreciate in music and every fine art, and use it to make our lives a bit better.it's not about accuracy of who wrote what and what music theory principle was illustrated incorrectly in the film.get a clue people! oh that's right...you're clueLESS.",8,3,5,11 August 2006
Bull Durham," dudes!
","lighten up already! movies can be fun! this movie is fun.i'm sick of people trying to make every celluloid creationan excuse for social commentary.in this movie...you don't have to think about politics...or poverty...or perversity...well.er..uh..there's some in here, but it's fun too! or war...or social injustice...it's all about fun dudes! geez, does every movie have to have some serious, profound earth-shattering message? NO!",8,4,8,27 July 2008
