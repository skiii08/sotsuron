The Longest Yard," Falls Short and Falls Flat
","This was a mess from the get-go. Do yourself a favor,and when you do compare the two. First off,go by the nearest video store and rent the original version of Robert Aldrich's 1974 version of 'The Longest Yard' and you'll know what the definition of 'dumbing down' really means. What the producers did here was take the concepts of the original movie and they not only killed it,they butchered it. Totally. Just recently,Paramount Pictures has been doing this to a LOT of there classic movies and turning them into remakes that are totally bogus to why were they got to be remade in the first place. A prime example of this chaos was Micheal Caine's 1966 version of 'Alfie',where as in the new version,the remake was played by Jude Law and the results were a disaster waiting to happen. This isn't the first time Paramount has done this to there classic movies,but instead of going by the original format,the producers did here was rehash the original storyline but updated it to present a new and bogus effect. You see a lot of this in soon-to-be-released upcoming movies between now and Christmas.And now to 'The Longest Yard',the 2005 version. This is a version or to say an update on the classic film that starred Burt Reynolds,whom from this film cemented his status as one of the biggest superstars of the 1970's. In the new version,Burt Reynolds is totally wasted as if he were going to asked the question...What in the hell and I am doing here in the first place? Also,in the starring role is Adam Sandler,who is totally miscast and miswasted(the village idiot)as Paul Crewe,and who knew that Sandler can played football is anybody guess. The rest of the cast consist of former NFL players,Wrestlers from the WWE and WWF,Sportscast announcers,and Hip-Hop superstar moguls who THINK they can act. And again,who told Chris Rock that he can act? Lets face it, Chris Rock can't act,period. He is the sidekick,the jester and above all else the guy who always gets his somewhere down the line. The only saving grace here is the villain roles especially by James Cromwell and William Fichtner respectively.The analysis? When the original 'The Longest Yard' came out in 1974,this was a serious movie with some very hilarious moments,and not to mention some serious acting from Burt Reynolds,Eddie Albert and Ed Lauter,who were in the prime of there careers,especially Reynolds who became a megastar overnight because of this movie. In the 2005 version,you get a movie that is between or veer between silliness and stupidity,and excessive and lurid violence. This was suppose to be thrown in for good measure but in all aspects that is a joke between the contests of supermacy between the Inmates and the Guards and win one for the gipper is way beyond the point of this movie. And with nothing but comments and humor about fat guy jokes,gay bashing jokes(check out the scene with SNL regular Tracy Morgan),redneck jokes,jokes about black people and the ghetto,and other lame lines along with some intense racist comments many of them are repeated twice. And from there its not funny. Moments were the hip-hop soundtrack and occasional burst of the music from the 1960's and 1970's are for the older crowd. In all it just falls flat. The worst of 2005.",Null,6,11,28 August 2005
Casablanca," Casablanca: As Time Goes By,It Is Still Timeless....A classic from the golden-age of Hollywood
","For more than 60 years later,movie fans are still falling on love with the greatest American romance film ever made. It was this movie by the way that cemented Humphrey Bogart's fame as a maverick Hollywood icon and in the history of motion pictures itself.'Casablanca': Is there any other movie more Americans can agree on? In one perspective,you'll always find dissenters with 'Citizen Kane', 'Gone With The Wind','The Wizard Of Oz',and even other films like 'It's A Wonderful Life','The Best Years Of Our Lives',not to mention two other Humphrey Bogart classics like 'Key Largo',and also 'The African Queen',not to mention the other Hollywood epics of their day. Somehow for those who have never seen 'Casablanca',or those who have never heard of Humphrey Bogart or for that manner his co-star Ingrid Bergman,not only love the movie,but love it more as--what's the phrase--as time goes by. Do not experience this movie on either Video or for that manner DVD or for other reasons do not see this on television either. The best way to experience this Humphrey Bogart masterpiece is on a projected screen in a movie house with a capacity audience. It was meant to be seen on the big screen. It sometimes plays in selected art-houses where it shown as a part of a midnight screenings,or as part of selected screenings at some prestigious colleges and universities.'Casablanca',was one of the top grossing films of 1942,and was the winner of three academy awards including Best Picture,Best Director and Best Screenplay,and it is Number 2,after Orson Welles''Citizen Kane',on the American Film Institute's list of the greatest movies of all time. 'Casablanca' has achieved an iconic status way out of proportions to its celluloid scale:a wartime melodrama(that takes place in the Middle East,since this movie was released at the height of World War II),at a running time of 102 minutes long,and was made for less than one million dollars on a essentially one set.Those famous lines!('Here's looking at you,kid.') Those stars! (Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman at their most magnificent and their most magnetic.)That style!(Trench coats on a airfield tarmac.) That song! Will always go down in music history('You must remember this,a kiss is still a kiss,a sigh is just a sigh..........' Basically,you know the rest of it.It was a perfect product of the Hollywood factory at its golden peak during the early 1940's and in the midst of World War II. A film that was brilliantly cast,with skill and dignity and it shows in some of the most memorable of all characters. This was a film that came from the golden-age of the talent pool from the studios of Warner Bors. Pictures. This was when Warner Bors. was a pioneering force in Hollywood and a major perennial powerhouse. 'Casablanca' is not only the best film to come out of a major Hollywood studio,but also to point out it is a work of art and sheer genius. A melodrama-adventure spectacle that is flawlessly directed(by Michael Curtiz),subtly played,and excellent performances throughout. It is a cinematic classic to behold. See it sometime at a nearby theater. Do not catch this film on neither video or playing on television. Experience it at the movies.",Null,0,1,21 September 2006
MASH," M*A*S*H-the theatrical version
","The long-running television series is so deeply imbedded in the public imagination that the true nature of Robert Altman's anarchic film has been largely forgotten. Younger viewers who have not seen it and expect a longer version of the sitcom are going to be shocked,because in these more politically sensitive times,'M*A*S*H' could not be made. Think about it. What studio executive would give the green light to a film with a black character named 'Spearchucker',a priest named 'Dago Red',and a dentist who attempts suicide because he thinks that he's becoming 'a fairy'? Seen with some historical context,Altman's scathing anti-establishment comedy is far from perfect,but the best moments are riotously funny(for all the wrong reasons)and the film expresses the rebellious mood of America in 1970 with absolute accuracy. It manages to do that without ever commenting directly on the war. Though the setting is 1950's Korea,it really 1970's Vietnam. The only time Altman and writer Ring Lardner come close to making an overt political statement is in their funniest one liner. When by-the-book Major Margaret Houlihan(Sally Kellerman)says of Dr.Hawkeye Pierce(Donald Sutherland),'I wonder how a degenerated person like that could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps?' 'He was drafted,' is the deadpan answer. In 1970,the line had audiences howling with laughter.War itself is really not a subject. The only gunshot in the film is used to end the climactic football game. The nameless broken bodies that are flown into the hospital are the only evidence of the conflict. Altman shows war's destructiveness in those graphic wounds and bloody operating rooms. Those moments had never been presented so realistically on screen. Audiences who went to see this film in 1970 were horrified,and so any further comment would have been irrelevant. Altman's real targets are closer to home-organized religion and the military,both seen by the filmmakers as close minded institutions,inimical to genuine human values. They're personified in the characters of Maj. Houlihan and Maj. Frank Burns(Robert Duvall),both far removed from their TV incarnations(the television characters were portrayed by Loretta Swit and Larry Linville).As interpreted by Duvall,Burns is a more serious and sinister figure. He is such a forceful character that he would upset the shaky comic balance of the film if he didn't make such an early exit. 'Hotlips' Houlihan is more troubling. She is transformed presumably by the embarrassment of the shower scene,from a competent if narrow minded nurse into a brainless cheerleader. The change may be due to over-enthusiasm improvisation on Sally Kellerman's part during the football sequence. The protagonists are stronger characters,too. In the operating room,they're accomplished professionals. Outside,they're lecherous sophomoric pranksters with a wide mean streak. Altman's direction is completely true with the doctors' knockabout attitude. He uses filters to give a rougher texture to the already rough surfaces of the M*A*S*H unit;long lenses allow him to keep the camera at a distance to encourage ensemble improvisation;dialogue from one scene extended to the next;semi linear narrative.And within that often chaotic structure,the big scenes are masterful-the unforgettable microphone under the bed,the extended 'suicide' sequence,complete with the Last Supper tableau,the use of the public address system as a cracked Greek chorus,even the nonsensical football game. If,in hindsight,M*A*S*H seems harsher than it once did,but in all aspects it is still funny and original,and it anger is not misplaced.",Null,0,0,5 September 2009
Malcolm X," A film that stands the test of time.....
","This was a stirring tribute of a film that to this day still stands the test of time even after its release more than a decade ago. This was in fact a autobiography and educational film which some of the most electrifying performance ever displayed on film,and it is the reason to see why. This was Denzel Washington's finest piece of work and most notably the best of his career in which he should have been nominated for Best Actor Oscar category,instead of his work which he won the Best Actor statue for 2001's 'Training Day'. Anyway,'Malcolm X',was a brilliant tribute to the controversial black activist,a leader in the struggle for black liberation as well as black pride and one of the most outspoken individuals who had a different side of the civil rights movement where a time when America was at war with itself.Based on the best-selling autobiography by Malcolm X and Alex Haley,and with spellbinding direction by Spike Lee,it traces the story of Malcolm himself,from his days as a hustler and drug runner and hitting rock bottom during his imprisonment in the 1950's,he became a Black Muslim and then a leader in the Nation Of Islam under the guidance of the honorable Elijah Muhammad. His assassination in 1965 left a legacy of black nationalism,self-determination and racial pride that continues to the day and within a new generation whom for the first time has witnessed a masterpiece of cimematic work. This is marked by strong performances throughout with powerful direction by Spike Lee,cimematopgrapher Ernest Dickerson,and riveting breathtaking performances by Denzel Washington,Angela Bassett,and most notably from Al Freeman,Jr. as Elijah Muhammad. The real centerpiece of the film is from Denzel Washington himself,whose convincing performance in the title role brings this film alive. When this film came out,it only receive one Oscar nomination but however,the film garnered a lot of  awards including the NAACP Image Film Award,The New York Film Critics Award for Best Actor,The Los Angeles Times Film Award for Best Director and Best Actor,and MTV Movie Awards for both Denzel Washington and Al Freeman,Jr.--all of this happened in 1992,when the film came out.As far as the cameos go,this film had a lot of them in one picture including Black Panther Bobby Seale,Reverend Al Sharpton,The Honorable Nelson Mandela,Reverend Jesse Jackson,along with Hollywood walk-ons: Christopher Plummer,Karen Allen,Peter Boyle and Danny Glover,and Whoopi Goldberg.Brilliant!-Five Stars",Null,56,77,23 April 2004
Forrest Gump," Commerating the 10th Anniversary of an American classic
","Wow,it has been ten years ago........By the time 'Forrest Gump' swept most of the major 1994 Academy Awards,it had already become the third-highest grossing film of all time,as well as a genuine pop phenomenon embracing best selling books,gnomic catch phrases,and reams of commentary on the editorial pages of magazines and newspapers throughout the world. It has already broken box office records worldwide and stands behind great cinema classics like 'Raiders Of The Lost Ark','E.T.','Titanic','The Lion King',and so many more. Even through its distribution of its market through DVD and video,it has grossed even more domestic wealth and still holds that mark as of today,even after its release more than ten years ago. Clearly,a great event,FORREST GUMP,is a great film and a great piece of cinematic magic within itself. It has the form of an epic that goes within the boundaries of depth and resonance;the trappings of satire without a coherent attitude,and the semblance of historical revisionism without a critical sensibility. To paraphrase the screenplay,FORREST GUMP,may not be a smart film,but it knows what love is-its dim-witted protagonist,as expertly portrayed by Tom Hanks,has captured the love of millions,which by the way made Tom Hanks,the Jimmy Stewart of our generation. Despite its limitations,FORREST GUMP has charm to spare,thanks to an enduring central performance by Tom Hanks,as well as a series of irresistibly playful historical tableau's achieved with unprecedented verisimilitude by the computer-savvy artists at George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic. Although fictional protagonists have been made to interact with historical figures in CITIZEN KANE and ZELIG,FORREST GUMP represents a technological breakthrough. Unfortunably it is also far less thoughtful than these illustrious processors,and at times seems nearly as simple minded as its protagonist. While FORREST GUMP stands out as a break taking cinematic masterpiece,it is a remarkably brilliant one through various scenes as it follows the character through three decades of turmoil which begins with his upbringing in rural Greenbow,Alabama through various events that featuring computerized images of Governor George Wallace,President Kennedy at the White House,and his meeting with President Johnson as Forrest receives the Medal Of Honor for bravery during his turmoil in Vietnam and that continues throughout as he joins a ping-pong team that takes a tour of China and his meeting with President Nixon,and accidentally uncovers the Watergate break-in of the 1970's. However,its vision of the Vietnam War,for example,is constructed not from historical memory,but by means of a deft deployment of clichÃ©s drawn from the most prominent movies that display the Vietnam War in general(examples from such films as Apocalypse Now,The Deer Hunter,Coming Home,Platoon,and Born On The Fourth Of July).Indeed,director Robert Zemeckis's period recreations depend more on the music of that period than any other visual sense of time and place:once the wall to wall soundtrack of the period kicks in which contains hits from various groups from the 1960's and early 1970's. The characters here are very well supportive with outstanding performances from actresses Sally Field,and Robin Wright-Penn to actor Gary Sinise's portrayal of Lt. Dan,who does a fair impression of Willem Dafoe from two Oliver Stone films;PLATOON(with legs)and BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY (without as a paraplegic)to a supportive acting from Mykelti Williamson as Forrest's best friend Bubba. Although Winston Groom's original novel contains some astringent satire,the film's version settles for gentle jabs at racism and the military. Unusually vague it is attitude towards the events and its depicts,FORREST GUMP went on the sweep the Oscars for Best Picture,Best Director(Robert Zemeckis),Best Actor(Tom Hanks), Best Adapted Screenplay(Eric Roth),and Best Supportive Actor(Gary Sinise),and still went on the become one of the biggest moneymaking films of 1994.Even after ten years,it is still embraced by several national figures as a celebration of traditional values and a condemnation of the 1960's counterculture. In many ways,the film still represents old-fashioned Hollywood liberalism where racists are wrong,war is hell,assassinations are bad,and it's good to be nice--even if the world is different from various places. Still,the films a lot of heart and a lot of guts and brains to make it possible. Congradulations on your 10th Anniversary-- FORREST GUMP.",Null,1,3,29 July 2004
Gone with the Wind," The Epic Of All Epics-The Brilliant Gone With The Wind
","Producer David O. Selznick wanted 'Gone With The Wind' to be somehow more than a movie,a film that would broaden the very idea of what a film could do and look like. In many respects he got what he worked so hard to achieve in this grand 1939 magnificent spectacule which went on the become to all-time box office champ in terms of tickets sold,and in some far beyond the goal that it have went onward to achieve. The results were astounding. The movie went on to received a boatload full of Oscars--ten Oscars in all,including Best Picture of 1939. The primary results were historical as well,and a first in motion pictures. Actress Hattie McDaniel,became the first African-American in the history of the American cinema to received the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress,a feat that went beyond expectations and open doors for other astounding black actors later on. The film itself is a cinematic classic,and it still is the top attraction to see,even if those individuals who have never seen this movie before,it is worth seeing,especially in a movie theatre projected onto a huge screen in front of a capacity audience. Any with good reason. It is no wonder that 'Gone With The Wind' became MGM's biggest and most fiscally successful film not only in the history of motion pictures,but within the studio itself,making MGM a perennial powerhouse in Hollywood. In all,cinematic achievement which is right up there with two other MGM hits as well...The Charlton Heston spectacle of 1959's 'Ben-Hur',and also the 1968 science-fiction masterpiece of Stanley Kubrick's '2001'.Getting back to 'Gone With The Wind',based on the Margaret Mitchell's grand scale novel,the story is based on the tale of the Old South and the coming of the Civil War. While the first half of the Civil War is taut and suspenseful as well as nostalgic,the second half is ramshackle and arbitrary. But there is no question that the film is an emormous achievement is terms of its every resource--art director,color,sound,cimematopgraphy-being pushed to new limits for the greater glory of telling an American story as fully as possible. Vivian Leigh's character of Scarlett O'Hara is one of the most magnificently narcissistic performances in the history of the cinema. Her performance here stands out. Olivia de Havilland's character as the angelic and lovely as Melanie Hamliton,and Leslie Howard's reckless and aristocratic Ashley Wilkes are one of the key elements that make the film come full circle. But the main reason and the performance that will stand out is Clark Gable's character of Rhett Butler. He gives one of the most vital,masculine,commanding performances ever committed to film. His one-liner ensemble is one of the greatest in screen history.'Frankly my dear,I don't give a damn.' Produced by Selznick Productions and MGM-Running Time of 222 minutes which was restored for the re-release in 1999(for its golden 50th anniversary and later in the extended DVD version in its original run of 238 minutes). MGM has re-released this film numerous times between its release from 1939 and today(which is shown in selected theatres restored to its original Technicolor glory and re-mastered from its original 70MM print) for all audiences to enjoy.",Null,0,0,18 August 2006
Schindler's List," The masterpiece of 1993....Schindler's List
","Any filmmaker who chooses to deal with the Holocaust faces several serious problems. The first is deciding which story to tell. Conventional heroics are impossible;a realistic look at the horror is too appalling. In Thomas Keneally's fact-based novel,Steven Spielburg found the right balance of redemption and sorrow. Oskar Schindler(Liam Neeson) is an ambitious businessman who realizes that there is money to be made in war. In a masterful opening montage,Spielburg mixed the forced transfer of Polish Jews to cities after the Nazi occupation with Schindler making his own moves. As families register with bureaucrats who sit at folding tables and make their tidy lists,Schindler matches suits and ties,selects the right cufflinks,and pockets a hefty bankroll. The Jews are forced into their ghetto;Schindler goes to a nightclub where he wines and dines high-ranked Nazis. The two worlds come together when Schindler meets Itzhak Stern(Ben Kingsley)and offers him a deal. Since Jews cannot own businesses,they should work together. Stern's contacts can provide financial banking. Stern himself can provide the expertise to run a business. Schindler will bring 'panache.' 'That's what I'm good at,' he says. 'Not to work...the presentation.'It may not be a fair deal,but once Schindler signs contracts to provide the Wehrnmacht with cooking utensils,he is able to open an enamelware factory that provides several hundred Jews with jobs. Those jobs,the documentation that goes with them,give the men and women a measure of safety as the Nazis' plans for the 'final solution' grind inexorably forward to the March 13,1943 liquidation of the Krakow ghetto. That is one of the most harrowing series of scenes ever put on film,and it is matched by the concentration camp sequences that follow. In those scenes of mass chaos and slaughter,Spielburg uses a single spot of color to highlight one little girl. In the black-and-white world,her coat is red. It's almost the same shade as the jacket worn by the young protagonist of Spielburg's Empire of the Sun(1987),in a similar situation when he's alone in a mob and trying to find his way home.In those same scenes,Amon Goeth(Ralph Finnes)is introduced. Goeth is a flabby sociopath who comes to embody the evils of Nazi racism. He is in charge of the camp where the workers are housed and so must be brided and pampered if Schindler is to stay in business. Goeth's excessive cruelty is also part of the reason that Schindler is transformed from war profiteer to crusader. The exact moment of that change is not shown,and it should not be shown. Though popular films are built around such epiphanies,that scene would be out of place in this careful film. Instead,its an accretion of layered awareness that makes Schindler what he becomes. Though Goeth is a selfish,undisciplined man who drinks too much and sleeps with too many women,he is moved by the mounting barbarism,cruelty,and savagery that surrounds him. Neeson's performance is built on a combination of self-confidence,indecision,and doubt. Though some have criticize Steven Zaillian's script on the grounds that it makes Schindler more altruistic than he really was,it does stick closely to historical fact in the numbers of people that Schindler saved from the Holocaust. In the same way,the real Goeth was even more monstrous than he is in the film. But the full scope of his atrocities had been shown,the film would have been unbalanced. As it is,Spielburg pushes the limit,showing as much of the horror as the screen will bear. That horror is alleviated,slightly by Janusz Kaminski's stunning black-and-white cinematography. It gives the violence an abstract,dreamlike quality that no form of color could have matched. He won an Academy Award for his work,and the American Society of Cinematopgraphers placed the film at number five on its best-shot(1950-1997)list. John Williams's somber,almost unoticed score adds the melancholy tone. 'Schindler's List',also was the overall winner at the Academy Awards. Winning seven Oscars including Best Picture of 1993,as well as Best Director and for Steven Spielburg.Any viewer might be able to find shortcomings somewhere in the collaborative effort,but to what point? Schindler's List demonstrates the potential of Hollywood film-making that is so rarely achieved. When the full financial resources of the industry and best creative people are put in service of an important story,the results can be staggering.",Null,9,13,19 June 2009
2001: A Space Odyssey," The 40th Anniversary of a Stanley Kubrick masterpiece. A landmark achievement in the science fiction genre
","When '2001' was released in 1968 it was breathtaking excitement. But this was a film that you watch in order to be entertained or amused. Instead it provides you with a banquet of food for thought,images that linger in the mild's eye long after the movie itself is over and it is a film that you could mediate on. At a running time of 151 minutes with about 2 and half hour of film with 45 minutes of dialogue. There are still two schools of thought until this very day. First one will agree that it is one of the greatest science fiction films ever made,a technical achievement unheard of when it was released in 1968. Second,one may agree that it is also one of the most horrifically boring and confusing movies ever made. The story(based on Arthur C. Clarke's novel of the same title,who wrote the screenplay)while,seemingly simple,is profound. Sequentially,several mysterious black monoliths are discovered and basically trigger certain events integral to the film. What are they? Where did they come from? What do they do? These are all questions one asks oneself while watching the story develop and is asked to find his own way. While most come away with a general idea of what took place in the story each individual will have to decide what it means to them. Any way one decides to answer these questions results in profound solutions. Its not left entirely up to interpretation,but in some aspects it is. Experience it for more clarification. The end result is quite chilling,no matter what your personal solution. '2001: A Space Odyssey' was not a regular motion picture with a complex plot,extensive dialogue,numerous characters,but rather,a story told in a series of carefully crafted pictures,which serve the purpose of not only amazing us through the breathtaking visual effects,but also of provoking our thought and imagination.Rather than telling us about it or explaining it to us Kubrick has decided to allow the audience to experience for itself thus unforgettable epic journey. The music of '2001' is as essential as any of the other elements in creating the atmosphere of the film,from the hallmark opening theme to Strauss' 'Blue Danube'. Although the first 2 hours of the film are,undoubtedly,visually stunning and rich in its metaphors. It is the last 20 minutes of '2001' that truly amaze and boggles the mind. From the cold,creepy shots showing Jupiter and its satellites(accompanied by the spine-chilling music),to the flabbergasting journey through the infinite,and finally,to the famous ambigous ending,Kubrick is provoking us to see the big picture:the fact that we have not even begun to understand the vastness of the universe and,even more than that,the infinite nature of our existence. Kubrick was a genius when he made this masterpiece,since this movie is to be experienced more than understood,and it is one of the few films that has stood the test of time,some 40 years after its release.What makes it work so well? The sheer scope and mastery of it all. This is film in its purest form and one of the most multi-layered motion picture ever made. It is one of the few films that can be incredibly artistic and succeed in being so without coming across as pretentious or inaccessible,unlike many other 'classics'. Most of all,it is a film of unparallel visual beauty. Its obvious Kubrick spend three years in the making and production on the look of this film,and he pulled off everything he set out to do. Its a feast for the eyes that only improves with each viewing. However,if you have a true appreciation for the fine art of cinema and its potential to illuminate and inspire,then you will certainly find that '2001' is one of the most important and profound works on film ever produced. Experience this with a food of thought. Have an open mind when you see this masterpiece of science fiction brilliance. '2001' stirs the emotions and penetrates the subconscious of the viewer and its astounding from beginning to end. The way to experience this movie is not on any DVD,but to see it in its entirely in the cinema on a widescreen in full 70MM and super Dobly Stereophonic sound.",Null,0,4,18 December 2008
Pulp Fiction," A cinematic Masterpiece Commerating on its Tenth Anniversary
","Contains SpoilersThe Tenth Anniversary of a cinematic Classic!!!Released in 1994 with its witty,stylish and romantic to its dark heart,PULP FICTION is a compulsively funny and strangely dreamy look at the criminals,hangers-on,and low life scum who populate a glamorously sleazy Los Angeles of the mind. The movie's opening scene is in a diner,where none-too bright criminal lovebirds Honey Bunny(Amanda Plummer)and Pumpkin(Tim Roth)discuss their future. They're tired of holding up liquor stores and 7/11's:too many shopkeepers with too many guns They decide to switch to diners,in broad daylight,which are full of people with wallets and purses. The pre-credits sequence ends as Honey Bunny leaps up,gun in hand,and shouts that it's a stick-up. The next sequence begins in a car,as hit men Jules(Samuel Jackson)and Vincent Vega(John Travolta),who's just returned from an extended stay in Europe,talks about everything under the sun-at least,and everything that interests them,from what a Quarter Pounder is called in France to TV Pilots. They're on their way to pay a visit to three clean-cut,middle class youths who've make the mistake of double crossing their boss,Marsellus. Jules is especially interested in the fact that Vincent has been assigned to escort Marsellus' wife Mia while the big man is out of town;there are pitfalls inherent in spending time with the boss's wife. Their visit with the college boys takes a nasty turn for the worst after they briefcase-which emits a strange,radiant light-that Marsellus has sent them to retrieve. This is where Jackson quotes a part from the Bible(and it is one of the best performances throughout the film)before the entourage of taking out the youths.We see next Vincent on his way to keep his date with Mia(Uma Thurman). He stops off to visit his dealer,Lance(Eric Stoltz),buys some heroin,and shoots up before arriving at Marsellus' home. Vincent and Mia have dinner at Jackrabbit Slim's,a 1950s theme restaurant,then Vincent takes her home. While he is in the bathroom,she discovers the heroin in his pocket,mistakes it for cocaine and snorts some. When he comes out,she's comatose:in a panic,he takes her to Lance's where they administer a shot of adrenaline to the heart. She recovers,and the evening ends with Mia and Vincent promising that the events will be their secret. In the next sequence,we meet Butch(Bruce Willis),a washed up boxer who is being paid for by Marsellus(Ving Rhames) to takes a dive in a upcoming fight,but Butch has other plans--who then flees with his girlfriend Fabianne(Maria de Medeirous) and get out of the country. The next morning he learns that Fabianne has forgotten the watch he inherited from his father who fought in the war(Christopher Walken),and goes back to the apartment to retrieve it,but instead finds the watch,and then driving back to his girlfriend,Butch runs down Marsellus,who tries to kill him,and from there Marsellus chases Butch into a pawnshop when turns out to be sadistic hillbilly sex murderers which Butch escapes while they're assaulting Marsellus,but his sense of honor makes him goes back and kills the sadistic suckers in a bloody outburst of gore,and from there Marsellus forgives him but tells Butch to leave town and he and his girlfriend ride off into the sunset.The final sequence returns to Jules and Vincent's dilemma where they killed off the young victims,but a fourth one lives. In the car Jules claims that they were saved by a miracle,but while they're driving and talking,Vincent accidentally shoots the passenger,and they find somewhere to hide out while they clean up there gore-splattered car full of bone fragments. They descend on Jimmy(Quentin Tarantino),a close friend of Jules,but they have to be out before Jimmy's wife returns. However,Marsellus sends The Wolf(Harvey Keitel)to get them out of their situation and from after their taxing morning,Jules and Vincent decide to have breakfast in the same diner that Honey Bunny and Pumpkin and about to rob. As customers hit the floor,Jules remains calm while Vincent is in the diner's restroom. He refuses to give up the briefcase,overpowers Pumpkin,talks Honey Bunny out of opening fire,and eventually defuses the whole situation. At the end,Vincent and Jules leave the diner,still talking about Jules' plans to devote himself over to God.On the commemoration of its tenth anniversary,PULP FICTION is a witty,violent and unexpectedly redemptive tour de force,in which he juggles three overlapping stories of love,betrayal,and murder as business-as-usual.

Ben-Hur," William Wyler's 'Ben-Hur'-A Cinematic Standard
","Had 'Ben-Hur' never been made, Mel Gibson's 'Braveheart' wouldn't have been nearly as brave,and Peter Jackson's 'The Lord Of The Rings' trilogy wouldn't have been half as lordly. Both cinematic spectacles drew heavily from 'Ben-Hur',a story of catastrophic defeat,steadfast inspiration,tremendous action and overwhelming faith. The epic that all but invented and continues to define the swords-and-sandals genre,'Ben-Hur' is a tale of scummy politics,atrophied friendship and brutal,unjustified punishment. Ultimately,as nearly all great films are, 'Ben-Hur' is a story of love. The film moves with an assurance and majesty that is hardly seen in modern movies. It's certainly in no hurry to get started,content to roll out with a deliberate,operatic sweep. The film begins with a 6-minute,30-second orchestral overture(composed by Miklos Rosza)focusing on the Sistine Chapel image of man's hand outstretched toward the touch of God. The introduction works to calm you and allow you to settle in for a grand scale of an epic.At the focus of the story is the rivalry between Hebrew prince Judah Ben-Hur(Charlton Heston)and his childhood friend,Roman politician Messala(Stephen Boyd),drunk with newfound power.Judah refuses to go along with Messala's request to help quell rebellions,and the twisted Messala takes revenge by falsely accusing Judah,his mother and sister of treason and attempted assassination. Judah is stripped of his wealth and prominence,ripped away from the woman he loves-from his servant's daughter,who is promised to another man-and condemned to slavery. The one thing that keeps Judah alive through years of punishment is sheer hatred of Messala. Judah's rise to freedom and renewed power is an inspiring as it is frightening. It becomes clear as the story proceeds that Judah is gradually becoming just like Messala,with whom the conflict reaches fever pitch in a 11-minute chariot race,one of the most brilliant action scenes ever filmed in cinematic history. Director William Wyler carried a flourish-free,straightforward approach throughout a career that began in the silent era and spanned through the 1960's. He was nominated 12 times for the best-director Oscar and won three times for 'Ben-Hur','Mrs. Miniver' and the after World War II epic,'The Best Years Of Our Lives'. For those who made have never heard of Wyler,that's probably because his unique style didn't stand out in the manner of such Hollywood directors as John Ford,Alfred Hitchcock or David Lean. Instead of forcing a signature the material,Wyler has a way of doing things his way. While the luminaries of his period tended to bend scripts toward their own visions,Wyler bought into the story wholeheartedly adapting his own techniques to best serve the film. Wyler plunges through 'Ben-Hur' with a fortuitous assuredness. His most masterful choice is his depiction of Christ,whose story unfolds silently behind the scenes,sometimes intersecting with the trials of Judah. Wyler never shows us his face,but implies the effect Jesus has on others through his interaction with others. We see Christ reflected in reverent reaction shots. Christ comes forth poetically as a character of inspiration and charisma.'Ben-Hur',was MGM's bold desperate move to avoid bankruptcy,and the idea to make the film was seen as audacious at the time since it was a remake of the 1925 silent adaption of the Lew Wallace novel. Several actors passed on the lead role,including Rock Hudson and Burt Lancaster. Wyler,who started his career as an assistant director on the 1925 version was a natural choice to helm the $15 million production,colossal for its day. Filmed in 'MGM Camera 65'(Super Panavision 70),and magnificent Technicolor. Filming 'Ben-Hur',with lavish sets,sprawling cast and excruciatingly difficult special effects must have taken a dogged resolved that matched that of Judah. The results became one of the highest grossing pictures of that year,when it was released in 1959. The risk paid off well in a total of 11 Oscars,including Best Picture,director,actor(Charlton Heston),and supporting actor(Hugh Griffith),as well as the windfall of a $70 million domestic box office return. The motion picture 'Ben-Hur' is tied with James Cameron's 1997 epic 'Titanic',which won 11 including Best Picture,and the final installment of Peter Jackson's Lord Of The Rings Trilogy 'Return Of The King',also got 11 Oscars including Best Picture of 2003. Both movies had match 'Ben-Hur's astounding record with the number of Oscars. It was re-released in theatres numerous times by the studio and became one of the biggest roadshow spectacles attractions of all time. The take,however,is minuscule when compared to what it gave back to filmdom and Hollywood as a whole.",Null,2,5,2 August 2006
