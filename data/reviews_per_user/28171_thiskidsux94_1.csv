Black Swan," An Inspiring Film from a Nightmare.
","Darren Aronofsky really achieved something this time in the form of an exquisite masterpiece, Black Swan. Natalie Portman really does give an outstanding performance.The film's tone is very similar to the dark psychological tones of Roman Polanski's films (e.g. Rosemary's Baby, The Tenant). Portman's performance defines a generation of actresses and gives it her all. The whole psychology of the film is very disturbing. The film is very strange, as to where to fall under, genre-wise. It's considered a drama but in the likes of psychological horror or psychological thriller. The shaky camera-work also distills a terrifying look into Portman's character's psyche. My recommendation is to watch this film under stress, because at the end, all the weight will be lifted off your shoulders and you will be liberated.",10,3,7,1 January 2011
