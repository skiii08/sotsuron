Blade Runner 2049," Rather disappointing
","TBH, I expected more, while at the same time, I knew what to expect... If you catch my drift.Yes, it was a sequel, but it was far too derivative for its own good.And random...And pointless...And directionless...All in all a waste of a premise.The characters were not at all relatable. There was no chemistry and no depth. There was no need to invest in any of the characters or fear for their demise, not because we knew they would survive, but because we just can't bring ourselves to care.None of them were developed in any way whatsoever. Hell, the most consistent and likeable character wasn't even a replicant, it was a hologram...And the second most empathetic, enjoyable character dies within minutes.This in itself speaks volumes about the other characters in this movie.There was no message except some tacky sea level rising inferences, countless PC references and nods to demographics, that never played out...And a storyline drawn to within an inch of its life by its sheer length.Much like the plot of this movie, some things, like a case of genital warts, or chlamydia are frankly embarrassing and should be dealt with in private, severely and promptly.This plot was like Disney purchased it and dictated the plot.",7,1,2,11 July 2019
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," I walked into this with a blank slate.
","I will be honest. As a professional physicist and part-time philosopher, the direction the real world is headed in generally frightens me. So when I switch off, I tend to hide away in science fiction and speculative fiction.That is why I was surprised that I was drawn to this rather mundane and down to Earth story of a newspaper reporter and hacker/activist.I did take exception at the number of foreigners trying to pass themselves off as scandinavians... while actual scandinavians ended up in the background...Living in Japan for most of my life, I have been subjected to downright horrors such as Black Rain, Rising Sun, The Last Samurai and the most disappointing to me, the adaptation of Memoirs of a Geisha...((I lived in the town where Geisha was going to be shot but the then mayor, in a sudden -ironically harakiri like- career truncating move, turned Spielberg down, resulting in a childishly bitter Spielberg hiring a Korean and Chinese cast and throwing away a chance at a decent movie....))So trying to be authentic is something I take seriously and I think they inevitibly failed at bringing about a scandinavian atmosphere.It was basically brits in winter with a few yanks...Anyway, on to the movie...From the outset, the portrayal of the outcast Lisbeth captivated me and since I had only watched one movie with Craig as Bond, I had very little baggage to contend with, taking him as Blomqvist.The pacing was superb and the detailing along the way, impeccable. The music was at times jarring, though that might have been the intention.. I'm not really a soundtrack guy.The core of the film, the protagonists, gain their viewers' attention and sympathy early on in the film, though it is not certain how they will end up meeting.If I have one issue with Lisbeth's portrayal in this movie, it's how quickly she turns from flinching at Blomqvist's mere proximity after having been abused and then raped at the hands of her 'social'worker to, a mere few hours later, getting naked with him and f''king his brains out.Yes, she is supposedly insane, but I feel she more than just likely a superbly highly functioning autist... (I haven't read the books)As someone who has been close to and looked after abuse victims in the past, I found this particular aspect rather... offputting... The brushing off of what was seemingly a lifetime of abuse since childhood (in and out of institutions and state care?)... at the mere presence of our rather dashing and masculine protag. did come across as a bit insensitive.Perhaps if they had developed their characters a bit more and especially, her intense and sudden attraction to Bq, I might have found that particular aspect of the movie more palatable...However, despite that, the whole story was compelling and the characters relatable enough that I found to my surprise, I truly cared about the outcome enough to watch a 155 minute film...Very entertaining and stimulating movie... I look forward to future installments.",9,1,1,6 February 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy," The Feel Good Factor is strong with this one!
","What can I say... I expected very little going in... This was to all intents and purpose a kids movie after all...Blooming' heck was I proven wrong.The team of misfits were wonderful together and got me cheering for them. The humour was first rate with many a beer from the nose moment to be had and the sheer unadulterated feel good factor came without and cheesy, US morality attached... Bonus.A good old fashioned buddy flick with a kickass story attached... Wonderful stuff!",10,1,2,26 February 2018
Deadpool," One star reviews? ROFL.
","Come on, one star? What you did you think going into this? did you not even read a little about the film you were about to watch. This film has, like it's eponymous lead, defied all odds to get where it had to go.A piece de le resistance of humour, violence and good old fashioned storytelling.Best Valentines Day Movie. Ever.",9,2,5,14 February 2018
Kingsman: The Secret Service," As a friend once told me, Manners Maketh Man.
","There are 850+ reviews comparing this to Bond. So I won't.This is an unadulterated feel good film... Put aside the ridiculous premise of a tailorshop gone rogue and starting a world beating organisation. Put aside the new world order storyline and sky- high tech...This is basically a tale of the underdog reinventing himself and coming out on top... And coming out in a style so sublimely absurd that you can't help but shout 'Fuck yeah!' and cheer out loud.And nobody does it better than the Brits with their understated humour and disturbing, twisted ability to turn surreal violence into an art form on the silver screen.This is more akin to a modern take on Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels with its stylised, refined and idealistically filtered view of justice laced with a dry humour so sharp that one could literally be cut in two... or die of thirst.As another reviewer said, 'This has a real chance of becoming iconic.' and I believe she's on to something there.",9,1,3,6 December 2017
