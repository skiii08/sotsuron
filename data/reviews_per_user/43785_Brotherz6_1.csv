Sucker Punch," Hit or Miss, without question
","First of all SPOILER. STOP READING IF YOU Haven't SEEN IT YET/PLAN TO SEE IT.My friends finally conviced me to go watch this movie. I deeply regret waisting $3 whole dollars on this movie, the things I could of done with 2 hours... not to mention I made an account just to review this movie. (Military base if you were wondering how I piad $3 to see the movie) Anyways, where to start? I think I'd be better off rating this movie by sections and then explaining my answers.Expectations- Didn't have any going into the movie.Hot girls? YES.Action? YES Realism? NEVER.Effects: Lots of explosions but once again very fake/unreal.I have to say, because I went into this movie with no expectatons I cant complain too much. Although the sad thing is I only have one good thing I can say about this movie, decent looking girls to look at the whole movie. (One being Vanessa Hudgens) If I went into this movie expecting a good movie, then I would give this movie 2 stars just for not loosing my attention for TOO long. Anyways overall this movie had a lot of action, very random and dragged out unneeded/unreal fight scenes but the story is actually OK, and only OK. If I were to go really into details I would say the worst part about the movie is that the Dance Girl 'Protector' knows they stole/looked at the map, and also took a GOLD lighter (unkown cost) and assumed that they didn't take the knife, yet never even LOOKED for any of the items. All I have to say is go into this movie with low expectations and come out of them with... well... a poorly made movie that just took your lunch money. People are making tons and tons of money from this movie, I'm pretty sure half of the critics on this site could come together and make a half decent movie better than this one. Anyways enough with the dragging on, go see the movie, but sneak in if you can, its not worth your dollar.",3,3,10,20 May 2011
