Blade Runner 2049," What did I just watch...5 times now?
","I've slept through (watched) this movie 5 times now and I would have a very hard time explaining any of this movie to someone. Not because this movie is so mind-bendingly awesome but because nothing ends up happening in the whole movie. Each time I watch it I think 'this is going to be great' and as each scene comes and goes I always end up thinking, 'oh I remember that!' but that is it. Nothing sticks to my brain at all.Nothing but beautiful images and a soundtrack that as another reviewer said 'is just loud noises' and I'd have to agree. Not that I don't love the soundtrack but what the heck?! We are suppose to have a guide through this movie, any competent director would tell you that, but this just ends up getting lost in itself. It's like if you have a puppy lying on the middle of a bed and you throw your softest most beautiful and comfortable but heaviest blanket on top of the puppy. It ends up taking the puppy 2 hours and 40 minutes to come out and he is just confused. This blanket is the movie and we are the puppy. I hate to say it but not very fun.That's all I got. Watch at your own risk but I think the director ended up saying something to the effect of 'we failed making this movie because it does not entertain people enough to take them out of the real world. We made the most expensive art house movie ever.' Apparently they had a 4 hour cut at one point and the studio was toying with the idea to turn it into 2 movies. At least we can thank whoever is holy that did not happen.",3,0,0,18 October 2019
Us," Don't think about it too hard
","Here lies the story of a celebrity horror director who clearly was influenced by too much.
And here lies a story that tries so hard to be relevant/terrifying/funny/unusual by first and foremost it tries to be popular and therefore falls flat under the category of 'pretentious' because the movie takes itself as seriously as a film would.
So here lies in this shallow grave the rotting corpse of this movie, so laiden with ideas it becomes pointless, because as slick and clever as it might be there is nothing actually there.
Here we have a very engaging opening 15 minutes and an interesting (although very very flawed) ending but the middle hour of the movie is just an extended generic horror action sequence where everyone is trying to kill everyone. Hmmmm, nothing new there.
Then we have this ending...where the main character is revealed to be actually her own duplicate, switched as a child. It's not a twist if it makes no sense.
Anyway, I'm sick of writing about this.
Really frustrating when the climax of the movie denounces everything that happened before it and uses 'God' to wimp out of unimaginative script.

Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Money DiCaprio
","Cannot stand that guy.
Not sure why he thinks that once he receives enough of a salary he can stop trying.
The rest of the movie is bad also, but nothing short of the obvious fun Leo has being an actor.

Parasite," Really not great
","Just like with Snowpiercer and Okja when I think back on this movie I am forgetting it faster than I can remember. There are just too many different Genre's happening here to really give anything any sort of devoted attention.Aside from that my, oh my, how predictable. 15 minutes into the movie I knew what the first hour was gonna be about, and I was not wrong. The second act got slightly less predictable but only because it was really trying to not.It could have been much much better had the finale come up with a more interesting solution.",4,97,232,19 August 2019
