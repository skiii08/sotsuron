Casablanca," One of the best ever made
","I can't say enough about how much I love this film.  From beginning to end, I was captivated by the characters, plot, and acting.  This film stands head and shoulders above any of the high-budget money making monsters that seem to come out every weekend in modern day cinema.  The plot is so genuine, the characters and their situations are microcosms of situations I've been in, and I relate to them on a very intimate level, and the acting, well, the movie has Humphrey Bogart.  The acting is superb; second to none.  I love this movie, and I truly wish that everyone could enjoy it the same way I do.",10,1,1,11 August 1999
American Beauty," My favorite film of the year
","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from beginning to end.  One of the few life experiences I've had that made me proud to be a member of the human race. Incredible acting, amazing original screenplay, surprisingly creative yet appropriate cinematography, and all of it was put together with the faultless consistency of a noontime turkey and cheese sandwich.  Perfect rating: 10 out of 10.",Null,0,0,17 December 1999
Mulholland Drive," ~
","This is my favorite film of 2001.  In case you're a David Lynch fan and wondering, Mulholland Drive is the polar opposite of Lost Highway:  It's entertaining, the characters are interesting, casting was excellent, and on and on.  In my opinion, it deserved a nomination for best picture, but hey, Being John Malkovich, Magnolia, Memento, and Wonder Boys were also snubbed by the Academy, so I'm not surprised.",10,2,2,19 March 2002
Some Like It Hot," Dont get the joke
","I realize that this film is considered to be one of the best of all time, but I just don't get it.  The comedy of the film is infantile, Mailyn Monroe is an awful actress, and the entire story is about as believable as OJ Simpson's attack prevarication.  Perhaps the sense of humor of the American public has changed over the past 40 years, which is entirely possible, but bad acting is still bad acting.  Perhaps my sense of humor differs from the rest of those who watched this movie, which is possible to an extent.  I'm sorry, even if I were to forgive this film for it's lack of amusing moments, I would still find it incredibly mediocre.",6,3,19,11 August 1999
Kingpin," I Love This Movie
","I don't understand why this movie has such a low rating on this site, but then again, I tend to believe that most people don't fully understand Kingpin.  There are a lot of people out there that will say this is a slapstick movie, full of fart jokes and low-brow humor.  Those kind of comments frustrate me, because it's my contention that Kingpin is the best of the Farrelly brothers' movies.  In fact, Kingpin is one of my favorite movies of the 90's.  Not only is the humor in the movie a lot more complex than some people realize, the story is original, honest, and entertaining. I highly recommend this movie to anyone, and if you enjoy it half as much as I did, believe me, you won't be sorry you watched it.",10,2,5,7 November 2003
