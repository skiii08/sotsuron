"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Pegg's Marathon Movie.
","Simon Pegg shows the world that he's a capable man in a lead role. He's an ordinary, down-to-earth kind of guy, someone you'd love to have as a friend. His character, Dennis, starts off the opposite. He runs out of his fiancée Libby (Newton) on their wedding day, whilst she has a bun in the oven! How are we to relate to someone as distasteful as he? Surprisingly he pulls it off just by being himself. 5 years on, Dennis tries to win back Libby's affection by taking part in a marathon, and competing with her new man, Whit (Azaria). Director David Schwimmer (yes, Ross from Friends!) has spent time developing Dennis, but no one else. Whit has all the appealing traits (money, power, mysterious man from another country), but not the personality. He's the cocky American all us Brits are destined to hate. Newton and Azaria are underdeveloped characters. Schwimmer's potential gets bogged down by laughs and the cameos which don't quite hit the spot they're aiming for. Pegg is brilliant, and his best friend in-role Dylan Moran's on par. R,FB,R is fun, guaranteed to crack a few smiles. No matter how it ends, Pegg is still the winner.",6,0,1,15 June 2015
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," For me, Vol. 1 is the better of the two, but Vol 2. wraps it all up nicely for us.
","Vol. 2, Tarantino's fifth film, follows Uma Thurman's ass-kicking Bride on her revenge mission. Two members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad are down, two (and Bill) to go. Where Vol. 1 was a homage to Asian cinema, Vol. 2 is one to western films of old. Character story is chosen above the action this time, as 'The Bride', gets closer to who main target. Uma Thurman is outstanding. Routing for her until the very end is no issue, no matter the cost or the conclusion. Vol. 2 wraps up this very thick plot ('and so the plot thickens', says Bill) beautifully. It's not easy for The Bride. The harder it is for, the better it is for our viewing pleasure. Tarantino is hit his peak, slapping us in the face with slick music, quick edits and less dialogue than what we're use to.",8,1,2,11 February 2016
The Incredible Hulk," Incredible, not incredible?
","It boils down to this: what makes The Incredible Hulk incredible? Is it the newly appointed Edward Norton? Or love-interest Liv Tyler? Actually, it loses out on incredible credibility, as Norton's Bruce Banner chooses to flee rather than fight. He's a passive man on the run from the U.S. Army, looking for a cure. His ability to change in to a raging muscle-man is what they want. TIH covers the origin story in the opening credits (sensible move, we've seen it before with Ang Lee's The Hulk). Banner's brute only surfaces when the army won't leave him be. Leave him alone they do not, as they crunch the middle act in to overdrive. Super- human military nut-job Tim Roth makes a cool central villain (the showdown is glorious). Tyler trades whimsical damsel for astute catalyst. It's our second helping on the lead-up to an Avengers movie. Leterrier's effort is a noble one, as Marvel know what direction they're heading. And did anyone think that Norton would make a fine Banner? I didn't see that one coming.",7,0,0,28 March 2016
Mission: Impossible III," Back to its best!
","'We put an explosive charge in your head' says Hoffan's Owen Davian to MIF agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise). Then BANG! opening credits. J.J. Abrams takes Mission: Impossible back to its routes by focusing entirely on Hunt. He may have found himself a new team and a cast who prove their worth, but they're secondary to Mr. Cruise and his stunt-battling, gadget wielding, free running nutter. This franchise is his baby, and no one will stand in his way. His name printed on the posters is almost as big as the title. This third outing plays on Ethan's fears and shows you what makes him tick. Weapons dealer Davian exploits this, staying two steps ahead of Hunt and his team who're sent to find him and dispatch him. The plot doesn't thicken any more than this, it's kept ambiguous so Cruise can work his magic. Abrams' effort is marginally better than Woo's conformity, and even a stretch treacherous than the first. Hunt does his best to keep his fiancée Julia (Monaghan) blissfully unaware of his lifestyle, but she becomes involved none-the-less. Davian brings out opposite emotions in Hunt; he's a Bond-esque villain with zero quirks and a full-scale attitude. He's just what's needed for Cruise to scale, climb, fall and roll his way through set-pieces and just generally be a bad-ass son-of-a-gun. The masks are gone, but that's only a tiny blip in a revitalised franchise.",8,1,1,7 May 2015
The Finest Hours," Little development on characters, but it's definitely one tense ride!
","Picture the setup of The Perfect Storm. The Finest Hours is dreadfully similar. A clichéd American civilian becomes a hero by defying the odds (and the sea gods). There's two of them too: the not-so-liked sea-man Casey Affleck who's stranded on a ship in Cape Cod with 31 other men, and awkward coastguard Chris Pine is one of four men braving the terrible storm. The main characters are under-developed, so caring for them is challenging. The high seas are crawl, constantly barraging our saviours with terrible waves. When Pine and his crew (which involves an underused Ben Foster) reach the Chatham bar, the tensity rises and the adrenaline starts pumping. But once it's over, you'll be wishing nature would rise up again, and boost the interest levels once again.",7,0,4,7 February 2016
Source Code," Unique, thrilling and tense.
","Jake Gyllenhaal fleshes out the characters he portrays, and rightfully makes it his own. Whether it's Donnie Darko or Zodiac, he ups the ante. This is absolutely the case in Source Code. Think Groundhog Day meets the best sci-fi you can think of. Gyllenhaal is Colter Stevens, a soldier who's forced to use the Source Code: repeating a real-life train journey to Chicago, and its eventual explosion and the death of everyone on board. His mission is to find the bomb and its detonator. The investigation's only half the hoot. On the train opposite Stevens (who's in someone else's body on the train) is Christina (Michelle Monaghan), a beautiful, down-to-earth woman that knows the person Stevens has 'taken over'. Colter's subconscious actions bring them closer together, but is it a relationship destined to fail the moment he enters the Source Code? Only 8 minutes of time will tell, as director Duncan Jones successfully balances romance (or not time-travelling) with heart-stopping action.",9,4,6,23 November 2015
Skyfall," Bond has changed for the better.
","James Bond, since Daniel Craig took over, is nothing like the films of old. Casino Royale and Quatum of Solace are contemporary outings, switching cheese and swatch with seriousness and sophistication. A serious overhaul was needed. Lo and behold, Skyfall, the peak of Craig's 007. Bond comes of out hiding after an attack on M (Dench) and the MI6. Other agents are being picked off, so it's up to Bond to look after M, and once again save the day. Skyfall's got Bond written all over it, except this time it's simplified, almost going back to the beginning. As Q (now Ben Wishaw) says 'what did you expect, an exploding pen?' Bond's hurt. His pride broken, beaten and scarred. He doesn't have the time to heal with Javier Bardem's former agent testing his loyalty to M and the MI5. We learn more about Bond than we've ever known. Skyfall's simple, gripping and effective, its personal touch stands out. 007 has changed, and change is for the good.",8,2,5,14 October 2015
Catch Me If You Can," This game is good fun.
","A cat and mouse game repeated over and over sounds a tad dull, but not when it's directed by Steven Spielberg! Leonardo DiCaprio's Frank Abagnale is deceitful and deceptive, but not nasty. Instead he's huge fun to be around. Same goes for Tom Hank's catcher, who incidentally, finds it difficult to do the catching. Catch Me If You Can, to not seem too rigid or sound mundane, splices the story from when Abagnale's already captured, to the how and why, the very beginning, up until Abagnale's inevitable capture. It's a slick, cool process held strong by its two leads. I wish there was more room for Hanks to thrive, as DiCaprio fills the screen with his charm and intelligence.",8,2,4,16 January 2016
John Wick," John Wick
","Keanu Reeves is back with a vengeance. A real vengeance. John Wick is easy to follow; Wick (Reeves), having lost his wife and attended her funeral, is taking the time to mourn the one he loved. An unexpected delivery in the form of a new pet jolts him out of misery, that is until a mob of Russians break into his house, kill his dog and steal his car. They have unleashed the monster in him; he tears through New York city leaving a rather large body count in his wake. First time directors Staheski and Leitch makes John Wick an incredibly powerful film. They're known in the industry for their stunt coordination skills, so it's only right that they're at the helm. Keanu Reeves' martial arts is replaced with raw grappling and gritty kills. The action is smooth, energetic and dynamic. Reeves is ideal as the wounded hit-man, saying little and expressing emotion through his brawling. The Russian gangsters and their boss play a familiar tune. Viggo (Nyqvist) knows his son's crossed the wrong person. Humour accompanies his importance as a leader, adding value to the film's atmosphere. Topping that is the film's rich, dark blue hues in every shot, giving us a tease of NY City's underground scene. I mean, who wouldn't want to check in to a hotel where all the other hit men stay? John Wick is stylish, sophisticated and compact. A sequel is already in the works.Check out my other reviews on http://straighttelling.co.uk",9,2,7,19 April 2015
Star Trek," Star Trek XI
","J.J. Abrams has reinvigorated and revitalised the Star Trek franchise with this witty and convoluted 11th film, breaking the cursed odd film amalgamation. Scriptwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman have worked out a cunning way to keep Trek fresh for audiences old and new. The story is simple yet intricate; an alternate reality and a new time-line of events have been created due to Spock's undoing. Thus brings Chris Pine's James T. Kirk, a brash youngster that's persuaded by Bruce Greenwood's Captain Pike to join the Academy and outdo his Father's heroic actions. Events lead him to the Captain's chair of the Enterprise, where he's in charge of a group with a large personality. Quinto's (younger) Spock and Karl Urban's Bones McCoy are stand outs. Both constantly bereave Kirk for his behaviour. Simon Pegg, Anton Yelchin and John Cho bring character traits we've seen before, and manage to add new spice to them as well. Star Trek XI upholds a consistent story, but the ending isn't as grand as it feels like it leads up to. Eric Bana's Romulan captain has limited potential even if his villain is intimidating. Maybe the next outing will see a more engaging brute, but for now, Abrams has hit the spot of our sci-fi needs.",8,1,2,9 April 2015
Iron Man 2," Can't ask for much more from a sequel.
","If you appreciated Jon Favreau's Iron Man, then you'll love IM2. There's not much new on show, but once had a taste of what Tony Stark has to offer, you'll know what to expect. Although Robert Downey Jr.'s character thrives as a philanthropist and making the world a better place, unrest broods in the background. Two villains occupy Stark's attention. The maniacal Ivan Vanko (Rourke), who disproves Stark's theory that every country in the world is far behind his technology, and Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), the CEO of a competing weapons/defence manufacturer. The one that sways heads is Scarlet Johansson, the Marvel Universe's much needed heroine (sorry Pepper).Ultimately IM2 is only as strong as its hero, so pretty damn strong then. Having less superhero smash-ups and more human character development is attractive to comic- book fans and movie lovers.",7,0,3,26 March 2016
Star Trek Into Darkness," Into the Darkness We Go
","J.J. Abrams takes this new brand of Star Trek to the next level. It reaches greater heights that XI could not, starting with a hard-edged villain in the shape of Benedict Cumberbatch. He's a largely physical presence, saying little and conveying power through a stare or his baritone voice. He's more than a match for Chris Pine's Captain Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise; after a devastating attack on earth, they spend most of their time one step behind him. The alternate reality/new time-line from the previous film has now branched off like a tributary, opening up possibilities for familiar characters with different stories. Into Darkness, rather than choosing to go further afield, stays close to home, looking no further than the Academy. Cumberbatch's space-terrorist is a member of the organisation, so trust is limited for Kirk and company. Pine, Quinto and the rest are as engaging as ever, but it's Cumberbatch that hogs the spotlight. The story is even more epic than the last, and the ending boldly goes where no man has gone before. This might be a slight exaggeration, but it's a significant improvement on the first (eleventh) film.",9,3,5,10 April 2015
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," More of a man-flick than a chick-flick.
","A formidable cast have come together and provided us with what can only be described as a man's chick flick. It doesn't follow the formula seen so many times before. The main couple's relationship has already hit its peak. It comes crashing down within seconds when Emily (Moore) says to her husband Cal (Carell) that she's slept with someone else and wants a divorce. This is a punch in the gut for every loving couple out there. Crazy, Stupid, Love follows Cal dealing with what's hit him and the relationships that surround him, including his son's love for his babysitter (he's 13, she's 17) and Ryan Gosling, the womaniser he meets at a bar he drowns his sorrows in. Gosling's steers Cal into the world of the single man. Gosling is at the forefront of every scene he's in, up until the point he falls in love. It's lighthearted and fun up until it ups the severity. Smaller parts from Tomei and Bacon add flare to this heartwarming film. Apart from a little straying off, CSL is strong enough to be the best romantic-comedy out there because of its differences and loving characters.Check out my other reviews on http://straighttelling.co.uk",8,0,1,4 April 2015
Happy Gilmore," One of Sandler's best.
","The earlier Adam Sandler films, are the best. All Sandler films are harmless enough. The early ones are comical, joyful and unrealistic. This comedy ticks all those boxes. Happy Gilmore (Sandler) is a terrible hockey player with a mean swing and serious anger issues. Taking up golf under the wing of an expert (Carl Weathers), Happy smashes his way through tournaments to raise money and save his grandmother's house. Current golfing champion Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald), hating the media attention Happy's receiving, plans to cut his golfing time short. Sandler's on top, ridiculous form, his anger delivers the hardest laughs. Happy Gilmore's story produces that comic edge with its unbelievable, can-do attitude, like a script originally for an animation. The comedy heavily outweighs the plot. Happy Gilmore is easy- going.",7,0,1,24 August 2015
The Danish Girl," Redmayne and Vikander, the Oscar contenders.
","Tom Hooper is the master at covering either very grand or very taboo subjects. The Danish Girl is his most daring project yet. I'll admit I went in to this screening mildly narrow minded, and left more open to a matter I clearly know nothing about. Eddie Redmayne, who won the Oscar for The Theory of Everything last year, looks like a contender again this year for his transitional role. At first it's the mere touch of women's clothing that alerts his feelings, but that soon turns to dressing up and being someone, that in his mind, he knows he is: a woman named Lili. Although Redmayne's acting is tremendous, an award is more deserving of Alicia Vikander, who plays Redmayne's wife. The Danish Girl shows just as much her anguish, and acceptance, and the effect it has on their marriage, as it does Einar's/Lily's. The daring subject of this film may not be for everyone, but it'll certainly touch the hearts of those who do see it.",7,0,3,7 January 2016
Ted," Depends if you like Macfarlane's humour or not!
","Even the most sophisticated of people can have their immature days. Their isn't a soul out there who doesn't have a childish materialistic possession or hobby. Ted (mostly) shows how difficult is to part with it... via a talking bear. Wahlberg's character John Bennett is more man-child than sensible adult. On one side his (often) lovable fuzz-ball best friend Ted (Seth Macfarlane) is a bad influence on him. On the other side his girlfriend of four years (Mila Kunis) wants them to move further in their relationship. Ted's story is about friendship and how far that friendship can be pushed to the limit, and push others away. Wahlberg's a funny front-man, (he proved how comical he can be in The Other Guys), Seth Macfarlane has more difficulty conveying jokes through the animated toy. Thankfully most soar. There's a lot of filler jokes to bulk up the running time, and the humour can be crass, rude and often bawdy. Being a fan of Macfarlane's popular adult-cartoon Family Guy helps, but understandably his humour isn't for everyone.",7,0,0,21 June 2015
Creed," Creed follows similar Rocky routes but manages to be one of the better in the franchise due to new focus and originality.
","Fruitvale Station director Ryan Coogler has revitalised a franchise that otherwise seemed dead. Stallone wasn't keen on the idea of a new Rocky film, but with a decent script and much persistency, Coogler managed to convince him. And what a story it is! Coogler has deviated the attention to former collaborator Michael B. Jordan, who plays Apollo Creed's illegitimate son. Stallone's Balboa may be on the sidelines, but has just as much impact on us than when he was in the ring. He agrees to train the young Creed (who's going by the name of Johnson). Creed's story follows the usual pattern laid out by previous Rocky films, yet musters enough originality to place it amongst the best of them. Stallone puts in his greatest performance to date, whilst Jordan is exceptional, as he battles with his name and tires to build his own legacy. Jordan is improving over time. One of Creed's fights is shot in one, long breathless take. His fights place us in close quarters. We're there for every punch given, and every punch taken. Expect a sequel very, very soon.",8,0,2,21 January 2016
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Struggles to keep my attention.
","This origins film in the X-Men universe doesn't stand up well against the others, even compared to The Last Stand, and even with Hugh Jackman kicking ass and looking buff. Wolverine (Jackman) enters an experiment to become even stronger, and defeat his 'sworn brother' Creed (Liev Schreiber), who's on a rampage, killing the mutants that were once close to him. Creed's intentions and motifs aren't plain to see. The mutants that lack blades coming out their knuckles hugely lack character, so comic favourites Gambit (Kirsch) and Deadpool (Reynolds) are ruined. They're pawns to draw us in and take our money. I'd say don't bother with this and go straight to First Class, it's (a lot) better than XMOW by a long shot. And don't get me started on the CGI.",4,1,2,1 March 2016
Just Go with It," Just Don't Bother
","Just Go With It sits in the middle of the best and worst Adam Sandler films this side of the millennium. Many, considerable pitfalls exists. Sandler piles on the lies to get his girl. Firstly, pretending to have an ex-wife (Jennifer Aniston), because Sandler gets caught wearing his old wedding ring that scores him many girls (in his dreams). Secondly, having two children when he has none. Thirdly, his cousin Nick Swardson enters the fray, pretending to be Aniston's new German backpacker boyfriend. The lies are awful and flimsy. The charade's kept up for the entire movie. It'd be convincing if Sandler was only trying to get his leg over. Some laughs come from it, just not many memorable ones. Aniston is the prize winner here. She's the good in a jumble of mess. This film is aptly named, as if it's telling us just to go with it too.",4,16,26,21 September 2015
Spotlight," I want to know what other stories the Spotlight team have covered!
","Spotlight is a journalist-drama that the awards ceremonies will love. The content, acting and unbeatable script merge to make a dreadfully compelling story, one that doesn't scrimp or exaggerate its material to avoid hurting particular factions. Spotlight covers a monumental scandal of recent years: the cover -up of child molestation by the Catholic Church. Led by head journalist Robby (Michael Keaton), the Boston Globe's Spotlight team unravel the truth. The script is perfect, giving us information in spurts rather than spoon feeding it down our gullets. Every shock comes at a reasonable pace, dangling that juicy info I want to know. The four journalists in the Spotlight team put in some fantastic performances, but none so more than Mark Ruffalo, whose passion and assurance shines through. This is one of the most tense films without any action you will ever see.",8,1,1,1 February 2016
Yes Man," The toned down Carrey.
","Yes Man's story is fitting for Jim Carrey. It gives him plenty of material to show off his sporadic, eccentric ego. It's astonishing then, to see only flashes of Ace Ventura or Charlie/Hanks from Me, Myself & Irene. Yes Man sits comfortably between them and the likes of Eternal Sunshine and The Truman Show. Carl (Carrey) is a likable man whose lack of ambition is having a detrimental effect on himself and those closest to him. He reluctantly agrees to say yes to everything for a whole year, no matter what it is. From online dating and learning Korean to bungee-jumping and organising his best friend's fiancée's bridal shower, there's nothing he cannot, sorry, will not do. The story is one of redemption, of finding ones-self. Taking part in something that you'd later regret not doing. It's all well and good until Carrey and new love interest Zooey Deschanel get serious. A less formulaic route hits a cliché roadblock. And that's the route it takes thereon. The ending doesn't have the strength that the rest of the film carries. Carl's work partner, Rhys Darby (Flight of the Concords) is a scene stealer.",6,1,1,10 July 2015
Snatch," Better than Lock, Stock?
","Snatch is Guy Ritchie's second British masterpiece, taking the good out of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and creating a movie to match it. The narrative is hugely similar; the black comedy still pushes the envelope with brute force, a solid script delivers an intricate cast of gangsters, thugs and druggies fighting over one item: a priceless jewel. What's new? Brad Pitt as an Irish gypsy. His accent's incomprehensible, an exaggeration on a stereotype we all love to hate. Ritchie knows his British stereotypes, from the gypsy's and the hooligans (Vinnie Jones), to the cockneys (Alan Ford) and the greedy American (as the British see them). Ritchie does crime and slang like no other. Snatch is a tangle of great stories driven by a single outcome (think 2004's Crash). It's hilarious and just as good as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, if not better.",8,0,2,8 June 2015
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," No more Ewoks please.
","Return of the Jedi, episode six of the Star Wars universe, starts off where it means to push on. Han Solo (Harrison Ford) is prisoner to Jabba the Hutt, so Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and friends (R2-D2, C3P0, Leia) set out to rescue him. After a successful mission, Han and Leia lead a band of Rebels to the moon of Endor where the second Death Star is being protected by a force field, whilst Luke tries to bring Darth Vader back from the dark side of the force. The long awaited last film of the Star Wars universe ends well but falters slightly on the way. Strong detail and a quick drive pushes the plot forward, hitting a bump when the Ewoks make their appearance. Han and Leia's mission's halted by the furry little creatures, spoiling what we want to see with what George Lucas wants us to see. The humans' story is sacrificed by the Ewok's screen time. At least a spectacular big space battle and Luke's personal endeavor compensates for the events on Endor. One small blip won't trouble the fans too much.",8,1,2,27 October 2015
Black Mass," Johnny Depp back on form.
","Black Mass is supposed to be Johnny Depp's return to form. After the dismal Mortdecai earlier in the year, Depp has got some making up to do. His take on the notorious Boston gangster James 'Whitey' Bolger is one heck of a performance, one that's expected of his caliber. His transformation far exceeds the act. His piercing blue eyes is enough to make anyone flinch.This movie follows the chunk of Bolger's life accredited to his relationship with the FBI, chiefly agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton), who he knew growing up. They strike a deal; the Bureau will leave Whitey alone if he gives up the location of rival gangsters. This gives him free will to do whatever he likes, whenever he likes.Black Mass has an open narrative. A select few of Whitey's men tell stories of their time they spent with Bolger. Just as much focus goes on Edgerton as it does Depp, which greatly hinders the man we want to know more about. What we do see though, looks fantastic. The low-key lighting and the dark, gloomy exteriors fit Bolger's ever cloudy mood. This is a gangster films that broods and will be remembered for its main performer.",8,0,1,4 December 2015
The Town," Ben Affleck proves himself as director and actor.
","Certain aspects of The Town assimilate Michael Mann's Heat, as do most heist epics since its creation. Luckily enough for director/actor Ben Affleck and all on board there's plenty of new ideas that help the film stand on its own two feet. Heist expert Affleck and his crew, which consists, infiltrate a bank, kidnapping a member of staff in the process. Affleck's oddly infatuated with the kidnapped Rebecca Hall, who's unaware of who her kidnappers were. The Town follows his working life and personal life coming together. Affleck has scored as both director and actor, creating tension and feud with animosity. Affleck's is humble, the relationship with Hall is cast in romantic misery. Blake Lively's short but bitter cameo as a 'lady of the night', abusing our criminal- come-protagonist, only coming out her shell when FBI agent Jon Hamm muscles in. The person to watch out for is Jeremy Renner as Affleck's harrowing, temperamental partner-in-crime. The scene's he's in are jaw-clenching.The Town's packs enough heat to keep my interest the whole way through. Well done, Ben Affleck. Gone, Baby, Gone wasn't a fluke.",8,0,1,21 March 2016
Forrest Gump," No one does it better than Tom Hanks.
","Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is sat on a bench waiting for a bus. He's hardly the most intelligent person in the world, but he's definitely the most caring, heart-warming and relatable character to ever appear in film. Gump tells his story to other bus-waiters who come and go and only hear snippets of the whole tale. The path towards present day is packed full of events and achievements, some of which include the Vietnam war, meeting the President (twice), unveiling the Watergate Scandal and running non- stop for over four years. Sounds ludicrous. Above all else Gump has accomplished feats that would occur over many lifetimes. Tom Hanks though, fills Gump's story with tenacity. He has an eventful life, one full of ups and downs. Very sad, but very humorous. A great film controlled by its lead man.",9,3,4,15 February 2016
Gone Baby Gone," Gone, Baby, Gone is Good, Baby, Good.
","The Affleck Brothers have collaborated on a deeply political and morally moving story. Ben directs this morbid feast. Private investigators and romantic-partners Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan are on the look-out for a missing girl in Boston. Not much else is known, keeping us at a frustrating arm's length. Casey is an under-rated actor, juggling toughness with anxiety, the rights with wrongs. Gone, Baby, Gone will have us divided, scrupulously contemplating whether Affleck and Monaghan make the right decisions. Both Affleck's have heads spinning and temples aching. Boston has never looked so bleak and uninviting. Avoid watching if you're planning a trip there.",8,0,1,24 March 2016
Southpaw," Gyllenhaal is impressive as ever!
","Antoine Fuqua takes the best of other movies and makes them his own. Southpaw follows in the footsteps of classic boxing movies like Rocky, The Fighter and Warrior with its meaty, sensational fights, and The Shawshank Redemption and The Pursuit of Happiness, for making redemption its focal point. Jake Gyllenhaal seizes to amaze, outshining his work in Nightcrawler and Enemy. He's put himself through physical trauma to entertain at the highest level. Southpaw's an emotional journey, at its lowest when prestigious boxer Billy Hope (Gyllenhaal) loses his wife and the custody of his daughter. The shooting of Maureen Hope (Rachel McAdams) is one of the most terrifyingly real death in cinema history. Feelings run riot and a good deal of squirming in our seats transpires. Gyllenhaal's bulky frame, impressionable acting and connection with youngster Oona Laurence is mesmerising. The mid-section of Southpaw sees Hope fighting battles outside the ring, for his daughter by his side and to rid himself of the guilt he carries. Fuqua has upped the sentimentality, making Southpaw his most engaging film since Training Day. The ending dips in form into the pit when Billy makes his grand comeback, but this doesn't matter too much, as Hope, and Gyllenhaal for that matter, are mainly winners outside the ring.",9,4,8,13 August 2015
Ant-Man," Don't judge it by its trailers.
","Ant-Man's the underdog of the Marvel Universe. The smallest in size, the biggest personality. Paul Rudd's expert thief Scott Lang's the most likable, easy going hero in the MCU. He's a funny, charming ex-con who has a lot to lose if he's caught stealing again. Unfortunately for Scott, he's forced in to a situation where he has to 'break in to a place and steal some stuff', for the sake of the world. His new mentor, Dr. Hank Pym (Douglas) wants Scott to stop his old pupil (Corey Stoll) from building a new range of high-tech weapons for warfare. Ant-Man's not your typical superhero-origin story. What makes it a cut above the other Marvel movies is how he becomes the hero. The suit and its powers are odd. The ability to control ants is a strange but a much more impressive feat than originally assumed. Ant-Man's trailer doesn't do the film justice, because this is a bonafide superhero feast.",8,0,5,26 July 2015
The Godfather: Part II," The greatest sequel ever made?
","Pacino outdoes himself in The Godfather. He's just as powerful as Brando was in the role of The Don. Michael Corleone (Pacino) expands his cartel, making friends and enemies alike. Michael's story is spliced with his father's uprising. Vito is played by the mesmerising Robert De Niro. Vito's story could stand alone from Michael's, but both compliment the other in ways that cannot be described. Scenes end on cliffhangers. When one starts, we want to be back with the other. The Corleone family is corrupt, and Part II just shows how deep their roots run. This second act is more intense, more involving, incredibly climactic, leaving it's audience wanting more. Absolutely fine displays from Pacino and De Niro. The Godfather: Part II almost outdoes its predecessor.",10,2,3,6 December 2015
Hot Rod," A movie that can do no harm.
","If you're not a fan of silly jokes, then this isn't for you. And I'm not talking Adam Sandler's silly, one-dimensional garbage, I'm talking so silly it's almost clever. Will Ferrell was suppose to take the lead role of the high-flying, amateur stuntman, instead the task goes to Andy Samberg, who's decent enough, if not a little unimaginative. Alongside on-screen brother Jorman Taccone and friends Bill Hader and Danny McBride, there's fun to be had, but not enough to propel the story. Some moments outdo others, mainly the ones involving the unwell Ian McShane, whom Samberg is trying to raise money for. They fight and they squabble, and Samberg's only doing this good deed so he can finally beat up his step-dad. Hot Rod is mildly funny, somewhat enjoyable, doing little harm in the process.",6,0,0,13 January 2016
The Italian Job," Not many reasons to call this 'The Italian Job'.
","The latest version (there being only two.....so far) of The Italian Job has no merit to its name. Director F. Gary Gray and screenwriters Troy Kennedy-Martin and Donna Powers have taken the best out of Michael Caine's original (three Mini's in a car chase, one thought-out heist) and glamourised it (Hollywood A-listers, pristine, clean shots) but with out the charge and the adrenaline we assume that's there. Wahlberg is a flat front-man. Edward Norton makes for a surprising bad guy, annoying and outsmarting Croker (Wahlberg) and his team left, right and centre. The other cast members struggle due to a lackluster script and and its inability to succeed our expectations. You'll be least disappointed in this film if you get the chance to watch this before the 1969 classic.",5,0,1,23 May 2015
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The Fellowship of the Ring - the beginning of a flawless blockbuster trilogy.
","Some may think this a biased review, but I grew up reading J.R.R. Tolkien's books and watching The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I love them. They have everything I could possibly want out of a story. The Fellowship of the Ring encompasses nine companions; an elf, a dwarf, two men, a wizard and four hobbits (or halflings or small- folk). They're on the biggest fantasy-adventure ever to hit a book or screen; destroy a powerful ring so Middle-Earth (the land in which they reside) isn't covered with a 'second' darkness. The only way they can unmake what has been made is by throwing the ring into the fiery depths of Mt. Doom, but it's not an easy journey, as many troubles hit them, with the ring being a huge burden on ring-bearer Frodo (Elijah Wood). There's so many underlying themes that LotR has something for everyone; friendship, love, good vs. evil and facing unbelievable odds are just a few of them. What makes The Fellowship of the Ring so special is Peter Jackson's ability to draw us into a rich world that's a complete, visual masterpiece. CGI is used sparingly, the team behind the magic relying on costume, make-up and locations made from scratch. The script manages to push the story forward, yet give us time to know each member of the Fellowship. Howard Shore's score is unblemished, giving me tingles and poignantly touching in a way most music only tries to be. For a cast so big, you'd think someone would stand out, but not here. Everyone is superb. The Fellowship of the Ring is a perfect block-buster and start to a trilogy that will be very, very hard to beat.",10,0,0,2 February 2016
Man of Steel," Awesome superhero film with added excitement for what's to come.
","Only 7 years have past since the release of Superman Returns. Brandon Routh must be kicking himself right now. It was easy to see where Warner Brothers/DC were going with Man of Steel. Making superhero movies that overlap similar to the Marvel Cinematic Universe will be no simple task. Lovers of all things DC are excited for what's to come. Zack Snyder was a good choice, replacing the 'rumoured' Christoper Nolan in the Director's chair. Man of Steel is hard, rough, often accompanied by a sheen to the surface that J.J. Abrams would be proud of. Henry Cavill has the steel to fill the boots of this now hardened superhuman. He battles with inner struggles, both as Clark Kent and the hero, always on the move, never being totally accepted. All eyes fall on him when an evil tyrant from Krypton wants to save his race by annihilating Earth's. The chaos that ensues Michael Bay would be proud of. Man of Steel is heavy on CGI, but not so much that it strips away the story. Kent and journalist Lois Lane's (Adams) romance is quick off the mark, never as meaningful as it should be. The editing can be a little clunky. MoS marches quickly from scene to another, sometimes getting lost on the way, but mostly packing a lot of intensity into its 2 hour running time. The pressure's now on for Snyder to kill Dawn of Justice. July 2016 couldn't come any quicker.",8,1,4,28 July 2015
Cast Away," Hanks doesn't need anyone else around him to be amazing.
","Tom Hanks is an incredible actor. He never ceases to amaze his audience. He's truly alone in over two-thirds of Cast Away. Chuck (Hanks) is a Fed-Ex manager who ends up stranded on a small island after the plane crashes that he's aboard. Much hardship and toil follow, as Chuck tackles with the forces of nature. There are no stand-out scenes, no music, no non-diagetic sounds, only Hanks and the materials he can use around him. It's a absolutely phenomenal performance, sorrowful and weirdly joyful, with Hanks at his best when he's alone. His single friend, Wilson (a football), almost resonates human emotion through Hanks' communication with him. Robert Zemeckis has done well with relying on their solitary performer.",8,0,0,18 February 2016
The Revenant," A cinema viewing that satisfies all senses.
","The Revenant satisfied all my senses on levels beyond my wildest imagination. Shot in natural light, director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (best known for his work on Gravity and Birdman) have outdone themselves with a scope and magnitude which I can't even begin to describe. The Revenant is raw, placing us in the life of Hugh Glass, a frontiersman in 1820's America, fighting for his life and seeking revenge after being left for dead. It's violent, tense and nerve- wracking, even when there's little going on. It never feels too long, even at 156 minutes. It starts with the most intense scenery to grace the big screen since Saving Private Ryan. Emmanuel Lubezki's camera ducks, dives and weaves around frontiersman and native Indians in one, brutal battle. He takes us from one death to another, over hills, under water, never favouring one side over the other, and yet we're still routing for our favourites, even though we've just met them. Leo's sublime, the hardships he ensure makes him an awards contender. He goes through unimaginable tasks most actors wouldn't. Tom Hardy, Domhnall Gleeson and Will Poulter are great alongside him, the latter quivering his way brilliantly through the film. I haven't come out of the cinema feeling in cold, in shock, and mostly, in awe. The Revenant is a must see on the big screen.",10,1,4,19 January 2016
Bridge of Spies," Bridge of Spies is a thrilling drama with a witty script.
","Steven Spielberg. Tom Hanks. Mark Rylance. Joel Coen. Ethan Coen. Five reasons to love this film. Spielberg's directing is top notch, Hanks and Rylance's acting's cutting edge and the Coen's writing adds comedy to a serious film. There are two parts to Bridge of Spies. First part sees Hanks' lawyer defending Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Rylance) during the Cold War. In the second part Hanks' James B. Donovan negotiates a prisoner exchange; Abel for a captured American pilot. The coming together of the cast and crew make Bridge of Spies a riveting watch. Tensions are constantly high, even though there's minimal action. The few jokes spread throughout make it no less thrilling. Mark Rylance and Hanks are superb. It's hard to say whether one outdoes the other when they share the screen time.",9,1,3,14 December 2015
Pitch Black," Little originality but still a decent thriller.
","Pitch Black is a decent cross-genre movie, that ups the ante the deeper it goes. Starting as a fight for survival, PB is an upheaval of frights for the marooned party we know so little about, on an unknown planet after their plane crashes. With limited food, water and no shelter, the odds are against them, especially with a known murderer in their midst. The temperature drops, sun begins to fade, and the creepy crawlies come out to play. Pitch Black holds no originality to its name, displaying facets of thrillers like Alien and Predator. The computer-generated beasts riddling the survivors' breathing space are imaginative; covered by the darkness to make our imaginations run wild, but also to hide the fact the CGI is below par. The darkness settles, scaring them and us respectively. One terrifyingly cool scene sees the group fending off hordes of monsters with big glow sticks. At the time in 2000 none of the actors were glowing stars. This means everyone and no one can survive, from Diesel's hard-edged mystery man to Radha Mitchell's likable captain. All you need to know is what's right in front of you. Like other thrillers, the who's and the hows aren't necessary.",7,2,2,23 May 2015
Warrior," Warrior is Incredible Entertainment
","Wow, where to begin? It's hands down the finest sports film since the 80's. The two brother's story is just as enthralling as the mixed martial arts fighting. Clocking in at just over 140 minutes, Warrior distributes time evenly on developing its characters as its does on the fighting. The two brothers have incredible back stories, neither of which force the viewers bias in any shape or form, making the MMA tournament that they both enter enticing, fulfilling and aesthetic. Tommy Conlon (Hardy) trains under his father Paddy (Nick Nolte), learning discipline and eager to be the best. Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) fights for his family and the money to stop his home from being repossessed. Polar opposite motives and personalities. Their one, common ground lies in their mistrust for their ex-alcoholic father. The Conlon brother's first on-screen meeting's even more suspenseful than De Niro and Pacino in Heat. Warrior would lose points in its one-of-two-ways foreseeable ending if it weren't for how tense it is. A. Must. Watch.",10,1,3,15 August 2015
Silver Linings Playbook," Lawrence and Cooper nail it.
","David O. Russell's collaboration with Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence can be seen as a work of art and a dour mess. Just like Picasso's paintings, Silver Linings Playbook, with no reason behind its title, feels broken but whole at the same time. The on-screen duo, who're mentally unwell for different reasons, juxtapose the convoluted story. They're not the most likable singularly, but put together they're a tour de force. Both are equally outstanding; Cooper's Pat wants to win back his wife and the only way to do that is to help out Lawrence's Tiffany. As they grow closer, they become stronger characters that I'd happily watch over and over again.",7,0,1,11 January 2016
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Ticks all the right boxes
","Rogue Nation pushes all the right buttons. It's exactly what's wanted from the MI franchise, and never tries to surpass that fulfillment. Tom Cruise is leaner and fitter than he's ever been, running faster than the speed of light and performing impressive stunts that top Ghost Protocol. SPOILER, the infamous plane scene smashes us in the face before the title credits roll. The IMF (Impossible Mission Force) has been disbanded by the CIA, forcing Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) on the run. Rogue Nation's a double cat and mouse game, with the CIA searching for Hunt, and Hunt searching for the secret organisation: the Syndicate. The plot's topsy turvy, simple to follow but almost, just almost, pointless. The Syndicate, led by Sean Harris' Solomon Lane, is hell bent on taking out the IMF, or rather, Ethan Hunt, because the CIA already took care of that. Brushing this aside entirely, RN is a blast. It's villain is under cast, but the rest of the compliment Cruise. Simon Pegg is back for another round of wit as the tech-guy, used on the field even more this time. New girl Rebecca Ferguson kicks ass, given more to do than Renner and Baldwin put together. The fifth film in the franchise ticks all the right boxes; great, fast-paced action, high speed chases, novelty gadgets and nerve- wracking stunts. Evennn the face masks make a comeback. Let's hope that Jack Reacher director Christopher McQuarrie handles the next excursion.",8,0,2,17 August 2015
American History X," Its performances make this a standout film.
","Utterly outstanding performances from the two Edwards (Norton and Furlong). American History X is a fine blend of drama and thriller, a story behind the leader of a neo-nazi cultist Derek Vinyard (Norton), seen from the eyes of his younger brother Danny (Furlong). AHX flicks from flashbacks of Derek's rise (head of a cult) and fall (murder), and rise again (redemption), to his present day atonement. Derek's crime is one of the most violent off-screen acts in cinema history. Danny looks up to his older brother, slowly but surely following his footsteps. It's down to Derek to put things right. This film sticks to the back of the mind, because the representation of its immoral actions are heavy, powerful and a harsh kick on reality regarding hate-crime.",9,1,2,16 July 2015
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," It's a geekgasm.
","Need a director to characterise a video game, comic book and action movie in one medium? Edgar Wright's your man. You don't need to be a nerd in order to enjoy Scott Pilgrim's adventure. Just a childhood fashioned with intricacy and a longing for 'that girl'. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World's starts how it intends to go on, its opening credits are loud and bright, and there's more to extract from it too. It plays on our geeky side whilst gaining new audiences. Sounds from Zelda: A Link to the Past are sly but obvious to some, 'SMACKS!' and 'THWONKS!' make a show like we're watching the original Batman, as do homages to Japanese Manga, Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat and all sorts of fictional clientèle. But is it all real for Scott? Michael Cera's lovable rogue blossoms when he meets Ramona (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and immediately falls for her. Is she real or fantasy? Either way, Scott must defeat her 7 evil exes in order to gain her love. Each new ex brings a new style of play. It's consistently stunning and breathtaking, and non of it makes any sense. The best thing to do with SPvsTW is to go along with it. Cera is a relatable frontman, worrying about how his hair looks and seeing his ex-girlfriend. Strong support comes from Scott's nosy sister Kendrick, his gay best-friend Aces (Culkin), his band mates, and all the exes, especially Chris Evans' movie star (who cracks his neck in time with Universal's theme tune) and Jason Schwartman. Go with the flow. It doesn't make a lot of sense, and it doesn't need to.",10,0,1,28 April 2015
Inside Out," An incredible animation for everyone.
","Pixar are back with a blast. An absolute mind-blast. Inside Out is the most brilliantly thought out, original animation in Pixar's history. For all audiences to enjoy. Centering on a young girl named Riley, there is two sides to her story. The external one is simple: Riley and her parents move away from their home in Minnesota where she grew up, to downtown San Francisco. The internal one is more complex. An assortment of characters make up Riley's emotions. Very similar to The Numbskulls in The Beano comic. There's Joy (Poehler), Fear (Hader), Anger (Black), Disgust (Kaling) and Sadness (Smith). They control Riley's actions and reactions. Her brain is a complex machine. New memories are created, shaped in to colours matching the emotion (yellow for joy, blue for sadness etc.) and filed in to a huge maze-like database. There's the core memories, powering certain parts of Riley's personality. They part from their usual spot that keeps the cogs spinning, throwing Riley's external emotions in to chaos. Joy and Sadness, separated from the brain's hub, need to make their way back before Riley loses her personality traits completely. Inside Out is a joyful experience, even when it's sad. A movie for the masses. A playful understanding on how certain minds work, how families can come together, and how life needs every emotion once in a while. Furthermore, an imaginary friend named Bing Bong's the best imaginary friend ever imagined.",10,2,25,3 August 2015
The Fault in Our Stars," The Fault in Our Stars
","Cancer is a wobbly subject. A complete taboo. Western cinemas have covered very little, maybe because it's an illness we like to brush under the carpet. The Fault in Our Stars guides us on a young couple's journey of illness, romance and perseverance. The story is the toughest there is to watch. Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort put in some brave, compelling performances, ones that are warming and emotional. TFiOS covers how it effects others as well. It's first half is sweet and endearing. The second is nothing short of sad. Expect tears to flow by the end.",Null,0,0,16 June 2015
Bridesmaids," Hilariously unpoetic
","Bridesmaids proves (not that it needs to) that women are just as funny, if not funnier than men. Rudolph Maya's five bridesmaids are boldly colourful. Her oldest friend Annie (Kristen Wiig) is constantly at blows with Rose Byrne's super-rich Helen. Exceedingly raucous and chaotic events take place on the lead up to Maya's wedding. Wiig is the central character to this story, and alongside Melissa McCarthy in her first major role, have the biggest laughs. There are too many strong moments, but if I had to pick two, one would be a scene involving a battle of emotions during an engagement party speech, and the other is Wiig trying to catch the attention of police officer Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd), who's the only real male representative in Bridesmaids. The shoe's on the other foot with Wiig's love-interest O'Dowd, like a gender-swap needed to happen in the big, bad Hollywood. It'll all make sense when you watch this alarming comedy.",8,0,0,10 January 2016
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Surprisingly great stuff!
","It's best to approach Tucker and Dale vs. Evil on a whim. Having previously watched horrors like Wrong Turn and The Hills Have Eyes will add significant satire. Tucker (Tudyk) and Dale (Labine) are your average red-necks; harmless on the inside even if a little intimidating on the outside. They're on vacation at their new 'cabin in the woods'. Travelling in their proximity is a group of college kids who think Tucker and Dale mean them harm. The key message here is to not judge a book by its cover. The preppy youngsters attack the hillbilly duo because they think they're attacking them. The events that unfold thereafter mock all serious gore films. It's genuinely funny, sporting the look of a horror and the feel of a comedy. The freak accidents threatening to kill off all the preps will have you in stitches, whilst Tucker and Dale are blissfully (or stupidly) unaware of how bad things are getting. The film's consistent, playing against all traditions. Tucker and Dale vs. Evil isn't one to miss.",8,0,0,7 September 2015
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Crazy, Good Fun
","Mission: Impossible IV, also known as Ghost Protocol, holds many variations from its forebears. First, is its name. It's edgy, unique and stands out from the previous three. Second, is Ethan's (Cruise) new team. A strong cast backs Cruise. Pegg is a massive breath of fresh air with his light, off-handed humour. He's been upgraded from desk boy to field agent. Patton is the new kick-ass beauty and Renner adds muscle that's not particularly needed because Cruise has all other areas covered. The story is unsurprisingly straight forward; Ethan and co. have a new villain (Nyqvist) to take down who's crippled the IMF (Impossible Mission Force). Nyqvist has been scripted with a bland, lifeless persona. He only shows quality of any worth the moment his life ends. Just one negative point amongst a trifle of goods. Tom is as daring as ever, toppling his stunts in II and III with one that will leave you with clenched butt-cheeks and sweaty palms. The gadgets are incredible and the set-pieces are superb. One in Dubai flowing smoothly into another taking place in a dust storm. Cruise and director Brad Bird have achieved the right level of action and emotion with this MI outing. Let's hope they stick with this formula in future films.",8,4,5,11 May 2015
Legend," A Double Dose of Hardy
","Two doses of Tom Hardy. Can't get any better than that, right? He's got the looks, brings the power, exudes fear. He is the right man for this role, and proves it just so. The Kray brothers are notorious gangsters, running the underground scene of London in the 1960's. Ronnie Kray (Hardy) is unhinged, sporadic and very open with his sexuality. Reggie Kray (Hardy) is the balanced one, collective, calm, but quick to anger. Legend covers their tremendous rise to their speedy decline. Hardy manages to portray two separate personalities without effecting the other. Ronnie is funny, Reggie is serious. Both personalities are as astounding as the other, neither outdoing the other. Legend is a gangster film at heart, putting family above all else, full of honour, intimidation and violence. Gangster fans, rejoice, Legend is amongst the best of its genre.",Null,3,5,21 September 2015
Drive," Very powerful film-noir-style cinema.
","Ryan Gosling is only known as The Driver, a movie stuntman that earns a few extra bob as the getaway man during heists. A particular job goes awry when helping the ex-con husband of the woman he gets close to. Less is absolutely more as Gosling gathers the attention with a forceful presence and few chosen words. A hard look and a slight expression is all that's needed to sway ours and Mulligan's affection. Drive's dialogue is compact, only making a show when the mise-en-scene needs a small boost. It's powerful cinema that's grandiose and slightly arty. Drive is one tense thriller, with intricate characters (including Bryan Cranston and Oscar Isaac) and an explosive story, never relaxing until it comes to an end.",9,1,1,2 November 2015
X-Men: The Last Stand," Not so bad when you get your head past the shocks.
","Bryan Singer should have never declined The Last Stand. The reigns went to Brett Ratner, who's taken us on a severe roller-coaster of emotions. Now having watched this more than once, I can safely say I feel warmer towards it, knowing full well what takes place, and to be honest, it's not all that bad. TLS doesn't stand up to X2, but it has big guts with a battle to end all battles. The government are giving mutants a 'choice', by providing an antidote to cure them of their powers. Whilst some mutants accept this bargain, others refuse and unite against this 'threat'. Stuck in the middle are the X-Men, who have Jean Grey to contend with. Her powers are too strong for her to handle. Her alter-ego Phoenix threatens to destroy everything. The Last Stand is both riveting and insanely annoying, because it dare do what other superhero films (or most of films for that matter) do not. The aggravation comes from certain events being brushed swiftly under the carpet. The end show-down more than makes up for the haphazard middle section, so it does not end on such a sour note.",6,1,1,1 March 2016
Room," A blend of sweet and heartbreaking cinema.
","The depth and quality in Room stretches further than most emotional, heartbreaking films. If you're aware of the Fritzl case back in 2008, or any similar besides, there's a fair few hardships to view when watching Lenny Abrahamson's rare gem. Brie Larson, known as Ma, has been trapped in 'room' for several years. Her son Jack (Jacob Tremblay), who's just turned 5, has never been outside. His world is inside the four walls that surround them. This is sweet, sentimental material, but so, so agonising, showing the strengths of a relationship between mother and son, and their ability to overcome the odds. Larson is impeccable, a beautiful performance that'll have you smiling then crying moments later. The young Jacob Tremblay is a sensation, playing a part that would seem impossible for someone to even comprehend at such an age. Room is more than anything a love story, with added thrills and drama. Highly recommended viewing.",Null,1,6,31 January 2016
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The Battle of Helm's Deep gives me chills.
","The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers immediately starts where The first film ends. The Fellowship have split, Merry (Monaghan) and Pippin (Boyd) are captured by the enemy, with Aragorn (Mortensen), Legolas (Bloom) and Gimli (Rhys-Davies) in pursuit. Ring-bearer Frodo (Wood) and his trusted companion Sam (Astin) continue their quest to destroy the ring. Although the Fellowship's disbanded, they are united under one cause; to prevent the Dark Lord Sauron from taking over Middle Earth.New friends, enemies and obstacles are met along the way. Men become the focal point in this one, represented by Rohan and Gondor. Are they strong enough to defeat their common enemy? Will old alliance's with Elves and one another come together when they most need it? New themes accompany the old. The few are against many. Even in impossible circumstances the forces of good will try. The love between Aragorn and elven princess Arwen (Tyler) is threatened by morals and a lady of Rohan. The Two Towers almost surpasses TFotR in terms of quality and depth. Howard Shore's composition is just as powerful than before, and the effects team up the ante with the biggest, jaw-dropping battle to rival Gladiator's or Saving Private Ryan's. J.R.R. Tolkien's work can do no wrong in the hands of Peter Jackson and his writing crew.",10,0,1,3 February 2016
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Tarantino at his best!
","Films number four and five of Quentin Tarantino's, Kill Bill: Vol. 1 and Kill Bill: Vol. 2 are his most racy and daring, and easily my favourites. It's a revenge story at its greatest; Uma Thurman's The Bride (her real name's undisclosed for reasons unexplained) has a list, to kill those who've done her severe harm, starting with the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (who she was a part of), and finishing with their leader, Bill. Nothing will stand in The Bride's way, not even a mother's love for her daughter or hordes of the Yakuza. Blood is shed (lots of it), many lives are lost, all for our entertainment. The story is delivered with panache. Every character is phenomenal, Thurman's being the only we can (and want) to relate to. Vol. 1 is also a homage to Asian martial arts films. It's dark humour and outrageous gore takes the edge off what could be a serious film. Vol. 2, on the other hand, takes a different turn.",9,1,3,9 February 2016
Jurassic World," Reinvigurated Entertainment
","Dinosaurs are making a comeback, and there isn't a better time for it. 14 years have passed since the disappointing JPIII, so expectations are mixed. Has all been forgiven and forgiven, or will Universal's biggest franchise crumble? Thankfully the first route's taken, with a movie that's bold, clever and fresh. Jurassic World pays tribute to the original, sending waves of sentimentality and nostalgia down our spines. It also manages to be widely entertaining, accommodating new concepts that will satisfy fans old and new. Jurassic World smashes our way of thinking into the dust. A theme park is (actually) open. Park goers have declined in the last 10 years (believe it or not) and velociraptors are being trained to obey by an ex-navy marine. There are two main protagonists; one crunches numbers, relying on excellent statistics to keep the park up and running (Dallas Bryce Howard), the other believes in the natural order of things (Chris Pratt). Both portray contradictory feelings towards the park's new creation, the Indominus-Rex. Howard believes genetic mutation is the step forward to success, whilst Pratt sees this creature as an undefined project. A political stance is at the foreground of this movie, as well as a dino-disaster, a subtle romance, an all-out actioner and a rescue mission to boot. All sub-plots file in nicely with the bigger picture, and flow in nicely with what else is in store for the franchise. This is a big blockbuster movie. Expect even bigger things to come.",8,13,35,20 June 2015
Mission: Impossible II," Mission Possible
","Everything that made Mission: Impossible rare has been peeled away. There's no intense set-pieces, no nifty gadgets and no kick-ass team. Mission: Impossible 2 is a not so impossible mission for one. Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt has the looks, fortitude and strength the women swoon over and the men crave to be. Stripped of it's unconventional anecdotes, John Woo's M:I-2 is just another generic action movie. Cruise's greatest feat is performed before the opening credits feature and the only aspect of an impossible mission comes from Hunt's love interest Nyah (Thandie Newton), who goes undercover to find out the whereabouts of a disease called Chimera from 'crime-lord' Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott in fine villainous form). For a good chunk of the film's second act, Ethan has little to do. Newton's work overstays its welcome. When the twists and turns eventually arrive it's too little, too late. At least Cruise, with his silky mane, looks like he's having a blast, it's just a pity it can't be said for the rest of us. Even the life-like face masks are missing. It's absence is only short lived. In the mean time, Cruise gallivanting the globe will have to do.",5,0,1,7 May 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Deep, dark, and a little horrifying.
","Too many cooks? Not when Joss Whedon's concerned. Age of Ultron follows Assemble tidally, keeping Marvel's phase 2 films in tip top condition. Ultron has the comic edge, but now with added ambivalence and cloudiness. Think Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire compared to its predecessors. It's dark, convoluted and sometimes frightening. Not for the very young or the faint hearted. The Avengers work together effortlessly, whether its making dinner, friendly repartee or kicking ass. The hot-headed Bruce Banner (Ruffalo) and the seductive Black Widow's (Johansson) romance ignites, the Cap (Evans) and Tony Stark (Downey. Jr) clash often. Thor's (Hemsworth) hammer has just as much flare as he does and we see a side to Hawkeye (Renner) we've never seen before. Stark and Banner's AI product Ultron (voiced by the incredible James Spader) brings out the best and the worst in the Avengers. They unite to kill the unkillable, but sibling 'mutants' Quicksilver (Taylor Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Olsen) stand in their way. Age of Ultron doesn't just develop important characters, it casts new ones, keeps the story interesting (albeit a little confusing) and manages to tease us with what's to come. Well done Joss Whedon, well done.Check out my other film reviews on http://straighttelling.co.uk",8,4,11,3 May 2015
Everest," Too many characters blunt Everest.
","Everest stars Jason Clarke and Jake Gyllenhaal, two tour leaders who band together on the lucky day of the year (10th May) and tackle Mt. Everest. Various A-listers are amongst them, some making the ascent (Josh Brolin, John Hawkes), others are part of the story in different ways (Sam Worthington, Keira Knightley). The two groups face peril when a storm hits. You can see where this is going. Disaster are on a middle level scale. Everest is gorgeously shot, the mountain friendly during the day, by night an active presence waiting for its next victim. The snow is blinding, and the sheer steeps and drops will put off any acrophobian. The A-listers' performances are just as grand as the mountain, but almost no emotion is sent their way because their numbers outstrip our emotional demand. In the end Clarke and co. never get the recognition they deserve.",6,3,5,30 September 2015
Mission: Impossible," Cruise and De Palma deliver the goods.
","Tom Cruise and Brian De Palma deliver on so many levels with Mission: Impossible. It makes Pierce Brosnan's 007 era look dismal. The story is a complete maze full of gadgets, chaos, traitors and twists that's still as hard to comprehend the second, or even the third time round. De Palma has Cruise at the rudder of every scene, taking on an impossible mission to single handedly uncover the mole who betrayed him and his team. The organisation suspect him to be the rat, so choices are limited. From Prague to Washington and then to London, Ethan Hunt's hunt is cool, full of trust issues, face masks, Emmanuelle Beart's gorgeous agent trying to prove Hunt's innocence, tense set pieces and adrenaline fueled action. One particular nerve-racking scene sees Hunt infiltrating a secure vault with sound detectors and a touch sensitive floor. One of the tensest scenes in film history.",8,1,1,5 May 2015

","There isn't many actors that can stand alone in a horror movie. Ethan Hawke manages just this. Although his character has a family, Ellison (Hawke) spends his waking hours in solitary confinement, or rather, his office, writing a book about a murder that happened in the house he currently resides. His wife and children are kept out of the loop, therefore, they are the ones to suffer. A sinister presence lurks in the shadows, waiting to tear Ellison's family apart. This is gorgeously shot. Ironically the nasty, scary hubbub happens when the sun's gone down. The house is populated by shadows and dim lights. You'd think Ellison would turn a light or two on. The story is strong; governed by a murderer that's been killing since the 60's. It's down to Ellison and Ellison alone to discover the truth. 8mm videos are his only source, and they're highly disturbing, and not for the faint-hearted. Sinister's shocks come with such perfect precision. It's scary, but mostly jumpy. Hawke is superb, becoming a nervous wreck the deeper in to this case he gets. Liqueur is his only company because his family manage to sleep through all the chaos that occurs. Sinister is a great horror, and will be remembered for its shocking material and creepy killer.",7,0,1,16 June 2015
Reservoir Dogs," Stunning work for first time director Tarantino.
","Reservoir Dogs is Quentin Tarantino's first movie. It's not clear that he had a low budget to play with, because what he's done with it is superb. A robbery gone wrong force a group of criminals, only known by different colours (Mr. White, Mr. Pink etc.) into an abandoned warehouse, to await help. In the mean time, they work out who the mole is. Tarantino fleshes out characters motives with a speech driven screenplay, music that defines memory and the ability to play on our imaginations. Madsen, Buscemi, Keitel and Roth are astutely incomparable, their given names matching their sporadic personalities. Reservoir Dogs is a profound start to Tarantino's career; one that's hard to beat with an unbeatable style, fast paced dialogue and an unforgettable scene that, whenever Stuck in the Middle With You by Stealers Wheel comes on, springs to mind instantly.",9,0,0,26 January 2016
Limitless," Bradley Cooper is a capable front-man.
","Limitless is Bradley Cooper's first crack at a leading role. He pulls it off as a head strong, cocky man, on the upward slope after coming in to contact with a drug that releases 100% of his brain's ability. The drug is the captivating yet corrupt attraction, with Cooper's freshly obtained confidence and comatose knowledge being something we'd love to experience. Blah's (Cooper) rapid ascent has its setbacks though. Juggling a relationship with unchecked intelligence, a crazed Russian on his case and a stock exchange job under Robert De Niro threatens to engulf a simple plot. Instead, director Neil Burger manages to unravel it neatly by soundly crossing them over. The script is direct, aided by Cooper's voice-over and the plot's enhanced by firm acting. Unlocking the brain's full power could take us to places unimaginable. Thankfully a realistic approach is taken to avoid doubt amongst its viewers.",8,1,1,14 August 2015
Sicario," Just Amazing
","Sicario, starring Emily Blunt, Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin, is a giant explosion, right to our senses. Blunt is a straightforward FBI agent whose world is turned upside when she's called upon to join a team that tackle the drug issues on the U.S./Mexico border. Things aren't what they seem as she's kept out of the loop. Brolin's the head of the operation and Del Toro is an associate with a mysterious persona and few, choice words. We're with Blunt all the way, knowing just as little, but feeling just as restless. Some tense scenes make the heart stop. A stand off on the border shows Sicario's peak in tensity. When Blunt's not being shot at, she's collecting thoughts and gathering emotions. Sicario's not just a powerful action film, with stunning performances from its leading trio, it's a thrilling drama as well, hitting the emotions hard and leaving you reeling at the same time.",10,3,8,1 October 2015
Pulp Fiction," Tarantino strikes again with his 2nd film.
","Pulp Fiction: Quentin Tarantino's second film. Is it just as rich and mighty as Reservoir Dogs? Yes. This time, a budget and a cast come along for the ride, a ride that's chopped up into four stories circling a handful of people. There's a mob boss, the mob boss's wife, a boxer, a pair of raucous gangsters and a couple who resemble the contemporary Bonnie and Clyde. Now, you need to look at Pulp Fiction as an adaptation of a comic, and less as a linear story. There's no broad plot, only a smattering of small stories linking the oddballs on display. Surprisingly its style works wonders. Its cool, edgy, bombastic and just as outrageous (if not more) as Tarantino's first film, Reservoir Dogs. Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta and Uma Thurman make the biggest impact with personalities hard to beat. The dialogue is heavy, but witty and clever, the soundtrack glorious and the movie is wrought with memorable scenes. Mentionable moments include Thurman and Travolta's dancing, Jackson's reciting of a passage from the bible, and Travolta's accident. Tarantino proves that his first attempt at filmmaking wasn't a lucky one.",8,1,2,26 January 2016
Jack Reacher," Fast paced action from McQuarrie.
","Jack Reacher upset the fans of the book way before its release date. Firstly, because the film's based on book nine, One Shot, of Lee Child's bestsellers, not the first. And secondly, Tom Cruise is nothing like Jack Reacher's supposed to be: tall, burly, very masculine. Placing this aside, Christopher McQuarrie's action is solid. The 'guess who' investigation focuses on the murder case and the lead investigator. Reacher is mysterious yet likable, intelligent and tough. An outsider who the women love and the men hate. He's called upon by the suspect of five random murders by sniper. He doesn't believe the suspect murdered these people. Reacher and defense attorney Helen (Rosamund Pike) set out to uncover the truth. Cruise is no newcomer to this genre. Cruise swaps shocking stunts for raw energy. In one scene Reacher's in real danger, having us believe he is rather than think he'll escape unscathed. All aspects of Jack Reacher are executed with precision. There's no room for filler. The investigation is snappy, the action quick but memorable. Rosamund Pike adds emotion when confronting the deceased victims' relatives. Jack Reacher will gain new fans at the expense of its old ones. This is for the first-timers, not the old-timers.",8,1,2,5 August 2015
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Loc, Stock and Christ this is a good film!
","Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a British film with bona fide, British humour. A bunch of bombastic, mini-stories are unfathomably linked by weed, money and two rare, expensive shotguns. Not the kind of story you hear on a daily basis. Every thug, youth, gangster and pot-head gets equal screen-time. Four Londoners bite off more than they can chew; Eddy (Moran) owes some serious dollar to gangster/porn shop owner Hatchet Harry (Moriarty) after losing in a poker-style card game. Tom (Flemyng), Soap (Fletcher), Bacon (Statham) and Eddy have 500k to find in a week, or they're dead-meat. Their plan? Snatch money from drug dealers who plan to snatch money from drug dealers. Who's involved? An ex-footballer who pulls off thug-life considerably well (Vinnie Jones), a real life bare-knuckle fighter (Lenny McLean), a Russian with anger issues and a couple of naive Scousers that spearhead every scene they're in. The conclusion is catastrophic but highly engrossing; Lock, Stock's black comedy hits all the funny bones in the right places, even with its mildly haphazard narrative. This film is a defining British classic, with an ending more sensational than The Italian Job.",8,1,1,5 June 2015
The Godfather: Part III," Lacks the intensity part I and II have, but still not bad as a stand alone film.
","The Godfather: Part III takes place many years after Part II. Al Pacino's Michael Corleone a.k.a The Godfather is older, wiser and better than before. His nephew Vincent (Andy Garcia), who he takes under his wing, is irrational and short-tempered, just like his father (Sonny Corleone, as played by James Caan in Part I). Part III sees Michael trying to correct the wrongs and wipe away his sins. III should've been filmed shortly after II. Time has sapped The Godfather's intensity. Pacino and Garcia are on top form. This film's success is partly down to the others. A fine film in its own right but one that will never reach the heights of its predecessors.",8,0,1,10 December 2015
The Holiday," Totally gushy, but a delight to watch.
","The Holiday is a romantic-comedy that's immensely gushy, with a thick layer of cheese. But that's OK, because it works. Yes it envisages a love that's almost circumstantially impossible. It's absurdness that's at least sweet and warm. Two women, Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet, decide to house-swap for two weeks over the Christmas period. One's in L.A., the other in Surrey (wow, what a comparison). There they meet their retrospective partners. The four main characters, including the charming Jack Black and Jude Law, are very well developed, making it easy to feel their emotions. Regardless of the outcome (and that's easy to grasp from the off), I want things to work out for them. If anything it was nice to see Jack Black in a completely different role to what he's comfortable with, which probably explains why he's so awkward throughout. The Holiday, as much as it's aimed at a certain gender type, can be for all if you just want it to be.",7,1,1,4 January 2016
Steve Jobs," Only Boyle can turn a cold character into an interesting one.
","Steve Jobs is arrogant and often unlikeable. All the money, power and fame obtained over the years of his illustrious career hides what's really behind the CEO of Apple. Jobs' attitude won't win over any hearts. Fassbender, on the other hand, captures the man we know so little about. He's relentless, imitating every habit Jobs carries. Courtesy isn't expected here, but his talent is extremely beguiling.Steve Jobs depicts the moments before three product launches. At these points in time everyone is at his throat. He'd be better off canceling them, to save him the hassle and the drama.Seth Rogan is an unlikely choice as Steve Wozniak, but he adds warmth to a film that's rather cold. Rogan doesn't just look the part, he acts it too. Danny Boyle is one of the best in the biopic/drama genre. Boyle lets the script do the talking (literally). Steve Jobs has his own personal flaws that doesn't reflect in Boyle's filmmaking.",9,8,18,27 November 2015
Pitch Perfect 2," The first is better, the second is funnier.
","Pitch Pertect 2 is actress Elizabeth Bank's first crack at directing, and she's settled in to the role very nicely. Her ability to make us laugh comes naturally; Becca (Kendrick) and the other Barden Bellas are on fine, funny form, starting with Fat Amy's (Wilson) blunder in front of the president. The Bellas' embarrassment has brought them back to square one, and the only way they can get back to the top is by winning the world championships. There's nothing much new on offer here; the music and the singing is just as good as the first, the Bardem Bellas and other competing groups bang out contemporary tunes with ease. In this respect it doesn't quite match its predecessor, but that hardly matters when there's so many memorable, amusing moments. Rebel Wilson steals every scene she's in (again), with help from The Treblemaker's Bumper (Adam DeVine). Other characters have little screen time, including Becca's boyfriend Skylar and the nerdy Benji. Some of the Bellas have become an in-joke (they're basically extras) but some solace can be found in newcomer Emily (Steinfeld). Banks reprises her commentating role alongside John Michael Higgins, only to abuse the Bellas and make a bunch of gags. Pitch Perfect 2 maybe not be as aca-perfect as 2013's outing, but it's sure to appease the fans.",7,6,11,30 May 2015
"Hail, Caesar!"," Hail the Coen Brothers!
","The weird and hugely wonderful Coen Brothers strike again with a movie that's as odd as it is dry. The movie focuses around film studio 'fixer' Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin). Any complication the studio has, he will suppress. Many burdens need tackling on this particular day; a star on their latest blockbuster goes, twin reporters working for different papers harass him, an insufferable actor who lacks talent, and an actress lacking romance. Brolin crosses the tees and dots the eyes, linking all the other film's participants into one erratic comedy. The dialogue flourishes, the farce entertains and the production's a blast to the past, with a few hidden easter eggs to boot.",8,1,2,23 March 2016
Shooter," A surprisingly effective action film.
","Mark Wahlberg's the a bad-ass, cool-ass guy, proving just so in the 2hr duration of Shooter. Antoine Fuqua brings out the best in his chosen actors. Walhberg, for a good third of the film, spends time alone, on the run. Rogue cop Danny Glover and his band of solemn men frame him for murder. Wahlberg escapes, plots revenge and digs around for answers. A rookie FBI agent in the form of Michael Pena believes Wahlberg to be innocent. His naivety's sincere. Both characters have heart, fleshed out by the same goal. Brilliant, undervalued acting and great character exchanges. Shooter is a tight, explosive, and well coordinated. A consistent, must see action film.",8,0,0,11 August 2015
The Terminal," Hanks makes a convincing Russian!
","Anything Tom Hanks touches, turns to gold. The Terminal is yet another hit in his incredible filmography. Spielberg and Hanks have worked together before (SPR, CMIYC). We're definitely in safe hands. Viktor Navorski (Hanks) is a Russian man stuck in limbo. The terminal at JFK, New York becomes his home for the foreseeable future. He's not allowed to enter the country or go back to Russia, due government collapse. Viktor strives off the basics; collecting trolleys for quarters, gathering intel for a man in love and having to deal with the jealous manager Frank (Stanley Tucci). Viktor and Catherine Zeta-Jones's constant traveller fail to spark any believable affection, as time is cut short between them, and their opposites barely attract. Hanks is a class beyond reach, but a harmless story doesn't grant him space to bloom.",7,0,1,24 February 2016
Despicable Me," What's not to love?
","What's not to love about Despicable Me? There's Gru (Carell), the evil villain being ousted by another evil villain. He revels in others misfortunes, which is sadistically just as funny for us. There's also the three adorable sisters who're fostered by Gru, who distract him from his evil plans. And lastly, the minions. Oh, the minions! Millions of small, yellow, goggle-eyed minions. They are what make Despicable Me such a sensation. Just like the little sisters, the minions are lovable and funny. Universal's animation has captured the hearts of many with great originality. This is a cartoon movie with plenty to like for all ages.",9,0,0,28 June 2015
Iron Man," Downey Jr. wows as Stark, and the rest falls in to place around him.
","Robert Downey Jr. is more than fitting as the rich, intelligent, swagger-man Tony Stark. Iron Man is just a suit, so Tony is just a person. He's not a superhero, he's a man thriving in decadence, an entrepreneur with personal gain. His business, Stark Industries, manufactures and sells weapons for war. It takes his kidnapping and subsequent three month imprisonment to realise the wrongs in his life. The suits helps him right his wrongs. Obadiah Stane, work partner and friend of Tony's Father, is against Tony's decisions. With his shiny, bald head, Bridges is a brooding, intimidating figure, taking some of that huge burden laid upon Downey to do so well. The finest aspect for me (and some may disagree) is director Jon Favreau's spends more time with the man than the suit. It's about the characters, and it pays to see some real heart in a Hollywood blockbuster.",8,0,1,26 March 2016
X2: X-Men United," Finally a sequel that outdoes the first!
","X-Men 2 surpasses X-Men. And sequels never usually do. Bryan Singer has royally upped his game, with a bigger budget, astonishingly in-depth mutants (old and new) and a story thick with layers. Starting fiercely with a mutant attacking the Whitehouse, X2 focuses on Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and his hazy past with military man William Stryker (Brian Cox), who's now against all mutants after the scare in Washington. The mutant/human divide is constantly marred in various ways. The young Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) struggles to maintain a relationship with the familiar faced Rogue (Anna Paquin). He also has to contend with his family discovering his secret. Mystique (Romijn) breaks out Magneto (McKellen) to form an uneasy alliance with the X-Men, and stand against the opposing government and their new anti-mutant laws. All sub- plots are equally distributed. There's a huge amount to process in 134 minutes, with Singer and writing partners David Hayter and Zak Penn creating a superhero sequel others should inspire to be. Now for the grand finale.",8,0,0,29 February 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Incredible stuff, even though it's in familiar territory.
","After a really long decade Star Wars is back! J.J. Abrams has done us proud. The Force Awakens, or episode VII (the first in a new trilogy of films to come every other year) as it's been named, is a superb science-fiction film. For the die-hard fans its only gripe is it's a little too familiar in territory, but that's genuinely it. For the newer, younger audiences, TFA leads a path to what's to come. When the blue letters 'A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away' followed by the trademark yellow words swiping up the starry backdrop, I felt like I was 11 again. There's a strong scent of nostalgia mixed in to the story, but for every old memory there's 10 new ones. So many emotions washed through me within a short space of time, as I know my expectations (and everyone else's) are, and were, going to be met. It only takes a few seconds to know we're in the capable hands of someone who's a major fan himself.Now briefly on to what he's given us. The light side hangs in the balance. The forces of darkness, now known as the First Order, are stronger, bigger, more formidable than ever before. Characters on either side are equal throughout. TFA opens up the SW universe. Jakku's desert looks splendid, derelict AT-AT walkers and Star Destroyers are left abandoned and new arrivals provide different personalities that I want to know so much more about. Adam Driver's Kylo Ren switches from intimidating foe to deeply torn adolescent. All five main newbies (Isaac's fighter pilot Poe, Ridley's feisty girl Ray, Boyega's runaway Fin, Gleeson's evil man Snoke and Driver's Sith) get there chance to shine, just as the older ones so dear to me do as well. I'm eager to see The Force Awakens again, and even more for the next chapter. Episode VII will keep me feeling happy and young for a long time after its release. Next up, a spin-off called Rogue One!",9,13,44,21 December 2015
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The (nearly) flawless trilogy comes to an end.
","In the epic conclusion of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, The Return of the King sees Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), well, return as the king. Him and his allies attempt to draw out the orcs that surround Mt. Doom, so Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) can destroy the One Ring. The last installment upholds the other film's themes, values and reputations. The battle on Pelennor Fields outdoes Helm's Deep's in scope and scale. The film's tone and feel is darker. Brutal enemies lurk the lands, dark and dank locations drain all hope and fills me with despair. The odds are heavily stacked against the remaining Fellowship. Howard Shore's score is just as beautiful and emotional as it's ever been. The Return of the King's art and design is intricate work, with incredibly detailed locations and costumes. J.R.R Tolkien would be proud of the coming to life of his book. Not even the long, drawn-out ending can hurt this flawless, incomparable trilogy.",10,0,1,3 February 2016
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Nothing short of spectacular.
","Star Wars: the ultimate science fiction. The go to franchise. A New Hope is where it all started. George Lucas labeled his first outing as the fourth episode, holding the start of the story until a later date. For 22 years though, we're with Luke Skywalker (Hamill), a youngster keen on joining the Rebel alliance, teams up with Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi (Guinness), a couple of droids (R2-D2 and C3PO) and rough outlaws (Harrison Ford's Han Solo and Peter Mayhew's Chewbacca) to save princess Leia (Fisher) from the clutches of the evil Empire and destroy their battle station, the Death Star. A New Hope is groundbreaking, both in genre and visual effects. It represents the forces of good vs. evil perfectly. Luke's the guy we all want to be, whilst the Sith Lord Darth Vader intimidates with voice, presence and action. Leia and Han show glints of romance that hints at more to come. ANH is an all round great film in a world that encompasses unlimited possibilities. It's more of a need to see than a want.",10,0,1,27 October 2015
What We Do in the Shadows," Just a brilliant documentary-comedy.
","f you like Flight of the Conchords then you'll love What We Do in the Shadows. It's a parody documentary that follows the lives of a group of vampires living in Wellington, New Zealand. They each get to tell their story, including their illustrious backgrounds, hitting the city streets, trying to get in to nightclubs, who should do the dishes and confrontations with Wolves. Every character has different background, from Ben Fransham's Nosferatu and Jemaine Clement's goth, to Twilight-esque Deacon and newcomer (and general conflict maker) Nick. This is funny, even when it's not trying to be. Dryer than your everyday comedy, but never decreasing in momentum. FotC's regular Rhys Darby is an absolute scene stealer. A comedy following the lives of the werewolves should be next on their list.",9,1,3,9 November 2015
Deadpool," Hilarious anarchy!
","I bet 20th Century Fox are kicking themselves that they didn't take Deadpool off the shelf sooner. Big thanks should go to Ryan Reynolds for sticking with it since X-Men Origins: Wolverine. He reprises the role as Wade Wilson (which was considerably underused in Origins) running free in the new Marvel expedition. Profanity follows even cruder profanity, as Wade, or Deadpool, pulls us into a kamikaze of nonchalance and amusement. Rather than follow the same formula as other Marvels, Deadpool starts near the end, backtracking to parts of Wade's life that eventually brings us up to speed. Without the humour, Deadpool would lightly suffer, and blend in with other superhero movies (origin, save the girl, final showdown). Its comedy outweighs its action, but when the action comes round, it flourishes. Deadpool is at its most beautiful and crass when Wade 'breaks the fourth wall', mocking everything these types of films set out to be. The title credits alone let you know what you're in for. And don't forget that end credit scene!",8,1,10,23 February 2016
Jackie Brown," Jackie Brown lacks the cool edge that RD and PF have.
","Jackie Brown is Quentin Tarantino's third feature length film, and the only one is his roster that's not an original screenplay. And this is why, in my opinion, it's his least- best work. It's still a solid piece of work, but by filming an adaption Tarantino doesn't get the chance to break free like he's done with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. JB contains only fleeting moments of absurdity and outrageousness, toned down as if to keep the director in check. Jackie (Pam Grier) an air hostess, is forced to smuggle money from Mexico to L.A by the unconvincing weapons dealer Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson). Betrayal and double crossings ensue. Agent Nicolette (Michael Keaton) is on her case. Others involved include a bail bonds accountant (Robert Forster) and a couple of Ordell's friends (Robert De Niro and Bridget Fonda). A good hour could be cut from the 154 minute running time to make it quick, snappy and enthralling. Instead it drags in the 2nd act, and by that time, I had to pause, and split Jackie Brown in to parts. Of all of Tarantino's films, this is one I won't be rushing back to.",6,0,3,31 January 2016
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Better than the first?
","The Empire Strikes Back does not suffer from 'middle film syndrome'. It greatly enhances the Star Wars universe. Luke Skywalker's (Hamill) adventures take us to the ice planet Hoth, where the Rebels are hiding from the Imperials. They're eventually rooted out by Darth Vader and his army. Luke, Leia (Fisher) and Han (Ford) and the droids make their escape, the former heading to Dagobah for Jedi training, whilst the others seek help from an old friend. TESB is full of blistering action; the battle of Hoth, with the AT-AT walkers and Luke's first Jedi experiences making the back of the neck tingle. A now heightened romance between Han and Leia plays out to stunning effect. New characters are introduced, but only a few so that Empire never detracts from the main trio. Then there's the twist. If you don't know about it then you should, otherwise start watching Star Wars now. There's no need to be a fan of science fiction, just excellent entertainment.",10,1,2,27 October 2015
The Cabin in the Woods," Insane, just insane.
","I'm not sure where to begin with The Cabin in the Woods without giving too much away. This will be brief and probably not very helpful, but this films needs to be seen with as little known about it as possible. Five friends go on vacation to a... yes you named it... cabin in the woods. They're overseen by two office workers, Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford, from an underground-lab. What beholds the holiday- goers? Words cannot describe. Drew Goddard pumps out cliché after cliché, only to slap us in the face with outrageousness. This is unique, gory and funny, thanks to Joss Whedon's writing skills. Watch this, but be warned, you will never be prepared.",8,0,2,5 November 2015
Spectre," Brings in fans old and new without disturbing the memories of old.
","Skyfall changed the way we saw Jame Bond. The gadgets were stripped, cheesy one- liners thrown out the window, and a light hearted attitude was pushed aside for serious one. Craig's Bond means business, especially when things were personal. Spectre follows this by being an indirect sequel to Casino Royale, Quantum and Skyfall. It ties up ends that don't necessarily need tying up. If, like me, you love a bit of nostalgia in movies, you'll point out things and get overly excited. True Bond fans will be wanting more, but need not fear, Spectre's on par with its predecessor, just for different reasons. The opening scene is phenomenal. We follow a couple walking their way through the streets in Mexico City during Day of the Dead. Surely the most technical shot should be saved for last. Craig is on top form, Christoph Waltz's villain matching him blow by blow. Dave Bautista's henchman, similar to Goldfinger's Oddjob, is underused, whilst the Bond girls achieve what they always achieve. Q (Wishaw) walks as much as he talks, and Judi Dench is barely missed as Fiennes' M looks right at home with a sub-plot of his own. For every classic Bond forte there's a lack of another, or an under-usage of it. Time is still shaping James Bond. 24 films in and he's still full of surprises, just as Spectre has its own, assuming all forms of media have been avoided in your life.",8,11,22,25 November 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Absolutely stunning cinema.
","Mad Max: Fury Road is a visually stunning masterpiece by George Miller. It's been 30 years since Miller's last project: the last of the original Mad Max films, starring Mel Gibson. Comparisons cannot be made as I've yet to watch them. There are no excuses. Max's crazy adventure may not take him very far, but the world in which he resides is imaginative. The vast wasteland surrounding small territories show how bleak everything has become. Water is sparse and saved for the main cretin and his crew. Weird, cult-like followers, with their bald heads, white painted bodies and addiction to silvery substance, follow his orders. There's no sign of any nature, only a rumour of a place populated by trees and running water. Theron's barbaric-looking Furiosa, with her metal arm and gigantic tanker, thwarts her bosses' orders and steals that which is most precious to him. Immortan Joe (Keays-Byrne) gathers his whole force in pursuit. What emanates is a fantastically frenzied chase across the desert. MM:FR is full of insane car chases (the cars are a sight to behold in themselves), incredible explosions and well thought-out action. The 3D isn't necessary; only one part stands out in particular and the story is only strong enough to keep the action expressive. Max (Hardy), with his gruff voice and limited dialogue, is secondary to Furiosa. His serenity and coldness towards others makes him the perfect character to explore. Flashes of his family, from a world once known, haunt him constantly. Mad Max: Fury Road isn't just creative and captivating to the very end, it sets up potential for expansion. After this ride, it'd be criminal for the film studio not to.",10,19,40,27 May 2015
Macbeth," This Macbeth is a Shakespeare adaption at its best, if you can get past the dialogue.
","William Shakespeare's style of writing, whether its reading chapters in his books, or listening to dialogue in the umpteenth telling of Macbeth, makes me feel stupid. Thankfully the story of Macbeth has been told plenty enough times to understand what's going on, and everyone in this 2015 telling more than make up for its insolence. The story as a whole is dark, horrifying and wicked. Macbeth, played by the impeccably flawed Fassbender, loses the plot when his wife, the sinister, manipulative Marion Cotillard, pushes him to kill the king of Scotland (David Thewlis). There's one battle Macbeth cannot win, and that's against the demons (or witches, in this case) that continually torment him. There are hints of Game of Thrones and The Lord of the Rings in there, dappling into the realms of fantasy through the eyes of Macbeth. This is gritty, dark stuff from director Justin Kerzel, a Shakespeare adaption that's not as hard to digest as originally thought.",8,2,3,31 January 2016
The Martian," The Martian
","First Saving Private Ryan, then Interstellar, and now The Martian. Matt Damon's the one to find. The go to guy. The one worthy of being found thrice over. Damon is Watney, a man stranded on Mars after his crew believe him dead. This film is about his survival. Suspension of disbelief is steady and highly believable, to the point of utter astonishment. It's incredible how Watney's time spent on Mars feels so real. No one has landed on Mars before, and no one probably will in our lifetime. Ridley Scott and the team behind The Martian have kept the physics clean. Watney painfully produces food and water for the long haul. Damon is mesmerising. Open spaces and long/wide angle shots create a feeling of solitude. He's supported by the likes of Sean Bean and Chiwetel Ejiofor, but when the screen's off Damon, it needs to be. We need to know how and what he's doing. Visually stunning effects add a balance of beauty and ambiance. The contrast is definitely felt between Watney on Mars, his crew on their ship back home and the NASA workers on Earth. The Martian is a gripping blockbuster, even if it's a wee bit predictable.",9,8,18,12 October 2015
Furious 7," The biggest and loudest one yet.
","Fast & Furious 7, or just Furious 7 as it's known in the US, is a fitting, endearing tribute to the late Paul Walker. Universal studios have taken the right path in his memory. Films 1-4 were all about the cars and the family, 5 and 6 upped the amp, focusing on the action whilst still holding a substantial plot. 7 follows the latter, resulting in the loudest, gutsiest ride yet. Dominic Toretto (Diesel) and his 'family' have crossed the wrong criminal. Derckard Shaw (Statham), brother of Owen Shaw (Luke Evans), want revenge on those who've put his brother in hospital. Toretto and the gang receive help from a government operation led by Kurt Russell. They cross countries performing some of the biggest feats in stunt history; some thoroughly believable, others highly ludicrous. You've come to the wrong place if you want an intricate plot, but if you want an action packed thrill-of-a-ride, look no further. It's funny, it's bold and the cast smash it with their various personalities. The big question is, how will they handle F&F8?

The Godfather," One of the greats, if not the great.
","There isn't a gangster film out there bigger or better than The Godfather. It's hard to some it up in a few words, but here goes. At the centre of this film is the family. The Corleone family, headed by Vito (Marlon Brando), a.k.a. The Don, or The Godfather. His daughter's wedding tells us all we need to know about the Corleone's; key individuals, small but incredibly thought out sub-plots and a running theme of business and personal matters never mix. The Godfather is based on the simplest of foundations. Love thy family. Think before you act. Never betray your own. Vito attempts to keep the peace between the crime families. When things go south Vito's youngest son Michael (Al Pacino) gets involved. Michael's innocence is torn apart as he takes control of the family business.With every view comes a new discovery, a piece of the puzzle missed the last time round. The Godfather is a labyrinth waiting to be deciphered. Brando is sublime. He's able to radiate warmth and coercion with the smallest of reactions. It sets up careers for James Caan and Robert Duvall, who're brothers with dissimilar attitudes. The best is to come for Pacino, as this first part in a trilogy only shows his potential. The Godfather is a one of the most intense gangsters films you're ever likely to see.",10,6,10,6 December 2015
