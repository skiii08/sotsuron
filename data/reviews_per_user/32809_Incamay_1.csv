3:10 to Yuma," Wow!
","After reading some of these reviews I was pretty amped up to see this movie. I can now say this has got to go down as the most over hyped move I have ever seen. It wasn't even close to what I would call a good movie. As others here have said there is just way to much that doesn't even make sense. I just love the part with the Apache that just open fire with no reason at all. Hmmm don't you think they would of waited until they had them with a better shot. I don't even think the acting was as great as some of you are saying. It was OK but nothing great because the characters have no depth at all. This movie is no up there with Scarface on the list of most over hyped, over rated movies of all time. Don't even waste your money to rent it... If you want to see a great western check out Tombstone trust me.",1,7,13,9 January 2008
