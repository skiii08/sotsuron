Blade Runner 2049," A worthy successor
","Great film. Looks amazing with lots of touches relating back to the original film. Definitely worth seeing in the cinema on a big screen, although I'm a bit deaf after being blasted by the bass sounds. We saw the two-D version on the basis it is a long film to watch in three-D.Still looked amazing. Good acting, good story, nice twists, great action scenes, didn't follow the same plot as the first one. Some very nice touches over that nature of how technology is going, particularly AI. Best film of the year - definitely, better than the original? Well I need to see it a few time before I make that decision. Oh and watch the first one first, my granddaughter didn't and got rather lost in the plot.",10,1,10,9 October 2017
Star Trek Into Darkness," Good but just missed being perfect
","I have been fan of the original series since they first came out; I have loved the idea behind the reboot. I have loved all the actors and actresses in the series, and in this film the production values, CGI, and prop details are superb, in fact flawless. Sit back and enjoy the ride, it's great (don't read the spoilers).Spoiler Alert. So it could have been the best film of the year, could have been the best Star Film; but it isn't. So what lets it down? Stupid stuff really, and so fixable. Basically, the script, OK so you can get away with Khan being a bit of the reservation - but the Admiral? Star Fleet finest suddenly come down with a case of mass murder, and trying to blow up Star Fleet's flag ship (before a war). So Khan on a mission to avenge his (believe to him) dead crew, would not zip off to Kronus with the job half done. Unfortunately, the script is littered with ill thought out plot devices. Pace is also an issue, my wife actually fell asleep during some of the set action pieces. Mostly the action pieces are brilliant, but there are a few too long, and the odd bit that is too hurried. I enjoyed it, my wife didn't, and that always means they have failed to engage non-fans that like action movies. But it annoys me that little things have let down all the actors, actress, camera, music, CGI set design etc. because you cannot criticize, the look, feel, and epic-ness of the Star Trek world. So next film, for God sake give a bunch of really critical Star Trek fans the plot and let them rip it to bits before you star shooting. It will be the film your really deserve to make - and we want to see.",9,3,8,1 June 2013
