Scarface," I always tell the truth, even when I lie.
","I admit it I want to be Tony, I mean...doesn't everybody? He's got the pretty girl, the pretty money and the not so pretty power but failing that I am happy to run around and start my cocaine empire from the safe confines of a Scarface video game. Al Pacino's Tony Mantana has over years,transcended all areas of pop culture and multi media and if he was still alive, in his famous Cuban accent he would be declaring 'I was a f*&ken icon then and I'm a f*&ken icon now' 226 F-Bombs in that film...thats why I originally wanted to watch it all those years ago sitting in that big house with my excited friends. Scarface, directed by Blow Out's Brian De Palma premiered in New York, December 1. 1983 to mixed reactions. The had been warning signs and gossip regarding the excessive violence through out the production but the sophisticated crowd were certainly not ready for such confronting images especially with Miami such a hotbed for on going violence with Escobar's drug gangs. Brian and producer Marty Bregman had submitted an original cut of Scarface and had garnished themselves a dreaded X rating from the censorship board. After a few edits they resubmitted but the board would not budge. Finally after intense negotiations Brian was able to release the film with an R rating allowing it to open in more cinemas for a hopefully bigger return. Scarface bombed. It wasn't Oliver Stone's script, It wasn't the actors and it wasn't the production values... it was just that no one was ready for such a movie. People still liked there Mob films to have class like Coppola's Godfather trilogy, up to number two at the time. People didn't want to see bodies in the street and blood on the walls, they could see these things on the news every night. The Godfather is an amazing movie no doubt but The story of Cuban immigrant Antonio Montana is the closest to the truth of what was going on in Miami and South America at the time. Al Pacino finished his most important decade with this film. He had been Marty Bregmans boy with his sensitive portrayal of Sonny in Dog Day Afternoon. The seventies had established him as a monumental talent but his career would suffer slightly because of Scarface and another harrowing film, Cruising...the gay hustler shocker. This film was crucified more than Scarface both critically and commercially. Why Pacino wanted to do two of the most controversial films of all time back to back is beyond me and it is said that his alcoholism was in full swing after these two films if not slightly before. Fast forward twenty years and Scarface has made back it's investment and trippled the profit. It's the same script, the same production and the same actors it's that the viewing audience has changed. Young up and coming savvy minded men have adopted Scarface as there own and are making millions off Mr Montanas strict business codes. People like Snoop Dogg, Sean Combs and other high level members of Hip Hop have been claiming for ages that Scarface was under appreciated. This word of mouth by some of Americas biggest entrepreneurs allowed Brian De Palma, Marty Bregman and Al Pacino to finally sweep the ghosts away. Scarface is an amazing film. I would hope there are easier ways to claim the American dream but as pure spectacle you can't find a better story of rags to riches that this. A film that suffered at the box office all those years ago but went on to make money with a more accepting generation at more accepting time. Live on Mr Montana, it only gets better from here.",Null,3,6,14 September 2011
It," January Embers
","Stephen King adaptations can be a mixed bag. For every masterpiece, A Shawshank Redemption and The Shining there are other productions that sit opposite, CELL, Bag of Bones and the deplorable Mist TV series to name a few. King has a huge body of work and some times it takes a film director to make or break his writing for a cinematic audience.Andy Muschietti and screenwriter Cary Fukunaga announced a cinema version of IT in 2014. Muschietti had directed MAMA and Fukunaga had gone into bat for Woody Harrelson and Matt Mcconaughey for the first season of True Detective. It was an interesting peering and then the production went quiet. until the first trailer.Based on the the Novel by King and the television version which featured Tim Curry as the clown antagonist obsessed with killing children the question was; would the trailer that broke the internet match up to everything read and seen before? and if so would it be better?After two full versions Andy Muschietti had a lot of work to do.Bill, Ben , Beverley, Richie, Mike, Eddie and Stanley live in the fictional town Derry Maine. They are all very early teenagers and find comfort among each other and are very close. Early on Bill loses his brother and it soon becomes obvious that Derry houses a demon so evil that adults cannot see it leaving it to the teens to do something about it. This is a very Stephen King story.After a relentless death that will go down in the halls of Horror as a great film murder. This becomes a very adult version of the story compared to the mini series but not so the novel which is even more adult. Stephen King WTF !!. The Clown PENNYWISE is pivotal early and Bill Skisgard is owning it in the first few seconds which is important not just for the story but also the cinematography sound and general tension.Muschietti has done an amazing job. Stephen King has mentioned he did not expect this to be as good as it is and he is right. This is a fantastic horror film but in saying it pays homage to the classic 80's and also addresses the issues of teens growing up ( Well almost ) and creates an on screen entity that future films other that the sequel will struggle to compete with.PENNYWISE is not nice, Hannibal Lecter not nice.A film that has had the highest opening of any horror film ever and it deserves this, We deserve it , This is the mini series on steroids and fills the gap between the three. Smart acting directing and writing for a simple horror film which has fallen into very caring hands.Bring on Chapter 2...It's going to get very nasty.",9,7,13,16 September 2017
The Exorcist," A Re-Visit.
","On returning to The Exorcist, the question is does it stand up to the test of time and to some degree was it a masterpiece in1973 the year of its release? I watched the extended cut in 1999 as I was to young to see the original at the cinema. I was stuck by the cinematography, sound and the acting of Ellen Burstyn, Max Von Sydow, Jason Miller and a very young Linda Blair. It combined to make a wonderful if not disturbing experience. With the enhanced visuals and sound it found it's true place. Last night I unwrapped the Blue-Ray version and settled in to watch it on a recently purchased 4 K television. It was an amazing experience.One of the best in cinema for me.This version enhances the picture and sound from its DVD counterpart and as director William Friedkin has mentioned there is more 'sounds' not just better sound. This is truly the scariest film of all time, By the third act I felt savaged. I saw things I missed from the DVD, one particular image will haunt me forever as I am sure it will others.The Exorcist is based on the highly successful novel written by William Peter Blatty. It tells the story of Chris McNeil a successful actor in Washington DC where she resides in an upmarket rental property in Georgetown with her daughter Regan. Over three weeks 12 year old Regan attracts the attention of an evil entity. Chris can only watch hopelessly as her daughter succumbs to its sinister advances leading them all into horrible form of Hell.A tale told with hyper realism and masterfully directed. A story of lost faith, confused science and family trauma. We are lucky to live in a time of technology and anyone who has watched The Exorcist over the years you need to see this version. In 1973 this was designed for Blue-Ray. The Masterpiece just didn't know it.One of the greatest films ever made and now on its best platform.Watch out for Latin women.",10,2,3,2 December 2016
Drive," The strong silent type.
","This is quite special, If Hugh Jackman and The Descent's director Neil Marshall had been involved then we would have had a much different film, in fact much less of a film. Not to say that Hugh and Neil can't do their jobs but the team of Ryan Gosling and Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn threw the idea of a Fast and furious clone out the car window in favor of a something very special and the most enjoyable film I have watched since Eastern promises.Refn fresh with moderate success with The Tom Hardy venture Bronson sat in a car driving through LA with Ryan Gosling. Ryan, passionate about the screenplay from Hossein Amini based on the book written by James Sallis wanted a different take on the popular 'Driving' genre and had seen Bronson and knew that he wanted Refn on board. Refn thought about it and before he was dropped at his rented Townhouse he said yes to Ryan Gosling.Driver, his name is a stunt artist for the Hollywood community under careful management from Shannon, Breaking Bad's Bryan Cranston. He makes a little money but by night Shannon organizes Drivers talented career into a get away driver for any and all who are prepared to pay. It is all fine but as Shannon seems uncomfortable about exactly how much money he makes he asks Mob partner Bernie Rose (This years Oscar recipient for best supporting actor Albert Brooks) for a cash advance on a stock car that Driver will take through the local shows and Shannon will probably be able to retire.Everything is fine until Driver meets his neighbors Irene and her young son Bonicio,a family with their husband and father in prison. Driver falls for her but more so the family environment and of course by the time Standard ( an excellent Oscar Issac)finally gets out, then the dynamic changes and we are set for a much different second half. Standard has bought his demons from prison.A simple story but in the hands of all the players especially the director and cinematographer we are thrown into a world that glistens in pink neon noir with a soundtrack mixed with electro-pop. THe streets mold and contort as does the leads...Ryan Gosling plays all the soft sides of Brando and does one of the his bravest performances yet, the same can be said for Carey Mulligan a young mother trying to hold it together. These two were born to play opposite each other. Even the minor actors leave a mark as this wonderful journey leads to a harrowing nightmare.For me it is Refn, He is a genius in pace, visuals and lighting and what he gave us last year brings hope for other young Directors wanted to break an established formula. Drive bombed on its opening weekend as it went up against crowd favorite The Lion King 3D...It has now made four times it initial investment of twelve million making it an artistic success thanks to word of mouth from a all of us.As I said, not a film really but an experience and an emotion and something that gives faith to the fact that A Hero can be a real human being too, amazing stuff.",10,2,5,1 January 2012
