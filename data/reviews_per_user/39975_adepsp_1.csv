The Incredible Hulk," Much better than you might think
","I really liked it... It was better than I expected (which isn't asking much after the last movie version)...If you've seen Iron man recently then you'll probably prefer that but this film does a lot to redeem the hulk as a respect worthy comic book character in film format.I look forward to the obvious sequel...!!It appears I need 10 lines to get this comment posted so I'll suggest you review my YouTube account RodHullIAmHim and watch the Michael More interview with Stewart Lee as I believe the Hulk is mentioned and maybe it's time to see a Swamp Thing film for the same reasons this film was made...? i.e. they were all rubbish before so let's make a good one...Basically, this is a good one, don't pay too much but you'll probably enjoy it anyway...I liked it.",4,2,6,18 June 2008
