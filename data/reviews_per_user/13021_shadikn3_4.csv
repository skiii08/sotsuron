Conquest 1453," I enjoyed the move
",They did good as foreign film.Just wished i spoke the language so i didn't have to read subtitles.Pretty cool to see movies outside of the Trojan Horse and stuff like that.Cool.This one was about the Ottoman's and their heroism.Special effects aren't as good as US movies but i didn't care too much.Was more into the story line and characters.English Dub probably would sound cheesy but i made it through the whole movie.Anyone that puts this movie down is probably because they have a problem with the people.But the people did a good job with the movie.Thanks.,7,4,10,15 November 2012
It," Hmmmm
","I don't see what everyone see's in this movie. It just kind of happens and your like OK no ones running to parents. SmhIt's not as great as it looks or it's rated. I found myself falling asleep to it. Wen to watch it during the day too. So.....yea.Um, idk. I can't even remember any good parts to it. I'm going to have to watch the old it. I'm wondering how much or which one is closer to the book. Nope. I haven't read it.I guess it's scary if you hate clowns. To me it was kind of like Freddy Kruger meets the Goonies with Bozo the Clown on Meth with a satanic twist. It should've been more remote if it was just going to be about the kids.That's all i gotta say. Sorry guys. I wasted my money.This could've been on FX channel or Scifi.",5,0,5,23 September 2017
Oblivion," Hmmmm
",Bad : It's kind of slow. Also it's a big world and not enough going on it. I fell asleep 3 times before i could watch the whole thing completely.Good: It has enough story to be interesting and confusing. Then it answers the questions for ya over time.It has a flip to it. I think if you like sci-fi you will like this one. Check it out. I still own this movie. I just got rid of tons of movies the other day. I'm hoping they come out with a part 2. I'm just wondering. Can't say way though. I'm not sure if this is spoiler. I'm just trying to get my review to go through.,8,2,3,30 August 2013
It Follows," The STD follows.
","Man i was so excited when i got the movie and seen that it was rated 7 stars on IMDb. Pssssh. This movie was like saying Bloody Mary in the mirror. Dumb. People are lying rating this any higher then a 4. Oh wait. I give it a 4, but i give the score 10. I think that's why it has 7 ranking. Music is amazingly twisted. Movie is like yea right. OK OK OK OK, really? Ahh man, Sigh. Need a say more. Pretty actress's. lol This is some junior high movie. You gotta be young to really be naive to this. Next.I'm looking for a real thrill.I love the movie I saw the devil and Chaser. They were for more better then this one.",4,6,45,3 June 2015
