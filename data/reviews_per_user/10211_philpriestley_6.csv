Walk the Line," Good but unfaithful
","Let me get this right out there - I am a Johnny Cash fan. So there are two aspects of this movie that are important to me: 1) Is it a faithful biopic about the man? 2) Is it a good entertaining movie? Look - I can live with this film as a great movie that tells a compelling story. The performances by the two leads are absolutely credible and at times they just blow you away.I really enjoyed this film. It is dark in parts, it does a good job at hinting at the wild man in Johnny Cash without turning him into a villain or anything, and June Carter Cash is portrayed as just a wonderful woman (and I am sure that she was).However - you do have to understand that there is artistic license here to make this stuff fit for cinema.The film is relentlessly unfair to Johnny Cash's first wife. Vivian (his first wife) has been described as devoted to her husband, supportive of his music, and faithful throughout their time together. She was with Johnny throughout all the hard times of financial struggle, they had two kids together, and according to most sources they had a loving happy marriage. Had Cash not become the icon and the star that he did, that marriage probably would've held firm. In the film Vivian is portrayed as a woman who is never happy, who nags her husband for more, as possessive, as jealous and materialistic. It also suggests that Vivian criticised Johnny's music, undermined him, and tore down his dream.In reality Vivian was supportive, hardworking, loyal and celebrated his love of music. I think Johnny Cash would be the first person to say that his own behaviour, his fame, his abuse of drugs, his time on the road, and his infidelity were unfair on Vivian.Johnny Cash and Vivian Cash were married 12 years before they divorced, although it seems that this film trivialises that and just wants to treat her as a mistake that happened before June Carter arrived.Let's be perfectly honest here June Carter really struggled with her conscience when it came to loving Johnny Cash. When they got together he was a very bad man - a drug addict, and a man with a wild and unpredictable temper. He got banned from the Grand Ole' Opry for smashing all the footlights. June herself was a married woman (twice previously) and having a religious background wrote 'Ring of Fire' to express how she felt about Cash - she thought she was going to hell.I'm pretty sure that Johnny Cash would have portrayed either his relationship with Vivian nor his relationship with June in such a lopsided way. Nor do I think that Cash would've portrayed himself as such a victim when it came to the drugs.Other scenes are made to fit the mood and the mojo of the film. For example when Cash saw Sam Phillips for the first time at Sun Records he didn't get signed and they didn't make a record.Phillips did warn Cash off gospel music (saying that he couldn't sell it) but Cash certainly didn't play 'Folsom Prison Blues' to him. The track that caught Sam's attention was the far less incendiary (and more duke box friendly) 'Hey Porter'.When Phillips did hear 'Folsom Prison Blues' he wasn't convinced by it immediately and didn't really look at putting it out until 'Cry Cry Cry' was done.What the film doesn't really reflect is that Cash didn't just write those dark moody tracks - he wrote chart friendly commercial stuff too, like 'Get Rhythm' and so on.You get the idea.Anyway - it's a superb film, even if it isn't a completely sincere telling of the story.",7,1,2,6 August 2015
Darkest Hour," A decent but lightweight film
","There is a terrible truth about Winston Churchill. He wasn't a cuddly cigar chomping Grandad to the masses - he was an old school blue blooded Empire man with fiercely racist views, little empathy for the working classes, and a readiness to use chemical weapons.Winston invested a good deal of time and money exploring Anthrax and toyed with the idea of dumping it in Germany.Instead we are painfully served a version of Churchill exploring the subway and crying in front of a child.Make no mistake - Churchill was the monster we needed right then - but he was a monster. Unsurprisingly this is not conveyed on any level in this beige political expediency.Performance from Gary Oldman is superb as the man the post modern Britain has claimed Churchill to be. Everyone else is meh.If you can separate the fact from fiction this not unforgiveable and quite watchable. There is nothing here that will upset children either.",4,4,6,10 November 2018
The Expendables," So bad I'm even wasting my time writing a review
","This could be slammed quite genuinely as just a terrible, mindless action flick. That would be enough. That being said you might reasonably turn around and accuse me of being a film snob. There is a place for action movies etc.OK. Fine. Yes there is a place for action movies. There are some great actions movies out there. Just trust me on this one - The Expendables is not one of them.There is so much of this film that is about ego. Each of the characters (as crappy and wafer thin as those characters are) has to maintain a macho presence that is agreeable to the dreadful, should be dead, movie actor playing them.The scene with Stallone, Arnie and Willis is cringe-worthy.It all gets in the way of the film. What film there is. There isn't much film to get in the way of.So you're always aware of the different dead beat stars - rather than the characters.The dialogue is purile. The direction is awful. The stunts are actually pretty lame and for a movie that is supposed to be a vehicle for over the top explosive special effects - it is actually quite underwhelming.If you want an enjoyable, over the top, pumped up, steroid filled action experience (and as one man once said - why not?) - you can find much better out there. This is just a terrible, terrible movie. So avoid it.",2,1,3,30 May 2015
The Holiday," Love Actually re-write goes wrong
","Ensemble cast is brought together to basically work a shameless rejig of Love Actually. It doesn't step out of the formula of any romcom you've seen before.Generally - start from this point - it's a genre that is crap unless the dialogue is really sharp. You're dealing with twee sentimentality so something has to make it tolerable. This film lacks any intelligence, it has no edge, there is nothing appealing at all. It is a romcom toilet that indulges every trope. Sadly what is left simply won't flush. There is nothing endearing at all. Perhaps the most irritating part is the transatlantic marketing. It has clearly been written to appeal to the US audiences and the UK audience too. It is hideously false, shallow and clich√©d in this regard. I wonder if the American audiences feel as shafted as the UK audience?Every person on this project got paid too much and should be ashamed they participated. Even the studio tea lady. Hideous. Destroy it with fire.",2,0,3,25 July 2018
Crazy Heart," Garbage
",This film is genuinely poor. Characterisation ranges from cliched to nonexistent. Genuinely.Leading character is the architypal broken down drunk who chain smokes and generally wastes his talents.Romantic lead is inexplicably drawn to said broken down drunk. No back history or logic offered there.Lead has long standing rivalry with another younger more commercially successful performer. Yawn. Too bored to continue. It has no depth. No weight of interest. It operates within a genre without doing anything new or expanding that genre. It's not even derivative because nothing within this film is new. At all. Derivative at least suggests something is new.Jeff Bridges delivers a wildly over hyped performance that shouldn't ever win an Oscar. It is wrong that it won an Oscar. This film is up over seven stars. Want to see something similar but undoubtedly better? Walk the Line.,3,1,3,6 March 2018
Straight Outta Compton," Intense and compelling
","This is a great film. The detail and the effort that been put in here is superb and it's wonderful to see.Each of the actors is well chosen, credible and presents their chosen character in convincing manner.The actors that play Dre and Ice-Cube are particularly compelling, but it seems wrong to overlook the portrayal of Easy-E.This is explosive stuff straight out of the blocks and it never feels slow. It's a long film too, but it keeps you right there. I went to see it in the cinema with my wife and she'd just worked a night shift - she didn't fall asleep and she thought she probably would. That is a pretty good test for a movie.The menacing figure of Shug Knight comes right off the screen too. The drama is both incredible but so real.Laced within this film are real messages too - freedom of speech messages, racial discrimination messages, police brutality messages - which are really important because they were and are part of our times.The big message is though - these five guys came from nowhere, a place where there is less than nothing to share - but with their own gifts, their creativity, their musicality - they left their mark on the world. It just shows that, it's always there waiting to happen, something new and unexpected, out of nowhere. The political elite can't ever stop that, it can't be smothered.This is a great film that holds the torch for the power of creativity and self belief - the ability to over come it all.Final mention - easy to overlook - this film is bringing NWA to a whole new generation who don't know about them. After the film was over I was waiting for my wife (bathroom) and I asked this young guy if he remembered any of the events he'd seen on the screen. He shook his head and said 'No, I'm only 16'.Great film. RIP EASY-E.",8,20,59,29 August 2015
