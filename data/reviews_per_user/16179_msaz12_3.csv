Black Swan," Wow. Just Wow
","I always found the story of the Swan Lake a bit boring. It's a typical princess story with a sad ending. I even remember watching an animated version of this story and couldn't care less. It didn't enjoy the popularity of the other princess stories like Little Mermaid or Mulan.However, when I saw this movie as portrayed by Natalie Portman, I was blown away. Never before had I seen such a gritty, scandalous version. This isn't your little girl fairytale anymore. But that's what made it real and yes, possible. You don't get the watered down version anymore. There was such a beauty to the madness of Portman's character's transformation from obedient little girl to daring woman. It coincided perfectly with the transformation of her stage character, the Swan Queen. I cringed at her blind obedience and constant apologetic state. And this made me anticipate the type of person she would become. It gave me chills watching her performance as the Black Swan. It's my favorite part in the entire film. The audience waits so long for her to finally let go. All that madness must result in no less than perfection.I attribute the success of this film to many factors, the haunting cinematography for its mostly dark and drab tones, the music for its surprisingly non-boring influence on the movie, and most of all the actors, who all showed that everyone, even nice people have a dark side.I look forward to seeing this movie again. 5 years later, I'm left amazed.",9,0,2,19 March 2015
It's a Wonderful Life," Depressed about how your life turned out? Watch this film
","Reminiscent of the story of Scrooge of A Christmas Carol, the movie in itself is predictable and slightly less haunting. Similarly, the center of the film is also focused on the Christmas holiday, making it much more dramatic because contemplating suicide on a night where everyone is celebrating is such an irony. Throughout the film, you feel powerless for George, as if all the world's problems continue to fall unto him, a character that most people can relate to regardless of age or generation. Dreams come with sacrifices.Supposedly a feel-good movie, its one of those where you are made to feel bad so you can feel better after. It has you cringing and falling flat on your face before you get picked up. Though the ending may be touching, it does not do much in terms of solving the main character's personal issues and is unconvincing in a real-world setting. Perhaps in an ideal world, that is all it takes to be happy.A movie with a big case of 'you don't know what you have til its gone'. All it takes is an imaginary slap and you're back to accepting the life you have been dealt, only this time, you're happier about it.From an optimistic point of view, the movie is a good reminder to everyone that happiness isn't a checklist you have to accomplish, but a state of mind you attain when you feel content.7 out of 10 stars, because it's a classic and has a better storyline and script than most movies these days.",7,1,3,1 July 2012
Her," Think a complicated long distance relationshipÂ….
","This movie actually made me cry! It was such a unique story. The acting of Joaquin Phoenix as the lonely letter writer, and the sensual voice of Scarlett Johansson as the OS perfectly portrayed what I would expect the love story between man and robot would sound like. Only, she didn't sound like a robot. She sounded like she had life, a personality. That's what made their combination so different from similar movies that came before. Finally, a robot that can reciprocate feelings! Every crack in her voice, every sigh she made, sounded like a long distance lover you couldn't wait to see. And Theodore lapped it all up like a puppy starved of love. The emotions and fights they had were reminiscent of real world couples, body or no body.It made me rethink how relationships work these days. As bad a rap as our generation gets for being constantly on our phones and laptops, sometimes it's the only way to stay connected to people that really matter. It's a significant form of communication but could never replace the comfort we find in being physically present for someone else.8 out 10 stars for a superb performance and a unique storyline.",8,0,1,17 February 2015
