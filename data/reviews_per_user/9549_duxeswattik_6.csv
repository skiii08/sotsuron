Hereditary," This is what horror cinema should be.
","Strange, yet personal. You get involved with the characters, start caring for them, while helplessly watching them perish, slowly & miserably. It's a shock to your senses. But it's definitely not the mundane jump scare horror haunting movie that you are already sick of. This is basically the evolution of horror cinema.",9,0,2,8 February 2020
Us," Absolutely disappointed, more so for the hype.
","The trailer was what got me interested to watch the movie in the first place. in the trailer it appeared as the family is being haunted by an unfathomable evil entity that resembles them physically, but seems to be something horrifying beyond comprehension.But even before the movie reaches interval, you get to know that the stalkers are just a family of misdirected doppelgangers created out of a freak experiment.
Then the movie then goes on to explain the back story of how they were bred & deprived of normal lives, which tries to create compassion in the viewer's mind. Now a director who fails to understand that you cannot be scared of someone you sympathyse with, as opposed to something that you do not understand. what you cannot understand, scared you the most. Wonder why Stephen king or Lovecraft never tried to provide a rational explanation of why their evil ones did what they did?
The movie starts as horror, soon becomes a science fiction, and ends as a secret society/ revenge/conspiracy theory - circus & goes all over the place but basically heads nowhere. While failing to do the most important thing, that is scaring the audience.",3,3,5,8 February 2020
Deadpool 2," I rated it 7 because deaplool & Ryan Reynolds are both favourites.
","Good funny parts, but not as great as the first one. Hope the next one has a better story to run with. The story seemed pretty mediocre and dragged.",7,0,1,10 June 2019
Drive," One of a kind.
","Thrilling, touching, sad all at the same time, & it felt good too.",8,1,3,10 June 2019
Prisoners," One of those movies..
","That probably deserve a 10.
Shocking, riveting, sad & a great cinematic experience in context of the story and the narration.",9,1,1,10 June 2019
The Nice Guys," These guys should make more movies like these.
",Classic action comedy thriller & the nice guys are just too cool for school.,8,3,4,10 June 2019
