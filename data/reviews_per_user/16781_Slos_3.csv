Requiem for a Dream," Rips out your intestines via your heart and eye-sockets.
","Aronofsky is an amazingly skilled director... I think he may also have had a bad 'trip' in his time. This is not an enjoyable film but it is superb... watching it ruined my night, since I wasn't able to relax afterwards, but it was well worth it. Should be interesting to see what he does with Batman!",Null,0,0,4 February 2001
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Widiculous Wibaldry
","This, my friends, is simply as good as it gets. Monty Python tear to pieces anything and everything in the name of humour; oh, MARVEL at the humour. In my opinion, no movie can match this for insight and intelligence [even Dr. Strangelove is left wanting] If you have half a brain and really listen to what is going on then you will appreciate the jokes. However, it is unlike the gang's T.V appearances and Grail; it is not completely without plot! This film rips to shreds all religion and the stupidity of rulers I think that you must be atheist to be able to stomach the message. If you can handle the deep end of humour then you surely have to watch, and concentrate on, this masterpiece. The late, great, Graham Chapman in his best ever role; he IS the greatest - a sadly overlooked talent who was much, much better than that Cleese fellow.",10,0,3,1 July 1999
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Perfect Python
","This is the guy's first effort at the big screen - it shows. It is, possibly, the funniest British film ever. You must not have a sense of humour if you do not laugh at the killer rabbit sequence or the knights who say 'Ni!' If you've not seen this film then you must; but beware, do not see it if you hate Python. Although the ending seems abrupt it is all part of the Python charm; if you really get the humour then you should delight in the ending. Michael Palin is a god and Terry Gilliam is magnificent [watch out for the horses!]",9,0,0,1 July 1999
