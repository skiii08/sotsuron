Lucky Number Slevin," Excellent movie a must see
","I just got done seeing Lucky Number Slevin and I must say I was very impressed. Well, I am even more amazed since my brother is the screen writer, so maybe I am a bit biased but wow I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. You get the feeling that everything in the movie is thought out down to the names.... and well that's the truth ;D The plot is excellent with twists and turns and yet it is something that you can follow while smacking yourself saying 'I should have figured that out!!' What a great cast they had for this movie and what an amazing job they did acting it out. Amazing job Jason and everyone else involved. Definitely a 10 out of 10 that you must see.Love, Your brother",10,1,7,7 April 2006
