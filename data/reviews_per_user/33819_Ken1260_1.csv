The Blair Witch Project," Disappointing and Boring
","This had to be the most boring horror movie I have ever seen. There was no suspense, all the horror parts lasted only seconds, while having them wander through the woods during the day took up the majority of the screen time. A lot of the reviews state there is a plot spoiler in the text, but how can you spoil a movie where nothing happens.  As far as believing it is a true documentary, the last part shows two of them running around, who is filming. I just wonder what happened to the people that found the so called documentary, did they die of boredom?  I'm not sure, but I'm sure we will have to find out in a sequel.",1,1,3,1 November 1999
