Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I'll give it a 5. But---if you want to compare and include this with the original trilogy, it receives a very low 3.
","I made the mistake going into the theater thinking this movie would give me the same enjoyment as the original trilogy. Sadly, this is definitely not the case. My first thought after seeing Phantom Menace was one of confusion. I wanted to make myself believe that I had in fact thought it to be spectacular and engrossing. But I soon realized that I felt a feeling of great disappointment to say the least. For one, the characters are not even nearly as likeable or as original as Luke, Han or Vader were. The story was very mixed-up feeling and kind of had me thinking 'what the heck is going on' throughout the film. I can't deny the fact that the visuals are very nice, but---this was the first movie that I actually wished they had used regular models in some scenes. The CG sometimes feel just that--computer made and very unlifelike. Even the music, was a little disappointing (John Williams has only done this once before, the very poor score for Lost World made me wonder if he had lost his touch). WARNING!!!--The character Jar Jar is by far, the worst example of a character in a movie created so the kids would have something to laugh at. He is annoying, adds nothing to the story and basically is a tag-along that does not belong anywhere in this movie. I'm still hoping his role in the next installment is a small one--very small. I actually have two ratings for this movie----on it's own, I'll give it a 5. But---if you want to compare and include this with the original trilogy, it receives a very low 3.",Null,0,1,25 December 2000
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Great fantasy adventure ends the classic trilogy.
","Return of the Jedi concludes Mr. Lucas' fantastic Star Wars trilogy. The movie is not as well though-out as the first two but it is still an amazing movie on it's own. The directing and dialogue are also sometimes weak and forced. But the scenes with Vader and Luke are very intense. They make the movie worth watching to the final climactic duel. As such with the other movies, the action goes back and forth quite frequently. While this helped out the previous two films, this tends to hinder this one somewhat. Just as a scene is reaching it's peak it goes back to the 'Battle of Endor' and kind of slows down. The music by John Williams is very good and some new themes introduced like The Emperor's theme and the Endor Battle are a joy to hear. The visuals in this one blow the first one out of the water. The Sarlacc and Jabba might seem kind of cheap by today's fake CG standards. But they actually have stood up well, even 20 years later. The battle scenes in space are still great to watch as well. The only sequence that seems dated is the Speederbike chase, but it still is fun to experience.The only other complaint I have with this movie was the Ewoks were a little too cute and cuddly for my taste. I didn't like the ending too much, either. I don't always like happy endings and I felt this movie needed a darker tone to end it. But, that's just my opinion.Aside from the sometimes somewhat cheesy dialogue and cutesy Ewoks, Return of the Jedi is an awesome movie that ends one of the best trilogies ever made.",Null,0,1,24 January 2004
Pearl Harbor," Wasn't expecting much. But what a waste!! A crying shame...
","The first time I saw the trailer for Pearl Harbor, I thought-'WOW! This might be really good!' That is until I discovered Bay was directing it. I don't understand why so many people say they were disappointed. They seem just as surprised as the U.S. military was that morning of 12-7-41. This was a stinker and you could see it coming way before it hit. I am a little disappointed that this project was given to Mr. Bay. A historical story such as Pearl Harbor should be taken very seriously and not glorified with overdone special effects and a lame plot. I recommend this movie to you if you like over-the-top and melodramatic action movies (i.e. Armageddon). This movie was made for the casual movie-goer who doesn't mind a lame brain story and just wants to have a fun day watching a bad action movie. I do not recommend this movie if you want a moving or dramatic account of that fateful day and appreciate quality cinematic experiences. Because Pearl Harbor is definitely not. I really hate the fact that Disney invested so much into this bomb (pun not intended). In short, this movie was a complete and utter waste of good money and time. With the amount of money used this should have been a quality epic. And to think, Michael Bay and Touchstone are cashing in on this atrocity of a movie. A real shame.",Null,0,0,18 July 2001
Total Recall," A surprisingly entertaining but still cliche sci-fi shootfest.
","Total Recall was a huge hit back in the summer of 1990 and it still is one of my favorite Arnold movies. I remember talking about it at school after everybody saw it. The directing is very ordinary but is also over-the-top and comical at times. That comes as no surprise since it is the same director who helmed 'Robocop' and 'Starship Troopers'. If you're an Arnold fan then Total Recall will definitely keep you glued to the TV. I consider this movie as one of the last good action flicks that was made prior to 1990 (since it was filmed in 1989). It does not have good acting, but give it a break, hardly any action movies ever do. The music is very good and composed by the great Jerry Goldsmith. The story is average and unbelievably sloppy. I give 'Recall' a 5 for the directing. A 6 for the script. A 5 for the acting. An 8 for the visuals and set designs. And a 9 for the music and sound. Overall, it is a gets a 7.",Null,1,2,29 November 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The original and still the best!!
","I can still remember watching this movie everyday over and over again with the same level of enthusiasm. This was the movie that made me realize as a 5 year old that movies could be pretty damn cool. The story of Star Wars was very easy to follow even as a kid. The special effects were groundbreaking for that time (I might add they still hold up well to this era of CG visuals). John William's score is still one of my all time favorites and really was the first sci-fi movie to use orchestrated composed music that was completely original. That brings my next point about Star Wars, I never considered it being an actual sci-fi movie. It may take place in space, but the story and characters made it more of an adventure that just happened to be in another galaxy.I don't think another movie will ever capture the imagination as much as Star Wars did for me. This is one of those movies that I will with-out-a-doubt want to view with my children. It's rare for movies to appeal to kids and adults the way this movie does. The first installment was simpler, yes. It was not as advanced, yes. The story wasnt as interesting as Empire, yes. BUT!! Star Wars is still my personal favorite in the original trilogy. (And Darth Vader is still one of the greatest vilains in movie history)",Null,0,0,24 April 2001
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The installment that all Star Wars movies should be judged by
","The original Star Wars was a great movie in it's own right, but the sequel blew that out of the water!! Empire was and still is, so far, the best Star Wars installment to grace our big screens. The plot line was superb and really made for a hell of a ride for us to enjoy. The character development in this movie, from Han to Leia, Luke to Vader, Lando to Han, etc. was perfect. The special effects were taken to a all new level of intensity (the Hoth battle is still one of the best battle sequences ever--real or not). And John Williams' score is phenomenal.
It is very rare for any movie to make this claim, but Empire is one of the few sequels that out shines its predecessor. I think one of the reasons I also like Empire so much is the fact that it gave the Star Wars universe a much more grittier and darker tone. Darth Vader really became one of cinemas greatest bad guys in this. And Boba Fett was quite the bad ass mercenary/bounty hunter.Another reason I believe Empire is so much more popular and better than the rest of the trilogy is due to the fact it has a very emotional side to it. This gives the viewer a chance to become more closely involved with all the characters. I strongly recommend Empire for anyone that enjoys movies that make you cheer for the good guys, jeer for the bad guys (or cheer, I still love Vader!!) and gives you an overall great movie experience. Empire is definitely a classic of our time.",Null,0,0,26 April 2001
