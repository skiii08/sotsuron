Raiders of the Lost Ark," Classic Movie
","This is one of the greatest movies of all time.  The people who made this movie were at the peaks of their careers.  Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford were in their prime.  Not to mention a great soundtrack by John Williams. Definitely one of his best and most well known.  There can never be another Raiders of the Lost Ark. It's just a classic.",10,0,0,11 October 2003
