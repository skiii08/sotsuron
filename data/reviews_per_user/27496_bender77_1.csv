Requiem for a Dream," wow
","This is the most powerful movie that I have ever seen. I only saw it once, so I won't get into technique, direction, etc. I only know that I have never been this disturbed by a movie. Many movies that I have seen such as Fight Club and American Beauty have left me with strong emotions, but they were generally positive. Not so in Requiem For a Dream. It left me with stronger, bleaker emotions than any other movie. On the ride home I was lost in my own mind, unable to escape from the unspeakable horrors that I had seen. In spite of this, I still plan to see it again as soon as possible. This is my favorite movie ever.10/10",Null,0,0,17 December 2000
