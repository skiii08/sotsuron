Iron Man 3," Irom Man 3 Big Budget Action...but
","I wish that when I was a kid they had been able to makes movies like this, with amazing CGI and incredible special effects! Being that I am not a kid any more, and I was a little disappointed with Iron Man 3, but I'll get to that in a minute.Most people won't be disappointed by Iron Man 3, so if you're on the fence about seeing it hop off and go check it out. There are plenty of surprises, wild Iron Man gadgets and of course plenty of action.Likes: First I really liked the villain(s) in this one. The 'Mandarin' was a good choice for bad guy and Ben Kingsly played the part perfectly. Aldrich Killian played by Guy Peirce did a superb job of the true mastermind of evil in this film. The CGI and the special effects were top notch as expected from any multi-million dollar project like this one. At first I did enjoy all of Tony Stark's different Iron Man suites, but it did get a little corny and over used towards the end of the movie. Dislikes: What I didn't like about the film was Tony stark really does not do all that much time in the Iron Man suite. What I really did not like about Iron Man 3 was the fact that Iron Man / Tony Stark is suffering having panic attacks from his time with the Avengers! He acts like a wimp through a good portion of the movie. And that was just not very cool.Thoughts: After seeing Iron Man 2 I was a little disappointed that I sat through it and was trying to be convinced by the writers that I should feel sorry for a mega wealthy playboy who is having trouble health problems, and now the writers want me to feel bad for the same guy who is having PTSD. Simply lame writing choices if you ask me. Overall though both movies were good in my opinion, but both had things that I didn't like. Simply lame writing choices if you ask me. Overall though both movies were good in my opinion, but both had things that simply irritated me. If the studio and writers are not careful they are in danger of going the way of the Batman series of the 90's, that started off great and just got completely worthless in my opinion.",7,1,2,17 May 2013
The Hangover Part III," Funny...but not that funny
","So, the movie is not a total disappointment, and with that being said it is definitely not as funny as the first...or the second for that matter. There are plenty of laughs, action, and classic Wolf Pack adventure, but it seemed a little flat and predictable to me.Things I liked: Zach Galifianakis, who plays the strange yet lovable Alan. A love interest for Alan played by the funny Melissa McCarthy. The wild adventure that the guys end up going on.Things I didn't like: No Hangover. Just a little to much Mr. chow. Did I mention No Hangover?Like I said not a total waste, but I should have waited for the DVD.",6,0,0,1 June 2013
