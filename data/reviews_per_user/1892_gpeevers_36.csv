The Devil's Advocate," On the Whole it's Enjoyable
","Story of a hotshot young attorney (Keanu Reeves) from Florida who has never lost a case. He is recruited by a prestigious New York law firm where he is taken under the wing of John Milton (Al Pacino) a senior partner who just might be......(well you can guess from the title).Treads familiar ground as lawyers are often portrayed as soulless monsters, but just goes that little step further. It's a little to long at 2 hours and 20 minutes, and the effects are at times a little cheesy and the Southern accents from Reeves and Charlize Theron who plays his wife aren't very good. But it is fun despite all that, and the set designs especially for the offices are great.The story is intriguing, if just a little over the top and there are no standout performances though Charlize Theron is good despite he accent and Craig T Nelson turns in a decent performance in a minor role. The ending though was cop out Hollywood ending that does mar the film.Paint in Black by the Rolling Stones is a nice choice for the closing credits.",7,0,1,26 March 2019
Spartacus," An Enduring Story
","Loosely based on a true story, Spartacus is the story of slave revolt against the Roman Republic led by a gladiator. The film details both the conditions and the struggles of the slaves as well as the reactions from the Romans and the political intrigue involved in the response to the rebellion. There is of course also a love story which is well handled but not entirely in keeping with the rest of the film. The film moves along effectively but does clock in at over 3 hours.The films great cast includes; Kirk Douglas, Jean Simmons, Laurence Olivier, Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov and Tony Curtis. The film was directed by Stanley KubrickThe score by Alex North is very effective for a score of that era.Script was penned by Dalton Trumbo a blacklisted writer, who was credited for his efforts and effectively ended the blacklisting. Many blacklisted writers and other film makers had been working in Hollywood for some time but they were not credited or acknowledged for their efforts and instead used pseudonyms. Based on a novel by Howard Fast, who was also blacklisted and briefly imprisoned, which is where he would begin writing the novel.The film has been almost entirely restored including scenes that had been cut for being to controversial at the time, but today seem remarkably tame.The film despite the controversy would go onto to be nominated for 6 Oscars of which it would win two; including Cinematography and a Supporting Actor nod for Peter Ustinov.The film despite its age remains quite powerful especially the iconic I am Spartacus scene.",8,0,0,1 April 2019
Casablanca," Greatest Film Ever for Me
","Why do I consider this to be the greatest film ever, to begin with I consider it to be the most enjoyable film I have ever watched and the most re-watchable. The key ingredients in my mind include; wonderful dialogue (so many quotable oft repeated lines), amazing performances, a superb story that while relatively straightforward is also highly enjoyable and finally the great black and white cinematography. Beyond these ingredients its also a film moves quickly and I can't think of a single scene I found either uninteresting or unnecessary.For those that desire a synopsis, Rick (Humphrey Bogart) is an American expatriate running a popular nightclub in Casablanca a city under Vichy control. The cool disinterested facade Rick maintains is shaken when Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) his former lover whom he thought dead appears suddenly in his club with her husband a resistance leader who requires safe passage out of German controlled territory. In order for the escape to succeed Rick must not only hide them from the Germans but also the local French police commander (Claude Raines) who is a friend but also a collaborator.My favorite performance here will always be that of Humphrey Bogart as Rick a man of nobility while evidencing ambivalence, but his performance is closely followed by the wonderful Claude Raines and the limited but iconic performances of Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre. While Ingrid Bergman apparently did not enjoy her experience and it may not be among her greatest roles I thought it was still a great performance, and also that the chemistry between Bogart and herself was utterly convincing. Further I found both Paul Henreid in the thankless role of the other man in the love triangle and Conrad Veidt as the local German commander to be quite effective along with a good supporting cast.As I have seen more and more of Michael Curtiz films I have come to believe he is an underrated director, its true he was not an auteur but a studio director who made the films he was assigned and he was not apparently a pleasant person to work with he has did leave behind an incredible legacy of films.",10,5,6,1 April 2019
The Big Lebowski," The Dude
","The 'dude' a.k.a. Jeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is unemployed and likes to bowl. He is unfortunately confused with another Jeff Lebowski who just happens to be very rich. When a case of mistaken identity causes the 'dude' to get beaten up and have his rug damaged he goes seeking retribution from his namesake, because 'the rug really tied the room together man'.The dude's bowling buddies (John Goodman, Steve Buscemi) commiserate and offer their advice while they prepare to meet their arch rival Jesus (John Turturro) in the league playoffs.Along the way the dude becomes involved in a kidnapping and runs across a number of strange characters including a fringe artist (Julianne Moore with a great throwback accent) and a group of German nihilist with a marmot.Weird and at times muddled (intentionally I think) story about confused identities and bowling, the actual plot owes a lot to Raymond Chandler detective stories and films based upon them. Thus we a labyrinthine plot and a large cast of eccentric characters.Features good performances across the board with some wonderful character work a trademark of a Coen brother's film. Also some surrealistic dream sequences and some effective camera tricks.No really deep meaning here for me but it's an interesting exercise in film-making. Not among my favorites from them but It still very entertaining.",7,3,4,15 May 2019
Unbreakable," M Night Shyamalan and Bruce Willis Second Effort
","Story of a security guard David Dunn (Bruce Willis) who is not the only the sole survivor of a horrific train accident but is also completely uninjured, as Dunn works to rebuild his relationship with his wife (Robin Wright Penn) he is contacted by a mysterious man Elijah Price(Samuel L Jackson) who has some unusual questions for him.The casting of Bruce Willis, Samuel L Jackson and Robin Wright Penn alone puts this film above your average genre picture especially when they are each given ample opportunity to display their craft as opposed to simply bridging the big action scenes.Yes this is essentially a super hero origins story, which many may not be aware before viewing the film. But it's not your typical superhero film, in execution its closer to the television series 'Heroes'. Like 'Heroes' a lot of time is spent on the characters background and development with the gradual realization of their abilities. It also doesn't have the nicknames, costumes or gadgets one might associate with the comic book superhero. The film moves at a very deliberate pace that many might find slow but the fine performances and gradual unfolding of an interesting story should make it worthwhile for most.Some of the shots are obviously framed like a comic book though less obtrusively than some other presentations, and as with most of Shyamalan films there is considerable attention to the visual elements and lots of darkness. There is also considerable emphasis on color.Although many have been disappointed with much of Shyamalan's post 'Sixth Sense' output, I find this film to be on par with its better known predecessor. Recently Shyamalan has said he is considering a sequel.",8,0,0,16 June 2009
As Good as It Gets," It is very good but perhaps not great
","Very good, well written romantic comedy with some very good performances and of course coming from James Brooks, some insights into human nature.Only flaws in my opinion is it was a bit too long and unfortunately as can happen with comedies the trailers have overexposed some of the films key comedic moments.",8,0,0,22 March 2019
Amistad," A Solid Film though it is one of Spielberg's Weakest Efforts
","True story of a group of African slaves in 1839 led by a man named/re-named Joseph Cinque who rebel against their Spanish captors and seeking to return to Africa accidentally end up in Connecticut where they are brought to trial for mutiny and murder in a case that would eventually find its way to the U.S. Supreme Court.A surprisingly uneven film from Steven Spielberg, while it does have great moments it really does not do the stellar cast or historical facts justice. The film is not as visually stunning as you would expect from Spielberg and near the end there are some particularly cheap looking special effects.The performance by Anthony Hopkins as John Quincy Adams is particularly good, and this was also the first notable role for Djimon Hounsou.",7,0,2,12 March 2019
Captain Marvel," Slow Build to a Really Strong Addition to the MCU
","The initial plot is ok and fun at times, but it's not the most inspired beginning despite some good early action scenes. But the slow buildup makes sense based upon the storyline, so it ok that it took me a little while to get fully involved. But once the characters reach the farmhouse, and the direction of the story becomes clear the movie really takes off. The result is a really good movie with some really good characters, great action scenes and strong emotional moments both humorous and otherwise.We have a compelling heroine in Captain Marvel/Vers/Carol Danvers, delivered by a great actress Brie Larson (much deserved Oscar for Room). But she's hampered somewhat in her ability to connect with the audience early on, because the characters motivations and true origin don't become realized until 2/3 of the way into the film. Still the character is heroic and humorous throughout.I agree with others that the Ben Mendelsohn character (Keller/Talos) is a standout, but I think it's not only because of his acting abilities but because he is recognized for his big bad genre characters like he played in both Rogue One and Ready Player One. And this makes his characters revelation/development all the more powerful.The de-aging process used on both Samuel L Jackson (Nick Fury) and Clark Gregg (Agent Coulson) is for the most part quite effective, though in a few cases the close-ups lasted a little too long and it didn't stand up as well as it might have.After the recent influx of 80's nostalgia in movies and TV it was nice to see some 90's nostalgia.I would definitely rank this is the top 1/3 of the MCU movies released thus far.",8,5,21,11 March 2019
Alien: Resurrection," Third Favorite Alien Film ... But it's a Really Good Franchise
","Not as atmospheric/claustrophobic as Ridley Scott's 'Alien', not as action packed as James Cameron's 'Aliens' and not as introspective as David Fincher's 'Alien 3', but its probably second in each of these categories which makes it a satisfying if not original or entirely successful.The film comes across a little disjointed in its feel which could be the result of struggles between a behemoth Hollywood studio and a French art film director. There are some amusing interspersed with scenes of all out action. The performances are strong if lacking any real standout's. And the special effects are very good.Both Ron Perlman and Dominique Pinon have appeared in previous films for Jeunet who really does seem to have a taste for unique faces which he also gets from Brad Dourif.Jeunet has made two much better films, Delicatessen and the brilliant Amelie.",7,0,0,21 March 2019
Seven Years in Tibet," Entertaining if not Engaging
","It's a very attractive film to look at, and the score is great but I found it a bit slow moving and lacking in emotional impact. Overall it still makes for a satisfying experience and an interesting look at a society largely shut off from the outside world.Jean Jacques Annaud is an interesting filmmaker with a distinctive style, I though his best was Name of the Rose but I also liked Quest for Fire and Enemy at the Gates.",7,0,0,24 April 2019
12 Angry Men," Incredibly Good Film
","An incredible film that is even more incredible for the fact that it was filmed almost entirely in one small room and was made on a surprisingly small budget. The film did have a top Hollywood star in Henry Fonda but while director Sidney Lumet would go on to an amazing career this was his first work outside of television. The film earned 3 important Oscar nominations for Best Film, Best Direction and Best Writing but would lose all three categories to Bridge on the River Kwai and was not successful at the box office. Despite all this more than 50 years later this film currently sits at #5 on the IMDB Top 250 films of all time, a position that I believe is justified.The film is essentially the story of a jury deliberation of a murder case involving a Hispanic youth that initially appears to be clear cut until one man raises questions mostly to ensure that everyone has given the case their full consideration, when doubts arise the tempers flare and the prejudices of some jury member's surface. Now instead of an exercise in fair play we have the juror's undertaking a decision that will determine the fate of a young man whose innocence becomes more and more likely.The most effective aspects of Lumet's direction are making a film that is almost entirely dialogue in one room incredibly compelling and making that single set dramatic and effective. The tension mounts through out the film as the deliberation nears it conclusion and Lumet adjusts the cameras and the lenses to build a feeling of claustrophobia in the small extremely hot jury room.The other major contributor was Reginald Rose who wrote the screenplay and co-produced the film with Fonda.In addition to Fonda in what I believe is his best career performance we have host of recognizable faces including; Martin Balsam, Lee J Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Warden, Ed Begley and one very recognizable voice is John Fiedler who better known as the voice of Piglet in Winnie the Pooh.",10,0,0,1 April 2019
Bloody Sunday," Dramatization in a Documentary Style
","Director Paul Greengrass's retelling of the events in Derry, Northern Ireland on January 30, 1972, where an ostensibly peaceful march for civil rights ended in bloodshed.The facts are that 13 protesters were shot and killed by a British Paratroop regiment brought into try and capture supposed hooligans using the march as cover. In the immediate aftermath the Army claimed they were fired upon and simply responded with appropriate force. The eyewitnesses including some members of the media tell a different story now corroborated by at least one of the soldiers indicating that there was little if any provocation. This is the perspective from which the story is told. It is also the consensus of the film makers that this event did much to escalate the 'Troubles'.The film gives glimpses of individuals amongst both the protesters and British Army. Our main protagonist is one of the marches primary organizers Ivan Cooper (James Nesbitt) a Protestant and a Nationalist who strongly extolled non-violent protest. We also focus on one of the young protesters and several member of the British Army some of whom are more sympathetic than others.The film employs a simple looking documentary style, with hand held cameras and no additional lighting. The color is de-saturated in what has become a short hand style of retelling historical events. The events in the story transpire over a 24 hour period.The cast features some talented veteran actors alongside a large number of non-actors, including locals from Derry who were there on that day or in several instances relatives of some of the victims. Also many of the soldiers in the film were former soldiers, some having served in Northern Ireland and at least two of which were actual Paratroopers.",7,2,7,19 June 2009
Us," Not Quite What I Expected from the Trailer's
","While it's more of a horror film than Get Out, it's not your typical modern horror film of the cheap thrills or gross out schools. It's a very well paced film that sets up the story and the characters, while slowly ratcheting up the tension - much like A Quiet Place did. Along the way we get some nice bits of humor (mostly thanks to or at the expense of Winston Duke) and nice depiction of family dynamics.It's beautifully shot with an effective score and some well used songs. And while the plot is far-fetched it is still done in convincing fashion within the context of the film - again somewhat like A Quiet Place.We get a really wonderful performance by Lupita Nyong'o who has once again managed to totally transform herself for her roles. She is supported by uniformly good supporting cast but it's mostly her film.While some may say the reveal was obvious I thought it was nicely handled and well earned.",8,2,8,1 April 2019
Blade," Just What We Needed a Comic Book Vampire Hero
","Our hero Blade (Wesley Snipes) is part vampire (his mother was bitten just before he was born) who is out to rid the world of vampires so that everyone else can live happily ever after and he can live with himself. In order to satisfy his thirst for blood he takes a plasma serum that his mentor and fellow vampire hunter Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) developed, but its effectiveness is waning. Also along for the ride is a doctor (N'Bushe Wright) who was unlucky enough to also get bitten by a vampire but who is conveniently a hematologist who just might be able to develop a cure for our heroes problem. Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) is our hero's nemesis, a leader among the vampires who were infected as opposed to the more reserved purebred vampires, and just to make things a little more interesting Frost has a sinister plot in motion that must be stopped.Snipes is well cast in a role he could sink his teeth into (sorry), it may not be the role of a lifetime but was certainly an improvement over some of the parts he had inexplicably taken. In the character of Blade we get an intriguing tortured hero, and while this isn't a character piece its still interesting to watch. As for the rest of the cast, Kristofferson is fine in a fairly stock role, but both Dorff and Wright are fairly forgettable.A movie with lots of noise, lots of gore and lots of visual effects, it's certainly enjoyable on a live action comic book level. The two sequels have their moments but aren't nearly as interesting movies",8,0,0,1 April 2019
Superbad," Great Laughs But The Story Could Use Some Work
","Two friends and not so popular teens Evan (Michael Cera) and Seth (Jonah Hill) are about to graduate from High School. Both are looking for social acceptance and romance (or possibly just sex) while contemplating the fact that they will be attending different colleges next year. A big end of year party offers them a chance at social acceptance, if their possibly more socially inept friend Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) can acquire the booze they need with his new fake ID. Our second or 'B' story involves a pair of police officers who seem to have their own issues with maturity.The film definitely delivers some incredible laugh out loud lines and great scenes but that alone doesn't guarantee a great movie.While the writing is obviously very important in comedy also essential are the actors that deliver those lines and performances. We start here with a trio of exceptional young actors. The very talented Michael Cera and Jonah Hill may be known to some from their previous efforts, but scene stealing Christopher Mintz-Plasse makes his professional debut here. The performances from the police officers (Bill Hader and Seth Rogan) while at times hilarious seemed a little over the top, which kind of reflects their story as well.The film was written by Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg (notice the first names), directed by Greg Mottola (The Daytrippers) and produced by the now very hot Judd Apatow (The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up).Overall the film lacks something in its cohesion, rather than telling a story (or several stories) it seemed at times more like a framework in which to place the jokes and the hilarious set pieces. Also somewhat off putting was the fact that the two different stories seem to reflect very disparate levels of reality. While this approach may have supplied a lot of laughs it might have been improved from a storytelling point of view by sticking with just one story and developing the characters more fully.",7,3,6,19 June 2009
The Hustler," Great Performances Great Atmosphere
","The story of a cocky up and coming pool shark Fast Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) who wants to challenge a legend of the game Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason).The entire film is good but it truly shines once it moves inside the pool room, these scenes just seem to drip with atmosphere.Certainly one of the standout aspects of the picture is the acting. We have Paul Newman giving one of his career defining performances. There is Jackie Gleason best known for the role of Ralph Kramden on the Honeymooners who truly excels here in his role. We also have strong performances from Piper Laurie as Felson's somewhat damaged love interest and George C Scott as his possibly dangerous manager. Although none would win all four would be nominated for Oscars.The film would be Nominated for nine Academy Awards of which it would win two (for Cinematography and Art Direction/Set Decoration).It would be followed 25 years later by a sequel Color of Money, directed by Martin Scorsese.While a professional pool player has become known by the nickname Minnesota Fats the film is in fact the origin of that moniker.",8,0,0,2 April 2019
The Caine Mutiny," Bogart Playing Against Type
","The very compelling and powerful story of the events leading up to a mutiny on a World War II US Navy Destroyer-Minesweeper 'The Caine'. As the story begins the ship's captain (Bogart) has become increasingly paranoid as a result of battle fatigue. When the ship runs into a storm the officers are torn as to what action to take as the captain becomes more and more isolated and possibly a danger to the ship and crew.The film was well directed by Edward Dmytryk who had made several very good noir films and received an Oscar nomination for Crossfire. This was a comeback for Dmytryk though as he had been one of Senator Joseph McCarthy's Hollywood Ten and was not only blacklisted but also imprisoned for Contempt of Congress.One of the most impressive aspects of the film is the utterly convincing Humphrey Bogart who is cast completely against type as the deteriorating Captain Queeg. The remainder of the cast including Fred MacMurray, Jose Ferrer, Van Johnson, Tom Tully and E.G. Marshall give good performances but nothing like the performance by Bogart.The film was based on the Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Herman Wouk.The film would be nominated for seven Academy Awards, although it would win none. The film was also a huge commercial success.At the insistence of the Department of Defense the titles at the beginning of the film tell us there has never been a mutiny upon an American Navy vessel. The studio agreed to this as they needed the cooperation of the Navy in providing the vessels on which much of the action was filmed.",8,0,0,2 April 2019
Armageddon," Put Your Brain On Hold and Enjoy the Adrenaline Rush if You Can
","A deep core drilling team lead by Bruce Willis and including Ben Affleck and Steve Buscemi are the Earth's only hope to prevent a massive asteroid from devastating the planet. Despite there lack of experience in space they are the only ones with the requisite skills and thus are sent to land on the aforementioned asteroid. We also have Liv Tyler as both the daughter of Bruce Willis and the love interest of Ben Affleck. While Billy Bob Thornton rounds out the all-star cast as the NASA Administrator.Sure it's ridiculous with plot holes as big as the 'Texas sized' meteor, and the intrepid shuttle crew is faced with one contrived potential disaster after another, not to mention a heap of incredibly obvious emotional manipulation. The scene where the Russian cosmonaut and the Russian space station are introduced is incredibly over the top. But it is still an exciting adrenaline filled summer blockbuster, though far from the best of its ilk.On a few positive notes, the special effects are for the most part quite good for its time, the performers are likable and the emotional manipulation despite its heavy handedness can still be effective.The shots from the second unit which feature a vast array of citizens from all over the world waiting for the oncoming disaster and for the Americans to save the day of course are so ambiguously commercial that you could slap any corporate logo in the world on top and produce a very nice looking 30 second television commercial.",6,0,1,19 June 2009
Ratatouille," Another Triumph for Brad Bird
","Walking into a Pixar film I have always expected great animation going all the way back to their award winning short films but for some reason I am often surprised by the strength of the story.This story in particular, a rat who wants to become a gourmet chef seemed like it might be a tough sell, but the characters are interesting as is the story and with the current trend towards elevating the art of the chef it is extremely timely.As good as all of Pixar's films are though I found those directed by Brad Bird (though he took this film over partway through production) to be among the best. Both Monster's Inc and Iron Giant (not a Pixar film or computer animated) are among my favorite animated films.There are a number of wonderful frantic scenes that capture ones attention, but the highlight scene for me would be a flashback scene later in the film with a technical flare.While this is a family movie like all Pixar's films I wondered whether the deliberate pacing and more involved storytelling of the middle part of the film might not maintain the attention of younger children.",8,0,0,2 April 2019
Saving Private Ryan," Hard to Believe this did not Win the Oscar
","Incredibly harrowing and unrelenting look at the horrors of war filmed with hand held cameras and using film stock and lenses that give it both a documentary and historical feel in an attempt to give the audience some sort of visceral impression of what it might have been like to be there on the beaches of Normandy. The audience is dragged right into the film and with only a few slow scenes you soon discover that three somewhat grueling hours have passed.Some of the characters are somewhat cliched, in that they are stereotypical for war movies which I think may be intentional on the part of Spielberg to give more impact to his vision by making the characters familiar to the audience. Further it is also somewhat reminiscent of other recent war movies like Platoon in it depictions of the horrors of war, but I though it went even a step further in that it never tries to make the combat in any way poetic. The music isn't used in the same way or does it rely on voice over's or any other cinematic tools to make the combat scenes any less horrifying.I found this to be perhaps Tom Hank's best performance and although he would nominated for an Oscar he would not win, perhaps his two fairly recent Oscars had some effect. The rest of the cast is uniformly strong and effective, there are some great cameos and the film served to accelerate the careers of relative newcomers Vin Diesel, Barry Pepper and Edward Burns as well as some of the other more experienced cast members.While I don't believe this was Spielberg's best (Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Schindler's List) and he does use a few unnecessary directorial tricks this is still a really great film that should have won the Oscar for Best Picture. It's not a film for the faint of heart but it is a very powerful film that effectively delivers the directors vision. The film would secure Spielberg an Oscar for Best Director among its 5 wins and 11 nominations.",9,1,2,1 April 2019
Good Will Hunting," Really Good
","Troubled youth (Matt Damon) with a genius level IQ comes to the attention of a math professor (Stellan Skarsgaard) at M.I.T., where he is working as a janitor. In order to avoid prison our protagonist agrees to work with the professor and see a therapist (Robin Williams) who has his own set of problems. He also falls for a student (Minnie Driver) and continues to hag out with his blue collar pals (Ben Affleck chief among them).Very moving an honest picture with a real sense of purpose. The performances are really great across the board, in particular this stands out as on of Robin Williams best dramatic performances. The picture looks great and the director Gus Van Sant takes a real low key approach which really works.",8,1,2,6 May 2019
The Game," What to Give to the Person Who has Everything
","The story begins with the 'what do you give to the man who has everything' concept as Michael Douglas plays the obscenely rich Nicholas Van Orton a man about to celebrate his 49th birthday. The answer to the question comes from his brother played by Sean Penn who is the prototypical black sheep of the family. The gift is 'The Game' it is apparently the next step in entertainment - an all-inclusive life experience, it may his brother claims change his life. The game is run by a company called CRS (Consumer Recreation Services), and before they let you play you are required to go through a complete battery of psychological and physical tests.The story is intriguing, the performances are good and the production values are great. It's a little to long at 2hrs+ but that is only a minor complaint.
It's not the most profound film, but to its credit it did leave me thinking at the end.Great choice of Jefferson Airplane's - White Rabbit as the song over the closing credits.",7,2,2,2 April 2019
The Longest Day," Hollywood's Invasion of Normandy
","Based on the novel of the same name by Cornelius Ryan this film tells the story of the D-Day Invasion from a wide variety of perspectives. The film follows both the Americans and the British as well as the Germans. We also see both the commanders and the men in the field as well as all the different aspects of the invasion force.The major stars included; John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Richard Burton, Sean Connery, Robert Mitchum, Rod Steiger as well as least another dozen well known names.It is perhaps the huge cast or more accurately the large number of individual stories being told here that make it difficult to connect more closely with the film. Though this may have been necessary to demonstrate the scope of the invasion. Most of these individual stories are compelling as are the performances, but the sum of the parts ends up a bit too disjointed. So while this remains an impressive achievement that I recommend, the film falls a little short of my expectations.The film marked as least the temporary return of the noted producer Darryl F Zanuck from a lengthy self imposed exile. This was also considered to be the last epic filmed in black and white.",7,1,3,22 June 2009
Moulin Rouge!," A Truly Modern Musical
","My favorite musical, it's also a tragic love story and is at times very funny.An idealistic young writer Christian (Ewan McGregor) is wooed by the Bohemian lifestyle flourishing in Montmartre district of Paris where he falls in love with Satine (Nicole Kidman) a singer and courtesan at the famous nightclub Moulin Rouge. Along for the ride are Jim Broadbent (who would win an Oscar for Iris the same year) who plays Harold Zidler the club's manager, John Leguizamo as Toulouse-Lautrec and Richard Roxburgh as The Duke the couple's nemesis.Baz Luhrmann (Director, Writer, Producer) expressionistic vision is visually captivating and that combined with the film frenetic pace and wonderful use of contemporary music makes this a truly memorable experience.Strong performances from Kidman, McGregor, Broadbent and others but the exaggerated style and approach keeps these from being award winning roles though they are wonderful performances. In addition to their acting talents Kidman and McGregor are both worthy of praise for their singing talents, and Broadbent's single musical contribution is definitely memorable.Moulin Rouge was the third part of Luhrman's so called Red Curtain Trilogy, the first two parts being Strictly Ballroom and William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet. The films share a creative team in addition to design and thematic elements though the stories and characters are not connected.The film was recognized throughout the world and nominated for 8 Oscars including Best Picture and would win two of them Costume Design and Set Decoration â€“ Art Direction.",9,2,2,16 June 2009
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Less Wonder More Excitement
","While the dark mood and feel of this chapter in the Harry Potter saga may startle some, I thought the style and tone were a less of a departure from previous films, and more like the biggest step in the shift that began with Prisoner of Azkaban. I also thought that director David Yates the least well known of the directors in this series really captured the feel of the book and I look forward to his return for Halfblood Prince.I found the pace of this film as it built towards its final confrontation to be the most exhilarating in the series. While I understand that some may have found it a bit choppy, for me the jumps that caused problems for others were simply filled in for me from what I consciously or sub-consciously recalled from the book.The size of the book necessitated drastic editing to fit within the available running time and while I may miss some of the flavor I think the final result captured that which was essential. As always I look forward to the DVD for the deleted scenes and I would love to see an extended version someday.I have enjoyed all the films (as I have the books) in the series for different reasons and though for me Prisoner of Azkaban was the weakest it was still for me an enjoyable film. It is very encouraging to see a series of books so consistently well adapted to the screen.While it is somewhat unfortunate it was also wonderful to be able to see this veritable who's who of a generation of great British actors appearing briefly in what are essentially cameo roles. Just look at this list; Richard Griffiths, Ralph Fienes, Brendan Gleason, Gary Oldman, David Thewlis, Maggie Smith, Julie Walters, Jason Isaacs, Michael Gambon, Imelda Staunton, Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Helena Bonham Carter and Robbie Coltrane.While the performances of the three leads could easily be over shadowed by such a stellar supporting cast I believe they have continued to develop and portray their characters effectively.",8,0,1,17 June 2009
Chariots of Fire," Surprising Oscar Winner
","Winner of 4 Academy Awards in 1982; including Best Picture, Best Score and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen. This film was widely viewed as one of the surprise winner's of the Best Picture Oscar.The story of two very different British runners, as they prepare to compete in the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris. Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) an English Jew faces both prejudice for origins and criticism for his use of a professional trainer Sam Mussabini (Ian Holm) in his preparations for the Olympics. His rival and teammate Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson) is a devout Christian whose life ambition is to become a missionary. Liddell see's his running as a way of glorifying god and memorably follows one of his races with a sermon. The film is both a powerful and stirring story of perseverance and also a story of conscience.The cast included such notables as Nigel Havers, John Gielgud, Alice Krige, Brad Davis and director Lindsay AndersonThe standout scenes for me would both be running scenes. Firstly we have The Great Court Run at Trinity College, Cambridge. Secondly of course we have the iconic opening beach running scene at St Andrews, Scotland. Strangely, for the film the Great Court Run had to be recreated at Eton College because the film makers were refused permission to film at Trinity College.The film features a stirring soundtrack by Vangelis (Vangelis Papathanassiou), which may sound a little dated (to some perhaps) with its use of synthesizers, but regardless it remains incredibly effective.

","Story begins with a High School nerd (Ben Stiller) who meets and falls in love with a beautiful girl (Cameron Diaz) who asks him to the senior prom. But before they leave the house he suffers a very painful and embarrassing accident and never sees her again. Jump forward years later and he wants to find her again, so his best friend (Chris Elliot) suggests an insurance investigator (Matt Dillon) who does some part time investigative work.Some very funny slapstick moments but between these comedic outbursts it can be a bit slow. Requires a tolerance for comedy that pushes the boundary of good taste.",7,0,2,16 April 2019
Titanic," Nice Love Story with A Great Backdrop
","Neither as good or as bad as the hype might have led me to believe.The love story is good and the special effects are good, but considering the material Cameron was working with he didn't really produce anything that another director might have with a similarly astronomical budget or possibly a whole lot less.This is definitely a film for the big screen or at least the biggest screen you have.",7,1,1,16 April 2019
It's a Wonderful Life," Holiday Treasure
","This is easily my favorite Christmas film and also one of my favorite films of all time.The story of George Bailey (James Stewart) who as a young man dreamed of traveling the world and making a difference, until outside influences and obligations tie him forever to his small home town of Bedford Falls. While George endeavors to make a difference in Bedford Falls while raising a loving family, circumstances would once again take a hand causing George to questions what good his life has been and whether everyone would be better of if he had never been born. Thus we have the premise upon which our story will focus with some very obvious debts to Charles Dickens 'A Christmas Carol'.While the movie wasn't a huge success upon its initial release it would still be nominated for 5 Oscars including; Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Editing. And this film has a very impressive pedigree in terms of both its Director Frank Capra and its cast. So while some will see this film as a surprise belated hit I don't think it's really all that surprising.The films cast includes five Academy Award Winners; James Stewart, Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore, Thomas Mitchell, Gloria Grahame along with Ward Bond, H.B. Warner and a pair of Academy Award nominees in Beulah Bondi and Henry Travers.The message of film along with its depictions of family, friends and small town life are the great strengths of Director Frank Capra's work perhaps best realized here. Although Capra would not win here, he would earn three Oscar's as best director over his career.As has oft been told, the films popular revival is due largely to a lapse in its copyright in 1974 which allowed local TV outlets to air it for free which made it very popular as seasonal programming.",10,2,7,17 June 2009
To Kill a Mockingbird," Great Film with One of the Greatest Performances
","The story of a widowed small town southern lawyer Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) with two small children who takes on the case of a black man charged with the rape of a white woman in the 1930's. Despite the possible harm to his own career and threats of harm Atticus pursues what he believes to be the just and right course of action under the watchful eyes of the town and his children.While I have always greatly appreciated any film that can create a sense of time and place, for me very few films can compare with To Kill a Mockingbird for this transcendent quality.Although I certainly respect the dramatic abilities of Gregory Peck he is not my favorite actor, although in this role he delivers one of my favorite performances of all time. He is note perfect in creating a heroic fatherly figure that still feels like a real person. The role earned Peck his only Oscar after four other nominations.In addition to Peck we also see the film debut of another great actor with Robert Duvall's small but integral role and we have many very good supporting performances including Brock Peters in one of his first film roles as Atticus's client.Although Robert Mulligan would direct some other successful films this film stands head and shoulders above his other achievements.The cinematography of Russell Harlan should also be acknowledged it earned him one of his 6 Oscar nominations.Based upon the Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Harper Lee, the novel is at least semi-auto biographical with Scout filling in for Lee and supposedly Scout's friend Dill was based on her friend Truman Capote. Strangely Harper Lee would never write anything more other than some essay's, there have been entirely unsubstantiated rumors that Lee did not write the book or at least received considerable assistance from Capote. The script was adapted by Horton Foote and earned him his first of two Oscars, Lee herself was greatly impressed by his adaptation.",10,0,1,1 April 2019
Scream 2," Can't Live Up to the Original
","The characters that survived the first film return and the story picks up just as a film called Stab based on the events from the first film is released and somebody starts murdering teenagers again.Suffers because its sequel and because of the genre, the writing is good and the performances are certainly above average for a slasher film. But despite the fun it has with sequels and references to all sorts of other things it still comes back to being a slasher film and that really is a limitation. The original had the advantage of bringing back and all but dead (sorry!) genre and parodied many of the situations and archetypes that typified those films, the sequel does not have that advantage.",6,2,3,28 March 2019
Jaws," Truly Impactful Film
","While there are other great suspense movies this was certainly a milestone. Through the use of music (John Williams) and other tools Spielberg actually made people scared to go in the water, oddly paralleling what occurs in the movie.The stories have grown that it was the failure of the animatronic shark that subsequently forced Spielberg to cleverly shoot and edit around the shark and thereby in its absence build the suspense far higher than it might have been had the shark been available. While these stories may or may not be true the effect is still impressive.The film also benefits from Spielberg's ability to capture the regular routine of everyday life of the residents in a beach side resort as the summer season swings into high gear.The final ingredient is the strong performances particularly from the trio of Robert Shaw, Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfus,",8,0,1,2 April 2019
The Truman Show," The Ultimate Media Satire
","Story of Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) a man who has lived his entire life on TV without ever knowing it, everyone he has ever known was an actor and everything in his life has been scripted. Broadcast 24 hours a day from hundreds of hidden cameras in the largest television studio in the world and using a cast and crew of thousands. This is the ultimate satire of life in a media fishbowl. While he has been provided with an almost perfect existence, Truman is not entirely happy and he has begun to suspect that something is going on around him and that things may not be what they seem.This is also the story of the audience and their dependence on this real life soap opera that has been broadcast everyday for over 10,000 straight days, and finally it is a story about the media as personified by Christof (Ed Harris) who has become the ultimate manipulator of life.At the heart of the picture we have a well told story from screenwriter Andrew Nichol who would be nominated for an Oscar and directed by Peter Weir also Oscar nominated and one of his 6 Oscar nominations (four of which were for Direction. Both plot and character are given considerable attention here so we follow incidents but also the affects these developments have upon the characters.The title role is well played by Carrey who gives his most restrained performance up to that time, Laura Linney gives another strong supporting performance and Ed Harris seems perfectly cast as the creator and master manipulator of this all encompassing media event, and for which he would be Oscar nominated.",8,2,2,1 April 2019
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," It's Still Just Star Wars to Me
","While I will acknowledge its faults this is still one of my favorite films of all time. I remember see the film when it was released and despite have seen it many, many more times since, it still remains compelling and exhilarating when I watch it today. I have enjoyed all the films in the series and I know that many will argue that 'The Empire Strikes Back' is the better film but for me 'Star Wars' please don't call it 'A New Hope' has always been best entry in the series.The film tells a story of epic proportions and creates a fascinating world (or several worlds if you like) while also delivering swashbuckling like action and a battle for the future of a galaxy. The characters to me are so effective and iconic; there is the mystery of Alec Guinness's Obi Wan Kenobi, the cockiness of Harrison Ford's Han Solo and the menace of James Earl Jones/David Prowse's Darth Vader. The hero of the story of course is Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) who isn't as effective as the aforementioned supporting characters but that's not unusual and he still easy to cheer for with the exception a few minor quibbles. We also have Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) who begins as the damsel in distress who shows she is more than just a damsel but still isn't given quite as much to do as in the sequels where her character would get more development. Finally I can't forget Peter Cushing as the chilling Grand Moff Tarkin.The effects certainly look a little dated but either through the subsequent new editions or simply recalling how startling the original effects were over 40 years ago this does not affect my enjoyment of the film whatsoever.For me an integral part of the film is the wonderful John Williams score, which remains my favorite score of his from a truly incredible career.While I will freely acknowledge George Lucas has his faults and made some mistakes, I also feel he is a visionary filmmaker who was able to deliver some incredibly imaginative films.",10,0,0,1 April 2019
The Wedding Singer," First Adam Sandler Film I Ever Enjoyed
","Set in 1985 it's the story of a wedding singer (Adam Sandler), who is seeking the stability and security of marriage when he is stood up at the altar. On the other side waitress (Drew Barrymore) who is seeking the same and about to marry the wrong guy.Cute and relatively inoffensive with some nostalgic and very funny reflections on the music and 'culture' of the 1980's. When I first saw this movie upon it's release I went in virtually kicking and screaming after having the misfortune of catching the truly awful Billy Madison on television. But here Sandler is much more restrained than in some of his previous efforts.The two leads come across well enough but they are not really breaking any new ground here and the cameos are well used, in particular Steve Buscemi as a drunken best man. The films strength is largely ins 1980's satiric nods.",7,2,2,19 March 2019
The Godfather," Incredible Film-making
","The story of a Mafia family it's about honor and loyalty but it's also a story of crime, it both espouses and perverts the American dream. The film has so many iconic scenes that stand out in the memory, even when years pass between viewings. The film was based upon the best selling novel by Mario Puzo.The film has an amazing cast who bring to life memorable and well rounded characters to earn our sympathy, despite some of the deeds they perpetrate. While Marlon Brando would receive the accolades and the Academy Award, we also have Oscar nominated performances from James Caan, Robert Duvall and Al Pacino. Also of note is John Cazale (he appeared in only 6 films before his untimely death, all of them were nominated for Best Picture). Not to be forgotten are; Sterling Hayden, Diane Keaton, Abe Vigoda and Talia Shire. The cast between them have thus far won 5 Oscars wins and been nominated for another 22.We have the incredible score of Nino Rota remains one of the most evocative scores in film, and it is a tribute to the composer and the film that just a few notes can conjure such images almost 50 years later.We also have the wonderful cinematography of Gordon Willis who created such powerful images, at times very warm while at other times so very dark.There's no doubt that the film does paint a somewhat romanticized portrait of a mafia family but it's not just a film about crime it's about family. The film was followed up shortly by a very good sequel (Godfather II) that maintained the high standards of its predecessor even to the extent of achieving the Academy Award for Best Picture, but for me it wasn't quite as compelling. These films were followed by a less memorable sequel (Godfather III) 16 years later that while earning 7 Oscar nominations itself, mostly served as a reminder of how much less powerful it was than its predecessors.",10,3,4,1 April 2019
