Iron Man 3," no way is this iron man
","I have to say this was not iron man 3 this was tony stark and his suites, how in heavens name was this movie ever allowed to make it to the screen should have gone straight to DVD, that would have been more or less Justice for the poor excuse of a movie. i hope that if there are any future releases of Iron man that the writers be changed and that we get more value for money spend. then there is the mandarin wow what a waist of what could have been a big time villain brought to live movie action but hey they gave us glow in the dark villains, and a hippie pretending to be super bad, i have never really thought i would say this but iron man died in avengers after this movie was made.",1,6,13,21 May 2013
Man of Steel," Best Superman EVER
","Thank You Thank You I had never in my life enjoyed a movie from start to finish like i did this one superman movie. Good plot good explosions well done Zack Snyder you did me proud. Looking forward to the next one. I have no complaints at all. The story of how he grew was not over done the distraction was what one would expect in a superman movie. Russel Crow you where brilliant as Jor AL Henry Cavil made me believe he is the man of steel. Hope the next installment we get to see Lex Luther and hopefully some hint as to the Justice League, I believe with some like Zack Snyder at he Directors Chair we can have a truly epic Superman and Justice League franchise in the future as for know i am watching this movie again today",10,3,11,29 June 2013
