The Blair Witch Project," Don't close your eyes -- Elly Kedward will get you.
","It is to the 'Blair Witch' filmmakers' (and I am talking about Myrick and Sanchez, not Donahue, Leonard, and Williams) great credit that for the most part, they get away with the central conceit that three tired, hungry, lost, and above all, frightened-out-of-their-minds documentarians would still keep rolling footage under the dire circumstances in which they find themselves -- for that is one of the movie's only shortcomings (even though the majority of the audience won't notice or won't mind).  The Project's plus column, however, is far longer than the minus one, as the very fabric of the improvisational techniques employed holds together an authenticity virtually guaranteed to send shivers down the backs of all but the most road-hardened horror vets.  The interplay among Donahue, Leonard, and Williams is refreshingly funny in the early stages, which only ratchets up the intensity when doom seems to be knocking (or howling or scratching or leaving creepy tokens outside the campers' tent).  The Blair Witch Project has all of the necessary sequences to assure its cult status (I love the stick figures) and the mysterious, dread-filled ending will most certainly set fans arguing -- once they catch their breath.",Null,47,92,27 July 1999
Antz," Reasonably entertaining animation showcasing Woody Allen
","I did not see Antz until after I had seen A Bug's Life, and I had the strange feeling I would have liked the former film better than I did had I seen it when it initially hit theatres. Antz is much darker and more serious than A Bug's Life, Woody Allen's solid one-liners notwithstanding. I was also surprised by how 'adult' the film felt in terms of its dialogue, plotting, and angular (some would say ugly) character animation -- not to mantion the overall darkness of the design.  Some Allen fans will be pleased, as typical Woody-style jokes are transposed into insect vocabulary.I personally favored Z's off-color retort following an invitation to drink some aphid beer. Allen did not write the film, but just as well could have considering how tailor-made some of the jokes were for him.",Null,0,0,17 February 1999
Casablanca," Towering masterpiece of American cinema
","Quite possibly the greatest, if not most entertaining, motion picture ever made, Casablanca shines like platinum.  Perhaps it is Bogart's indelible Rick Blaine: cynic on the outside, humanist on the inside.  Perhaps it is the writing: unforgettable from 'Here's looking at you, kid' to 'We'll always have Paris' to 'This looks like the beginning of a beautiful friendship.'  Perhaps it was just the serendipitous combination of assembled personnel once cameras began to roll on the Warner Brothers lot during WWII. Rick's internal conflict, so simply presented in the movie, conceals an existential dilemma that stands at the heart of Casablanca's enduring legacy: the difficulty of taking the morally responsible action even (or rather, especially) when it is at the expense of personal desires.",Null,2,2,28 January 1999
Se7en," Superbly crafted drama delves into darkest corners of the psyche
","David Fincher's bleak, relentless, and ultimately terrifying crime thriller Seven transcends other films of the genre with incredible plotting (the sort Hitchcock might employ were he alive and making films in the 1990s) and scalding intelligence.  With only a small handful of minor flaws -- the overly familiar retiring cop/young cop pairing; the awful 'I'm taking you off the case!' cliche seemingly required by the genre; one giant lapse in logic in the downward spiral toward the conclusion that cannot be revealed without ruining the script's gruesome surprise -- Seven typically keeps its viewers imprisoned in their seats with a combination of morbid fascination and abject fear.  Despite attempts by studio executives to alter Andrew Kevin Walker's ending, the filmmaking team prevailed and audiences experienced that rare treat of mainstream cinema: an uncompromising vision.",Null,135,174,16 August 1999
Citizen Kane," Towering accomplishment from wunderkind Welles
","Citizen Kane, created by a twenty-six-year-old Orson Welles, is one of the most durable and praiseworthy films in the history of the medium.  And quite rightfully so.  With its incredible deep-focus photography, fractured narrative, fluid camerawork, and many other superlative aspects of filmmaking, Citizen Kane moved both the industry and the art form into previously uncharted territory.  A colossal achievement, the film richly deserves its place among the most revered and respected works of cinema.  In much of the critical writing on Kane, Welles often receives the lion's share of credit, but I cannot imagine the film without the contributions of Toland, Mankiewicz, Herrmann, Cotten, Sloane, and so on.  Even after multiple viewings, it is easy to discover new, previously overlooked details that are completely astonishing.",Null,4,11,2 February 1999
The Birth of a Nation," America's first major feature is Griffith's folly
","Whether or not one buys into the long-standing suggestion that D.W. Griffith virtually invented much of the 'film grammar' (the close-up and the cross-cut, for example) and the American feature length film used by narrative moviemakers to this day, The Birth of a Nation remains a simple-minded, horrifyingly racist piece of garbage unworthy of its misguided praise.  Griffith's pathetic Victorian sensibility -- already on the verge of being old-fashioned at the time of The Birth of a Nation's release in 1915 -- undermines the epic's value as the genesis of film as art, even if its lavish release and exorbitant ticket prices gave cinema its first taste of respectability.  Cases in point: the god-awful leap off of a cliff by Mae Marsh to avoid being raped by an emancipated slave and the idiotic, preposterous plotline in which Lillian Gish is to be enthroned alongside a black leader who plans to start a 'Negro' nation.  So much for Griffith's attitudes about Reconstruction.",Null,5,15,28 July 1999
Shakespeare in Love," Impressive spin on Shakespeare, with a contemporary feel
","Tom Stoppard, who penned Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, knows a thing or two about the modern deconstruction and reconstruction of Shakespeare's work -- and it shows in the bright and vivid Shakespeare in Love, which Stoppard co-wrote with Marc Norman.  Applying many of the same conventions favored by Shakespeare in his own work (including primarily the confusion over mistaken identity and gender) the screenwriters begin with the 'what if' premise and run with it, speculating with wicked delight on the Bard's rivalry with Christopher Marlowe, his use of overheard phrases finding their way into his plays, and best of all, the possible sources of his inspiration.  Will's muse is Violet, played wonderfully by Gwyneth Paltrow, who shows off in this film her finest acting to date and credibly pulls off the tricky task of being both an object of poetic inspiration and a genuine, down-to-earth human being.",Null,44,67,13 January 1999
Alien: Resurrection," In space, no one can hear you sigh
","Alien Resurrection is the most radical departure in the series that has now spanned centuries in its own universe and nearly twenty years of our own earth time.  Gone is the meticulously constructed suspense of Ridley Scott's 1979 original.  Gone is the heart-stopping pulse of uncannily staged action from James Cameron's 1986 sequel.  Gone is the Ripley who cried and fought and bled and sacrificed her own life to save the world from the horror she very nearly unleashed in David Fincher's atmospheric and underrated Alien 3. Instead, we get the all-new Ripley: cynical, sardonic, and ready with a wisecrack or a fist for anyone who crosses her path.  Director Jeunet unfortunately seems to bask in self-parody, and this is where the film goes wrong.  He serves up plenty of nasty evisceration and gruesome chest-bursting, but by now we have seen so much of the creatures that they are no longer terrifying.  Still, I have a lasting affection and fascination with this series -- and Jeunet Alien is better than no Alien.",Null,116,201,25 February 1999
Elizabeth," Violent and sexy historical costume drama
","Anglophiles who demand fact over good drama might blanch at the substantial creative license that littered Shekhar Kapur's Elizabeth with historical inaccuracies, but lovers of texture, tone and mood will undoubtedly champion the flick for its exciting depiction of political intrigue.  Cate Blanchett leads a great cast of noteworthy talents like Geoffrey Rush, Christopher Eccleston and Fanny Ardant (John Gielgud even shows up as The Pope) through a sumptuous depiction of 16th century life re-imagined through costume and production design with a decidedly Indian spin.  The transformation of Elizabeth into The Virgin Queen is a show-stopper which Kapur daringly swipes directly from the legendary baptism scene in The Godfather.",Null,0,0,23 January 1999
L.A. Confidential," A beautiful love letter to classic crime cinema
","Director Curtis Hanson, according to Arnon Milchan in the L.A. Confidential DVD supplement, was the perfect choice to adapt (along with Brian Helgeland) James Ellroy's novel.  It certainly shows.  Favoring rich characterizations over strict plotting, the movie retains many of the novel's key set pieces and enough twists and turns to keep even hard-boiled audiences happy. Pearce, Crowe, Spacey, and Basinger all shine in roles seemingly tailor-made for them -- another credit to Hanson's canny sensibility about the material. Period detail is delicious, with stunning set design, costumes and wonderful tunes by the likes of Johnny Mercer, Chet Baker, and Dean Martin. Some critics complained that the film was 'overlong,' but repeated viewings reveal the opposite -- a tightly crafted picture among the best of its kind.",Null,1,1,4 January 1999
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," One of cinema's best and funniest offerings
","Dr. Strangelove, Stanley Kubrick's masterful study of the foolishness of war and the incompetence of the men who start them, is blacker than pitch and funny in ways that most films can't dream of approaching.  Faultless direction, writing, and performing cemented the picture as a modern classic, making it hard to believe today that it was something of a wild card in its initial release during the chilliest days of the Cold War.  The incomparable Peter Sellers devours three roles, and is equalled by the sublime turns of Sterling Hayden and George C. Scott, never more brilliant or funnier than they are here (playing gum-smacking, belly-slapping, gung-ho dim bulb Buck Turgidson and paranoid, crazy as a woodpecker, 'precious bodily fluids' loose cannon Jack D. Ripper, respectively).  Keenan Wynn and Slim Pickens are also top-flight.",Null,3,5,21 January 1999
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Fantastic conclusion to legendary saga
","Return of the Jedi is so often characterized as the 'weakest' installment of the Star Wars trilogy that some of the series' finest moments and set pieces are overlooked.  The entire sequence at Jabba the Hutt's palace is a tour-de-force in the grand tradition of pirate adventure films and the resolution of the Darth Vader/Luke Skywalker storyline displays some tremendously powerful emotions.  Additionally, one might argue that the climactic light saber battle between Vader and Skywalker is the best duel of the whole series, combining brilliant editing, lighting design, and amazing music cues.  Finally, I can hardly imagine a more exciting cinematic thrill ride than the potent Endor speeder bike chase.  My favorite image, however, is the silhouette of Luke as the smoke from Vader's funeral pyre rises into the night sky.",Null,1,2,5 January 1999
Barry Lyndon," Opulent costume drama from the great filmmaker
","Kubrick's adaptation of Thackeray's Barry Lyndon sharply divides fans of the great director's work, as the languid pace and seemingly interminable running time -- not to mention Ryan O'Neal's questionable performance in the title role -- are cherished by some and deplored by others.  Little argument will be made against John Alcott's Academy Award-winning cinematography or Ken Adam's production design, however, and Kubrickian motifs are manifest in the gallery of characters' wide-ranging displays of cowardice, guile, duplicity, avarice, jealousy, greed, and cruelty.  Marisa Berenson is terribly short-changed in her role as the Lady Lyndon, but a number of other performers are given the opportunity to create a handful of memorable moments -- especially Arthur O'Sullivan (albeit briefly) as the charming, intelligent highwayman and Patrick Magee as the Chevalier.  Love it or hate it, Barry Lyndon will remain essential viewing for aficionados of the director, who enjoys taking his usual shots at the more discouraging aspects of human behavior.",Null,71,86,24 August 1999
The Passion of Joan of Arc," Dreyer's masterpiece one of cinema's greatest artistic triumphs
","One of the last great silent films made during the advent of sound, Carl-Theodor Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc is a haunting, riveting portrait of the historical martyr based on documentation from the original trial.  Focusing primarily on the series of courtroom examinations that doomed the young warrior, the film gloriously employs vivid close-ups to accentuate the ordinariness (while at the same time exaggerating the most grotesque qualities) of Joan's inquisitors.  Maria Falconetti is unforgettable as Joan, perfectly distilling the pain, terror, and saintliness required by what is probably one of the most demanding roles an actor could attempt.  The consequence of Joan's conviction -- her burning at the stake -- allows Dreyer to hammer home his exquisite visual motif balancing erotic corporeality with transcendent spirituality.",Null,36,46,29 July 1999
The Godfather: Part II," Excellent continuation of the classic saga
","I do not like The Godfather Part II as well as the original, if only because the shift in focus from the subtle machinery of the Corleone family business to the historically inspired (Kefauver hearings, collapse of the Batista regime in Cuba) episodes shortchanges the elegant simplicity of the first film.  We have already witnessed Michael's incredible transformation from 'civilian' war hero into hard-as-steel overboss in the original, and this makes his character less interesting to me.  I do not wish to suggest that Part II is not a good film.  On the contrary, the intercutting of the Vito Corleone story with Michael's trials, troubles, and challenges gorgeously punctuates the importance of family tradition so crucial to the film's thematic fabric.",Null,3,5,16 March 1999
He Got Game," Powerful filmmaking from the always worthwhile Spike Lee
","Spike Lee's love letter to the game of basketball goes above and beyond the modest expectations one might have about a film with a popular sport at its core.  An exegesis on a painful, nearly unbearable father/son relationship, He Got Game is one of Lee's best features since his masterful Do the Right Thing.  Critics seemed to endlessly harp on the ham-handed, borderline obnoxious religious symbolism, but I admire and love Spike Lee for daring to attempt something so risky and bold.  The juxtaposition of Aaron Copland and Public Enemy played brilliantly as sweeping accompaniment to the thrilling, skillful interplay on the court and as commentary on America itself.  Denzel Washington provides another incredible performance, and newcomer (and real-life NBA player) Ray Allen holds his own.",Null,0,1,2 February 1999
Dark City," All style and no substance sinks this promising film
","My expectations were high indeed once I had seen the preview for Proyas' Dark City.  My hopes and dreams were dashed, however, when I settled in for the film and was confronted by one-dimensional characterization and a mountain of unnecessary over-explanation of everything going on -- as delivered by an unintentionally hilarious Kiefer Sutherland (reminding me of the most egregious stereotypes of mad scientists this side of Peter Lorre and the buck-toothed, lab-coated crazy on The Simpsons).  Sadly, the luminous Jennifer Connelly was under-used and her leading man Rufus Sewell had all the charisma and charm of a wilted, rotting carrot.",Null,3,7,4 January 1999
The Exorcist," Prototype 'blockbuster' a dazzling cinema achievement
","That The Exorcist is among the most imitated films of its kind should be evidence enough of its lasting power and value as a motion picture experience.  But what so many of those pretenders fail to offer is what Exorcist expert Mark Kermode points out in his BFI study and the 1998 documentary that accompanied the 'special edition' DVD release of the film: Blatty and Friedkin made a movie that intelligently and thoughtfully examined possibilities that no person, atheist or believer, wants to imagine -- that something evil could desecrate and profane the most basic and precious commodities of our lives: the home and the child.  If you are only after cheap thrills, ignore The Exorcist, since what you will find here is a movie that requires you to think about the nature of good and evil.",Null,1,1,8 January 1999
American History X," Solid sociological study of racism
","Even though first-time feature director Tony Kaye shot himself and his credibility in the foot when he went on a media tirade against the so-called 'Edward Norton Cut' of American History X, the picture still delivers as a tense, effective drama worthy of serious thought.  Kaye may have sounded both whiny (about the final edit) and ridiculous (his boast that he was 'minute for minute' a better filmmaker than Stanley Kubrick), but he shouldn't disown the version of AHX that made it to the theaters.  Perhaps he was jealous of Norton, whose electrifying performance as neo-Nazi Derek Vinyard anchors the film.  Ultimately, the script might have been the fly in the ointment of total critical success, as a number of plot points stretch credulity.",Null,0,0,23 January 1999
A Bug's Life," Delightful animated film has plenty to offer
","A Bug's Life considers a number of the same themes (individuality vs. utilitarianism, for example) that are found in Antz, but the Disney/Pixar film stays more firmly rooted in the breezy, family-friendly zone than the Dreamworks competition.  I agree with the critic who suggested that spinning The Seven Samurai into a children's story featuring insects was a stroke of genius.  And few would disagree that the samurai, here made over into a circus of misfit bugs, provide the most colorful moments in the movie.  The non-English speaking duo of Tuck and Roll, voiced by Michael McShane, were perfectly realized by their animators, who captured a hilarious vacancy on their faces as they listened but didn't comprehend what was being said to them.  These two stole every scene in which they appeared, and came back for a couple of triumphant moments in the phenomenal 'bloopers' that roll during the credits.",Null,0,0,6 January 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," Breathtaking masterpiece from genius Kubrick
","A grand experience of sight and sound, 2001: A Space Odyssey is handily one of the most sumptuous, opulent, magnificent motion pictures ever made.  A worthy example if one was ever called upon to defend film as art, Kubrick's perfectly paced masterpiece manages and manipulates the film grammar in ways unseen since Citizen Kane.  Wholly original in its execution of the texture of space travel, its technical achievements are virtually unsurpassable.  No film before or since has so fully realized the majesty of the reaches beyond the earth nor the fragility of our own concepts of such places. Additionally, the eerie, frightening, ghost in the machine we call artificial intelligence is rendered through the HAL 9000 with unforgettable results.",Null,1,4,4 February 1999
Singin' in the Rain," Quintessential American musical one of Hollywood's finest
","Singin' in the Rain is probably the greatest musical in the history of the motion picture and arguably one of the finest films in general.  The movie approaches perfection on virtually all fronts: superbly integrated numbers, breathtaking dancing, inspired performances, and great dialogue -- all wrapped up in a movie-lover's dream: a story centered around the mad scramble of Hollywood studios to make the transition to sound during the late 1920s.  Gorgeous color is like the icing on the cake, as vivid reds, blues, and yellows seem to leap right off the screen.  Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds, and Jean Hagen are all smashing in their roles; I am doubtful there are more than a handful of films with as absolutely faultless casting.",Null,0,5,13 January 1999
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," As cinema, Salo is just plain old fecal matter
","When he embarked on what was to be the final film of his career, Pasolini might very well have been attempting to send a message to his native Italians about their complicity with the Nazis during the course of World War II, but his adaptation of the Marquis de Sade's incendiary work of transgression suffers from the cinema's one unforgivable sin: it is deadly dull.  Certainly many viewers will be turned off by the repeated depictions of rape, sodomy, coprophagia, sexual humiliation and torture, but these horrors are treated so casually by the director that the alienated audience is given zero incentive to care a whit about anything transpiring on the screen.  With the exception of a very miniscule treatment of two young girls who support one another when one of the pair cries that she cannot go on, Pasolini exerts no effort to create sympathy for the enslaved children. What is undoubtedly meant as a commentary on the 'banality of evil' comes out in the wash as just a banal film.",Null,9,24,10 August 1999
The Red Violin," Measured, thoughtful account of near-mystical instrument
","Literally spanning centuries to unfold its mesmerizing tale, The Red Violin traces the unbelievable history of an acoustically flawless masterpiece crafted in the late 1600s by an Italian master.  Co-screenwriters Francois Girard (who directed) and Don McKellar (who acts in the film) structure the movie around a wealth of richly detailed locales, including Vienna, China, and Oxford, and provide a unique modern-day Montreal framework which intertwines with the often tragic history of the instrument to provide the narrative with a rather unique element of mystery.  The late-19th century English section shows the film at its most baroque, but each of the finely tuned tales reaches for some truth about music, life, love, and passion -- and that is commendable.  Music lovers take note: the sounds that come out of the crimson treasure throughout the course of its journey are utterly thrilling and inspiring.",Null,34,41,6 August 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Compelling, complex observation of fidelities and fantasies
","With the exception of a late-occurring scene of deadening over-explanation wholly unnecessary to the film on every level (and rather unusual for Kubrick), Eyes Wide Shut is utterly sensational, and represents another gleaming jewel in the master filmmaker's already studded crown.  Cruise and Kidman surpass all of their previous work, turning in spectacular performances infused with nuances only hinted at prior to this outing. Their real-life union appears to bring every bit of unique tension Kubrick intended, as the movie wholly depends on the verisimilitude of the central couple's relationship.  Kubrick's tone fulfills all the promise of the title, consistently delivering an elevated texture of almost uncanny imagination perpetually hovering between fantasy and reality.  The director additionally mines many of his familiar thematic concerns, including deceit, paranoia, and blinding frustration.  Eyes Wide Shut is certain to be as closely scrutinized as many of Kubrick's other films (particularly because it is his final work), and its thoughtful and challenging treatment of such lightning-rod topics as marital honesty, sexual jealousy, and the perceived risks of disclosing one's fantasies (even to the single person you trust more than any other) is sure to draw some people in while pushing others away.",Null,94,156,19 July 1999
Some Like It Hot," Like Jello on springs
","The dazzling team of Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond deliver the textbook screen comedy in Some Like It Hot, one of the most charming, brilliant, and hilarious films of the American cinema.  Marilyn Monroe is luminous as the aptly named Sugar Kane, and the dynamic duo of Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are knockouts (in more ways than one) as two down-on-their-luck musicians who disguise themselves as women to avoid a mob rubout. It is nearly impossible to overstate the quality of Some Like It Hot, which seems about as close to perfect as a feature film can get.  From Monroe's scorching sex appeal to Lemmon's verve and elan, from Curtis' dead-on Cary Grant impersonation to Joe E. Brown's legendary final line, Some Like It Hot is a supernova in movie heaven.",Null,1,1,17 February 1999
The Green Mile," Second King period prison flick from Darabont no Shawshank
","Despite some terrific performances (particularly from supporters David Morse and Michael Jeter), Frank Darabont's adaptation of Stephen King's serialized novel The Green Mile falls far short of the director's previous effort, The Shawshank Redemption.  Revolving around a series of unusual events taking place on death row of Louisiana's Cold Mountain prison in the mid 1930s, the film focuses on head guard Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks), easily cinema's most humane and forgiving penitentiary employee -- who also happens to have a vicious urinary tract infection.  Unfortunately, the rest of the formidable cast lines up along one of two polar opposites: either big-hearted and destined for sainthood or malevolent and hateful.  This approach robs the characters of much-needed complexity, and infuses the proceedings with a rote predictability just an inch from the borderline of formula.  The Green Mile's significant running time (at least a half hour to an hour longer than needed) isn't justified by the subject matter, and the bizarre and unnecessary framing device undoubtedly works better on the page than on the screen.",Null,0,2,14 December 1999
The Iron Giant," Guns kill.
","An ambitious take on Ted Hughes' 1968 children's book The Iron Man, director Brad Bird's The Iron Giant works well as both archetype-infused allegory and heartstring-tugging tale of friendship.  Set in small town Maine in the 1950s at the height of Cold War paranoia, the film explores the relationship between a lonely, fatherless boy (a photo on a nightstand hints that the father was a combat pilot killed in WWII) and a monstrously huge, hulking metal behemoth (the origins of which are brilliantly left to the imagination).  The animation marks a welcome contrast from the virtually ubiquitous Disney template, with the human characters bearing a stylized, comic book exaggeration that fits perfectly with the story material.  The Iron Giant has more than enough imagination and sparkle to interest kids and adults, and nicely balances its action-adventure aspirations with a solidly-crafted sense of moral purpose.",Null,46,59,2 August 1999
The Silence of the Lambs," Perfectly executed dramatic thriller
","The Silence of the Lambs, having accomplished the rare feat of winning all five of the major Academy Award categories, is a remarkable achievement in filmmaking.  Gruesome, pulpish material was transformed by dedicated participants on all levels of production, and a film that would have failed in the hands of many others wound up becoming a modern masterpiece.  Taut direction and a superb screenplay might be the best arguments for the film's power, but the flashiest are certainly delivered in the bravura performances of Hopkins and Foster.  Their interplay -- and remember, they only share a handful of scenes together -- is nothing short of riveting.",Null,138,208,12 January 1999
Trainspotting," Energetic, intelligent and involving story of Scottish drug addicts
","Trainspotting, a film that earned almost instantaneous cult masterpiece status, expertly depicts the multi-faceted heroin experience of author Irvine Welsh's excellent novel.  The Shallow Grave team of Andrew MacDonald, John Hodge, and Danny Boyle go for the throat, and deliver a deliriously cinematic jewel that is equal parts fantasy, comedy, and harrowing drama.Superb use of music and eye-opening set pieces (like the 'filthiest toilet in Scotland') never upstage the colorful characters -- people who behave despicably and deplorably, shamefully and amorally, and yet endear themselves to viewers who find their wicked wit and charming smiles irresistible.  Lothario Sick Boy, hapless Spud, psychotic Begbie, and wise-beyond-her-years schoolgirl Diane are unforgettable, but it is Ewan McGregor's exhilarating and incredible turn as Renton that commands the greatest attention and leaves audiences invigorated and begging for more.",Null,1,1,17 February 1999
The Matrix," Pretentious and tiresome film features superb sfx
","It is really a shame that the talented Wachowski brothers did not spend more time paring down the sprawling, unwieldy, and ultimately confusing and unsatisfying plot threads of The Matrix and settle in on one.  Had they found a way to drop about thirty minutes of this overlong and oftentimes dull hodge-podge, the truly spectacular martial arts and digital effects would have seemed even more special.  A cyber-flick owing an equal debt to Blade Runner and Lewis Carroll, The Matrix collapses under the weight of an idiotic and mind-numbing New Testament-like structure that finds surrogates for Christ, Judas, etc.  Joe Pantoliano, so thoroughly excellent in the Wachowski's previous outing Bound, is helpless and hapless playing the underwritten Cypher, but Hugo Weaving easily gives the worst performance of his career as a strictly one-note, wooden bad guy in the grand tradition of one-note, wooden bad guys.",Null,2,3,7 April 1999
The Thin Red Line," Poetic, existential vision not likely to satisfy the mainstream
","Terence Malick's hypnotic, visionary film The Thin Red Line will likely frustrate and confuse most mainstream cineplex audiences, but it is a work that should not be dismissed or taken lightly.  Arguments have been made that the reduction and combination of characters and a clearer narrative drive would have improved the picture, but it is clear that Malick's intentions lie elsewhere.  I was hypnotized and mesmerized by the beautiful images (many of them captured with a gliding, soldier's eye-level Steadicam) and the juxtaposition of the lush, natural world against man's intrusive, incomprehensible  carnage.  The Thin Red Line will forever suffer from the inevitable comparisons to Saving Private Ryan (a much more conventional film), but this is terribly unfortunate, since the two movies are so fundamentally different.",Null,0,0,19 January 1999
The Godfather," An offer you can't refuse
","The Godfather is as beautifully directed, photographed, designed, edited, scored, and performed as any American film -- it is a masterpiece in the broadest sense; a colossal accomplishment for Francis Ford Coppola in the decade he virtually owned as a popular and artistic filmmaker.  Indelible scenes need only a word or two to ignite the memory: the baptism, the horse head, Sonny's fate, the restaurant murder, and the list goes on.  Brando and Pacino are fantastic, but I love to praise the work of James Caan and Robert Duvall.  Their roles might be smaller, but I couldn't imagine the film without them.  The fury with which Sonny unleashes the brutal beatdown of Carlo is palpable, and I adore the brilliant impartiality and distance kept by the camera (it seems to hover in medium shot just far enough to keep the children playing in the opened hydrant in frame during the course of the pounding) as well as the other onlookers who know better than to get in the middle.",Null,1,2,16 March 1999
