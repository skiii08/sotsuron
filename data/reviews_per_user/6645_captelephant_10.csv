Sucker Punch," A Pretty Disappointment
","I desperately wanted Sucker Punch to be good. Any large-budget blockbuster that has the balls to include dragons, mechs and nazi zombies in its PREVIEWS gets bonus points with me. But Sucker Punch isn't very good. It's joyless and heartless and somehow manages to take itself waaaaay too seriously despite the aforementioned dragons, mechs and nazi zombies. For a movie that should be non-stop fun it's surprisingly dreary. That could have worked if that dreariness had generated any power or depth or emotional attachment, but it doesn't, so instead of being dramatic or epic the movie just becomes boring. The interchangeable, embarrassingly over-fetishized girls are utterly invincible and never in any danger whatsoever... until the plot suddenly needs them to be, which is cheap and, again, boring. The brothel scenes almost immediately became tedious and I found myself impatient for the next action scene to begin.Of course the action is fantastically well filmed and the special effects are gorgeous. Snyder is probably the best action director working today. But in Sucker Punch it's all so meaningless and lightweight that I felt more numbed than excited. And that's probably the most impressive thing about the movie: how do you make steampunk nazi zombie zeppelins unexciting? See Sucker Punch and find out! Sucker Punch really isn't terrible. It's just a typical, brainless blockbuster that squanders its unique subject matter. It could have been so much more.",5,1,6,27 March 2011
Cloverfield," Doesn't perform miracles. Does entertain.
","Cloverfield won't change your life. It might make you puke in a movie theater, which I guess could be life-changingly embarrassing, but aside from that you'll leave this film the same person as when you entered.That said, it does what it sets out to do admirably.The first few minutes of action are extremely intense, very heavily evoking 9/11 memories for better or for worse. The film keeps a fast pace from that point on, but never again recreates those initial moments of fear.The characters are likable, realistic young New Yorkers who are established ~quickly~ and effectively. Their behavior throughout the film fall somewhere short of realistic and there is heroism to a degree that seems sometimes unbelievable, and yet... people do heroic things in times of crisis. I'm inclined to believe that some people (not most people, but some) would indeed do what our main characters do.The 'camera work' is a mixed bag. It's sometimes very effective and fun (the beginning and the military scenes are stand outs). It's also frustrating at times, and occasionally feels like it's try to save budget by not showing us what we obviously want to see. Overall I think it works in Cloverfield -- it gives the film a unique sense of immersion -- but I would not want to see this approach overused. It will become one-note very quickly.Without giving too much away: the ending is a shock. It will leave some viewers frustrated and others impressed. I was impressed. I thought it was ballsy and unique, and I appreciate its purity. I do not blame people for being annoyed by it, however.Overall I enjoyed Cloverfield. It's a rush. It's funny and honest and likable. It's different. Give it a look, but temper your expectations: it's just an action flick, folks.",7,1,4,24 January 2008
Watchmen," Too close to the comic for its own good
","THE GOOD: Watchmen does 90% of everything it tries right. It's beautiful, intelligent, well-acted and beautiful again. Rorschach is AMAZING and Dr. Manhatten is spot on. Most of the dialog, often word-for-word from the comic (yes, sorry, graphic novel), is razor sharp, and the plot, while imperfect, is still head and shoulders above the norm.Unfortunately, the 10% it does wrong is probably the stuff that will stick with you.THE BAD: I respect Snyder for his determination to follow the comic to the letter, I really do, but he has to learn when to step back and let a movie stand on its own feet. For example: the story could and should have been restructured to avoid the cluster-bomb of flashbacks crammed into the first hour. And Bubastis seriously had to go.Then there's the terrible, embarrassing-to-the-point-of-movie-damaging porno scene dead smack in the middle. Why!? If there was ONE place to stick with the comic (where this scene is short and tasteful) this was it.Finally, the sound track is distracting. It's not that the songs are bad, but the placement, volume and arrangement of said songs makes it all too clear that many are only here for commercial tie-ins. There are of course exceptions (loved the intro and the comedian's funeral).Overall Watchmen is an achievement in many ways. It's not perfect (nor was the comic to be honest), but it's damn good. Highly recommended.",8,2,6,19 March 2009
The Exorcist," Somewhat Overrated
","I liked the Exorcist. I did. But it didn't scare me.That's somewhat fatal to the 'best horror movie of all time' moniker, as I'm a pretty easily scared moviegoer. Ultimately, it left me disappointed.As others have said, the movie starts out amazingly. The scenes in Iraq: trembling hands, frightening statue, fighting dogs. Excellent. By the time it cuts to Georgetown it has you ready for the worst.The next forty minutes lose some of that momentum, but still hold promise. Between the increasingly ghoulish series of medical experiments inflicted on Reagan and Father Damian's incredible visits to his mother (the second being the most impressing), you're really ready for the horror to begin full bore.But it never happens. We're treated to what amounts to an hour long montage of 2 minute 'shock clips' that range from silly to disturbing, but never exactly scary. Promising earlier devices such as the Ouija board, the evil statues and the noises from the attic are all frustratingly abandoned.The claustrophobic atmosphere of the bedroom and upstairs hall are repeatedly interrupted for no good reason. The introduction of a totally unnecessary police detective both wastes time and provides disastrously unneeded comic relief. There's no way to maintain a persistent atmosphere of dread when the Mother of the Possessed is signing autographs over coffee in a sunny morning kitchen with a smiling, mustachioed detective who apparently wandered in from a different movie. Talk about a mood killer.I'm coming off as overly negative: The Exorcist is not bad. There are a thousand and one worse horror movies. But it's not nearly as great as I had been expecting, either. No doubt in '73 it was unlike anything audiences had ever seen, but in '07, I'm sorry to say, it appears to have lost its power.",6,1,4,10 June 2007
No Country for Old Men," Anti-climactic to the point of painful
","Plenty has been said of No Country for Old Men's strengths, and it's all true. Dialog, casting, acting and cinematography really could not have been done better.But ending is so wildly disappointing that it makes the above strengths seem almost inconsequential. After literally two hours of build-up our cast of core characters are finally all going to meet at a single location. This promises to be a magnificently interesting show-down. Instead, the film takes a sharp turn towards the artsy by suddenly killing the main character off-screen and devoting the final 20 minutes to disjointed (though well-written) philosophy discussions.This might be entertaining for the 'cinema' crowd that views the act of subverting expectations and breaking convention as entertainment in its own right. But for the majority of movie-watchers (yes, even the intelligent ones) it's just disappointing.What was the point of all that tension-building if nothing comes of it but abstracted dialog that would have been just as relevant when the movie began? Why devote ~hours~ building this character if he's going to be ingloriously killed off-screen by unnamed and barely-explained gangsters? Why was Woody Harrelson's character even in the film? In the end No Country will leave you feeling let down, and that's always a bad thing no matter how artfully it's done.",7,1,4,8 August 2009
Transformers," Needs more bots, less plots
","Why does a film supposedly about giant, warring robots spend literally 2/3rds of its time following around a dozen boring, nameless humans?Why are there two metric tons of 'plot' (read: frustratingly unfocused dialog mostly involving things unrelated to giant, warring robots) standing between the viewer and every decent action scene? This is bloody >>Transformers<< not Days of our Lives. Make with the intergalactic robot battles already.Sorry, but after the ridiculously awesome introduction I was all charged up for action-film history. Instead the movie stops... dead... for over an hour, while minute after long minute is spend developing countless characters who all somehow still come off as one-note and hollow.Toss in a painfully lame slapstick sequence set in the main character's back yard (I don't buy the 'it's a kid's movie' defense. Nobody young enough to think that scene is funny would have made it past the brutal introduction without bursting into tears.) and you've got a disappointing mess of a Blockbuster.I recommend borrowing the DVD from your friend, watching the opening Middle East sequence, then hitting 'stop' and going to do something else.",3,2,6,12 January 2008
The Dark Knight," It all just fits
","What makes the Dark Knight special in the (very large) pantheon of action-blockbusters is the way it all fits together.Here we have a very large, very dense two-villain comic-book story told in such a smooth, inter-related way that when the second villain finally emerges it feels entirely natural, as if that character could exist in no other way.We have the anarchist-Joker, who could have been a typically psychotic antagonist, taken to such a surreal extreme that he jumps right over 'crazy' and lands on 'evil.' Yet the character never seems artificial or one-note. This Joker comes from nowhere, seemingly fully formed, an all-powerful super-villain, almost omniscient, practically teleporting, seemingly invincible, and still he somehow feels like a real person.The film's main theme is terrorism, a rather thin-ice topic, but its approached in an honest and non-judgmental way that I found tremendously refreshing. Nothing is heavy-handed or preachy, nor is there any clear moral or conclusion. The thematic elements are subtle but present, and you the viewer are left to construct your own message, which is exactly how it should be done in a film aimed at adults.But it's still a blockbuster, and that's right too. Steps are taken to bring realism to Batman's world, but the character's comic-book origins are not forgotten or discarded. Batman and the Joker are, without explanation, super-powered, which is after all what we came to see.If there's any real flaw it's that the action scenes are rather ho-hum compared to the drama. Only the car chase is memorable (despite being confusing spatially) and even that wouldn't make anyone's top-5. That this weakness isn't more disastrous (or even particularly consequential) in an action film shows just how good the whole really is.Because in the end, it all just clicks. You get the feeling that what you watched was complete, and that nothing could or should have been different. Of course it's not perfect -- nothing is -- but fewer mistakes were made here than in any other action movie I can think of. This is what all blockbusters should aspire to be.",9,2,7,19 March 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Significant improvement over the first
","Transformers 2 is basically what I was hoping Transformers 1 would be. Giant robots fighting.Lots and lots and lots of robots. Giant ones. Fighting. Constantly.If that's what you want, that's what you get, and you'll leave happy.Beyond that, the movie walks a weird line between quality and crap.The fights are frequently stunning and exhilarating, especially at an iMax. On the other hand, the confusing robo-thrashing shots remain, and calling the climactic action scene 'overdone' is a cosmic understatement.The human characters are much more likable than they were in T1, and the time we spend with them is more entertaining. Shia and Megan can both actually act. Well! I'd even go so far as to call Shia excellent. Sadly, the ill-conceived ghettobots deeply damage the film's credibility with their shameful, unfunny Jar-Jaring.The plot is simple and focused on driving the action from one fight to the next. To me this is enormously preferable to the endless, pointless politicking of the first film. On the other hand, it's still really silly stuff, and the plot holes are so frequent and enormous that you basically just start ignoring them.So ultimately, Transformers 2 is a success of comparability. It's better than the first. It's better than your average blockbuster. It's smarter than you might expect but dumber than you might want.But remember: it's a movie about warring robots! And it does that better than any other movie I can think of.",5,2,7,27 June 2009
Inception," Misses a bulls-eye so narrowly that it hurts
","A lot has been written about this film already so I won't repeat the obvious. It is, overall, a very good movie. But it has a big problem.The emotional core of Inception is DiCaprio's character and his 'relationship' with his wife, Mal. Whenever the movie is telling that story it's fantastic. Whenever it's not, it's not.The end result is a mostly-great movie with about 45 minutes of unnecessary explosions stapled on.The ultra-generic action sequences (with one notable, Matrix-esquire exception that ends much too quickly) are tiring and unexciting, and show a distinct lack of imagination. The Dark Knight demonstrated that this otherwise-gifted director has trouble building coherent/engaging action scenes, but the gimmicky nature of the Batman franchise made it forgivable. In Inception that failing takes center stage since the last 45 minutes demand almost non-stop action that Nolan is frankly unable to deliver. Placed beside The Matrix, or even this-year's Kick-Ass, the snowy final battle in Inception is downright boring and threatens to bring the film to an anti-climax. Fortunately the resolution of DiCaprio's storyline is fantastically engaging and brings the rest of the movie up with it.I wonder if Nolan is wasting his considerable story-telling talents working in a genre he doesn't love. This man does not want to film action; it's obvious. Maybe he should just stop trying and focus on telling the tales he wants to tell instead.",8,3,7,19 July 2010
WALL·E," Beautiful and Endearing / Unfocused and Wasteful
","Wall-E is an achievement for many reasons. But Wall-E is not perfect. And honestly, I think Wall-E is quite overrated.I'll start with the good: The CG is revolutionary. Our two mostly-speechless heroes (essentially a rolling square and a floating circle) are the most likable on-screen duo in recent memory. Their romance is believable and endearing, and any time they're interacting with each other the movie is a 10. The film's first 45 minutes are positively enchanting.Unfortunately, as soon as the pair leaves Earth everything stops clicking.In the second 2/3rds of the movie, the storyline stops focusing on the romance and starts zig-zagging between what seems like 5 or 6 barely-related sub-plots. During all this unfocused side-story hopping the writers somehow forget to include a MAIN story of any consequence. This is a serious problem.Secondary characters are introduced, then dropped, then reappear an hour later to overcome some obstacle that clearly only existed to give them something to do. So why introduce them? A villain appears about half-way through the movie, paired with a human hero who will be inevitably tasked to defeat him. But the villain is non-threatening and the hero is under-developed and unbelievable, and when his triumph finally comes it feels anti-climactic and forced.The various 'sub-plots' should really be described as 'sub-points,' since they're all transparent vehicles for social/political messages. Upwards of 4 different morals are bandied about, but the writers don't seem particularly passionate about any of them and don't devote more than 5 minutes to any single topic. The Incredibles, Ratatouille and even Happy Feet are all examples of how to marry a moral to a plot without diminishing either. Wall-E is an example of how not to.In the end, I can't shake the feeling that Pixar took a simple, beautiful movie about robot romance and environmental caution, and crammed in two metric-tons of unnecessary, half-baked fluff. As a huge Pixar fan I have to say: they're better than that.Sorry Pixar. I still love you.",8,18,64,11 July 2008
