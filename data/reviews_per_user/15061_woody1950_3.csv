Changeling," What a horrible movie!
","I do not understand how either viewers or professional reviewers could be so kind to this movie! I thought that it was one of the worst I've seen in a long time. Full of bad acting (the performances of the child actors were particularly awful) and soap-opera quality melodrama, this movie was a total disaster. Did Eastwood get a pass from reviewers because he's old and respected? That's the only possibility I can imagine. This movie looks like a TV melodrama with its hand-held camera work and TV quality sound.The story is over-the-top and the acting is just silly. Really, sometimes I wonder what IMDb users are thinking when they give out these high ratings!",2,10,17,15 June 2012
Knives Out," Very entertaining
","I don't understand the negative reviews for this movie. The dialog was brilliant. The cast was extraordinary. The setting was perfect and the plot was tight. I have no idea how people can claim to have been bored with this movie. Maybe some of the reviews are driven by politics, not esthetics.",8,1,2,11 May 2020
Gone Girl," Really, really bad
","Some of the worst dialog I've ever seen in a movie. Bad story, flat acting. The critics who gave this good reviews should find other work.I read the book, so I know what the story was supposed to be. This disjointed telling does no credit to the book.I can't imagine how the director managed to get such terrible performances out of experienced actors. It's a real credit to bad directing. The only character who really clicks is the sister. Affleck looks like they already paid him, and he's ready to go home.This movie had absolute no emotional impact. The characters were too flat and the dialog too unrealistic to have any effect. The storyline was poorly conceived.The mostly positive reviews for this movie demonstrate, once again, how most people are not very observant or discerning about what they watch.",1,15,27,18 March 2015
