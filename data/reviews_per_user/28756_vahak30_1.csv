Come and See," WAR, a psychological game of oppression and conflict.
","Elem Kulimov's thriller about war and human conflict is definitely a movie that will stick with the viewer undoubtedly forever. Usually war movies are done in either tow ways, one being the 'Saving Private Ryan,' way of glory, valor, and determination; or in this case a more realistic and often actual representation of war, depression, despair, and hopelessness. The movie does a magnificent job at demonstrating the human psyche and outlook on life when war is upon one's country, the agony and distress shown by the protagonist (Aleksei Kravchenko) throughout the movie makes you cringe at every new scene. This movie in particular has such profound imagery that often times just a few seconds of frame at a particular image, (the back of the village) are enough to tell the entire story of both the people and the true nature of war itself. I felt that I was somehow being tormented throughout the movie, uneasy, moving around in my seat, in utter disbelief and disgust, realizing that the movie has almost direct parallels with actualities the war had. Klimov does an excellent job displaying the psychological effects of war on Floyra. The use of music excerpts fits perfectly with the movie. The moment the Nazis bomb the area Florya was first stationed we hear this deafening noise, we feel the emotions and feel like we are almost under attack ourselves. If an individual wants to see a movie where the true elements and identity of war is depicted, look no further than this, Come and See the true nature of the beast!",9,1,1,9 February 2011
