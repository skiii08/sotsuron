Mission: Impossible III," An Entertaining Action Flick with a Great Villain.
","I went to see M:i:III over the weekend expecting an entertaining action flick, and it delivered. This adrenaline rush of a film will keep you entertained from start to finish with little flaws.Personally, I think the Mission: Impossible sequels fell far from the original. But where M:i:2 lacked in originality it made up for it in explosives. What M:i:3 lacked in originality it made up for with Philip Seymour Hoffman.The first time I *noticed* Hoffman was when he portrayed the annoying reporter Freddy Lounds in 'Red Dragon'. But looking back on the roles he has played through the 90's till now, he has proved he can play any role, not just well, but magnificently.Rarely does an actor deliver the intensity that he did as a villain. This film is centered around Tom Cruise's character 'Ethan Hunt' but the true star is Philip Seymour Hoffman as 'Owen Davian'.Overall: 7/10",7,0,1,8 May 2006
Wedding Crashers," Wedding Crashers too funny
","I went to see Wedding Crashers expecting to see a funny movie. What I got was something much better. It was jam packed with appropriate (and inappropriate) jokes, the lead up to 'the' wedding crash is just long enough to entertain and reveal a little character in both Wilson and Vaughn.While Owen Wilson puts on a performance of slightly higher caliber than in his previous films, Vince Vaughn is at his best in this film. Almost every line out of his mouth sends the audience into huge belly laughs.I'd love to say more, but I don't like making reviews that contains spoilers.My Recommendation? Fill a couple of car loads of your closest friends and go see Wedding Crashers. As a university student with exams soon pressing, this was a great 2 hours of entertainment before I start exams.",9,0,1,30 July 2005
