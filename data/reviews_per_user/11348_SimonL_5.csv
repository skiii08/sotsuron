Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Pantom Menace
","The prospect of yet another Star Wars film does not fill me with new hope. To give credit where it's due, the fourth episode, or original film, was quite entertaining, though it started to meander half way through. The other episodes, especially the first went downhill from there. Just think of the Batman/Lethal Weapon franchises; the first instalments were fantastic, but the others have been quite appalling. Back to Star Wars, and it seemed that for the recent film, George Lucas was carried away by the developments in SFX and CGI. Can anyone explain what Jar Jar Binks was actually for? He wasn't funny and did nothing for the narrative. What a waste of time, money and effort. Also, I think we've seen enough laser battles in our time to become quite annulled to more, so the climax to the film didn't satisfy. Probably the best thing about The Phantom Menace was Darth Mual, but we won't be seeing any more of him. Obviously the second film in the series will be a worldwide hit, swelling the coffers of George Lucas and studio executives, but is it deserved? I think the format of Star Wars is wearing thin, and it is now more about marketing and merchandise than the art and craft of film-making, but what do I know? I'm only a film student, just as Lucas was once.",Null,0,1,10 May 2000
The Exorcist," BBC's Ghostwatch vs Exorcist
","During Halloween night of 1992, the BBC showed a programme called 'Ghostwatch'. Having seen the Exorcist in 1994 and after reading all the hype about its re-release now, I would just like to point out that Ghostwatch scared me far more than the Exorcist did. Although I admire the Exorcist's reputation as a horror classic, I can't quite bring myself to say it was as scary as most people have made out. To be honest I found the film to be rather tired and slow, the only notable feature being the special effects used to convey the possession of Regen. While Ghostwatch created a 'War of the Worlds' scenario to some people, including me at the tender age of 16, the Exorcist did little to raise my pulse.",Null,0,0,7 November 1998
Schindler's List," A Masterpiece
","Schindler's List is truly one of the most thought provoking films of the decade. Before seeing this film, I knew nothing about the horrors of the Holocaust, and to be honest, I wish that were still the case.I cannot believe the sheer brutality of the Germans for committing such horrific acts on the Jews. Just because a person has a different religion or race to our own, does that give us any right to crucify them or make them feel less human?With regards to the film, expert performances, especially from Neeson, Kingsley and Feinnes, combined with the superb cinematography of Janusz Kaminski and direction of Spielberg make Schindler's List an enduring, although disturbing, masterpiece.",Null,9,13,18 November 1998
The Shawshank Redemption," Great Film. Why no Oscar?
","This is one of the best films of all time, and I'm not kidding you. Yes, you're welcome to your Godfathers' and Citizen Kanes' but this is a film everybody can experience, preferably through the medium of cinema, for what it is, a truly great story, backed up by top notch performances by Robbins and Freeman.Everyone I have ever spoken to has enjoyed this film and they were as surprised as me to find out that although nominated, the film did not receive one single Oscar. Why is it so, that a good film like Forrest Gump can win so many but a truly great film like Shawshank wins nothing?Words cannot describe how great this film is, one to see again and again, and not just for the triumphant twist at its conclusion! Watch it!!",10,0,1,17 November 1998
The Truman Show," Best of '98
","In a time when Hollywood is producing 혩popcorn fodder' movies that cater for the lowest common denominator, it's very refreshing to see an intelligent film that works on so many different levels.The Truman Show is just such a film. On a basic level, we have a serious Jim Carrey film, which deals with deception and creation. But though watching this film we find that it is so much more than that. We have elements of humour, satire and quite a few jabs at present day media practices, i.e. turning 혩ordinary' people into celebrities, through the medium of television, evident in British shows such as Airport and Hotel.This is done on a much grander scale though, with all Truman's life being turned into a television show. What interests me most about this film is the way in which the 5000+ cameras are represented on screen that film Truman on a day-to-day basis, and how products are plugged 혩on air'.In my opinion, ranking up alongside 혩Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' as one of best films of 1998, The Truman Show will soon become regarded as a modern classic.",9,0,0,18 November 1998
