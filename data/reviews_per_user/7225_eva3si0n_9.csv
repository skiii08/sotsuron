Skyfall," Best film in the series
","Skyfall is the best film in the series if you sort out the series after it restarted in 2006. Here is a dearly interesting and confusing plot, after the boring Quantum of Solace. And clearly there is a change in the course of the franchise, the addition of new characters and it is worth noting that Ralph Fiennes stands out vividly for his excellent acting. And the film finally ends without happy end.",9,0,2,28 April 2020
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Dead Man 's Chest is a typical sequel
","Dead Man 's Chest is a typical sequel. It turned out to be much weaker than the original. In it of course action scenes are brought to a new level, CGI for 2006 is generally magnificent, even in 2020 looks worthy. But here the script significantly sat in the production and development of characters. And the absence of a worthy ending is annoying. I understand that Pirates of the Caribbean was originally conceived as a trilogy, but it is impossible to complete films like this.",7,0,0,10 June 2020
Scary Movie 2," Typical sequel
","Scary Movie 2 is not a good sequel. The sequel turned out almost worse in everything, but the crack here is still enough. And the plot (or its likeness) is not enough, because by the middle of the film it ends. Very much on a big amateur film, which you won 't say about the first film.",4,0,0,25 May 2020
Quantum of Solace," Weakest and most boring movie in Agent 007 series after restart
","Quantum of Solace is the weakest and most boring film in a series of films since its restart in 2006. There is no well-prescribed antagonist here, and the hero Mathieu Amalric does not pull on it in any way. And the plot does not shine originality, the single thing that is remembered in the film, it is the companion of agent Olga Kurylenko.",6,1,2,28 April 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," One of the best films of 2019
","One of the best films of 2019. I love Tarantino 's films when you watch his film immediately it becomes clear that he made it. By me so the action of the film is slightly stretched, but the ending is just the best I saw in 2019. When comparing 'Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood 'with the director 's other films you realize that this is not his most outstanding film. But the picture itself seemed so light and bright that it feels like Tarantino was shooting it to relax. Unfortunately my initial expectations have been somewhat overstated, so I can 't call this film the best in 2019.",8,2,6,18 June 2020
1917," One of the best films in 2019
","1917 great military drama. There is no pseudogeroity and a lot of patriotic speeches. The story is simple and quite real. And while as in Dunkirk the true enemy is not very often shown, the film keeps in tension throughout time. Yeah, operator 's work, it 's better than what 's in the movie. Made just fine, one of the best films of 2019.",9,0,1,27 April 2020
Inside Man," Not a bad thriller about one robbery
","Not a bad thriller about one robbery. Like most such films in this genre, the film is chamber, because of this, acting is very important. But here it is not enough, there is also no properly built suspense. You can see it 1 time, but the film will be forgotten in a couple of days because of its triviality.",6,1,1,13 June 2020
Casino Royale," The first film in the restart of the series about Agent 007
","The first film in the restart of the series about Agent 007 turned out not to be bad, but definitely not one of the best in the series. The action is too stretched yes and the plot is rolling slowly. The double ending certainly does not look bad, though here the film showed a little creativity. Cast really not bad, yes Mads Mikkelsen",7,0,1,27 April 2020
Identity," Identity is a vivid example of a well-staged thriller
","Identity is a vivid example of a well-staged thriller in which suspense is injected consistently and correctly. Here is a rather simple plot, but the presence of a hidden second ending in the film changes everything. Yes, a good cast gathered here and there are a couple of competently placed twists. But the main thing in the film is that it is essentially chamber. Namely, chamber makes the thriller especially exciting. Even knowing the ending of the film and reviewing it after 5-7 years, you can understand that there are not many films like Identity. There are many good chamber films, even more high-quality thrillers, but there are not so many good chamber thrillers.",9,0,0,20 June 2020
