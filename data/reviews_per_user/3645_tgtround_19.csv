The Devil's Advocate," Rubbish
",As Halliwell's Film Guide says - 'seems to be designed to give Pacino the opportunity to overact - which he accepts with relish.'Tyalor Hackford should be ashamed if he thinks the cinema going public should pay to see tripe like this.,2,7,18,14 July 2000
Training Day," Excellent Study of Moral Ambiguities
",An excellent effort - both Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke (who I was previously a bit dubious about) give stellar performances.There is some of the flavour of LA Confidential in the film's study of moral ambiguities and the nature of corruption.,8,0,10,21 February 2002
Erin Brockovich," Mass Production Chewing Gum for the Eyes
","I know that people are desperate for entertaining cinema which is slightly more stretching then Mission Impossible 2, but this isn't it.Julia Roberts struggles very beautifully, whilst always appearing exactly like a multi-millionairess pretending to be poor and her performance has all the depths of a puddle. In her scenes with Albert Finney she looks like a cardboard cut-out.As for the story itself - we SHOULD be asking why no-one faced criminal charges, since all sueing a company does is pass the costs on to the consumer :-) And by the way, it's not an act of heroism to be an ambulance chasing lawyer - they have an interest too.",4,1,4,6 September 2000
Inglourious Basterds," I Must Have Missed A Meeting
","I guess I must have missed a meeting. I fail to see how a boring, badly edited mess that goes on way too long and has a centre more boggy than the pitch at Turf Moor has been lauded with praise.Sure - Quentin has great technical control and the film features some fine acting in places but it's no excuse for a total lack of narrative drive.In old Hollywood, he would have been told to cut the film by an hour and get on with the story but sadly length and spectacle now appear to be equated with great films.On the whole I would rather have been watching 'Who Dares Wins' for a laugh.",2,6,10,11 December 2009
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," A Journey Through Tourist Board Cliche
","Sadly, despite the people involved this is as much 'Hollywood does World War 2' as anything produced in the last 20 years. The list of cliches is endless, but includes:1) All Germans are humourless bastards. 2) All Italians love life and singing. 3) We're supposed to believe that the same Italian soldiers are garrisoned on Cephallonia for two years - while the Italian Army fights a war in North Africa against the allies and is also committed to fighting the Soviet Union alongside Hitler. 4) We're also supposed to accept the Italian Army as heroes, somehow overlooking all of the atrocities committed during the campaigns in Ethiopia and Albania. 5) a man somehow manages to survive a hail of bullets which kill all of his comrades ...and so on ...Romance 10, History 0 (Sadly in extra time)",4,2,4,8 May 2001
The English Patient," An Absolute Barrel of Utter Tripe
","An abysmal shocker of a picture which whilst displaying an utter lack of soul also makes a ham-fisted interpretation of the book.Overall, is has the beautiful look of a pop video made on a massive budget and all the soul and plot of a hayfever relief commercial.",1,9,20,21 November 2000
Crash," How Many Clich√©s Can you Get in One Movie?
","About one every two minutes judging by this star-studded utter mess of a movie. I personally have nothing against a complex narrative structure but I do have a big problem with 2-dimensional characters presented like Kubuki theatre as some kind of in-depth exploration of modern racial relations.Given that this is supposed to be an 'adult' film then a lack of anything approaching subtlety is unforgivable - everything is signposted like a freeway exit In modern life, overt racism is not the most pressing issue - it very rarely comes straight out and introduces itself. The kind of racism we have now is more sinister - it's what goes unsaid that matters. This film kind-of misses the point.",4,17,27,25 April 2006
The Beach," Mediocre in the extreme
","Laughably, Leonardo Di Caprio turned down American Psycho to make this film with the makers of Trainspotting.The conversion of the main character from English to American JUST DOESN'T WORK. The american character has too much of a Can-Do mentality and isn't nearly cynical enough.And the plot is full of holes too. Oh, and sharks don't attack humans very often, either.",4,0,1,14 July 2000
The Bourne Identity," How a Thriller Should Be!
","Robert Ludlum's first Bourne novel is translated into a post-Soviet world to dazzling effect. Ludlum himself helped the translation to the screen just before he died and is on record as throughly approving the result. And why on earth shouldn't he? Despite a clearly limited budget, Doug Liman delivers an excellently paced , gripping espionage thriller which makes recent Bond films look like the flacid tripe they have often been.Matt Damon is truly a revelation and proves that an articulate, intelligent actor can do an action movie with great conviction. His screen relationship with his co-star Franke Potente is a joy to watch and one of the strengths of the film.",9,0,1,23 September 2006
Saving Private Ryan," Extraordinarily Over-Rated
","I can't believe that this film currently rates on IMDB higher than both Paths of Glory and Platoon. The latter is one of the best anti-war films ever made - by a man WHO WAS ACTUALLY THERE.Speilberg's technical mastery may be great but his characters are cardboard and his understanding of men's motivation's is fatally flawed. As Oliver Stone recognises in Platoon, soldiers fight for one another not a great cause. As the Platoon Sergeant says in Hamburger Hill regarding the death of one of the men: 'He died taking out that automatic weapon for you and third squad - and don't you give him anything less.'",5,4,8,15 February 2001
The Insider," Excellent Conspiracy Thriller
","An excellent treatment of a subject that's difficult to make dramatic.Both Pacino and Russell Crowe are excellent, and Michael Mann manages to keep the tension up and still show us his distinctive style. There is a scene where Lowell Bergman ends a phone call up to his waist in the sea on a beautiful beach - that's pure Michael Mann, just see Manhunter is you don't believe me.",9,0,0,14 July 2000
Pride & Prejudice," Save yourself the money and buy the BBC series
","There is much to enjoy in this adaptation of Austen but Keira Knightley is not one of them. A fine production with great colour, great music and some outstanding actors the heart of the story is let down by the lead performance and the MTV camera-work.While Macfadyen gives a performance as Darcy which is within a shout as good as Colin Firth Keira is an over-hyped lightweight with so little gravitas that she just can't carry the film. It feels like Frank Lampard has been replaced in Chelsea's midfield by a youth trainee.Save yourself the bother and buy the BBC series of the 1990s on DVD instead.",5,7,15,21 October 2005
Inside Man," Hiest Movie Cum Paranoid Conspiracy Thriller
","What on earth has happened to Spike Lee? He livened up the 1980s and 1990s with sharp, sassy films on a wide variety of subjects. Now he's just beginning to look like a bitter has-been with a wide variety of prejudices which he likes to spread to a wider audience.As a film, there are many enjoyable moments from a stellar cast including the ever-watchable Clive Owen and Denzel Washington. (In my opinion no film with Denzel is ever an entire waste of your hard-earned as the man has such presence and charisma).However, beyond that the plot start out implausible and descends into the totally unbelievable. It's like a cardboard box left out in the rain - it starts out looking like it's got a structure but after a while it's just a sodden mess. Key protagonists (particularly Owen's character) have no background or apparent motivation.Overall, a superficially well-made film is let down by flimsy material and lazy direction.",5,2,5,15 April 2006
Inception," Our Minds Can Imagine Anything - Apart From An Original Ending Apparently
","Well that's a pointless 2 hours and 33 minutes of my life I'm not getting back.The praise lavished on this movie is more indicative of the lack of any originality at all today in Hollywood rather than the qualities of the movie itself.Great as the concept is Philip K Dick came up with much more outlandish ideas that he just wrote up as short stories and novels forty years ago - many of them having proved impossible for the movie business to translate even with modern imagery.Don't get me wrong, the images along the way and performances are outstanding but the trite 'Are we still dreaming?' ending is unoriginal and actually just hollows the entire film. I also guessed it from about ten minutes in. By the end I frankly couldn't have cared less.",6,4,7,8 August 2010
The Queen," A Great Film About An Extraordinary Week
",No one above the age of about five in 1997 will forget the week that Princess Diana died. Never outside war time has Britain been in such an obvious state of collective shock. Whether you feel that this event was absurd (as some including myself do) or not you can't deny it happened.Stephen Frears has chosen to dramatize that week to question the role of the monarchy and it proves to make a brilliant film. I personally think that the most impressive portrayal is of Tony Blair - the youngest Prime Minister of the 20th Century at the peak of his political grasp and influence. The film does not hesitate to underline that this was a rare occasion when a politician really understood the public mood and was rightly commended for his leadership.The other major portrayal - of our Captain General Queen Elizabeth is very good but I don't think Helen Mirren is really stiff enough! She's just a bit too twinkly eyed to successfully play a woman who has been guarded in public for 50 years. Anyone doubting this should watch the footage of Rolf Harris painting her portrait - vanilla ice cream is less frosty.,10,1,2,6 October 2006
Any Given Sunday," A Great Football Movie
","Not since North Dallas Forty has a film director tried to dissect America's second favourite and probably most risk-laden sport.The action scenes are stunning - staged in a style which brings the rush far more than any NFL film.While the story is potentially a bit of a cliche, Pacino turns in the normal convincing performance, but the real surprise of the film is Cameron Diaz as the daughter of the late owner, who definitely shows she's not just a pretty face. Jamie Foxx is excellent as the upstart young quarterback (and he sings well too!).All in all, I feel lucky to have seen a film which wasn't shown much in Britain because of its subject and am impressed with Stone's treatment of a game which is fascinating and so ugly at the same time.",9,1,2,14 July 2000
Trainspotting," A Stunning Trip Into The Underbelly of Britain
","Having read the book I can honestly say this is a very good translation into film - though it does provide a very commercial narrative unlike the book, which is more like a series of anecdotes.A very big advance in film-making from Shallow Grave, the same team now seem to have gone backwards with The Beach - which sucks in many ways.",9,0,1,5 September 2000
Speed," You'll believe a bus can fly!
",A ludicrously plotted and badly acted movie. Gives Dennis Hoppper another excellent opportunity to play an over-acting psycho persona and was yet another nail in the coffin of Jeff Daniels career.Keanu Reeves has all the engaging screen presence of a highway sign - but he has got a nice body :-),3,7,18,14 July 2000
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Another Great Trip To Coen Land
","Part fantasy, part very calculated sideswipe at the politics of the Southern United States, the film takes us on an odyssey.Just like Homer's original, the end isn't nearly as important as the journey itself.All of the performances are good, particularly George Clooney - who should have been born earlier - Clarke Gable wouldn't have stood a chance.",9,0,0,29 September 2000
