Iron Man 3," Very entertaining
","Spoiler! somewhat... What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said, it was an enthralling movie viewing experience from the very beginning of the movie. Only thing that didn't make too much sense plot wise was why didn't he call his avenger friends such as Captain America for help? Nick Fury? I can see that Iron Man contacting Thor, Hulk, could prove to be unwieldy since Thor lives in space, whilst Hulk is furtively sojourning in third world countries. I say this because this movie felt like a sequel to Avengers 2 rather than Iron Man 2. In Iron man 3, Iron man suffers from insomnia as well as anxiety attacks due to his endeavoring of saving Earth with his Avenger buddies in New York,it traumatized him, and this mental disposition is an integral part of his character make up in this movie, if not for this I would not have been compelled to make the connections, but since his mentally precarious state was conspicuously apparent from the very beginning of the movie I thought Avenger superhero would invariably make a cameo appearance and leave an indelible impression on viewers by assisting Iron Man, this just seemed very unrealistic, at any rate, it is certainly the most entertaining movie I have seen thus far this year.",7,0,4,29 April 2013
