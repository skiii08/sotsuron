Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," One Word: Stupid -- OK, a second word: juvenile
","This movie is fine if you're into 4th grade humor. You can see that from the voting stats -- the highest vote for this movie comes from IMDb members younger than 18 yrs.I'm not saying that I did not laugh at some things -- such as the old joke of mistaking 'retired' for 'retarded' -- I laugh at it every time I hear it -- but that doesn't make it a good joke. It is indicative of the quality of the entire movie though. I'm really disappointed by the lack clever and thought out humor in this movie. In the end, you realize that the only clever joke in the entire movie is the one it pulled on the audience -- it got them to spend $10 on something that Borat dangles in a plastic bag in front of his dinner host.This movie would be fine if it showed up as a free download on YouTube, but come on -- $10 for this? Waste of money.If you really really want to see it, wait for it to show up on cable -- believe me, you're not missing much till then.",1,13,28,20 November 2006
