The Blair Witch Project," Allow yourself to be freaked....
","I saw this movie on the opening day at 1:45 in the afternoon in a sold-out theater in an audience of college film students. Okay...you know what? I was scared. Yes, I realize how some people could definitely be disappointed in this film. It's a low-budget movie with great ideas and minimal resources...but I thought that it was GREAT. It's a BRILLIANT concept. Now that the film is becoming more and more hyped, I KNOW that there is going to be some serious backlash about this film not being scary enough...but I've just got to say: ALLOW yourself to be sucked into the idea...you're lost in the middle of the woods...you hear voices and screaming outside of your tent...you get progressively more hungry, tired, and frantic as the days wear on and you lose hope...it's SCARY!!! I think that the best part of this film is the way in which we get to see these three characters just absolutely LOSE IT. Now, granted, sitting in a movie theater surrounded by tons of people, knowing that I would be able to go out into the bright sunlight when the movie was over....yes, that makes the movie less scary. But the point for me was just the fact that these three kids just completely lose their minds and their humanity in the middle of the woods. Just think about it...these three kids disappear and then a year later you find their footage: it's not about scary stick figures hanging in trees or creepy voices in the middle of the night. It's about three kids completely losing their humanity and desperately searching for ANYTHING to cling to. I thought that the ending was terrifying. And I thought that it was terrifying not only due to the creepy situation they find themselves in at the end of the movie...but even more so because these kids were just sick with terror and had lost all hope!!! It's great! Go see it! ALLOW yourself to be sucked in and THINK ABOUT IT!!! I give it 8 out of 10.",8,1,3,19 July 1999
Changeling," So horrifically Depressing It's Hard to Be Objective
","Clint Eastwood is a great director and Angelina Jolie does some of her best work in this film, but the action of the film itself is so horrible that it's hard to believe that anyone could actually 'enjoy' the film. It's not bad enough that Christine Collins loses her son, and then gets a fake son, she's also committed to the county psychiatric hospital, and then we're treated to several scenes in which a psychopathic child serial killer slaughters dozens. I have to admit that I was really surprised that this story isn't more famous in contemporary culture. It's absolutely horrifying. The element of the film that I liked the best was the constant reference to the total corruption and incompetence of the LAPD. Some things never change.",5,1,6,7 March 2009
Requiem for a Dream," One of 'THOSE' Movies
","This is one of 'those' movies,.... Like 'Basketball Diaries' or 'Primal Fear,' that made me feel like vomiting for a couple of days afterwards. This film is BEAUTIFULLY directed, written, acted, filmed,...It's just something that III would recommend watching when you're ALREADY feeling seriously suicidal, because that's how you're going to feel after you watch the film.",Null,0,0,19 June 2001
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Jar Jar Stinks.
","Yo-OK. I know we've all said it before, but Jar Jar was obnoxious, annoying, distracting and unnecessary. I really liked this film, especially the evil little robot droids. And ESPECIALLY the little guy who said 'OOOO-TEEE-DEE!!' Nice! But Jar Jar got in the way of some great storylines. I found myself getting into a scene and praying that JJ wouldn't pop up again to screw things up, but he always did. I don't know about everyone else, but I prefer the little Jim Henson muppet guys in the first three Star Wars to the cheesy computer animation. Computer animation is fake and annoying!!! Overall, I had a lot of fun though! Yes, this film is really just a big set up for the next two, but it was a GREAT set up!!! How many years do we have to wait for the next one? Three? Ugh!",5,0,1,24 May 1999
Erin Brockovich," This film makes me HAAAAPPPPYYY!!!
","This is one of those movies that I just KNOW that I'm going to end up watching about 500 TIMES. That's just because it's so,...well,...WATCHABLE. I'm REALLY not a fan of Julia Roberts,...and I think I've only enjoyed MAYBE one of her other films, but this one is TERRIFIC. It's inspiring AND funny AND entertaining AND well-written,...AND--I say that the Oscar nomination in THIS one's GOT to go to Albert Finney. He's absolutely hysterical. This is just one of those movies that makes me HAPPY. Hooray!!!",9,0,1,27 November 2000
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," I have NO idea what happened in this movie!
","Let me start by saying I didn't read the book, and didn't know I wouldn't be able to understand the movie without it. But, I DIDN'T understand the movie!About 45 minutes, the person I was with leaned over and asked me if I knew what was going on. All I knew was: 'There's a mole I think?'I truly had no idea what was going on. I also had no idea who the characters were or why I was supposed to care about them, but the plot confusion trumped that for sure. I left after 90 minutes so I could go home and look up a summary on the internet because I was going nuts. Several people around me were sleeping and I saw one other person walk out as well, but I see that the film is getting fantastic reviews. It just made me real, real sleepy.",4,20,38,26 December 2011
Footloose," Hot....white hot...
","There is no doubt about it, this film is pure cheese.You absolutely must see this film if only for the unbelievable scene in which Kevin Bacon 'works out some emotions' in the warehouse. The soundtrack is fierce! Let's hear it for the boy??? This film is what the 80s were all about.",5,23,53,31 May 1999
Cast Away," This movie,...SUCKS.
","Okay,...let me start with the POSITIVES--I liked the plane crash. I mean,...that was good,...but the second he got on dry land, I found myself wishing that he'd drowned along with the plane. Tom Hanks is a BEAST. It's not JUST the pathetic acting that made me hate this movie,...it's the script. This movie had the potential to be really interesting and profound...but then just as Hanks' character starts to settle in on the island, there's a blackout and suddenly the screen says: '4 Years Later'.Um,...FOUR YEARS LATER??? Then,...why the hell did I come to see this movie??? So that I could see him reunite with rat-face Helen Hunt. Um,...okkaaayyy. Except that the reunion between the two is PATHETIC. The scriptwriters tried to pack the ENTIRE process of shock, grieving, reignited love, and realization that each of them had 'moved on' into TEN MINUTES.What a load.The ending is so cheesy it hurt. And the imagery throughout the film is so blatant that it's insulting.
They just skipped over EVERY SINGLE SCENE that I was interested in seeing.This movie's a STEAMER.",1,25,66,17 January 2001
American Beauty," A Mediocre Satire
","Okay,...it's not that I didn't LIKE this film....I mean,...it was FINE. It's a decent film, but the fact that it got as much praise and as many accolades as it did is really ridiculous and offensive to me. If the 'draw' of this film is supposed to be that it goes 'out on the edge' and gets to the heart of a 'typical American suburban family',...then I personally just don't get it. I didn't find this film to be revolutionary or new at all. There have been DOZENS of films out there that have covered this topic and covered it beautifully and with more thought.     I love Kevin Spacey. I think that he's a wonderful actor and he's the entire reason that I didn't hate this film completely. Without him, it would've been a REAL steaming load. But other than Spacey's performance, I HONESTLY don't understand what all of the fuss is about. I would love to respond to what people love about this film, but I HONESTLY don't get it. It wasn't original or new, the storyline was violently predictable, and the attempts at emotional manipulation of the audience were thinly veiled as what MUST be very personal and emotional experiences for the writer of this film,...but not so much for me as an audience member. I just HONESTLY don't understand why this film was so highly acclaimed when BEAUTIFUL films like:AHEM!'The Insider'were cast aside.I think that it's a SERIOUSLY depressing state of affairs for the American film-going audience when we are reveling in a film such as this for 'showing us the truth'. Please,...",5,1,2,20 April 2000
Man on the Moon," Wicked Mediocre
","I was really pretty disappointed. I absolutely adore Andy Kaufman. I think that he was a genius and undoubtedly one of the greatest comedians of the century. The problem with this movie was that it didn't show me anything that I didn't see on the 'Tribute to Andy Kaufman' 1-hour special on Comedy Central. This movie left me with the feeling that Kaufman was a two-dimensional character with no feelings when he was off-stage. I don't know THAT much about the sequence of events that took place in Kaufman's life, but I do know that Forman manipulated the events to tell a much different story than actually occurred. I was disappointed because it just seemed like an hour and a half of Jim Carrey doing an imitation of the stunts that the real Kaufman pulled in real life. It left me with the feeling the Kaufman was just some freak that was impossible to REALLY KNOW, which I don't believe. Yes, Kaufman was a practical joker and mastered the art of tricking us into who he really was and what he really wanted from us. I saw no passion in this direction. When I see a biographical film, I like to at least think that the director is passionate about the main character's life. I just saw this film as a shallow reflection of the stunts that Kaufman pulled, as opposed to a thoughtful exploration of this brilliant man's life.",5,0,0,6 June 2000
Velvet Goldmine," Fun, sweet, and glamorously brilliant!!!
","I had heard from many that this was a disappointment from Todd Haynes, but I feel that this film really shows his range as a director!  Haynes creates a story that is original, moving, fun, and glamorous. I won't even go off on how HOT the costumes were! Ewan McGregor gives a DIFFERENT and DYNAMIC performance that really gave me a newfound respect for him!",5,2,4,20 May 1999
The Insider," The Best Film of 1999
",The fact that The Insider did not win the Best Picture Oscar just proves how CONSISTENTLY wrong the Academy is. This is a film about TRUTH!!! It's just incredibly disappointing to me how films that explore the depth or REAL LIFE struggles...and how the drama of REAL LIFE can make the absolute most compelling films out there. THIS is the best picture of 1999. And III don't want to hear another word about it!!!,10,0,0,13 April 2000
Life Is Beautiful," I wish everyone could understand.
","I am an extremely cynical moviegoer. I've read the comments of those who 'don't see what the fuss is all about' and I think that that's a tragedy. This is the SWEETEST film I have ever seen. I haven't cried at a movie in about five years, but this film turned me into a blubbering mass of goo. I understand the arguments about the unrealistic concentration camp settings, and they make me want to vomit. For me, this film was about letting go of cynicism and hatred and anger, and seeing the love that one man is capable of, and the arbitrariness of hatred. The very most you can hope for from a film is to find something in the work that helps you to understand and connect with a few in the range of emotions that encompass what it means to be human. Don't put down this film for being 'unrealistic'. It is a beautiful beautiful BEAUTIFUL STORY, and the suspension of disbelief that it asks from the viewer is a VERY small price to pay in exchange for the eloquence of its message.",8,1,2,23 May 1999
A Clockwork Orange," Makes me feel like throwing up,...a lot
","All I can say is that the first time I put this film in my VCR, I ran out of my apartment, and made one of my friends go over to my place and take it out, because I was too scared to touch it. I watched it at HIS place later with LOTS of lights on....Is it a CHICK THING??? This movie just made me want to throw up,...a LOT,... AND it gave me nightmares,... But I know MANY, MANY MAAAAAAAANNNY MEN that think that it's one of the most brilliant films ever made,....I'm not saying it sucked,... I'm just saying that it freaked me out to much to REALLY pay attention to what the movie was trying to 'say.'Maybe when I grow up,...I'll be able to watch it again and be able to appreciate it,...as for now, I don't want to touch it.",Null,1,2,6 June 2001
The Descent," Worst Movie I've Seen in a LONG Time
","I resisted giving this film a 1, because the creepy crawler were kind of scary, but the writing and acting in this film were SO BAD, I wanted to 'punch a baby'. The creepy crawlers were kind of scary at first, but totally laughable after the first couple attacks. The actresses made me WRETCH. Total freakin disaster. Embarrassed that I watched it. I could see that they were trying to say that the chick was just in her own personal hell because her kid died, but the narrative was incredibly sloppy. It was like a junior high school film project. Really budget. And what about her husband? We don't care that HE died? Then why even put him in the car. I got the feeling that there were huge pieces left out of the original story. At the end, the film almost redeemed itself when I thought that Sarah was going to get run over by an 18-wheeler,...but after 100 excruciating minutes, no pay off. BOOOO!",2,1,4,8 November 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Totally Satisfying
","I went to the film PRAYING that I wouldn't be disappointed, and I wasn't! What I loved about this episode is the focus it puts on the psychological torment that Annikan experiences--propelling him to the dark side. I totally bought it. And the acting in this episode? Not half bad! There were a couple of CGI dinosaurs that still looked like crap, but I was able to overlook it and feel totally satisfied with this chapter of the story!!!!!! As YOUNG ANNIKAN would've said in Episode I -'Yiipppppeeeeeee.'That moment that Annikan gets sealed into the suit and breathes that scary Dark Vader respirator breath for the first time?That's hot.",10,2,7,23 May 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," It's just BETTER than other movies...
","Okay,...I just watched this film for probably the 20th time, and I could probably watch it a hundred times in a row and not get sick of it. This comment is directed towards anyone who has not seen this film:                    GO...                    NOW...I have LITERALLY dragged people off the street and sat them down in front of my television when I've found out that they haven't seen this film. And, I have not,...to date...met ANYONE who didn't like this film. There's not really anything bad that you CAN say about it. It's just a beautiful story, beautifully portrayed....     Go...     NOW...",10,0,0,11 January 2000
The Matrix," The Star Wars for our Generation
",The Matrix is just a totally CLASSIC film. The special effects are epic enough to put this film into the history books. It's the fact that there's actually a BRILLIANT story behind it too that makes me feel like this film is really going to be looked on as a classic years from now. This film is LOADED with symbolism and imagery and philosophy and sheer brilliance. This film is WAY ahead of its time. And THIS one was on the first chapter in what's got potential to be THE new great trilogy of our time. It's gonna be OUR Star Wars people!!!  Check it owwwwwttt!!!,10,0,0,11 June 2000
The Thin Red Line," The best film of 1998
","The reason that Terence Malick's 'The Thin Red Line' is so extraordinary is the fact that Malick took HUGE risks in his direction of this film and THEY PAYED OFF. This film is NOT for mass consumption. It is three hours long and extremely heady. But it conveys the terror of war in a way that I have not seen in any other film. Except for John Travolta's ridiculous 5 minute performance towards the beginning of the film, the acting is superb. Malick's use of inner monologues is earth shattering. The film is visually LUSCIOUS. To me, this is what filmmaking is all about. Be warned, this film is completely emotionally and physically draining. But the payoff is that you'll get to experience the most artistically brilliant film of 1998.",10,0,0,30 June 1999
Goodfellas," The perfect film.
","Hey all-I find that most times that I see a film, I always want to tweak some part of it to make it 'just right'. There isn't one thing that I'd like to change about this film. I am disappointed that Ray Liotta's career has completely disintegrated after his amazing performance in this film. I never gave him a second thought until I rented this film about 9 months ago. Don't miss it!!!",10,0,1,19 April 1999
