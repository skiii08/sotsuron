The Blair Witch Project," I just don't see what the fuss was about
","With my ears ringing from praise thrown in the direction of this film I thought I had better check it out. I spent the first half an hour thinking 'It's got to get better soon' and the rest of the film thinking 'What the Hell was all the fuss about?'. I like to think I am open-minded to films slightly out of the ordinary, but have come to the conclusion that this film was just 'Pants'.The Girl's swearing all through the film was rubbish too.",1,2,4,1 October 2001
