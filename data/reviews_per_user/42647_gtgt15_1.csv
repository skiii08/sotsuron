Requiem for a Dream," Truly unforgettable.
","Truly unforgettable. All of the characters have a dream but... the bourne between dream, illusion and obsession is frantically unmarked. Pushed by synthetic urges of the society, you move forward towards your dream but you don't realize the many no-return lines you are crossing.The acting is superb, action has no pauses, the plot is clean and the message is conveyed straight to your hearth together with characters' feelings and, at last, a sense of their true and hopeless dispair.Jennifer Connelly's performance is gorgeous, her perfect beauty being understated by the acting. 10/10",10,0,0,8 March 2003
