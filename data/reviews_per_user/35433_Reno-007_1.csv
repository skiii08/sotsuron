The Incredible Hulk," This has redeemed the character!
","This was a great movie! Edward Norton IS Bruce Banner. The story, FX, acting, music (loved hearing the old tune from the series!) and scenes were great. This is what I expected five years ago when that other monstrosity 'The Hulk' came out. Thankfully I didn't see that flop in the theater and watched it on home video. I remember being so disappointed with the whole movie. Nick Nolte as a drunk wife beating low life and the weird scenes along with the freaked up animals and...well not worth it because it doesn't deserve any space here. This movie is what I expected and more. Doing homage to the old show, i.e. Bill Bixby, Lou Ferigno and the old music was first class. Robert Downey Jr.'s cameo was first rate. Connecting two great films, Iron Man and this was perfect. The humor was done very well along with the drama of the story. Neither was over done and as a result gave just the right balance to make this a very enjoyable film. Spoiler ahead! I'm only removing one star because even though I'm a meat eater I didn't think that killing those two dogs was necessary and will gladly fast forward through those scenes when it comes out on DVD. Otherwise a great film and money well spent!",9,3,6,5 July 2008
