Ford v Ferrari," Nice to see Bale and Damon on screen again!
","It's not too often that we get to see some familiar faces (or names) on any film title released in recent times. A few examples would include Shia Lebouf (A Transformers Actor from the Bayverse) appearing in The Peanut Butter Falcon, Jesse Eisenberg's appearance in the Zombieland Sequel (For the obvious reason that it's been a whole decade since the first one came out), and Ian Mckellen (For the fact that Flushed Away was the last real big film starring Ian Mckellen).But all of that aside, Both Christian Bale and Matt Damon both did exceptionally well portraying both Ford stars that made the GT-40 become the next best thing in Ford Motor Comapny's legacy and popularity. Yet despite the year 1966 for being the second year of the Mustang, the GT-40 was the overall key to victory against Ferrari. The races needed to win were most certainly well-constructed to the point that it acted more like a VR experience than watching an actual race take place.Regardless, however you see this in theaters (Or otherwise), I'd greatly give out a recommendation to this in any way!",8,0,1,28 November 2019
