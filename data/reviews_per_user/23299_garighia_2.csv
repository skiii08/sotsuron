Casablanca," There are very few movies that I can watch over and over;
","Casablanca is the one; it is the only film I ever purchased new.  If you go through life without seeing this movie...well, you didn't have much of one!! Bogart's best movie ever, and the only time I've been crazy for Ingrid Bergman.",10,1,1,30 March 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," On my all time top 10 list
","I have NEVER before gone to a theatre to see a movie 4 times !!!The story was true enough to the book; the casting was marvelous; and visually it was so very well done.I had been worried that the characterizations would not fit my mental pictures well, especially Aragorns; but I was not disappointed one bit.The only problem I found was that it could have been another hour long, at least !",10,1,1,21 February 2002
