Black Swan," Praise of Black Swan by Darren Aronofsky
","First of all, the most interesting thing for me, this story is that the complexity of the films last year (2010) were released in cinemas. Films that have at least part of the general audience to get into trouble and confusion! The first and last time Shutter Island،Inception and Black Swan (Interestingly, this third film in Hollywood films Hottest popular worldwide among serious film fans and film enthusiasts have) that this film is the story of unusual complexity and special I own the famous critic James Bradinly: Shutter Island and inception complexity even in the face of it seem easy! The Black Swan is much darker than the two of you and as the name implies, the film's characters, the film is supposed to be all evil and darkness.Nina (played by acclaimed Natalie Portman) is a Balryn sensitive and vulnerable to stress and fear of success in work and in particular to gain a major role in the strong views of white / black is. And to do so and show him that affects his personal life and most importantly it is mentally impaired.Black Swan in the film that viewers see it mixed with a world of illusion and reality that made ​​my mind to look at is Nina.I personally very much in the film, most of what happened in the film or the story not so elastic for a general audience, ahead of other surprises are waiting for an accident or apart from the strange world of fantasy images of Nina and the story was More alarmingly elastic and for the curious audience.But the very positive things that might affect the movie than it is to show the art director, Tobias (played by Vincent Cassel with the role and place of choice) is that to keep Nina Msbtsh and their freedom from the evil and the degree of knavery, seductive and dark for its proper role in the lead was a black swan! He encouraged her to Nina and Nina so that it could cause an innocent person and I always worried about her, slowly and gradually and deeply in the black darkness along with the audience was even a surprise to some that fall into a peaceful and innocent Nina a very bad-tempered bad and dangerous to the lovely Nina Nina actually be converted into another. That is why I said that his daughter Nina in a sequence where she says that her mother was head Shyrynsh what happen? Nina says it killed!Finally, Nina for great views and the strong white (innocence) and then a black (evil), a strange world of the mind and personality to the ideal perfection of the art director and his role will require strong and so his dream of rapture that salvation comes in the movies won ... ...Directed by Natalie Portman's amazing to play (I believe the game is undoubtedly superior and extremely deep in the role of the Its effect now she will not leave) in the characterization of Nina's innocence and whithe get to the black and Vice or evil of course the show Melancholia and especially Masochism Malakhvlyayy much work has been very successful.Aronofsky cinema mastering the elements of fear and apprehension (from the Sound to look and sound and camera motion) and it combines the horror genre with films such as subtle as the game has met its size is exemplary.Particularly with her masterful directing cinemotgraphy extraordinary beauty and elegance to doom the dance ballet dancer body as flexible as the string around and around it was a very significant point, especially during the peak of the film when The camera's shoulder with a sense of fear and apprehension in the filth and the evil sought to temper that runs incredibly see Natalie Portman.While editing the film in any way if it does not add extra stage, film and keep the rhythm of the reasons Do not fall audience that is actually due to the lack of scenes that much less dramatic, and be will hit the specific type validity.The last work of Scorsese, Shutter Island,of Psychology or the latest work Nolan, inception scientific terms (metaphysical and ideological) are highly controversial, the film due to a strong black Aronofsky Ghabt philosophical artistic director in the position of a philosopher / director I put it very well and film analysis and arnofsky will remain.",10,1,2,27 November 2011
