Hereditary," Dont bother going to see!!
","Had high hopes on this film as I've seen the trailer advertised a lot , wasn't what I expected. It eventually took an hour for the film to get exiting , very slow start.
It wasn't very scary at all. The ending was awful very confusing and didn't make sense , people were actually laughing in the cinema because of the strange ending was ??
The only thing I would rate this movie for is the actor who played the mothers performance, She manged to capture the mothers pain and paranoia perfectly !",4,3,7,14 July 2018
