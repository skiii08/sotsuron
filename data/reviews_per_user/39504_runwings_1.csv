The Hangover," Good laughs but smiles are more numerous.
","I thought the trailers were fairly accurate as far as what to expect in this movie as it did have good laughs and funny dialog and wacky characters that gave the viewer a worthy joyride from a blur of odd elements that setup a cute and fun punchline to a strange night of zany occurrences in which 4 very different and likable male boobs happen to experience in the land of Las Vegas!There are send ups on Rain Man , Three men and a baby and so on mixed in with the plot tension of the missing guy friend after an awesome night of fun that the remaining 3 parters cant seem to remember!The writer does a great job of taking us thru a fun ride of intrigue and laughter on the way to finding a friend and maybe finding new spirits within each of the characters that will not only make this movie worth the price of the ticket, but will launch the careers of several of the actors into the 'stratosphere' ( no pay for this plug right?) and 'parlay' the box office success to a delightful return in the Hangover Part -2 !!Hope you don't bring any kids below 17 or 16 yrs old to this movie however unless you want to expose them to some racy pics that outraged the Nuns at the theater I went to :) !!Enjoy at least 1,000 smiles if you don't laugh out loud several times watching this movie as it is very cute at the least for those viewers who just think or act like laughter is too difficult an undertaking for them.Even the tightest of humor grinches out there will have to bust out , relax and give a fat bunch of chuckles to 'The Hangover ' !!! :) :) :) !!!",9,1,2,5 July 2009
