The Blair Witch Project," Oh dear!
","When getting ready to go and see the Blair Witch Project I had seen a fair amount of television programmes showing scenes of the film with pictures of film-goers coming out of the cinema scared witless. The thing is that they must have been witless in the first place because all this film is, is a cheap camcorder documentary. The actors strive to be real which somehow they never achieve. Only the last 15 minutes of the film were remotely scary while the 65 mins at the start were weak. To believe the legend you would have to be Mr. Gullible which doesn't help. I thought that in the last 15 minutes the film could redeam itself with... (do not read on if you haven't seen the film).....some mutilations and the girl (who screamed so much I wanted to kill her)running around being chased. Unfortunately this film would have been good if it was as good as the hype, but it never could match that, maybe that was the problem. I read somewhere that the film cost $33,000 dollars to make so I shouldn't be too harsh but as it approches or maybe goes over $100 million in the box office I can but wonder 'is this a huge scam?' Th mystery of the Blair Witch to me is how it ever became so great in the eyes of the critics.  when I register my vote on IMDB I will do so accordinally.",Null,2,3,6 November 1999
