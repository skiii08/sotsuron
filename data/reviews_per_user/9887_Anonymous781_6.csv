Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Superior Movie!
","I actually thought (at first glance of the title) that this movie would horribly suck, and be an absolute waste of my time and money. I could not have been more wrong. This movie turned out to be a favorite. The story is wonderful, and the scenes and music go along with it in a near-perfect way. If you like action, they threw in a good deal of that as well. Definitely a must-see movie. I have not seen Vol.1 yet, but I surely intend to, as soon as it comes in at the movie store. I'm not really sure what all to say of it without revealing the plot and story. The star of the show is beautiful.. and deadly, yet an interesting character. Uma Thurman does a great job in her role here. Incidentally, the same guy had a hand in making this movie, as helped make Pulp Fiction (Quentin Tarantino). What a great movie.",10,0,1,29 August 2006
Dawn of the Dead," A+ Movie!
","This is a great movie. I haven't seen the original 1978 one, so I can't say whether or not this is a 'good' remake of the '78 version. However, since I haven't seen the '78 version, I am coming at this movie from a totally clean slate, and can tell you that, this movie, by itself, not considering the '78 version (obviously) is a great movie. I was on the edge of my seat for just about the entire movie, and enjoyed every minute of it. Once it was done, I just wanted to see more, and more. I had never seen a zombie movie before, and didn't know they could be so fun.I highly recommend this movie. It may not be as good as the classic, or it may be better (I don't know), but it is a good movie either way. Very entertaining.",10,0,1,17 August 2006
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Forced to Give It a 9
","*May Contain Spoilers* Okay, on with the review. I find myself compelled to give this movie a 9 for the things I did like in it. I didn't care for the humor attempts in the movie, like Arnold telling the gas station attendant to talk to the hand or whatever, or when he put on those star-sunglasses in the beginning. I think these movies should remain serious, and shouldn't be tainted with stupid humor, but that's just my opinion. Outside of this, I thought the female terminator could have (and should have) been a lot more attractive. Further, I wished that the actor who played John Connor in T2 was used again to make T3. The new guy just couldn't replace the old John Connor (not that the new guy's performance was THAT bad, its just he can't replace the original). The other thing I didn't really care for that comes to mind was how quick the new T-100 terminator got his sass mouth. The old terminator was much more serious, and had to be coached by the then-young John Connor before he picked up his attitude. The T-100 seemed to do this with very little if any provocation whatsoever from John or John's spouse. Aside from that, sex would be good.. between John and his spouse, and it didn't happen. It shouldn't be raunchy or distasteful, but should be passionate and emotional - and done in a way to further the film. Aside from all these shortcomings I saw in the film, (I kind of think there were more I am forgetting), I have to rate this a 9 because it wasn't a non-enjoyable movie, and there were some qualities that I liked to it, such as the twilightzone-like thoughts that come to mind when one thinks about time travel and all the wondefully interesting ideas to play around with that seem to follow the subject around.",9,2,3,8 October 2006
The Butterfly Effect," It Surpassed My Expectations
","At the instant I found out Ashton Kutcher (not sure if I'm spelling his name right or not) was in this movie, I thought it was going to be silly. At first, due to all the hilarity of all the other films he was in, I couldn't properly see him in his place in the film. This didn't last long, however, as he actually did surprisingly well, even for his character. After a while - that all faded away entirely, and I was more or less absorbed by the Butterfly Effect. Ahh, what a great movie. If you haven't seen this one yet, it is most definitely worth a watch. I might be rating it a bit high due to the fact that I thought it would be a waste of my time, but what can I say, I thought it would be terrible, and I walked out *more* than satisfied. A great movie, and definitely worth a watch. I recommend it.",10,0,0,2 September 2006
Army of Darkness," Overall, good movie.
","The only reason I'm giving this movie a 9 instead of a 10 is that there was occasionally some stupid humor in the movie... of course there were some good bits of humor in it, but some of it wasn't to my taste. Overall, an excellent movie, and a classic imo. If you haven't seen it yet, you should. Go rent Evil Dead, Evil Dead 2, and this (Evil Dead 3) aka Army of Darkness. Amazing movie, though not everything made sense to me. What a fun movie. I can't really think of words to put it in. It isn't really like any other movies I have seen, yet it is definitely worth seeing. At first, I was reluctant to watch it, but my friends pushed me along, and I'm happy they did.",9,2,3,19 September 2006
The Green Mile," Amazing Movie!
","This movie was amazing. I don't typically like or watch drama type films, but this was quite an experience as far as movies go. I highly recommend you all go see this if you haven't already. This movie certainly deserves a 10. Two thumbs up for a real classic movie. You will laugh, you will cry, and you will possibly be changed. Such a superior movie like this is quite a rarity, and isn't something to be missed. I highly recommend this movie. It is worth the time to go see it. You will not regret it. A movie that is quite simply this amazing doesn't come by very often. You don't want to miss this. What are you waiting for? Go see The Green Mile.",10,0,2,2 September 2006
