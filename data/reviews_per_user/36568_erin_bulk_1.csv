Walk the Line," Excellent
","I was never a huge fan of Johnny Cash or June Carter's music. It's not so much that I disliked either of them, I'd just never devoted much time to listening to their work... Until I saw this movie, that is. My boyfriend is a huge Johnny Cash fan, so he convinced me to See it. I went into the movie with no expectations, and came out completely impressed. There was incredible chemistry between the actors, and I was amazed by their singing their own parts. While their voices don't match John and June's exactly, their performances were totally convincing. Since seeing the movie I have become nearly obsessed with the music of June Carter, Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, and the like. Phoeniz and Witherspoon are amazing!",9,1,2,4 March 2006
