Minority Report," Not, as many of you undoubtedly say, a terribly good film...
","Not since the disaster of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, has there been a more-overrated disaster of a science-fiction adaptation. 'Minority Report' the Speilberg film, has little in common with it's original incarnation of a Phillip K. Dick Short-Story. Why is it that Hollywood, feels the need to rape this particular author's master-works, with such hidious films as 'Total Recall' and 'Screamers' and now 'Minority Report' which bear little, or no resemblace to their original forms. Blade Runner withstanding, no one has done a decent adaptation of a Phillip K. Dick book/story.Sure, Blade Runner threw the book out the window, but what it did accomplish was a believable vision of the future, without going all heart-gushingly-gooshy as Spielberg has a tendancy to do. Let me put it simple, Spielberg's future vision, is too damn squeaky clean, to be convincing. Sure, with the advent of 'Pre-crime', murder is done for, at least in the D.C. area, but everyone seems so damned 'perfect'...'made-up'...even the so-called 'scumbags' of the 'Sprawl'(a term not so creatively STOLEN from visionary William Gibson).It was the same in Speilberg's garbage 'A.I.' which could have been brilliantly done, had it not been for Speilberg's disguisting attempt to BLATENTLY GRAB TEARS from the damned audience of sheep. 'Minority Report' is not only guilty of this also, considering the short-story's Anderton(as far as we know) is not even married(nor ever has been). But he completely disgraces Dick's original plotline about conspiracies, giving this a 'happy' ending, adding the 'tearworthy' spouse/child thing, and a load of completely UNNECESSARY, and unlikely humorous moments, like the 'Eyeball' sequence, which have no bearing whatsoever on the main plot of the film, and make it seem like the work of someone attempting to please(everyone,which he is).The original 'Minority Report' was not family friendly, nor should this version be. It was grim, depressing, and in touch with true human nature. This was not. Spielberg is a no-talent hack. His films are cliche', unoriginal, and a discredit to their original works. His screenwriter even saw fit to rip other famous Cyberpunkish writers, because he was so uncreative.Take the 'Sprawl' sequence for example. This was a blatent rip of a William Gibson term, including the idea of a 'Black-Market Surgeon' who specialized in Body Modification(reference: Chiba). This, along with everyone who calls this pathetic excuse for a film 'art' just turn my stomach. Speilberg is NOT a visionary. He's just looking not to offend anyone.",Null,0,0,5 February 2003
