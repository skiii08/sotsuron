Mission: Impossible III," A decent action film, but disappointing
","Mission: Impossible III Starring: Tom Cruise PG-13I've been waiting for this film since last year, and so I was looking forward to it, even though Tom Cruise is getting weird. I walked out of the theater glad and disappointed. Tom Cruise was all right, but I think people are getting tired of him, plus he has definitely made many angry. Philip Seymore Hoffman was very good at being a twisted scum-bag villain. I laughed at his death scene. The rest of the cast was OK, but it just seemed like a movie was to show off Tom, not about the team like the original series. The action scenes were pretty good. Tom got the crap kicked out of him really good. Overall, I liked it.",7,1,2,15 May 2006
The Longest Yard," A fun and entertaining film
","I never saw the original film. I was en't really expecting anything great out of this film. All the critics were saying bad things about it, but the critics are not always right. It was a very funny film. It was about a former MVP football player who steals his girlfriend's car. He goes to prison and the warden tells him to couch his own football team against the warden's team. Chris Rock's character is killed and Paul is framed. It turns out Paul's team wins. Chris Rock was the funniest guy in the film. The men dressed up as women were hilarious. I think this is one of Adam Sandler's best films. The big guy was funny, especially when he would ram the other team players. A fun and entertaining film.",7,1,3,21 June 2005
Madagascar," why did i bother?
","I went to see this movie thinking it would be funny. I also felt that way when I went to see the Village. I thought it would be scary. Well, Madagascar was not a very funny movie. The Village was also not scary. Anyway, lets get back to Madagascar. There was a few funny moments, but I didn't enjoy it like The Incredibles or Shrek 1 and 2. I don't really like animation from Dreamworks. I think they try to make it for adults and children. Most of the time, that doesn't work very well. Hayao Miyazaki is one of some that can make films for both adults and children. If you like loud annoying laughs, pointless slapstick moments, or just like talking animals, you should see this. Well, I liked it better than the Village.",5,0,2,15 June 2005
My Neighbor Totoro," My favorite Miyazaki film
","A great and creative story. It is about two girls named Satsuki and Mei. Them and their dad move to the countryside. Their mother is in the hospital because of illness. They meet Granny, who helps them to move in the house and is a farmer. The reason that they moved there was because of a gigantic camfer tree.( which looks like about the size of the Empire State Bulding.) When they move in, they find dust bunnies, little creatures made of dust.(of course.) One day Mei Finds a little white thing that can turn invisible. Later, she sees a medium sized blue one with a sack of acorns. Then she goes into the forest and finds the large gray one. The totoros take the two on adventures, and help them deal with their mother in the hospital. A great film and is highly entertaining. In the beginning, the dialog is very annoying.",8,1,2,16 June 2005
Batman Begins," The best Batman film ever!!!
","I took my dad out for Father's day to see this. We saw it at a new theater that opened a few days ago. It was great. I think it is even better than the first film. Batman was great, Batman Returns was just as good, Batman Forever was decent, and Batman and Robin was just plain terrible. It is about Bruce Wayne before he becomes Batman. He trains with the League of Shadows. He meets Lucius Fox, who is the scientific head of Wayne enterprises. He gives Bruce the car, weapons and equipment, and the suit. He learns that a hallucinogen is going to destroy the city. It turns out that the league is behind it. Christen Bale is great. Michael Caine, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, and Morgan Freeman were also good. We meet the Scarecrow, who was very frighting and cool looking. I had no regrets seeing this.",10,0,0,21 June 2005
The Da Vinci Code," One of the year's best
","I read the book about 6 months ago because of all the hype. It was a very good book. It was suspenseful, fast-paced, and interesting. I had high hopes about the movie. I was pleased. It was exactly as I hoped it would be. The acting was decent, especially from Ian McCellean. Tom Hanks was all right, but he just seemed off, but everyone else was good in their roles.After I walked out of the theater, I saw 3 protesters next to the red light. I mean, come on people. Don't you have anything better to do? Can't anyone understand that it is Fiction? It is a novel, which if you check the dictionary, it says work of fiction. Now, can't anyone just watch it? Come on, it's just a movie.",8,0,3,21 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," The Best Harry Potter yet
","I went to see this over the weekend and I wondered how close it would be to the book, considering it was only a little longer that Sorcerer's Stone. I walked out happy. The special effects were great and real looking. The adult actors were very good, especially Michael Gambon, who I thought he was better in this one than Prisonor of Azkaban. Even though he isn't as good as the great Richard Harris, I thought he did very well. Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliffe were better in this one than the others, especially Daniel Radcliffe. Emma Watson really got on my nerves as Hermione in this occasionally. She seemed to act too melodramatic sometimes, but she was all right. As a fan of the books, I think Steve Kloves did better on the screenplay on this one. Even though many things were taken out and it felt a little rushed, everything went in place all right. I'm glad it was rated PG-13 because the story gets a lot darker as it goes on. I thought Voldemort looked pretty cool, except I still can't remember why he was a little half-human midget. Anyway, I wouldn't really recommend this to younger children because of some language, Frightening and violent images. Overall, I think this is the best Harry Potter film yet, and made up for some of the mistakes in Prisoner of Azkaban. I have high hopes for Order of the Phenoix.",8,0,0,30 November 2005
The Godfather: Part III," Why does everyone dislike this movie?
","The Godfather Part III I saw this on TV a little while back and finally got around to review it. I loved the first one and also liked the second one, except it was too long! Well, anyway it takes place like thirty years after the Godfather Part II. Michael is trying to legitimize his business and get out of the gangster business. He meets his nephew and future godfather Vincent, who falls in love with his daughter Mary.(But they're cousins?) I'm not going to tell you all the stuff, but I'll tell you that the ending is absolutely heartbreaking. Michael is walking out of an opera with his whole family. Then suddenly a guy shoots at him, but instead kills Mary. As a crowd almost covers him, Vincent pulls out a pistol and shoots him. Its heartbreaking because it shows past images of Michael dancing with Kay in Los Vegas and him dancing with Mary. In the end, he falls over dead, alone. A great film and is so underrated.",10,1,3,11 December 2005
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," A fun way to spend a Saturday night
","I went to see this movie over the weekend. I thought that It was a fun and cool film to watch. There was plenty of action, and some funny parts too. For the people that don't know what it is about, here it is. It is about John Smith and Jane Smith.( I think thats what there names were.) They both go to separate jobs. Later, they find out that they are both secret agents who are hired to kill each other. Jane wanted a divorce because she thought that he only married her so that he could spy on her. John felt the same way. Eventually, they find out that they were set up and the only way that they could survive was if they worked together. Then they fall in love again. I would recommend this to anyone who loves action and spy movies, like the Bourne Identity. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have a lot of chemistry between them. There isen't really any mature content besides violence, some language,and a sex scene in the earlier scenes. A great movie!",7,0,3,15 June 2005
War of the Worlds," It could have been worse...
","I saw this last night. I have one thing to say. Why? What the heck did they do? I had high expectations for this. I loved the original movie and the book, so since Steven Spielburg did it, I thought it would be good. I was wrong. The movie started out all right I guess, but then it went downhill. It had too much Tom cruise in it. Dakota Fanning's screams were extremely annoying. There was too much family stuff in it. It was like Tim Burton's Planet of the apes. They took a great story, and put a lot of special effects and ruined the story. I still am angry with the new Planet of the apes ending. I think Steven Spielburg should dump Tom Cruise and do something with some one else, like Tom Hanks.",5,0,1,24 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Finally!!!
","At last! Star Wars Episode 3 Revenge of the Sith is out. It was a great film. It connected the two sagas together perfectly.All my questions were finally answered. After the last two films, I got nervous. I thought it would be a disaster because of the corny lines from the last one. I was wrong. I think it will win some awards. The fight scenes were pretty cool, especially the fight between Yoda and Palpatine. The fight scene between Obi-wan and Anakin was also awesome. There was no corny dialog, except maybe two parts. The acting was much better. The highlight of the movie I think was Ian McDiarmid. Hayden Christensen was also very good. After it was over, I walked out of the theater satisfied. Thank you, George Lucas.",10,1,8,28 May 2005
