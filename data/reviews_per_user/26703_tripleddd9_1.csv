Scarface," Say hello to my little friend!
","To make a long story short, no mob movie comes close to this. The Godfather series is a different type of movie, it focuses many characters, while Scarface is mostly letting you get to know Tony Montana. The plot is excellent and entertaining. Tony is as bad as they get, but he does show his sort of good side during the movie in a way... Excellent ending...What else could be said, I rather not spoil anything for you who didn't see it yet...10/10... a classic",10,0,1,24 July 2002
