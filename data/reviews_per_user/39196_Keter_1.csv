The Devil's Advocate," The game of the Satan
","We learn in the study of Kabbalah that one of the greatest tricks the Satan, our arch-enemy, ever played on human-kind was to convince us that he does not exist. This movie shows how he plays his game, being the master of the lives and destinies of most of us today. In order for us to take control of our lives we need to elevate our consciousness to a higher level and to learn the operational tactics of our opponent, the destructive cosmic intelligence that we call Satan, and this film will help us to understand how he controls our minds and lives.",9,1,1,11 February 1999
