Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Worst movie I have ever seen and ... NOT funny at all
","Until a few years ago you could depend on IMDb scores to be really dependable. The top-250 contained milestones of film worth seeing. More and more I see that films that are just popular occupy high position. Mind you I like watching popular movies, but I understand that e.g. Die Hard isn't as good a film as Casablanca.But this film blows my trust in the members of this forum to dust. I have never ever walked out of a movie before, but this time I did. Borat is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. And it is NOT funny. There were a few times I laughed, but even then I found that the jokes could have been better. It is not that I can stand jokes about Jews or women. But I really rate Benny Hill as far superior to Borat.Seeing people giving this film 10 stars makes me wonder if the rating shouldn't at least be moderated a bit.Borat better than 12 monkeys? The Thing? And why don't I see the complete works of Louis de Funes ranked higher than this movie.Sorry, from now on I will be much more careful in treating IMDb as a trustworthy source of information on the quality of a film.",1,146,294,19 November 2006
