Deja Vu," Another Touchstone...
","This movie was a piece of work. Up from the very beginning we get a surreal image of New Orleans' people being 'grateful' about Katrina. That is pictured by a slogan saying 'Katrina only made us stronger'. Then, there's the Fox News helicopter being the only one covering the ferry. Of course, the whole movie seems part of the relentless post 9/11 scare mongering tactics. Too many direct and indirect allusions to 'support the troops' and 'mission accomplished' makes it a blatant propaganda piece. The little sci-fi part was absolutely pathetic. Don't get me wrong, I like being lied to for entertainment's sake, but way too many trivial things didn't add up.The acting, while backed by names like Denzel and Val, was not anywhere near what the standard of a 'good movie'. The only thing the movie had going for it, was the very good job Tony Scott did with the action scenes. All in all, go see this one if you're a lobotomized action fan. Otherwise, better skip it.",1,21,43,9 April 2007
Children of Men," Great picture!
","'Children of men' is one of those politically engaged well-thought movies that seem to be quite numerous lately. Pretty much every 'hot potato' is discussed in this movie from environmental issues to immigration. For an unknown reason, women worldwide started losing their fertility. In a totalitarian England of 2027, a handful of activists are challenging the government's abusive responses to increased illegal immigration. Theo (Clive Owen) was one of the early members of the resistance but turned cynic along the way. His long lost love asks for his help and as he discovers what seems to be a miracle. The cast was pretty good, and an amazing soundtrack made watching this piece a great experience. The level of realism was top-notch throughout the whole movie. However, it seems to be propagating the myth that Arabs/Muslims are inherently violent. Every time there's a terrorism act, the main character (Theo) assumes it's Islamists. In a ghetto (Bexhill) turned into a conflict zone, an angry mob of Arabs, most of them wearing masks, carry machine guns and chant 'Allah is great' in Arabic. Grafittis on the wall read 'Uprising' written both in English an Arabic (Intifada) that is reminiscent of Palestine. The 'Intifada' was a response to half a century of oppression and destitution and using the imagery in the movie only accentuates the cleavage between the enlightened few and the majority that relies on mainstream media for information. Nonetheless, the movie was very enjoyable and if you're looking for entertainment I would highly recommend it.",6,1,4,10 February 2007
