The Expendables 2," Weak!
","Mindless action!! I guess it could be at best 'entertaining' if you're 9 or under but it does not come close to the 'action films' worth watching! Although, Sly's intention is clearly to respond to 'bad action movies' but you can't win with a losing hand!! At best this movie could play as a 'Kemp piece' which holds a mirror to a 'male whack off' culture which underlines 'spend time at the gym - not at the library' if only this was anywhere near a mental vicinity of the filmmakers while making this movie. The problem with these kinds of movies is that, ironically, filmmakers think they're making a good film... as one notable writer once mused 'we've seen so much crap in movies that we don't even recognize it as crap anymore.' and this is sad.",3,0,1,26 July 2013
Inside Llewyn Davis," Its about the time... and music.
","Cannes 2013: Interesting choice for 'instagramic' iconography puts this Cohen picture among one of the most 'mature' works. Oscar Issac is on the rise!! I've seen 4 films with him in the last 9 months! This guy's been busy and justly so - he adds a unique flavor (due to his ethnicity) to everything he touches! Great pace, sharp dialog (as always) and a real treat of having a cameo by 'maestro Salieri himself' the great F. Murray Abraham. It definitely managed to impose a 'melancholic disposition' in me after seeing it... I wonder how will it work with the 'hipster' audience who seem to be crazy about the era story is set in.",8,8,41,27 July 2013
Pocahontas," perhaps the most important Disney animated feature!
",I really loved the music and how it moved... the orchestrations were very smart and at moments complex (polyphony) and the lyrics really contributed to the story's very serious undertone. The portrayal of Native Americans in the media has always been (and justly so) a sensitive subject but I am happy to report that it appears this movie has done it with great taste and respect for the culture. The animation is great and certain sequences (most notably 'Colors of the Wind' are just masterful.I could actually feel the wind at the end! A great watch! An important film... not a popcorn Disney (like some recent ones) Bravo!,8,1,2,27 July 2013
