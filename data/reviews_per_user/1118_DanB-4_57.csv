Saturday Night Fever," A Reference Point of 70's Culture
","To watch this movie today, it almost plays like a parody of itself. The clothes, the language, the music, the Farrah Fawcett posters on the wall ... but what a great trip.This movie is about many things. Dance is a central part of this film but it is not what it is about. It is more about what dance does for Tony, how the Disco is the one place where his life is in order - where he rules.Whether you loved or hated Disco in its peak, I believe that every guy secretly wanted to be Tony Manero. Handsome, confident swagger, well dressed (for the time), great dancer and a lady killer. Who wouldn't want that on their CV. But this movie shows us the dysfunctional homelife and everything else that Tony yearns for and doesn't get.Twenty Five years later, we can now also have a full view of the cultural impact of this film. It is a 70's reference point for everything - fashion, music, dance, culture, language - and it is the launch of one of the most colourful careers in Hollywood. The music, though, has the longest lasting impact. The songs from this film are still routinely played in clubs and weddings, on the radio, covered by bands, sampled into hip hop music, and have become the backbone of the disco era. Saturday Night Fever is an important and wonderful film not to be missed. I hated it in the 70's - I love it now. If you didn't like it then, give it a chance. Look for the R-Rated version and have fun!***1/2 out of 4.",8,0,1,22 July 2001
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Disappointing. And what's up with Darth Maul?
","I did not think that a lack of substance could leave me disappointed at a Star Wars movie, but it did. The technical achievement of this movie is beyond what you expect, most notably the pod race and the deployment of the battle droids in the final battle scene. I even liked Jar Jar. But the script was lame, the was not sense of urgency and the great evil presence that over shadowed Episodes IV, V and VI simply wasn't there. And then there's Darth Maul - what a grave disappointment. Good movies have great bad guys and Vader is one of the all-time greats. Darth Maul is extraneous fight scene filler (albeit well-done).  He had no more personality than a school yard bully. I would not recommend this movie, although I will see Episode II and hope for more. **1/2 out of ****.",6,1,2,29 June 1999
Catch Me If You Can," Perfect Balance
","Credibility is an odd thing - either you have it or you don't. And one of its key elements is believing you have it yourself. If you act in a certain way, people will respond in a certain way. This theme which was so beautifully portrayed in 'Being There' is central to Catch Me If You Can. Early in the film, Frank Abagnale sees a pilot and notices that everyone around him adores and admires him, and most importantly, does not question him when he cashes a cheque. Solution: Become a pilot. All you need is lingo (which he gets by fawning over an airport official) and a uniform (which he cons his way into). From here, we get the story of one of histories great con men, who before his 23rd birthday has successfully convinced people he was a pilot and doctor and a lawyer and had passed $4,000,000 of bad cheques. It it s wonderful light and entertaining ride.Catch Me If You Can is a major accomplishment for most directors, but for Speilberg, it is like a weekend off - a movie he made to take a break from making movies. Not to say that it is bad - it is a chase movie with more laughs than most comedies and extraordinary attention to detail. It recreates the innocent, pre-Vietnam 60's beautifully, a time when an airline pilot had instant credibility and charm.The movies three leads, DiCaprio Hanks and Walken are all at the top of their game. Having fun with there roles while at the same time creating memorable characters we care about. FBI agent Carl Hanratty is a dry-as-toast career fed with little more in life than the crooks he chases, but still, Hanks gives him depth and a personality. Christopher Walken is perfect is an odd role for him as Frank Sr., the beloved and hapless father of the anti-hero lead, who never quite gets the breaks in life he wants or deserves. But In Abagnale Jr Leo Di Caprio creates a criminal character we cheer for. As I watched this film, I was simultaneously cheering for both the bad guy and the cop. A tad over long, but Catch Me If You Can is a movie worth watching, and even owning. ***1/2 out of ****.",8,0,1,12 December 2003
Minority Report," Great, but Not Vintage Spielberg
","When you have Schindler's List, Jaws, Color Purple, and SPR on your C.V., anything you do creates great expectations. To that extent, Minority Report was a tad disappointing because I was hoping to be blown out of my seat. When I look at it in its own right, it is great entertainment, but not in Spielberg's top 5.The plot is simple and complex all at once, and is the most intriguing part of the film. The Department of Pre-crime is run by Tom Cruise in the city of Washington DC. With the aid of three psychic 'pre-cogs', murders are anticipated  and prevented, but the would be perpetrators are still arrested and imprisoned. Out of nowhere, the pre-cogs predict that Cruise will murder a man he does not know. Now it seems that the system which for six years has been perfect, has a flaw. Or does it?That description does not do the plot or the themes in this film any justice. What may be most entertaining about this film is the extraordinary emotion, conversation and debate it generates. Can you punish someone for an intended crime? Can that person not control his fate? Is the pre-cog a willing participant in all this? How can such a system be beat? Moral, technical, and legal issues abound around this film, while it carries on as a great action movie. Extremely complex.We could debate all day about possible tiny plot holes dealing with the visions of the pre-cogs, Tom Cruise's eyes, his run from the law and other points of the film. But when you watch this film, remember that exposing flaws of pre-crime is a goal of many of the characters. Perhaps that is simply what it being done.As with every Speilbergian outing, you have a stunning technical achievement in this film. Janusz Kaminsky can see a film like no other person on Earth, and the special effects serve the plot, not the other way around. The scene with the spiders is worth the price of admission alone. Special mention to Samantha Morton is wonderful supporting role as Agatha, one of the pre-cogs.I give a strong recommendation to this film, but don't go in looking for a future classic. ***1/2 out of ****",9,0,0,28 July 2002
Citizen Kane," Proof of Welles' Genius
","There is a great deal of talk of Citizen Kane's technical achievement, and so there should be. In 1941, this film broke ground that still marvels today, and arguably is the earliest (famous) example of non-linear story telling. The cinematography is absolutely perfect and the near endless list of famous shots (my favourite being the infinite images in the hall of mirrors) make this movie watchable without even trying to understand it.But above all, Citizen Kane is a wonderful story - a great tale of a man with everything who really has nothing. This movie is perfect story-telling and a great American tragedy.Kane needs to be seen over and over again. I defy anyone to watch it and accurately predict what scene comes next. But still, it flows well and never comes across as disjointed. I have seen itabout 9 times now - each time I pick up more and enjoy the film more. Orson Welles was an absolute genius and Citizen Kane is proof enough. **** out of ****.",10,0,0,15 September 1999
Mississippi Burning," The Best Film of 1988
","Great movies are ones that invoke a strong emotional response that lingers long after the movie is over. Mississippi Burning is that kind of film. You may love it, you  may hate it. You may think that it is an accurate depiction of the south in 1964, you may think its pure fiction. No matter what you will respond strongly.Director Alan Parker has been down this road before with Midnight Express, another crushing, gut-wrenching tale based on a true story. In both cases, a great deal of liberty is taken with the facts, but that doesn't matter. Mississippi Burning is not a docudrama or an A & E special, it is at its heart, a police drama, and a near perfect one at that.It is criticized by some for its depiction of southerners of the time as a group of brain-dead racists with no moral fiber whatsoever. I don't believe that is the movie's intention, but it spends time showing this side of society to make us understand how hate breeds itself, and how it becomes a way of life and an accepted standard. As one character states, 'When we were seven years old, they told us that segregation was in the bible. You hear that long enough, you start to believe it'.Mississippi Burning won a (well-deserved) Oscar for cinematography, but sat and watched Rain Main take home the majors. It was clearly the best film of 1988 and stands as one of the great works of American cinema of the 80's. Hackman and Dafoe are at their best, and Frances McDormand delivers a beautifully understated, powerful performance as the deputy's wife - a woman at war with her sense of right and wrong, struggling with fear and loyalty. Her character is the centerpiece of the movie.This is not a preachy or melodramatic movie. You won't get a lecture on why racism is wrong. You will get an rich, engaging crime drama depicting a pivotal time in American History, and you will never forget it.**** out of ****.",Null,109,129,19 June 1999
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," A Family Film in Every Sense
","As a parent, I deeply admire this film for adhering to a PG rating. It could have gone over the top in the battle scenes and with gore and completely ruined itself. Its jaw-dropping box office success was due to the fact that is was the best family film of 2005 and one of the better ones in many years.Narnia's story is well known. Four young English children trying to escape World War II are sent to a large country home. There, they stumble upon an old wardrobe which leads them to the mythical land of Narnia, where strange and friendly creatures live. Narnia is cursed to a permanent winter while it is under the rule of the icy White Witch, devilishly played by Tilda Swinton. The four siblings soon find themselves in a battle for their own lives and for the very freedom of Narnia itself.The parallels to LOTR are many, but Narnia comes across as LOTR-Lite. The battle scene at the end is exciting, not scary and Andrew Adamson has perfect sense in when to cut a scene and how far to take things. Yes, its frightening, but just enough.And, as an allegory of the life of Jesus, it has a strong moral message that allows for some great conversation with your kids after the film.Well made, wonderfully acted, good (but not great) FX, this is a film worth owning if you have kids, and maybe even if you don't. ***1/2 out of ****.",9,0,0,14 April 2006
Madagascar," Good but by no means great
","2005 was a weak year for animation to be sure. Madgascar stands up well, but in other years would have looked weaker than it is. It is a light, funny and wonderfully inoffensive family film, but all those good qualities make it a tad dull.Madagascar knows how to make use of peripheral characters. The penguins, King Julian, the scared subway passengers, the monkeys all add to this movie and make it more interesting. Its lead, Ben Stiller's Alex the lion is the dullest of the bunch.Madagascar opens in Central Park Zoo, where Alex is the star of the show. He loves his life. Luxury, steaks to snack on daily, legions of adoring fans and an endless parade of cheesy merchandise bearing his image. His friends Melman the Giraffe (a hypochondriac with all the medication he needs) and Gloria the Hippo (no body image problem here), seem content, but not as in love with the zoo as Alex.Marty the Zebra, perfectly voiced by Chris Rock, is in a different zone. He runs on his treadmill, longing for the wild. He does not really know what that this, but he know instinctively that that is where he belongs. One day, h breaks out of the zoo and wanders Manhattan looking for the wild. This leads to the movie's funniest scene, with the escapee Zebra asking directions from a police horse.Marty's friends chase after him to try and coax him back to the zoo, but all are caught and shipped off to a wild life reserve. On the way, their crates fall from their ship and they land in Madagascar.From there, the story does not really go too far. It stays funny largely thanks for Sasha Baron Cohen and Cedric the Entertainer, but it is lightweight in comparison to its contemporaries.If you are looking for a fun couple of hours with the kids, Madagascar is funny enough for the mom and dad crowd. Although the sequel has been announced, it is mediocre entertainment at best. *** out of ****.",7,0,1,29 December 2005
Finding Nemo," Outstanding Family Film
","Finding Nemo will find its way to the top of the Pixar hierarchy. Funny, visually enthralling, original and scary, it is true Disney formula and completely unique all at once.Using the ocean around Australia gives the film limitless possibility for colours, creatures and adventures, as well as whacky accents. Our heros fight sharks in a twelve step program, pelicans, a flat out hysterical flock of seagulls, an old submarine, a vicious four-year-old with braces, fish obsessed with dental procedures and a hazardous group of jellyfish. Even though the plot is formula, the film is not.The film involves Marlin and his son Nemo. Early on, Nemo is abducted by a diver and locked in a fish tank in a dentists office. His cowardly father embarks to find him with the help of Dory, a fish with 'short term memory loss'. In the tank, Nemo encounters a small band of captives who all dream of freedom. I saw finding Nemo with five children aged 3 to 10, and they all were delighted, scared and thrilled. At the same time, my wife and I had belly laughs at the humour which was sufficiently adult without being inappropriate for the kids. The true delight of Finding Nemo is in the animation. With every feature, Pixar refines its art and is able to add more to it's films. The colours and visuals are rich and delightful. Note the way the reds, pinks and purples give way to dark blue and grey when the characters are in peril. The small role characters, like the seagulls, crabs, turtles are created with care and depth.I cannot recommend this movie enough. Like the Little Mermaid, having kids will give you an excuse to see this movie, but you won't need one. **** out of ****.",9,1,2,31 May 2003
The Day After Tomorrow," So Bad, I Almost Admired It
","The Day After Tomorrow is a implausible, paint-by-numbers disaster movie, so filled with clichés, so predictable and that approaches badness from so many angles that I admire it, to an extent. Roland Emmerich has thrown logic, plot and character out and gone for sheer popcorn entertainment, and although the film fails on many fronts, I cannot fault his efforts.This is the kind of a film that does not have a script, it has a checklist. It introduces and disposes of so many characters, that we really don't care about a single one. One is tempted to make a list of the overused clichés: - the workaholic scientist dad who has a theory that no-one will listen to - the loving ex-wife with a noble career - the whacky homeless guy with a dog (which really, I thought they would eat) - the estranged son who just wants to hang with dad, so bad that he enjoy being stranded at sea just outside of Iceland - the nerdy yet somehow vivacious love interest of the son, complete with the rivalry from the rich, handsome private school guy hitting on her - the oriental female scientist, who really believes the theory - the heartless right-wing politicians - the British soccer fans - and most shamelessly, the bald-headed brave little dying kid that everyone forgets about.The plot holes in this move come at you with such fury, that your mind really just shuts off. Too many to even mention. But really, even in a movie this bad, can we be expected to suspend our disbelief to the point where a man walks from Philadelphia to NYC, in -100 degree temperature, in a blinding blizzard, no food, electricity or fuel, in a day or so? And we haven't even started talking about the librarian who would rather die than burn a book, the CGI wolves attacking three heroes searching for medicine on a Russian freightliner, the space station, the Japanese street vendors getting pelted by hailstones the size of a meatloaf or attempt to rescue the Queen.Whoever would consider this film a warning to the mindless burners of fossil fuels and shameless bar-b-q-ers of steaks must really give their own heads a major league shake. If anything, The Day After Tomorrow is such a far fetched plot that is mocks the environmental movement. Take away the awesome special effects and you can use the script for a sketch on Saturday Night Live.Still the destruction of LA and NYC are well done and exciting and in spite of everything, I did find this movie a little endearing. Not that I will recommend it, but I can't dismiss it either. *1/2 our of ****.",4,0,1,9 June 2004
Capote," A Performance That Overshadows a Great Film
","It will be interesting to see how history treats this film, whether or not this will be Philip Seymour Hoffman's Dog Day Afternoon, Silence of the Lambs or Raging Bull. Whether it will be held with history's truly great performances. I think it should be, and likely will.Capote is a great film, well made from every aspect, with a strong supporting cast, tight script and engaging story, but it is all overshadowed by one of the best performances in a decade or more. PSH inhabits Capote, his cartoon-like voice, mannerisms, paranoia, ego, gestures. This is made all the more amazing by the fact that this movie is not a hero-worship picture - it tells a generally unflattering tale of a man who was willing to go to any extent to finish his book.Capote tells the tale of the writing of In Cold Blood, the first 'non-fiction novel', entertainment reading based on an entirely true story. Capote travels to the small southern town to write about the brutal murder of a family of four. How it affected the townspeople. He soon finds that he has a novel in the making. One that would make him the most famous writer in America, stop his prolific career and hasten his death.By chance, Capote meets one of the accused killers, Perry Smith. A lonely and confused man, mistreated as a child but with many hidden gifts. Truman views him as a kindred spirit saying 'Its as if we grew up in the same house.' But the dilemma strikes - if the novel is to be completed, then Perry (whom Capote has at least inwardly fallen in love with) and his partner in crime must be put to death.Although we know how this will end for both Smith and Capote, the journey is extraordinary as we watch the manipulation on both sides of the jail cell. In the background is Nell Harper (Cahterin Keener) Capote's friend gaining notoriety for To Kill A Mockingbird. (Capote says of the film at its premier 'I don't see what the fuss is all about.') She acts as the films moral centre, telling Capote the truth about himself, which he knows but does not want to hear.PSH deserved an Oscar nomination two years back for Owning Mahowny and I implore anyone as gripped by his performance here as I was to seek that small film out.Capote is a worthy best picture nominee on its own, made better by a lead acting performance for the ages. **** out of ****",9,1,1,14 April 2006
Lost in Translation," Slow Moving, But Outstanding
","Lost In Translation was easily the most critically acclaimed movie of 2003. moviecitynews.com placed in on more Top 10 lists that any other film, including Return of the King and Mystic River. It is a small budget, low key film, made sparsely, filmed in a casual and meandering style, in which nothing really happens. Bill Murray is Bob Harris, an action movie star on the decline of his career. Unlike many of his colleagues, he has been married to the same woman for many years. He is in Tokyo for a commercial shoot for a Whiskey company. He will be paid very well, but laments that he should be somewhere else doing a play or something worthwhile.Scarlett Johansson is Charlotte, a young, beautiful girl, recently graduated from an Ivy League school and recently married to a workaholic photographer. She is in Japan to accompany her husband on a photo shoot, and possibly to discover herself. She is neglected and hurting and really does not know why.In a lesser film or a less insightful one, Bob and Charlotte would meet, fall in love, sleep together and run off in the end while Celine Dion belts out a ballad over the end credits. But Lost In Translation is not that film. It is an intense, deeply moving, deliberately paced character study that doesn't tell a story as much as it reveals it.Bob and Charlotte have a series of accidental meetings early in the film. This is intertwined with some flat out hilarious scenes of Bill Murray trying to relate to a Japanese commercial director, and Charlotte touring Tokyo. Eventually, the talk, dine, and spend all of their time together. The bulk of the film has the camera follow the two leads through the Tokyo night life while they meet people, go to parties, a hospital emergency room, a strip club and sushi restaurant. Many people I have spoke to about this film found it tedious to the point of being nearly unwatchable. To enjoy Lost In Translation, you have to appreciate not only dialogue but circumstance. This film spends most of its time letting the audience draw their own conclusions about what the leads are thinking and feeling. The ending typifies this technique, and you will either be deeply emotionally moved or completely dissatisfied. I loved this movie. I loved it for the way it slowly reveals the relationship with the two main characters, and allows us to draw our own conclusions. See it and judge for yourself. **** out of ****.",9,0,1,15 March 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Perfectly Executed, Horribly Written
","Dear Mr. Lucas.Please direct and produce films and stop writing. You are a great visionary but you are not funny and you have no romantic or passionate sensibility. Please stick to your strengths and hire a writer for Episode III. You can afford it. Yours truly, danb-4.That sums this movie up for me. As dumb as Phantom Menace, maybe even dumber, but wow, what a ride. This movie was so much fun to watch and very entertaining. The much maligned romantic plot between Anakin and whats-her-name deserves all the bashing it is getting and more. And the pitiful attempts at comedy with 3CPO and the 'witty banter' between Obiwan and Anikan are so bad they hurt.But, unlike Episode I, there is more that enough style to make up for the lack of substance. The rain planet and the aliens that make the clones are the best thing this series has put on screen. There are great action sequences and the extended use of Yoda was very gratifying.
As Yoda says to Count Dookoo, 'Much to learn, you still have.' Mr. Lucas should heed these words himself. He cannot write. If you look for plot and character substance in this film, you will be gravely disappointed. The romantic scene between Anakin and Padme where he talks about sand is so bad, it looks like it was cut from a Naked Gun film.See this on a digital screen if you get the chance. I saw this in Waterloo Ontario at the Galaxy Cinema and the entire film was crisp and sharp from corner to corner, with brilliant sound and sound editing. I cannot give Attack of the Clones too high a rating, but it is a movie that will need to be seen on a big screen. Go and enjoy - making fun of it later will be part of the fun. *** out of ****.",8,0,1,28 July 2002
"Monsters, Inc."," Fun and Entertaining, but Not a Classic
","Pixar has released its first mediocre film with Monsters Inc. Don't get me wrong, I loved it. But it lacked the sense of wonder of Toy Story, the character strength of A Bug's Life and the zest of Toy Story 2. This movie has some great scenes and fills the screen with wonderful images, but it falls short of its predecessors.Maybe living up to the first three Pixar features is an impossible task.Monsters Inc. has a wonderfully original premise. Monstropolis, the land where monsters live, generates its power from the screams of children. Monsters Inc. is a power plant where the most talented 'scarers' pop through closest doors though a portal into a child's bedroom anywhere on earth. They scare, the kids scream, the monsters leave and Monstropolis has their power. A problem arises - kids just don't scare that easy any more. Only the top scarers are getting results. (As the ads say 'We scare, because we care.')There are two masterworks of animation in this film. The first is Billy Crystals character, Mike, who is essentially an eyeball with legs and arms. But even with these limited features, Mike still has phenomenal body language and facial expressions. The second is Waternoose, the boss at Monsters Inc voiced by James Cockburn. Waternoose is this giant, multi-eyed thing in a business suit that creeps along on crab legs, but projects the image of 'the boss' while still being creepy. Amazing.I found Randall, the villain, just not bad enough. To be a Disney villain, you have to live up to the standards set by the likes of Ursula, Uncle Scar, the Wicked Witch and Jafar and Randall just doesn't cut it.Still a strong recommendation for this film. There are some fabulous visuals, most notably the wild ride through the warehouse of doors, and it sports a very original premise and works it well. I will never think of the number 2319 the same ever again.***1/2 out of ****.",8,1,2,18 November 2001
The Godfather: Part II," The Greatest Film Ever Made
","The original Godfather is a brilliant work. It is in a sense a voyeuristic delight, allowing us to see the mafia from the inside - we become part of the family. It single-handedly change the world's view of organized crime, and created a cast of sympathetic characters, none of whom have a shred of common morality. It was the highest grossing movie of its time and Brando created a cultural icon whose influence resonates as strong today as it did in 1972.As extraordinary an achievement as this is, Part II is even better. It easily receives my nod as the best picture ever made. I have seen it at least 20 times, and each time its 200 minutes fly by.The movie uses flashbacks to brilliantly weave two tales. The main story is the reign of Michael Corleone as the world's most powerful criminal. Now reaping the benefits of legalized gambling in Las Vegas, Michael is an evident billionaire with an iron fist on a world of treachery.
Behind this, Director Francis Ford Coppola spins the tale of the rise of Michael's father, Vito, to the center of the New York mafia. It is these scenes that make the film a work of art. Without spoiling, I will simply say the Robert DeNiro as the young Vito is the best acting performance of all time, a role  for which he won a richly deserved Oscar.The screenplay is full of delicious little underworld nuggets ('Keep your friends close .....', 'I don't want to kill everyone, just my enemies'), while it blows a dense, twisted plot past you at a dizzying and merciless pace. The cinematography is depressing and atmospheric. The score continues in the eerie role of its predecessor, foretelling death and evil.All of this makes the movie great and infinitely watchable. But it's what's deeper inside this film ... what it is really about ... that is its true genius.The Godfather Part II is not really a movie about the mafia, it is a movie about a man's life long struggle. Michael controls a vast empire that is constantly slipping out of his hands. He grows increasingly distrustful and paranoid, and even shows signs that he hates his own life. Michael almost seems to resent the fact that he is a natural born crime lord, a man who puts the family business ahead of everything.The great Don Michael Corleone can never come to terms with one simple fact.... his father's empire was built on love and respect, Michael's empire is built on fear and violent treachery.See this movie. It's three-and-a-half hours very well spent.",10,424,526,7 May 1999
Fargo," Absolutely Perfect
","Fargo inspires a love-it-or-hate-it response. Most on the 'hate-it' side can't get past the violence or the northern accents. For me, it ranks solidly in my all-time top ten.Frances McDormand won an overdue and well-deserved Oscar for her role, but William H. Macy is at the center of this film. He plays such a dislikable, cloying worm that the image sticks with me when I see him in other films. But at the end, I still am able to sympathize with him, and truly feel sorry for his decent into the gutter. (There but for the grace of God go any of us).The plot is simple but it is the delivery that makes the movie great. Fargo takes you to a barren North Dakota winter and makes it come alive. The cinematography is amongst the best you will ever see, making interesting and captivating images out of nothing.Pay close attention to the final scene - it is pure genius. On the surface, it seems detached from the movie, but deep down, it is one of the great pieces of character development in film history. In two minutes of 'non-plot-related' dialogue, you learn a great deal about the main character - who she is inside.What a great movie. **** out of ****",10,0,0,21 June 1999
Notting Hill," Mixed Feelings
","WARNING: MILD SPOILERSI have mixed feelings about this movie. I'll say that I liked it and was disappointed at the same time.On one hand, there is a very touching tale about the high cost of fame. As cool as it may seem to be a movie star, I can't help but strongly believe that Tom Cruise or Julia Roberts long for a simple walk in the park. Maybe not, but having every move monitored by the world must grow tiresome. This side of the story, told through Julia Roberts autobiographical character Ana Scott is told well and poignantly.The love story is mishandled at every step. This film exists in that annoying parallel universe that Roger Ebert describes as the world 'where Julia Roberts can't get a date.' When Hugh Grant turns down Julia Roberts, I did not admire his integrity, I questioned his sanity.The love story portion of this film plays out exactly as you expect and takes forever to get there.That said, Hugh's friends and family provide some good chuckles, Alec Baldwin's cameo is wonderful and the movie gets a mild recommendation from me. Good date flick.  **1/2 out of ****.",6,0,1,29 August 2002
The Aviator," Excellent Biopic, but Mediocre Scorsese
","Don't get me wrong, I loved this film. And I would be delighted to see Martin Scorsese win Best Director and the film win Best Picture. But for Scorsese, this is (best case) his 5th best film (behind Goodfellas, Raging Bull, Taxi Driver and Mean Streets) and I will choke a bit if the Academy chooses to honour this after ignoring his masterpieces.This is an epic film with an intimate feel, in which the director makes no wrong choices. By concentrating on Howard Hughes' life from 1927 to 1947, his glory years before his long and pathetic decent, we get to see the legend and myth of Hughes and not the cartoon character.As The Aviator opens, Hughes has recently inherited his parents fortune and he seems bent on spending all of it to make Hell Angels, and World War I picture concentrating on spectacular flying scenes. We get to know the Hughes who was a mad risk-taker, a womanizer of Hollywood's most elite and a genius business man. (It is interesting to watch how he succeeds by a succession of near-bankruptcies).Intertwined with this are brief flashes of the madness to come - his battle with OCD and his sickening obsession with germs. For a drink, he orders milk, in the bottle, seal on. And when he is enjoying his dinner, he is nearly ill when someone picks a single pea off of his plate.If this film wins an Oscar, it will be Cate Blanchett for her stunning portrayal of Katherine Hepburn. Blanchett brings to life the accent, quirky tomboy behaviour and irreverence that made Hepburn a legend off the screen.For all the CGI and special effects in this film, its greatest scenes are person to person, most notably the senate hearings. Alan Alda is perfect as Senator Brewster, a crooked politician who is trying to bring down Hughes to advance his own career. Their lunch meeting leading up to the hearings and the time they spend across the table on National TV are the movies best moments.Martin Scorsese is one of the great directors for brining out performances and this film is no exception. Leonardo DiCaprio avoids many opportunities to overact in this film, and creates Hughes as a complex and puzzling man slowly slipping away from reality. Supporting roles from Alec Baldwin as the president of Pan Am and John C. Reilly as Hughes' hapless business manager, keep the film from dragging.For fans of aviation scenes, you may never find a better picture. Much of the film's budget has been spent recreating some of Hughes more ambitious inventions and failures. The crashing of his prototype spy plane into a Hollywood residential neighbourhood may be the single greatest plane crash scene ever filmed, not because of the plane crashing, but because of the different perspectives that are shown.This by no means Martin Scorsese's best film, but it is his best since Goodfellas and it is a great movie. ***1/2 out of ****.",9,0,3,8 January 2005

I loved this film. I had not read the books and it mercilessly left in the dust, but no matter. from sheer craftsmanship and filmmaking, it can be enjoyed. The special edition DVD is a must own.There is so much skill, care and (yes, I'll say it) love put into this film, that it is hard not to like. It requires a knowledge of the books, but that can be gained. Peter Jackson set out with a nearly impossible task of bringing Middle Earth to life and triumphed.I cannot call this in the all time top ten, but I think that in time, the three films will be viewed together as one of the most important event is film history. **** out of ****.",10,2,3,13 January 2003
Grease," My wife would leave me for John Travolta
","This is my wife's favorite movie mostly because of John Travolta. But is also has a massive appeal in a lot of other areas.Grease's charm lies mainly in the fact that it doesn't take itself too seriously. It is happy to be a goofy musical about a time that never really existed - it presents the 50's like a silly cartoon but makes it work and takes you along for the ride. Just sit back and enjoy.Parents be warned - there is more vulgarity in this movie than its sugar-coated surface would let you believe. (Trivia - Sonny mumbles something at the principal in dialect Italian. Any guesses? He ain't complementing her perfume).I love Grease - its ham-handed, corny, silly and 100% pure fun. ***1/2 out of ****.",8,0,1,14 June 1999
Cast Away," Two Movies In One
","Cast Away was two films - one that I very much liked sandwiched between two that I found dull.As it opens, Chuck Noland (Hanks) is a time obsessed slightly rotund Fed Ex executive. He has everything is life - a good family, a good job, a nubile girlfriend (Hunt). He leaves on Christmas eve for an undefined emergency and has to fly overseas. The plane goes down and the meat of the movie begins.The second act of Cast Away is brilliant. Hanks is marooned on a island after the plane crash and director Robert Zemeckis makes some very daring moves to strand us with him. No music. Noe other characters. No animals to befriend. And most importantly, no flashbacks to life back home without him. The only other cast member is a volleyball that Hanks uses to maintain his sanity.The acting here is particularly great, since it is so isolated. We get to sense the various stages that he goes through - shock, desperation, survival, a touch of insanity. This is a performance that truly draws you in.From this point the movie slides down a rather slippery slope of mediocrity largely due to the performance of Hunt. I have seen Cast Away a few times, and I am so exhilarated by the second act and so let down by the third. See it for yourself and you can judge.Still, the Cast Away's middle act occupies the lion's share of the film and makes the entire experience more than worthwhile. *** out of ****.",Null,0,1,28 February 2004
American Beauty," A Worthy Best Picture
","A lot has been said about American Beauty. Many will find it offensive and unwatchable. It is a very worthy Oscar Winner, made even more remarkable by a rookie director.There are a million comments on this movie so suffice to say that I love it - it is one of the best films of the last 10 years. It is original and daring, and tells a tale that many, many people can relate to. Kevin Spacey's closing solioquy is screenwriting genius, and the cinematography is unique and breathtaking. Well filmed, acted, written and directed.See this film!!! **** out of ****.",Null,0,0,27 March 2001
Ocean's Eleven," Escapism
","Ocean's 11 is the kind of movie you want to watch when you want to be entertained, you want to think but you don't want to have to think, if that makes any sense.I would describe this as an 'honor amongst thieves' film in the line of The Sting, and of course its original predecessor. There are no good guys, just various levels of likable and dis-likable bad guys. The straightest arrow of the cast, casino owner Terrry Benedict (Garcia) is made to be the film most dis-likable character.The story is about Danny Ocean (Clooney), who is just released from prison. His first act is to break parole and the state for Las Vegas, where he meets up with his old buddy Rusty (Pitt). They decide that they want to do the impossible, knock over 3 casinos simultaneously, with their impenetrable security systems. They assemble a team of nine thieves, and the bulk of the movie is the caper itself.In spite of the star power, this is a skillfully made ensemble drama, with the likes of Don Cheadle, Elliot Gould, Julia Roberts and Andy Garcia all content in breezy supporting roles. The true joy of this film is watching the robbery unfold. Steven Soderberg does not make a single wrong directorial decision here.Ocean's 11 is a fun ride - a movie worth owning. It has zero social value, but at the same time, there is nothing really objectionable. It has a completely implausible plot, but we never care because it is wonderful escapist entertainment. ***1/2 out of ****.",8,0,0,15 June 2005
Saving Private Ryan," 'This Ryan better be worth it'
","Saving Private Ryan is an over-whelming thought provoking film which takes the baton from Platoon as the standard for war movies. Not that it is necessarily better, but it certainly raised the bar in technical achievement and graphic violence.Another winning combination of Janusz Kaminski and Spielberg, the technical achievement of the opening act (D-Day invasion) is worthy of all the praise and awards the movie garnered. Spielberg again shows us, as in 'Schindler's List', his unique way of depicting violent death as something that happens to real people, not simply a cool effect to rid the plot of bad guys. This 25 to 30 minutes of the film is one of filmmakings all-time great achievements. Spielberg's real genius in his 'serious' films is his knack for allowing us to enter inside and feel the chaos and emotions. SPR, Schindler's, The Color Purple and even Jaws surround you rather than hit you in the face.There is a line spoken by one of the soldiers shortly after they receive their seemingly inane assignment to rescue one man: 'This Ryan better be worth it'. A sort of prophetic statement that to me commented on the man, the mission and the film itself.A great film, for sure, but not perfect, and certainly not worthy of #7 on the IMDb top 250. The script is a little too clean and clever for a bunch of kids thrown into combat, and it so, so violent and depressing that it is physically exhausting. I feel that after the stellar and gut-wrenching opening act, SPR never lives up to the standard it sets for itself.However, if the opening and closing acts are even 1% accurate in their depiction of combat, then this movie should be used as war deterrent.Not Spielberg's best, but certainly a noble film and a technical watershed in movie making.***1/2 out of ****.",9,0,0,25 September 1999
The Little Mermaid," Perfect
","The Little Mermaid revitalized animation and Disney. The art form had vacillated quite badly in the 80's but this film came along and once again proved that an animated film can be fun, entertaining and worthy of critical acclaim all the same time.A film in this genre needs to be judged by the characters, songs and imagery. Here we have them all at peak form. 'Kiss the Girl' and 'Under the Sea' are two of the best Disney Songs ever. Sebastian and Flounder and the lovable, timeless comic relief sidekicks. And the images - Disney still has not and may never top the sequence to the two aforementioned songs.But no animated film is can be great without a great villain, and Ursula the Sea Witch is one of the greats. Smarmy, sarcastic, evil, vengeful, arrogant, funny and everything else she needs to be, the character is brilliantly voiced by Pat Carroll and sings the single best ever Disney Villain song - 'Poor Unfortunate Souls'.Recently watching Shrek, Monsters Inc and Toy Story 2, I found it amazing that the most recognizable name in the credits for Little Mermaid is Buddy Hackett. Voice-over has been come hotly sought after work for A-list actors (just look at Shrek!) and they have this movie to thank.I love The Little Mermaid. My wife and I saw it when we were dating and then I got to go again on the re-release with my daughter. It is a treat to be enjoyed over and over again.**** out of ****.",10,2,3,18 November 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Better Than FOTR
","It is very difficult to imagine the task that lay ahead of 38 year old Peter Jackson, when we went off to simultaneously film all the LOTR entries. It is amazing that anyone would green light a $300MM project like this. FOTR was nearly perfect and TTT is even better - a masterpiece if I may use a tired word. JRR Tolkien gave us this world, and Peter Jackson has brilliantly brought it to life.In every measure I can name, this film is equal to or superior to its predecessor. Effects, dialogue, battles, action, intrigue, and of course Gollum. The battle of Helm's Deep, which occupies most of the third act of this film, is tour-de-force. Every computer generated character is believable and there are more kills on the battlefield than in Braveheart.Special mention must be made of two of the CGI characters. Gollum is perhaps the most fascinating creature I have seen. Pathetic and sympathetic, repulsive and lovable all at once. The best scene takes place when Gollum converses with his evil self. The other is Treebeard, the wise Ent, the shepherd of the forest, a talking tree that rises to battle to defend and avenge his brethren. The scene where one of the battling Ents dunks his head in the flood waters to extinguish himself is one the films great moments.You can argue until you are blue in the face whether or not this is true to the book. That's irrelevant. We are fortunate to be witnessing a trilogy that will be regaled as one of movie history's key events. This is the only sequel in recent memory that surpassed its predecessor at the box office, which is proof of the fact that it is a better, more engaging and more entertaining film. **** out of ****.",10,0,0,14 January 2003
Schindler's List," A Tragic, Inspiring, Important Film
","I almost dare not 'review' or 'comment' on this film. However, I  will, because this is a film everyone should see. It is dramatic, emotional and noble, and handles the most difficult subject of the 20th century without giving a sermon.Schindler's List is clearly Speilberg's best - the best he will ever do - and is one the great films of all time. It is an experience, not just a movie. Those who hate it or dislike it, I challenge you to watch it again and question your feelings. Did it disturb you? Did it frighten you? I think that it is near impossible to dislike this movie - only to be bothered by it.The fact is that this film deals in truth. It graphically portrays a dark, dark chapter in human history, and provides deep insight into the role hatred played in WWII. This is a movie that will make you question the world we live in and make you feel sorry to be a part of the species that let this happen.Note also, that there is no great sermon on why genocide is wrong or why the Nazis must be stopped. Schindler's heart is opened by what he sees and experiences - no-one needs to tell him that killing is wrong.Pretty bleak, but pretty accurate. But under the thematic elements is a great film. Extraordinary acting, especially Ralph Fiennes as the psychotic Amon Goeth. Janusz Kaminky's cinematography is amongst the best ever seen.Without spoiling, I can say that this is the singularly most horrifying movie I have ever seen. It disturbed me for days. I recommend this movie to everyone. It will entertain you, but also educate you, but mostly, it is an important film that will make you examine your own life. As dark as it is, this is a movie of hope and survival. **** out of ****.",Null,9,13,20 September 1999
The Incredibles," Possibly Pixar's Best
","Pixar is six for six with the Incredibles. All six films have been smash hits, but more importantly, all six have been wonderful films. And every time they step up to the plate, they just hit it further out of the park.The Incredibles is not Pixar's most visually compelling film (Finding Nemo is, by far), but it is the most entertaining, the funniest and the most mature. It cleverly combines incredibly realistic backgrounds with obviously cartoonish characters, to give the film and sense of realism and great comedy at the same time.Mr. Incredible is a happy super-hero, engaged to the sexy Elasti-girl, and with his best friend Frozone, he lives a wonderful life. Until one day, he saves a would-be building jumper who, just plainly did not want to be saved. This opens up a rash of lawsuits against superheroes, and forces the government to relocate them (a la the Witness Protection Program), and in exchange, the heroes will just stop being heroes.The Incredibles now live as Bob and Helen Parr with their three kids, all of who have powers of their own. Violet, who can disappear and create forcefields, is entering that awkward teen stage of life. Her younger brother, Dash, can, as his name implies, move with lightning speed and only know how to use this ability to annoy. The baby, Jack Jack, has powers that are yet to be discovered.Bob is a claims clerk at an insurance company, with a nasty boss (brilliant small role by Wallace Shawn) and he is just plain bored. He sneaks out at night and with the help of Frozone and a police radio, still fights crimes.The Incredibles deals so well with mid-life crisis, that one can scarcely believe that it is primarily a kids movie. Bob's hair is receding, his belly bulging and his mind longing for the past. That is why he cannot resist the call when a mysterious woman contacts him and offers him a job that only Mr. Incredible can solve.From this point, the film is just one delight after another. From Edna, the costume lady (a less-that-subtle tribute to costume legend Edith Head) to the far away island where an evil villain is plotting his master plan, to the ingenious ways the powers are put to use, this is a movie that does not take a misstep. This film is scarier than the previous Pixar offerings, but not too instense for young children.The best scenes in this movie are when the kids discover the extent of their powers and learn to put them to use. Like any kid in an awkward situation, they are shy, timid, and shocked when things go right. Also pay close attention to Elasti-girl when she is caught in between sliding doors.In the simplest of terms, The Incredibles is an animated super-hero movie, but it creates complete characters and wonderfully unique situations. Like all good superheroes, The Incredibles have flaws and short-comings that get in the way of their powers. I cannot recommend this movie enough. **** out of ****.",10,0,1,8 January 2005
Dog Day Afternoon," Pacino's Best, Lumet's Best
","This is a love-it-or-loathe it film. I love it. It ranks very high on my all-time best list.Pacino has (rightfully) received two-and-a-half decades of accolades for his role as Sonny, the loser bank robber without the wit to hold up a Dunkin' Donuts, let alone a bank. Pacino may have won his Oscar for 'Scent of a Woman', but this is the role he will be remembered for.But there are two key points to this film that often go overlooked. The first is John Cazale as Sal. Slow-witted and along for the ride, he is just as prepared to kill anyone who moves as he is to take a nap. Cazale was a gifted actor who only made five films before his untimely death - all five were best picture nominees and three of them won. This rivals his roles as Fredo for his best work.(Nods also go to Chris Sarandon and Charles Durning for their crucial supporting roles).The other fascinating point about this movie is its simplicity. It is essentially played out on one set and told like it is in real time, but it never really drags and it always finds a way of keeping your interest. Director Sydney Lumet creates an uneasy tension throughout this film that gnaws at you and makes you writhe in your seat. It has a walloping impact that lingers with you for days.This is a great story, skillfully directed with astonishing performances. **** out of ****.",9,4,5,9 May 1999
Amadeus," Not great history, but great entertainment
","Oh, how I love this film. F. Murray Abraham's Oscar-winning portrayal of Salieri alone makes this film infinitely watchable. I saw this at the age of 19 and walked out of the theater and for the first time said to myself, 'This is the best movie I have ever seen.' It currently sits high in my all-time top ten.Don't go looking for history retold. Few true stories re-told accurately make great films. But the creative liberties taken here add spice, intrigue and drama and do not detract one bit from the film.One of the great achievements of filmmaking and the best scene in this picture has Mozart, weakened by fever, essentially dictating his Requiem to Salieri. As the movement builds from Mozart's imagination, we can see Salieri finally accept the extent of his true genius. That is certainly director's Milos Forman's finest hour - especially when you stop to consider how badly that could have played out.I think that those of use who grew up musicians appreciate this movie more, not because of Mozart, but because we can relate to the searing hatred and jealously of Salieri. For all of us, no matter how hard we tried, there was always someone better.This movie translates poorly to the small screen, as do most epics - but it is still a worthwhile rental. Here you will see the peak of Forman's, Abraham's and Hulce's career, played out with a little bit of history and heaps of extraordinary entertainment.   Without question,  **** out of ****.",10,3,7,6 September 1999
Moulin Rouge!," Original and Over the Top
","Moulin Rouge is a daring, over the top film that does not spare any amount of excess, take itself at all seriously or stick to any movie conventions. It could have ended up a wretched exercise in self indulgence and overkill, but instead emerges a modern classic. There are many vastly varying comments on this film. Some disparage the plot line for its simplicity and lack of originality. To these people I say rent the DVD, read about the film and watch it closely. It was absolutely intended to be a simple love story told through the medium of song. (This completes Baz Luhrmann's previous efforts, telling a love story through dance in Strictly Ballroom and spoken word in Romeo and Juliette). Some also did not like the reused music. This is something you will either love or hate. I loved it, particularly because they chose my wedding song (Elton John's Your Song) as the key song of the love story, ever-so-slightly re-written. If the Elephant Love Medley does not put a smile on your face, then you are in desperate need of a long holiday.The movie is brilliantly cast with Nicole Kidman as Santine, the courtesan who breaks her greatest vow, never to fall in love, Ewan McGregor as Christain, the 'penniless writer' who believes that love is life's greatest gift and Richard Roxbough, who makes the film with his role as the insanely jealous Duke trying to buy Santine's affections.Will love win over money? Will Santine and Christain finally admit their feelings? Will the Duke be shunned? Will the show go on? Is the Pope catholic? These questions are not important to the movie's success. The screen is crammed with images and action, every dance number leaves nothing on the table and it is all played bursting with life. I loved this movie.Nicole Kidman is at the peak of her career here, carrying this ambitious film on her shoulders. As beautiful as any woman on Earth, she is a delight to watch as her character effortlessly transforms from performer to lover to seductress to businesswoman to ailing patient. She covers every range, sings, dances and looks perfect. An Oscar is not unreasonable, and no nomination would be a crime.See this film. Leave your plot-following, analytical senses at the door and go along for the ride. This is one of the best films of the past 10 years. **** out of ****.",10,0,1,29 December 2001
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," If You Admire the Craft of Film-making, this one's for you.
","Good Night and Good Luck enters into the territory of films like Appolo 13 and to a certain extent even Revenge of the Sith which tell an intensely compelling story to which everyone knows the ending. It is an unenviable task, to be certain. We know the start and end, what we are interested in is the details. GN&GL is an engaging, skillfully made period piece which make no bad decisions.Telling the story of the fabled and public battle of Edward R. Murrow and Senator Joe McCarthy, director and co-start George Clooney does a near perfect job of transporting the audience back to the 50s. An age when America's most respected news anchor would still smoke on TV. When communism was what terrorism is today.The key to this film is casting McCarthy as himself, using only newsreel footage and actual McCarthy speeches and quotes, rather than having him played by an actor. This gives a documentary-like authenticity to this film that it would otherwise never have and it is the key to its success.The film portrays Murrow as an intelligent man, defender of freedom of the press, eloquent and of the highest integrity, which he was. It portrays McCarthy as an likely-insane demagogue, power hungry and exploiting fear, which he was. In other words, it completely succeeds in re-telling the tale. David Straithairn, long an underrated character actor adds great depth to what could have been a one note performance as Murrow.GN&GL is, however, style over substance and craft over content. It does not stray even the slightest from its mission, and thereby may prove to be a little dull for some viewers. If you are the type who can watch a movie and appreciate it for its skill, then this is worth watching. ***1/2 out of ****.",8,0,0,14 April 2006
Shrek 2," Excellent, But Inferior to the Original
","There are two things missing from Shrek 2 that the original had. The first is John Lithgow - what a great villain. Lord Farquaad made the movie with his arrogant, smarmy attitude, and the way he went about seemingly unaware of his height. The second is the sense of wonderment that the original gave us with its cutting edge animation. Shrek 2 has a little bit of 'been-there-done-that' attached to it.The open scene is outstanding. Shrek and Fiona are newlyweds and enjoying there new life together. In a matter of minutes, the pop-culture references fly by. Lord of the Rings, Spiderman, The Little Mermaid, Jaws and even From Here to Eternity are parodied. Its quite wonderful.Shrek and Fiona receive notice that they are to travel to the land of Far Far Away to meet Fiona's parents, voiced by Julie Andrews and the immensely underused John Cleese. Donkey comes along for the ride and in the first act of the movie, provides nearly all the laughs. The villain this time around is the fairy godmother, who had hopes of her own son, the spoiled and whiny Prince Charming, marrying Fiona, and now wants things set straight.Of the new characters, the best is clearly Antonio Banderas' Puss-n-Boots, a swashbuckling Kitty that is a beautiful send up of his own turn as Zorro. The Fairy Godmother is given lots of cute quirks like an eating disorder, but I found her to be annoying.I attended Shrek 2 with my two youngest children, age 4 and 8, and they were thoroughly entertained. The movie was not as frightening as the original, and even though it brims with nudge-nudge jokes for the adults, there are plenty of gags for the kids. It will be a movie to see several times to catch all the little gags. For example, when King Harold is given the Love Potion to give to Fiona, there is a little 'IX' (#9) on the bottle. Or the Land of Far Far Away's coffee shop, Farbucks, and the fact that there are two across the road from eachother.I would have to heartily disagree with anyone who feels that Shrek 2 is a better film than Shrek. It is not as funny, drags a bit and has a couple of complete klunker scenes (the giant gingerbread man). It is still better than most movies in the multi-plex circuit and most worthy of your $12. ***1/2 out of ****.",9,0,0,10 June 2004
Black Hawk Down," Single Minded War Film
","This is a truly single minded film. The purpose here is to do nothing more than, as accurately as possible, recreate a terribly failed US military action. Those who call this pro-war propoganda saw the wrong film. This movie pulls no punches in its belief that the mission was a failure and the US presence in Somalia was questionable at best.Ridley Scott is a good at the epic as anyone. And here, he has cleansed himself of characters and plot and stuck with the book almost real time. From minute one, we are tossed mercilessly into the streets and markets of Mogadishu and left stranded with the cast. Black Hawk Down is a major technical achievement, and though I was suprised to see it win two Oscars, I felt they were earned.This movie cannot be compared to Platoon, SPR, Born on the Fourth of July or most other war movies for that matter. It focuses solely on a mission and a failed one at that. For me, if this movie brought any message to the screen, it was that America did not know what it was doing in Somalia. But don't trust my opinion. This is a film worth seeing and judging for yourself. **** out of ****.",9,0,0,25 March 2002
Singin' in the Rain," Perfect Entertainment
","What can be said about Singin' in the Rain that hasn't been said 1,000 times before. Great songs, sappy romance, eye-popping dance sequences and some great comic relief make this infinitely watchable.If you haven't seen the Make'em Laugh dance sequence, then their is a great void in your life. Donald O'Connor will be permanently engraved in your brain after viewing this film - it is positively wonderful.Is it the best musical of all time? Most say yes, but I like West Side Story better, primarily because the music in WSS in incomparable. But WSS is dark and depressing, SITR is light and snappy and suitable for anyone.See this and see the Kelly-O'Connor combo its peak and one of the best works of art from Hollywood's golden age. **** out of **** (which is barely enough).",10,2,5,30 September 1999
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," The Most Original Romance Film I Have Seen
","What a brilliant, original and challenging film this is. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind likely falls into the category of romantic comedy, but that would put it on the same shelf as America's Sweethearts or Two Weeks Notice. This is immeasurably more.Charlie Kaufman is the prolific writer of quirky and bizarre screenplays. Since 1999, he has written three films (including this one) that you can strongly argue were the best pictures of the year. He writes unique and almost deliberately odd movies, but they never some across as weirdness for its own sake.How to describe the plot? (This is not a plot-driven film). Jim Carrey is Joel - as bit of a loser who lacks confidence in himself. Kate Winslet is Clementine, a blue haired off the wall kooky chick, the exact type that Joel should repel. They start a relationship and are in love.As the relationship goes sour, they have a quick and nasty break up. Clementine goes to firm that can erases memories and has Joel erased from her mind. Joel decides to do the same, but his memories of Clementine are so deeply entrenched that they refuse to go away easily.Kaufman and director Michel GOndry take this simple sounding premise, tell it in a non-linear format and take it in directions no viewer can predict. The result is a touching, haunting and moving emotional experience that will linger with you long after the film is over. If you liked Being John Malkovich and Adapation, chances are you will like Eternal Sunshine as well. This films could not be more different, but they have the common threads Kaufmans pen.Carrey and Winslet are backed up by an amazing support cast, including ELijah Wood, Kirten Dunst, Tom Wilkinson and Mark Ruffalo.Here you have a memory loss film where the characters choose to loose their memory. The film examines the moral, social and even logistic implications of this, without losing the nature of the romance. It takes every convention of it genre, chucks it out the window and starts from there. ***1/2 out of ****.",9,0,2,30 December 2005

He is aimlessly dragging a violin across his guitar, and stops to tune the violin.This movie is such a perfect send up of the lost days of arena rock that you will often feel that you are watching a documentary. Every line its perfectly believable.This movie is commonly labelled a 'cult classic', which is a shame, because it is one of the great comedies of all time. The dialogue is absolutely brilliant. It is lively and funny, but at the same time tells the tale of aging rockers refusing to believe that they are past their prime.Pay close attention to the names of the band's past albums.Still ranks as Rob Reiner's best. **** out of ****.",Null,0,2,7 May 1999
Pulp Fiction," A Refreshing Assault on the Senses
","One of the best independent film ever made, Pulp Fiction is a towering achievement while not really being any good at all. It is a dirty, edgy film which is essentially about nothing other than what it feels like to be in this situation. It is reminiscent of Goodfellas, which has that same almost documentary-like feel to it, and has no definable plot.At the centre of this film however is the acting. Quentin Tarantino draws every ounce of life out of each character and creates an endless series of freaks that you would love to study , but would never want to know. A lot of talk surrounded John Travolta's Oscar loss in this film to Tom Hanks, but it was Samuel L. Jackson who was robbed. He eats the screen alive in every scene - the most famous being in the diner at the end but the best being the hit on Brett ('Check out the big brain on Brett') in the first scene after the credits. Even Bruce Willis fits his role as a scheming low-life boxer perfectly.The non-linear story telling and campy feel to this movie work, and make it come across like a crude mating of a 70's cop show, blaxpoitation and a soap opera. But the sharp, witty, original and daring screenplay never misses it's target and not a single scene comes off as forced or awkward.The violence in this movie got a lot of attention at its release, but you cannot convince me that it has anything worse than an episode of NYPD Blue. It really is not that violent. The scenes with Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames and 'the gimp' are truly offensive and tough to watch, but they are not that violent. That being said, the f-shots in this movie are countless.When you first view Pulp Fiction, so much is thrown at you in such an unconventional way that you may well dislike the film. Give it a second or even third chance. It is well worth it. Pay close attention to the cameos - they make the film. **** out of ****.",9,0,0,31 May 1999
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Fun and Frighteneing
","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a wonderful film. Loking back, Chris Columbus, the great pop film maker, deserved an Oscar nomination for this film. THere are no wrong choices, showing the world of Hogwarts from Harry's eyes, letting us discover this strange and scary world with him.It is by no means violent and is as scary as it needs to be. Most children will be able to handle this film and sleep soundly the same night.What I love about the movie, more than the CGI and special effects, is the building of the relationshio with Ron, Hermoine and Harry. Really, they are three outcast nerds and in spite of Harry's celebrity and power and new found wealth, he chooses them for friends forsaking the likes of the other rich kids. It is a subtle but very strong positive message for kids.In spite of its running length it can easily hold a child's attention, jumping from trolls to dragons to goblins to quiddich matches, mixing it all in with moments of trues pathos as Harry discovers the truth about his family. Daniel Radcliffe succeeds in portraying Harry as a likable, flawed, emerging hero, fascinated with his own power, but keeping everything in check. (one of the great achievements of this film is how well it is cast, considering the huge number of speaking roles).Aside from a little uneven acting from the young newcomers in the cast, this film does not strike a wrong note. ***1/2 out of ****.",8,0,1,30 December 2005
The Godfather: Part III," Works Better Than It Should
","Godfather II and I are number I and II on my all-time movie list respectively. There are timeless, awesome, skillful films worthy of their Oscars and accolades. GIII does not make my top 25.That's not to say it is a bad film. It is quite good. But take away these rich, wonderful characters and links to the previous classics and you have a long and confusing film.The plot is well known - patriarch Michael Corleone's attempts to buy his way out of the criminal empire he built and ruthlessly ruled, thwarted by his enemies and his bloodthirsty, power-hungry nephew Vincent(brilliantly played by Andy Garcia), who is poised to take command of the family business. There is also the strong theme of Michael's guilt for his past offenses, most notably the murder of his brother.It is a sad a grim tale, with what I thought was a very satisfying ending. Without spoiling, lets just ask this question - does a life long criminal and murderer deserve any better?The movie's best scene takes place when Michael sees the wise and powerful Cardinal Lamberto and receives a reluctant absolution of his sins. I love this scene because the Cardinal understands him so well, and knows that he can be more than he is, but won't.The movie has a flaw which comes very close to ruining it completely - and that is of course the infamous casting of Soffia Coppola in the pivotal role of Michael's daughter, Mary. A great deal of this plot revolves around the passionate, dangerous love of Vincent and Mary and it simply does not work. She lumbers around on the screen like an amateur and destroys every scene she has. I never bought in for a second that Vicent cared at all about her as anything more than a trick.All that said, Diane Keaton, Eli Wallach and Joe Mantegna all offer wonderful supporting roles. Talia Shire shines again as Connie. The script is great and the theme of the trilogy is very clear - don't take sides against the family. I value this film a great deal primarily because it does a great job of winding up the story of Michael. Do not see this first, see the three in order.***1/2 out of ****.",Null,1,2,21 May 2001
A Beautiful Mind," Expertly Crafted, Entertaining Film
","It is shameful the way  so many people feel it is their duty to nitpick great films, and can only do so by creating a laundry list of other movies they like. This is a wonderful movie, moving and entertaining. How accurate a representation of John Nash it is is totally irrelevant. Movies are an entertainment medium and in that sense, this film is a total triumph.And it is Russell Crowe's triumph. Crowe is on a role as of late garnering three consecutive Oscar nominations. He clearly won for the wrong film. This role is tour de force. He loses himself so deeply in the character so convincingly that I found myself in his mentally ill world believing everything I experienced.Ron Howard unfolds this moving brilliantly. I won't give away secrets, but the less you know about it going in the better. This movie does let you into the mind of its lead character and really makes you consider your own perceptions and realities. Are we really here? Am I really typing. Picking apart this film for minute factual content or leaving out alleged details of the main characters sexuality is totally churlish and unnecessary.See and love this movie. It works completely well as a piece of stand alone fiction inspired by a true story. Jennifer Connelly is stunning as usual (I question an Oscar for her, but she is effective) and there is a brilliant supporting role by the always enjoyable Ed Harris.A Beautiful Mind will stand in time as a worthy Best Picture. It has all the elements - acting, writing, beautifully filmed, a very unique score and skillful directing. I will own this DVD. **** out of ****",10,0,2,25 March 2002
When Harry Met Sally...," Great Romantic Comedy
","The good romantic comedy is a rare breed indeed. Many start off well, but then too drippy, too mean-spirited, or just plain unfunny. A movie that stays sweet, funny and good hearted from start to finish is to be cherished and this is it. When Harry Met Sally is one of those films that many people have seen a dozen times and still enjoy. It covers a period of a decade or so when Harry Burns (Crystal), a self confident, wordy, cynical writer first meets Sally Albright (Ryan) and uptight, perfectionist, a truly high maintenance woman. Or has Harry calls her, the worst kind, high maintenance who thinks she is low maintenance.They meet to drive to New York together, hate eachother, meet again in an airport five years later, hate eachother a little less then meet in a book store five years after that, to discover they have both been dumped and have more in common than they think.They become friends. They date and share experiences. They try to set eachother up with friends and then the inevitable happens. They spend the night together and we spend the balance of the film discovering whether or not their friendship was love, and if it can survive a night of sex.
This set the stage for all other Nora Ephron offerings. The movie does not miss its tone for a second. Rob Reiner keeps it funny, lets us in on the characters flaws, but at the same time, makes us care about them rather than be repulsed by them.I have seen this film at least 10 times and would watch it again in a heartbeat. It is likely the best date film of all time, and can be equally enjoyed by both sexes. It is funny  from the first frame to the last features a great soundtrack from Harry Connick. **** out of ****.",Null,1,4,28 September 2003
War of the Worlds," Stylish, but too nihilistic
","From Jerry Bruckheimer, I would have thought this to be an inferior film. From Spielberg, its an outright disaster.War of the Worlds is on par with Independence Day and that ludicrous Bruce Willis movie with the flying rock - big, ungainly loud moves that are still a financial success. It was easily the worst, and most disappointing film I saw in 2005.As goes with Spielberg, it is expertly made and has flashes of brilliance all over. Some of its best moments are in the few quiet ones. But for 90 nearly endless minutes, it is simply Tom Cruise and company yelling, running and watching everything around them get destroyed. I have never experienced the onslaught of senseless, plot less death from a Spielberg film that I got from this one.The ending has to be seen to be believed, and it is what elevates it from disappointing to downright bad. The script entirely forgets about the character of Tom Cruise's son, who seems to miraculously appear for the final scene. And miracle of miracle, the whole of the US eastern seaboard is annihilated, save for the block on which the mother of Cruise's children live.War of the Worlds received a lot a press for being made in a short time span and it feels rushed and unfinished. It is purely and exercise in special effects, a not a very good one. *1/2 out of ****.",3,1,1,29 December 2005
Jaws," A Great Horror Film and a Cultural Force
","There is no more instantly recognizable phrase of movie music. None. The low repetitive, tension building bass violin. No other movie has also so massively created paranioa. This movie ranks with The Godfather for shaping forever the public's perception of its central theme.The shark is not shown in this movie until about 2/3 of the way in and that is central to its horror. The ultimate enemy is the one you cannot see and cannot predict. This movie also lets you inside the sharks pysche, for lack of a better term, when oceanographer Dreyfuss gives his speech on the shark being 'the perfect engine'. A nonhuman villian is described in terms that we can understand and completely fear.There is a lot of small town hokeyness to this film. Robert Shaw is a little over the top (but great) and there is the perfunctory subplot of the mayor who doesn't want the beach closed in peak season. But is all works in the context of this groundbreaking, edgy film, which at the time, was the #1 grossing film of all time.I give the strongest recommendation to this film as a great piece of horror, but also as a view of the work of a young Speilberg. Required viewing for all movie fans - one of the best films ever made. **** out of ****.",10,1,2,29 September 2001
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Brilliant Effects, Great Story Arch, Lame Writing
","George Lucas is a great story teller and the undisputed master of creating special effects that serve a film. He cannot write, and Revenge of the Sith simply in the hands of a better writer could have been the best of the Star Wars Series. It is still excellent, third best of the six by my take (I rank them Empire, Hope, Sith, Clones, Jedi, Menace), but it misses an opportunity for greatness.There is really no way of spoiling the plot. The film has the great disadvantage that everyone who enters the theatre knows the ending. What we are looking for are the details of the trip.The movie opens with Obi Wan and Anakin on a quest to save Emperor Palpatine from captivity from the evil Sith Lord Count Dookoo. (It seems that Christopher Lee's new career is to play bit role evil villains in two part of a trilogy, only to get killed in the open scene of the third). What we know that the characters do not is that this was all set up, a test of Anakin's mastery of the force.Anakin becomes the Emperor's special envoy to the Jedi Counsel. The other members of the counsel refuse to give him the rank of master, which stirs up his hatred and anger and allows his rapid descent to the Dark Side of the force to begin.Sith gives us four moments of true greatness - Obi Wans light sabre fight with General Grevious, the volcano planet, Yoda's fight with Sidious and of course, the transformation to Darth Vader. The movie's weakness is its paint-by-numbers script which gives the exact minimum amount of dialogue required to move the script forward.Sith is a worthy, rousing operatic send off to the cinemas most celebrated story. Parents be warned, it is dark and violent, more so that any previous Star Wars. ***1/2 out of ****.",9,2,5,15 June 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," A Film With a Life of Its Own
","Shawshank is a favourite of the Imdb. Always in the top 5, lots and lots of positive comments. I personally know many people who call this their all-time favourite.I wont go that far, but it gets highest marks from me. Just see it. It is the simple tale of Andy, the wrongly-convicted straight-laced accountant and Red, the aging murderer he befriends in prison. They both enter and leave different people, and to truly appreciate this film, pay careful attention to that plot point. Who they are when they enter and who the are when they leave.This is not a perfect movie. It could have lost 20 minutes without taking away anything, and some of the dialogue is trite. But it is nonetheless powerful and moving.It was not a box office or a video hit. But slowly and surely, largely through this website, it has developed a large, loyal and ardent following. Even Roger Ebert has added it to this 'Great Movies' list, even though it did not garner four stars on its release and did not make his top 10 of the year.You will likely find that this movie will grow on you. It is very watchable and like a good wine, improves with age. **** out of ****.",9,0,0,21 May 2001
Platoon," What it feels like to be at war
","I saw this movie on its opening day in 1986 in great anticipation and was not disappointed. A movie truly worthy of the honor 'Best Picture', Platoon familiarized war without trivializing it.The effectiveness of this film lies almost entirely in its cinematography. We are chucked into the center of the Vietnam jungles with the soldiers and director Oliver Stone finds the exact method to re-create the chaos. We never see the enemy - unlike most other movies of its kind, Platoon keeps the enemy hidden and leaping at you from all corners. I sat in my chair, mouth agape and horrified within 10 minutes of the start of this movie and it is this simple technique that creates the effect.Platoon is a towering technical achievement and also an outstanding story of loyalty (personal and to your country) and betrayal - well acted and brilliantly cast.This is a film that will linger with you for months - in the same way Saving Private Ryan or Schindler's List did (or at least should have). Platoon is easily worthy of mention with those two films, or any other. **** out of ****.",Null,0,0,14 June 1999
Raging Bull," Outstanding!
","Raging Bull is routinely called the best film of the 80's, and many people call it the greatest film of all time. It certainly deserves those accolades and more. It ranks solidly in my all time top ten and is one of the most painful character studies in movie history.Raging Bull is about a boxer but it is not a boxing movie. In fact, I would be surprised if the fight scenes make up more than 15 minutes of the entire film. They are so brutal and so well done, they seem longer.Director Martin Scorsese has one of the most impressive C.V.s of any director, and I believe him to be the greatest filmmaker ever. Raging Bull is a work or directorial genius, but the film is primarily Robert DeNiro's triumph. It garnered him a well-deserved 2nd Oscar for this portrayal of a vicious, dislikable near-sociopath with an insane jealous streak and countless personal demons.In the movies best scene, DeNiro's Jake La Motta takes an absolute pummeling from Sugar Ray Robinson - he appears to be beaten nearly to death. But La Motta is still able to feel victorious, in a smug, insane sort of way as he staggers away, barely able to talk, grins at Robinson and says 'You never knocked me down, Ray.' This scene, for me, sums up the film. You see the best of the directing, editing, acting and special effects, combined with direct insight into La Motta's character. It is truly unforgettable. (This is another editing masterpiece by Thelma Schoonmaker, who also did Goodfellas and most of Scorsese's important work).Is this Scorsese's best film? IMHO, no, it ranks just behind Goodfellas. But it is still a great film - one of the best ever made.  This is an honest, raw and violent film, not for the faint of heart or seekers of fluffy endings. **** out of ****.",10,2,2,19 September 1999
Shrek," Funny, Entertaining and Completely Original
","It may be too early for me to tell, but Shrek just may unseat The Little Mermaid as my all-time favourite animated films. I benefited from knowing very little when I went to see the film. But when Shrek tears out a page from a Fairy Tale book to use as toilet paper and then goes pleasantly about his day to Smashmouths 'Allstar', I knew I was in for a treat.All four lead voices in this film are brilliant, but none more than John Lithgow as the diminutive Lord Farquaad. Farquaad is about three feet tall but does not seem to realize it, as if Lithgow was not told during the recording. But he is evil and arrogant and perfect. One of the best animation voice-overs ever. The choice to go with Mike Myers scottish brogue is the only thing in the film I would question, but then I cannot picture the lovable Shrek any other way.The plot is very simple. Shrek is enlisted by Lord Farquaad to rescue Princess Fiona from a dangerous dragon. Pretty standard fairy tale fare. Shrek agrees to do so in exchange for getting his beloved swamp back all to himself. He is joined by Donkey, voiced by Eddie Murphy who provides almost all the laughs. Shrek does not know that Farquaad and Fiona both have secrets.To tell anything more would be silly. The plot has little to do with this film. It is a visual feast with every inch of every frame jammed with colour and action.  It is also packed with adult injokes and movie references. I counted more than 20 and the IMDb lists even more than that. And after a film of laughs, jokes, adventure, emotion and fun, the best scene comes at the end as the entire cast rocks out to I'm a Believer. (Maybe Disney needs to get the message that original sappy ballads that are written to win Oscars just aren't needed).If you are one of the few people left on Earth who have not seen Shrek, do so right now! What a treat! A true gift to movie goers and proof that animation is not Disney's monopoly.**** out of ****.",10,0,0,18 November 2001
The Emperor's New Groove," Played Strictly for Laughs, and It Works
","It is a treat to watch a movie that does not take itself at all seriously and works. In The Emperor's New Groove, Disney goes for laughs pretty much on every frame and achieves its goal. This is a fast paced and funny film with a unique animation style and lots and lots of laughs.David Spade pays Kuzco, a bratty spoiled Emperor who thinks he is beloved, but is hated by just about everyone. John Goodman co-stars as Pacha, the lovable peasant who discovers that the Emperor is plotting to destroy his home to build a summer Villa. Kzco is being plotted against by Izma (Eartha Kitt is a bit of genius casting) and her dim-witted sidekick Gronk, whose attempt to poison him turns the Emperor into a Llama.From there, the movie is a buddy adventure as the unlikely pair of Pacha and Kuzco try to find there way back to the palace and restore Kuzco to the throne.The laughs abound. In the movie's best scene, the four leads are all in a restaurant ordering lunch and going unnoticed to eachother. It displays perfect comic timing, and even a very subtle tribute to Five Easy Pieces.
The best thing about this movie is the voice-over work of Patrick Warburton as Gronk. As the loyal and dense side-kick, he plays that standard Disney role of the villain with a conscience, this time, quite literally. Gronk wants to be a servant and a chef, but we also find out he can dance, clean and speak fluent squirrel.This is not Disney's most artistic accomplishment, nor its greatest feat of creativity. But it is a thoroughly entertaining, funny, light-hearted film. ***1/2 out of ****.",8,1,2,6 March 2004
Bull Durham," The movie about the love of Baseball
","Crash Davis loves baseball more than it loves him. He believes in the game. He deserves to be in the show, but he isn't and never will be. But still he plays on, dutifully and to a certain extent, joyfully. Better to play crappy A-ball than sell shoes.That for me is the central theme of this film. It is all summed up when Crash tells Nuke, the wild young star pitcher 'You don't respect yourself. That's your problem. You don't respect the game. That's my problem.'Take a player that passionate, and a youngster that annoying, add in a sexy yet maternal fan and you have great comedy. Bull Durham works scene after scene, because the film never forgets that baseball is what binds all the characters together.Tim Robbins is nothing short of brilliant and Nuke Laloosh, the rising star youngster who walks 18 batters and strikes out 18 batters in his first minor league appearance - both league records. But Nuke is caught up in his fat contract, his Porsche, and his endless parade of women. Baseball is a sideline. Eventually, Crash's mentoring begins to pay off until he finally realizes that winning is 'like, you know, better than losing!'The love triangle between Annie (Susan Sarandon), Crash and Nuke is wonderful and funny, but it mainly provides us with set up for the baseball scenes, like when Sarandon convinces Nuke to wear women's underwear while he pitches. Or my favourite scene, when Annie and Crash take batting practise together, Annie dressed like she is ready for a wedding, but determined to correct Crash's swing. Crash is determined to take Annie home. They flirt and practice batting in one of the best prolonged foreplay scenes ever filmed.The ending is satisfying but the real depth of this film is harmony that the game brings to the characters. **** out of ****.",9,28,38,10 October 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The Best of the Trilogy
","Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King is grand achievement. On its own, it is spectacular swashbuckling fantasy film, scary, intense and infinitely enjoyable. But as the final and best chapter of the Trilogy, it ranks as one of the best and most important films ever made.Picking up exactly at the end of The Two Towers, ROTK follows two stories. Frodo, Sam and Gollum continue on their journey towards Mordor to destroy the One Ring in its fire. We know from the end of the Two Towers that Gollum has plans to kill his two hobbit companions, and vows to let 'her' do it. This leads us to an ingenious scene where Gollum talks to his evil alter-ego, this time by conversing with his reflection in a pool of water. It mimics the similar scene in The Two Towers, but tops if for originality and treachery. At the same time, the rest of the Fellowship re-group after the fall of Isengard, and start to amass troops to defend Minas Tirith from the inevitable attack of the Orc army.The sheer relentless action in this film is beyond description. The battle at Minas Tirith probably lasts an hour and will have you pinned to your seat. There is a sequence when Legolas takes on a giant Mumakil and a dozen or so soldiers riding it. It is one of the great moments of the trilogy, and is perfectly believable - not for a moment do you think that you are viewing a sequence entirely made of special effects.The sequences through the caves with Gollum, growing ever more evil in his pursuit to regain his precious, and the fights with Shelob the giant spider, are nearly too intense to watch. When you pause to think how silly the concept is - a three-foot hobbit battling a massive salivating spider - the success with which this scene comes off is all the more amazing.ROTK completes many of the characters, most notably Gandalf, who proves himself not only wise, but a great general and warrior.As the credits rolled, my first thought was that if a trite piece of fluff like Gladiator can win best picture, ROTK should be a shoe in.
Two Towers was better than Fellowship, and ROTK towers over The Two Towers. The Trilogy combined will take a place in my all time top 10 - I just haven't decided yet which film they will supplant. I cannot think of an American trilogy that is superior, where each chapter improves on the previous and where three are a coherent story. This represents the greatest work of sustained film making in decades and will go down in history as of the cinemas crowing achievements. Kudos to Mr. Jackson, and also to New Line Cinema who put their very existence on the line by greenlighting this project.**** out of ****.",10,0,0,23 December 2003
Tarzan," One of Disney's Best
","The true measure of a family film is to watch a child's reaction. My (normally jumpy) three-year-old sat with enraptured glee through this movie and was able to articulate the plot back to me with amazing detail. That's not a parent's rambling, its a credit to a brilliant movie. Tarzan ranks just below Beauty and the Beast and Little Mermaid in the list of the best of Disney's new films.Disney formula (rogue orphan, evil villain pretending to be a friend, whacky sidekick, neurotic friend and lots a snappy tunes) has never been more apparent, but it works perfectly. But the real joy of this movie is its breathtaking beauty and the message of living without prejudice.Don't expect anything new from Disney, and do not expect a detailed retelling of the original novel. But do expect to see their product refined even further and at its best since Beauty and the Beast. This is a kid's movie, but any grown-up can like it. Minnie Driver and Wayne Knight provide the best voice overs.As my six-year-old daughter told me once, 'I like movies with scary beginnings, silly middles and happy endings.' Needless to say, she loved Tarzan.  **** out of ****.",8,58,72,25 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Best Star Wars and One of the Best Films Ever Made
","It took many years and many viewings before I could say that I liked this film better than A New Hope. But careful examination tells all - by every conceivable measure this is a better picture. The characters are more fully developed, Vader is even more evil, the score gives us the chilling Vader theme and the story is more interesting. Now that the six films are complete, The Empire Strikes Back is even more compelling and interesting than it was before we knew its Big Secret.All great heroes are flawed, and Luke Skywalker is no exception. Empire reveals to us in full that the inner battle he will have to fight is worse than any enemy he will face. As we meet for the first time Yoda, the wise Jedi master (we find out in Sith why he is on this jungle planet), we learn what a Jedi is, what his responsibility is and just how difficult that life will be. Luke, however, wants immediate gratification - he wants to help and wants revenge.The film cuts back and forth between Han Solo and Leia's pursuit by Vader and Luke's training and ultimately leads to the greatest scene of the six films, the epic light saber battle between Luke and Vader. And, if you are one of the 12 people on the planet who do not know the outcome, the less said the better.Empire rightly holds a place in the IMDb top 10, combining Action-Adventure, space opera and even the best elements of a super-hero film, into an infinitely watchable, entertaining movie. **** out of ****.",10,3,5,14 April 2006
Goodfellas," The Best Film of the 90's
","Well, it's between Goodfellas, Schindler's List and Fargo for the best of the 90's, but IMHO, this is it. This movie stays with you and effects you in ways that few if any films do. Every scene is perfect, every shot works - it is brilliantly written and is another master work of editing by Thelma Schoonmaker. Its loss of the Best Picture Oscar to Dances with Wolves (of all movies) is the 2nd greatest scandal in Oscar History (next to the shutout of The Color Purple).It is its attention to detail and Scorsese's ability to pick the exact, singularly perfect song for each shot that makes this film so great. Take the scene for example, of Robert DeNiro, sitting at the bar, silent, smoking a cigarette, essentially contemplating who to kill. As the shot slowly zooms in on him, I defy anyone to find better music than 'Sunshine of Your Love' to complete that gripping scene. Or even more so, the playing of Sid Vicious' slaughtering of 'My Way' over the closing credits.Pesci, Liotta, Deniro, Bracco and Sorvino (in the best role of his career) are stunning, but this is Martin Scorsese's triumph. He will be viewed upon one day (likely after his death) as the greatest ever American Director. He has four absolute masterpieces to his name, and not a single bad film. This, however, is the apex of his career.Goodfellas is not about anything other than life in a crew - being on the inside. The guilt, the pride, the easy life, the paranoia, the forced laughter, the constant fear and the struggle to lie correctly when asked a tough question. In the famous scene with Paulie (Sorvino) asking Henry (Liotta) about the killing of a made guy from another crew, I have always believed that Paulie knows the truth and wants Henry to lie, but has to ask the question because it is expected of him. Not a direct question, just 'Whaddya know about that thing?'.Goodfellas is a gift to moviegoers - one that should be enjoyed over and over again. It is violent and it does have more f-shots than any movie I can recall. It is edgy and uneasy and it will get right under your skin and make it crawl. But it is also infectious and addictive at the same time. The Canadian Cable Channel Bravo often plays this uncut and commercial free late at night and I find myself awake at 4 am watching it, even though I own the video.The closing scene of this movie is probably the greatest sustained piece of filmmaking I have ever scene - Henry must sell some guns, close a drug deal, cook some pasta sauce, juggle his wife and girlfriend and outrun some pesky helicopters all in a fit of increasing paranoia. As the world closes in on Henry, it closes in on you and you want to squirm out. You know why Henry made his final decision.Absolutely perfect. **** out of ****.",Null,0,0,2 July 1999
All the President's Men," Intense, Compelling & Entertaining
","You know you have a good movie when scenes of a man on the phone taking notes are amongst the best. Some of the best footage in this picture is Robert Redford making call after call, fiercely scribbling, scarcely believing his own ears.All The President's Men is a truly great film from many standpoints - film making, historical overview, social importance. It works from all angles and is entertaining above all.The subject matter is handled perfectly. Rather than make a movie about Watergate (which we all know), they writers wisely made a movie about the investigating of Watergate. We know the outcome, we know many of the key facts. That is why we can get even more enraged when Woodward and Burnstein are lied to and mislead. The social importance of this movie cannot be overstated either. Watching ATPM now seems almost like a documentary. We must keep in mind that this was made while Watergate was still fresh in the country's mind and that the divisive, partisan wounds were still healing. A gutsy move, but a successful one.All elements of this film strike the perfect tone continually. It is presented in such a way as to throw information at you from all angles, confusing and jumbled, with lies and half-truths woven in everywhere. This is done to give the viewer the same paranoid sense of futility that the reporters on this case truly must have had.Also of note is the fact that this film is very neutral. It does not Republican bash any more than it has to. That is key to its success.A nearly perfect film. **** out of ****.",10,2,2,9 December 2004
The Godfather," A Landmark Picture
","(WARNING: Plot Spoilers)
If you have not seen the Godfather, do yourself a favour - skip my comments, and rent it today! I have seen this movie too many times to comment without giving away key elements.This movie is a cinematic landmark - one of the great achievements of the 20th century. From its quiet opening in Vito Corleone's office, with the the blubbering appeal of Amerigo Bonasera ('Make them suffer as I have suffered') to the closing of that same office door at the end, when Kaye comes to grips with the man she married, every frame of this film is filled with intrigue, images and treachery.You cannot view this film and judge its morality - it has none. It told entirely on its own terms. All the main characters are career criminals and the only law enforcement office in the movie is a corrupt cop protecting a drug dealer. To watch the movie, you have to accept its terms. If you do, you will be in for an experience of a lifetime.The wedding scene at the beginning is brilliant. Slowly but surely, all the characters are introduced, while at the same time, we get bits of information on their personalities and foreshadowing of future events. Note some of the payoffs that this scene sets up. That Paulie Gatto is a traitor ('If this was someone else's wedding). That Bonasera the undertaker will owe the Don a service, to hide his son's massacre from his wife. That the plea of Johnny Fontaine for a movie role will result in him reluctantly agreeing to perform at a casino for the family. And of course, there is the introduction of the fearsome Luca Brasi.Marlon Brando makes this movie great. Don Corleone is arguably the most famous and most imitated character in movie history. The accent, the hand gestures, the sly smile he give Solozzo are  all a credit to an acting genius.The score by Fellini composer Nino Rota is one of the creepiest and most famous in film history. It complements the film rather than overpowers it, and gives the Godfather its unique quality. Gordon Willis' cinematography can only be described as perfect.The movie ends with the famous 'baptism scene' in which Michael renounces Satan while executing all of his enemies - the baptism is the perfect alibi. In this scene, we learn how Michael views himself - a man in perfect control over his own world, above the law of both man and God. Truly fascinating.The Godfather also contains my single favourite line in movie history, spoken by Clemenza after the murder of Paulie Gatto: 'Leave the gun. Take the canoli.'I like Part II even more, because the plot is more involving and the flashback scenes to the rise of Vito Corleone are the best cinematic work ever (imho). Needless to say, these movies are numbers 1 & 2 on my all-time list.For me, this is a perfect motion picture. **** out of ****.",10,2,5,27 August 1999
