Frost_Nixon," Previewed 19/01/09 (TelTen)
","Excellent production. Excellent performances by two of the world's best character actors.I must first admit, I didn't really know too much about the Watergate affair, but, I did read up before I went to see this and it helped. Of course, this film isn't about Watergate, It's about the struggle of Frost and the guilt ridden audacity of Nixon. I'd often heard and once saw part of the interviews but, I didn't realise the background before I saw this film.I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes a realistic approach to film making, story telling and appreciates great acting. Well done everyone involved. I'm looking forward to 'Angels & Demons'",10,4,8,20 January 2009
