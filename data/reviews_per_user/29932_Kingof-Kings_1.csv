The Hangover," Good But not great; worth Watching.
","The Hangover follows three amnesiac groomsman the day after a bachelor party as they track down the origins of a series of clues that they hope lead them to the lost groom, Doug (Justin Bartha). The main attraction for this movie was Mike Tyson's cameo role and i didn't expect much from this movie; Zach Galifianakis character (Alan Garner) was the best part of the film for me. overall i feel this is a furiously paced and inventive take on a tried-and-tested formula. An exemplary bromantic comedy that doesn't sacrifice heart in pursuit of laughs. This movie is not an all time great comedy, However if you have spare time you should check it out.",7,0,3,2 June 2010
