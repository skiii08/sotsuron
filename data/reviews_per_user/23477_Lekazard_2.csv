Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Eric Forrester knows kung fu in a spaghetti western set
","I'm one of those persons who watched vol 1 with my jaw wide open. The killing spree in the end of the movie was something which I never had seen before. Even though people get sliced, cut and decapitated the katana massacre was't exaggerated nor gross.I believe I represent a typical QT fan and from this point of view KB2 was a disappointment. Not a big one but still. First of all the flick is way too long. There are couple of scenes which have very little/none to do with the plot and they are somewhat loose from the rest of the movie. If QT hadn't cut the story in half, these scenes probably would have not been included.Secondly the dialogue is surprisingly dull. This issue was also somewhat included in vol 1 but it wasn't that noteworthy 'cause the movie had lots of action and little speech. This movie is the opposite. It wouldn't bother me if the dialogue was good but this time it's incredibly far from the level which we have been used to in QT movies. Mostly it's just merely meaningless chit chat.But the movie isn't actually that bad. The cast is good and acting is quite excellent. David Carradine steals every scene he appears in. Daryl Hannah is also good (losing the only working eye and getting blinded in a trailer in the middle of a desert, that's just sad. That poor bitch).If KB1 was Pulp Fiction then KB2 is more like Jackie Brown. In my opinion, the films would've worked better if they were both in one properly cut.",8,0,1,24 April 2004
Pi," One of the worst movies ever...
","The first thing I noticed, was that the movie was monochrome. A movie being black and white has never been a reason for me no to watch a movie, so I was thinking, I can deal with that.The second note I made was that the movie is a bit weird. Suddenly I'm beginning to think I'm watching a David Lynch film. And I don't see that as a good thing.I've always tried my best to watch every movie from the beginning to the end, but while watching 'Pi' I couldn't finish watching it. I don't find interesting to watch a movie without a plot nor any destination. The main character is so hollow, that it's impossible to learn to understand him, not to mention to get attached to him.I can't see how anyone can find a movie with no plot interesting...",2,8,15,20 January 2004
