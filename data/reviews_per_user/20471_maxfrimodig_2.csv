The Equalizer," I remember a similar movie with same actor
","Here we see him Denzel again, is it good of course it is its great i think. Would i see it again? yes i will.The plot is good, he does read books he is smart, and there is a young prostitute that he helps. This is a movie where you know you are going to like. He is a hard man with a nice attitude a education in hurting and using it do give justice.Could you ever think that this movie would be another i want to be that guy movie. He keep his house clean he got the cash and he is ready to do business.First fighting scene is great, its just there you know this movie i will see again no question about it.",9,0,5,13 February 2015
Draft Day," Is this good or is it
","You got a great movie not so much foul language its nothing to see with your young kids but from 15 years i think is OK but thats up to you.What can i say i get to see a good plot with good acting there is nothing to it a perfect Friday night watching movie. After this movie the weekend will feel better and maybe you go out play some ball too get inspired. Its a really really feel good mature movie with all elements a sport movie should have.And who do we see in this movie too among the stars P Diddy making a really good acting too. Jennifer garner makes a heck out of her part, but the absolute best in my opinion is Kevin Costner.I don't want to spoil anything about this movie in case you haven't seen it yet. I can only say go rent it have a good time and enjoy this film because its worth your time.",9,0,1,13 February 2015
