The Legend of Bagger Vance," When was the moment I quit caring? zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
","I can't remember the exact moment when I quit caring about this movie, these characters and the game of golf.  I just remember yawning and looking at my watch as my mind begin to wander, no longer was I 'in the moment'.The story and characters felt a bit underdeveloped and it was difficult to invest in any of it.  It's too bad, because I think Matt Damon is a very talented actor. Charlize Theron was alright, but not amazing.  She didn't have much to work with either.  The writing felt empty and predictable.  There was barely any obstacles to overcome, no surprises.   Every  time Matt Damon would 'lose his swing', Will Smith would give him some speech about golf and life and that would work for a little while.  Then Damon would lose it again, and Will Smith would spout out another monologue. Oh wise one.I'm sorry. It's golf.  zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzC+",Null,2,3,9 November 2000
Catch Me If You Can," Am I The Only One Who Read The Book First?
","Frank Abnigale Jr. appeared on the TV show PEOPLE ARE TALKING in the early 90's I believe. My mother and I were in awe of this man's true story and bought and read his book.  I kept waiting for a movie to be made, but it never happened.....until now.This is a GOOD MOVIE, but 2 hours is just not long enough to tell all the juicy details of this man's story.  This movie is entertaining, but lacks the depth of the whole story. But heck, it's just a movie.I, for one, wouldn't have minded seeing this movie play longer, but I am sure the studios didn't want to release a 3 hour movie.  A two part mini-series might still give the story justice.  Frank Abnigale Jr. did so much more than what was put into this movie. It was still fun though.Left out, were quite a bit of the details about how he LEARNED fraudulent technique.  I wonder if Spielberg thought the audience would be bored by such detail, but in fact, I would have been riveted. The movie feels like it's in a hurry (hardy har har) and is afraid of boring its audience.Too fluffy for oscar buzz with the exception of Christopher Walken.  Hey - maybe they will turn it into a series on cable.....8/10T",8,1,1,26 December 2002
Erin Brockovich," JULIA ROBERTS SHINES IN HER STRENGTHS AS ERIN BROCKOVICH
","Hallelujah for Julia Roberts. She was BORN to play this role! Erin Brockovich is one of the most entertaining movies I have seen in a long time! And I am VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT!The element that made Julia Roberts a star in Pretty Woman is very much what carried this movie.  Julia's strengths is her ability to play street-wise, honest, and passionate characters.  Erin Brockovich is all those things.The writing is dead on, making Roberts job easier, I am sure. And Roberts delivery of the lines was flawless. SHE WAS ERIN BROCKOVICH. Not that I have ever met the woman...Only in some places did the movie feel a little slow, I think perhaps, because of what the movie was about.  Contamination cases aren't exactly the most exciting of plots, but it doesn't stay in one place too long and keeps moving.I would pay full price to see this movie again. There is just so much funny dialogue in it.9 out of 10 I vote.",9,59,88,2 April 2000
Unbreakable," Good Idea, a bit schmaltzy at times...
","I liked the idea of this movie, but there were too many technical glitches that distracted me.I thought Bruce Willis was fine, playing it cool as usual. I thought Samuel L. Jackson was a bit over the top.  Now, I am sure Samuel L. Jackson is a fine actor and I can't help but wonder if the DIRECTION is what threw him off.  I don't quite understand the intense choices he was making.  It started to feel silly after awhile.  Although parts of the movie were based on comic books, the movie itself wasn't a comic book. But some of the direction felt like they wanted to turn the movie into a comic book.  I laughed, but not for the right reasons.There were a few forced and contrived moments in this film, largely due to the manipulative soundtrack. 'This is the part where the audience is supposed to FEEL something.'  I felt left out of whatever was going on.  I chuckled after awhile.Some of the dialogue begin to grow thin as I fidgeted in my seat.  I predicted about three incidents that took place.  The idea was such a good one, but the details were less than amazing.  It's the details that makes a great film, not a pitch.I thought the ending was very smart and clever, but I thought HOW IT WAS DIRECTED was a bit schmaltzy. Good idea, cheesy direction.I know this was written by the sixth sense guy, but I didn't compare the two.  The style was similar, but the story was very different.oh well.",Null,1,1,23 November 2000
Ocean's Twelve," WHAT WAS THAT?
","**spoilers**Okay- throw me a bone here. I know I am not a sleuth or anything, but the average movie goer needs some help filling in the blanks from time to time.I think Soderbergh was just a little too close to his own project.The first act took waaaay too long. The pace was just off. I needed to see the main characters jumping ship from their current living situations within the first 10 minutes. I don't think I needed to see Benedict visiting every thief in the beginning. We already know they are caught. The beginning could have been more creative.The story took too long to introduce the night fox. Pacing off. But what really killed me was the reuniting of Zeta Jones and her father. PUKE. Why did he have to pretend to be dead? That was a bit much.Someone explain to me again what happened with Damon's MOM? I missed the 'clue' beforehand.Brad Pitt...just not doing it for me. For whatever reason, I just don't believe him.Sorry.",6,1,2,18 December 2004
Elf," 'Big' meets 'The Jerk' - Corny, but funny for the kiddies
","I saw this movie at a matinee and that's about right.Will Ferrell is great with physical comedy and this movie is well cast. Some things are predictable if you have seen movies like 'Big' and 'The Jerk'.But the details is what makes this movie stand out and I will not spoil them for you.  I loved some of the over-the-top ridiculous make believe dramatics that took place, especially in the 'north pole'.This is definitely for the kiddies and those with imagination- who really really 'want to believe.'7/10",7,3,5,24 November 2003
Bridget Jones's Diary," Not what I thought it was gonna be about, but still funny...
","I think my single sister and I both thought this movie was gonna be about a woman and her independence.  Instead, it's just another romantic comedy.Don't get me wrong, it's hilarious for the most part, I just didn't think it would have so many romantic links in it.The previews made Bridget look like she was 'through' with men and was proud to be single.  But she was never through with men.  She just was just tired of meeting bad ones.  And she hardly ever writes in her diary. WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?But Renee Zellewegger (or however you spell her name) once again, proves that she is a FUNNY ACTRESS.  I thought she was great in Nurse Betty and she is even funnier in this movie.I just wish the ending would have been a little more original. But overall, this is a very entertaining movie.8/10",8,0,0,14 April 2001
The Italian Job," Entertaining, funny and refreshing.....
","Especially after watching THE MATRIX RELOADED!! *SPOILERS*After seeing the Matrix with all it's ridiculous fantasy make-believe-robotic characters with their super powers, it was refreshing to see an action movie with real people in situations that involved actual risk!  I cared about these people, and even though some of the stunts seemed a bit much, it still left me feeling like 'it's possible'  verses 'what a stupid video game' (like the Matrix)This movie isn't brain surgery, it's very straight forward.  Some things are predictable- like knowing that someone is going to be a back-stabber and that someone early on is going to die.  Pretty obvious, but SO WHAT?  The first 15 minutes sets up our reason, our motive, our main objective.I like that Theron and Walhberg didn't have any make-out scenes. I am glad that they didn't go there.  They kept it about funny dialogue ESPECIALLY SETH GREENE. That guy IS FUNNY!This is a movie that I would buy when it comes out on DVD.  It's fun, fast and entertaining. The only thing (and I guess it's a big thing) is that we are really - rooting for the bad guys.  This group of protaganists are already on the wrong side of the law.  Not a good message for the kiddies - parents, please explain this to them.",8,0,0,7 June 2003
Ocean's Eleven," Letter To Steven Soderbergh
","Dear Steven,Please quit putting Julia Roberts in all your movies. She's not THAT great. I realize she is the most famous movie star in the world and the studios love her bankability.....but. You know better. Come on......she was not right for the Oceans 11 role.  It should have been a woman with more grace, say...Catherine Zeta Jones.  Julia is a little too rough around the edges. She plays a hooker well and a single mom of three....a street walking cinderella, if you will.I love George Clooney. You have my permission to use him in every movie you do for the rest of your life. Okay. Maybe only roles he is best suited for. So far so good. You also could have cast Tom Cruise in that role. That would have been pretty good. He's smart, sexy and very likeable.Brad Pitt....egh. Not bad, not great either. Matt Damon....ROCKS. Andy Garcia....ROCKS. The Guy who played the card dealer rocked. Cheadle....what was up with the unnecessary accent? Affleck & the other young guy: HILARIOUS. Sometimes less is more. Good job with them. Elliott Gould: I love this guy! Carl Reiner: How cute.This movie was cute. Entertaining, predictable and cute. Now, if you excuse me, I have an itch to scratch...it's called OUT OF SIGHT.7/10",7,0,1,8 December 2001
School of Rock," Gives Young People Credit.....
","I knew I would love this movie because I love Jack Black and I love music. What I didn't know is that I would love this movie because it showcases that young kids ARE SMART - much more than we give them credit for.At an age where one assumes that a child cannot handle certain responsibilities or isn't ready for 'the real world' - this movie challenges that aspect.Granted, it is a MOVIE hence, some FANTASY - but I was inspired at how Jack Black's character, for the most part, doesn't 'talk down' to these young talented kids.  He treats them as if 'of COURSE they can handle things and BE IN CHARGE of certain activities' -even at the age of 10 and this pleases me.This movie will be much funnier to you if you like rock music and are familiar with the AC/DC references.  I loved it.8/10",8,0,0,11 October 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," If you like VIDEO GAMES.....
","..you'll LOVE -THE MATRIX RELOADED!!  Wait, but I don't love videogames. *SPOILAGE* I would like to spill spoilage....Anyhoo....let's see....about 15 minutes into this film I thought i waswatching the world's longest video game.  I know I should appreciatespecial affects and stunts more....but what can I say....I like a decentstory.Yes, it's very entertaining, I give it that.  I just don't know,overall, if I cared about any of these characters.  It seemed so overthe top in that every other line they were saying was always alludingto....'the worst' or 'matter of life or death'  .....ALL THE TIME!!Okay, I get it....your town is gonna be destroyed. It's a war. That'sfine.  Oh, I wonder who will win?  These characters seem to have little to no vulnerability cuz of thewhole robot thing.  Except for that cute keymaker! HE WAS MY FAVORITECHARACTER! Probably, cuz I could actually see his heart.I am just not into this kind of flick I guess.  When one or twocharacters play a terminator type character, that's one thing....BUTWHEN 90 percent of the characters are droning on in that tough-monotonous tone - SAVE THE WORLD...SAVE THE WORLD...BOMB ZION ALREADY!! I don't even care anymore.Oh yeah- when Neo fixed Trinity's heart....that just clinched it for me.ARE THESE CHARACTERS REALLY IN DANGER? I don't think so. They will allsurvive, because Hollywood loves movies that continue to make money. They wouldn't dare kill the protaganist",7,0,0,27 May 2003
A Beautiful Mind," Russell Crowe Rocks...
","*I may have a spoiler in here*I am a struggling actress who has been blown away by Crowe.  This man is so freaking good it makes me feel bad about myself!! I feel like such an under-achiever!! How does one get to be so talented???This movie, director, and Crowe will all get nominated for oscars. I guarantee it.  Jennifer Connelly may get nominated as well.And I have a new crush on that guy who ends up losing the Wheeler scholarship too. I think his real name is Joshua Lucas. What a cutie.Oh, I mean...what a deep movie...yeah yeah...and all that jazz..9/10  only cuz it gets a bit schmaltzy at times.",9,0,1,4 January 2002
Blow," Since I am not up to speed on my drug movies....
","I really liked it.  I am not jaded by earlier drug films.  This one does me just fine.  I normally don't go out and see these kind of films, so this stuff is not every day information for me.  This movie works because the emotions the main character goes through are universal feelings.  I have never been involved in drugs, but I have been down and out and depressed and dissatisfied.  Johnny Depp does a great job and has come along way from 21 Jump Street. He has made smart career choices, doing what he can to stay away from the bubblegum typecasting and doing what he can to be taken seriously as an actor. Kudos for him.I cried at the end.  We all want to be loved, through it all, don't we?T",8,0,0,7 April 2001
Vanilla Sky," Entertaining and Annoying
","SPOILER ALERT What can I say? Another obscure a la THE GAME meets THE MATRIX (not that the matrix was obscure).  I would like to say this movie was 'riveting' but I am so sick of this whole...is it a dream inside a dream inside a dream inside a dream nonsense.  Okay, we get it. Is it real or not real or blah blah and do we care anymore?My problem with movies like this, is that it's the easy way out of good writing with a compelling message.  Ambiguity for ambiguity's sake.  Don't give me the high browe elitist artsy fartsy argument.  Don't insult me. You want to impress me? HAVE A CLEAR MESSAGE.  You can leave me hanging, but WRAP IT UP. DRAW A CONCLUSION.Don't give me that 'let the audience draw their own conclusions' crap. That reminds me of a particular student in my film class.  Most people thought he was being obscure and groundbreaking. I just thought he was GETTING OUT OF THE ASSIGNMENT.  Didn't want to take the time to present a clear theme to his audience.  Much like this movie.You can say 'I didn't get it' all you want.  As a writer, I would like to think my thoughts are communicated clearly.  That I got a person to think and become more aware.  Movies like Vanilla Sky are more about the ride and I understand that.  But this ride needed a more satisfying ending.P.S. I don't believe in all that 'your next life' crap either.  Although I was down with the 'dream' vibe. Too bad it got murky.",7,0,1,29 December 2001
Signs," LOVED IT!
","FINALLY, a movie I can say that I loved! (this may have SPOILERS)After being disappointed in the third installment of Austin Powers, I needed to restore my faith (no pun intended) in movies and alas....SIGNS! GOD BLESS IT!Although not a perfect film, (I had a little problem with how funny the aliens looked) Signs was utterly enjoyable.The cast was awesome, especially the children and the pace was a much improvement from the director's 'Unbreakable', which felt slow and monotonous.SIGNS works because the story continues to move forward while inserting humor in almost every scene. How a thriller about aliens and the possible end times can handle humor so nicely is amazing to me.  It's a tricky balance and this talented director/writer pulls it off.This movie gets its audience TO THINK.  I hope people won't shrug it off as being a movie that promotes any particular faith. The catholic wardrobe, I believe, is for visual effect.  The man of faith played by Mel Gibson, could have been ANY FAITH. It was SYMBOLIC. He was ALSO A MARRIED PRIEST-so get the hint. This is not a movie about catholicism. No mention of God is even presented. The audience must fill in the blanks. THEY ONLY MENTION HOPE AND FAITH AND PRAYER. I am a Christian, and I can appreciate the writer's ability to want to have faith in something or someone bigger than himself. We could all use a little faith. Ya gotta start somewhere!Two thumbs up! 8/10",8,0,1,11 August 2002
Rock Star," This movie is not about music, but I think that is the point
","Fluffy fun. Not a lot of depth here. I did long for more detailed characters, but it was still a fun ride.Being in high school in the 80's helped me to really appreciate this movie. There were so many teenagers in the theatre that missed so many of the jokes. People kept staring at me because I was laughing so much.I really liked the ending. I have never thought about how much it made sense to have the over-indulgent 80's give way to the purist early 90's scene. And Mark Wahlberg looks so much better with short hair. :)The credits were hilarious. Especially when that one early 90's song came on that I won't tell you what it was. It was my favorite joke.This movie wasn't about music unfortunately, and that is what I miss. But I think the point was that so much of that 80's glam scene was about something else other than music...7/10",7,0,1,7 September 2001
High Fidelity," CO-STARS Outshine Cusack in this self absorbed comedy
","The co-stars (too many too list) who play in this romantic-comedy-I-guess, are far more interesting than our central character played by Cusack. Cusack plays a record store owner who spends the whole movie whining about his failed love life.  For the first 40 minutes of it, I hung in there, waiting for our main character to show SOME character.  After that, I begin to look at my watch.The problem with High Fidelity, is that our main character is too much of jerk to like.  He is totally selfish and immature for his age and his habits are a complete afront to women.  I was okay with that, at first. But a shallow main character can't carry a picture all the way through without showing SOME promise along the way. This is supposed to be OUR guy. We are supposed to be rooting for him the whole way through. But after awhile, I just wished that one of his many ex-girlfriends would have shot him in the head and put us all out of our misery.  John Cusack's character has no perspective or enough depth to carry a movie. John, GET A REAL PROBLEM.I was insulted, because Cusack was potraying someone my age and it just makes our generation look useless.  Cusack finally does get his act together at the VERY END of the movie. Not soon enough. And I never really believed he was a lover of music.  He didn't have the passion for it the way his employees at the record store did. They were believable.  Cusack could have been a shoe salesman for all we know. He says a few snappy lines about music trivia and owns a lot of vinyl, but he just doesn't 'fit' the part.  He would have been more believable if he cut his hair, put on a suit and played a RECORD LABEL EXECUTIVE.THANK GOD for his co-stars. They were excellently cast and offered plenty of comic relief to break up the monotony of Cusack's pathetic love life and his journey to 'find himself'. If they had let this movie play dark all the way through and then killed Cusack at the end, I would have liked it better. But the Hollywood ending was so cliche I wanted to VOMIT PROFUSELY. They spend the whole movie trying to sound 'INDIE' and they have that cheesy ending...LOTS OF SHALLOW LAUGHS, BUT IGNORE CUSACK.",6,0,1,2 April 2000
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Well, that was cute...
","Cute. Pretty Cute.  I like them character actors I do.I like this over the top stuff.George Clooney really held this picture together.  At times in the middle of this picture, it started to slow down and all of the characters started to run together. What makes a character actor interesting is when he/she is playing opposite some straight characters as well.  There were so many character actor roles in this, that at times it got a bit tiring to watch. Kinda like The Grinch Whole Stole Christmas, but nowhere as bad.The movie picks itself back up from Clooney's bootstraps and he and Holly Hunter (who had a way too small role in this) show us how these types of roles are done.  Not overdone.  Just done.7/10",7,0,0,18 February 2001
