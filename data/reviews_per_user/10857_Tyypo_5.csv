E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Overrated
","I grew up in the 70s and 80s. I never watched this film, just because from what I could see I thought it would be sappy and stupid. I had the opportunity recently, and watched it with my wife at her suggestion. I have softened over the years.It was absolutely everything I had feared it would be. Dumb, sappy, incongruous, and inconsistent. Would someone please explain to the the rationale behind the bizarre physical and psychic link between E.T. and Elliot? And why Elliot wasn't taken to ER after his odd behavior in class? This is a terribly overrated film; I generously give it 5/10.",5,0,8,8 December 2019
The Illusionist," Not the worst 'magic' film I've seen...
","But clearly one of the most disappointing and overrated. 7.7 at IMDb? Wow, I had a very much different experience from the majority of folks here. I concede that the scenery was great, but there were a number of factors that completely ruined the film for me. Here a just a few:First, was the end supposed to be a surprise? My gosh, it was telegraphed before the 'murder' ever happened. At the Big Reveal, it played like an M. Night Shyamalan wannabe flick, except way more obvious. I can't believe that many people 'fell for it.' I genuinely thought (or hoped) that the climax was going to *not* be that.Second, the illusions performed by Eisenheim were simply unbelievable. The fact that it was clearly CGI and not even remotely genuine illusion distracted from the authenticity of the story. If we could expect him to really do these things through trickery or actual supernatural power, then he is capable of way more than the movie delivered. He could have spirited away with Sophie in a much less contrived fashion.Third, Giamatti as the Inspector seems absolutely amused to realize that he's been a pawn manipulated to investigate a murder that never even happened, a scheme that nearly resulted in his own demise. Oh, those crazy lovers!",1,28,48,5 February 2010
The Evil Dead," A movie with more notoriety than it deserves
","First off, I liked 'Army of Darkness', essentially the film that put the Evil Dead movies on the map. I knew of the two prequels, but they were really hard to find for a while. I'm not really a fan of gore per se, so the reviews that described it as such deterred me for a while. However, I couldn't resist streaming Netflix + some spare time.I know people in these sort of movies are compelled to do stupid things, but this one goes over the top. The most cowardly woman of the group going out alone to look for someone/something was completely out of character. The subsequent violation by demonic foliage was out of place, uncalled for, and unnecessarily gratuitous. Then there's the whole notion that evil supernatural forces are trying to kill them, so... let's split the injured girl away from the rest so she can take a nap. That's a sound strategy.There are people who are scared by this film, even think it is the scariest they've seen? You probably shouldn't have gone to my high school; you'd just be cowering in a corner somewhere. The gore effects were about as ridiculous as one could imagine. The stop-motion at the end had me laughing like I was watching an episode of MST3K. For comparison, it made a Doctor Who episode of the same era look like 'Avatar'. I can imagine this being a cult movie with its camp appeal, but scary? Really? This is one overrated movie. When ED2 comes available on streaming Netflix or On Demand, I'll probably watch it for completion, certainly with low expectations.",1,43,77,21 December 2012
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Argh.
","This was a very frustrating movie. I had been looking forward to it, although was initially skeptical after hearing of Ben Affleck as Batman. Seeing the critics views at RottenTomatoes was very discouraging, but for some reason, IMDb showed favorable reviews by audiences. This gave me some hope.That hope was in vain. This movie was all over the place. I'm quite familiar with the DC Universe, having been an on/off comics collector since the 70's. Even so, I found myself unable to keep up with the visions, dream sequences, time-travel visits(?), and just overall plot convolutions in this movie. Some IMDb reviewers have already done an excellent job highlighting the film's foibles, and I doubt I could do better. However, I gotta say something.The casting of Jessie Eisenberg as Lex Luthor was horrible, to the extent that Affleck as Batman warmed my heart in comparison (and I didn't much care for that). Luthor as crazy, essentially a retread of what we've seen as Heath Ledger as Joker, would have alone ruined the movie if that were the only bad thing about it. LL is a brilliant, evil, power hungry genius, not... whatever he was supposed to be here.I cannot get into Batman's motivation. He's a ruthless violent vigilante who's above the law, and he despises Superman for being... above the law. I get the initial distrust thing, but I didn't buy into the whole picture of just wanting to be judge, jury, and executioner without even interacting with Supes first. Not cool, Bats.Lex lets himself into the Kryptonian vessel, with the shaved fingertips of Zod? Kryptonian tech has *terrible* security; maybe they should give Apple a call - no, wait; the FBI hacked that. And then the computer recognizes the carcass of Zod, and doesn't go, 'Hey, who are you? I thought *you* were Zod!' - and then kill him.I know I was supposed to laugh or cheer when Batman tells Ma Kent, 'I'm a friend of your son's,' but for me it was flat. 10 minutes ago, he wanted to kill him.On the way home, my wife and I were discussing the movie, with these observations and more. She asked me, 'Was there anything about the movie you liked?' I thought real hard, and said, 'um... no. Sorry to have suggested it and make you watch it.' And thus justifies my 1-Star review. I guess I kind of liked how Superman comported himself with dignity, and was reasonably well-acted by Cavill. But not enough to change my score.Hey, wasn't there also something about Wonder Woman in the movie? That quickly faded from memory.",1,285,507,16 April 2016
The Pursuit of Happyness," Not sure what to think
","I'm trying very hard to like this movie, but just can't get myself to do it. If it's supposed to be an inspirational feel-good movie, I think it fails big time. For one, it's complete torture to watch until the inevitable concluding events. Then it's just over, roll credits.While Smith's characterization of the protagonist is charismatic, he is at times a considerable jerk and consistently makes poor choices for himself and his family. He takes custody of his boy, when he clearly is not the ideal choice. There is no excuse for forcing him to stay in shelters or a bathroom when the child could be living in a real home with his mother. He blows off people to whom he owes money, but is furious with his friend about the $14 that is owed him.The message cannot be 'work hard and you can achieve your dreams,' because none of the other hard-working interns were hired. And has been asked before, can happiness (or happy-ness as it were) be only achieved when one makes a great deal of money?",3,9,15,7 December 2014
