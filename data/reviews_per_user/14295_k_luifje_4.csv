Casablanca," PERFECT!!!!!!!!!!
","Casablanca may well be the best movie ever to be made in the whole world! The acting, the directing, the light, the script, the clothes and especially the quotes are simply perfect! You have to see this movie, this is one of those movie you may not mis, whatever your favorit genre is! I don't their are movies with more brilliant quotes dan Casablanca, with one of the best actors ever to appear on the silver screen, Humprey Bogart.",10,0,1,17 June 2001
Batman Returns," Batman part 2 beats Batman part 1
","Batman (1989, directed by Tim Burton) was certainly not a bad movie, especially because Jack Nicholson played his Joker-role with 110% enthusiasm, but Batman Returns (1992, also directed by Tim Burton) is even better. Bad guy Danny De Vito (playing The Penguin) plays great and bad girl Michelle Pfeiffer (as The Catwoman) is the best and most sensual Catwoman ever! Pfeiffer in her Catwomansuit is simply delicious to watch!! She also acts out the cat-habits like licking herself very good. And then there is Micheal Keaton as Batman. He was good in the first film and there didn't change anything, he's still a great Bruce Wayne/ Batman.Another improvement to the first Batman film is the story. In the first movie the main woman (played by Kim Basinger) is in the film, but what she's doing there? I don't know. In Batman Returns The Catwoman has a very important role which pushes the story along.The conclusion is that Batman 2 is better than Batman 1 and that there is nothing bad to say about the film.",9,1,2,13 January 2001
Jaws," Jaws rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","Jaws is simply a perfect movie. The first megahit for Steven Spielberg and a deserved one, because the film is at all points great! The music from John Williams is one of the best a movie has ever had. The main players (Richard Dreyfuss, Roy Scheider and Robert Shaw) are outstandingly good, so are the others by the way and the line 'you gonna need a bigger boat'' is so true and also one you won't forget.Jaws looks very good, if you see him, 'cause you don't get to see him that often. The shots at the water are also of a high quality. They are very threatening. This is a movie you have to see at least once in your lifetime.(Even the second time you are chained to your seet). Something you would almost forget: not all the sharks kill people'. There are far more sharks killed by people than there are people killed by a shark!!!",10,4,6,22 October 2000
Tombstone," too much is never good
","Tombstone		 Title: Too much is never goodThis 130-minutes during film doesn't give you a very good feeling. Sure, the actors are all playing their parts well (not good, just well) and Val Kilmer is really terrific as the tuberculosis patient Doc Holliday (it is one of the best roles Kilmer has ever done) and the scenery is very well done, but there is something not all right with the movie. The problem is that there are simply to many characters in this work. Besides the three Earp brothers Wyatt, Virgil and Morgan there are the three wives of the brothers, Doc Holliday and his Hungarian Kate, the tempting Josephine and her colleague Mr. Fabian, Billy Breckenridge, a good role from Jason Priestley, and a hole bunch of bad guys. It just isn't possible to put all of these persons lives and problems in 130 minutes of film. The headaches that Wyatt Earp's wife has, for instance, don't get enough attention to get involved in her situation. The same goes for the whole Morgan Earp-character, played unenthusiastic by Bill Paxton. He hasn't got enough screentime to get you interested in why he does what he does. He seems to be in this movie for the reason that it's impossible to make a movie about the legendary Wyatt Earp without mentioning his two brothers Virgil and Morgan.The second thing not making the movie a very good one is that you don't know who the main character is: Wyatt Earp or Doc Holliday. In the beginning it's obvious that Kurt Russell's Wyatt Earp is the most important person in the film, but slow but sure the Doc Holliday-part gets bigger and so much more interesting than Earp. This is because Val Kilmer is playing Doc Holliday with his whole heart and because you feel more for Holliday that for Earp. Wyatt Earp (in this motion picture) is a man who just wants to get a lot of money with doing as little as possible and Doc Holliday is the kind of person who wants to be there for Earp whenever he needs him, ill or not, Earp can always count on Doc Holliday. Writer Kevin Jarre and director George P. Cosmatos should have made a choice between Earp and Holliday and they didn't. That's a shame and it makes 130 minutes a heck of a long time. Luckily, like I mentioned before, Val Kilmer is a pleasure to watch and Jason Priestley and Billy Zane are acting very good as well. The scenery's are very impressing and Joseph Porro's customs are nearly perfect. All of this keeps the movie watchable, but not much more that that I'm afraid.",6,3,5,9 November 2001
