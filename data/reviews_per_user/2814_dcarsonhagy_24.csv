10 Cloverfield Lane," Out of the Frying Pan...Back Into the Frying Pan
","Boy, howdy, was I ever surprised by this one!! I absolutely refused to watch any trailers/teasers for this film because I did not want them to ruin my viewing of this movie. I would suggest that for others as well.'10 Cloverfield Lane' tells a story of a young woman who, in the opening scenes, has apparently broken off an engagement with her fianc√©e. She has packed a suitcase and is driving to whatever her next destination may be. While she stops for gas, a truck pulls up behind her. That was just the beginning of the tension. After she leaves the gas station, she receives a phone call from her boyfriend, but is not able to complete it because her car is struck (by something) and she is then tossed down an embankment. When she awakens, she finds herself cuffed to a pipe, her leg incapacitated. Enter John Goodman, who plays Howard. He gives a new meaning to creepiness. I am not going to tell any more of the story, nor what it embodies. All I can tell you is that I was thoroughly entertained from beginning to end. There are twists and turns aplenty, and just when you think you have it all figured out, you find out you couldn't be any further from the truth. Smartly directed and wonderfully acted, '10 Cloverfield Lane' is somewhere you never want to end up.The movie is rated PG-13; however, save for a couple of words, it could have been rated PG. There is no blood and gore here, so if you're a fan of that, you'll have to look somewhere else. Atmosphere, acting, and directing take this movie STEPS above others of its genre. Highly Recommended.",9,2,2,14 June 2016
Fury," One of the Best Movies about WWII
","I put off for a while watching this movie because IMO Brad Pitt has made many poor movie choices recently. Caught this on On-Demand last evening and was riveted from beginning to end.The story tells a tale about 'Wardaddy' (Brad Pitt) and his merry band of fellow tank partners heading toward the front lines in WWII. His men are hardened soldiers who have seen just about everything that war has to offer. Pitt loses one of his original men and a replacement is sent to him--in the form of a clerk typist. 'Fury' is probably the best war film I've seen since 'Saving Private Ryan.' It's gritty, graphic, well acted, and well directed. Brad Pritt is finally able to show his acting chops. He never overplays a scene here; he is constantly pulling back. The ability for him to do that makes his portrayal of 'Wardaddy' that much more believable. There is one scene that was almost too uncomfortable for me to watch. What appears to be a peaceful moment you know could erupt into horrible violence at a moments notice. This film was also educational for me. I found out that in the beginning of WWII our tanks were vastly inferior to German tanks, which were referred to as Tigers. Its only weak spot was located in the rear, so I can only imagine how difficult it must have been to get in position and try to attack those.The movie is rated 'R,' and deservingly so. It contains constant language and graphic war-time violence. If you haven't seen this one already, you owe it to yourself to check it out.",8,6,13,29 April 2015
Train to Busan," A Zombie Film with Heart
","'Train to Busan' weaves a tale--and very good one--about how much life is worth living and how we ALL take it for granted. The story starts with a father and his daughter boarding a train in Seoul destined for Busan. Little do they know their innocent trip will eventually end in a fight for their lives and everyone around them.What I enjoyed most about 'Train' was the characters were REAL. Each person played his/her part with panache; therefore, it was easy to feel for each of them. From the homeless man who boards the train with a foreshadowing message to the self-centered father, every part is just as critical as the others. To me, it would be hell on earth if this kind of outbreak happened: nowhere to run; nowhere to hide.'Train' is rated 'R' for violence, language, and disturbing images. It takes the zombie genre to a completely different level with its superb acting and photography. In Korean with subtitles, this one is recommended.",7,4,8,27 December 2016
Green Room," Don't Go in There
","'Green Room' was a daring attempt to portray how things go from bad to worse for a touring punk rock band. They wind up playing at a venue for neo-Nazis, witness a murder, and then have to fight for their lives in order to escape. The late Anton Yelchin was excellent as Pat, one of the group's guitar players. His supporting cast was also top-notch. The viewer will feel a sense of being trapped with no way out. All involved in this movie does a fine job of acting their roles without overdoing it. Patrick Stewart, however, seemed like a turd in a punch bowl-- completely out of place. There was nothing special about his role-- anyone could have played it. He did not come across cold-blooded, menacing, or threatening. I suppose those involved thought if we add another 'name,' this will attract more viewers.Now, you may be asking yourself why I did not rate it any higher than I did. One of many reasons was the script was a little confusing. Also, what happens to some of the characters (violence- wise) left me scratching my head. I understand (and have said this many times) in some movies you just have to throw caution to the wind, but some of the outcomes of the battles were just too much.Rated 'R' for graphic violence and language, 'Green Room' isn't a bad movie, and I give it a minimal recommendation.",6,0,3,16 August 2016
The Hateful Eight," Tarantino Has Run out of Ideas
","Since there is absolutely just about NOTHING to watch on television anymore, a friend and I decided to check out Tarantino's latest offering, 'The Hateful Eight' last evening. I should have read a book.This was one of the most stomach-turning assault on the senses I have ever witnessed. You are treated to several characters that no one could ever like, much less 'pull for' in any situation. They are all indeed hateful, yet what Tarantino did to his characters induces more than just hate from its viewers.John Ruth (played by Kurt Russell), an infamous bounty hunter, is on his way to Red Rock, WY, with his prisoner, Daisy Domergue (played by Jennifer Jason Leigh) in tow. He is going to make sure she hangs and he gets the $10,000 bounty placed on her head. Traveling by stagecoach, they are trying to outrun a blizzard. Along the way, Ruth picks up Maj.Marquis Warren (played by Samuel L. Jackson), and newly elected sheriff of Rock Ridge, Chris Mannix, (played by Walter Goggins). They travel as far as they can but have to hole up in a haberdashery with four other curious fellows. I will not go any further into the plot.Tarantino is well known for his excesses in his movies, and this one is no different. That being said, I believe Tarantino needs to be told by someone that sometimes less is more. This movie, which lasts close to three hours, is chock full of the 'N' word (it seemed at one point, it was every OTHER word), the 'F'-bomb, G-d's, MF's; you name it; it's in there. I have said on many occasions that Tarantino is living out his biggest fantasies in his films, and one of those fantasies is being a misogynist. Daisy, it would seem, is only in ANY scene in order for her to either get punched in the mouth, pistol whipped, or to have her teeth knocked out. How Leigh ever got an Oscar nomination for this role still has me puzzled. And a flashback story the Major tells was simply nauseating. Also, someone please explain to me how Ennio Morricone received an Oscar for best musical score. This movie is rated 'R' and contains male on male sodomy, full nudity, graphic violence, and language. Adults (especially parents) are STRONGLY CAUTIONED about who they may let view this. I would say it should not be viewed by anyone under 18. For all of his movies, Tarantino has finally gotten his point across: He has absolutely nothing to say.",2,1,5,4 April 2016
Doctor Strange," A Drug Free Psychedelic Ride!
","Caught this one last evening On-Demand. I was hooked from the beginning until the end! The opening scene will definitely catch your attention, too. Dr. Strange tells a story of Dr. Stephen Strange, considered to be the best neurosurgeon in the world. Well, at least that's what HE thinks. Arrogant, aloof, and overbearing as all get out, it is safe to say Dr. Strange is just about void of friends and/or relationships. This is where the movie gets a little 'tricky' because Strange's character comes off as such an a-hole, I thought I might not finish the movie. That can be attributed to Benedict Cumberbatch's performance as Dr. Strange. He is simply wonderful. However, as the Fates usually have it, Dr. Strange is involved in a horrible auto accident and both his hands--and his world--are shattered. It is during his convalescence when he stumbles upon what he thinks is an urban legend regarding a man involved in an accident who had severe (and untreatable) injuries to his spine, yet was seen walking in New York. When Dr. Strange listens to this man's story about his 'spiritual' healing, he then sets out to see if he can help himself. He travels to Nepal (Kathmandu) and encounters 'The Ancient One,' expertly played by Tilda Swinson, and his 'journey' begins.'Dr. Strange' is one of the best movies I've seen this year. Expertly cast and directed, the movie tells a very engaging story-- something most 'Marvel' movies do not. All the characters were interesting, the special effects were indeed very special, and I was captivated until the end. Rated PG-13 for violence and disturbing images, I recommend this one for everyone. Hope you enjoy!",10,0,2,14 March 2017
American Sniper," The Horror of War
","'American Sniper' is far and away the best movie of its genre. It tells the true tale of Chris Kyle, an American sniper. He four tours of duty in Afghanistan before he finally decided to get out of the business, so to speak. Bradley Cooper gives a spectacular performance as the main character. From his accent to his body language throughout the movie, Cooper again shows he is one of the most under-rated actors of this time. After watching this, I feel he should have won the Oscar for best actor. He never seemed out of his element and because his portrayal was so honest, it was easy to feel sympathy for him. Much has been said about how Hollywood could portray a 'murderer' as a hero. I would like to point out to all who have a problem with this: GET OVER IT. Could I do what he did? Hell no. But war is war, and sometimes in order to survive you do what you may not WANT to do, but what you HAVE to do. To Chris, his duty was to protect his country and his men, and he did that with no apologies. In the movie, Kyle tells a psychiatrist that he was prepared to meet his maker and answer for every shot he took. 'American Sniper' is a gritty look at an even grittier 'job.' For people to damn this man is unforgivable. If it were not for men like Chris Kyle, this country may not have most of its taken-for- granted freedoms.The movie is rated 'R' for graphic violence and language. It is HIGHLY recommended.",9,16,29,26 May 2015
The Lost City of Z," A Journey to Nowhere
","'The Lost City of Z' is an ambitious movie (based on fact) regarding Percival Fawcett, an English explorer who sets his sites on Bolivia. He learns of a 'lost city' and decides if he should discover such a place, it could change history. He finds traces of such a city on his first outing, but is so ridiculed and doubted by his fellow Brits, he realizes he will receive no further help and must now look for the City on his own.The movie is well acted, directed, and the cinematography is absolutely breathtaking. It is rather slow, but there is so much covered in the film, you need time to process everything thrown at you. Personally, I always had a sense of dread during the movie. Mr. Fawcett explored a jungle that had never been explored before and encountered mostly cannibalistic tribes during his searches.The movie is rated PG-13 for violence and adult situations.",8,1,2,25 July 2017
The Revenant," The Never Ending Movie
","I finally got around to watching 'The Revenant' last evening. It won three Oscars (total) for best actor (DiCaprio); best director; and best cinematography. Anyone who watches it should win an award for perseverance.The story is about a man and his son, both fur trappers, who get caught in the middle of all sorts of savagery. Their hunting party is attacked by Indians and most of their men are killed. After trying to come to some sort of plan, the remaining parties set on for a nearby fort. DiCaprio's character goes off on his own (to hunt, I suppose) and is savagely mauled by a grizzly bear. He is then left for dead by his own hunting party, and the remainder of the film has him searching for the person responsible for killing his son, a fellow hunter named John Fitzgerald, played superbly by Tom Hardy. First of all, I was not impressed all that much by this film. I do not understand the rave reviews it got, and am even more turned off by the tales of its over-bearing director. Rumor has it that Tom Hardy choked his ass out!! But I digress. I am glad DiCaprio won the Oscar, but anyone who knows his work knows he should have won for other roles. I had a huge problem with the ending. The viewer has to sit through almost three hours of watching a man savaged by animals, other men, and the elements, with the only thing keeping him alive--his revenge on the guy who murdered his son. Yet, the ending seemed so contrived to me that it was as though the director said, 'Okay; I've had it with this project. Time to go home.' Either that or it's akin to having sex for better than two and half hours with absolutely no pay off.Rated 'R' for graphic violence, rape, castration, and nudity.",5,7,12,21 April 2016
The Conjuring 2," The Best Horror Movie I've Seen in a Long Time
","While I enjoyed the original 'Conjuring,' I was left a little wanting. I thought if the first 60 minutes of the film had been as intense as the last 30, it would have been a great horror tale. Well, Director James Wan has created its sequel and, let me tell you, it is one intense ride. Ed and Lorraine Warren (played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) are back as the paranormal couple who go where few dare to tread. They are asked to investigate a supposed haunting/possession of a 12-year old girl in England named Janet Hodgson. It seems she has been tormented by the ghost of a 71 year old man who died in the house her family now inhabits. Oh, but leave it to Wan to make it so much more than that!As in the original 'Conjuring,' this story opens with a reference to another case of alleged possession--the Amityville mass murders. While investigating there, Lorraine keeps having premonitions of her husband's impending death. She also discovers a very dark and evil presence, which decides to take the form of a demented nun.James Wan shows he is a master of this genre. He also shows that an audience can be scared to death simply by using camera tricks, shadows, and effective make-ups. His actors deliver top-notch performances, especially Madison Wolfe who plays the tormented child. To me, this film (as the original) should have been rated PG-13. There is no blood, gore, nudity, or sexual situations. In fact, I have racked my brain trying to remember if I even heard a cuss word and, for the life of me, I don't. However, don't let the lack of those hackneyed and worn out situations stop you from seeing this movie. It is the best horror movie I have seen in a long time, and I will even admit, I had trouble sleeping the night after I saw the movie. Enjoy!",10,1,3,26 June 2016
It Follows," It...Blows
","'It Follows' is just plain bad. I don't know why or what caused all the hub-bub, but this was one of the silliest movies I've seen in quite some time. I was lost from the very beginning. It seems some girl, wearing red pumps--and I do mean SEVERE pumps--is all in a tither. Over what, I never really knew; I could guess, but if 'it' was after her, why on god's green earth would she choose to run from it wearing severe red pumps? But I digress.It seems whatever 'it' encompasses is passed from one to the next victim by means of sexual transmission. If you get 'it', you may never get rid of 'it.' So what you basically have is a movie where a bunch of morons drive around quite a bit, people who lurch menacingly about, and I'm supposed to be scared. And there's the ending. Don't worry; I will NOT give it away, but to me it just said 'we're desperate to end this movie and we really don't know how, so we'll just do this.' Rated 'R' for language, brief nudity, and (laughable) images, perhaps it's time for me to stop reviewing horror period. Most movies of this genre nowadays are poorly made, horribly acted, make no sense, and are only interested in vile and nasty ways to off people. I certainly do not abhor violence, but violence-for- violence sake has grown quite tiring. Trouble is, I LOVE horror. I just find so little to like about it anymore.",4,10,75,9 May 2015
Legend," The Cramps
","'Legend' is the latest take of the story of the infamous Kray Twins, Reggie and Ron. These two rose to fame in London during the 60s through robbing, looting, and gambling. Tom Hardy does a remarkable job in playing both title roles. However, that is just about all this latest movie has going for it. This is another movie where the British accents are so heavy, I feel you need subtitles. It took me a good 20 minutes to finally get into the movie where I could understand what was being said. The director does an odd thing here in having Reggie's girlfriend, Frances Shea, narrate the story. She loves Reggie; she hates Ron. The reasons for her hating the other brother are easily seen. Ron was not only mentally ill, but he was a savage. There was no such thing as 'too much violence' to please him. Reggie finally marries Frances, but the marriage dissolves into rubble because Reggie's family does not approve, and Reggie turns out to be just as big an ass as his brother.The 1990 movie entitled 'The Krays' is a much better film. That movie focused on the gangster aspect, where 'Legend' bores its audience to death with a hackneyed love story. The director (and all others involved) should have made their minds up early on as to what they wanted to do because their 'mixture' did not do anything but bore me to tears. Rated 'R' for violence, drug use, sexual situations, and language, 'Legend' is just not that entertaining.",3,1,2,7 March 2016
Magic Mike XXL," False Advertising
","'Magic Mike XXL' is another needless sequel made only for a quick buck and that's it. The story supposedly picks up three years after Mike hunched away from the business to get married and pursue the dream of the white picket fence. He now owns his own business-- complete with ONE employee--yet he seems lost. Yawn. He gets a call from some of his former stripper buddies because they all want to go to Myrtle Beach, SC for one last blowout.Had this movie lasted only 85-90 minutes, it MIGHT have been bearable. Unfortunately, this little turd clocks in at just UNDER two hours. That's two hours of mostly TALKING about crap that nobody cares about. There's drug use, a trip to a drag bar, visits to former lust interests, and FINALLY the not-so-grand finale. There really was no rhyme or reason to make this film. I cared little to nothing about the characters in the first film, although Matthew McConaughey's character, Dallas, at least made that film somewhat interesting. What you have here is basically a sequel about vapid strippers who, if they are not stripping, really have nothing interesting to say.Rated R and not recommended.",3,8,11,9 October 2015
Logan," Logan
","Firstly, I don't think I'll be spoiling anything since this movie has been out for quite some time. Aside from the obvious, I will try and not delve too far into the movie that I may ruin it for those who have not seen it.'Logan' picks up somewhere in the future with Logan caring for a very sick Professor X. However, Logan has also started to notice something about himself. He is not as unstoppable as he once was, he tires rather quickly now, and his wounds are not healing the way they used to. He is also very sick, but doesn't know why--just yet.In trying to move Professor X to a safer location from all the goons who are after him, he is approached by a woman who tells him she and her daughter need to be taken to a place in North Dakota called 'Eden.' This is some sort of safe-haven from all peoples trying to kill them. The daughter's name is Laura. During one of many fight scenes, Logan witnesses the sheer brutality of Laura who kills at will and seems to enjoy it. After a perilous journey for all concerned, Logan will eventually realize something he never knew.I realized I was really going to enjoy this movie because the first word that came out of Logan's mouth was the f-bomb! And believe me, that is just one of MANY f-bombs. The violence factor has been way upped in this one, too. Flying limbs, holes blown through heads, decapitations, and death by wood debris are just a few of the new touches. No more of that PG-13 stuff to appease parents!The performances are also top-of-the-line here--especially by Hugh Jackman, Dafne Keen (as Laura), and Patrick Stewart as Professor X. This is simply the best movie in a series that has been around quite a long time. I loved it and it left me with a big lump in my throat when it ended. Rated R for graphic violence, adult language, and very brief nudity.",10,2,7,24 May 2017
Beauty and the Beast," Beauty and the Beast (2017)
","The remake of 'Beauty and the Beast' is Disney's latest in live action animation. Blending real actors with CGI, it's a story most of us know (and love) about Belle and the Beast. Emma Watson (of Harry Potter fame) plays Belle, a simple country girl who is looking for her Prince Charming. She lives an ordinary life in an ordinary town surrounded by ordinary people. Trouble is, they think SHE'S strange. Gaston, the local hunk, has decided he must make Belle his wife since she clearly isn't interested in him. Fate, however, has other plans for both of them.Although the film was very pretty to look at, it lacked depth and simply did not have the heart the animated version had. I love Emma Watson, but her singing voice was adequate at best. Kevin Kline (who portrayed Belle's father) looked like he would rather be anywhere but where he was. It was Luke Evans (as Gaston) that stole the show. He stayed true to the character of Gaston, and man could he belt out a tune! Another problem I had is Disney trying to introduce a sexually confused character, LeFou. I wish someone would try to explain to me why this was done because, quite frankly, I am sick and tired of people trying to rewrite fairy tales just to make them 'politically correct.' Rated PG and even with its flaws, I would still recommend it.",8,40,63,8 June 2017
The Witch," Religious Madness
","I finally was able to catch this film On-Demand last evening. Since it did not play in my town--as most types of these films NEVER do--I waited patiently for its availability. 'The Witch' is a tale set in New England around 1630. A Puritan family has been banished from their local town because it seems the father was teaching religion that was in direct conflict with what was widely believed in this area. The family ventures out into the wilderness to restart their lives. Little do they know of the horror that waits.I have read many other IMDb reviews and I can see how this film can be loved AND how it can be hated. Several scenes seemed incomplete. There are incidences that just do not make sense, i.e. the abduction of the baby by the Witch. Why did they not search for the child? Who was the Witch? Did she really exist? It is only until much later in the film that (I think) someone references the baby was taken by a wolf. I am still puzzled over the final scene, which I will not reveal.I thought the acting was superb; however, I will say (again) that when you do a period piece with heavy British brogue, I just wish closed captioning was available. I had so much trouble understanding what was being said that it actually took my attention away from what was happening on screen. Anya Taylor-Joy is remarkable in her portrayal of the oldest daughter, Thomasin. Ralph Ineson plays the father, William very effectively, while Kate Dickie (who plays the mother, Katherine) proves she can wail with the best of them. The music and cinematography were both exceptional. Director Robert Eggers seems to know his way about the camera!While this movie was billed as 'horror,' to me it is simply a tale about what religion and all its trappings can do to even the strongest of minds. There is some real tension here, and it was very refreshing to see a horror movie that was actually character driven.Rated 'R' for violence and nudity--and NONE of it graphic--'The Witch' is definitely a cut above most movies of its kind. However, I will caution any potential viewer to be aware of the pace and the accents. The movie is a little slow, and I've already stated what I felt about the heavy British brogues. Still, I would recommend it.",7,3,5,17 May 2016
Sausage Party," Nothing But Filler
","I am flabbergasted by the reviews that (I'm sure) were written by early teens. 'Outrageously funny, vulgar, and crass'? Well, two out of three isn't bad I suppose. The idiot who came up with this idea should win an Oscar for duping an entire 'community.' If you can sell this POS, you should run for president. There is simply nothing here to see, hear, taste, or whatever. In fact, I had my fill after the first five minutes. Every other word is the F-bomb (or some form of it). Every sentence uttered is a double-entendre. Something like this MIGHT entertain kiddies on their first date. Doubtful, but maybe. Have we not gotten past the use of dirty words just for the sake of using dirty words? 'Sausage Party' is not funny. I watched it and never cracked a smile. It is so unoriginal, unfunny, and completely lacking in character that it should be burned. You can take a turd and polish it until it shines--even dress it up if you like. But in the end, you've still got nothing but a turd. I cannot wait to see how many 'dislikes' this review gets but, as Rhett Butler uttered, 'Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.'Rated 'R' and not worth seeing.",1,10,18,12 December 2016
"Hail, Caesar!"," What the Hail Did I Just Watch?
","It actually has happened. I watched a Coen-Brothers movie that I absolutely could not stand! 'Hail, Caesar' is, without a doubt, one of the worst excuses ever for a movie. In actuality, it does not even come across as a complete movie, rather a bunch of vignettes that could not, under any given circumstances, be linked to form the same movie.Josh Brolin plays Mannix, a Hollywood 'fixer'--i.e. he fixes any kind of problem(s) which may arise on the set of any movie. George Clooney plays Baird Whitlock, the star of the studio's upcoming blockbuster, 'Hail Caesar.' Seemingly despised by a good majority of the other actors who are under contract to this studio, he is drugged and kidnapped during the filming of this blockbuster. The rub here is he is kidnapped by communist Hollywood writers who lecture him on why they should share in all the profits any movie makes which have been penned by them. Yawn.Many other stars are also in this movie, albeit for maybe one or two lines, or five minutes of screen time (tops). Scarlett Johanson, Ralph Fiennes, Channing Tatum, Tilda Swinton--just to name a few-- appear as various characters who appear nominally for the sake of filler. I did enjoy Tilda Swinton's dual role as gossip columnists Thora and Thessaly Thacker. The scene with Fiennes trying to get actual acting out of a hopeless cowboy reject simply went on for too long, thus removing any--and there wasn't much--comedy. I have no clue what/why Channing Tatum's character was all about.I knew watching this was going to be a 50-50 chance considering it had not been all that long ago this movie had a major nationwide release, yet was now on On-Demand. Rated PG-13 for language, this was just awful.",2,4,6,12 June 2016
Kong: Skull Island," King Kong: Skull Island
","Oh brother. Yet ANOTHER story about King Kong. This time he's on his own island (it's unexplored, see...), only to be disturbed by some people who, oh, who cares?Where Peter Jackson's 'King Kong' had heart and soul, this gobbler has neither. In fact, the only thing this one has is a ton of CGI. King Kong doesn't look real; it looks like a man in a bad monkey suit. And what were those monsters he fought? They looked like Pterodactyls. In other words, they were not frightening.The cast managed to sleepwalk their way through the film. The only saving grace was John Ryan, even though there was not that much to his character. Samuel L. Jackson's portrayal of the 'bad guy' was caricature-ish and unbelievable. I understand any director wanting to cast Mr. Jackson as the villain, but at least give him something to work with.Rated PG-13 for science-fiction violence and some adult language.",4,2,5,9 April 2017
Straight Outta Compton," One of the Best Films of 2015
","I watched this (with great caution) on On-Demand. To say I was blown away, would be a huge understatement. To say this is one of the best films of 2015 doesn't do the service this film deserves.'Straight Outta Compton' is a music bi-op about the rap group N.W.A., which was formed circa 1987. That group consisted of Eazy- E, Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, and others. The group hit profoundly with fans because of their no-holds-barred lyrics and the messages behind them. They were the first balls-to-the-wall gangsta rap group. They did not apologize for their lyrics, their songs messages, of for themselves. Their music reflected their lives--what they lived, breathed, and witnessed every day in Compton. As a 62 year-old white dude, my eyes were opened to a life I did not understand simply because I did not have to live it. Constantly harassed by policemen--even black policemen--simply because they were young and black AND pigeon-holed into every stereotypical category imaginable, they learned to fight back with their music.There is quite a stink concerning the fact that the Oscars failed (again) to recognize ANY black actor for their performances. I can honestly say they certainly failed with regard to this movie. O'Shea Jackson (as Ice Cube), Jason Mitchell (Eazy-E), and Corey Hawkins (Dr. Dre) ALL deserved at least nominations for supporting actor. I actually thought Jason Mitchell's performance was worthy of a Best Actor nod. Director F. Gary Gray did an absolutely incredible job in keeping the pace, the flow, and acting at a believable pace. Both the good and uglier facets of this lifestyle were examined, and Gray never shied away from anything. I saw (and recommend) the unrated Director's cut of the movie, which lasts 167 minutes. This is the best movie I have seen in 2015. It's a shame it will not get the accolades it deserves. The unrated version contains constant graphic language, nudity, violence, and drug use. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",10,1,22,26 January 2016
Life," When Will Scientists Learn?
","'Life' is a very intelligent, well-crafted sci-fi thriller concerning the discovery of life on another planet. Six crew members on an international space station discover an organism from the planet Mars. The head scientist tinkers, zaps, and prods the organism until viola it comes to life. First appearing as a very innocuous life form, the scientists on the ship simply won't leave well enough alone and pretty soon everyone is fighting for their lives.I enjoyed this movie because of its realism. Unlike most science fiction movies, gravity does play a major role. The crew members are not 'ambulatory' but move as if they are floating through the air. More story driven than creature driven, 'Life' turned out to be a very taut, imaginative thriller. As in any movie, Ryan Reynolds and Jake Gyllenhaal deliver knockout performances.Rated 'R' for science fiction violence, disturbing images, and language I say give this one a try.",7,1,3,20 June 2017
What We Do in the Shadows," It's Your Turn to do the Dishes
","I caught this little hidden gem on HBO the other night. I laughed until I darn near peed myself. It is so refreshing to see a movie of this type that simply refuses to take itself seriously. I think I so enjoyed this because I had not seen any trailer, advertisements, or hype about this movie. Face it, most movies whose trailer runs for, oh, six months or so, usually wind up not being worth a dime. In fact, the best parts of the movie are usually found in the trailer.'What We Do in the Shadows' is a story about very old vampires trying to adapt to the new day. When it opens, the household is about to have some sort of meeting. I was expecting something weird...and you find out they are meeting because one of them will not do his only assigned household chore, i.e. washing the dishes. They have this intense meeting that ends with all of them levitating and hissing at one another! One has his own familiar to do his dirty work. She longs for the world of the vampire, but keeps getting put off by her master. She provides victims, which they turn one into a vampire and he cannot keep his mouth shut, so everybody knows what's going on. And their rivalry with a local pack of werewolves damn near put me over the edge.I cannot say enough good things about this movie. There is comedy galore, a 'beast,' and the script was well written and very well acted. Kudos to these guys. I enjoyed everything about this one and highly recommend it for viewing.The movie is rated 'R' for violence and some language. Enjoy yourself!",8,0,1,23 December 2015
Deadpool," Loved It!!
","Very few times have I ever fallen head-over-heels for movie...in its opening credits!! Such was the case for 'Deadpool.' I mean, when the credits display 'Directed By: Some Tool,' I knew I was in for a good time.Due to a complete loss of any kind of imagination, recently movie goers have been inundated with every movie imaginable concerning Marvel and its 'super heroes.' Most have been huge disappointments, some were 'meh,' and very few were actually entertaining. 'Deadpool' had me from start to finish. I mean, c'mon, who could not like a character by the name of 'Negasonic Teenage Warhead'?!It is a story about a former Special Ops mercenary, Wade Wilson, played remarkably well by Ryan Reynolds. He is trying to get out of the business, but as luck would have it, he just cannot seem to break free. He falls in love and when he finally musters the courage to pop the question, receives some awful news. Even the villain in this movie was a cut above the rest. 'Ajax,' who seems to have a narcissistic personality, was completely bad- ass. He was also superbly played by Ed Skrein, who, if memory serves me correctly, was formerly in 'Game of Thrones.' His sidekick, although not named, was one tough broad.This movie lasts 108 minutes and is rated 'R' for non-stop graphic violence, language, simulated sex, and nudity. Other reviews I have read list 'graphic nudity.' I do not even know what that is. If you're nude, you're nude; there's nothing graphic about that.Anyhoo, I cannot recommend this enough. If this site had 'half- stars,' this would definitely garner a 9.5 from me. Enjoy yourself.",9,3,10,12 May 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," A Step Way Above the Rest
","'Mad Max Fury Road' was a movie I decided to see with great trepidation. I thought it was a remake of 'The Road Warrior.' A friend of mine pointed out to me that this was a reboot of the franchise. I'm glad I listened.All I ask for in an action movie is, well, action. However, some have failed to live up to a very simple premise. Such was not the case here. The action began at the start of the movie, and it did not end until the movie was over. The cinematography and art direction were absolutely superb. Colors were used to the greatest effort to depict various moods. The story is simple: a crazed ruler lords over a vast area of wasteland. He is in charge of the water and the vegetation. He also pedals flesh in the form of his breeders--women who are sent to various places to repopulate this barren nothingness. Max and his band of merry widows (so to speak) are trying to find the 'green patch' in all this desolation. Tom Hardy (as Max) and Charlese Theron (as the female lead) were terrific. The supporting cast was very good, and the stunts and visual effects were out of this world. This movie is rated 'R' for violence and adult situations. I highly recommend this one.",8,0,7,8 September 2015
