It," Better than the old one, but less scary.
","First off this is a great movie but... its not that scary. There were a few moments where I jumped but not a lot, I would've given 'it' a 9 if they actually made it a bit scary. Definitely a good watch. I cant wait for IT part 2 too come out. Hopefully the director makes it better than this one, what I mean by that I want it to actually be scary. Id rate this a 13 to 14+.",7,1,2,13 November 2017
