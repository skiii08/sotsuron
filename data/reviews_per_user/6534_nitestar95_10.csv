The Blair Witch Project," Basically a prequel to all the youtube 'my reaction to' clips
","Nothing scary is actually seen, what we have is 80 minutes of selfie videos of a group of ignorant teens in search of a scary experience. And they get exactly that; it's all created in their minds. I watched many people walk right out of the theater when it was released, and then when playing it for my family (they wanted to know what all the fuss was about) most quickly tired of it. So if you're a fan of reaction videos, this the movie for you. But it's not scary. So Enjoy!",1,3,7,28 March 2019
Hereditary," Borderline at best. Perhaps good if you're 13.
","I'm guessing that most of the reviews here are from horror fans who are easily terrified, because I found nothing about this movie to be scary at all. The poor plot, and all the holes in it, make the story just plain bad. And the ending? Bad as well. The audience around me in the theater wasn't happy with it either. Just a mediocre movie, the 'B' type that we used to watch as kids as the second of a double feature back in the 60's. But by all means, judge for yourself. You'll have plenty of urges to get up and walk to the snack bar or bathroom, because this film will not keep you in your seat.",1,1,5,5 July 2018
In Bruges," Stupid people and stupid script.
","I rarely write reviews, but this tripe inspired me. It could have been called stupid people doing stupid things. One killer can't shut up; it seems he believes other people are fascinated at everything that goes on in his life, to the minutest detail. The script is full of holes. People that hold a gun on someone close enough for them to take it away. A supposedly professional killer walking through a park with his weapon held in his hand for all to see. And the stupidity goes on and on. Things that no one with an ounce of common sense would do. So if you enjoy foolishness and like to believe it makes perfect sense, watch this film.",1,31,80,31 July 2009
The Jungle Book," Terrific! Not a dull moment.
","I went to look for lists of great G rated movies for children, and was shocked that this wasn't on it. It's basically one of the best animated movies ever made. Great story, wonderful characters, good music, there's nothing it lacks. So to find it rated 7.6 by the IMDB faithful, shocked me.
Watch this movie. Buy it when you can. You and your children, and grandchildren, will watch it over, and over again, as we have.",10,0,0,20 May 2020
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Can't terrorize a car with a motorcycle.
","Could have been good. But when writers put stuff like this in, where someone is trying to go after a killer by chasing a car with a motorcycle, it becomes ridiculous. You can't. All the car has to do, especially on a wet road, is jam on the brakes, or sideswipe the bike off the road. Idiot writers never learn.",2,1,4,29 July 2018
Quantum of Solace," When did ADD become the standard for filming?
","I'd put off seeing this one simply because everyone was telling me things that I didn't want to believe. A Bond film that stinks?? Can't be. But then I watched it. Seldom does any camera get to film an entire scene if at all; by reducing each video segment to only a few seconds at most, the continuity simply gets lost. In this movie's case, it hides the fact that it's mostly all just a bunch of clips strung together; this is especially noticed in the fight scenes, which when pieced together with one or two second clips make it seem like an edited creation rather than a fight. I guess that's what happens when you have actors that are aging and cannot be engaged in such an altercation for more than a couple of seconds at a time. So all we have is pieced together action. Great if that's what you like. I'd really rather have a better storyline. This one was just painful to watch.",1,11,15,1 June 2011
Three Colors: Blue," Warning for English viewers...
","There are some references to an English audio stream; it is similar to an explanatory type narrative over the french audio. There is no English dubbing. If you're like me, and like to immerse yourself into a movie and find that having to read subtitles seriously diminishes that experience, you might want to avoid this series of films. It also tends to be an 'artsy' film; much is left unsaid, and you have to derive a lot of meaning from the backgrounds in the films. I don't like movies that I have to watch several times just to understand 'everything the director is trying to say'; if a director isn't able to clearly convey what he/she wants us to feel, maybe they're in the wrong business. Being vague in a mystery can be a plus; but in a drama it just makes the plot murky and confusing.",5,1,15,25 December 2006
Marriage Story," Just another film that shows stupid people doing stupid things
","I couldn't sit through this entire movie; it took four times, and that's never a good sign. I usually enjoy watching movies where the characters are at least portrayed as being at least minimally intelligent, don't have tantrums, have reasonable judgement, are patient for at least a few minutes before going off on a tirade, and have the knowledge of at least a high school graduate. Instead, we get adults behaving like children, and who appear to have learned nothing since then. I'm not saying that all characters should be reasonable in all respects, and genius in most, but it does get tiring watching idiotic and selfish behavior. I'm guessing that the writer(s) reflect their own capabilities and feelings into the characters that they create. Which means that I probably won't be expecting much from Noah in the future.",4,4,13,14 January 2020
Lucy," Lots of shooting & action. Not much of a plot
","This movie suffers from the same things that a lot of other recent films do: reliance on action, CG, and lots of explosive color. However, it fails in too many ways. Lots of foreign language with no way to know what's being said leaves the audience in the dark. Symbolism used but never explained, I didn't get a lot of it until I read the information on wiki explaining it. All this leaves a lot to be desired; the director and screenwriter have failed on a grand scale to tell their story. Any movie that you have to see multiple times to understand it, or need to read the director's explanation after watching it, is poorly written. As this is one of those, it doesn't qualify as decent entertainment as a movie. Perhaps it does as a puzzle. But most people don't want to go view puzzles without the information of how to put them together; in this way, this movie is like a jigsaw puzzle of a monotone piece of cardboard, cut up into a thousand pieces, so you have no way to figure out which piece goes where. Still, the light show was enjoyable to watch, much as a fireworks display is. But it's basically meaningless without knowing what it's supposed to represent.",3,2,8,10 May 2019
Midway," Disjointed, poor continuity due to filming it in bits and pieces.
","Too many camera changes, well over 2000. I had to watch this a few times to figure out just what was wrong with it; there was just something not quite right. The scenes didn't 'flow' together, it seemed like it was all just stuck together. Then it hit me; it was just 'all stuck together'. Each scenes is almost all just quick one or two second video clips, joined to create the final product. Then that is joined to make another. No cohesion. No continuity. You very rarely see both characters in a conversation at the same time, because they weren't there at the same time; each was filmed from behind so you saw the other person without any camera behind them. So it feels disjointed. I watched it three tijmes, and averaged 2136 separate video clips for the entire movie. All were taken separetely. No wonder if feels like it's not together; because you don't get to see the characters interact; you only see one at a time; when that one is done speaking, the other takes a turn. Same with the flying. You see the pilot, they cut away and all you see is feet, or all you see it stick, or all you see is throttle. It's never the whole person. When two people are in a conversation, you have no idea what the other person is feeling/thinking while the other character speaks, because you can't see their face. They may as well be talking to a manniquin. Perhaps it's cheaper to do it this way? Short solo scenes are easier for actors do to, less to memorize for each couple of sentences, and of course, with only one person speaking in each clip, it's easy to just have one person do it. Watch the 1976 version and see the difference (that one, BTW, has a total of 1023 scenes). Don't take my word for it. Watch both. See which flows better. Yes, the 2019 film has plenty of explosions, lots of shooting, but the story? Nope. Plane appears to be flying directly into the side of a ship, but comes out high on the other side. HOW? We never see it. All the flying here is CGI and special effects. Nothing real like you see in the 1976 version.
Oh yes, and the first 25 minutes of this 2019 film, were of the attack on Pearl Harbor, then some more on the Doolittle raid on Tokyo. So they apparently had to rush through the story about Midway. Perhaps a terrific movie for a Saturday matinee for the kiddies.",5,3,10,11 November 2019
