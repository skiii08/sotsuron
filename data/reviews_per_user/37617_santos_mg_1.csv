The Lobster," Painful
","At the beginning, weird but OK. Then I just was making an effort to see, and then finally I fell asleep two times. Not a comedy, nor a drama, just a waste of time. Sincirely this movie is very bad, and not even Colin Farrell with a great performance could save it. I love Rachel Weisz and felt she was okay.The story was somewhat interesting, in a parallel reality kind of way,but it was too boring. The story line had everything to be a good movie, I understood the lack of emotions on one hand, and the beginning of love story.This is the word that defines this movie...boring. I'm sorry but I have to say it again....boring.",2,8,11,11 February 2017
