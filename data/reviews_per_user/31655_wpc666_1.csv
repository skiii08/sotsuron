Skyfall," cost down just like HXC mobile phone
","this movie is the worst 007 that I even see in my life. You won't see old ways Bond, because it is cost down everything due to the MGM financial problem. Never except 1. No special weapon, 2. NO pretty girl ( all you have is age 60 old woman) 3. No sports car, ( you only can see a grandfather's car). I don't know why I pay the money see this movie, and savages is 1000 times better than this. they should find Oliver stone teach them how to make movies. anyway, if you don't see, just wait the DVD, I swear to god, it is really bad. Maybe CSI NY is much better than this. I really feel sad from Casino, the 007 get worse and worse.",1,28,57,3 November 2012
