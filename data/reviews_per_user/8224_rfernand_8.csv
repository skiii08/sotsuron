The Blair Witch Project," An interesting experiment
","Designed to provide the ultimate scary experience, 'The Blair Witch Project' severely criticizes 'objective' shots and filmmaking. There are only two 3 seconds-long takes that could be considered objective and not character perspective.You never experience 'plastic' terror in this movie. You do experience the horror of being 'inside' of it. And, of course, your stomach experiences the horror of a camera that is constantly moving.I assume we will be seeing more experiments like this one, not necesarilly in horror movies. I can't imagine a James Bond movie shot this way, but, time will give an answer.Give it a try. I don't think any film-addict will be scared, but rather unsettled with the premise of the moviemaking of the new millennium.",7,0,1,24 October 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Back to a galaxy far, far away
","George Lucas' fourth installment of the Star Wars saga gives us the chance to return 'home'. Most of the X-Geners out there grew up with the Star Wars trilogy. Now it is time for the N-Geners to do so.With impressive special effects, a well written story and a lot of new (and old) characters, Episode I takes us back to a galaxy far, far away.Most professional reviews criticize Jar JAr Binks (the comic relief), or the lack of intrincate 'Clancy-like' plot twists. I'm sure this is a movie for all ages, that captures children as well as grown-ups.So, be a kid again. Go back to Lucas' universe. Forget our everyday problems.It's Fantasy! Enjoy!",6,0,0,2 July 1999
Meet Joe Black," Love is about not hurting the object of one's affection
","As Larry King stated in USA Today, This is what great movies talk about. Love. Death. Family. Honor. Myth. All of these you will find in 'Meet Joe Black'.Again, Anthony Hopkins delights us with an extraordinary performance of a man who faces death.I can't say the same thing about Brad Pitt, who definitely lacked the 'old screening school' to play Death.This is another 'must-see' movie.... specially if you think you're in love. I guarantee you will at least think twice before declaring you're in love after watching this movie.",Null,0,0,24 October 1999
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Kicks ass. Big.
","To tell you the truth, I was skeptical about this movie. 4th by Tarantino... high-budget... highly-anticipated... broken into two volumes so we pay 16 dollars to watch it instead of the regular 8...but it rocks. It really does. Tarantino managed to play a respectful homage to chinese martial arts flicks, while creating a visual fest out of a simple premise. This is what this movie is all about: the visuals. Sit back, relax and open your eyes. And your ears, too.I guarantee you that you will now have a different mind picture for the phrase 'Here comes 'The Bride''.",10,0,1,11 October 2003
Titanic," naaaah....
","I'll be brief: It ain't that good. The characters are lame, the script is awful, the situations are not entirely correct, the F/X ain't that cool... I found Godzilla more amusing... at least you knew it was bad since the beginning. SO, if you get a chance to see 'A night to remember', go and do so. Don't waste your time with Leo DiCucu.",1,8,19,2 June 1999
The Matrix," What makes a film great
","Borrowing a lot from modern-day myths, 'The Matrix' gives the audience a nice experience. From 'Alice in Wonderland' to 'The Wizard of Oz', going through 'Terminator' & 'Dark City', we are cast into a new mythology, where hackers are, as have always been, an elite race of humans (at least when facing computers).A must-see for Sci-Fi/Fantasy fans. Despite the violent scenes, the whole storyline guides us through a parallel world (just like in 'Dr. Who').Go ahead. See it. Find out 'What is The Matrix?'. You'll love it.",9,0,1,26 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," What else can be said?
","Not much can be said about this modern classical movie. A movie that created a whole new universe, that marked an entire generation and created the most succesful expanded universe.This galactic epical adventure gives the audience the opportunity to travel to 'a galaxy far, far away'. Currently adored by many, Star Wars is considered one of the best movies in history. A must-see even if you don't enjoy fantasy.",10,0,0,23 May 1999
The Godfather," A great analysis on culture, family, traditions and dirty business
","I think Francis Ford Coppola has delivered an amazing analysis on family traditions with The Godfather, which I consider his masterpiece.Considering that it opened in 1972, and analyzing all the violence-full sequences, it is not strange to read about it as 'shocking' in several reviews.The Godfather and The Godfather part II are some of the movies you just HAVE to see. In part II, F.F.C. tells two stories: Vito Corleone's acension to power and Michael Corleone's new life as the new Godfather.I'd give them both an 11 out of 10.",10,1,3,17 September 1998
