Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Who wants to fight droids?
","This movie is not on the caliber of my personal favorite 'The Empire Strikes Back', but it is a decent way to begin the trilogy. Jar Jar Binks was of course annoying. And I miss storm troopers, I ask you, who wants to fight robots? Just swipe your lightsaber across them. Hohum bordeom. But it could be a whole lot worse. And I had no problem not accepting it as a Star Wars movie right from 'A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away..'",7,0,0,12 June 1999
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," Great characters and Disney name save this film
","It cant be the animation, in my opinion the worstly done of all Disney movies to date. Dialog doesnt match lips at all, at some points people are talking without moving their lips at all. Things look hastily drawn, and the colors are drab and dark.What really makes this movie special is the characters, Cruella is a great villain. Of course all the cute puppies. Horris and Jasper make great lackies, and all the other rich characters I left out.When you add in the great score, and of course the all important Disney name, you get a decent well grossing family film. Nothing spectacular, but standard Disney fare. A '7'.",Null,1,3,6 June 2000
The 13th Warrior," This is a film?
","I never dreamed it possible for a film to have less of a plot than 'Santa Claus Conquers The Martians', but this mindless flick accomplished it.   You could only like this movie if you enjoy watching gore. Banderas and co fight this bear tribe, then they leave, then they fight them again, then they leave, then they attack a few in their caves, then they leave, then they attack again, then its over, what a complex plot!
   I'm astonished I watched the whole thing. This movie does not deserve the high rating of 1 that I gave it, but I had to at least try to bring down that grossly inaccurate rating.",1,2,10,27 February 2000
The Beach," Builds up to nowhere..
","So we meet our title character (played by Leonardo Dicaprio) trying to find a real vacation in Asia. I wont go to much into the story, but he finds a map to a supposable 'paradise island' with the perfect beach. The story builds up well, as him and his two companions set out for the island.. avoiding a group of thai drug smugglers, and finally reach the beach.    And then well.. then.. nothing. It builds up to nothing. We watch a dull romance sequence between Leo and Francois. Leo goes mad and trapes around the jungle, and then its over.
    It was doing okay, but once he got to the beach I get the distinct impression that the writer said 'well now what?', and finished the end of the story with filler material. A (I think generous) '6'.",6,0,0,18 August 2000
