First Man," Pace & Tension
","This movie was a great experience start to finish. A glimpse into Neil Armstrong's experience as a pilot and a human being delivered with furious pace and intensity. Great balance of adrenaline, fear, loss and love. As someone who pays close attention to user and critic's reviews I found this to be a pleasant surprise. I would have expected higher ratings all around.",9,0,2,29 October 2018
