The Blair Witch Project," Oh thats an old story...
","Three film students travel into the woods of Burketsville, Maryland to document the legend of the Blair Witch only to never return, only there footage is discovered.The film that contributed to and help revitalize the genre for found footage/ first person films. Now in that aspect the film was truly trend-setting. Its story though original failed in many aspects. The film does a decent job in building tension as does its pacing, but for the most part this film only comes off as slightly creepy. A lot of the potential of this film is lost in its three amateur actors who do little but bicker, argue and fight throughout the length of the film. What made this film so immensely popular when it first came out was in its marketing. A lot of film goers at the time felt as though this film was actual true footage, when in turn it was just a low grade horror film. Though a nod has to be given to this film as it did create a new genre within film, that went on to span such films as Cloverfield and Chronicle. All in all for a horror film it misses its mark in some aspects but in others it does very well, which is in its pacing and its tension, but ultimately falls short, mostly in its conclusion, which leaves much to be desired.",5,1,2,26 January 2014

Fight Club," I want you to hit me as hard as you can...
","A troubled insomniac looking for a way to change his mundane existence, meets a charismatic soap salesman. Together they form a new form of therapy which channels primal aggression, an underground fight club that evolves into something far more sinister.A very well acted and expertly directed film. A decent into grimy madness is a great way to describe this raw, emotional slightly skewed film. An extremely dark movie and one in which Pitt and Norton show there true acting skills and range as professionals. A film in which is original in its presentation and in fact in its plot. Dark, Gritty, Dramatic and with a blend of tongue in cheek humor Fight Club is an excellent film, one in which has garnered a huge cult following since its release and not without warrant. First time viewers will feel as though they are spiraling into madness and chaos with each passing moment. Though some might consider this film a tad eccentric its in that revelation that you understand the true unique charm of this film. Fight Club is one of those films that the more you see it the more it will become attached to you, resonate with you and fully entertain you.",8,0,1,3 January 2014
Blade," Just another dead Vampire...
","In a world where vampires stalk and hunt the night, established in multiple facets within our world they fear nothing, except half mortal half vampire Blade. Who hunts and destroys them at all costs. When the powerful vampire lord Decon Frost sets off a chain reaction that will ultimately destroy mankind, it is up to Blade and his allies to put a stop and destroy Frost and his evil ingenious plan.Hyper violent, ultra gory and full of energy, Blade is a tremendous action adventure film. Based on the MARVEL comic book series, Blade with its origins within horror and action are steeped in graphic violence and hyper fighting make it a truly pleasurable film to watch. When first viewed one might not know what to expect, until the first fifteen mins of the film play out. Not the most original or pure film to come out but it is very entertaining. The best of the trilogy and the best written. The soundtrack compliments the film well, Snipes in his most iconic role does a tremendous job playing the ruthless and tormented title character. Stephen Dorff does a fantastic job as the villain Decon Frost. The action is top notch and by the time the film reaches its conclusion you will find yourself deeply immersed and on the edge of your seat. Though unrealistic with its content, it is handled in such a way that it increases the charm and the believe-ability of the film. Blade is a top notch action film.",8,0,1,26 December 2013
The Mummy," Keeper of the Dead...
","An archaeological expedition in the ancient city of Hamunaptra, unearths and awakens an ancient mummy and its curse.A fun and entertaining thrill ride of a movie, with wonderful effects a decent story and pacing. Acting wise this film is sub-par but overly enjoyable if not taken too seriously. Overall this is a popular film with decent characterization, great effects and worthwhile action. The cinematography is decent but not overly the best, but it does add to the films nostalgic feel This film goes on to spawn two sequels and an spin off, but this is by far the best and most enjoyable of them all. Not really having aged in the past 15 years this film is def worth a view if you've never seen it. Basing it off the old Karloff film as an inspiration this film ushered in a resurgence of old monster myths. This film has an nostalgic feel to it as though it were filmed in the 30s or 40s which this reviewer believes was its intended notion. With a nice blend of action, suspense and humor, this film is one that must be viewed by any classic monster film fan, action film fans and fans of pure cinema.",7,0,0,26 January 2014
X-Men," A war is brewing....
","In a world where mutants exists and humankind fears them. A group of mutants led by Charles Xavier must protect those that fear there kind. Enter Logan, dubbed the Wolverine, a mutant who does not know his past, and is enticed to join this group in order to help oppose a dangerous group of mutants led by Magneto, a dangerous mutant with the power to control any and all metals. Magneto believes a war is brewing and begins the first strike against humanity. It is up to Xavier and his group dubbed the X-Men to put a stop to his nefarious plans.Based on the MARVEL comic, this film the first of several X-Men films is a fine introductory look into the world of X-Men. Engaging characters, interesting villains, and a entertaining plot. Some might consider this a pure popcorn film with mindless action and to those criticisms I say look deeper within the context of the film and you will discover there are several allegories within the context of the story, at its heart it is a tale about hatred and misunderstanding from those that our different than us. It is in this film that Hugh Jackman becomes a household name, his portrayal of the tortured and animal-istic Wolverine is truly the bread and butter of the film. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen have wonderful chemistry as friends turned foes. Singer's direction and pacing of the film are top notch and X-Men is a pure cinematic pleasure, that more then comic book fans can get behind and enjoy.",7,0,1,30 December 2013
The Terminator," I'll be back!!
","In the post apocalyptic future of 2029, a war is being fought, a war between humans and the machines. With time running out for the machines they send back into the past one of its most devastating killers, a cyborg posed to look like a human, the Terminator. It has been sent to eliminate Sarah Connor, matriarch to the leader of the human resistance, but the resistance has managed to send back a protector for Sarah. Only time will tell who will reach her first....A fantastic action movie, original in concept and one of Arnold's most iconic roles. The Terminator is fast paced, expertly directed which will entice and suck the viewer in from the first five mins of the film. This film I believe was what launched Arnold into movie stardom as well as Cameron who would both see continued success after this film. The Terminator was far from done as this film would spawn 3 sequels and an eventual fourth in years to come from now. An instant fan favorite, everything about this film is done right, the effects though aged were top notch of the time of its release, the action still gritty and in your face. The story though clichéd at certain instances, still has enough originality to make it special and something more than a simple action movie. The score fits perfectly within the mold of the film. The Terminator is a must see for film buffs as it is now considered a classic among the action film genre.",8,0,0,25 December 2013
Alien," Mother???
","Deep in space, the commercial vessel the Nostromo receives an emergency distress signal from an unexplored planet. After having arrived and conducted a search for survivors the crew returns home only to discover in the most terrifying of ways that a deadly and seemingly invincible bio-form has joined them, and is slowly hunting them one by one.Terrifyingly claustrophobic is a brilliant way to describe this movie. The tension escalates as the movie plays its course. The pacing is brilliant from master filmmaker Ridley Scott. Sigourney Weaver in her most iconic role does a brilliant job portraying Ripley. The feeling of being closed off, the feeling of the Nostromo being a giant claustrophobic maze in which the viewer desperately wishes to escape make this one of the greatest and most terrifying films of its generation. With shocking surprises and twists throughout including the iconic dinner scene that still to this day can be shocking for a first time viewer. The score of the fim only adds to the tension and seemingly silent but deadly tension that continues to mount as the film plays on, only at its conclusion does the viewer finally feel as though they may take a deep breath. Spawning 3 sequels, 2 cross over films, and a loosely tied prequel, Alien has proved to not only resonate these many years later but maintain its popularity within the mytho's of classic American cinema.",8,3,5,25 December 2013
American Hustle," You work for me now!!
","Brilliant con man Irving Rosenfield and his alluring partner in the con, Sydney Prosser are forced to work with FBI agent Richie DiMaso in a high stakes con that eventually involves New Jersey power brokers, U.S. politicians and the mob. Loyalties are tested as the lines blur between control and chaos, where the con eventually becomes the only reality that they can trust...Gripping in its semi true story, you will find yourself watching as these characters spiral into a world of chaos. Brilliantly acted by Bale and company you slowly become to realize that you are watching some of Hollywood's best actors today. Though this movie of crime, cons and passions is slow at first, it eventually picks up steam. Director David O. Russell holds nothing back and neither do his actors. Transported to New York/ New Jersey of the 70's the sound track brilliantly authenticates this movie, and serves as a perfect companion to the film. The set pieces, the wardrobe even the grittiness of the film itself reminds one of a movie straight out of the 70's Alluring and sexually charged in certain scenes as well as good points of humor to ease the tension. Not a full drama, and not a full comedy but a blend of both that delivers, not the best movie I've seen but indeed on that is worthy of the praise it receives.",7,1,5,25 December 2013

The Thing," It rips through your clothes...
","Deep in Antarctica a team of U.S scientists stumble upon an alien entity that can change it's physical form with those that it kills and assimilates. Terror and tension run high as the scientists band together to survive but the question remains who is truly who they are and who can be trusted?For its time The Thing was a grotesque and supremely frightening film. Its effects though seemingly aged are still terrifying for those who have not seen or do not know what to expect with this film. The feeling of isolation and suffocation grow with each passing min. of the film. The score of this film compliments that very real feeling of dread and suspense. Kurt Russell one of John Carpenters favorite cast-able actors does a terrific job as R.J. McReady, who seems to be the only one prepared for the terror that is The Thing. The fellow cast mates do a terrific job as well. Though some may argue that the effects have aged and what was once frightening now cheesy, but with a bit of suspended belief one can truly feel and see the films intention, to scare the hell out of you. Graphic and grotesque in its nature, and all done with physical effects which to me resonate a lot of charm and make the film a bit more real than just the standard CGI of today's film making techniques. The Thing is a must see for any fan of horror and sci-fi, if you can stomach it.",8,1,3,25 December 2013
The Shining," Redrum....
","Jack Torrence is a family man haunted by his past and his inner demons, so when the opportunity arrives to become the winter caretaker for the beautiful yet ominous Overlook Hotel, it gleams a chance to bring his family back together again and work on his long overdue novel, but dark forces await Jack within the Overlook and only his son, who harness's a unique ability may withstand the horror that awaits them all.Originally written by the master of horror Stephen King, Stanley Kubrick directs this powerfully haunting adaptation of the novel. With mesmerizing appeal and a intense story that refuses to let you go until the very last second of film. A slow intense build up will slowly wind up the viewer with each and every turn revealing more of the horror within the haunted hotel itself. One of the all the time greatest in haunting movies, The Shining is a classic for any generation of film goer and one in which will stay with you ;ong after the credits have rolled. If you haven't seen this film than i HIGHLY suggest a viewing......",8,0,1,22 December 2013
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," I respect them so much that I completely stay away from them....
","Andy, a nerdy but good heart'ed man lets his secret slip that hes never done the deed. After meeting a single mother, chances are in his favor if he can overcome his own set of misfortunes and the less the savory advice from his friends.Hilarious, crude and brash make this film one of the funniest comedies to come out in recent times. The chemistry between the principal character as well as the witty yet crass dialog make this adult orientated film a must see for any fan of crude humor. The film that put Seth Rogan on the map and the film that strengthened Steve Carell as a go to guy for comedic films. The direction is smart as is the pacing and humorous feel to this film. A must see for any fan of crass humor with a heart at its core. A film that many film goers and fans have seen and regarded in due respect as a fine comedic film. One of Carell's funniest and one in which gets better with multiple viewings. I highly suggest this film to anyone who likes to laugh, be it slightly low brow.",7,1,2,26 January 2014
Spider-Man," You think you know the story...
","Peter Parker, an intelligent but awkward teenager's life is forever changed after he is bitten by a genetically altered spider, giving him spider like super powers. Peter learns that with great power comes great responsibility as he must fight evil as a superhero after tragedy strikes within his family.Based on the MARVEL comic, many people consider this a fantastic film, and why i do agree up to a point, certain aspects of the film fall short with me. The action is superb but much is left to be desired with some of the over the top hokey dialog and cheesiness throughout the film. Now granted there is a good bit of this film that is extremely enjoyable, the pacing of the film is well and most of the acting is decent, personally i believe Tobey Maguire is a perfect Peter Parker but a let down as Spider-Man. Let be known that as a child I grew up reading Spider-Man as he was my favorite MARVEL comic book other than Captain America, so the character holds special relevance to me. Now I'am not saying this is a bad film, not at all, but certain aspects of the film left me flat and I felt as though much more could be perfected and achieved through this film. Now granted compared to its eventual sequels this is by the far best of Raimi's Spider-man trilogy, but not the best comic book film. Enjoyable action sequences, a true to form story and with a decent pacing within the film. The biggest drawbacks are in its acting and in its dialog throughout. Spider-Man is an enjoyable film, just not the best.",7,0,1,3 January 2014
Alien vs. Predator," AvP half as bad as feared
","OK first to before I spout one word and the bashing of no talent hacks such as Paul 'wish I has a clue' Anderson, a warning: *********SPOILERS*****************Now let the tirade began . . . The Alien franchise as well as the Predator franchise(BTW, for the moron who said Predator wasn't a franchise, any film which inspired comic's, video-game's, Novels and countless legions of fans, constitutes as a franchise.)is probably one of the highest regarded icons of Sci-Fi/Horror cinema. These two film icon's became a part of modern pulp culter and was often times parodied (ala Spaceballs). I'm an avid movie fan, have been since I was a young child. I own a impressive DVD/VHS collection which has taken me 15 years to get it to the point of where it is today. I own every Alien film as well as both Predator film's, and have seen them enough times to know what I know about each is respective universe. These films are one of the main reason's why its so great to love film.Each film in its own right has as one member above has posted had a unique and original blend of flavor, thrills, story, and plot. All why staying true to the original formula that made each successor great. True that not all of the films throughout the Alien and Predator franchise's have been the best but each deserving to be a part of the franchise. With that saidAVP DOES NOTAfter seeing the film today on its opening day I was filled with a mix of dread and a mix of anguish and heartbreak as I walked out of the theater. How could anyone in their right mind make a complete joke out of an iconic staple in film history and than the answer dawned on me as fast as the question. MONEY!!!!20th Century Fox wanted something made and targeted for a general audience at the same time playing on the fact that all the hardcore fanboys and normal fans would turn out. Even though we all know it should be rated R like all SIX other films in the series. To 20th Century Fox I say this. May you choke on every single damn cent you rob for RAPING AND KILLING two beloved franchises in cinema history (ala George Lucas)What starts out with a lackluster back story and ends with one of the biggest damn slaps in ANY FANS FACE EVER! The Story: Charles Bishop Weyland, Multi - Billionaire (and thats as much as we pretty much our told about him, other then the fact that his health ain't so good) played by Lance Henrikson discovers through his satellite system's a underground pyramid 2'000 feet below the surface somewhere over in Antartica,through heat signature's so on begans the assimilation of a team to treak and discover this long lost Pyramid. The teams assembled is Heli'd off to a ice breaker class frigate and on its way to the mystery. I'm not going to get into the acting being that it was a Sci-Fi flick i didn't think the acting was going to be spectacular but compared to this I've seen better acting in Killer Klowns from Outer Space.Anyways our humans get to the site, after a few more mins of why were going there and why Alexa Woods or LEX thinks its a BAD IDEA, anyways it doesn't take much to talk her into going. Soon after things attempt to get going and without spoiling too much of this trash, The Predators return to their Pyramid for the 100 year coming of Age ritual for three teenage Predator's which involves the awaking of a hibernating queen, Once things take off the action scene's comense one after another in garbled quick cuts and watered down action I thought i was watching WWE at one point. 87 mins isn't a lot of time to set up much of anything be it story, character development or whatever.I understand the speeding up of the Alien lifecycle for story point or the lack OF. But to kill off not one BUT TWO Predators in such a weak fashion and as quickly as they did annoyed me. But the thing that pissed me off and turned me the most sour were the three but very IMPORTANT THINGS.1) The second I saw 'Scar' (Predator) and Lex join forces I had to put my head in my hands and sigh. To make something that inane happen and rip apart the storied lore that so many filmmakers spent to make Predator what it was was ripped apart and blow into a thousand different directions as soon as Scar and Lex ran side by side from the oncoming explosion GIVE ME A G**DAMN BREAK. This is AVP not *&^%^*ing Predator and PALS. I understand the sense of Respect and what it takes to get it amongst the Predator cultures as showed in the films and the books and I'm sure it would take more than some stupid twit icing not ONE but TWO Aliens, which I found stupid considering the fact that Two Predator's were bested so easily BY ONE ALIEN.2) Rating this PG-13 in the first place, I knew from the get go what this was going to do. TRUE, Blood and Gore don't make the story, But if those two original elements played a reacurring role in all SIX other films than YOU DON'T TAKE IT OUT. If the damn things not broke don't TRY TO FIX IT.3) and most important of all, Paul Anderson, a HACK of a director, who if someone competent was running 20th Century Fox, would never EVER have been ALLOWED near the script or direction or anything remotely to do with the film other than selling AvP merchandise at a theater in L.A. somewhere. With a Track record such as his: Event Horizon: A mediocre film with poor directionMortalk Kombat: HAHAHAHAH I don't even need to speak on this oneSoldier: See above PostResident Evil: He did the same thing to AvP with this one for me, I'm a huge fan of the games Afetr i saw this one I really hated Anderson.It makes me sick that he wrote Resident Evil: Apocalypse so I expect much of the same pointless crap.To sum it all up, this movie could have been made with the exact same story without Alien's or Predator's and youd truly see it for what it was a poorly written, poorly conceived, poorly directed film. The only saving grace of the entire thing was it used Aliens and Predator's without them as I've said Anderson wouldve had nothing but his stupid lame STORY",5,0,0,13 August 2004
Batman Begins," The epitome of Batman on film
","After 8 years, 2 sequels and several viewing I have come to the conclusion that this is beyond the best of the best for Batman films. The true spirit of Bruce Wayne and his crime fighting alter ego Batman are captured and displayed by Christian Bale, David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan.Dark, gritty and realistic make this origin story one of the best in comic book movie history and IMO the greatest of all Batman movies. A perfect mix of action, character development and story help to breath life once again into the iconic character. Set in the sprawling, decayed and ultimately corrupt city of Gotham, tells the story of a child's loss and the man's extraordinary journey in becoming something more than just a man, something more than a tool but a symbol, an ideal and hope in order to perhaps one day cleanse the city of its crime ridden woes that helped create its greatest defender.This movie is a must see for any comic book fan, any action movie fan, and any fan of pure cinema",9,0,1,17 June 2013
Twilight," enjoyable.... if your a adolescent girl
","A seemingly normal but shy teenage girl discovers that vampires exists and falls in love with one only to realize there is more at stake for her affection than she is aware of.Horribly clichéd with terrible acting and a dull and senseless script. When one conveys emotion through the same facial expression throughout not only this film, but every single one to follow. This film while hugely popular has its niche audience in young adolescence girls. Much of this film is left to be desired, the effects seem mediocre as does most of the film, undeserved of the attention and mindless praise it gets. A different spin on the vampire mythos that detracts from the true definition of what they are supposed to be, having gone on to spawn several less then impressive sequels, i find that these films have its built in audience and largely is not impressive in its clichéd story, bad acting, horrible direction and overly cheesy dialog. If your under the age of 17 then this is indeed the film for you. For true lovers of vampire films id suggest a dozen others that not only stay true to the mythos of the vampire but do so in a more professional manner.",1,6,9,26 January 2014
Saving Private Ryan," Earn this....
","Is the mission worth the man? This question must be answered by Captain John Miller, as he takes his fellow platoon of soldiers deep behind German fortifications in occupied France. Following the infamous D-Day invasion Captain Miller and his men must traverse the dangerous Nazi infested countryside to find Private James Ryan, so that he may return home among the chaos that is war.Not only one of the finest war movies ever crafted, but one of the finest human dramas ever filmed. Through the backdrop of World War II, Spielberg delivers us right into the action, suspense and heart felt drama. Filmed in a guerrilla style like approach helps to enhance the realism of this film. Perfectly acted by Hanks and company, one will find themselves immersed and truly caring for these characters as the film plays on. Said to have made veterans weep during its release and during its intense first thirty mins, as its depiction of the events of D-Day upon the beaches of Normandy to be the most realistic and finest ever captured on film. The world of war torn Europe and the brave men who fought there is brought to life with not only the masterful direction of Spielberg, but with the haunting and heroic score by John Williams. Hanks delivers one of his finest performances, and this movie is one of the finest to ever have been made.",10,2,3,22 December 2013
JFK," To sin with silence.....
","November 22nd, 1963, Dallas, a day that will live in history, a day in which Camelot ended. John F. Kennedy was assassinated by supposed lone gunmen and nut Lee Harvey Oswald. As the country mourns its fallen president, and as the the power structure of the country begins to rapidly change, one man, District Attorney Jim Garrison begins to unravel a mystery and conspiracy that points to the highest echelons of power within the United States government.A gripping story shrouded in fact and fiction, takes its viewer on a journey into 1960's America, where not all the questions are or can be answered but one feels while watching this that their is indeed more to the official story that was fed to the people of the world. A fantastic crime thriller, with memorable performances by its ensemble cast. Stone manages to recreate the feeling of uncertainty and fear as the world believes in its leaders and where one man questions not only the official response but the very fabric of the power structure of this country. While watching this film one may feel the pressure and tension increasing as was intended by Stone and company. Masterfully scored by legendary composer John Williams adds to the dramatic feeling of lost honor and shadowy intentions that perhaps our countries leaders at the time conveyed. Though historically skewed in certain areas it still reaches and makes its point, that whatever happened in that fateful day and time afterward wasn't as it seemed. Critically acclaimed for a reason, this is one of Stone's finest works and is not a only a must watch for any film goer but any history buff as well.",9,3,10,22 December 2013
The Incredibles," Simply Incredible
","A family of super heroes, enjoying the quite suburban life must once again fight the world of villainy and crime within there world, this time to not just save there world, but there family.In my opinion this is the best of the Pixar films and one of the best animated movies through Disney to be made in a very long time. Now I'm not an avid Disney or Pixar watcher but this film I did enjoy very much. Great blend of comedic action as well as a decent script that can appeal to adults as well as kids alike. With most animated films the actors can only do their job through a voice over and the principal actors in this film do an excellent job. Simple in its story and in its pacing anyone an follow this film, but what truly makes it stand above the rest is its scope and how easily it engrosses the viewer. By far this is one of the best Pixar films and one i can easily recommend to adults as there are several point brought up in this film that will easily engross and become relate able to its adult audiences.",7,0,0,3 January 2014
Ghostbusters," Who ya gonna call??
","Three unemployed parapsychologists set up a business in New York City as a unique ghost removal service.A hilarious and ground breaking film that has not only stood the test of time but still resonates firmly with many viewers to this day. A classic comedy film with a bit of horror and action elements to it. Bill Murray and cast does a wonderful job portraying there characters. This film spawned a sequel and many fans clamor for another. The story is original, and the pacing follows suit, the dead pan and dry wit comedy of the film makes this film not only charming but a great comedy with an original concept. I highly recommend this film and one of my favorite films of all time. Crossing several different genres, from comedy, horror and action this film has a little bit of everything for everyone. A film that can be enjoyed by children to adults alike. This film will fill you with laughter as well as some instances will add to the tension of the supernatural story.",9,2,3,26 January 2014
The Evil Dead," Necronomicon Ex Mortus
","Five friends head to an isolated cabin in the woods, where they unknowingly discover a book that releases evil demons that possess the living. Who, if anyone can survive the night or the evil dead?A cult classic within the horror genre, this brutal, grotesque and raw film is a must see for any fans of the genre. A classic film that has inspired many other horror directors of the genre and gone on to inspire two sequels and a remake. The acting is not the best and in fact is a bit mediocre, though this film did make Bruce Campbell a star and one of Sam Raimi's favorite cast able actors. The pacing is wonderful, the camera work as well, the acting and dialog though can be considered cheesy in some aspects but it is still decent film. One must understand that this film though many consider a B-film was and in fact an extremely terrifying film for first time viewers. Some may consider it cheesy now compared to the effects ridden horror films of the present, but to this viewer, I personally find this to be an enjoyable horrifying film. The effects all practical add to the grotesque realism. Though while the film starts slow it eventually build up steam to an almost unbearable breaking point of horror. The original Evil Dead is a must see for anyone who considers themselves a true horror film aficionado. Though not for the faint of heart whatsoever.",7,1,2,26 January 2014
Paranormal Activity," Nothing scary here
","A newlywed couple after moving into there suburban bliss, become increasingly terrified and haunted by the demonic presence within there home.What has become known as the found footage genre, is a cheap and sometimes effective way of telling a story in a different light. Some classics of the genre include The Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield and Chronicle just to name a few. This film fails in every aspect to do anything but bore the viewer. Not scary in any way at least to this reviewer, granted the concept with in which this film is presented is unique but there is nothing about this film terrifying or even hair raising. Now there are some out there who find this film to be scary and to them I suggest that they must not truly have seen any other horror films. Cheap jump scares and thats about all you will find within this film. The acting is what i expect from amateurs, the direction lazy and the pacing while yes attempts to build tension does very little. The best point in this film is the very last 2 to 3 minutes, other than that there's not much else i can say about this film other than the fact that it has spawned 3 sequels, an upcoming spin off, and another sequel completely dumbfounds me.",3,1,2,3 January 2014

","The new owner of the Cleveland Indians has a plan, she wants her team to do so horrible that she can move them to Miami. Purposely putting together the worst team and players she can find. Enter Jake Taylor, aged catcher and veteran, Rick 'Wild Thing' Vaughn, reckless pitcher and young upstart, and Willie 'Say Hey' Mays, a fast as lightning nobody with something to prove. Along with a group of misfits they discover that the only way to save their team is to win the whole thing...This film is simply genius and one of my favorite comedies of all time. Though you might not be a huge sports or baseball fan but this film has a little bit of everything. Senseless comedy, romance, action (sport- wise), and most importantly a lot of heart. The characters, though a group of misfits and oddballs are extremely likable and the chemistry between them is wonderful. Charlie Sheen does a wonderful job as does Wesley Snipes in one his earliest roles, James Gammon will have you in stitches as manager Lou Brown. You will become attached to the characters plight and maybe find yourself rooting for the Indians in real life, after having viewed this film. Spawning two sequels, though less popular and less entertaining then the original, Major League will have you laughing and rooting throughout the entire film.",9,1,3,26 December 2013

A fight in which Rocky strives to not win but to just go the distance.A true underdog story at its heart with tremendous performance that will tug at your heart strings and hit your emotions in a wave of pure entertainment.

The score is a wonderful addition to the movie that truly carries the soul of the film. Carl Weathers is a pure pleasure to watch as he takes on his finest role of his career.

","Harry Potter, a seemingly normal 11 year old boy soon discovers that there is far more to the world and himself then he ever imagined. Famous for an incident at his birth he soon discovers the world of magic as he is invited and attends Hogwarts, a school for witchcraft and wizardry. While there he learns that not all wizards are those to be trusted and there are those still serve an old evil, an old evil that wants Harry Potter dead.Based off the acclaimed series by J.K. Rowling, Chris Columbus directs the first of the series. Touching, heartfelt and innocent is one way to describe the first of the series, lighthearted in its enjoyment and in its scope, one feels after watching this film that they've barely scraped the surface of the world of magic and muggles and one would be right in making that assessment. John Williams scores the film beautifully and the entire score itself feels like a part of the magic that is this film. The child actors mainly Radcliffe, Grint and Watson do a marvelous job and the chemistry between the three cant be denied by the viewer at at any point. Alan Rickman, who plays the sinister Snape is wonderful in his role and is easily one of the many who do a wonderful job within the film. The late Richard Harris also does a magnificent job as does Maggie Smith. One cant help but be inexplicably drawn to the film, it almost feels as though you are let in on a secret, one in which you are glad to be a part of. While some would argue that the first of the series is perhaps a bit to childish in its nature, i disagree and say it is the most care free of the series, a good introduction piece into a series that only gets darker and more adult as they go. For any fan of fantasy, or any fan of film in general the first Harry Potter film is a true gem and one I'm glad to have watched.",8,1,2,30 December 2013

Enter Norman Bates a man with a devious side to him who is controlled by his domineering mother.One of the most classic and shocking films for its time, and directed by the master of suspense. Hitchcock to this day is still considered one of the greatest film directors of all time and it is easily believable as you watch his direction through photography, lighting and pacing. Psycho is one if not his most revered film. The pacing and the tension grow with each passing minute and for the first time viewer one truly has no idea what to expect, other than the growing feeling that something isn't right. Shocking for its time, and with a twist ending that in this day and age may be easy to figure out but for its time truly took the viewer for a surprise.

At one point in every persons life they fear whats in the water around them and this film is that reason. Superb acting and pacing that not only terrifies the audience but slowly builds the tension of this film and delivers at its conclusion. The shark is not show for a large portion of the film and for good reason as it helps to build the pay off when it is finally shown. The soundtrack and Jaws theme is one of the most memorable to ever grace a film, and is composed by the master John Williams. Everything about this film is wonderful and it rightly deserves its place as a classic among cinema.

Only to stalk and torment a babysitter and her friendsA cult classic and the film that started the slasher craze that would inspire future films such as Friday the 13th and A nightmare on Elm Street.

De Niro once again proves why once again he is one of the finest actors of his generation. The chemistry between Pesci, De Niro and Liotta is off the scale. The concept and pacing of the story is wonderful and one of the finest films i can recommend. Violent, yes but its necessary to the story. Lorraine Bracco plays her role brilliantly and brings a certain east coast charm. The feeling of being out of control grows with the viewer as you watch its principal character spiral into welcomed chaos and violence. I find Goodfellas to be one of Scorsese's finest films and any fan of cinema needs to make it a point to witness this film.

The story, based on the acclaimed novel by Micheal Crichton is fantastic and comes down to the moral question of science versus nature. The acting is great as is the pacing of the film.
