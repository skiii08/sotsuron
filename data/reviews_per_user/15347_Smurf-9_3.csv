Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Nice... if you like video games
","I viewed this movie as kind of a 50 / 50 thing.  I liked the story and the characters but....  everything just looked so 'flat' it severely lacked depth much like a video game.  It IS NOT a movie... it IS a video game.  I for one am getting very sick of all the C.G.I. junk out there, it just plain stinks.  I want to see real movies! I realize that obviously space movies need to use this element but in this case it is over-used.",1,1,2,3 July 1999
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Excellent... The best action / fantasy film
","I absolutely loved this film. It sucked you in right from the beginning and held you to the very end(make sure wait through the screen credits). The(real)photography was beautiful with stunning locations. The CG was some of the best I've seen. This film is often bright and pleasing to the eye unlike many others. Special effects?? awesome! The sets / ships were proof of the attention to detail of the art and construction departments. The story and the way it was acted out just couldn't have been better. It was exciting, maybe a little scary for the little ones and often times very funny. I can't imagine the amount of research involved putting this all together.",10,417,818,21 May 2007
Van Helsing," The look of a video game
",I was looking forward to seeing this movie. The thought of all the great monsters(together)and the ultimate good guy sounded like it would be good. I was wrong.The film was not only full of holes but had the flat no depth look of a video game through-out. I am tired of computed generated films. I want to see as much 'real' as possible and not be short changed. All the unnatural moves and absolutely impossible things do nothing to make the hero look like a human.Whatever happened to cinematography? I'd like to see a return of realism to the movies. If I want to see a video game I'll fire up the X-Box.,1,0,2,16 May 2004
