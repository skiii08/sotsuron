The King's Speech," overrated
","The french critics of the New Wave said that 'british' an 'cinema' were incompatible words. This welll written, brilliantly acted film supports this assertion. The dialogue is intelligent, the acting is excellent, the formidable Colin Firth deserves the Oscar and, ¿why not Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter? (yes, I know that Christian Bale and Melissa Leo are the favorites). But: ¿Best film? ¿Best direction?. There are more cinema in one frame of 'Shutter Island', 'Inception' or 'Hereafter' that in all the work of Hooper. And Chris Nolan, Martin Scorsese (the scandal of the year) and Clint Eastwood (this admits more discussion) aren't nominated.",7,3,7,22 February 2011
