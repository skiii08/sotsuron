The Devil's Advocate," Too realistic
",Something about this film was too realistic. Al Pachino was sooo bad. Lucifer is so real that it's not acting. it is what it is. It felt like he was sitting on the end of my bed every time he appeared. Most horror films are designed for the viewer to watch from afar. You might feel like you are in the film and get the scares but not that the demons are trying to touch you personally. Lucifer and the demon women are directed towards the audience much of the time. It's like he is trying to show you personally how he wants to take Keanu while he is doing sex with you. I expected a bit more distance. The Godfather was an angel compared to this.,6,0,1,1 June 2014
The Evil Dead," Pathetic!
",Oh dear!Nobody will like this movie who has any common sense. Not scary. There are much better movies from this era so there is no excuse for it.Worst film I have ever seen. The acting and the gore are of poor quality - a homemade movie at best.This is not for real.The idea of some of the gory scenes is good if it looked real - the artwork is good for a school project perhaps - good for those who don't know how to make films.,1,1,6,9 February 2016
