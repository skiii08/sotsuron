Catch Me If You Can," Don't read if the truth offends you
","This movie was OK. It wasn't spectacular and was on the overlong side. That's really not what you would expect from a big name film with big name stars. I guess I got about what I wanted from it, but to say that it's as wonderful as what I'm reading here is just not accurate. First off, you know you're in trouble when Leonardo Di Caprio is the best actor in the movie. I'm not a fan, but he did do the best job. I like Tom Hanks, how could you not? However, his acting talents are incredibly overestimated. For the first 20 minutes I was having a hard time trying to figure out what his accent was- southern, East Coast or perhaps Australian? Weak. Next, there's the infamous Christopher Walken. Amazing how no one mentioned him in the 20 or so comments I read. Maybe they didn't want to say anything bad about someone so well liked. OK, leave it to me to do the dirty work. Once again I'll bash another extremely popular actor: Walken is a terrible actor and in this movie he actually was a little better than I've seen him- slightly less terrible. I also read that this was totally original and that the 'cat and mouse' idea was just great. This film didn't have an original feel to me and just off the top of my head I'm coming up with 2 other chase movies that blow this one away: Heat (De Niro) and The French Connection. Sorry to have to burst everyone's ideas, but I can't lie to you. I must also do the unthinkable again; yes, I'm going to say a few words about Spielberg. He has some talent, but his movies are filled with a certain sappy quality that just doesn't ring true or have any relevance. Perfect example- that thing with the floating $ bill that someone said was a nod to Forrest Gump (a forgettable movie to be sure). I guess people like that sort of stuff, but it's just silly and overdone. Well, I think I've ranted enough. I just feel there are many other better movies to get excited about out there. For Tom Hanks fans I still say 'Big' (1987) is his best. For Spielberg I strongly recommend his first and best effort 'Duel' (1971). For Walken and Di Caprio fans- you don't want to hear what I recommend.",6,0,3,27 September 2004
Sleepy Hollow," Sorry people- this one sucked!
","After reading many positive comments and only one negative I found myself just having to let people know how poor this movie was. Basically just a fancy, dressed up slasher movie this ghastly film is disturbing in a way that surprised me. I have not read Washington Irving's story, but I can't imagine that it was meant to be just a brainless gore fest with one head after another gruesomely chopped off. I thought the acting was mediocre and Depp's performance was quite odd. Yes, the visual style was appealing, which is why I gave this movie a 3 instead of a 1. Watch this one if you're up for a disgusting mess that is only marginally funny at times.",3,2,5,27 July 2000
Cross of Iron," I don't think a hot shower and paxil is going to help....
","I don't think I'll be able to forget this vile 'film.' Easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen, I'm absolutely stunned at the rave reviews and high rating it has on this wonderful site. Usually the reviewers get it mostly right, but here is a good example of how nothing is perfect. I don't know where to start criticizing this piece of trash. With a cast that includes some of my favorites I was expecting an interesting experience and was punished with a nightmare mess of a movie. I felt so sorry for James Mason as I couldn't figure out what accent he was trying. Maximillian Schell is awesome, but here I actually laughed out loud twice which could not have been the intention of the writer or director. I could only understand about 20% of what David Warner was saying and James Coburn was supposed to be the star I guess and had about 12 sentences of dialogue. He also had a totally unintelligible scene with some woman, maybe a nurse? I had to really stretch to find a reason to give it a 2 instead of a 1. A couple decent lines and battle sequences is about it here. I kept waiting for it to get better, but amazingly enough it got worse towards the end! If you have to see every movie ever made, then go for it. Otherwise, there has to be a better choice out there somewhere.",2,4,11,14 July 2015
The Princess Bride," I think I saw the wrong film!
","I just finished watching this movie on DVD after a friend strongly recommended it. Not having ever heard of it before I didn't have much in the way of expectations so it's hard to believe I was let down. Actually I was shocked at how mediocre this movie is! I went up and down the user comments and can only conclude that I must have seen the wrong movie. Sure, there were cute and funny bits along the way but for the most part this was purely for little kids. I was honestly embarrassed during almost the whole thing. This movie couldn't really decide whether it was a farcical comedy, an adventure story or a medieval saga. The only thing I felt when Peter Falk put away the book was relief that it was over and so was the awkwardness.",4,12,36,17 November 2000
Driven," not good, but easy to watch
","This movie falls into that category of films that are bad but just a little bit fun to watch and not boring. I was surprised to see that Oliver Stone didn't direct this because it's almost exactly like Any Given Sunday. I'm not sure why anyone would want to make a movie in the style of Stone, but maybe some people like that kind of stuff. It's also a lot like Days of Thunder with a hot young driver and the older teachers. Some of the actors even look like people from that movie! So, basically, if you've seen these movies there's not much point in watching this one unless you're into action and there are some good racing scenes. Another plus for guys is going to be the countless t&a shots. I thought the women were not that great looking actually, and much preferred seeing Gina Gershon who is not only extremely hot, but gives pretty much the best performance here. That I think tells you something about this movie! One other note: Stallone was really not bad in this contrary to what I've heard so far here. 5 out of 10.",5,0,0,28 December 2001
Pulp Fiction," The first negative comment
","No, this film did not repulse me as much as reservoir dogs did. That's among the best things I can say about this movie. The fact that so many people seem to love it so much is actually frightening to me. I just can't seem to understand the desire to see this director's shock value material. What is the fascination with seeing ears cut off or needles jammed into people? I sat through it and must admit there were some positive things worthy of note. I did laugh at some scenes and John Travolta's performance was his only good one since the 70s. My 3 pts out of 10 are for: 1)Samuel Jackson with the hamburger 2)the absolutely ridiculous story by Christopher Walken and 3) the absurdity of Keitel coming in to clean up the mess. All in all, excrutiating, but as I say a step up from the first film by Tarantino.",3,10,21,8 January 2000
Blade Runner," No, it really isn't a good movie
","I watched the movie as a teenager not long after it first came out and remember being disappointed. I got a hold of the dvd and so I checked it out, wondering if I my opinion would change at this point. The answer is no, it wouldn't. Yes, visually it is awesome. I even liked the music so much I went out and bought the cd. However, the movie itself is still disappointing. I actually had a hard time sitting through it. The story had some really good things going for it, but because of the extremely dark tone and the slow pace I found it somewhat nauseating- especially the graphic bits with eyeballs. Many people seem to like this one so it may be worth your taking a look even if just for the look of this film. As a total movie, if you like dreary, non-moving works, you may well think of it as a masterpiece.",3,4,14,5 June 1999
Trainspotting," Not quite bad enough to turn off, but very close
","I always feel compelled to write something when I seem to be differ completely with the views stated here. I guess I'm the only one in the world who didn't love this movie- in fact I thought it was awful. I gave it a 3 based on a few funny parts and for the effort of the cast. Apart from that it oscillated from sickening to bizarre with little or no redeeming qualities. No, it wasn't just because some guy stuck his head in a toilet that made me want to turn this movie off. There were several scenes that just were plain offensive as they were there merely for shock value as in Reservoir Dogs- another disgusting 90s mess. I give just about every movie a chance and I stayed with this one 'til the end, but if your tastes are anything like mine and you're not a glutton for punishment I strongly suggest that you avoid this one or turn it off after the toilet scene.",3,10,30,27 February 2003
