Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Not impressed.
","Oh dear. Having thought that the first Volume was tripe I didn't hold up much for this. The dialog was so unengaging as to mystify me as to why it takes up vast swathes of this film. Action there was little which is no bad thing judging by the comedic and poor fight scenes from the first film. A complete mess of a movie which swaps chronography around for no reason whatsoever, has characters I presume you are supposed to relate to, but have no hope in doing (unless you are perhaps and assassin). I would have thought that in a revenge movie empathising with the lead character would be a pre-requisite, but not here. Therefore you don't care what Uma does, in fact I wish she'd never woken up from her coma. The end was as awful as they come. Could easily have been done as one film, but should have been less than that.",Null,0,1,21 September 2004
Alien 3," The Best Movie of the Series (just)
","Firstly if you have only seen the theatrical release of this then I urge you to see the Directors cut. It adds a lot more to the film in terms of characters and even has a different host for the Alien.The opening to the movie is a visual treat. It shows of the bleak setting wonderfully and I wonder why it wasn't included in the actual release. It also reaffirms what I thought about the theatre release, that this isn't a film about the Alien. In fact an early script would have had no Alien appearing at all. It delves into the psyche of murderers and rapists who are left to rot on a planet with only god to guide. The sense of isolation and meagre existence led by the prisoners captivated me. The Alien is the devil of the film come to grab them back to their previous lives of 'evil'.The acting is first class, and probably the best of any sci-fi I can think of. Reactions to the monster are correct showing genuine fear rather than the masochism shown in Aliens, Resurrection and AVP. This out of all others in the story attempts to show of the loneliness of space exploration and look into the lives of those that inhabit the universe. If you are a fan of sci-fi then this I feel is the best of the bunch.",Null,2,4,26 October 2004
Alien vs. Predator," Alien to the Alien series
","It is an impossible task to please the fans of both these movies, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't have been attempted. No attempt seems to have been made and this is certainly not an Alien movie. The story and structure of the film is a combination of 13 ghosts, Cube, and Stargate. It just so happens that the monsters involved happen to be Aliens and predators. Cliché after cliché is thrust down our throats with out any attempt to disguise that this was written in 5 minutes with no thought or depth. The whole pyramid idea has been done to death so many times before it beggars belief it could be attempted again. The acting is the worst I have seen in any of the films, but then the dialouge was awful so thats hardly surprising. It plays out like a kids movie feeling it needs to explain everything that is happening. The Alien movies were great, you had a real sense of a Universe you wanted to know more about through your own imagination.If you watch this having never seen any of the previous films you would think that this was an enjoyable action film, and that it is. Watching the aliens and Predators fight it out is cool. Sadly if you've seen the previous films (in particular the Alien Trilogy) than this is a severe waste of a license.",5,0,0,26 October 2004
