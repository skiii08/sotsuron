Mission: Impossible III," The first forgettable movie of the series
","Tom Cruise has achieved with this movie to wipe off every trace of the original franchise. This is not Mission Impossible anymore. This is Tom Cruise's ego become into an action movie. A completely forgettable one. Because in MI3 you'll get to see him acting as the average James Bond wannabe which happened to had the luck to have bought the famous and now extinct TV series franchise, just to make his dream come true.If you happen to see this picture in a theater, you better carry great deals of pop corn and cokes, because a couple of days later you'll find you enjoyed them and that you remember them more than the movie itself. I still expect a better action flick for this season.",2,1,3,12 May 2006
War of the Worlds," What is this movie about?
","Extremely disappointing. What was Spielberg thinking of when he decided to make 'another' aliens movie? 'Close Encounters...' didn't have enough violence? 'ET' had too much of a soap opera? Nowadays, if you plan to make a new action/drama picture based on aliens stuff, you need to make sure that you are not going to deceive your audience with a naive argument. Specially if your country is able to wipe off more than once every trace of life on earth without any need of goofy tripods.If Spielberg would've put the movie in the thirties, maybe it would've had a chance to lose some of its goofiness. Because, whether he wanted to speak on peoples' chance to become heroes, he didn't succeed; whether he wanted to establish a milestone in digital effects, he didn't succeed. WOTW in this sense is completely forgettable.Not everything is that bad anyway. Dakota Fanning's had a remarkable chance to demonstrate what the cool child actress she is.",4,1,1,6 January 2006
