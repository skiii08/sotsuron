The Sound of Music," The hills are alive...
","... and so, too, will your heart be, after seeing this perhaps most wonderful of all movie musicals. The music is at the all-time apex of show tunes. Julie Andrews was born to play Maria, the novitiate too much in love with the world. The story is rescued from the cloying by the subplot of opposing and escaping the encroaching Nazi stranglehold on Austria: love, beauty, and harmony survive as witnesses to the right and the good, in a real world run suddenly amok.",10,1,7,23 August 1999
Elizabeth," One Virgin Replaces Another
","`She had such power over men's hearts,' a young Elizabeth I tells her remaining true adviser, Sir Francis Walsingham, nodding toward a statue of the Virgin Mary at whose feet she kneels, and wondering aloud why her own heart has ceased to be touched. Though it is late in the movie `Elizabeth' with Cate Blanchett in the title role, it is early in what would be the monarch's long reign to come.`They have found nothing to replace her,' Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush) replies, nothing to connect their worldly hopes to the sphere of the divine since the English Reformation ended Catholicism as the dominant faith in the realm. Despite the success of a bloody Catholic reaction under Elizabeth's half-sister and predecessor as monarch, Mary Tudor, with hundreds of Protestants burned at the stake, Elizabeth in conscience will sever the whole Church of England from papal authority yet again. But what will take its place, not in canon or conscience, but in the depths of men's hearts?It is now when Elizabeth realizes it must be she. `I have become a virgin,' she announces not long after. She paints her face white and embarks on her long career as the icon an appreciative history would come to call the Virgin Queen.The movie, taking many liberties from the true text of history, chronicles Elizabeth's passage from the uncrowned, gamboling romantic who encouraged the repeated embraces of Lord Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester (Joseph Fiennes), to the severe, chaste monarch revered eternally by English people. During this period in her mid- to late twenties she authorizes much spillage of blood as she gathers authority to her and deals mercilessly with those who would dispute it. The dirty work is Walsingham's; the onus is hers.When it is done, she knows she will never marry for geopolitics, as at first she was pressed to do. More sadly, nor will she do so for love, for her heart is dead, ground away in the forward lurch of history. She will instead sit resignedly and heroically, proxy in heaven for the hearts of her folk.",9,0,0,21 August 1999
Being John Malkovich," Creates, and redeems, a brand new perversion
","Puppeteering, for Craig (John Cusack), is the nearest thing to his heart's desire, getting inside another person's skin to animate his soul. It doesn't pay well, so he file-clerks on floor seven-and-a-half of the world's weirdest office building--everyone on this midget-sized floor has to walk around hunched over at the waist. Craig's wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz) wants a baby but makes do with babying disturbed chimps and other castoff fauna.At the office, Craig lusts after no-nonsense Maxine (Catherine Keener). At the after-office-hours watering hole, when he says he's a frustrated puppeteer, she's like, 'Waiter! Check please!' But after behind a file cabinet he discovers a secret portal into the mind of actor John Malcovich (played by himself)--this is, after all, a fantasy--she senses a business opportunity. They can charge unfulfilled souls $200 to spend 15 minutes in celebrity skin and be spit out safely by the side of the New Jersey Turnpike.No one is keener to try it than Lotte. Somehow she knows it'll be ecstasy, and it is: she immediately wants to become a transsexual. Hearing this, Maxine, cool to Craig but warm to Lotte, has a hot flash which stands her nipples at attention: she'll seduce Malcovich while Lotte is inside him. When Lotte digs it and Craig finds out, Craig locks Lotte in the chimp's cage and, unbeknownst to Maxine and Malcovich, replaces her as the third in a unique ménage à trois.From here, the permutations of identify transfer proliferate to the delight of the viewer, if not always the onscreen characters. The movie creates a brand new form of perversion and then redeems it. Without giving away the ending, it can be revealed that this film extends metaphors of getting inside another person--sex, identity transfer, puppeteering--into unsuspected avenues of redemption and intimations of both novel and traditional versions of immortality.",10,0,1,22 July 2000
Zulu," What it meant to be Christian soldiers ...
",".. which, nominally, they were. At least, they wore red coats and could quote the psalms. There were about 100 of them, plus a contingent of sick and lame in the infirmary at the supply camp at Rourke's Drift, Natal, South Africa, in 1879 when the Zulus rose, 4,000 strong, to wipe out the real army of 1,000 that protected them. They themselves were, on paper, anything but warriors. Cooks, supply masters, singers in the choir, malingerers, only a few of them stiff-upper-lipped soldiers, they were a ragtag bunch. Their foppish, racist commander, Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead (Michael Caine, making his first screen appearance) is there only because he's the son of an officer who was the son of an one who died at Waterloo. Another officer just happens to be on the scene, Lieutenant John Chard (Stanley Baker), but he's an engineer sent to extend the fruits of Her Majesty's largesse by building a bridge. When the whole Zulu nation converges on their skimpy redoubt, can these mostly green noncombatants hope to survive?By the time of the first Zulu onslaught, the patrician Bromhead has shown just enough intelligence to let the smarter Chard deploy the troops and organize the resistance. Meanwhile, the plebeian Chard has had to dig deep within himself to summon courage to match the cool Bromhead's native fortitude. Strange bedfellows, they make a good team. The men respond to them. But, despite their successfully repulsing the Zulus in early stages of the battle, how can they ever last, given their enemy's overwhelming numbers?Their cause is not bolstered by the presence of the Swedish missionary, Reverend Otto Witt (Jack Hawkins), and his prim daughter Margareta (Ulla Jacobsson). Neither see war as consistent with God's will. He, positively unnerved by it, takes to the bottle when he isn't exhorting soldiers to lay down their arms. Chard eventually has to expel them from the camp. The Zulus display their own nobility when they decline to massacre them.The battle at Rourke's Drift rages on. Whatever the outcome, it is clear from the start that this taut, exciting, well-made movie from 1964 celebrates honor, bravery, and male brotherhood above all else ... including God.",9,3,5,25 October 2000
La Grande Illusion," Classic film on the death of ancient regimes
","In the old European order, pre-WWI, one nation's aristocracy made war on another's not out of love for king and country or hatred for the enemy, but out of a sense of honor and duty. War was what they did, these aristocrats of l'ancien regime. Their castles in the air, their noble worldview, their time-honored way--all would crumble, as they very well knew, if the line between the rabble and themselves were allowed to continue to blur. The masses had new and different loyalties.'La Grande Illusion' in 1914 was the hope that that old order could be preserved in the face of surging democracy and noveau-riche power. Jean Renoir's film presents us with an irony: the martial elites of France and Germany needed the war to vouchsafe their very identities, and yet that conflict would prove their undoing. Whatever side won, the hoi polloi would gain the upper hand.Restored from its original camera negative, the 1937 French film now on DVD sparkles like new. The restoration lets us see that nothing is dated about this work of genius, even if its POW-camp situations today seem stock and its characters stereotypes of nationality and class. The fine acting, the deft pacing, and the fluid camerawork make for a film that could have been produced last year. The whispered subtext, the nuanced conflicts, and the ironic complexity make for a film that is timeless.The subtext is the eternal tension between 'in the air' and 'on the ground,' 'on high' and 'here below,' 'from a distance' and 'up close and personal.' From a distance, war is no more rancorous than a chess game, with national boundaries as artificial as the squares on a chessboard. Up close and personal, war separates humans from their lives and aspirations, lovers from their beloveds.The old elites loved nothing but their class and its accoutrements. It was peasant stock and noveau riche who belted out national anthems and honored the borders which in wartime could sever lover from lover but, paradoxically, also shield prison-camp escapees who made it across them to sanctuary. Renoir's genius was that he could show that an emergent new order, manifestly better on the ground, comes at a steep price, tragically, in the air.",Null,61,76,21 March 2000
"Girl, Interrupted"," Growing up absurd in the 1960s
","Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder) is eighteen in 1968, the year the world went a little crazy ... or a lot. She can't relate to her parents, her school, her future. To cure a headache, she downs an entire bottle of aspirin with a whole bottle of vodka. She is packed off to a looney bin for wayward teens.The girls she meets there, her co-loonies, are in some ways more in touch with themselves than most of the 'normal' folks walking around loose out there. They may have unfortunate habits, but how different does that make them? Her best friend Lisa (Angelina Jolie) is so refreshingly honest it's hard to bear in mind she's a sociopath.Again, these girls hurt. They hurt themselves, they hurt others. But so did we all back then, and today. Life is like that. This movie captures it meaningfully by showing us people we care about deeply, in spite of what they do and what they're like. They are just like the people we really knew, back in crazy 1968, and just like us today, underneath our brave faces and cynicism.",10,0,0,2 August 2000
