The Lobster," Vicious satire indeed
","This film is as 'vicious as it gets' when it comes to dystopian social satire. Yes, it makes fun of the way an authoritarian society might treat single or childless people. Unfortunately, it also makes fun of autism or Asperger's (or the way society reacts to some people with autism) too. The whole film is rather unpleasant to watch, a bit sickening, but it does 'teach the viewer' a lesson. The natural scenery (set in Ireland) is quite breathtaking. The classical string quartet music score in stunning. The unfolding of the backstory in the fascist society was a bit confusing at times in the second half. Could this film predict the direction of Putin's Russia?",5,0,3,21 May 2016
