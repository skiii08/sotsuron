The New World," One of my favorites...
","I watch this movie at least twice a year. I get so bored and annoyed with the high-tech, action-packed, modern-themed or future-themed nonsense that is produced today that watching The New World brings me back to the pleasure that a movie CAN be.Anyone interested in cultural anthropology or American history will love this movie. I'm sure that certain liberties were taken in the story, but that is to be expected since very little was documented about this initial contact in Virginia.The music plus the cinematography is so soothing and beautiful. Imagine yourself in 1607 coming upon a new land. Or imagine yourself being one of the 'naturals' seeing these floating houses arrive in your area.It's fascinating to see the culture clash here. Although it's sad that European disease and greed wiped out the happy, thriving indigenous culture that was already established here, it is still a fascinating story.",Null,3,6,25 December 2009
JFK," You must question authority
","Don't dishonor the dead. I served in the Vietnam war. 58,000 died for nothing because a bunch of greedy politicians and their corporate supporters wanted war. The Vietnam war would never have been the huge and shameful embarrassment that it was if Kennedy had not been murdered by these money-grubbing right-wingers. Many other horrible crimes committed by the CIA and other agencies would never have happened if JFK had lived to carry out his policies.A true Patriot keeps an eye on his government because, in THIS country, the government is US! At least, that's the way it's supposed to be.Ask yourself this: Why does the government seal records of the investigations in the assassination? Don't you think you should be able to see them? You paid for them.It is OBVIOUS that there was a conspiracy and a cover-up. But too many Americans are naive sheep who stick their heads in the sand and refuse to believe what is right in front of their eyes. Shame on you! You're not patriots -- you don't deserve the freedom you enjoy.",Null,1,12,1 December 2008
Inception," Not Impressed
","This is not my kind of movie. If I want to speculate on what is really happening, I'll read a mystery novel (something I almost never do anymore). I don't enjoy a movie that forces me to try and figure out the plot. Not that it should be totally obvious from the beginning, but this was just too much head work for me and I could tell that it was a puzzler, early on.I go to the movies for entertainment -- not to solve puzzles. After 10 minutes I walked out. I was not entertained and I knew I wouldn't be. After seeing thousands of movies I can usually tell quickly if I'm going to like it.But that's just me. I can see how others thought this movie was great but you must remember that it's not for everyone. I'm not a fan of Matrix or Tron either, so you can see why I'm not interested. Sci-Fi and puzzles are fun for some... not for me anymore.",Null,5,8,16 December 2010
