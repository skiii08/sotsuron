Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Best Movie For The Year
","I could give a whole account of this movie by simply stating what happens and what it is about. However, i believe that you can basically glean the plot of this movie from previous summaries and trailers. My job in this review is to simply tell you MY whole opinion on this movie. First let me start off by saying that Sherlock Holmes : A Web Of Shadows was the best movie i have seen for the year. With amazing slow motion effects, fast paced and intelligent action, a spellbinding plot, perfect acting, gut-busting comedy, and a fitting setting, This movie a most definitely a MUST WATCH! If you liked the first one (as did i) you may wonder how could #2 best such a compelling start. I must admit that at first even i was a bit skeptical of this movie due to the fact that most sequels never live up to the first one's glory. But surprisingly 'A Web Of Shadows' did and in my opinion bested the first one! In Conclusion, Robert Downey Jr. did an amazing job on this movie in my opinion and i definitely nominate this movie for an Oscar. Fast paced, Intelligent. Mind boggling and hilarious!",9,0,3,5 February 2012
The Prestige," Christopher Nolan yet again shows us a Masterpiece with 'The Prestige'
","Christopher Nolan with 'The Prestige', yet again shows his sheer brilliance and graces us with a Masterpiece. The Prestige revolves around the rivalry of two magicians; Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) who's friendship turns into a bitter rivalry after Robert's wife is killed in a magic trick gone wrong and he accuses Alfred of the dirty deed. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale's acting in this movie is impeccable. From the opening scene you get the feeling that both actors are literally as one with the character they are playing and this is what a top class actor must be able to do. The plot of the 'The Prestige' is intricate and genius; full of twists and turns that keep you in suspense and keep you pondering on what will happen next. I literally sat on the edge of my seat the whole movie. It is a well thought out and original plot that Christopher Nolan executes with mastery. Robert Angier's and Alfred Borden's whole past is shown and the whole story revolves around their rivalry in a manner deserving to be truly called a masterpiece. The rivalry between these two is depicted in a strong and vivid way and you feel as if you yourself are in the movie standing right next to the two characters. Nolan uses the idea of each of the obsessed characters reading each other's diary and this brings out a series of flashbacks mixed with the present happenings and this is what makes up the excellent chemistry of the movie. The whole movie is a thrill to watch and the ending is profound and fitting for the whole plot; it is unexpected and one can only but give a standing ovation. I cannot begin to explain how much this movie amazed me. Nolan set out to keep the audience thinking the whole movie and he succeeded by a landslide. It is truly a movie that one cannot ignore. A story of two men's obsession with revenge and being better than the other but who can pay the ultimate sacrifice? 'Sacrifice is the price of a good trick' --- The Prestige.",10,1,1,21 August 2012
