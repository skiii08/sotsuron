The Equalizer," Ok action movie, but has nothing to do with the TV series
","As an action movie, this would have rewarded 8 points, despite logical flaws (like, wtf, leaving fingerprints everywhere?). However, it's been styled as being about Robert McCall, the star of the TV series, but it's got nothing to do with that character. And that ain't Denzel Washington's fault, who did a stellar job, but that of the screenwriters and producers. The movie's McCaul is simply a totally different character from the TV guy. So, to advertise this movie as 'The Equalizer' is fraud, there's no way to excuse it. Younger folks who don't know the series may not care about this, but if you had been a fan, you will be disappointed.",7,1,1,1 November 2018
