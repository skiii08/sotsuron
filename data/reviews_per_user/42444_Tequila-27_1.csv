Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The best movie of the 90's.
","The Phantom Menace is my all-time favourite movie! It is a mix of action, comedy, adventure, and it can also make emotional. It is very magical. It takes a lot for me to be impressed with movies, and music, and this impresses me! The sound track to this movie is brilliant, also!",10,8,10,17 November 1999
