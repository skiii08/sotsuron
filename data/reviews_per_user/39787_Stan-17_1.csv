The Blair Witch Project," The hype machine is working overtime!!!
","With all the hype over this move, I thought it would be awesome.No suspense, no fear. I understand the concept of the movie, but it did nothing for me. It was not very believable. Are you going to tell me someone who goes hiking every weekend is going to get lost that easily? I doubt it. Things that go bump in the night are scary, but not this movie. The only thing that I find scary about the movie, is that people were actually scared!!!   At least from what I read here.  The people to the right and left of me, looked as bored as I was. I also heard several comments,  about what a waste of time  it was. I have nothing positive to say about the movie at allÂ….On a scale of 1 to 10 I'll give it a MINUS 5.",3,0,2,3 August 1999
