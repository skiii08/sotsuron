","I am not the type of person to watch a film about war. I would have never chosen to see this film on my own accord had it not been for my International Film class as I tend to stay toward happier and uplifting films, but I would have to say this is one of the most powerful films I have ever seen and for good reason. Having seen this film over a month ago, I can honestly say that it has truly reverberated with me as its message is so powerful. All five senses are impeccably impacted, whether by choice or not. This is the only film I have ever seen where sight, hearing, touch, taste and even smell has practically jumped off screen, impacting me in the most profound way. I felt as though my own nose was smelling the soup that Flyora and Glasha ate, just as I felt as though I was trekking through the swamp filled with sewage and bodies, just trying to make it across. This film is definitely not for those with weak stomachs, as there are many gruesome scenes. Although horrific, these scenes are what make the movie so real and honest. This is an honest portrayal of war and what happens, not the Hollywood version of it. Watching Flyora's transformation on screen from young boy to WWII Byelorussia war veteran, we see a complete alteration of him as a person. Midway through the film, we encounter his shift as he no longer looks like a boy, but weathered man with a constant stare on his face, as though he is no longer fazed by anything, be it life or death. The most horrific scenes in this film are the most powerful, from the burning of the shed to Flyora's dying father, this film does a wonderful job of evoking human emotion and sentiment. I believe that the most powerful scene however is when Flyora uses his gun for the first time throughout his entire journey, and that it is not aimed at a physical person. This film is extremely raw and stuns you as the movie continues. I was not able to comprehend some of the scenes that were occurring as they are so different from my day to day life, but they opened my eyes to the reality that is war. The soundtrack was almost eerie at times, mimicking the eerie scenes on screen. As Mozart's 'Requiem' played, I couldn't help but be thankful that this is not my life, but merely a portrayal of someone else's, expressing the resilience and steadfast sense of purpose that those in combat must continue to have. I think that although I wasn't able to grasp the depth of some of the scenes as they were occurring, I was able to long after the film had ended, proving the immense impact it had on me personally. I wouldn't say that I enjoyed this film as that is not the correct word, but I was more entranced by not only its message but also its images. This is a must see for anyone, especially anyone interested in joining the army, as it gives an unfiltered perspective that is bound to impact you in one way or another.",10,2,2,9 June 2010
