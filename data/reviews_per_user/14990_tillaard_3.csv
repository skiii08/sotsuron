The New World," Be prepared to be bored rigid
","I haven't been bored by a motion picture this much in a long, long, long time. If you want to spend your free time with any sense then please let this one go by.The story is slow going, lacks direction, is not very believable and the conversation is uninteresting to say the very, very least. Sometimes the cinematography can raise the level of a movie with a historic setting a little, but even in this department the movie fails to score.I can only recommend this movie if there is absolutely nothing in the house that can make you go to sleep. This production will surely do the job in that case.",2,2,7,22 January 2007
Collateral," Very gripping and terrifying story. The build of tension is very good and reaches very high levels. Recommended
","Collateral is a very powerful movie. You feel very connected to the main character Max, and you can really feel for the horror and disgust he is experiencing throughout the story. The story starts one late L.A.-afternoon and ends early next morning. Therefor almost the entire photography consists of night- and inhouse shots with very little light. Photography is very good with well worked out viewpoints, out-of-focus-shots and camera movement which increase tension and involvement. There are no dull moments in this movie. Max' character is very real. He is a nice guy but has his own flaws and shortcomings which make him very believable. One of the great things about the movie is to witness how Max's initial fear and being-completely-out-of-control gradually changes into anger and initiative. At the end of the movie I feel that Mann made Max a bigger man then he need have done, but still you can identify yourself with him. The dialogue between Max and Vincent (Cruise) is also not middle-of-the-road. Although Vincent's attitude is very two-dimensional: he is hit-man with little or no compassion or remorse, the conversations in the cab with Max still have some depth in them. Vincent develops some respect for Max as a result of their conversations. When you go see this movie you will feel yourself imersed very quickly and really feel the tension Max feels. The movie also shows a very violent, dark and sinister side of big-city life which can become very alienating.",8,1,1,24 November 2004
300," Shallow and predictable
","I saw this movie but was utterly disappointed. It is a very two dimensional plot and the film doesn't seem to have any resemblance to a possible historical event.The movie doesn't contain ANY on-scene scenes. It's all studio based stuff and A LOT of computer animation. This is where you might want to be for a video game, but not if you want to make an appealing and believable movie.The dialog doesn't have any depth, is predictable and does little to help the story.The only things this movie has going for it are strong visuals, all be it mostly animated, and nice costumes.Give this one a pass by all means.",2,12,18,28 August 2007
