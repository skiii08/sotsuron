Vertigo," The best movie of all time? Not quite, but close...
","'Sight and Sound' magazine's 2012 poll named Alfred Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' the best movie of all time. So, this review should settle the big question – is it really the best movie of all time? The answer to that is no, but it does make a very good case for itself. It's a detective story about obsession and fear, and the Master of Suspense manages to tackle both of those themes very well. In a shot that is now much mimicked and parodied, the 'Vertigo Shot' seen when Stewart is climbing up the bell tower is still just as effective 55 years later, echoing the fear that Stewart has.The plot is extremely clever, with the first half following a classic yet slightly unnerving detective story, but the second half detailing the obsessions of Scottie and building up to the final reveal at the very end of the film. We are constantly lead to believe in the first half that something supernatural is going on with Madeline, and it is even more satisfying to find out towards the end that it is not, as the real explanation is just as good. The love that blossoms between the two of them is very interesting, as it makes her sudden 'suicide' even more shocking. In a technique that Hitchcock uses in 'Psycho' as well, killing off a main character unexpectedly in the first half of the movie works brilliantly in keeping the audience guessing where he will go next.The second half of the film allows us to see into the subconscious of Scottie, and we wonder constantly how much he knows about 'Judy' and how much is an obsession with 'Madeline'. His character is made to seem even creepier through the fact that he only realises very late that the two are the same, meaning that he has been making 'Judy' dress up as his recently deceased lover to satisfy his own needs. Hitchcock is clever in revealing sooner that they are the same character, as it adds more to our guessing how much he knows.Herrmann's score to the film is once again brilliant, with his romantic use of strings in the 'Love Theme' and fantastic 'Prelude' theme. The music complements the film perfectly, and is one of Herrmann's best scores for Hitchcock. So, with all of the positive things I've said, why isn't it up there for the best movie of all time? It's slightly overlong, and occasionally too confusing. But the main thing is that it's not Hitchcock's best work. It doesn't quite reach the great heights of his next two films – 'North by Northwest' or 'Psycho', both of which go slightly further in their mystery and cleverness. That said, it is another fantastic thriller from the Master, and a must see for any film lover.",9,2,5,26 August 2013
Changeling," It's 'A True Story'. I don't know if they mentioned that.,
","There is one thing which the posters for Clint Eastwood's 'Changeling' are very keen to tell you. It's 'A True Story'. Not 'Based on a true story' or 'inspired by real events'. It's all true. And it's really strange watching the film knowing this, as it all seems so unbelievable. We follow Angelina Jolie as Christine Collins, a woman whose child goes missing, and her quest to find her son when the police are corrupt and not trying to help at all. The strangest part of the narrative is the fact that it keeps going to new places. One minute she's protesting against the police, then she's at a mental hospital, then they're finding dead children at a ranch, then it's a courtroom drama. Despite so many changes of pace and style, the movie never feels hard to follow or dull. It always keeps you interested, longing to find out what really has happened to Walter Collins. It also makes you think a lot about the corrupt police department, and the horrors of such a thing existing. Angelina Jolie gives an incredibly emotional performance as Christine Collins here, and we really feel for the character and see her grief constantly. We hope for her to find her son so much, and that level of connection is definitely down to Jolie's acting. The scene when Collins first sees the 'changeling' child is particularly gripping, and her clash with the head of the police department is proof of her great acting ability. Another great performance here is given by Jason Butler Harner as the psychopath Gordon Northcott, as we witness the insanity of the character. It was strange for me watching this on the same day that I saw Hitchcock's 'Psycho', as there are definite parallels in the performances by both Harner and Perkins as psychos.Eastwood once again proves his incredible ability as a director and the movie is also very visually stunning, with amazing CGI cityscapes. It's also very gory, which came as a shock 80 minutes in after what was a fairly tame first act. Northcott's murders and Jolie's time at the mental institution are both very difficult to watch at times, and this does help with the realism of the story. There are many points during the final act when the film could easily come to a close, but unlike 'Lord of the Rings', each further ending feels necessary once it's over. I thought the choice to keep Collins' search perpetual and say that she 'kept looking for her son' was nicely ambiguous, continuing the sense of hope for all of the optimists in the audience.",9,1,2,11 July 2013
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Baron Cohen lampoons everything, with no exceptions...
","I can still remember very clearly the time 'Borat' came out, mainly because everyone that I seemed to interact with was talking about. The posters were everywhere, it was in the news, the hype was enormous. Somehow it took me 8 years to see it, but for a film which is incredibly topical it still feels alarmingly relevant. It's crude and offensive, and yet extremely funny because of the situations that go on. Of course, Sacha Baron Cohen shines in the title role, lampooning everything he can with no exceptions.For anyone that's been living under a rock for the past 8 years, Borat is a Kazakh journalist who goes around tricking people into doing or saying absurd things. We meet him in a rural town in Kazakhstan, where he is sent by the government to America in order to make a documentary about their culture. He goes with his producer, Azamat, with whom he has a sometimes rocky relationship, and they meet people from all walks of life. The character is inherently funny as a cultural stereotype who is stupid and offensive, but the real laughs in the film come from the reactions of other people. Because he is often so plausible, people will do or say things that they wouldn't on US television, and he baits his targets with ridiculous situations just to see how they'd react.It's a film based less on plot and more on hilarious set-pieces, which become even funner because the reactions are genuine and unscripted. Borat releases chickens on the subway, sings made up words to the US national anthem at a rodeo, embarrasses himself at a a dining club, goes to a Pentecostal church meeting and has a naked fight with Azamat through a crowded hotel. The stunts are all hilarious, and made even more-so by the fact that they actually happened - it's really just a standard road movie, but accentuated by being real.At the start of the film, you try to figure out who the film is satirising through its offence. It seems anti-Semitic or anti-Kazakhstan, but it soon becomes quite clear who the fools of the film are - the American people. Borat is there to exploit American stereotypes of nationalism, rednecks, conservatives and Christian crazies. Sure, he's a stereotype, but the fact that he's so often taken as genuine shows Americans as gullible and stupid. His choice is dangerous, however, since there are many who won't understand the depth of this lampooning, and instead think it's okay to be anti-Semitic etc. In this way, the film very occasionally crosses a line in terms of taste.The film is just over 80 minutes long, and this feels like the perfect length for it. Any more and the jokes might become tiresome - there isn't really a proper plot to any of it, just a series of vignettes. Having finally experienced it, I can instantly tell why it was such a craze and has become so iconic - it's quotable, and nearly every scene makes you laugh. In this way, it's better than a vast number of scripted comedies these days. Shouldn't we be worried about this?",8,1,1,31 January 2015
Captain Phillips," The fact that it's true that makes the film even more unbelievable, supplementing the experience of the film rather than causing it...
","The second Paul Greengrass review I've written today, and it's odd how two of his films, 'United 93' and 'Captain Phillips', can be so similar in some respects, and yet so original and different in others. Both films are ultra-realistic and emotionally charged, telling stories of real events. However they both have so much merit to them for different things. One of the things Greengrass does best, especially here, is making you care about the story itself, the performances you're watching, and not the fact that it is a true story. It is the fact that it's true that makes the film even more unbelievable, supplementing the experience of the film rather than causing it.'Captain Phillips' tells the story of Richard Phillips, played by Tom Hanks, and how the container ship that he manned was hijacked by Somali pirates. You are shown the character of Phillips in great detail beforehand, especially his keenness on safety and following things by the book. When the pirates eventually manage to come on board in what is a heart-in-mouth sequence, Hanks is at his very best, managing to carry across both a large amount of fear and an attempt to seem calm. It is simply baffling that Hanks didn't get a Best Actor nomination for this, since he is consistently brilliant throughout, most of all in the very cathartic final scene where he breaks down during his medical.The brilliance of the film comes through two things: you constantly feel like you're in the midst of all of the action and, despite the fact that you know how it's going to end, you have no idea how it's going to get there. When the pirates, played extremely convincingly by mostly first-time actors, are about to leave the ship, it feels like the film's about to end, and it could have there. I was incredibly glad that it didn't, since the second half is even more white-knuckle than the first. The claustrophobic confines of the lifeboat are terrifying, and you're constantly trying to figure out how Hanks is going to escape. The answer to this is through Navy SEALs, and a second fantastic sequence takes place during the final rescue attempt.As always, Greengrass doesn't glamourise the events at all, and a lot of it is thrilling, gory and hard to watch. The original story of Phillips wasn't covered as widely in the UK, so I was fairly unfamiliar with it. It doesn't matter that it's true, and that's the real success of the film. You care about the characters there and then and are constantly in the moment, rather than considering the time that it actually happened.",10,0,1,26 January 2014
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This should never be seen as a bad movie...
","'The Phantom Menace' should never be seen as a bad movie. Because it really isn't. There's a lot of merit in it, and it's a great addition to the Star Wars franchise. Well then, why do so many people hate it? I suppose there are a lot of reasons. The die-hard Star Wars fans, ie. most adults who grew up with it, hate it because it's messing with their childhood, ruining the film franchise that they grew up with. I didn't grow up with the original Star Wars trilogy, therefore was viewing this film with a completely open mind when I saw it recently. Is it a terrible film? No.Let's start with the visuals, because they are really where this film is strongest. It's all pretty stunning, with incredible cityscapes and backdrops to the story. The spaceships are really beautiful and many of the CGI characters look pretty convincing for a film made in 1999. When looking upon the stands at the race, it's hard to believe that there are hundreds of animated characters, as it all looks very real. The race scene itself is one of the best parts of the film. It's exciting and fun, and it's one of the few moments in the whole trilogy when you're rooting for Anakin to win, as he becomes far too annoying for you to care in later instalments.The overarching plot itself is a bit rubbish, and the whole 'trade problems' thing completely passed me by. To me, the plot of the movie is that Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan go to a planet, find a kid with special force powers like them, take him with them, fight off Darth Maul at the end. There were some parts of the plot that I really did enjoy. I love the fact that Chancellor Palpatine is so obviously evil, even if you haven't seen the originals, but nobody seems to notice it. Also, the whole 'Padmé is the Queen' twist, despite being really obvious, is quite fun. There were moments early on when I couldn't entirely figure out whether they had switched, but eventually I was certain, and it's a great moment when everyone finally realises.Now onto the things that I disliked about the film. Firstly, it's a bit dull in places, and you just want them to get on with it and have some cool action. Secondly, and most importantly, is Jar Jar Binks. I've said it before, but he has to be the most irritating character in movie history. I mean, just how much time could they all have saved if Jar Jar wasn't tagging along with them. I'm sure George Lucas must have thought he was endearing or something, but moments like the electrocuted tongue are more annoying than entertaining. While good on a visual side, the battle with the Gungans and droids at the end is also a bit tedious, and runs along for much more time than it should.",7,5,9,30 June 2013
United 93," I feel like this is the only 9/11 movie I need to see...
","There are some events which are clearly ingrained into our minds, and especially into the American psyche (or so I would guess, being British myself). Events such as the Apollo 13 mission or JFK conspiracies have both been portrayed on film extremely successfully, and both of these films ('Apollo 13' and 'JFK') seem like the only representations of those events that need to exist. Even if not completely accurate, they are the only films of these events that we need. 9/11 is an event which is still stuck in our memories, and has been portrayed in a countless number of movies. However, having seen 'United 93″, I feel like this is the only one that I need to see.The film does not focus on the two planes that flew into the World Trade Centre, or the one that flew into the Pentagon. It focuses on a lesser known story – the fourth plane. I think this was exactly the right decision. I've certainly grown up with the very familiar images of smoke coming from both towers, and it's a story which I feel I know very well. The fourth plane is much less well known, but it's a story which should be told more: one of heroism in the face of a horrible fate, and people who gave their own lives to save so many others.Paul Greengrass is exactly the right director to have made this film. The documentary-like style which he has shown off in 'Captain Phillips' and the 'Bourne' movies fits this perfectly, throwing you into the action not only on the plane, but also into the control rooms. He makes you a part of the event, giving you a very real and harrowing sense of the fear felt by the passengers and the chaos of those on the ground. The actors are all newcomers, and many of those on the ground play themselves. There's no sense of celebrity, but that these are real people, making things all the more realistic.It's a tricky film to watch in many places, somewhat inevitably because of the nature of the event, but ultimately worth it in trying to understand what people must have felt being on that plane. The one place where the film could suffer is in its ending. Because the event is recent and familiar, we all know how it's going to end. The final few minutes are nothing less than brilliant and emotionally charged as you know what's coming. Greengrass takes an enormous risk in ending the film where he does, but it pays off, and you leave the film feeling that he was right to do so. He in no way glamourises the event, and it's the harsh realism which he brings to the film that makes it such a worthwhile watch.",9,2,3,26 January 2014
Gravity," 'Gravity' is a simply breathtaking film, and is hands down the best movie of 2013...
","'Gravity' first came onto my radar about halfway through 2012, on one of those lists of films to look forward to later that year. The film's release was delayed quite a bit, but more information kept coming through in early 2013. In January, I declared, somewhat ambitiously, that it would be the best film to be released in 2013. After I watched the mind-boggling 'Children of Men' for the first time in April last year, I was certain that I would love this as well. I built it up so much, told everyone that it was going to be amazing, and then in the few minutes before it started, I panicked. What if I'd over-hyped it and ended up underwhelmed? The lights went down, and within minutes of the start of the film, I knew I'd been right. 'Gravity' is a simply breathtaking film, and is hands down the best movie of 2013.Let's start with the plot. I won't say too much about it, for once, because I managed to go into this knowing almost nothing except the basics, and it made it even more magical for me. The film follows Dr Ryan Stone (Bullock), a teacher and astronaut, on her first mission in space. She is on the last spacewalk of her mission with Matt Kowalski (Clooney), when the Hubble Space Telescope is hit by space debris, and they are separated, with Stone floating through space. Over the course of a mesmerising and thrilling 90 minutes, Stone and Kowalski attempt to get safely back to earth. The plot, however, is not the film's most important part. The two characters are interesting, and their dialogue and character developments manage to be funny and moving at times. Clooney does a great job as the experienced astronaut, while Bullock is simply outstanding, bringing across the fear and emotion of her character so well. For Stone, the journey is not just one about getting back to Earth, but it's also a rebirth for her, getting over the loss of her daughter, and Bullock makes you feel the pain that she does.The film's main attraction is undoubtedly the visuals – It's like nothing I've ever seen before. The CGI of space is flawless and beautiful, and especially in 3D (it's one of the 3 films I've ever seen where 3D is worth it) you actually do feel like you're stuck out there with them. Cuaron's direction is completely evident, with his love of long takes coming through here. The first shot of the movie is around 17 minutes, and the constant panning of the camera to show you the action and vastness of space is not at all irritating, as you would expect. The film has everything, interesting characters, a good action plot, and fantastic visuals, and will keep you white-knuckle for the entirety of its running time. I have no doubt that this is one of the most original and stunning films I've seen released in recent years, and cannot wait for Cuaron's next effort.",10,2,5,27 January 2014
Se7en," I think 'Se7en' is my favourite David Fincher film...
","I think 'Se7en' is my favourite David Fincher film, and given the body of work which the director has so far produced, that was not an easy decision to make. Much as I adore the intense character study of 'The Social Network', the dark mind-games of 'Gone Girl' and the rich storytelling in 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button', I feel that 'Se7en' is Fincher showing off everything he does best. It's a brooding, jet black thriller which makes you look inwardly and consider so many aspects of human nature.In the film, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play homicide detectives – one recently transferred to a large city, the other getting ready for retirement. On paper, their relationship is a detective cliché, but Pitt and Freeman's chemistry ensures that it transcends this. The pair start to discover a string of horrific murders, each one linked to one of the seven deadly sins, and attempt to track down the killer. They get closer and closer, and it becomes almost a game as the detectives try to prevent the next murder from occurring. There are twists and turns at every single corner up to the point where the murderer actually hands himself in, and even then you can tell that the game is barely over.It's a film with a very clear process from the beginning, but this is not a bad thing. It takes you along so you feel like you know what's going to happen next, and then subverts your expectation right at the next step. The three lead performances are all brilliant, but the standout performance is that of Spacey, whose slow speech and constant calmness turn him into such a convincing psychopath. The greatest scene in the film is in set in a car, towards the end of the film, when Spacey explains his reasoning for committing the murders. The terrifying thing about the scene is that you can, in a way, completely understand the murderer's point, and this is cemented greatly by Spacey's performance.As is to be expected from Fincher, the visuals in the film are incredible, and he doesn't waste a moment when he can shock. Each of the portrayals of the seven sins is as shocking as the next, and 'gluttony' doesn't really kick things off that lightly. But again, Fincher's success is in disturbing his audience merely by suggestion rather than explicitly showing them anything. The murder based on 'lust' isn't even described that graphically, but the very idea that it produces causes it to be one of the most difficult to watch scenes in the movie.In 'Se7en', Fincher has created a near-perfect thriller. There is not a bored moment in the entire film, and not even Gwyneth Paltrow's presence can spoil the atmosphere or enjoyment. Pitt, Freeman and Spacey complement each other perfectly, and help the film to achieve something that is actually relatively rare in movies of this genre – it actually makes your heart race.",10,3,5,10 February 2015
Star Trek," Where 'Star Trek' fails is in its methods as a sci-fi/action film...
","How much you enjoy a film 'reboot' can often depend on what you saw of the original source material. Before I had seen 'Batman Begins' or 'Casino Royale', I had little experience of those franchises, and went in with no expectations of what the film should be. I am of the firm belief that my hatred of 'The Amazing Spider-Man' stems mostly from my love of the original Tobey Maguire films, and the fact that they just don't do as good a job. My experience of 'Star Trek' was almost non existent. I was very aware of the show, its fans, and really liked 'Galaxy Quest', but had never actually watched the TV show. The movie's success comes in its ability to make itself accessible to an audience of non-Trekkies, while likely still pleasing the fans. Where it fails is in its methods as a sci-fi/action film.'Star Trek' goes down the 'origins' story route, a method that should be familiar to reboot fans. We learn about James Kirk and how he became captain of the Starship Enterprise. It's an interesting, yet somewhat clichéd character arc which he undergoes – he's a wild child that has to become responsible in order to fill his destiny. However, Chris Pine plays it well, ensuring that you care enough about him throughout. Zachary Quinto is the real star as the film, and is emotionally convincing as Mr. Spock. The Spock/Kirk dynamic is something that works extremely well, and there's some great chemistry between the two characters. Also, the scenes on earth and those leading up to Kirk's arrival on the Enterprise are the best of the film, bringing light- relief and character development together very well.Because of the need for character changes throughout, the plot takes a slightly more backseat role, and for a large percentage between the opening sequence and about halfway, you forget about the film's main villain. The visual effects are stunning, as you might expect from JJ Abrams, and do help to make the film more exciting. The 'origins' plot does mean that action is more sidelined, with few great action sequences throughout. And, unfortunately, this causes the film to drag at times.I imagine, were I a huge 'Star Trek' fan, the film would be much more rewarding, as it seems to pay fan service frequently with references here and there, and especially the appearance of Leonard Nimoy. But as an outsider, I was frequently disinterested by the film. The film does have great moments, but I think this is one franchise which I won't be returning to. Hopefully JJ Abrams' attempts at 'Star Wars' are more like the superb 'Super 8′, and less like this.",7,0,1,16 February 2014
Fight Club," The mixed morals are thankfully only an afterthought...
","And so I returned to my fear of watching IMDb Top 10 films for the first time with 'Fight Club', worried what I was going to think of it and afraid that I seemingly be the only person that didn't like it. By the end of the film, my fears were mostly quelled, but there was still a niggling feeling that something wasn't quite right. I couldn't immediately see what point 'Fight Club' was trying to make, and for me it felt like it had mixed morals, but those are merely an afterthought in what is a stylish, humorous and very well acted movie.The unnamed narrator of the film is played by Edward Norton, and provides witty and nihilistic commentary throughout the film. His life is boring, he is an insomniac with mental health issues that go even deeper than that, and he needs to find some excitement. He starts going to support groups for the terminally ill just so that he can feel emotional outlet, a method that's also carried out by Helena Bonham Carter's character. It's a foul idea, but the film very nearly makes you able to see where they're coming from. On a flight one day, he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), and sees a man that is everything that he's ever wanted to be – successful, exciting, daring, attractive, not stuck in a boring day-to-day job. The Narrator and Durden start spending more time together, and that's when things get crazy.Through the pair's setting up of a Fight Club, initially as a substitute for the support groups, but eventually as a training ground for their minions, we are subjected to a horrific amount of violence and animalism. The Narrator gets carried away, spurred on by Durden, and they embark on 'Project Mayhem', an operation whose sole intention is to mess stuff up and 'destroy capitalism'. It is only after a sudden blackout from Norton's character that we are provided with our twist, a discovery that changes the entire meaning of the film, and the final half hour does an extremely good job of working out and justifying that.It's a film that is held up by its performances and styling. Norton and Pitt work off each other extremely well, with Norton's narration providing an interesting and witty commentary over the bleak events of the movie. In a film as dark as this, finding yourself laughing really does make you look at yourself. Bonham Carter is brilliant, yet severely underused, and her character could have been made so much more prominent to provide a bit more of the 'twisted moral compass' that she seems to have. The film is shot through a darkened lens, which superbly captures the rainy, dingy and crumbling world that the characters inhabit.'Fight Club' is a film with a message, shown by The Narrator's eventual rejection of Durden's ways and philosophy, but only just. He doesn't want to become like him, ruining everything and destroying things for the sake of it. The problem I have with the film is the way that it gets there – in displaying the violent and anarchistic build up to its lead character's rejection of those ways, it glamourises it. The whole point of the film is that we too are taken in as followers of Tyler Durden and his ways, and I worry that, even though the actual Fight Club scenes are only a small part of the film, their extreme nature does more harm than good. It may not be advocating violence, but to people who don't quite absorb its message, it may seem like it does.Despite the hype and huge cult following of the film, it's not Fincher's best work. It has great set-pieces, performances and visuals, but the plot occasionally jumps around confusingly and the message has a tendency to feel muddled. It is worth watching and for the vast majority of the runtime really enjoyable, but perhaps my best advice would be not to read too deeply into it.",8,0,2,1 February 2015
12 Angry Men," Imagine a filmmaker walking into a boardroom today and trying to pitch this...
","Imagine a filmmaker walking into a boardroom today and trying to pitch the following movie: 12 men sit in a room for 90 minutes in real time and argue with each other. They're discussing a murder case, but the murder isn't actually shown, they just talk about it. It would be shot down today, because it's not the kind of movie that we're used to seeing in cinemas – public tastes have changed. Or so Hollywood seems to think, but this movie is in IMDb's 10 top rated movies of all time. This took me slightly by surprise before I saw '12 Angry Men'. It's a movie made more than 50 years ago, and yet it's still more popular than any 'Lord of the Rings' or 'Star Wars' film. It's a testament to the public, I think, showing that old movies have not grown stale, and are still appreciated as much as new flicks.The film itself completely deserves its position on the IMDb list. It's not one of the best movies ever made, but it is a skilfully crafted, well acted drama which is intellectually stimulating and actually quite thrilling throughout, despite the lack of action. It's far more than it says on the tin, since each one of its 12 characters is well written and of great importance to the story. Henry Fonda particularly shines in the film as the one juror trying to fight for a 'not guilty' verdict on the grounds of reasonable doubt. He takes it upon himself to convince the other 11 to change their minds, and through this, changes the audience's view of the case as well. The progression of his arguments and logic is extremely clever and his unpicking of information that we've had throughout makes us admire him even more.The film covers so much ground in so little time and space. All of the jurors are unnamed for the majority of the film, and we're not dealing with specific characters most of the time, but members of the public from all parts of society. There's someone each of us can relate to, and we leave the film considering how we would deal with the case. Lumet uses the single setting to his technical advantage, managing to create a disturbing sense of claustrophobia as the film progresses, and the use of real time is so important in making us feel like we're on the same level as the characters and not missing a single detail.'12 Angry Men' completely deserves to be seen as a classic. It's both a masterly technical achievement, and a fantastic lesson in mob mentality and not being afraid to go against a crowd.",9,1,2,31 December 2013
Zodiac," A stylish, well acted and particularly grisly thriller...
","There are two crucial details which set 'Zodiac' apart from any other serial-killer film (like Fincher's own 'Se7en', for example) – it's based on a true story, and that true story still doesn't have an ending. To this day, much like Jack the Ripper, the identity of the 'Zodiac' killer still hasn't been confirmed, which leaves an interesting dilemma for any filmmaker attempting to adapt the story. Do you leave the film without a resolution, or sway against the truth and invent an ending? Neither of those two options is perfect, but thankfully the process of the film is thrilling enough that a complete conclusion is never particularly necessary. It's a stylish, well acted and particularly grisly thriller which skilfully tackles ideas about obsession and the need for an answer despite never actually getting one itself.Starring Jake Gyllenhaal as a cartoonist who becomes fascinated by the murders, the film follows his attempts to solve the case with the help of a journalist at his newspaper, played by Robert Downey Jr, and local detective, played by Mark Ruffalo. The case gets increasingly complex as more murders (which are shown in extremely graphic detail) take place and the unknown murderer continues to taunt the police through his cryptic letters. At its very best, it is an exercise in creating tension in its audience, especially when the Zodiac killer is on the phone live on TV, or when Gyllenhaal's character is searching a suspect's house.At its infrequent worst, however, the film drags as a result of its methods – while the first half of the film is relatively close together in time, it begins to jump later and ends up spanning nearly 20 years. There are slow passages where little new information is learned, and you long for either another murder scene or something crucial to happen. Thankfully it is held up most of the time by brilliant performances from all three leads (Downey Jr is probably at his least annoying here), who work together very well and convey the constant mystery of their situation very well. Gyllenhaal deserves particular praise for his excellent portrayal of an obsessive, who cannot stop until the case is closed.If anything, this feels like a classic Fincher film, with its moody cinematography and 'keeps you guessing' plot-line. The music adds both suspense and a large amount of nostalgia through its referencing of period classics, and the film's desire to transport you back entirely to the 70s is very commendable. It's an entertaining if sometimes slow-going thriller, and certain to give you your own theories about this ongoing real-life murder case.",8,0,0,28 January 2015
Once," This has great songs, beautiful romance, and is just a really great film overall...
","When a movie has a minuscule budget, often sacrifices have to be made which can change the overall look or feel of the film. Things like special lighting and special effects are kept to a minimum, while locations are very simplistic. And often, this can be an extremely positive thing for a film, adding to its charm because of its simplistic nature. This is precisely one of the things which make 'Once' such a charming and wonderful movie – the constant realism which flows throughout the film. It's got great songs, beautiful romance and is just a really great film overall.When the 'Guy' (Glen Hansard) is out busking one day, he meets and gets talking to the 'Girl' (Markéta Irglová), a Czech flower seller. There is clear chemistry between the two, and they meet again the next day and play music together. The nature of their relationship is always kept at a distance, since the Girl is married but her husband lives in the Czech Republic, and the Guy wants to get back together with his ex-girlfriend in London. Therefore, the two, along with a band of buskers, record a demo album so that the Guy can show it to the ex-girlfriend when he meets her. The ending is both incredibly daring and very satisfying, not falling back on classic Hollywood romance clichés.However, plot in 'Once' is not as important as the songs which feature throughout, a mixture of ballads and folk songs. 'Falling Slowly', the film's main song which ended up winning an Academy Award, is a beautiful song, and its context within the movie is both simple and beautiful. The songs are all played naturally in the film, with one exception in 'If You Want Me', a heartbreaking love song which the Girl sings with headphones in while walking down the street, and with the singing voice of the Guy played in the background. It's a bit more like a music video in that scene, but it's well shot and a brief moment of suspending the audience's disbelief.The two leads are not professional actors, and neither are the majority of the supporting cast, but this merely adds to the naturalism which the film exudes. Director John Carney shoots it in a very natural way too, saving up any fancy camera-work until the very end. The film is brief, with a running time of only 86 minutes, but it fills that whole time with interest and never feels slow. Ultimately, 'Once' is a beautiful and heartbreaking love story, with songs that you won't be able to get out of your head for weeks afterwards.",8,1,1,4 June 2014
The Adventures of Tintin," Spielberg goes back to his roots with an Indiana Jones style adventure movie...
","With films like 'Duel' and 'Jaws', Steven Spielberg perfected the 'high concept thriller' – movies that could really be summed up in one sentence. Over time, he moved onto more personal dramas, and then at the start of the 2000s, futuristic science fiction. Most of the time he's extremely successful in finding new genres, but it often feels far departed from his original ideas. With 'The Adventures of Tintin', he goes back to his roots with an Indiana Jones style adventure featuring everyone's favourite boy detective. It's visually stunning, extremely exciting and a movie for all ages.The film follows Tintin, played by former 'Billy Elliot', Jamie Bell, on a quest involving a sunken ship – the Unicorn. Along the way, he meets drunken ship's captain, Captain Haddock, played by motion-capture pioneer Andy Serkis, and the villainous Ivan Sakharine, played by Daniel Craig. The adventure takes them all over the world, to different locations and landscapes, which are all visually exciting and provide for great action sequences. We later discover that Haddock and Sakharine's rivalry goes back generations, and there are some fantastic scenes which show the two's ancestors fighting just as the two are now. The supporting cast is also great, especially the choice of Nick Frost and Simon Pegg as the bumbling detectives Thompson and Thompson.What makes this unique as a Spielberg film is the use of motion-capture animation, a new realm for the director. He takes to it extremely well, embracing the visual possibilities that it presents and allowing him to direct the camera towards the action straight away. In numerous chase scenes, the excitement comes partly through the chaotic camera-work, in scenes that would not be possible in live-action. He can give you different perspectives, particularly those of Tintin's dog, Snowy, and much more easily give you information that the protagonists don't have.The script is extremely sharp and often very funny, making this well-paced adventure even more enjoyable. It never feels slow, always taking the adventure to a new place with a new lead which is just as interesting as the previous one. The scene on the plane and fight sequence on the old ship are particularly enjoyable. The one problem the film has is its ending, which is far too sudden a cliffhanger, and doesn't leave the events of the movie resolved enough to be satisfying. It would work much better if there was a firm finale to one case, which leads to an even bigger plot for the inevitable sequel. This is partially what the writers attempted, but it's not complete enough to work. The very fact that a sequel is being made excites me, however, since this is a constantly enjoyable adventure movie, which does justice to Hergé's original comics.",8,0,0,2 June 2014
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," I did feel that this was the weakest part of the Original trilogy...
","It might just have been the fact that I was watching this for the first time in the early hours of the morning, but I did feel that this was the weakest part of the Original trilogy, by a fair way. That's not to say that it's a bad movie, it's far from it. There are so many fantastic pieces to this film, rounding off nearly everything which has been brought up previously. It's okay that it doesn't work as well as the other two parts because it's the last part of a big trilogy. When you're closing off so many plot strands, it's difficult to make everything run smoothly, and I think this film attempts it valiantly.I love the opening scenes with Jabba the Hutt. He's probably one of the most disgusting-looking creatures in any movie I've seen before. The 'flawless' plan of Luke and Leia is great, and you're convinced that it's worked until it cuts to Jabba and his minions watching Leia and Han. The plan that they do successfully execute before Han and Luke are given to the Sarlacc (the addition to which I hated in the 'Special Edition') is exciting and has one of the better fight scenes of the trilogy. Yoda's death is another great scene, as he became so beloved in the previous films. However, it does lead onto the most ludicrous plot twist of the trilogy. Luke and Leia are siblings. It's a stupid twist which I disliked thoroughly, since it felt very contrived and like it had been made up gratuitously between Episodes V and VI. What makes it obviously worse is that the pair share a kiss earlier on in the trilogy, which George Lucas certainly wouldn't have done if he'd decided beforehand that they were related.I also thought that most of the second half was slightly drawn out, and occasionally it dragged too much. Also, the Ewoks are ridiculously creepy, but their chase scene is well paced. My favourite part of the film was the ending, because of the final twist which for me was completely unexpected. The fact that Vader, who is seen beforehand as the epitome of evil, manages to change his ways so that he can save his son is touching and does feel very surprising. Their final scene together, and the appearance of 'Prequel Trilogy' Anakin at the very end, does confirm that he does have some good in him, and that no character is pure evil. It manages to add depth to Vader, which helps this film out greatly.As a trilogy closer, this is one of the better ones out there, but as a standalone, I do think that it is slightly too long and dragged out. But maybe that's just because I started watching it for the first time at midnight. Who knows.",8,1,4,29 June 2013
American Sniper," I'm not a big fan of glamourising war...
","I've never been a big fan of glamourising war. This doesn't mean that I don't like war films - 'Saving Private Ryan' is one of the best films I've ever seen, but I think its success comes mostly from its desire to show it at its most brutal and emotional. Nobody watches 'Saving Private Ryan' and thinks 'I can't wait to sign up'. I could tell, therefore, from the very opening minutes of 'American Sniper' that it was going to irritate me somewhat. It's a film that makes a point that I do agree with, but unfortunately it takes two hours to even begin making it.In the film, we are told the true story of Chris Kyle, a Navy SEAL who spends most of his time lying on the top of buildings squinting through the sight of his gun and shooting people who don't know he's there. It opens with a fairly shocking realisation, that he is going to have to kill a child who is about to throw a grenade at one of the US tanks. We then cut away to a montage of Kyle's growing up and development. He watches 9/11 on the TV and decides that he needs to fight for his country - he is a true patriot. (I was initially annoyed at the use of 9/11 as a plot point, but then remembered it's a true story, and let it off slightly). What follows is 2 hours of war, interspersed with a bit of his family life, but to the extent that everything feels clipped. Of those in the army, only Kyle really has enough time spent on him, so when the others die it never packs the emotional punch that it should. We get brief snippets of Sienna Miller, who plays Taya Kyle, being unhappy with Chris' devotion and damage, but never long enough that you truly care.This would all be okay if it wasn't for a crucial flaw in the film's process - nothing made me care about Chris Kyle for the vast majority of the runtime. A biopic only really succeeds if you're rooting for the main character, and here I didn't feel that at all. Bradley Cooper does act fairly well, but the material is lacking and this causes the film to feel like a list of his kills rather than an emotional journey. The saving grace of the film is the very end, when he resigns from service after his fourth term (most of his friends seem to be dead by now), and he decides to do some good at home. He helps out veterans with little hope, and we see the effects of shell-shock on him. Finally, we're given the slightest glimpse that war isn't as cool or easy as you might think.Eastwood's direction seems quite hands off, and the cinematography is washed out and unremarkable. Having seen 'Mystic River', 'Gran Torino' and 'Changeling' fairly recently, it's a shame to see his directing style become a bit lazy, as if he's relaxing into a process rather than really committing himself to the film.I did clock on leaving the cinema that the film might not be for me. I'm not American and I'm not that patriotic. I'm a fairly pacifist person and fundamentally disagreed with Chris Kyle's job. But the way the film is made causes it to live up completely to the joke 'American Propaganda', making the American soldier look like the hero, and any Muslim character instantly a bad person. I was annoyed while watching it because it didn't interest me or emote me, and because I couldn't help but remember that it's nominated for 'Best Picture' at the Oscars and 'Gone Girl' is not. I watched a number of great films last year, and a fair few of them were way better than this.You may really enjoy this film. You may relate to its message or its main character in a way that I could not. You may admire his patriotism and desire to save his country by shooting people who couldn't see him. Unfortunately, I did not.",6,5,19,27 January 2015
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," This is the worst of the Star Wars hexalogy...
","There is no doubt at all in my mind, this is definitely the worst of the Star Wars hexalogy. It still has some great qualities, but on the whole it's pretty uninteresting and overdramatic.Let's begin with the positives. The CGI is still great. Many of the crowd scenes are still incredible to watch, due to their complexity, and it's often hard to believe how much work has gone into the detailing here. You can tell that George Lucas cares most about the visuals, because he animates the smallest things, like a pear when Anakin and Padmé are having a meal together. Most importantly, Yoda is now animated and cooler than ever. Even in Episode I, a strange- looking puppet was being used. Now, however, he looks completely normal and his animated nature allows for cooler fight scenes and awesome jump shots.The acting isn't too bad overall, and Ewan McGregor is really good in this film, but he is let down by others, such as Hayden Christensen. His portrayal of Anakin in the film is so irritating that you do want him just to die as soon as possible, and you don't really care about him at all. His relationship with Padmé (who hasn't really aged since Episode I, while Anakin really has) is very creepy as well. His conversion to the dark side is also quite annoying, with the flip-out that he has after his mother's death being completely unnecessary and over the top. Her death is also really cheesy, with a complete 'head falls back suddenly' collapse.The film is, despite many dark moments, occasionally very humorous (but not C3PO's one liners), and many action sequences are also very cool. Despite its absurdity, I really enjoyed the 'Gladiator'-esque sequence, and how everyone manages to get out of it fairly unharmed. The biggest problem in this film – ignoring of course the ever-present 'Jar Jar Binks' – is the plot, which is fairly pointless and uninteresting. It's very evident too that George Lucas has little skill writing dialogue, let alone romantic dialogue. It is this, perhaps, that makes Anakin's relationship with Padmé so creepy, since they do exchange so many terrible lines.",6,1,3,1 July 2013
21 Jump Street," An enjoyable and self-aware comedy that only occasionally crosses the line...
","Only a few days ago I wrote in this blog that I've said the words 'Channing Tatum? I'm not watching that...' far too many times. As an actor he's limited himself to mindless action films (note 'G.I. Joe') or vomit-inducing chick flicks (don't see 'The Vow'), which are the types of movies which I usually try to distance myself from. When I sat down with the family to watch '21 Jump Street', my hopes weren't that high, but I must confess now that I found him bearable and actually quite funny here. This is an enjoyable and self-aware comedy, with some good performances, that only occasionally crosses the line in terms of crudity.In the film, Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum play cop partners, who went to high-school together and did not get on. Hill was the nerdy kid while Tatum was the handsome jock who bullied him. They meet many years later when both sign up for the police force, and decide that their partnership would allow each to motivate the other. Due to some difficult and hilarious circumstances, the two are punished by being moved to the '21 Jump Street' division and sent undercover into a high-school to investigate a drug problem there. Much of the comedy comes from the two integrating themselves back into school life, accidentally taking each others' fake personalities, and being generally awkward.The cast of the film is very strong, with Jonah Hill's comedic performance being one of the best I've seen him in yet. In the supporting cast, Brie Larson plays a great love interest for Hill's character, and Ice Cube brings some fantastic self-referential humour into the film, about how ridiculous the concept of the '21 Jump Street' operation actually is. The fact that the film knows how implausible most of it is makes it all the more funny throughout. Dave Franco makes for a fairly believable bad guy, but the standout performance in the film goes to Nick Offerman, despite his small screen time, for his deadpan Police Chief, which is utterly hilarious.The film is directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller, who also helmed the first 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' film and 'The LEGO Movie'. As shows in all of these films, their talent as comedic directors is extremely good, and they create a believable world for the characters. The film's greatest problem is that sometimes the jokes don't work, and some go too far. The crude nature of a lot of the film turned me off it slightly, particularly the final gross-out gag at the climax of the film. It doesn't feel particularly necessary, and is just a bit disgusting. It is this brand of comedy that is prominent in the not-so-funny 'Hangover' movies, but thankfully not all of the jokes in this film are based on it. All in all, '21 Jump Street' is a funny and interesting comedy, and despite a few flaws, is incredibly watchable.",7,3,5,3 June 2014
Bridget Jones's Diary," This is occasionally funny, sickly sweet, but does nothing in the way of breaking convention...
","I'm gonna come straight out and say it – I don't really love romcoms. Recent and future entries in this blog may lead you to think otherwise, with both 'Love Actually' and 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' reviewed within days of each other. Actually no, on further thought, I love a lot of romcoms. The classics, like 'Some Like it Hot' or 'Manhattan', or recent subversions of the genre, such as '(500) Days of Summer' and 'Punch Drunk Love', are films which I admire greatly despite being in this genre. These are the films which either began the clichés in an unforced and genuinely romantic way, or which turned the conventions on their heads. 'Bridget Jones's Diary' is occasionally funny, sickly sweet, but does nothing in the way of breaking convention.The film follows the title character, played by Renée Zellweger, and her search for love with a few different men – including those played by Hugh Grant and Colin Firth. Her impressions of the two change throughout the film as she gets new information, with her love for Daniel Cleaver (Grant) turning into hatred after he cheats on her, and her hatred for Mark Darcy (Firth) turning into love. She is a clumsy woman, prone to faux-pas, which leads to some interesting and witty comedy, and often leaves her unlucky in love.Renée Zellweger is a good choice for Jones, and she passes off a sense of 'ordinary' which is important for the character. The comic set pieces and dialogue is managed well by her and she is actually a very likable character. Colin Firth also brings across the bumbling British romantic well, and despite their initial hatred for each other, you see how the two work as a couple. The biggest problem is Hugh Grant, who I continue to dislike strongly. Having seen this and 'Four Weddings' in such close proximity, it's hard not to draw comparisons between their characters, basically the same in both.'Bridget Jones's Diary' has a lot of great things in some cast choices, and some excellently funny moments. The fight scene between the two men is genuinely funny, and I love many of Zellweger's scenes, particularly her terrible public speaking. Where it falls down is at the bare romance and reliance on genre clichés. It's too predictable and from the introduction of both men, we know which one she's going to fall for. The one grace in this is that, despite its cheese, the final scene is very sweet. It's not a particularly clever film, but then again, it's not trying to be. I didn't love it, but I'm sure that fans of this genre will – especially if they take a particular fancy to Hugh Grant.",6,0,0,1 June 2014
Fargo," In anyone else's hands, 'Fargo' would be a very ordinary movie. Thank god for the Coen Brothers...
","The best movies are the ones that not only tell a good story, but make you think about yourself. They can be inspirational stories that make us strive to be better, or cautionary tales to make us more aware of things to look out for in life. Alternatively, they can make us think about who we really are – this is where 'Fargo' comes in. In anyone else's hands, 'Fargo' would be a very ordinary movie, telling the story of a series of crimes and a detective who tries to solve them. In the hands of the Coen Brothers, it's a gory and often hilarious look at criminal life in cold Minnesota, and the oddball characters involved in it.The focus for the first third of the film is Jerry Lundegaard, a car salesman played superbly by William H. Macy, who is in need of money, and hires two criminals (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife so that he can take some of the ransom money. He's a brilliantly written character, who gets far too nervous in the tricky situations he's stuck in, and always tries to recover as things don't go his way. As things go wrong for the criminals they are forced to kill a number of witnesses, which gives them even more problems. This brings in the film's main character, pregnant Police Chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand), who is calm and polite in her investigations and fascinating to watch. McDormand manages to steal the show brilliantly, with her awkward facial expressions at times and perfectly placed one-liners at others. It's difficult to see anyone else playing the role.The script of the film is so sharp, but it's rare that the Coen Brothers don't deliver that for us. Why does the film make you think about yourself though? Because of its violence and the way you react to it. When Jerry's wife is being kidnapped, she hides in the shower and then runs along the hall unable to escape from the shower curtain, eventually falling down the stairs. It's brutal, but it's so ridiculous and so well shot that it's also kind of funny. The criminals, especially Buscemi's character, are so idiotic that their mishaps, including Buscemi being shot in the face, also make you laugh. The thing that really makes all of this click is the setting, the wintry town of Fargo, its bizarre residents and particularly the accent. There is one scene where Marge only says 'Yah', but does it in such a way that it can't help being funny. They're ridiculous without being too simple, and constantly watchable.'Fargo' is a relatively brief movie, at only 98 minutes long, but it uses every second to its advantage in painting this brilliant, funny and bizarre story. It shows all of its actors, and its two directors, at their very best, and doesn't let up for one moment so that you are always willing to go along for the ride.",9,0,0,3 September 2014
The Bourne Identity," What makes this so rewarding is that you are equal with the main character...
","When watching a film for the first time, it is necessary to allow yourself to be immersed completely in the story, characters and locations. This is harder if you have no background information, but can be even more rewarding if you commit to it. You learn as the characters do, and you follow their journey. What makes 'The Bourne Identity' so rewarding, therefore, is that for once you are on a complete equal with the main character in terms of information – you learn as he does.The film tells the story of Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), a trained CIA assassin who has had his memory wiped, and is found by a ships' crew, floating unconscious in the sea. Gradually, we learn more about him as he does. He has a great set of skills which only need to be triggered to be used. He has a swiss bank account with a large number of passports, all in different names. After the CIA is notified as to Bourne's whereabouts, they send people to track him down, so he's constantly on the run. Damon is a really fantastic actor, and plays Bourne in a serious yet connectable way. Franka Potente also does a great job as Bourne's love interest Marie, and the chemistry between the two is a really fantastic part of the film.One of the biggest problems with spy films in this day and age is the endless comparison with James Bond, and the need to be different. This is where the film succeeds so well. It's got gadgets, action, the girl, but treats them in a very different way. It's more realistic, the technology is ever present yet not futuristic, and the action sequences are far more stylised and extremely engaging. The fight sequences are gripping and the way they are shot reminds you of a martial arts film. The chase sequences are frantic and more intimate. And it's far bleaker than a James Bond film, more personal, and this is possibly all down to Damon's fantastic character.The main problem with the film is its plot, which is at time difficult to follow, however the brilliance of the action sequences often makes up for this. It's a watchable and enjoyable film, with a lot of promise leading into the next instalments in the trilogy.",8,0,1,26 February 2014
Man of Steel," If you're a Christopher Nolan fan, bad news...
","If you're a Zack Snyder fan, good news! Man of Steel is among his best work, with some 'Zack Snyder'-y action and violence. If you're a Christopher Nolan fan, bad news! Man of Steel feels like a poor attempt to mimic the success of the 'Dark Knight' trilogy.The main problem with it is the plot. It's just not a very fun movie. Even 'The Dark Knight' has a few laughs or clever lines, but in MoS, I think I only laughed once towards the end. The fight scenes are overlong too, and become a bit dull and monotonous after a while. The film is trying to be another gritty superhero film, like so many that have come out recently, and unfortunately that's all it is. Trying. It never succeeds in engaging the audience fully. On a more positive note, I did enjoy some of the backstory, and thought that this could have been more prominent. Superman's rescue of the school bus is one of the few completely enjoyable scenes, and Kevin Costner is especially good as his adoptive father. And of course, this wouldn't be a real superhero film without the life-changing death of a parent or guardian. And Superman does lose his father. Twice.The other problem is the style of the film, everything is washed out and a bit grey, and the camera-work is annoying. Snyder films it in such a way that it's an effort to actually see anything, because everything is shaky, even if it's just two people having a conversation. Hans Zimmer's score is far too loud and intrusive too (his scores for 'The Dark Knight ' and 'Inception' are just about bearable), and this means that all of the action and explosions have to be even louder. You leave the film with a very apparent deafness.One of the few redeeming features of the film is the acting, which is occasionally very good. Amy Adams plays Lois Lane very well, and she delivers the finest performance in the film by far. Cavill plays a convincing Superman, and Russell Crowe's Jor-El, despite his early death, is quite fun in his 'digital form'. I did laugh out loud when he closed a door on one of Zod's accomplices by moving his hand. I don't think this was written to be humorous though.As a movie, it's not a bad one. It has fairly good action sequences and a nice backstory for Superman. It's well acted in places. As a movie that is selling itself using the Christopher Nolan name, it's disappointing and nowhere near any of his previous work. Thankfully, he says that he gave most creative control to Snyder, so we're still able to look forward to 'Interstellar' next year.",6,3,7,3 July 2013
Little Miss Sunshine," Not just a razor-sharp script, but also a fantastic set of performances...
","It's surprising how much the success of an ensemble comedy depends on each individual member's contribution to the film. It's all about actors working together and riffing off each other, and one weak link can spoil an otherwise good premise for a film. 'Little Miss Sunshine' not only benefits greatly from its razor-sharp script, but also a fantastic set of characters and performances, which complement each other perfectly. The production side of the film is made up of newcomers, director team Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, and first-time writer Michael Arndt (who later wrote 'Toy Story 3″).The film never feels like a first-time effort, though, and this again is down to the cast, made up of experienced actors like Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette. Even Abigail Breslin had been acting for 4 years when she made this film. Steve Carrell delivers the funniest performance of the film, and also manages to bring a great deal of drama to his role. Paul Dano manages to make his appearances in the first half deep, despite his complete silence throughout. This silence does build up to one of the film's best moments, when we finally hear is character, Dwayne, speak in a loud, sweary outburst.The film follows the path of a basic road-trip movie. A family are trying to get from A to B (which here takes the form of a beauty pageant), while they drift apart and reconnect with each other. It's a film more about character relationships than a formal story at times. The humour of the film comes from running jokes and set pieces, which are frequent and constantly funny. It's very cleverly done, and no scene is unimportant, as most add to a joke found later on in the film. The best scene in the film comes from a great ensemble at the hospital, just after Alan Arkin's character has died. The family need to smuggle his body out of the hospital so that they can get to the pageant on time. This scene in particular, which begins very seriously and dramatically, shows how well written the film is, as it manages to go from deeply emotional to laugh-out-loud funny in a matter of seconds.The end to the film is extremely satisfying, a tough feat to pull off in a comedy, where many can feel unfulfilled or abrupt, and Olive's appearance at the beauty pageant, which the whole movie has built up to, is extremely well done and really funny. Altogether, it's a heart-warming and hilarious movie, making you care for the characters just as much as it makes you laugh.",9,2,3,26 October 2013
The Shining," This is both terrifying and surreal, but not too much to make it unwatchable...
","I generally tend to steer clear of the 'horror' genre, because it's not really something that appeals to me. The concept of the 'Saw' films is something that disgusts me, and I don't quite understand the appeal. The only foray I've made into the genre is probably 'Psycho', which still has scary moments but is not overly terrifying. It was with some apprehension, therefore, that I purchased a copy of 'The Shining' and decided to sit down to watch it, not really knowing what to expect. Thankfully, I enjoyed it immensely, finding it both terrifying and surreal, but not too much to make it unwatchable.The film stars Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance, a man hired as caretaker in a strange and isolated hotel during the winter months. A previous caretaker of the hotel went mad and murdered his family, but this does not affect Torrance, and he comes to the hotel with his wife and son, played by Shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyd. His son has supernatural powers which give him visions and premonitions, and some of these visions provide for thrilling viewing, including the iconic image of the two girls in the corridor. Over the course of the film, Torrance goes steadily madder and ends up trying to murder his family. The film gets more bizarre as it progresses, with imagery becoming more surreal and events getting scarier. Among these interesting and bizarre things are the strangely crowded hotel bar, the blood pouring from the lift, and the final shot of the film.The film's overall pacing is quite steady, and Kubrick allows for a lot of build up until Jack actually goes 'axe-murderer' mad. However it is not uninteresting, and a lot of focus is put on the eerie hotel and how it affects the characters. Nicholson's performance is fantastic and incredibly creepy. We aren't too sure what to make of Torrance from the outset, and Nicholson makes him a fascinating person to watch. Duvall is occasionally quite annoying as the constantly crying victim of her husband's rampage, but it doesn't jar too much. Kubrick has a fantastic visual eye for the film, helping the pacing to be slow and subtle. The moving shots which follow the tricycle, the symmetrical corridors or vivid colours used all help to give the hotel an unearthly quality, making the eventual actions scarier. It's occasionally hard to follow, because some things don't make any sense, but it doesn't feel too confusing because the world of the film doesn't make much sense in nature.And yes, it is a scary movie. There are a lot of really creepy scenes, such as one shared between Nicholson and a lady in a bathtub, and a lot of outright terrifying moments. The chase scenes and Nicholson's now famous axing down of the bathroom door put your heart right in your mouth, and are completely gripping. There are also a few jumps, but these don't feel gratuitous, and simply help to add to the excitement of the film. With 'The Shining', Stanley Kubrick created a deep-thinking horror film which manages both to creep out its viewers, and give them an enjoyable time watching it.",9,2,4,3 June 2014
The Lego Movie," I wrote this off as another attempt to sell a product. How wrong I was...
","Two lists I want to bring to your attention on Wikipedia: Movies based on Video Games and, more relevant here, Movies based on Toys. If you look at the films on these lists and look for their Rotten Tomatoes scores, you will notice that very few are rated 'Fresh' - a startlingly low number, in fact. Why is this? I think this is because video games and toys often don't have plots that translate well to films, because they involve you doing things to them, and not characters as much. I will accept that video games are now a bit different, and that many are now far more plot based, but this was certainly the case in the past. When I first found out about 'The LEGO Movie', I very quickly wrote it off as another attempt to sell a product within a shoddy plot framework. Thank goodness I was unbelievably wrong.'The LEGO Movie' is funny, intelligent and exciting for the entirety of its runtime, and so many elements contribute to its outstanding success. The film tells the story of standard mini-figure Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt), who teams up with the 'Master Builders' in order to save the universe from the evil Lord Business (Will Ferrell). In that simple form, it's an ordinary 'chosen one' plot line, but the writing and details ensure that it's anything but ordinary. Along the way, Emmet meets a host of different Lego characters, including the blind wizard Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) and many superheroes (Will Arnett's Batman is particularly great), and they travel through loads of different Lego landscapes on their quest.You're probably still not sold on it, which is understandable - the film's plot isn't really its greatest quality. What makes this film so great is the writing and animation, both of a consistently high quality throughout. Everything in the animation is made of Lego, and is therefore animated like Lego. It's incredibly detailed, and through this you notice charming details throughout that make you appreciate just how much care has gone into the film. The visuals are great, and are the main thing that young kids will appreciate. The reason adults will see it is for the humour. I found myself laughing far more than my 6 year old cousin, and that's because it's written with the adults in mind. The song 'Everything is Awesome', the ridiculous 'follow the rules' state that Emmet lives in, the references to Lego of the past, characters such as Liam Neeson's Good Cop/Bad Cop and the noticeable cameos are all things which adults will love and appreciate. The real genius of the film is that it appeals so easily to both age groups.'The LEGO Movie' had the potential to be something so much worse. It could have been a thoughtless attempt to sell more Lego by constructing a shoddy, uninteresting plot around some bland characters (c.f. Transformers), but enough love and attention has gone into the film that you can't help but enjoy it. Phil Lord and Chris Miller, from '21 Jump Street' and 'Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs' fame, are the perfect people to helm this film, with their irreverent and sharp sense of humour, especially visual humour. With a final quarter that is both surprising and poignant, this is undoubtedly a film that will touch adults and children alike, and leave them 100% satisfied.",9,0,4,2 September 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," Both fascinating and horrifying, but ultimately flawed in its execution...
","It's Oscar season, and therefore biopic season. So far this Oscar season, I've seen the two true stories: '12 Years a Slave' and 'Captain Phillips', both told in extremely different ways. One is a subtle and frequently brutal drama, the other is a gripping thriller. So add to this line up 'Dallas Buyers Club', a heartfelt, occasionally witty drama about a man who is suffering from AIDS and decides to make some money out of curing the disease. It's an odd set of films to say the very least, and I'm not entirely sure whether this really fits in there. It is both fascinating and horrifying at times, but is ultimately flawed in its execution.Matthew McConaghey stars as Ron Woodruff, a foul and debauched rodeo cowboy, who suddenly discovers that he is suffering from HIV/AIDS and is given 30 days to live. Unhappy with the medicine available and its effects, he decides to import foreign drugs illegally for both his own personal use, and to sell to others for profit. The man is clearly a genius, constantly finding loopholes and managing to keep the business going, saving a great number of lives. His friendship with Rayon, played by a cross-dressing Jared Leto, is the most interesting part of the film, since Woodruff is originally extremely homophobic and hates the association he gets with the gay people he is saving. He eventually becomes a great friend to Rayon, and their closeness as friends becomes very apparent towards the film's ending.The performances in the film are stunning, and it is not just McConaghey's weight loss that needs commenting on, even though it is absolutely incredible. Woodruff is portrayed as the perfect anti-hero, saving people's lives but originally for the wrong reasons. I couldn't help but be reminded of Oskar Schindler, a business man like Woodruff who realised his power and saved thousands of Jews. However Woodruff is far more, because he is originally completely foul and offensive to the people that he would eventually go on to save. Jennifer Garner gives undoubtedly the best performance I have ever seen her in, and there is a scene that I don't want to spoil towards the film's end which is completely believable and heartfelt on her part.Despite all of these great things the film does have its flaws, and like so many films these days, the running time is the main problem. It lasts just under 2 hours, and drags at times where not a lot is happening. The best parts of the film are the more interesting exchanges, and when the plot is static and we're not learning anything new, it feels overly padded. I didn't come out of the film feeling like I'd just experienced an incredible film, but just an interesting story with good characters and fine acting. A small part of me feels cheated that this is up for Best Picture, but 'Inside Llewyn Davis' isn't.But these are merely initial reactions to what was on the whole an enjoyable film, and I do recommend it anyway, if only because Matthew McConaghey's performance is one of his finest, and it's an interesting look into one small part of such a poorly documented time in modern American history.",8,2,2,11 February 2014
The Usual Suspects," This provides one of the most incredible payoffs in cinema...
","An incredible twist is enough to propel any film into greatness, even if it's not an incredible movie. People can have their opinions of a film completely changed just because of a cunning twist at the end, even if the rest of it is unremarkable. It is therefore crucial when reviewing a film of this nature that all of the movie is taken into account, not just the ending. Thankfully, 'The Usual Suspects' is completely worth the journey to the end, earning its runtime with funny and thrilling cinema, and providing one of the most incredible payoffs at the end. For those who haven't seen the film, I will attempt to keep this as spoiler-free as possible, but I can't promise anything.The film is told mostly via flashback by Kevin Spacey's character, the odd 'Verbal' Kint, about a group of criminals who are brought together by the mysterious crime boss Keyser Soze. They get into deeper and deeper trouble throughout the film, only meeting Soze's strange associate, 'Mr Kobayashi', played masterfully and mysteriously by the late Pete Postlethwaite. The ensemble, made up of Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne and Benicio del Toro, among others, has incredible chemistry, and you believe every one of the fights and fall-outs that they have. The whole point is that they're being forced to work together, it's not their choice.The film is an excellent example of neo-noir styling, especially in its cinematography and score, and the climax on the ship at the end is pulled off extremely well. It's a truly heart- pounding sequence, helped by the fact that you're manically trying to unpick the mystery at the same time. What makes it such a success is the fact that nearly all of the preceding hour and a half is interesting and engaging. The characters are well thought out, not just one-sided, and the performances on display really complement each other well.*SPOILERS FROM HERE*Is it perfect? Almost. It's inevitable that putting so much reliance on a twist can scupper parts of the film's success, and despite taking you completely by surprise, it does in many ways completely invalidate everything seen before. Obviously the true test of this is whether it stands up a second time, once you know the twist, but I have yet to experience this. An unreliable narrator is okay so long as you can piece together some form of truth afterwards, and I'm really not sure if this is possible.Despite this, the first watching certainly holds up. You're taking on an incredible ride with the film, constantly trying to guess its secrets, and if anything, it's a brilliant way to experience one of Spacey's two breakout performances.",9,0,0,6 January 2015
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," This doesn't suffer from feeling drawn out, and is even better than the first part.
","The second part of a trilogy can often be the hardest to get right. By this stage you've had your beginning, and you know your eventual outcome, so the second instalment is merely a task in setting each character up to be in the right place for the third. 'Back to the Future: Part 2' and 'The Empire Strikes Back' are both great examples of films which have this task, but do it well enough that the film could be watched as a standalone movie, since they are both exciting enough to keep the viewer interested. 'The Two Towers', the second part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, slightly fails in this respect as it feels very drawn out and uninteresting, as if it is just setting up for 'Return of the King'. Luckily, 'The Desolation of Smaug' does not suffer from this at all, and is even better than the first part of this trilogy.We pick up right where 'An Unexpected Journey' left off, with the group of dwarfs and Bilbo (Martin Freeman) escaping from the Orcs with whom they had fought at the very end. Over the course of the film, the group travel towards, and eventually into, the Lonely Mountain, where the dragon Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch) is sleeping. This is no easy journey for them, however, and on the way they encounter spiders, Elves (which sees a return of Orlando Bloom's Legolas) and Men, each of whom is some kind of hindrance to their quest. When they eventually reach and enter the Mountain, they are tasked with trying to steal the Arkenstone from Smaug, which doesn't quite go as they expected.These different encounters usually involve an escape, and it is here when the film is most exciting, as there is often a lot of chaotic action going on. the use of CGI in the film is extremely prominent, and works very well in continuing the magical image of Middle Earth from the first film. Much like how the greatest part of the first film was Bilbo talking to the CGI Gollum, this film's best scene is an exchange between Bilbo and Smaug. Martin Freeman's talent is clearly on show here, as he acts masterfully in trying to find and steal the Arkenstone without waking the dragon.As is slightly traditional with the second parts of trilogies, this film is noticeably darker than its predecessor, with Gandalf's storyline at the tombs taking an extremely dark tone. The ensemble cast continues to work so well with each other, and the group dynamic is one of the things which makes the film more enjoyable as an audience. Again, the film suffers from its own length, but not as much as the first film, since there are more interesting things going on here and less exposition. And while the film ends with an annoying cliffhanger, it's really the only way it should - with everything headed for disaster, and the audience wondering how on earth they're going to get out of it. It's immensely enjoyable, and I really can't wait for the third part.",8,0,1,30 May 2014
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," This has extremely high standard to live up to, but provides a satisfying start to this new trilogy...
","The 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy is one of the highest regarded movie series that currently exists – that's undeniable. The movies won Oscars, placed highly in critics 'Best of' lists, and made millions of dollars. Personally, I wasn't the biggest fan of them, their run times or the extended fight scenes, but I thought they were well acted and visually stunning. With this already set in place then, 'The Hobbit' trilogy has an extremely high standard to live up to, so that it doesn't feel like it's cashing in on a successful franchise. Thankfully, it doesn't, and thanks to more great acting and breathtaking visuals, 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' provides a satisfying start to this new trilogy.Martin Freeman plays Bilbo Baggins, who was previously portrayed by Ian Holm in the original trilogy, and he takes up the character extremely easily, making him likable and interesting. Ian McKellen's Gandalf is, as always, a treat to watch, and he is a great authority figure for the unruly band of dwarfs that he is accompanying. Throughout the film, they get into many twists and traps, and some of the most exciting parts of the film are when the group are running away from things. Due to the incredible CGI landscapes, many parts feel like a video game that you're watching, but this is not a criticism. It's got excitement to it, and because of the plot, we find it more interesting than just a video game. Peter Jackson's vision from the originals carries through seamlessly, and he knows how to make visuals work in an intriguing and captivating way.The greatest part of the film is kept for the final third, where Bilbo meets one of the best characters from the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy – Gollum. Andy Serkis returns in full motion- capture glory, and there is an incredible chemistry between him and Freeman as they exchange riddles. The introduction of the ring is crucial here, and Jackson shoots the scene so that we can feel both its humour and its importance to the story.Because it's the start of a new trilogy, which will probably eventually run to a length of about 8 hours, there needs to be lots of exposition. We find out who the dwarfs are, where they're going, why they need Bilbo, and so many other things. At times, the film can feel weighed down with all the information that it has to convey. At 169 minutes, it is undoubtedly too long, like each part of the original trilogy. However it often improves on and retains the feeling of 'Fellowship', which is the best one of the originals. The actual embarking on the journey is very interesting, as are the new characters we're going to be following in the next two parts.The biggest uproar that this trilogy has caused is the fact that such a small book has been split into three parts, and despite the fact that this film is too long, as the next two parts will probably be, I'm okay with the decision. There's a lot of story to tell in 'The Hobbit', and with Jackson at the helm, there's no doubt that it will feel mostly secure.",8,1,3,14 April 2014
Before Sunset," Nine years have passed, but Jesse and Céline are as talkative as ever...
","Nine years have passed, but Jesse and Céline are as talkative as ever when they reunite in 'Before Sunset'. He's written a (partly fictional) book about the night that he shared with Céline in Vienna, and she comes to see him on his book tour in Paris. They only have 80 minutes together until he has to catch a plane back, so they continue where they left off – they walk and talk. Having re-watched 'Midnight in Paris' so recently, it's easy to see differences in Allen and Linklater's styles. Allen is so much more focused on showing the audience Paris and the great things in it, while Linklater focuses on what he considers to be more important – the endless conversation of Jesse and Céline. This doesn't mean that we don't get a small glimpse of the city, and the backgrounds to their walk are frequently stunning. They even get on a riverboat at one point, so we get even more of the city through this.The film is slightly shorter than the first one, but feels like the perfect length, because it's done entirely in real time. Their walk around Paris is unabridged for the viewer, so we never feel like we've missed anything. It's as sharp and funny as ever, but this time with more emotions. They didn't end up meeting 6 months after 'Before Sunrise', and there's some pain between them. To change matters even more, Jesse is now married and has a child. We're never really sure what this means for the two of them, but desperately want them to end up together. Once again, the two of them only have a limited amount of time together, and both know it, so they don't hold back at all, discussing everything under the sun. In the end, just before Jesse must leave, they go up to Céline's apartment. This final scene is one of the greatest endings to any film I know, and has an even more infuriating cliffhanger than the end of the first film. Julie Delpy's Nina Simone impression is fantastic, and the final line and fade out is done so perfectly.The performances in the film are perhaps even stronger than in 'Before Sunrise', as we are given more of a view into the emotional ranges of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. They're occasionally angry and sad now, not just happy and in love. The two are credited in this film as co-writers with Richard Linklater, which helps the film so much, as they know their characters inside out. Linklater's style continues in this film, with more long shots, and the use of real time allows him just to follow them. The cinematography feels passive to the idle viewer, but lots of the angles and shots are done very beautifully. It's the perfect continuation of the love story, and one of the few sequels that is as good as the first film.",9,0,0,31 October 2013
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," A film that doesn't know what it wants to be...
","'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' is a reboot/prequel to the 1968 classic 'Planet of the Apes', and the main problem with the film is that it doesn't quite know which of those two things it wants to be. If it's a prequel, then it contains a good backstory for why the earth becomes overrun with apes, but falls at the hurdle of having a time setting that is completely different to the original. It's also got monkeys that look completely different, and the fact that it's too modern means that it can't really function well as a prequel.If it's a reboot of the franchise, which is what it's intended to be, then we encounter major problems in terms of both story and enjoyability. The film's greatest strength and weakness is its exposition, which is interesting and sets up a great reason as to why a drug is created that ends up changing the apes like this. The sudden hyper intelligence created in apes while finding a cure for Alzheimer's is a fantastic idea, and also allows the writers to deal with the problems of animal testing and cruelty.The problem is that the whole film is based around this, and there's barely any middle or end. The whole film feels like exposition, and this hinders it completely as a standalone film. It's a prequel without the main event, like seeing 'X-men Origins: Wolverine' before seeing the others. It's mostly built on backstory, but we don't know what this is supposed to be the backstory for. A few recent reboots have done this, such as 'Batman Begins', but it works in that case, because the rest of the film is so interesting. The final battle scene doesn't even end with the overrunning of the earth, but a peaceful harmony between humans and apes.That said, James Franco plays a great lead character and Andy Serkis' performance as Caesar, the monkey, is fantastic, proving that motion capture acting is still real acting. Occasionally the quality of the animation slips and the monkeys look less realistic in closeups than in crowd shots. One interesting thing that the film raises is the identity of the villain. As humans, we are trained to see ourselves as the good guys, but for some reason we empathise and cheer for the monkeys' success at numerous points because we see how badly they have been treated by humanity. It is entirely possible that this film will make a lot more sense and be better overall when the next instalment comes out, but until then, it's a film with too much beginning and not enough middle or end, making it mostly unsatisfying and uninteresting.",6,0,2,26 August 2013
JFK," Does 'JFK' work as an interesting film, not just a politics lesson? Kind of...
","There are a lot of problems that can be faced when making deeply political movies. Filmmakers try to share their views on corrupt systems and political mistakes, but through this they ignore the one thing that is most essential in an interesting film - the plot. There's a fine line between a fascinating thriller and a politics lesson, and occasionally directors will fall on the wrong side of that line. This has never stopped Oliver Stone, however, who has now built up a reputation for dealing with tricky subject matters, such as the Vietnam War, 9/11 or various presidents, in his movies. Here, he tackles the topic of JFK's assassination in a 3 hour movie which addresses as many conspiracy theories that it can. Does it work? Kind of.The movie follows Jim Garrison, played by Kevin Costner, the District Attorney of New Orleans who begins to look into the JFK assassination, since he is convinced that Lee Harvey Oswald could not have been the only killer. It begins by showing Kennedy's life just before his killing, through newsreel footage, building up to a reconstruction of the actual assassination. The film is intelligent in using this as exposition rather than a major plot point later, since it is such a familiar event, and we can then get right into the fallout. Various theories are debunked and brought up during the course of the film, including a scene where Garrison tests out whether it was actually possible for Oswald to have hit Kennedy from his supposed position at the time.The acting in the film is mostly superb, with Costner being a likable lead who is also a powerful speaker. The speech that he gives during the court case right at the end is long, but he is a good enough orator that you focus on everything he says. Other great members of the cast include Tommy Lee Jones, playing Clay Shaw, a man accused of conspiring to kill Kennedy, Donald Sutherland, a man high up in Washington who suggests that the CIA had something to do with it, and Jack Lemmon. Kevin Bacon's performance seems like more of a caricature, and is slightly out of place in the film.'JFK' is a fascinating and often thrilling movie at its best points. But it tends to drag when interesting information is not being discovered, and there is no way that all of its 3 hour runtime is necessary. Certain parts feel gratuitous so that every theory is covered, and others are just a bit confusing. There is also the important question of whether it matters if everything in the film is factual. So long as audience members know that it is supposed to be a representation of possible events, rather than stone cold fact, then this does not matter that much, since it is interesting enough as a movie, and at no point claims to be a documentary.If you're going to watch 'JFK', know that you're in for the long haul, and that some parts of the film are not easy to get through because they do drag. However often Costner's performance alone is great enough that interest levels are maintained in the telling if a story which is still shrouded in so much mystery.",8,0,7,5 June 2014
The Theory of Everything," A very moving biopic, with two outstanding performances...
","The greatest difficulty in making a film about someone with a disability is ensuring that you don't let the disability take over the film. It's so easy for a movie to say 'oh dear, look at how much of a struggle having this disability is' without having any other grounding or message, and a lack of fully developed characters. I was extremely surprised, therefore to see exactly how 'The Theory of Everything' deals with Professor Stephen Hawking's motor neurone disease. Inevitably, it portrays his continual physical decline and how he deals with it, but this isn't the point of the film. The film's focus is a relationship between a man and a woman in love, and how they go through struggles together. It's very moving, mostly thanks to two outstanding performances from its leads.'The Theory of Everything' follows the life of Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) from his Cambridge days to the publication of his world-famous book 'A Brief History of Time'. It doesn't waste any time at the start, introducing in the very first scene the beginning of Stephen and Lucy's (Felicity Jones) relationship – this is to become our primary focus for the next two hours. Sure, its introductory shot is of Stephen riding a bike, which slightly feels like a 'he won't be able to do that soon' kind of shot, but it doesn't dwell too much. We are shown just how intelligent Hawking is, and the great romance that lies between him and Lucy, but then the crushing blow comes – he is diagnosed with the disease that he will be identified with for the rest of his life.Where this film succeeds most is showing the effects of the disability on Stephen and his work and his relationship. Enter Jonathan Jones, whom Lucy meets at her church and who starts to look after the family despite him and Lucy having feelings for each other. You can see clearly how their relationship is often strained, how they make life difficult for each other at times, and the two actors work together so well on this. So much has been and will be said about Redmayne's exquisite portrayal of Hawking, picking up every physical and vocal nuance that he has (although I'm sure that, had this not been en pointe, no film would have been made), but it is the relationship and chemistry that is the real highlight of the film. Felicity Jones is just incredible as Lucy, showing both emotional pain and extreme resilience throughout, and it's thanks to her that the film can be so heartbreaking at times.My slight issue with the film came from the amount that it attempts to cram into 2 hours, something which is extremely understandable given the subject matter. We cover the space of 25 years in that time, and sometimes we're flying and other times crawling through those years. There is a period where his physics career seems to be put aside entirely, and it's a slight shame that we do lose that focus, but I suppose it allows us to get the 'snapshots of a relationship' feel that it's going for.If anything, the film makes you marvel at the courage and determination of its two main characters, one of whom defies all odds put against him, and the other who makes it her duty to stand by him every step of the way. The film is, very simply, charming, and is a masterclass in portraying a difficult relationship even more than in portraying a challenging physical illness.",9,0,0,9 February 2015
Hero," 'Hero' is my introduction to the genre, and not a bad film to start with at all...
","I should probably admit first off that the 'martial arts' film genre is one that is very new to me. In fact, Chinese cinema itself is something that I haven't properly experienced before. Therefore, 'Hero' was my introduction into both of these genres, and to be honest, it's not a bad film to start with at all. It's highly stylised, beautifully shot, and has some fantastic action sequences. It's also got a really interesting narrative technique, presenting three different accounts of the same story, which is both unusual and very effective.The movie is set in ancient China, when the country was divided into warring states. It stars Jet Li as 'Nameless', a hero who visits the king of the 'Qin' state claiming to have killed three assassins who have previously made an attempt on the king's life. For the first third of the film, we see flashbacks to these killings as Nameless tells his story to the king. These flashbacks contain some great fight scenes – it's all very over the top, but things like the occasional use of slow motion don't feel at all unnecessary, and it keeps you interested. The king doesn't trust Nameless' story, and gives his own view on what really happened, and following this, Nameless gives him the truth. The narrative technique is really fascinating, and it never really feels like we're getting the same story told to us three times, since each time is visually and narratively different. The film ends with a final great fight scene, and an interesting moral question that is posed by Nameless' actions.The thing that makes the film so beautiful and captivating is Yimou Zhang's use of colour and imagery. When the fight takes place in the chess hall, everything around is black or grey, and later on he fills whole scenes with just whites, reds or blues. Each scene is like a painting, and everything is visually stunning. The scale of the film is also incredible, with huge crowd scenes and amazing visual effects. The scene where Nameless and Broken Sword are fighting on the perfectly still lake is both awe-inspiring and exciting. At times it's more like ballet than fighting, and I think the blurred line between them is what makes the film so exquisite.If you've never seen a martial arts film before, 'Hero' is a great place to start. The one problem I had with the film was due to my viewing it with non-Chinese eyes – there were many cultural references that I didn't understand which slightly marred my overall view of the film. However, it's a stunning film, and worth putting time into.",8,0,0,27 October 2013
The Graduate," If anyone was born to play an awkward 21 year old...
","If anyone was born to play an awkward 21 year old deciding what to do with his life, it has to be 30 year old Dustin Hoffman, who steals this movie with his brilliant portrayal of Benjamin Braddock. It's a performance with humour and emotion all rolled into one. For example, Hoffman's performance when he first takes Mrs. Robinson home is hilarious, with his constant nervous stammering and occasional high-pitched squeaks. The final shot of Elaine and Benjamin has so much drama in both of their expressions, and you can tell how great the pair are as actors. They've just run away together, and she's already married. Are they completely happy? Not really, and both of their faces have a sort of 'now what?' expression, leaving the audience thinking about whether it was the right decision.As for the story itself, it's comical without becoming too farcical, and has enough drama later on to keep the audience interested. It's also beautifully shot, with a lot of clever cutting and images, such as the fact that Benjamin is always being shot through other objects, like the hotel woodwork, or Mrs. Robinson's leg. The music too is great, and Simon and Garfunkel's songs, though some of them are used almost too much, manage to create just the right atmosphere for the film.The late Roger Ebert originally gave this film 4 stars, but thirty years later, dropped his score down to 3, something I'm not sure I've ever heard of a critic doing. He states in his later review that it's not a film that has stood the test of time, that modern audiences wouldn't find it as funny. I disagree with this, and managed to find humour in a lot of the film. However his main reason for doing so is the character of Benjamin, whom he calls an 'insufferable creep', and now I think about it, Ebert is kind of right. Perhaps the awkwardness does go a bit too far at points, and he is just a bit strange and horrible in taking Elaine to the strip club and stalking her for a long time.This detail aside, I still found it to be a hugely enjoyable film which left a lot to think about afterwards, as well as a lot of laughs, and it's worth watching if only for Hoffman's performance and delivery of that classic line: 'Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me, aren't you.'",8,0,0,20 June 2013
Selma," This film isolates an event as an example of the bigger picture...
","Perhaps it shows my broad lack of knowledge about the Civil Rights movement in America, but if I were to make a biopic of Martin Luther King, it would probably contain two important events – the famous 'I Have a Dream' speech, and his eventual assassination. 'Selma' contains neither of those things, and to be honest I was extremely glad that it didn't. Apart from the fact that 'I Have a Dream' is so important and influential that perhaps no other man should perform it, the film succeeds in showing us a single event in the man's career, rather than the entire thing. It isolates this event as an example of his influence and determination, and succeeds as a snapshot which we can easily extrapolate to get a wider idea of the difficulties of the time.In the American South, black people are still unable to vote, despite it being their legal right to do so – they are constantly barred by white officials who make up ridiculous rules so that they can't register. Despite the movement coming on so far, there is still so much work to do, and Martin Luther King is not giving up. He has numerous tense meetings with President Lyndon B. Johnson in which he attempts to get what he wants, but the President isn't budging. In King's mind, there is only one thing to do – travel to Selma, a small town in Alabama, to make an example of how black people are treated. King always knew how to influence people in non-violent ways. He stages marches which he knows will end with black people being treated violently, so that the horrific and brutal scenes are on the front of the national newspapers every single morning.King's tactics are admirable, and it is so incredible to see the extent to which he refuses to be violent or destructive, and always remains extremely calm. The FBI try to break up his relationship with his wife, and there are very moving scenes where the tension between the two of them becomes almost too much, but they are able to stay together despite all of this. In choosing the events in Selma as a case study, we get a glimpse of the much wider picture: not every black person agreed with King's methods (including Malcolm X, who later sided with them); the white population were extremely divided, but many came out in person to support; and most importantly, King was one of the greatest orators of the 20th century. We are shown a few of his sermons at the church in Selma, and the way he speaks is truly inspirational. In this, we are also shown the quality of David Oyelowo's performance, which is so moving and powerful, since he truly believes in what he is saying, and is not just reciting words on a script.The supporting cast of the film is also extremely strong, with special mention going to Carmen Ejogo as Coretta King for her excellent portrayal of their marital struggles. It doesn't take itself too seriously at times, and it's not at all a depressing two hours, despite knowing when it needs to shock. The fact that it only takes place in a short period of time means that it rarely drags, and it constantly wears its message on its sleeve. As well as all of this, it is visually extremely satisfying, with excellent use of imagery and some very beautiful shots. The framing of King's speeches in the church, as an example, is truly perfect.It's a huge shame that Oyelowo doesn't have an Oscar nomination. It is easy to compare this to '12 Years a Slave' since both tackle ideas about race, and in many ways this is a stronger film. Both tackle ideas about resilience and strength of mind, but this makes you care so personally for a much broader range of characters. You root for them throughout, and the final scenes honestly brought me extremely close to tears. It's one of the most powerful films I've seen in a long time, and is a worthy representation of a truly great man.",9,1,2,9 February 2015
There's Something About Mary," I feel no sudden urge now to watch any other Farrelly brothers films...
","I confess that before I watched this, I had not seen any Farrelly brothers films. Not Dumb and Dumber, not Shallow Hal. Nothing. And now that I have witnessed 'There's Something about Mary', I feel no sudden urge to watch any of their other films. I found it frequently disgusting in its source of humour and a bit too over-the-top. Now, you may accuse me of being a film snob, but I didn't dislike it because I only like black and white or foreign films. I don't. I disliked it because its sense of humour was very different to mine, and I have a very broad sense of humour. This would only be a hilarious movie if you find a continual onslaught of rude and disgusting jokes funny. If, after two whole hours, you still find a perverted man with ever- increasing hives funny, this is definitely the film for you. Unfortunately, I don't.And that's another point. This movie, 119 minutes in length, is far too long for the genre of comedy that it's in. There are only so many gross-out jokes you can make, and after about 90 minutes, it all feels a bit monotonous. So, among all of these negative comments, what saves this film from being completely terrible and unfunny? The answer to that is Ben Stiller. Since this film, he has gone on to star in gems like 'Dodgeball' and especially 'Meet the Parents'. In 'There's Something about Mary' we see the foundations to the socially-awkward character which he perfected over the years. He makes a fantastic love-struck teenager, and later on, a great awkward adult. He delivers a lot of his lines in a hilarious way, and he makes most of his scenes completely watchable, unlike many other characters that just make you a bit uncomfortable.There were definitely some jokes that I did like. The entrance of the shrink at the end of the session is really funny, as is the murder of the ever-present guitar player, whose death is very welcome by the end. The overlying sentiment of the film also has some part in its saving, and we do see the true love that exists between Mary and Ted, despite all of the characters around them vying for her love.Overall, it is an unintelligent and often unwatchable farce, but it does have occasional fine moments, which save it from being completely terrible.",6,0,1,3 July 2013
A Beautiful Mind," This is proof of just how good Ron Howard is as a director...
","What criteria should we judge a biopic on? How true to life it is, or how well it works as a standalone movie? I ask because if 'A Beautiful Mind' is judged by the first criterion, it fails pretty badly on many counts. We are provided with a watered down, glammed-up version of the life of John Nash, cutting out many of the 'gory details'. If we take the second criterion, it's a masterpiece, proof (as if we needed it) of how good Ron Howard is as a director, and how well Russell Crowe can act.The movie tells the life story of economist John Nash, whom we first meet when he starts at Princeton. He is socially awkward, bullied in part by his fellow students, and spends all of his time trying to come up with some original work. The only person he seems to get on with is his roommate, played by Paul Bettany, and the two characters spend a lot of great scenes with each other. After Princeton, he works for the US government as a codebreaker and at MIT. He meets Alicia, who goes on to become his wife, but is becoming too infatuated with his 'government work', with Ed Harris' character constantly on his case.I only summarise the plot in this much detail because there is a point, around the hour mark, where we discover that a large portion of it isn't real. John is really a paranoid schizophrenic, and a few of the characters are mere figments of his imagination. I went into the film knowing this in part, and guessed fairly early on that one of the characters wasn't real using 'Sixth Sense' logic (doesn't actually interact with anyone except the delusional character). The other main one completely astounded me. This is even more of a credit to Howard, since he makes the aftermath of the reveal even more interesting and shocking than the reveal itself. One of the great parts of having a fairly early twist is that the rest of the film is very unexpected, and keeps taking you to surprising places. I won't say much more, because going into this film without many spoilers makes it even better.Watching the film, I wondered why Russell Crowe hasn't performed this well in any film recently. He is at the top of his game playing Nash, with fantastic awkwardness, an extremely believable accent, and character traits which seem very well studied. At first glance, he seems to be playing an intelligent Rain Man/Forrest Gump, but there's so much more depth to his performance. The film is a treat to watch, with an astounding cast all round and proof that one day Ron Howard will go down as one of the greatest directors of the 21st century.",10,0,1,27 August 2013
Psycho," One of Hitchcock's very best works, and among Herrmann's finest scores
","Despite being shot in 1960, when colour technology had taken over and was thriving, Alfred Hitchcock decided to shoot his masterpiece 'Psycho' in black and white, in order to keep his budget down. However the black and white adds so much more suspense and mystery to the film, which keeps throwing curveballs at the audience. It tells the story of Marion Crane (at the start anyway), a woman who decides one day to run away with Having done this, she becomes instantly paranoid, convinced that a policeman is following her. While driving off in the rain, she gets panicked, and checks in at a strange motel called 'Bates Motel', inhabited only by a young looking Norman Bates and his mysteriously unseen mother.I don't really want to say more about the plot than that, since it's a film that constantly surprises with its plot. Sure, 90% of people know about the famous 'shower scene' which is still very scary to this day, but what comes after it was very unexpected for me. I had no idea at the 60 minute mark where the film was going to go. Anthony Perkins' performance as the calm looking but psychopathically twisted Norman Bates is a fine one, and there is a lot of depth and evil concealed behind his eyes for most of the film. From the first moment we see him, you are certain he's a killer, he's just got an evil look to him.The set design and cinematography are both fantastic, and the Bates house is particularly creepy standing atop the hill. The opening shot of the cityscape is also great, with the camera gliding over into the hotel room. What really makes this movie so incredible to me is the soundtrack. Bernard Herrmann here provides one of his very best movie scores, with so much menacing, anger and suspense in every cue. The violence of the 'Prelude' music sets the audience up instantly for a thriller, and even though the first 25 minutes are fairly tame, the music keeps returning to remind you that something is coming. Also, the fact that he writes only 4 proper cues which he reuses throughout the whole first 50 minutes is incredible, because they don't seem monotonous, and have a new side to them each time.In short, because I really don't want to give much away, this is an absolute masterpiece, one of Hitchcock's very best works. It's got violence, suspense, drama and thrills, and somehow a lot of depth along with that.",10,1,2,11 July 2013
Love Actually," This is a courageous effort from Richard Curtis, and he just about pulls it off...
","Anthology films, or movies with a lot of different situations and characters, are very difficult to get right, because it is difficult to cram so much information into a 2 hour movie. You've got to make sure that everyone is given enough time to be a completed, three-dimensional character with no rushing, but also ensure that the film doesn't drag. 'Love Actually' is a film made up of many different segments and characters, all of whom are interconnected in some ways. Some characters work really well, some don't work at all, and some are middle ground. It's a courageous effort from writer and director Richard Curtis, and he just about pulls it off.The film follows 10 different sets of people who are romantically involved, or hoping to be, all in the weeks leading up to Christmas. The ensemble cast is enormous, including so many Great British actors like Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Alan Rickman and Liam Neeson, and work together very well. It also contains Hugh Grant, who I have to confess is far more bearable in this film than anything I've ever seen him in before. Grant's Prime Minister is actually well managed, and his door-to-door search at the end is extremely enjoyable. Because the film does so much, I'll briefly talk about a few of the segments which I did really like.The story between Colin Firth and his Portuguese maid is really great, giving Firth the opportunity to play his very amusing bumbling British gentleman again. Their chemistry is truly fantastic, and the final scene when he goes to propose to her in her home town is really funny, especially due to the language barrier. The relationship between Liam Neeson and his son, played by Thomas Sangster, is also extremely sweet and endearing.On the flipside, one of the most beautiful and heartbreaking stories in the film is between Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, who begins an affair with his secretary. Thompson's character starts to suspect things, especially when Rickman buys an expensive gift which doesn't turn out to be for her. The gift is bought from Rowan Atkinson, who steals the entire movie with a brief yet hilarious performance. And when Thompson finally realises the gravity of his affair, she goes to her room and just cries, while Joni Mitchell's 'Both Sides Now' is playing in the background. The emotion Thompson shows here is so raw and genuine, and it's a credit to the film and to Curtis that so many different emotions can be squeezed into 2 hours.Not all of the film works, and Kris Marshall and Martin Freeman's respective segments are a bit crude and gratuitous, adding little to the overall humour of the film. Bill Nighy's ageing rock- star is also quite dislikable, and spends far too much time on screen. It's not a work of genius, but it is fun and incredibly sweet, and to be honest I rather enjoyed it. It's also very Christmassy, and the perfect thing to get you in the festive mood (when that eventually rolls around again).",7,1,2,2 June 2014
12 Years a Slave," This is one of the most difficult films I've had to watch, but is filled with phenomenal performances...
","Some films have subject matters which are tricky to watch but important to know about. 'Schindler's List' is by no means a film that you come out of and think 'I really loved that', but it gets its message across effectively and is emotionally rewarding. In that film particularly, realism is key, and Spielberg doesn't hold back in images of brutality. '12 Years a Slave' is even more horrific at times and one of the most difficult films I've had to watch in a while, but it conveys important messages about racism and slavery, and thanks to its phenomenal performances, makes you relate so much to its characters.The film follows Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free man who is kidnapped and taken into slavery. He fights for years to prove his innocence, while working under numerous cruel masters, including those played by Paul Dano and Michael Fassbender. One of the film's successes is in not creating a clear divide between black and white, with Benedict Cumberbatch and Brad Pitt both playing characters who support and are kind to Solomon. But under Fassbender's character, Edwin Epps, he is beaten often, as is Patsey, played by Lupita Nyong'o.The performances in the film are all brilliant, especially those of Ejiofor and Nyong'o, who convey pain and suffering like I have never seen before on screen. They are both convincing and don't overstate it, which is what makes the characters so successful. You feel every minute of Solomon's journey, and he makes you root for him so much. The film's brutality is one of its most important parts, and occasionally you have to look away due to the sheer extremity of it all, but the fact that nothing is held back adds a sense of reality to it. The scars on Patsey's back after she has been lashed repeatedly are horrible to see, but send such an important message.Steve McQueen shoots the film in a very artistic way, with lots of lingering shots on the beauty of the New Orleans country side. However he knows where to focus his camera during the more painful scenes to make them even stronger. A single extended shot, which runs for probably 2 minutes but feels like ages, shows Solomon tiptoeing around in some mud while hung up by his neck. The camera does not move, and you just hear the sounds of his throat clicking as he gasps for breath. It's difficult to witness, and goes on just a bit too long, but again this cruelty is important to the story, because it makes the audience think. It also makes the ending, which is filled with so much emotion, a whole lot more rewarding because we have seen and can understand everything that these characters have been through.'12 Years a Slave' is an utterly unique movie. It has moments which are so difficult to watch, and perhaps it is important for audiences to know what they're getting in for before they watch this, but the stunning performances and breathtaking cinematography help to make it a rewarding and thought provoking experience.",9,0,1,5 June 2014
Whiplash," There is an astounding and intense story at the heart of 'Whiplash'...
","Teachers in films can be placed into two categories. On the one hand, you have your John Keatings (from Peter Weir's 'Dead Poets Society'), who are kind, think-outside-the-box teachers who unlock parts of their students minds and inspire them to want to do better. On the other hand, you have your Terence Fletchers, who is played here by J.K. Simmons, who are feared by their students and use this to get the results they're after. You could write whole essays on which teaching method is more effective, but right now the focus is on Fletcher, the monster who attempts to make Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) a greater drummer. This is the astounding and intense story at the heart of 'Whiplash'.You can tell within the opening minutes of the film that Neiman is not cool. He doesn't have many friends, and he lives for jazz and playing the drums. We open with him alone in a practice room, playing and trying to get better. This is when he has his first encounter with Fletcher, who is brash and cold. He makes no attempt to be friendly, he merely sees what he wants and leaves. Over the course of the film, Neiman is invited into Fletcher's high- profile jazz band, where he is the victim of verbal abuse, psychological torment, and ends up with an intense drive to impress. If anything, he wants to impress too much, and reacts badly to Fletcher taking away the things that he's given him. 90% of the film is one long psychological trick on Fletcher's part, slowly turning Neiman insane. What makes the film so inspiring is that for the last 10%, Neiman takes his sanity back.There are three elements at the heart of the film that make it so incredibly watchable and gripping. Firstly, the film is clean, classy and shot incredibly well. It has the colour scheme of a 'jazz' film, and some of the camera work, such as the flicking between drummer and conductor or instrument close-ups, is inspired. Next, the music is crisp and catchy, with so much toe-tapping throughout. The parts of the score that aren't played on screen are just as good, all fitting in with the styling of the film.But the most important element is made up of the two key performances at the centre of the movie - J.K. Simmons and Miles Teller are nothing but astounding in the film. In Teller's acting, you can see a real determination and desire to succeed. He brings across the awkwardness and lack of cool that the character has so well, and also his drum playing is pretty good. But it is Simmons who truly steals the show - Terence Fletcher is a terrifying, brutish, foul monster for the majority of the film, and simply would not be believable if he wasn't acted so well. The cursing and violence feels spontaneous, the coldness in his character seems to be so true, but I think it is the occasional signs of humanity (such as the discovery of a former pupil's death), which cement the character. He's not just a monster, he's another human who's been taken over by an internal drive. As much as Neiman's goal is to be one of the great drummers, Fletcher's goal is to cultivate one of the great musicians, something he believes he can only do through verbal abuse. His message is that 'Good job' is never going to make anyone great, and he argues it so well that you do leave the film believing that.It's possible to have read everything I've written so far and feel that 'Whiplash' is going to be a tough 2 hour pain-fest, but it's anything but. It's quite funny in parts, due to the absurdity of many of Fletcher's comments, and you can't help but leave it inspired. As for its place in this year's Oscar race, it utterly deserves its place among the other 'Best Film' nominees, and there is no doubt in my mind that it's one of the top contenders for that award.",10,1,4,17 February 2015
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Not just the best because Jar Jar doesn't say a single line...
","We've reached the last of the Star Wars reviews with the most recently released, and the best of the Prequels. This is not just because Jar Jar doesn't speak a single line. 'Revenge of the Sith' has the best storyline of the three, linking up well with the originals, and also has the best action and acting of all of them. Once again the visuals are phenomenal, with planets, cityscapes and fight scenes looking more impressive than ever.The plot is much more interesting in this episode, as we finally see the transition of Anakin into Vader, and it's great that Lucas shows us his exact reasoning. The fact that it's a good reason, that Anakin wants to save Padmé and is then convinced that the Jedi are evil, makes the film much better than it could have been if he'd suddenly gone rogue. The reveal that Palpatine is Darth Sidious is no real surprise, but it's a nice moment when that's finally out in the open. Also, the montage of droids killing the Jedi masters is quite emotional, as you realise the devastating effects that Mace Windu's defeat and Anakin's turn to the dark side has had. That, along with Anakin's murder of 'younglings', makes for some of the saddest moments in the whole hexalogy.The fight scenes are great in this episode too, and Anakin and Obi-Wan's final battle is gripping and exciting, with the lava of Mustafar playing the perfect backdrop to the fight. The final few scenes are really well done, in moving everybody around so that they're in the right place for the start of Episode IV. For example, Yoda's retreat into exile explains clearly why he's not in Episode IV. Lucas attempts valiantly to clean up the awful twist he created in Episode VI of Luke and Leia's relationship, and he explains well why they did not grow up together. I did dislike the erasure of C3PO's memory, but I suppose it was necessary to create a reason why he didn't remember anything in Episode IV.The place where the film falls down most, once again, is dialogue. It is always clear that the prequels have been scripted by Lucas himself, unlike the originals, because the dialogue is so much worse. This episode is host to so many awful lines ('If you're not with me, then you're my enemy' and 'Only a Sith deals in absolutes') that it does make the final battle, a very serious event, almost comical. It's hard to keep a straight face when Natalie Portman cries 'Anakin, you're breaking my heart', and it does ruin the grim nature a bit. However, apart from the dialogue, this is by far the strongest of the Prequels, and if JJ Abrams can write even a slightly better film than this, a Star Wars sequel trilogy would not be a bad thing at all.",7,1,2,2 July 2013
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Brilliantly self-aware, satirical and visually extremely unique...
","This was the last of the 8 'Best Picture' nominees from 2015 that I saw, and I was terrified of watching it. 'Birdman' had received a huge amount of hype over the lead up to the Oscars, and what if I only liked it because I thought I was supposed to? I went into the film ready to critique every tiny detail, to be annoyed by it and to go against the crowd. What made the film even more incredible, therefore, is how much I enjoyed it by the end. 'Birdman' completely took me into its world and made me adore it, not allowing me to find anything to be annoyed at. It's brilliantly self-aware, satirical and visually extremely unique, and what's more, it deserves every single nomination it's been given.In a plot that mirrors real life in no way whatsoever, Michael Keaton plays Riggan Thompson, an actor who cannot escape the shadow of the superhero he once played on film. Thompson has written, directed and is starring in a new play on Broadway in an attempt to revive a serious dramatic career, but not a lot is going right. He is forced to hire Mike Shiner, a self-absorbed actor with whom he is constantly at odds, and as a result every one of the previews goes in a very unexpected direction. Also at the heart of the film is his strained relationship with his daughter, played by Emma Stone, and with the two female members of his cast, played by Andrea Riseborough and Naomi Watts.The film builds up towards Opening Night, with everything making Thompson more and more stressed – he's convinced that the reviews are going to be terrible, that everything will go wrong. Making matters worse is the voice in the back of his head, that of his on screen alter-ego, Birdman. Birdman is frequently reminding him of how much of a failure he is, and it eventually drives Thompson to various breakdowns from which he does build himself back up. One scene involving Thompson flying about New York and becoming a superhero once again is visually stunning and a brilliant moment in his character development.It would be impossible to talk about the film without mentioning the visual effect at its core – the trick of making everything look like one continuous take. Iñárritu pulls it off masterfully, making it noticeable but not detracting from the on-screen action one bit. It merely complements the winding corridors of the theatre and makes everything seem almost dreamlike. The script is constantly sharp and very witty, never taking itself too seriously. This is crucial, especially given the huge amount of 'high art' that is referenced throughout the film. Everything from Jorge Luis Borges and Shakespeare to Mahler and Ravel is referenced throughout the film, and it takes huge risks at seeming unbelievably pretentious. Because you know that satire is at its heart, especially given the constant pop- culture references and deep conversations about the nature of art/celebrity, it's all very tongue-in-cheek and you're allowed to enjoy these artistic name-drops.Having only seen one Michael Keaton film before, that being the underwhelming Batman film that 'Birdman' is partially satirising, I didn't know what to expect, but I thought his performance here was outstanding. He brings across the mental struggle of his character perfectly, and also never stops being believable – the scene where he rushes through Times Square in his tighty-whiteys is hilarious, and Keaton suspends your disbelief the perfect amount so that it never stops feeling true. The supporting performances work very well, and Norton, Stone and Zach Galifianakis are all very good throughout. There is far too much good stuff to mention here, but visual effects, set dressing (nothing feels glamorous and that adds to the realism) and music all deserve a look in.So, 'Birdman'. I made myself want to hate it just in case, and it made me love it. I adored the artistry of it all, was entirely captivated by its world and found every element fascinating. Perhaps the messages about art, criticism, celebrity and social media struck me most, but I think it could appeal to anyone. Definitely a very strong contender in this year's Oscar race.",10,2,10,17 February 2015
Mary and Max," This is a dark, morbid and hilarious comedy all at the same time...
","People are often too quick to judge movies before they even know a lot about them. I suffer from this, and the number of times I've said something like 'Channing Tatum, I'm not watching that' is extremely high. My own parents underwent a similar thing when I tried to convince them to watch 'Mary and Max' for what was my second viewing of it. And to be honest, it's a hard sell: Australian indie claymation film? No thanks. The main thing to remember here is that your instincts are often wrong, and the phrase 'never judge a book by its cover' applies here too. 'Mary and Max' is a dark, morbid and hilarious comedy about an odd friendship and mental illness, and took me completely by surprise.The movie tells the story of Mary Dinkle, a young girl growing up in Australia with her alcoholic mother, who chooses a random name from the phone book and decides to write to them. She lives a relatively poor life, has few friends and is very naive about certain aspects of life. The recipient of her letter is Max Horowitz, an obese Jewish man living in New York, with various mental disorders and few friends. Their unlikely relationship is so heartwarming, as they manage to change, and eventually save, each others lives. Be warned it can feel quite depressing at times, and at around the 2/3rds mark you're sure that it can't get any worse for either of them, but it's worth sticking with, as the ending is both uplifting and beautiful.The two main voice roles are performed by Toni Collette (who eventually makes an appearance towards the film's end) and Philip Seymour Hoffman, and the dialogue in the letters they send is constantly witty and endearing. They learn about each others problems and often offer solutions, with varying degrees of success. The other big voice role is that of the narrator, played by Barry Humphries (known to many as Dame Edna Everage). His part is a perfect example of how great the writing in this film is, providing crucial observations and character information. The film is made even better with the well crafted animation, making it feel like a grown up version of Wallace and Gromit. Visual touches, such as the black-and-white setting of New York, and sepia Melbourne landscapes, help to make the film even more clever and beautiful.'Mary and Max' is a beautiful movie, whose only flaw is the occasional bit of dragging, which is understandable given the tricky medium that the filmmakers are working with. It's enjoyable and funny, and a continuing example of how much I respect the IMDb Top 250, on which this features. This is not one of the best 250 films ever made, but if it's appearance on the list makes sure that more people see this film, then it deserves to be there. It deals with a tricky subject matter but does so in a very watchable way.",9,1,3,1 June 2014
Monsters University," While slightly unnecessary, it is by no means awful...
","It would not take me long to write a sizeable list of awful, unnecessary sequels to really good movies. If you'd asked me 2 years ago, I'd have assumed that 'Monsters University' would be on that list eventually. I can today declare that while it may be slightly unnecessary, it is by no means awful. It's a hilarious film, which is very nostalgic for those of us who have grown up with the original.The plot itself is slightly thin and unremarkable, with Mike and Sulley hating each other at university because Mike works hard but is a loser, and Sulley is popular and lazy. They eventually are put in a situation which makes them have to work together and eventually become great friends. It's simple, but also not extremely important. The film is more focused on the relationships between all of the characters, and creating great scenarios where the humour and characters really shine. The different trials of 'Scare Games' provide a lot of laughs, as do the strange quirks of Oozma Kappa (Squishy Squibbles' mother is always funny). The horror film parody which we see towards the end is both hilarious, extremely clever, and a great moment in the Mike/Sulley relationship.The thing that makes the film so special is that it reminds us of the original while also not letting this get in the way of new things. Many of the original cast reprise their roles, but there are also great newcomers, like Helen Mirren and most of the Oozma Kappa team. We discover the reasons for many things in the original, like why Randall hates Mike and Sulley so much. There are drop in appearances from some of the best characters in the first film, like Roz or the Abominable Snowman. The best reference by far is this poster above Randall's bed – as always with Pixar, its the subtleties that really make the films special. The animation itself looks as good as ever, and really shows how far Pixar have come since the original in terms of technology. Some of the crowd scenes are stunning, due to the range of colours and number of unique monsters.There is no doubt that I would 'Monsters University' to somebody of any age. It's full of warmth and fun, like most of Pixar's fantastic back catalogue. It also puts them at 3-1 in terms of sequels, giving me high hope for 'Finding Dory' in a couple of years.",9,0,0,25 October 2013
Before Sunrise," Two complete strangers strike up a conversation on a train...
","Two complete strangers strike up a conversation on a train. The country is foreign to both of them, but they're from different cultures. She's French, he's American, they talk. And they continue to talk for the rest of the evening, having hopped off the train together, roaming around the city of Vienna. This is the premise of 'Before Sunrise', the first part of Richard Linklater's 'Before' series. It's a movie about everything and nothing – there's no action, no events, but there's drama and comedy in the constant conversation that we are presented with. By the end of the 100 minute film, we feel like we know the two of them inside out. As basic premises go, this has the potential to be a long and very boring ordeal. But the conversation is witty and intellectual, and never feels boring because you feel like a third party sharing it with them.As they walk around Vienna, they meet various different characters. They ask some locals for things to do, meet a man who offers to write them a poem, are confronted with a palm reader at dinner. Each encounter tells us more about the two personalities that we're watching. Both are incredibly romantic, but Jesse has a cynical edge to his character (shown by his reaction to the palm reader). The love that the pair share for each other is clear from very early on, and since they know that this may be the only time they meet, everything moves quickly. They share deep secrets with each other (at one point by the means of hilarious fake phone calls to friends), and share a first kiss at the top of Vienna's ferris wheel. When the next day comes, they part ways, agreeing to meet again in 6 months in the same place. They don't share contact details, knowing that it will happen if it should. This leaves the viewer with one of the most beautiful and infuriating endings in film (but not, strangely, in this series) – will they ever see each other again.The film would be nothing without the superb performances from Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, whose characters are both fascinating and likable. The script, partly written by them, is extremely sharp and funny, and Linklater's no direction is ever present. This is the birth of a style, very focused on conversation and long shots, which carries over to much of his later work. In all, 'Before Sunrise' is never boring, and leaves you wanting even more. Which is lucky, because there are two sequels, both of which are equally fantastic.",9,0,0,31 October 2013
Saving Mr. Banks," From the outside, it wasn't going to be much. How very wrong we all were...
","Let's look back briefly at movies about movies being made. 'Hitchcock' is the main example of this type of film, and was a likable but shallow drama. 2012′s 'Hugo' (just fitting into the category) was much better, focussing on other people who happen to be related to film. So now to 'Saving Mr. Banks', which follows Walt Disney's (Tom Hanks) quest to adapt the much beloved children's novel 'Mary Poppins' into a film. From the outside, and from the far-too-detailed trailer, it wasn't going to be much, just a lighthearted film with some emotional backstories which we all knew the ending of. How very very wrong we all were.Emma Thompson plays P.L. Travers, the writer of 'Mary Poppins', a serious woman who has been brought to L.A. by Walt Disney to adapt her creation into a film. Thompson is hilarious in the role, beating down many ideas put forwards and being generally nasty to everyone. The development of the film is an interesting half of the film, and we see where many ideas came from – the characters, the designs, and especially the songs. Taking the roles of the Sherman Brothers are Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak, who provide even more great comedy performances to the film – the scene where they all sing 'Let's Go Fly a Kite' is particularly brilliant. Hanks is, of course, a fantastic addition as the man-child Walt Disney, and we see both his fun and slightly darker sides throughout the course of the film.This is only half of the film, however, and the lighter half at that. The other is made up of Travers' flashbacks to her childhood, as she remembers the people who inspired her characters. Colin Farrell plays her father, who tries to keep her imagination flowing even when times are getting hard for the family, and who descends further into alcoholism every day. It's a tragic story, and helps you to understand the reasons why Travers' is so pernickety about the characters – she knows each one of them so well. This is something that Disney picks up on, and the best moments of the film is shared between these two main characters, leading up to a fantastic ending.The film's other greatest part is its portrayal of L.A. in the 1960s as a warm, perfect place, and the retro landscapes help so much to draw the audience in. Hancock builds fantastic visual contrasts between 60s California and Australian desert in 1906, and we can adapt to the shift in tone well each time we enter one of the flashbacks. The film's strong script is also a huge merit, and many scenes land big laughs. But it is the performances which make it so great and enjoyable, and why we connect so well with the film. Many may ask whether Travers was really that horrible, or if it's just over egged for the film. Well, that's answered during the credits, with actual recordings of the script sessions, and it's then when you realise just how accurate Thompson's acting is. It's a fantastic and endearing film, perfect for any fan of the original book or film.",9,0,1,22 April 2014
Rear Window," A fine example of Hitchcock's extreme cleverness and subtlety...
","Alfred Hitchcock was a master director, and Rear Window is a fine example of his extreme cleverness and subtlety. It's strange reviewing this film first after all of the Star Wars films, because they're complete polar opposites. Rear Window is a prime example of Hitchcock's genius, since, apart from one or two shots, the entire film is shot from James Stewart's apartment. This means that all action in the film, whether of Stewart and Kelly inside or the inhabitants of other apartments, is seen from the point of view of Stewart's character. This completely changes the way that we might view the film, since you're seeing it in the same way as Stewart – as a voyeur, peeking into the private lives of the other people on the block. It's extremely effective, and adds to the suspense of the film greatly.The story itself is both interesting and clever, with the main character trying to convince others that he has witnessed a murder, and attempting to find proof in what he sees whilst spying on his neighbours. Hitchcock introduces a large number of characters who we never properly meet, yet we feel that we know them very well. For example, 'Miss Lonelyheart' is a character who at one point is about to commit suicide, and Hitchcock provides us with a good background to her story, as well as a fitting conclusion to it. The clearest evidence as to how much we have been spying on these people is their changes at the end of the film. We can clearly see how each group, whether it is the married couple, the songwriter or the dancer, has continued living and changed in the process.The murder case itself is very cleverly laid out, as is Stewart's logic throughout. Hitchcock knows exactly where to point the camera, constantly hinting to things which are later figured out. I was very proud that I figured out what the dog was doing far before any of the characters, since Hitchcock seemed to show him to us too frequently for his actions to be ordinary. The final battle is a bit over the top, but I thought Stewart's use of flash bulbs was a clever defence technique. However the build up to Mr. Thorwald entering his apartment is very tense and a tiny bit scary.On the whole this is an intelligent crime thriller, with a great insight into humanity's 'spying and gossip' nature.",9,0,1,3 July 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," I haven't been so glad I was wrong in predicting a movie in a long time...
","The biggest question when making a sequel to a 'high-concept' film is 'where can this go next?'. The whole film is made with an idea or event in the forefront, not necessarily the characters. Therefore the sequel can go one of two ways: focus more on the characters this time, or have a related but bigger event ('Jaws 2' - more sharks!). Where 'Catching Fire' succeeds most is finding a good balance between these two. The character relationships are expanded on well, and we get the title event without it being a rehash of the first film. I have to confess now that I never expected to like the first one, since young adult novel adaptations seem to be so difficult to make work without cliché or melodrama. I haven't been so glad I was wrong in a long time.The world of 'The Hunger Games' has changed drastically since the first film, and Katniss Everdeen is both a symbol of hope for the oppressed people, and a part of their downfall, as it only makes the state fight back stronger. She and Peeta have to continue the charade of a relationship in order to maintain this hope, and it is here that the two lead actors, Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson, show their greatest strengths. There is great chemistry between them, and you can easily feel this anger and pain. Helping them along the way is Woody Harrelson as Haymitch, who continues to make an interesting and often amusing alcoholic.The intricate style of the first film is retained and built upon here, and the film excellently portrays visual contrasts between District 12 and the Capital - it's very much a matter of 'how the other half live'. And the film wouldn't really be the same without the title event, the actual 'Hunger Games', which manage to be even more impressive than those in the first film. At the charge of this, having replaced Seneca from the first film, is Plutarch Heavensbee, played masterfully by the late Philip Seymour Hoffmann. The concept behind the games this time is so smart, and it's constantly thrilling.The film's greatest successes come in two things: you never feel the two hour runtime, because it's really a movie of two parts and links the two seamlessly; and it's arguably a better movie than the first one, something which is so difficult to pull off. 'The Hunger Games' laid all the groundwork, characters and drama. 'Catching Fire' expands on this, making it relatable but still a movie with a different feeling. The cliffhanger is infuriating, but it just means that I can't wait for the final two parts. The biggest question now is where the films go next. I haven't read the last book, so I'm not sure whether we get another Hunger Games, or with the impending revolution, the tone will be very different. I suppose time will answer that.",9,1,15,28 May 2014
Looper," One of the most watchable and enjoyable blockbusters I've seen recently...
","The second time travel related movie in two days (see 'Primer'), and I have to be honest, I preferred this one a fair bit more. Yes, it's a lot longer and has a bigger budget, but these weren't the things that made me prefer it. They contributed, but honestly I thought the story was better and that it managed a similar amount of cleverness with much less confusion. It's really well crafted, and one of the most watchable and enjoyable blockbusters I've seen recently.'Looper' tells the story of Joe, who works as a hit-man in the year 2044, killing off people who are sent back from 2074 in order to remove them cleanly from the future. The first 40 minutes of the film are mostly exposition, and we don't get to the main event (the arrival of Bruce Willis) for a while, but it's still really interesting as we learn how our world is different to theirs. We see lots of poverty, new drugs, the arrival of telekinesis, and it's clear that the film is trying to be both close a reality in some parts, and distant in others. There are no flying cars or anything as extreme as that. The arrival of Bruce Willis is done with an incredibly clever segment, where we see the process through which he first lives those 30 years between Young Joe and Old Joe. It's essentially a display of everything that separates the two characters, as it has happened for one, but is still to come for the other.Questions are raised that we don't usually get in a time travel film. Does Old Joe know exactly what Young Joe is about to do, because things could change instantly? I really enjoyed the sending of messages from young versions to old through the skin, and thought it worked well as a grizzly method of communication. The rest of the film is very watchable, if slightly slower than the action packed first hour. If I have one problem with the film, it's that it's too long when Joe is staying with Sara, and their eventual night of romance feels very gratuitous.The climax of the film is very exciting, and lots of great action scenes happen along the way. Bruce Willis does prove that he can still do what he used to do best, and delivers his best performance in years. It's really fun, very smart, and the decision that Joe makes in the final minutes makes for a very satisfying ending.",9,3,7,27 August 2013
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," I wonder what there is to say about Star Wars that hasn't already been said!
","I wonder what there is to say about Star Wars that hasn't already been said by some fanboy or other. I won't endeavour to say anything profound, just give my own personal opinions. It's a really great film. As soon as the opening text is over, you're straight into the action. Things look strange, because everything in this film tries to be new, but somewhat familiar, because it borrows a few ideas from previous films. I wonder what the sets would look like without a bit of '2001' influence. For a film made 30 years ago, it looks stunning. The two suns image is particularly striking, and there are a lot of other remarkable sets, like the inside of the Millennium Falcon or Cantina. Sure, the explosions look a bit over the top and fake, but hey, it's 1977!The acting is very good, held up by a strong lead performance by Mark Hamill, among others. It doesn't really drag too much at all, and makes you ask lots of questions, usually providing the answers fairly quickly. Harrison Ford is a bit annoying and overly grumpy in this episode and occasionally got on my nerves when arguing with Leia. But it's all saved because James Earl Jones has the perfect voice for Darth Vader, and nobody questions that. I quite like the fact that, despite Vader being the one that everyone remembers, he's not in charge. The captain of the Death Star and Emperor Palpatine are actually the leaders, so you assume that they must be even worse than Vader, who seems to be the most evil person ever.The ending annoyed me slightly. Not because it's far too convenient that there is a very obvious weak spot to the Death Star which the rebel forces can easily take advantage of, but because the final scene goes on for a bit too long. The chase, despite cool graphics, doesn't really change throughout its run, and isn't particularly thrilling. Thankfully, scenes like the 'walls closing in' part are quite fun and keep you on your toes. Even though you can predict some scenes by the Family Guy rule 'We'll be okay, there are too many main characters here', they're still very exciting. One of the film's greatest strengths is that you are constantly rooting for the main characters, and they are easily relatable.",9,0,1,20 June 2013
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," I would argue that this is the best of all six Star Wars films...
","I would argue, as would many others, that this is the best of all six Star Wars films. I mean, it's just got so many awesome components to it. Firstly, there's the change in Leia and Han's relationship. Their previous banter throughout Episode IV, and the first half of this film, almost begs for the two of them to end up together. And I'm really glad that they did at the moment when they did, because to be honest, their constant jibes at each other were getting a bit annoying. Thanks to that carbon-freezing chamber, they stop bickering and eventually end up together. Next, there's Yoda. I'm pretty sure Star Wars would not be nearly as successful as it is without this little green creature. He's completely insane at first (a stark contrast with the prequel trilogy), and it really works in this light. He's the crazy master that Luke has to follow because Obi-Wan trusts him, and despite all of the crazy, he's very lovable and quite awesome.There are so many other things in this film that I could mention, because there is so much of merit here. I could talk in great detail about Hoth, AT-ATs, Cloud City, Obi-Wan visions and of course Lando Calrissian. However, there is one major plot point which I want to talk about, which is the famous 'I am your father' twist. (I would say SPOILER, but please!) I have previously commented on the extensive use of twists in the plot of Star Wars, and the fact that you can't be sure what was decided on originally, and what was a late addition. I do believe, however, that this twist was thought up in the original story, when Episode IV was being written. Having watched 'A New Hope' knowing about it, there are a lot of things said which hint at the fact that Vader is Luke's real father. It is also completely spoiled if you've seen any of the prequels Despite the fact that it's now become a complete cliché, it still works well in the film, and later becomes a useful plot point in the climax of Episode VI.",10,0,0,21 June 2013
Inside Llewyn Davis," This is a continuation of the dark sense of humour that the Coen Brothers have thrived on...
","I have to confess that I don't know as much of the work of the Coen Brothers as I'd like to. I've seen 'No Country for Old Men', 'True Grit' and 'O Brother, Where Are Thou', all of which I adored, and 'The Ladykillers', which really isn't as bad as people said it was. Their dark sense of humour and ability to capture beautiful scenes is what sets them apart from the crowd as directors. Naturally, 'Inside Llewyn Davis' is no different, with brilliant black comedy and memorable cinematography, except this time, just like 'O Brother', we have the pleasure of music as well.The title character, played by Oscar Isaac, is a folk singer living in Greenwich Village in 1961, around the same time as Bob Dylan. Nothing goes right in his life, with his singing partner's recent suicide and his failing solo album both adding to his depression. He is homeless as well, but despite so many bad things he doesn't give up, and constantly continues to try and make it. This is not always helped by the people around him, including his friend Jean (Carey Mulligan) who tells him that she's pregnant and it might be his, and the always odious Roland Turner (John Goodman). The Coens write their characters extremely well, and they all have believable relationships with each other. They can give us a first impression with so few words too, which makes the characters even stronger. Their writing is as strong as always, with their eye for dark comedy coming through constantly. There are so many devastating scenes which you can't help but laugh at, or throw away lines that make you chuckle despite their grave nature. Goodman's line, 'George Washington Bridge? You throw yourself off the Brooklyn Bridge, traditionally. George Washington Bridge? Who does that?' is mere genius.Three things, apart from the plot, make this film such a joy to watch. Firstly, the acting is brilliant. Isaac's performance is bold and intimate, making us long for him to succeed so much. Among the supporting characters, Goodman, Mulligan, surprisingly Justin Timberlake and F. Murray Abraham all leave their mark with brilliant, funny or devastating scenes. And the cat that Llewyn is charged with looking after for so long is also great. The cinematography is great too, with the film being shot with a bleak, saturated lens. It feels dark and appropriate for the setting, but doesn't become too noticeable so as to be annoying. And finally the music is brilliant. All of the songs are memorable and well sung, with 'The Death of Queen Jane' being my particular favourite, mainly because Isaac sings it so well. They don't feel pointless in the film, but there are times where you can just sit back and enjoy them.'Inside Llewyn Davis' won't please everyone, because there are people who simply just don't 'get' the Coen Brothers' sense of humour. But for those that do, it's incredibly rewarding, and undoubtedly one of their best works yet. It was utterly robbed of a Best Picture nomination in February, and I cannot understand for the life of me why.",9,1,2,12 July 2014
Moon," Fascinating and thrilling, if occasionally slow-moving...
","I can only think of two movies which feature one main character for the majority of the film â€“ 'Moon' and 'Gravity'. The surface parallels between them are surprisingly numerous. Both place their solitary character in space, with only the voice of a computer/mission control helping them for the most part, and both are ultimately trying to get back to Earth. From here on, however, the two films are very different. Rather than continue to compare them, I will merely focus on what 'Moon', the directorial debut for Duncan Jones, does well.It would be impossible to talk about the film without spending a large amount of time on Sam Rockwell. Rockwell shows a great amount of depth in his portrayal of Sam Bell, the only man working on a moon base, and it is this performance which keeps the movie interesting throughout its relatively short running time. It's a film with endless twists and turns, constantly keeping you guessing what's going to happen next, and often, what's happening now. This strength is also occasionally the movie's greatest flaw, as there are many moments where confusion rather than interest are produced in the audience.The film successfully continues and builds on many classic sci-fi tropes, especially with some of the space-ship visuals and the voice of Kevin Spacey as GERTY harking back to 2001 and HAL. Spacey's voice has the perfect quality for a menacing computer, and by using more than just computerised monotone, he constantly has you guessing whether he is friend or foe to Bell. The minimalistic space ship design makes for a great backdrop, as does the exterior lunar landscape, which looks surprisingly good despite the film's low budget. Clint Mansell's score for the film is another great strength, using a combination of minimalism and electronic sounds to echo the film's mystery and its setting.Ultimately, the film is fascinating and thrilling, if occasionally slow-moving, and a welcome addition to the low-budget sci-fi canon. It shows great talent from Duncan Jones and, having seen the superior 'Source Code', it suggests that even better things are yet to come from him.",8,0,3,31 December 2013
The Breakfast Club," Five teenagers are forced to stay in a room together and we learn so much about them....
","Placing a small group of characters in a single setting for the entire running time of a movie is clever narrative technique – it forces them to talk to each other, and through this, we learn more about those people through their speech, mannerisms and interactions with each other. The concept of 'The Breakfast Club' is exactly that. Five teenagers from all walks of society are forced to stay in a room together, and through this they bond and we learn so much about them. And it's also funny, nostalgic and a movie that only John Hughes could have pulled off well.The five characters are high school stereotypes, and I think there's one of them that each of us relate to. There's the jock, the rebel, the psycho, the prom-queen and the geek, and they all think they're so different from each other. At first, they argue and fight during their detention. Eventually, though, they realise that they're not so different, and actually have a shared hatred – the authority which is keeping them in detention. We see them rebel together, get high and reveal their darkest secrets. It manages to be charming and funny while never reaching cliché. Where Hughes is a master is character development, and he shows us how the characters are bonding and developing without being too preachy.The script and direction is very well managed, with John Hughes tapping into the teenage mentality perfectly. What's odd is how timeless the film is, with little having changed in school character-types over almost 30 years. The acting is also great, with Judd Nelson and Anthony Michael Hall giving especially strong performances. The film's focus on teenagers also gives a message about the problems of adults, and the one major adult character in the film, played by Paul Gleason, is also one of my favourites. He is written really well as the antagonistic vice- principal, and Hughes succeeds well in allowing the teens to usurp him, but not too easily.The one main flaw that the film has is in its single setting. It works for the majority, but there are definitely times where it lags and feels trapped by the confines that it has set itself. There is not much action in some parts, and the dialogue doesn't always carry it through. That said, it's funny and enjoyable, and an important piece of film for any adolescent to see. There's something for all of us to learn in the adventures of 'The Breakfast Club'.",8,10,16,26 January 2014
The Bourne Supremacy," Matt Damon continues to be a great action hero...
","One of the greatest challenges to overcome when producing a franchise is that, inevitably, people will change. Actors sometimes move on, and this can greatly change the vision and style of the franchise. Results can differ greatly: 'Terminator: Salvation' proved that the franchise was nothing without Arnie, but 'The Dark Knight' managed just as well with Maggie Gyllenhall as 'Batman Begins' had with Katie Holmes. But what about directors? Alfonso Cuaron's taking over of the Harry Potter franchise, albeit briefly, took the series to an even better place after Chris Columbus' first two films. So how would 'The Bourne Supremacy' cope without Doug Liman at the helm, and with Paul Greengrass instead? In short – very well indeed. Greengrass is now known, after 'United 93″ and 'Captain Phillips', for his intimate, documentary-like style, which makes for great thrillers. And thankfully it carries off in this too, showcasing Matt Damon's abilities perfectly in numerous sequences.Matt Damon continues to be a great action hero and the matter of 'learning stuff while he does' is one of the things that continues to make this series so watchable. The film follows Jason Bourne's continual quest to find out who he is, while getting caught up in CIA operations and being framed for crimes he didn't commit. He's constantly on the run from CIA Deputy Director Pamela Landy, played superbly by Joan Allen, and their two phone conversations late in the film show a great dynamic between the two characters.This film plays more with the nature of Bourne's memory loss, and is very interesting visually when his memories start to come back to him. 'Supremacy''s use of plot is extremely bold, especially in killing off an important main character extremely early on, but carries it off effectively. This device makes the rest of the movie more thrilling, because you now know that no character is truly safe, apart maybe from Bourne himself. The film's greatest strength, however, is its gripping action sequences, and this film has plenty of car chases and fight scenes to keep the audience happy. At times, the actual plot can be a bit muddled or confusing, but action is never too far around the corner, and is always worth waiting for.So here it is, 'The Bourne Supremacy' is a rare movie. It's a sequel that's better than its original, but despite the differences in aesthetic, it doesn't feel that far removed from 'Identity', just a development on those ideas. The franchise's weakness continues to be its slightly muddled plot, but perhaps it only feels that way because we're so used to Hollywood spoon-feeding. It's a film that's definitely worth putting effort into, because the payoff is superb.",9,2,2,28 May 2014
Princess Mononoke," The tale of Man vs. Nature
","There is a long-running debate about Studio Ghibli movies as to whether it is necessary to watch them with subtitles, or it is okay to use the dubbed English. I won't get too far into this for fear of starting an argument, but for 'Princess Mononoke', I did feel that the subtitles slightly ruined my viewing experience. Unlike many other movies that I've watched with subs, they felt slightly distracting. However, despite this, I did enjoy the film very much.The movie is essentially the tale of man vs. nature. A prince from a secluded tribe has to leave to meet his fate and save himself from certain death. Along the way, he meets a princess who is the daughter of a god (a large wolf), and she is fighting another woman who is the head of a large mining cooperation. The iron mine's presence means that the forest, home to many spirits, demons and other creatures, is being destroyed. To the untrained viewer, 'Princess Mononoke' is just a dressed up fairy tale, about the destruction of the countryside and pollution. Really, it's a lot more than that. There's a lot about good and evil in the film, and how one person's good is another person's evil. It's very thought provoking, and creates a lot of questions afterwards. The characters are strange and fascinating, and their stories are told in such a way that you feel like you know what they've been through. Ashitaka's constant ability to see good in everyone is a quality which is not often seen, and it works well throughout.The biggest and best part of the film, however, is the animation. It's very beautiful and the fact that it's hand drawn makes it even more stunning. The action is gripping, and the huge battles towards the end are always interesting and engaging. Miyazaki has a magical way of thinking up spectacular monsters and creatures which you let yourself believe exist while your watching. It's very quirky in its animation, with strange things like the kodama, but this merely adds to its charm.The biggest problem with the film is its length. It's over 2 hours long, and this just feels like too much at numerous parts of the film. Even Spirited Away, which is barely 2 hours, feels like a strain at some point, and in Mononoke, it really drags at times when you're not really sure what's going on. The length does make the ending feel like more of an achievement, though, and it's the ending that makes certain parts of the film feel more worth it.",8,0,1,11 July 2013
The Godfather," A film of epic proportions...
","I must confess, I find it really tricky to watch movies that are considered 'The Greatest of All Time', because of one enormous fear: What if I don't like it? Sure, you don't have to stick to social majorities when forming your opinion on a film, but I suppose there's a certain reaction that comes when you say something like: 'Yeah, I wasn't so seen on The Shawshank Redemption, actually'. So this was my worry when I finally purchased 'The Godfather' trilogy on DVD, and sat down to watch the first one. Thankfully, I absolutely adored it. It's a film of epic proportions, following 10 years in the history of the Corleone Family, with excellent drama and beautiful cinematography. And it also keeps you interested for the entirety of its 3 hour run time, which is by no means an easy feat.'The Godfather' follows Don Vito Corleone (played by the masterful Marlon Brando), the head of one of the most powerful mafia families, and his son Michael (Al Pacino), who is soon to take over the family. We begin with Michael's wedding, which uses brilliant juxtapositions between the bright, happy event, and the dark office of the patriarch, where he hears the requests of his family and friends. It's a great scene because we realise the image that the family tries to send out, and the actual goings on behind the scenes. We also observe the power and influence that the family has in places like the media (involving the head of a certain animal), so that we can then understand how much of a force to be reckoned with they are.The film takes place over 10 years, and packs a lot of events into 3 hours, from the attempted assassination of Vito, to Michael's refuge in Sicily. Coppola shows us so clearly how life in a mafia family is a dangerous one, where you always have to watch your back and where people are always trying to kill you. Thanks to the character of Kay (played by a young Diane Keaton), we get an outsider's perspective on the family too, and Michael tries to show her that the business will become 'legitimate' soon, although we knows this is unlikely. The greatest sequence in the film is also one of the most famous – the massacre that takes place during a christening, with sinister Bach organ music played over the top. It's a fantastic section because Coppola is contrasting life and death so well, making us aware of the cycle of mafia life.'The Godfather' is truly one of the great masterpieces of cinema. It's complex and often slow going, but always reaches points which make waiting worthwhile. The acting is totally stunning, which Pacino and Brando shining in particular in their roles, and the whole film is shot with a dark, noir-ish lens. Every part of it is well thought out, particularly its score and pacing, and you can appreciate it at the end as both a great feat of filmmaking, and a satisfying watch. I was extremely pleased to find how much I enjoyed watching this incredible film, and can't wait to tuck into the rest of the trilogy.",10,1,2,20 July 2014
