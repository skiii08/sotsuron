Hereditary," The only thing good about this film was Toni Collets acting skills.
","Ok I rated this film based strictly on Toni's acting. She gave an outstanding performance. I could not wait to see this film, a film that was a major disappointment. There were entirely to many scene that did not explain what the heck was going on -or left you wondering what the heck just happen. It really was a waste of time unless you like to laugh.",6,0,1,7 September 2018
