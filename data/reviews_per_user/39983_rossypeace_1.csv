The Sound of Music," Movie filled with variety.
","I do love and value this movie not because wsome body rocommended it to me but because i found it timelesswork of art act.The most important thing i enjoy from the movie are the songs.I love the creativity in all the songs.Maria actually creates most of the songs on the spot.I do love the way the characters are presented and the fact that all the fact that the movie is made in such a way that every body can watch and enjoy it.This is from kids to adults.The title of this movie actually suits what it is talking about.I enjoy the way all the actors play their roles beginning from the little girl to the captain.All of them have entered history just because of the job well done.The use cause and effect in the movie makes it more interesting.For example,Maria immediately leaves captain's house when she starts seeing hatred in the eyes of the baroness.The use of humour in the movie makes it more interesting to all viewers.For example the way the baroness is been interrupted whenever she tries to sing.The way the cast is been presented,their beautiful voices are what one cannot resist watching the movie over and over.The choice of the landscape like the hills and the mountains gives a very beautiful view.I think the way love is being shown in this movie is very real.The characters slowly fall in love.This movie is really filled with variety.It is a wonderfully structured and acted movie.I think no other movie compares this one.",Null,0,6,3 April 2007
