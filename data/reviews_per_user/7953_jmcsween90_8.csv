Catch Me If You Can," Great director doing what he does best
","Although his ventures into sci-fi in recent years turned up interesting results, Steven Spielberg has in this movie returned to more conventional story telling and the end product is a mouth watering feast of cinematic thrills. The film is based on the true life story of Frank Abignale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), a teenage con artist and fraudster who becomes the youngest ever person to wind up on the FBIs most wanted list. Having seen his parents seemingly perfect marriage crumble following his father's troubles with the IRS, DiCaprio enters a self destructive fantasy world when he turns his attention to forging cheques and impersonating airline pilots. Soon the Feds become aware of his illegal activities and Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) picks up the scent.In an effortless two hours and twenty minutes, Spielberg uses his considerable talents to weave an atmospheric and exciting tale of cat and mouse as DiCaprio always remains just one step ahead of the determined FBI agent pursuing him. Slowly the noose tightens around DiCaprio's neck, but not before he has a chance to defraud millions of dollars and successfully trick his way into a variety of jobs he was unqualified to do. As his increasingly sophisticated exploits land him in greater trouble, he finds himself further and further removed from reality and he is left with no one to trust and no where to go but to keep on running. With meaningful relationships destined to end in tears, he develops a deep rapport with the only person who has any understanding of him  his pursuer Tom Hanks.
Catch Me if you Can' confirms yet again that Spielberg has no peer when it comes to making purposeful popcorn entertainment. He can thrill and audience without ever sacrificing the twin pillars of strong scripting and good acting. DiCaprio excels as the charming con man, while Hanks' measured performance as the dogged FBI agent is an effortless turn that once again reconfirms his status as one of Hollywood's most capable leading men. In the midst of the battle of the big names, special mention must go to the great Christopher Walken as DiCaprio's father who steals every scene from the big boys. An exuberant jazz score from John Williams and a sumptuous production design that captures all the design flair of the period adds icing to this most enticing of cinematic cakes.",8,1,2,8 March 2003
Fight Club," Packs a Smart Punch
","It is rare that a film of this nature could be so profoundly philosophical while at the same providing some first class entertainment. Ed Norton has never been better as the anonymous corporate lap dog who goes through a major identity crisis when he meets the enigmatic Brad Pitt. Sort of an 'American Beauty' for twenty and thirty-somethings, 'Fight Club' manages to deal with the real complexities of being a man in a corporate driven, consumer saturated mess of a society on the cusp of a new millennium. Although Fincher's masterful direction tends to go awry in the third act (which regrettably lessens this films impact), 'Fight Club' is nonetheless one of the more impressive and intelligent pieces of mainstream entertainment of the last few years.",10,0,1,1 May 2000
Ed Wood," 'A' masterpiece of 'B' genius
","In the hands of Tim Burton the story of Edward D. Wood Jr  widely hailed as the worst filmmaker of all time  becomes a magnificently bizarre comic-tragic tale of a unique artist' and his struggle to make incredibly bad movies. Set during the Halcyon days of B' movies in the 1950's, Ed Wood' examines in great sympathetic detail the life, loves, film directing and cross-dressing habits of a man who has symbolised everything that is bad about motion pictures. Wood was a native of small town America who came to Hollywood to achieve fame and stardom just like so many others, and in the process he achieved just that but for all the wrong reasons. Artistically inept in every way, each of his theatrical and cinematic features was always greeted with groans of horror and disbelief on the part of critics and producers alike. Yet with this film the tragedy of Wood's abysmal work was introduced to another generation of moviegoers who were prepared to fondly recognise the eponymous hero as the King of bad movies  a title he truly deserves.Depp in the role of Wood provides another characteristically quirky performance, brimming with exuberance, passion and a little self deprecating irony. Burton's film  beautifully shot in black and white  paints a loving portrait of the artist as a young battler, determined to realise his vision in its entirety and yet completely oblivious to the fact that he just had no ability whatsoever. A film that could so easily have been a cruel parody about a talentless no-hoper has under the masterful and subtle direction of Hollywood's later day Ed Wood become a wistful homage to a man with a vision that no one wanted to see.Central to this movie is Wood's friendship with the ailing washed up Bela Lugosi  a major motion picture star who achieved international fame as the lead in the 1931 version of Dracula' and then gradually plummeted into obscurity and drug addiction. Lugosi stared in many of Wood's most famous films including Night of the Ghoul', the unforgettable Glen or Glenda' and the one widely regarded as the worst ever committed to celluloid, Plan 9 from Outer Space'. Martin Landau both looks and sounds like the downtrodden movie star who is desperately trying to recapture glimpses of his former glory, and deservedly won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for the role. Ed Wood's reverential treatment and acceptance of the man everyone else forgot is the touching heartbeat of the film that sketches its characters as so inherently likeable despite being outcasts of society.With its inspired casting and evenly paced direction that blends a mixture of horror, comedy and tragedy, Ed Wood' is perhaps the finest film in Burton's distinguished yet highly unusual career. In some respects it works well as a later day Sunset Boulevard', a damning indictment of Hollywood's shunning of the little guy and burying the stars that have lost their appeal, yet on the other hand it is reverential biopic of a man who followed his dreams and visions as diligently as his mentor Orson Welles  although without the same degree of success. The principle strength of the film lies in the outstanding performances of Depp and Landau, with a supporting cast including Sarah Jessica Parker as his demented girlfriend, Patricia Arquette as his one true love, and Bill Murray as camp would be transsexual providing excellent support.Wood may well have been the worst film maker of all time, yet as Tim Burton himself said `It takes talent to make a really good movie, but it also takes talent to make a really bad movie.' Wood never compromised what little artistic integrity he had, and in the process he has given us some rare atrocious gems to savour. These in turn have provided Burton with enough material to make a Grade A' film that celebrates the life of Wood and shows him as a man with a vision who was prepared to realise it at any cost. Finally we get to see that vision as it was originally intended. Quite simply this film is a masterpiece.",10,0,0,15 May 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The Force is Strong
","The force returns with a bang in Episode II, and the traditional elements that made the Star Wars saga so popular are here to savour. The film features the usual battle of good and evil, although this time there is a more sinister subtext which lends the film greater depth and emotional resonance. Although acting has never been the saga's strong point, the performances here serve their purposes and the characterisations are well rounded. With breathtaking action set pieces and awe inspiring visual effects, Lucas has put the saga back on track after the blandness of Episode I and sets things up nicely for Episode III.",6,0,0,16 May 2002
Singin' in the Rain," Spectacular
","Everybody knows Gene Kelly singing and dancing in the films title number, but this is just one of the many magical musical numbers in this epic piece of blissful entertainment. Set during the turbulent period when Hollywood was converting from silent films to sound, Singin' in the Rain' is a perfect example of everything that is good and right about movie-making. Gene Kelly in his greatest role is an all singing, all dancing sensation and his acting is pretty damn good too. Donald O'Connor excels as his exuberant sidekick and almost steals the show with the unsurpassed Make em Laugh'. Debbie Reynolds is feisty and sexy as Kelly's love interest, while Jean Hagen gives one of the screen's greatest supporting performances as the horrid Lena Lamont, a silent screen goddess whose voice will just not cut it in talkies.The musical numbers flow fast and furious as Gene and Donald perform amazing feats of choreography with Fit as a Fiddle' and Moses Supposes' while Good Mornin' will have you dancing in the aisles. If Singin' in the Rain' had no musical numbers it would still be a contender for the funniest film ever made. The problems with experiments with sound films are painfully funny, and Kelly's silent sparring with the demonic Hagen is hilarious. The accolade of sheer perfection can be conferred on few films, and such a title is perhaps even an understatement in this case. And never before did rain look like so much fun.",Null,17,22,8 March 2003
Titanic," Boy meets Girl, Ship meets Iceberg
","The most expensive movie of all time and the most successful of all time is a marvel of spectacle yet minimal on substance. Cameron's magnum opus has every element you'd expect from a Hollywood epic  romance, tragedy, historical grandeur, lavish sets and costumes, eye popping set pieces, and of course sexy actors  but somehow manages to achieve great results with the smallest amount of subtlety. The film begins in modern day Nova Scotia where a marine archaeologist (Paxton) stumbles across some tattered drawings whilst exploring the wreck of the famous ship for a priceless diamond. The drawing is that of a naked young woman who appears to be wearing the proverbial diamond of great price, and when Paxton's find is broadcast on TV it sparks off some memories in 101 year old Rose Calvert (Stewart). It transpires that Rose Calvert was in fact the socialite Rose DeWitt-Bukater who was supposed to have gone down with the ship some 84 years earlier. Of course that was not the case, and Cameron's film gives her the opportunity to set the record straight. In 1912 she was going to America to wed her thuggish fiancé Caloden Hockley (Zane), when in mid Atlantic she decides to throw off the shackles of her upper class oppressors and jump ship in a manner of speaking. Then she meets her knight in shining armour Jack Dawson (DiCaprio), a down on his luck travelling artist who saves her in every way a person can be saved (cue nauseating plot line). So they meet, he shows her the ways of the world by taking her to a party in steerage class, she leaves her fiancé, he teaches her to fly, paints her in the nude, they have sex, the ship sinks, he dies and her heart goes on  and on and on and on. So essentially it is just your classic tale of boy meets girl, ship meets iceberg. Despite all the hype and hoopla, Titanic' is quite a mesmerising piece of work that delivers an endless series of thumps to the heart while provide little if any food for thought. Although the characters are essentially black and white morally unambiguous personages, and the actor's thespian talents are not really challenged by the roles, and the dialogue has patches is purely prosaic (note when DiCaprio overhears the that the ship will sink he comments `This is bad'  very observant), the film has a great deal to compliment it. The opening underwater sequences are as eye catching as anything ever committed to celluloid, the vast shots of the ship in motion are breathtaking, and the attention to detail of the ship's interiors are flawless. However hackneyed the script may be, DiCaprio and Winslet inject their limited characters with endless charm, and the romantic romp is a shamelessly enjoyable roller coaster of fun and frolics. Yet it is only when the ship collides with the berg that the film kicks into first gear. The panic, terror and heartbreak of the sinking is viscerally recreated in all its gory horror, proving once and for all that James Cameron is the world's foremost director of action sequences. The aftermath is equally appalling, having to be seen to be believed.With a running time in excess of three hours this film could do with being a little shorter, and some of the sequences featuring the two leads trapped in the bowels of the sinking ship are excessive. Against its predecessor the highly commendable A Night To Remember', Titanic' can hold its own, primarily for its brutal depiction of the ship's final hours, however it has neither the historical accuracy nor the emotional depth of the former. Criticisms aside, Titanic' is the movie that will reinvent blockbusters for the 21st century, and while it is about a subtle as a hole in the head  or the hull if you must   you will not be likely to see a bigger film for many years to come.",9,1,3,15 May 2001
Stalag 17," Underrated? - understatement!
","In his lengthy and eventful career, Billy Wilder created many films that have rightly attained classic status, but his WWII prisoner of war comedy-drama Stalag 17 is arguably one of his best. The scripting is a perfect example of how to marry a tight plot with sharp dialogue and great characters, and the acting is flawless on all counts. While William Holden's performance as the cynical American sergeant rightly won him an Oscar, it is the comic antics of Robert Strauss and Harvey Lembeck that steal the show. And if there was ever a more entertaining ensemble of previously unseen (and sadly subsequently unheard of) supporting players - with the possible exception of Casablanca - I would love to see it. This film predates the more famous WWII pow film The Great Escape by more than a decade, but had Wilder, Holden and company not caused havoc in Stalag 17, the world would never have seen Steve McQueen play the cooler king with such wry aplomb. Stalag 17 is easily one of the finest films of its time, if not of all time, and I would encourage anyone who has never experienced its unique blend of cynicism, comedy, suspense and drama to check it out at the earliest available opportunity.",10,77,96,28 February 2000
The Shawshank Redemption," Poetry in Motion Pictures
","Getting to see The Shawshank Redemption was for me a lengthy process, but when I finally caught it it was more than worth the wait. In the history of movies there have been many impressive debuts from promising directors. With The Shawshank Redemption, Frank Darabont has vaulted himself into the ranks of Orson Welles and John Huston. There has not been a more memorable movie experience in the last decade, and it gratifies me to see that users of this site regard this film as highly as it ought to be.",10,0,0,27 February 2000
