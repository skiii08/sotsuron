Sucker Punch," Sucker Punch
","I've read many reviews on this film and honestly don't understand some of the criticism. I saw this movie recently and have to say that it was just as beautifully entertaining as I'd expect a Zack Snyder film to be. The story is great and its there if only its audience pays attention. It's not a hard movie to follow, trust me. From the very beginning the film moves right along without taking unnecessary breaks or pulling its audience from the story. Everything from the music to the introduction of key characters was well conveyed. The direction of the plot is fairly obvious from the start so its viewer isn't stumbling on confusing side stories or any other form of useless information. Sucker Punch was stunning and thoroughly enjoyable to say the least. It is an action packed thrill ride that takes a very basic plot line and turns it into something you can watch over and over again. Thank you once again Zack Snyder.",10,7,16,25 March 2011
