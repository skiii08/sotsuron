The Ring," Riveting Horror
","I simply loved The Ring. It's an incessantly entertaining horror film that will give you goosebumps every time you watch it. It will be hard to sleep that night.That, however, is not what I loved about this film. I loved the plot and the mystery that the main character (Naomi Watts) is trying to uncover. The ending, although scary, is very satisfying, and leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat. The Ring is a million times better than its cheesy sequel, The Ring Two. I loved this film, I must have watched it a million times after I bought it on DVD. My parents kept asking 'Didn't you just watch that?' And I did. Over and over. To get the thrills and chills, to see the terrific performances, and to experience the ominous mystery of 'The Ring'.",10,1,1,3 July 2007
United 93," Very powerful, disturbing at some parts.
","A powerful film. I saw it last week and was moved by it. It tells the truth. It may not know exactly what happened, but you have that documentary-type feel in your body. You feel like you're really there, there with the doomed passengers. There with the brave men and women who fought to stop United 93 from hitting it's target, the White House. And stop it they did, but not from crashing. I thought United 93's method of it crashing was very effective. Instead of a big explosion and effects, once the plane hits the ground, the screen goes black. After the film was finished, no one in the theater said anything. I mean no one. Everyone was completely silent. I highly recommend this excellent film, but it is disturbing at some parts, and it is not for younger viewers. A definite 4/4.",10,0,2,21 May 2006
Kung Fu Panda," FilmCreature Reviews 'Kung Fu Panda'
","According to Wikipedia, 'China has one of the longest histories of continuously recorded martial arts tradition of any society in the world, and with hundreds of styles probably the most varied. Over the past two to four thousand years, many distinctive styles have been developed, each with its own set of techniques and ideas.' One of the coolest things about Kung Fu Panda is that it seems to celebrate some of these individual styles, representing them with its own animal. The animated martial arts in the film is lithe and mesmerizing; surprisingly sharp for a kids movie. Teens, parents, and kung fu fanatics will all get their money's worth with this high-spirited and high-energy flick.The plot is obvious. A fat, lazy panda (voiced by a precisely cast Jack Black) gets a chance to prove his worth as the 'Dragon Warrior' who will save China from the wicked snow leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane). In order to do this, he must be trained by Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), a deceptively small red panda who has trained the greatest kung fu warriors in all China, the Furious Five, voiced by (*deep breath*) Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogen, Lucy Liu, and David Cross. Of course, they all expected to be chosen to be the Dragon Warrior, and here's Chub Fu to take away the coveted prize.The voice talents are mostly generic. The exceptions would be Jack Black, who brings a slacker panda reminiscent of Kevin Smith comedy to life almost flawlessly, and Dustin Hoffman, doing such a good job as Master Shifu that you won't even recognize his gravely enunciation unless you listen closely.I recommend 'Kung Fu Panda'. Everyone'll have a blast. Even if it's predictable to the very end, the characters are all likable, and the film has a cartoony animation style but still looks gorgeous.3/4",8,3,6,21 June 2008
Underworld," FilmCreature Reviews 'Underworld'
","'Underworld' is a film totally misunderstood by critics nationwide. This is not the kind of movie you take seriously. You will not weep or be shaken with emotion. Instead, with the right mindset (and surrounded by friends each with a bowl of popcorn) you might just have a fun time watching it.Kate Beckinsale does some great work here. This is no Academy Award-winning (or even Saturn Award-winning) character play, but Selene is such a sleek, lethal vamp that we can't help but just love her to death. Bill Nighy does great things with his vamp as well; Viktor is one of those great villains that Satan would flee from (yes, I just quoted Ebert). Scott Speedman is effective but not amazing. As for Shane Brolly...just try to ignore him. And finally, the lovely Sophia Myles. I actually liked her character quite a lot; her conniving, quietly lustful vampire Erika is great, but I would have liked to have seen more of her scheming ways.'Underworld' is obvious campy, but it's not boring, which is the number one thing it has going for it. Boring camp is tragic and awful at the same time, but 'Underworld', fortunately, has some nice performances and great effects, and the Gothic environments conjure up memories of 'Dark City' and 'The Matrix' in which no place is safe. Not even for a super-powered vampire princess.3/4",8,1,2,15 January 2008
Shaun of the Dead," Very entertaining, very funny...the first time
","A very entertaining and very funny film. Not as funny as expected (I had pretty high expectations) but very funny, especially when Shaun is so oblivious to the zombies around him. The gore is very satisfying too. I loved this movie. My brother wasn't all that excited about it, but then again, he liked Night at the Museum, so I'll discard his review. The relentless gore made it even funnier. I sort of wasn't that bummed when Ed died, he was kind of annoying anyway, although I was surprised that they killed him off, I think they thought he was actually funny or something.You actually sense something going on with Shaun and his babe. Great acting from Simon Pegg and Kate Ashfield.Funny, but not very re-watchable.7 mauled Englishmen out of 10.",7,0,2,28 May 2006
Madagascar," OK, decent.
","'Madagascar' was a very so-so film. It was fun at some parts, but it was mostly a mediocre animated movie. I went into the theater expecting Nemo or Ice Age, not this. I'd had a good impression of DreamWorks animations ever since I saw 'Shrek', but I was disappointed at this film. There was some funny parts, but it wasn't that great.It's about four animal friends who live comfortably in the Central Park Zoo (which happens to not exist in real life) until Marty the zebra decides he wants to go live back at his real home in Africa. His friends tag along. They get caught and sent back to Africa, but the boat is hijacked by maniacal penguins who knock out the crewmen. The boxes containing the animals are dumped overboard, and they get stranded, guess where? That's right, Madagascar. Gee, that wasn't predictable. The movie will probably be enjoyable for younger viewers, which I am not. There are a few funny parts, but overall it was a so-so film. My suggestion: rent it, or better yet, get it from the library. Maybe.2/4",5,2,3,21 May 2006
Finding Nemo," FilmCreature Reviews 'Finding Nemo'
","I don't know anyone who didn't enjoy this film to the fullest extent. It was the best film I saw that year. I'm happy to say what many, many critics have said: Pixar's done it again. All of their films have been delightfully imaginative and funny. This is their best film yet. On rottentomatoes.com, 100% of the top critics gave thumbs-up to this movie! 100%! That's Richard Roeper, Roger Ebert, David Ansen... and so on. You WILL love this film. It's so charming and lovable, and the computer graphics of the ocean are stunning and beautiful, your eyes are glued to the screen. I thought the best voice of the incredibly talented cast was definitely Ellen DeGeneres. DeGeneres voices her perfectly, with lots of humor, wit, and and a pinch of needed stupidity (not Ellen, Dory) for the voice.This is a gorgeous, enormously enjoyable movie. As Ebert would say, Thumbs Way Up!!!4/4",10,0,2,29 June 2006
Juno," FilmCreature Reviews 'Juno'
","Juno MacGuff is a sarcastic, cynical, tomboyish teen played by Ellen Page in a fantastic, perfectly tuned performance. After sort-of-spontaneous (but not really) sex with her best friend, Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera of 'Superbad'), Juno receives an unwanted package--a pregnancy. Woops.Juno decides to give her baby to an affluent couple, Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner). All seems well at first, but it will be a bumpy road until birth.I can spend hours gushing about how terrific a movie 'Juno' is, but I'm not really the greatest writer on the planet, so I'll just express the fact that 'Juno' has a strange effect on you. After seeing it, I almost felt as if I would walk out of the theater and see Juno MacGuff just standing there, as if she were a regular living, breathing teenager. That's how good Page is. In fact, every single performance in the film is absolutely tremendous. I liked how Allison Janney's stepmom character isn't turned into a whiny she-demon like most formula stepmoms, instead, she's far more friendlier (if a little unsure of Juno's odd ways) than we would ever expect. And J.K. Simmons finally gets a role where he isn't a total jerk; instead, he's a sensitive father who truly cares for his wacky daughter.The soundtrack is awesome, I'll be buying it as soon as possible. The wait for the DVD will be truly agonizing, but worth it in the end. We can see the chain reactions here when a group of truly ambitious individuals (such as Jason Reitman, Diablo Cody, and Ellen Page) get together and make a movie such as this. I don't think I've ever seen anything like it.I give 'Juno' my highest recommendation possible. Sweeeeet, man. 4/4",10,403,757,31 December 2007
Spider-Man 3," FilmCreature Reviews 'Spider-Man 3'
","While I start out with a rather unprofessional title here, I assure you, it's exactly what I thought of this sickly, pathetic new addition to the 'Spider-Man' series. It is obviously crucial that I start out the review by mentioning that I liked the first two films (both 8/10's). I think Maguire was terrifically cast, the special effects are terrific, and I liked the sweet, loving relationship between Peter and MJ. But the third film in the series is like gasoline poured into your favorite glass of milk. It fails utterly and miserably.I am awarding it a 4 out of 10 for one reason only: the stupendous special effects. Although the effects will no doubt be beaten by the likes of 'The Golden Compass' and 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End', the Sony team does a stellar job of bringing Venom, the Sandman, and Evil Harry to life.Now. Let's talk crap.The dialog and relationship between Peter Parker and MJ is grossly miscalculated. When Peter missed poor dear MJ's play in the second film, I actually felt distressed about it. Now, when MJ is ordered by Evil Harry to break up with Peter, it's a barely painful scene to watch. By now, Peter has become so whiny and predictable, I wish he would just hook up with Ursula and be done with it. Just kidding.But still, it gets annoying after a while. I feel like I would rather have someone like Jake Gyllenhaal playing Spidey now. Maguire is tired out.And there's also one awful, inexplicably and shockingly stupid scene involving Spidey and his nearly erotic connection to his new black suit. It seems as though the suit not only makes his greedy and extremely powerful, but it also serves as a tool for lusting after beautiful women. This leads to the formerly mentioned awful, inexplicably stupid and shocking scene where Peter/Spidey decides to go onto the sidewalk and dance the day away. Literally, dance. And make suggestive gestures as attractive women.I chuckle as I imagine the stupefied expressions on the audiences faces as they watch this unbelievably idiotic scene.But hey, cheer up. There's one scene in the movie that works perfectly. It's after The Sandman (Thomas Haden Church overacting) escapes from prison, and meets up with his angered wife and still-loving daughter. That scene is sweet and realistic, and it works very, very well.But the rest...just doesn't. Resist the temptation of that shiny cover, and instead pick up the DVD copy of 'Waitress', a much more funny, touching, and real movie than this one.1.5/4",4,1,2,6 January 2008
Final Destination 2," FilmCreature Reviews 'Final Destination 2'
","Final Destination is worth the full 5/10 that I have given it, as it is mediocrity at its finest. The deaths designed for each of the characters are clever and kind of funny, I found myself laughing more than jumping.However, I didn't like how they killed off Ali Larter's character from the original, to be honest, I would rather have had Kimberly or the cop die.Yeah, it has the same signature violent deaths from the first one, but this one isn't nearly as authentic or suspenseful, and the performances aren't that great.So I give FD2 a 2/4, for being a flawed yet kind of entertaining horror flick.",5,1,3,28 August 2007
The Italian Job," FilmCreature Reviews 'The Italian Job' (2003)
","I didn't expect much from 'The Italian Job;' and I didn't get much. But what I did get was good: an entertaining, generally well-acted action film with all the right stars. Two Academy-Award nominees, and one Academy Award-winning Charlize Theron.The film starts with a heist worth $35 million. Then, of course, something goes awry. A member of the thieving team betrays everyone else by stealing the money and killing their oldest member, John Bridger. With revenge in mind, Mark Wahlberg and the gang decide to steal that money back. They manage to hire Charlize Theron to work for them (she plays Bridger's daughter, Stella).So, that's the plot. You can guess what happens; good guys win, bad guys lose. What's new? Well, how some really great chase scenes, and a terrifically satisfying ending? Good enough for me.7 Mini Coopers out of 10.",7,0,2,21 November 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," FilmCreature Reviews 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'
","The computer FX in this movie are stunning and not overdone. Director Peter Jackson hires the now-famous WETA Workshop to create frightening creatures and vast, wondrous environments. The action in this first LOTR film is very satisfying, and the acting is good as well. Elijah Wood plays Frodo, a young 'hobbit' (short little dude) who is destined to destroy the cursed Ring that has plagued Middle Earth for thousands of years.Frodo will be guided by the wise wizard Gandolf (Golden Globe-winner Ian McKellan), and aided by a fellowship of warriors, including Aragorn, the ranger in love with an elf (Liv Tyler), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), an archer elf, and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) a plump dwarf who can kick your a$$ with an ax. And it has some other humans and hobbits and Hugo Weaving and stuff.A magical movie to be watched again and again.",10,0,3,7 July 2007
Van Helsing," Good Special Effects, Everything Else Is Really, Really Bad
","I give Van Helsing a 2/10 because it has some great special effects from Industrial Lights & Magic, but the rest stinks. The acting is bad, the movie is boring, the whole project was really disappointing for me; I was really looking forward to seeing this. Hugh Jackman is a great actor, see him in top acting condition in The Prestige and Happy Feet.I suppose I should tell the storyline, which I barely remember. It deals with Dracula and his three wives who make lots of little baby-vamps to take over the world. It has something to do with Frankenstein, too. Uh, yeah. So it's got great special effects, but overall, it's a terrible movie. 1/2 star.",2,1,1,29 June 2007
Ocean's Eleven," FilmCreature Reviews 'Ocean's Eleven'
","Ocean's Eleven is a charming, fun-filled heist movie. George Clooney is great as Danny Ocean, a thief who decides to rob three casinos at once with his team of expert criminals. The bank owner (Andy Garcia) is a ruthless man who will stop at nothing to keep his money in his wallet.Several stars join the fun, including Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, and Julia Roberts. It adds up to a good heist thriller I am glad to have seen...once. As I said, it's creative and entertaining, but it just didn't give me enough to keep me waiting eagerly for the sequel (which turned out to be pretty bad).I give Ocean's Eleven a 3/4.",8,0,1,6 July 2007
Seabiscuit," FilmCreature Reviews 'Seabiscuit'
","I am surprised that Seabiscuit received such praising reviews. One critic called it the best film of the year. It clearly is not. I did not like this movie. It has quality it how the sets and costumes were designed, but I simply did not like the movie. I finished it feeling gloomy and unsatisfied.I will say that Jeff Bridges and Chris Cooper are stellar in this movie. Tobey Maguire plays a crabby teenager who befriends an equally crabby horse. We do not much like either of them; I personally could have cared less what happened to them (like I gave a damn about the big final race). Now Bridges' character, I cared about, I didn't want anything bad to happen to him. Chris Cooper plays a horse-wranglin' cowboy who basically becomes Bridges' little horse assistant.There is excellent acting here by Cooper and Bridges, but this movie seems to have been made by crusty old men. I know quality when I see it, and it is here, but I simply cannot praise a movie that is so...unlikable.2/4",5,1,3,7 July 2007
Cars," I don't get it...!
","I just don't get how this movie got such stellar reviews. In a world where Cars gets better fan review than Happy Feet and A Bug's Life, no one can be safe. Cars is long, boring, and uneventful. The main character, Lightning McQueen, gets stuck in a boring old desert town called Radiator Springs. His further adventures make up the movie.The animation is stellar, and there are a few good moments, especially with Paul Newman's raggedy old car Doc Hudson. But the movie spends too long establishing the story with the audience, and overall it's a bore. Don't waste your time with this, go watch Happy Feet or Finding Nemo, two massively better animated films. 6 shiny cars out of 10.",6,1,2,29 June 2007
Ghost Rider," Bleh...
","To start, I'd just like to say that this movie is terrible. It has horrible acting and graphics and it's incredibly cheesy. Now I'm going to tell you another truth: people will eat it up. They will probably love it in all of its campy goodness. I mildly, very mildly, enjoyed it. But Ghost Rider tries for too many things, and Eva Mendes really sucks in this movie. I'm sorry, but she is such a bad actress, she's up there with Catherine Zeta-Jones as a hot actress who shouldn't be an actress. So anyway, if you're a normal person, you'll probably like it. But if you critique movies regularly, you'll probably hate it. Very cheesy, badly acted, bad graphics, and it has Eva Mendes. Thumbs down.5 flammable motorcycles out of 10.",5,0,2,28 June 2007

","You'd think you can't improve on a 10/10 movie, but this one does, with great action and characters. There isn't much else to say about the special effects that I didn't already in my first review, they're still fantastic. Peter Jackson doesn't treat this like a sequel, it's just the continuing story of heroes battling the forces of evil.Frodo, now alone except for his buddy Sam (Sean Astin), is on his epic journey to Mount Mordor to destroy The One Ring. He'll encounter Gollum, a wretched creature who's definitely up to something.And meanwhile Aragorn and friends are trying to protect the little country of Rohan from imminent destruction from the newly-bred Uruk-Hai, vicious monsters crossed with man and elf.4/4.

Children of Men," FilmCreature Reviews 'Children of Men'
","I loved Children of Men. It is a fantastic movie and it deserved every award it received. Clive Owen is perfect as Theo Faron, a man who is given the task of transporting the only pregnant woman in the world to a secret organization that can help her.That's right--the only pregnant woman. Women have mysteriously become infertile, and the world is a living hell. Bombing and rioting happen every day. Theo is just a normal man, trying to make a life out of the dung heap the world has become. Until he meets Kee, who is pregnant.This is one of the best films I've ever seen. My friend and I watched on the computer and we were both sucked in. It's action-packed, emotionally affecting, and has fantastic performances.4/4",10,3,11,7 July 2007
Mulholland Drive," FilmCreature Reviews 'Mulholland Dr.'
","'Mulholland Drive' is actually a sad, beautiful love story in the guise of a thriller. This film will leave you completely tongue-tied after watching it. I doubt anyone ever figured out the plot on first viewing. There are lots of theories about the film being a dream, and other's where it's not. And there are some where a character is alive, and another where they are, in fact, dead.So, it will take a while to figure out, but that's the absolute genius of it. Only an absolute master could craft such a film. Kudos also to the excellent cast, especially the leading ladies, Naomi Watts and Laura Harring.I love this film, and if you look at it the right way you will love it too. It is, in my opinion, one of the greatest films ever made.4/4",10,3,7,6 October 2007
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," FilmCreature Reviews 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1'
","First off, I'm going to tell you that Kill Bill is the most violent movie I have ever seen. It crosses all boundaries. Actually, it beheads, dismembers, and slaughters all boundaries. It is super-violent, gory fun.Uma Thurman, in my opinion, should have been nominated for an Academy Award for her stellar performance as The Bride, a woman whose entire bridal party was massacred by Bill (David Carradine), her former lover, and his team of assassins. The Bride wakes up after four years in a coma, and finds the baby she once had is gone. So she sets out on a quest for vengeance against all those who wronged her by killing all she cared about. She does so in bloody, exciting action sequences with a nice, big samurai sword obtained from a master swordmaker (Sonny Chiba).This is a great, ridiculously violent movie filled with the signature, hilarious Tarantino dialogue and action.",9,0,3,9 July 2007
Groundhog Day," FilmCreature Reviews 'Groundhog Day'
","I love Groundhog Day. I'm glad I just saw it recently, now that I'm older I enjoy it so much more. I liked GD the first time I saw it as a kid, then I saw it as a teen, and absolutely loved it. I immediately purchased it from GameStop, and have watched it at least ten times since then.Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell are both fantastic. Murray plays the lead role of Phil Connors, a prima donna weatherman who fancies himself quite the celebrity. He's doing his hated annual report on the Groundhog Day celebration in Punxatawney, Pennsylvania. Phil goes to bed and wakes up on Groundhog Day. He does the report, and then while trying to leave Punxatawney, he and his crew get stuck in a blizzard. They are forced to go back to Punxatawney.So that they do, and Phil goes to sleep in his nice, warm bed... And when he wakes up the next day, it's GROUNDHOG DAY! Again. He finds it all a little weird.Then he wakes up the next day...And the next day...And the next day...Only to find that it is Groundhog Day again and again. Phil desperately tries to find a solution to this conundrum of his, all while trying to win the heart of the beautiful Rita (MacDowell).This is a fantastic comedy classic directed by Harold Ramis (who has a cameo--he's the brain doctor). Overall, this movie is awesome, and can be enjoyed again and again with the whole family.4/4",10,0,2,10 August 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," I Have Changed My Mind
","I really didn't like this movie the first time I saw it. I thought it was badly acted and boring. But now I've watched it again, after watching the first two films in a row, and I have to say, this one is the best.The acting is, in fact, the best in all the series. As I watched the beginning trilogy, I noticed Ewan MacGregor's acting gradually improving with each film. Hayden Christensen is awful, but this news isn't exactly new. After watching this film, we can finally be at peace, for at least we can hear James Earl Jones' intimidating baritone voice instead of Christensen's annoying, whiny voice.The romance scenes, of course, are awful, but we've gotten used to that. The special effects are fantastic. The action is exhilarating. It's a nice finish to the first trilogy, and it's the best of the first trilogy as well.And if you're simply dying to see Natalie Portman, I would suggest picking up V for Vendetta and Anywhere But Here instead.7 dead Jedi out of 10.",7,0,3,28 May 2006
Iron Man," FilmCreature Reviews 'Iron Man'
","Quick review here.You can breathe, fanboys. 'Iron Man' lives up the the hype (unlike that godawful '300'). Robert Downey, Jr. is effective and funny as Tony Stark the profiteer-turned-mechanical-superhero. The action scenes are truly awesome. Gwyneth Paltrow and Terrence Howard's poorly written roles are outdone by their finely tuned performances. (Although I did laugh harder at Paltrow's 'hohoba' rant in 'Proof' than at any time in 'Iron Man'.) Jeff Bridges is especially good (in an equally bad role), as the John Malkovich/Darth Bill Gates villain.It does seem at times that the screenplay only requires clever dialogue for Downey's character. This nearly lethal habit gets annoying after a bit (I mean after the first five minutes).'Iron Man' is doesn't contain anything new or original, but the performances are excellent, the special effects are exhilarating and groundbreaking, and the inept screenplay does have its moments with some clever dialogue. This is stuff for a particular audience, if you get what I mean.2.5/4",6,1,3,9 May 2008
The Sixth Sense," FilmCreature Reviews 'The Sixth Sense'
","M. Night Shymalan actually makes a good movie with this supernatural thriller starring Bruce Willis as a child therapist assigned to a boy with an amazing gift. Haley Joel Osment is awesome as Cole Sear, the little boy who can see dead people.Cole's visions are disturbing, but the film is not scary or suspenseful. What gives it the edge and my thumbs up are the fantastic performances. Osment and Toni Collette are both Oscar material. Collette plays his mother, Lynn, who is struggling to understand her child, but still loves him with all of her heart.So, fantastic performances give The Sixth Sense a 3/4.",8,1,1,7 July 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," FilmCreature Reviews 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'
","The Return of the King is the spectacular finale to the already fantastic first two movies in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This one is the best.Aragorn takes the lead role this time, as he faces his destiny to become the king of Gondor. Gollum (motion-captured Andy Serkis) is becoming a big problem for Sam (Sean Astin), as Frodo is beginning to trust the creature more than Sam himself.And Pippin (Billy Boyd) pledges his allegiance to Denethor (John Noble), the crabby and evil stand-in leader of Gondor. Denethor doesn't have the best attitude in the world, such as when he tries to burn his own son alive. The ending is very long, but it isn't bad. The entire movie is riveting, magical cinema, and I ate up every minute of it. The Return of the King is a masterpiece, and of course it grossed hundreds of millions no doubt (more than that, actually).4/4",10,6,9,7 July 2007
The Matrix," FilmCreature reviews 'The Matrix'
","Keanu Reeves, who has been dubbed as one of the worst actors of our time, is actually extremely well-cast in 'The Matrix', one of 1999's most enjoyable and imaginative thrillers. He plays Thomas Anderson, a young man who lives his life in computers under the hacker pseudonym Neo. He feels an emptiness inside of him, a cold darkness that he cannot explain but he is determined to find out its source. His journey begins when he is contacted by the voluptuous hacker Trinity (yes, *the* Trinity who cracked the IRS d-base). He presents her with a question.'What is the Matrix?' As it turns out, The Matrix is the very world we live in, which essentially lives up to be one big computer program whose purpose is to serve a rogue A.I. that harvests our corpses for fuel. Fun, fun, fun. Carrie-Anne Moss, one of my favorite, down-to-earth actresses, is terrific as the sexy human agent Trinity. She seems like someone you would fear but then run to for protection a second later. Reeves is a great hero as Neo. Laurence Fishburne took his performance from this better-than-average sci-fi and directly copied to into a smarter, better movie, titled 'Akeelah and the Bee'. He plays Morpheus, who is essentially Neo's Obi-Wan; a wise, methodical, prophet who happens to tote huge guns and the strength to break handcuffs (and bones).The fight sequences are glorious fun, the film is rarely predictable, and the performances are tuned just right. Even though it gets weighed down with clichÃ©s near the end, 'The Matrix' is well worth seeing (it visually LOOKS fantastic), or even owning a copy.3/4",8,0,1,6 February 2008
Princess Mononoke," FilmCreature Reviews 'Princess Mononoke'
","The first time I saw this movie, I was going to give it a 9/10, but now that I have watched it several more times, I see the epic scale of it all. The animation is just beautiful. Wondrous. Hayao Miyazaki is a genius. I love the story, it's like an ancient tale told through the ages.The story begins with Ashitaka (voiced by Billy Crudup) battling a giant demon. It turns out to be a huge boar covered with black, evil worm-like creatures. Some of the creatures wrap themselves around Ashitaka's arm, and he is infected. 'Though you cannot change your fate,' he is told by the village wise woman, 'you may rise to meet it.' So Ashitaka begins a journey to be cured of this infection by the mysterious forest spirit, a glorious creature you must see for yourself. Along the way, he battles samurai and makes a stop in Irontown, ruled by the ruthless Lady Eboshi (Minnie Driver), and encounters a monk named Jigo, who gives him advice and is friendly towards him. For now.This movie is a fantastic animated masterpiece, as beautiful as Spirited Away in story, and even more beautiful in its epic animation.4/4",10,2,4,9 July 2007
