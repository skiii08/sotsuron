E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," One of the greatest movies back in theaters and still good after all these years
","E.T. is back and better than ever. This is one of the few movies I own that I always wondered how it would be like to see it in theaters. Well I finally got my chance and WOW. I own the original on video and loved it as a kid and still love it now (by the way I'm 15 years old). Spielberg, one of the greatest directors of all time took a big risk in a making a family movie about a boy and an alien. If this movie were made today, it would most likely flop because no one would think it would look interesting. Spielberg knows how to make a movie. He put all the great elements in a great movie: Drama, comedy, tearjerkering. If there any aspiring directors (ahem Peter Jackson) I would suggest you watch at least three of Spielberg's classic movies like E.T., Schindler's List, or any of the Indiana Jones films.10/10 (20th anniversery edition) 10/10 (for original)",10,1,2,24 March 2002
As Good as It Gets," A funny romantic comedy
","As Good as it Gets was really a funny romantic comedy just like I expected. The movie focuses around the character of Melvin (Jack Nicholson) a superstitous, bigot, and writer. He then meets a waitress (Helen Hunt) and his gay neighbor (Greg Kinnear) and they all form a friendship with each other. As Good as it Gets got me hooked from the start. I like Jack Nicholson and Greg Kinnear. The two are paired with Helen Hunt and what comes out is a great, romantic comedy. There are some parts that are draggy but everything else is just great.9/10",9,0,0,27 August 2001
Memento," A truly original great movie
","As I was about to watch Memento, I was worried that I may not like it because it makes you really think. Boy was I wrong. I liked how the director started from the end and ended at the beginging. I liked how it showed a scene that is not explained until the next scene and it made you think what happened. What a truly original and great movie.10/10",10,0,1,25 January 2002
Beauty and the Beast," A re-release but one of the best films of the year
","While just about everyone is bragging about how great Lord of the Rings is and how its now their favorite film and best film of all time, they certainly forgot the real movies like Beauty and the Beast. This movie has some of the best music and best animation I have ever seen. When you see this on the IMAX, it is almost a whole new experience seeing this movie on film. Even though it's a re-release, I think it is one of the best movies of the year 2002.10/10",10,5,5,20 January 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," My 2nd of the whole trilogy and one of the BEST movies of the year!!
","Star Wars Episode II was one of the most anticipated movies I was waiting for. Plus when I heard about this new digital projection, my mouth litteraly dropped. The day came when I saw the movie in DLP. I left the movie with eyes wide dry from not even closing my eyes. The movie was amazing. The special effects are 100% Oscar calibur, the acting was good (especially from Ewan who is now one of my top 10 actors), and the action scenes were spectacular. Hayden Christensen was good as the soon-to-be evil Anakin. The dialogue was acceptable (yes there were some cheezy lines, but hey what about Lord of the Rings?) Oh and Christopher Lee is the master of evil. He was excellent. And Yoda, move over Ah-nold, Stallone etc. thus nearly 2 million year old man has out done you. I also saw it in the regular film version which was good, but the EFX wasn't as good as it was in the DLP. Overall one of the best films of the year, Oscars are going home with it no doubt, and can't wait for Episode III. Lucas your a GOD.10/10",10,0,1,3 June 2002
"Monsters, Inc."," Funnier than Shrek but not a better movie
","Monsters Inc. was no doubt a funny movie, with great animation. The movie focuses on two monsters: Sullivan (John Goodman) and Mike (Billy Crystal). They work for Monsters Inc., a company that is the source of a monster city. It controls everything from lights to water. They get all this energy from children's screams. When one child accidently enters the monster city, Mike and Sullivan try to get this child back to her world. But Randall (Steve Buscemi), an evil monster wants to use the child for his experiment to become the top monster for Monsters Inc. This movie is funny for all ages from 1-1000+. The reason why I think Shrek is a better movie is because Shrek seemed more realistic in animation and to be honest, acting. I still recommend this movie to all people.10/10",10,0,1,16 November 2001
Fargo," Two words: Good movie
","Fargo is no doubt one of the best movies ever made. The movie is about a car salesman (William Macy) who is up to his arms in debt. He then hires two men (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stromare) to kidnap his wife and get her father, who is rich to pay a 'ransom' amount of $1 million. When all goes wrong, a pregnant police officer (Frances McDormand), goes out to find the kidnappers and bring them in for justice. The movie was just great. Some parts were funny (mainly the accents when they said Ja!), some were dramatic, and other parts thrilling. No doubt I recommend this movie to everyone. Also for Bruce Campbell fans (like me) he appears at the end.10/10",10,0,0,19 November 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Not as good as everyone says
","I just want to make one thing clear. I have never read any of the LOTR books or had any previous knowledge of it. LOTR is a great visual movie, but the movie itself is not that great. I thought the movie didn't very much dwell on the story line. It also got off track with scenes they didn't need to have (i.e. Cate Blanchett's character). The acting was pretty good from Lee, McKellan, Astin, and Wood but the other characters didn't seem to have the emotions and feelings as the four actors mentioned above. I no doubt think this movie can win an Oscar for EFX, costumes, and cinematography, but I totally disagree that the movie can win Best Picture because it is not that type of a genre that wins an Oscar. Maybe part 2 and 3 will be better.8/10",2,1,2,27 December 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Truly one of the worst (well mostly overrated) films of all time
","When I went to see The Lord of the Rings: FOTR, the trailers no doubt looked interesting. When I saw the movie, I got a totally crap fest of a movie that wasn't even as good as the trailer. My reasons for hating are: 1. Why don't they just go to Mount whatever and destroy the Ring, instead of just blabbing about it how it takes over your mind. 2. What the heck was with that Gadriel character. First off she is blabbing nonsense about the smallest person can change and blah, blah, blah. Oh give me a break like I haven't heard that before. And please for the sequels turn off those lights of hers. Those 200+ watts in her almost made me blind. 3. The dialogue is cheezy okay. People I liked Star Wars II. I admit some of the diaglogue was crapy. But so was this. No one I don't care what frickkin Earth you live on, if your wizard, hobbit, mortal, etc No one ever says those lines like 'If you want him come and claim him' Ohh how breathtaking. 4. The acting. Don't get me started. The really one good, no GREAT person in this movie was Christopher Lee. He should've gotten the nod for best supporting actor not McKellan. Not to mention Wood's acting (thats how I can describe his acting, stiff as wood) and Astin (he must've taken lessons from Shatner for crying out loud) 5. The EFX were not amazing. The backround was but the EFX :cough: Gollum. As for the movie being overrated it that is a fact. Any movie that is not even out for year is put over movies that deserved their places like A Clockwork Orange, 2001, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, etc etc does not even deserve to be placed there. Also the actors are overrated (Wood, Astin and Bloom will never rank up to actors like Bruce Campbell, Harrison Ford and Ewan Mcgregor in a million light years) as well as the director (Jackson will never rank up to Kubrick, Spielberg, Raimi, etc in a 100000000+ million light years). I had put up another comment for this which was more praise but after thinking about I couldn't come to terms with this movie. I will no doubt see and hope the sequels are better (please be better dialoge, acting, and PLEASE NO MORE GADIREL)2/10 (Christopher Lee saved this craptacular movie by a LOT)",2,1,3,2 June 2002
American Psycho," One weird, though-provoking horror/thriller
","American Psycho is a horror/thriller and is one hell of a good film that made me think. The movie focuses around the life of Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) who when he is not cutting up and prostitutes, is instead doing his job on wall-street. American Psycho I thought was pretty different than any other horror, thriller, slasher,. etc. movies. This movie is really all of them put together in one good movie. When you watch this movie you think if these murders that Bateman is commiting are real or just his own imagination, his own fantasy. If they are real you wonder how does he just seem to get away with it. This movie has some impressive acting by both Christian Bale and Willem Dafoe. I reconmend this movie if your the kind of person who likes 'thinking' movies. If your not well maybe you will not like it as much.10/10",8,0,0,25 July 2001
American Psycho," Not really a horror movie
","American Psycho is really not a scary movie. I orignaly had a comment praising this film highly, well I change my mind. People, try to ignore that comment. I thought about this movie for a while and while the movie makes you wonder whether the people he kills are really murders or not, it doesn't scare the viewer. Yes the movie is at times thrilling, but not scary. Movies like The Evil Dead and Texas Chainsaw Massacre make you scream and hide in under your blanket. This movie didn't make me. I would personally not recommend this movie to horror fanatics because it is not horror really. If you want real horror, watch The Evil Dead and its sequels.8/10",8,0,1,10 December 2001
North by Northwest," A classic thriller
","North by Northwest is one heck of a thriller and movie. I think it maybe Hitchcock's best in my opinion. The movie is about an advertising salesman (Cary Grant) who gets mixed up in a murder he didn't commit. He then meets this lady (Eva Marie Saint). But can he trust her? This movie made my heart pound every second, especially the scene in the cornfield. I especially like the bright color of the film. Great movie.10/10",10,0,1,16 November 2001
The Patriot," Awesome!
","This was just awesome. This movie definitly beats out 1776 and Revolution. Not only does this movie tell about the war, it also tells all the hardships that people went through like seeing their families killed, innocents dying, and the whole lot. This movie is definitly one of my top favorites.",9,1,2,9 July 2000
Spider-Man," One of the best films of 2002, if not the best film
","Spider-man is another comic superhero to go to the big screen. The final result is a perfect film. Yeah that's LOTR fans. This is a perfect film. It has a great cast who do not disappoint at all. If at all Willem Dafoe should get a Best Supporting Actor nod. The EFX i though was good. I think the Oscars this should definitly get nods for are: Best Editing, Best Effects, Visual Effects, Best Effects, Sound Effects Editing,, Best Costume Design.10/10",10,0,0,5 May 2002
Dark City," One of the best scifi films ever made
","Dark City gives a whole new meaning to scifi in a good way. When John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) awakens in a strange hotel room, he finds that he is being hunted by an unknown species called the Strangers who posses the ability to stop time and alter reality. Murdoch seeks to unravel the twisted riddle of his identity. But in a city where reality is the ultimate illusion, discovering the truth could be fatal. Director Alex Proyas gives us a great plot which is being unraveled step by step. He gives us a lot of symbolism in the movie and with great special effects. There are so many good things about this movie that I could say but it would take me forever to finish. However I will say 3 of them. 1. The acting is incredible 2. The film is like a film-noir and scifi film put together which I liked and 3. The movie hardly deviates away from the plot.10/10",10,0,2,2 July 2001
Gandhi," One of the greatest movies based on a real person
",Next to Patton I think this is one of the greatest movies based on a real historical person. The movie is about a lawyer turned great leader. His name is Mohandas 'Mahatma' Gandhi (Ben Kingsley). He is a man who just wants India to break away from British rule. Unfortunately he has got quite a number of obstacles to climb over before getting the freedom of India. This movie was just fantastic. The cinematography just made me go 'WOW'. I can see why it won a lot of academy awards. I recommend this film to everyone living or dead.10/10,10,16,24,30 August 2001
Gandhi," A wonderful piece of film making
","Gandhi is one of the best movies I ever saw. The film is about Mahatma Gandhi (Ben Kingsley) and his struggle to free India from British rule. Gandhi is and will always be a classic. This movie should be watched by all no matter what. This film has something it has acting, a great plot, and realism. I recommend this film to all without hesitation.10/10",10,11,18,1 September 2001
Pearl Harbor," Good movie with action sequences but bad romance
","Pearl Harbor I thought was a good movie. The movie follows the lives of two best friends, Danny, played by Josh Hartnett (Virgin Suicides) and Rafe, played by Ben Affleck (Good Will Hunting). Coincidentally they both fall in love with the same girl, played by Kate Beckinsale. It soon turns out to be an almost soap-opera like love triangle which to me is too ridiculous. Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy) gives one of the most realistic portrayals and best performance as President Roosevelt. Also Alec Baldwin (The Shadow) gave a good performance as the head aviation commander. The movie also stars many other famous stars such as Cuba Gooding Jr., Dan Aykroyd, and Tom Seizmore. Pearl Harbor probably had to be one of the best movies on Pearl Harbor because of the realistic dogfights, the special effects, and the acting, especially Jon Voight's. Unfortunately the romance segments of the movie are stupid and pointless. If I were the director, I would try to keep the romance parts of the movie to a bare minimum. There are also, many fast camera movements during the attack on Pearl Harbor, which I liked. I am also surprised it got a PG-13 rating. The bombing of Pearl Harbor was pretty violent and bloody. Overall, I recommend this movie to everyone, but just skip the romance part of the movie. Other than that, you will like it.7/10 stars",7,0,0,4 June 2001
Resident Evil," Better than expected but had major flaws
","Resident Evil is at least not like Tomb Raider when it comes to video games made into movies: bad. While Resident Evil is scary, violent, and has some great action sequences, I really did wish it stuck more to the first video game, or at least not have put in the 'Red Queen'. The movies does have its little twists that will surprise you. One more flaw is that sometimes the actors are actually trying to ACT. Those scenes are almost like watching Battlefield Earth. Overall, I thought the movie is good and will most likely buy it on DVD. The only people who may not like it are the Resident Evil fanatics. I may be wrong, but that's how I see it.8/10",8,0,0,16 March 2002
Dog Day Afternoon," Al Pacino in one of his best performances in one of the best films I have ever seen
","I have to give 100% 10/10 acting for Al Pacino because he had be believing that he was actually playing Sonny. Why he did not win the Oscar for this role will always baffle me. This movie is a gem to see. It has great, GREAT acting, great plot, and parts that will keep you nailed to your seat. If you want to see a great crime film, rent or buy this.10/10",10,4,5,1 May 2002
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," George Clooney and David Strathairn give career-defining performances in this Edward R. Murrow biopic
","The truth is a complex concept. What is the truth? When do people deserve to hear the truth? But most important, whose job is it to tell the truth? The film Good Night, And Good Luck, directed by George Clooney, not only expertly deals with truth in journalism, but also the ethics all journalists should follow and owe to the public. It is also the best movie of the year thus far.The 1950s brought many changes. Television was beginning to come into everyone's homes, motion pictures were starting to be filmed in the widescreen cinemascope process and the American people's fears of communism had reached its peak. The most respected newsman at the time, Edward R. Murrow, and his producer Fred Friendly, want to go after Senator Joseph McCarthy for his unsubstantiated charges against supposed Communists in the U.S. While Murrow wants to do hard-hitting news, CBS' sponsors want nothing to do with it. Murrow must also be prepared to face McCarthy himself and risk having his career ruined by being labeled as a Communist sympathizer.The acting by this ensemble cast is truly magnificent. Each actor performs their part with every right note and never falters. David Strathairn should get an Oscar nomination for his career-defining performance as Murrow. He plays the role with the integrity and honesty that made Murrow loved and trusted by so many Americans. George Clooney also gives the best performance of his career with his role as producer Fred Friendly. Unlike most of his past roles, which have been one-dimensional, here he gets to show us his real dramatic side, throwing away his pretty-boy charm in favor of a tough and serious part.Jeff Daniels, who is the most overlooked actor in Hollywood, plays CBS president Sig Mickelson and shows us, once again, why he can perform in just about any genre and any role with ease. He presents a human character who knows that he has responsibilities to sponsors and the business side of entertainment and he would probably be the evil corporate bad guy in a more typical Hollywood film.The film also sports excellent performances from Patricia Clarkson and Robert Downey Jr. as a married couple who work behind the scenes on Murrow's program.This is George Clooney's second stint as a director. His first was the mediocre but visually enthralling Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind. Along with cinematographer Robert Elswit, the decision to shoot this piece in black-and-white helps the dark atmosphere of the film, but also gives it a period feel and authenticity. Clooney's decision to have most of the characters smoking also helped give the film more of a '50s feel. Seeing the cigarette smoke float into the lights puts the audience right in the middle of this time period. Clooney, above all things, should be praised for not opting to use an actor as Senator Joseph McCarthy and instead uses archival footage.The Senator himself was a great 'actor' who managed to convince the public that Communists could take over the United States. With this film, Clooney doesn't water down any details or make it an audience friendly film. There are no clear good guys or bad guys. Clooney and co-writer Grant Heslov create real people, great dialogue and a fantastic film of historical importance.The music, with jazz vocals sung by Dianne Reeves are beautifully edited into the film at the right times. There is no background score, but instead music is heard on the radio and through the airwaves. The editing itself is very well done. There are no quick cutaways. Editor Stephen Mirrione doesn't go off on tangents and the action isn't coming out at lightning fast speed.Overall, this is the best and most important film of the year. Clooney has proved that somewhere in him is true talent as an actor and director. The cast gives magnificent performances, the stark black and white cinematography is beautiful, and the importance of this film, especially with the type of news outlets that are prevalent today, is too important to be ignored. Come Oscar time, this better win some acting awards, as well as Best Picture.Final Grade: A+",10,2,4,20 December 2005
Mulholland Drive," A great 'thinking' movie
","I thought Mulholland Dr. was one pretty good film because it makes you think. I just saw the movie and when I came out, I had so many answers to what some parts of the movie were supposed to mean. Mulholland Dr. will make you think and it should. While the films genre is a drama-mystery, there also some parts that will scare because it will make you wonder what will happen next. One scene sent a tingle down my spine just because I was wondering what would happen next. I overall, recommend this movie to an older audience, 16 and older because younger kids might find the film boring.10/10",10,1,1,8 December 2001
The Evil Dead," The best movie of the Evil dead series
","This one has got to be the best. It has good plot, the acting is great, and there is a whole lot of gore. I think the best part was the ending. If you like a zombie movie that has a lot of gore, rent or buy this one in the collectors edition.",10,1,2,8 November 1999
Saw II," Saw II: Another Mediocre Sequel
","Sequels, especially to horror films, seem to pop up every year. Many are unnecessary, like the Halloween and Texas Chainsaw Massacre sequels. It is hard to judge these films on their own merits, especially while comparing them to the film they follow. Saw II is a very uneven film with many highlights, but also many downfalls.For those who are not familiar with the plot of Saw, it is about a serial killer who puts his victims in life and death situations. For example, a character will wake up chained to a pipe and be forced to kill the person who is also chained across from him if he wants to live. If he does not commit the act within a certain timeframe, both of them will die.In this sequel, Detective Eric Mason (Donnie Wahlberg) finds out his delinquent son is one of the few unlucky people forced to use their intellect and cooperation in a booby-trapped house. The catch is that all the victims have inhaled a nerve gas that will kill them within a few hours if they don't escape. Mason has to cooperate and play Jigsaw's 'game' if he ever wants to see his son again.The movie works well within the conventions of the horror genre. It has the violence and murders that the audience expects from horror films. The unique deathtraps in this movie will, doubtlessly satisfy gore-hungry fans.The acting is also quite impressive for a horror film. All the actors seem to understand the parts they play and play them with great realism and human emotion. Wahlberg is believable as a detective who can't balance his work and troubled life. He depicts the pain of a father whose life seems to be at its worst. Tobin Bell is very creepy as Jigsaw. From his cold stares to his devious smile, this man, who considers himself a prophet, is quite obviously a psychopath and finds pleasure in seeing others fight for their lives.The actor who is the most impressive out of the ensemble of victims in Jigsaw's game is Franky G, who plays a Puerto Rican drug dealer. The fact that the actor, who has a very macho physique and demeanor, plays him with such depravity and cowardliness lends a realistic desperation to the character: the scene where this is most evident is when he has to find a key in a pit that is filled with syringes in less than two minutes. Instead of going in himself, he throws a woman, who is a part of this group of victims, in without any thought.The attempt of the director, Darren Bousman, and cinematographer, David Armstrong, at giving the film a low-budget look and feel should be applauded. While it is quite obvious that this movie had quite a hefty budget behind it (unlike the first film) the attempt comes with clear artistic intentions.Unfortunately, not everything about this movie is milk and cookies. Quite a few aspects of the script are very poorly written. A few times, the technique of scaring through a 'jump out of the closet' is used, which is quite annoying and gains absolutely nothing in terms of scares.Another terrible aspect of this film is the scriptwriters' decision to reveal the killer, Jigsaw, so early in the movie and spoon feed the audience his motives.What made him such a great character in the first film was the fact that the audience barely knew anything about him. In this movie, his motives are explained so clearly that it completely ruins what Jigsaw was all about. Imagine if Alfred Hitchcock had revealed Mrs. Bates in Psycho. Would the movie be worth watching? This unfortunate little detail takes away so much from the movie. It doesn't ruin it, but it is a detraction. He becomes a caricature instead of a character.What's worse is the 'twist' (if one could call it that) at the end of the movie. It just does not fit Jigsaw's profile. Without giving too much away, the end is completely unrealistic and dumb and contradicts the first movie.It's hard to decide who should see Saw II. While the film is clearly for fans of the horror genre, it should be noted that this movie does not even come close to the psychological terror the original achieved so well.This movie is, without question, for people who enjoy seeing lots of blood and violence and are perhaps even turned on by it.For those who really loved the first one, it's hardly worth shelling out hard-earned cash to see the sequel. Perhaps these fans should instead wait for next Halloween and rent it.Final Grade: C",5,0,1,20 December 2005
Black Hawk Down," Could have been better
","While Black Hawk Down is reciving amazing praise from critics, I did think it could've been better. I thought the movie was exciting. It also it is good at showing the true horrors of war. What I didn't like about it is because it went fast. One scene would focus on one of the groups for 5 minutes then it would go to the next group of soldiers. This makes me from giving a 10. Most likely this movie will get nominated for some Oscars.8/10",8,0,0,2 February 2002
Pride & Prejudice," Best film of the year 2005
","The period piece has never been a favorite film genre for reviewers. There have been excellent ones, such as Barry Lyndon and awful ones, such as Sense And Sensibility. Perhaps the worst quality is the tendency for these types of films to just stop and ponder. Pride & Prejudice is thankfully not that type, but will instead enter the pantheon of great period films.The film takes place in 1797. Mrs. Bennet (Brenda Blethyn) is trying to get her five daughters married off. In hopes of doing so, she brings them all to a dance where the dashing Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen) will be attending. One of the daughters, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), falls in love with Darcy, but can't stand his arrogant personality. She tries to wow him, but is unsuccessful in many attempts. Through this tale, all the characters come to know what true love is in their own way.The acting is absolutely fantastic. Keira Knightley has never been as impressive as she is in this role. She projects a virgin innocence to her character. Knightley brings complexity to what could've been a clichéd, one-note female character. Matthew MacFadyen as Darcy is awesome in his role as an emotionless, unlikable man. For a film in this day and age, it was a pleasure to see such an arrogant, pompous character portrayed realistically. The scene that best stands out is at a dance party where Elizabeth offers to dance with Darcy. He turns her down, saying 'I don't dance if I can help it.' Just the sheer tone and mannerisms of his character make him unlikable in a performance that deserves an Oscar nomination.Brenda Blethyn, one of the greatest British actresses to grace the stage and screen, gives a magnificent and hilarious performance as Mrs. Bennet. She has such a natural ability, it doesn't seem like she is acting. There are so many layers to her character and she gives equal emotion to all her personalities and feelings. It is also great to see Donald Sutherland back on the screen, as the caring and loving father Mr. Bennet. He gives a sweet and lovable performance.The actor who gives the best performance in this film is the great Judi Dench as Darcy's callous aunt. Though she doesn't have a big role, she has a fierce and imposing manner on screen that makes her impossible to ignore. She chews up the scenery every time she appears on screen. Her cold, emotionless stares send shivers down the audience's spine.The writing for this movie, especially for a period piece, is quite fantastic. While it cannot be judged as an adaptation, the dialogue is not boring or overly fancy with hefty amounts of old-English colloquialisms. It has some, but overall, the dialogue is written in such a way that will satisfy audiences without confusing them. The comedic dialogue is well balanced against the dramatic side of the movie without one over powering the other. Therefore, the audience knows they are seeing a dramatic comedy, not a comedy trying to be a drama or vice-versa.Director Joe Wright smartly keeps the film moving at a fast pace, which happens very rarely in period pieces. In most, the directors just stop and let characters talk for what seems like forever. Instead, Wright constructs every scene with integral importance to the story.He treats all the characters, especially the males, with respect. The film could've turned out to be a one-sided woman's picture, but thankfully doesn't turn out that way.Wright makes the film stand out from the others in the genre. His use of the zoom and hand-held camera is quite unheard of in period pieces, but he uses them sparingly and at the right moments. His use of the zoom on a character's face during a highly emotional moment is executed very well and helps heighten the emotional effect. Overall, taking on a novel that has been adapted countless times is a daunting task, and his version is very well done.A period piece can't be reviewed if the visuals are ignored. The cinematography by Roman Osin is like a beautiful painting. The lighting and colors are so vibrant and stunning, making one wish they could live in such a time period. His color schemes capture the English countryside at its best, particularly in a scene where Elizabeth is just strolling across a hill. The costumes and sets are all gorgeous as well and also enhance the love for this film. In many period pieces, these factors tend to be the main distracters in the film, thus leading to the term 'costume drama.' Going into a film with negative expectations and coming out with the exact opposite is a great feeling. Those who go into Pride & Prejudice do not have to be fans of period pieces. It is recommended that everyone goes see this film. The mature romantic nature of this story will even make the most stoic person want to bawl. Come Oscar time, this film better rack up several nominations.Final Grade: A+",10,13,19,20 December 2005
The Mummy Returns," A great chezey ball of a film
","The Mummy Returns is really not what I expected. The movie focuses around Brendan Fraiser who is married to Rachel Weisz. They have a son. Then suddenly Im-Ho-Tep played by Arnold Vosloo comes back to get revenge on them but also wants to get the Scorpian King's (The Rock) army under his control to take over the world. This movie has too too too much more action than the first and there is one thing I didn't like: WARNING MINOR SPOILERThe Scorpian King turns into an actual giant scorpian near the end and fights like that. I recommend this movie to big action fans, but to everyone else stick with the first one.7/10",7,0,0,20 May 2001

Reservoir Dogs," A funny and at times a serious crime gone wrong film
","Reservoir Dogs is a totally different and original film (but not as original as Memento). The cast I thought was great especially Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi and Harvey Kietel. At times this movie really made me crack up like the Anne Francis joke. Other times it will make you scared at what some of these things these people do. Overall it is a great film and the way they made those gun shots look real was great.10/10",10,1,3,8 May 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," If you didn't read the book, you will still like it
","I didn't even read the book(s) and I still really liked this movie. The movie is about a young wizard named Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe). He is then enrolled in a school called Hogwarts, if I remember. He then befriends two other fellow students, Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson). Then Harry learns about this magical stone called the Sorcerer's Stone and the three of them go out to search for it. I thought the movie was quite good. The special effects were pretty good. Acting well, it was good but was not bad. The only real problem I had with the movie was understanding the character names and remembering their names and who they were. Other than that it is a great film. I no doubt recommend this movie to all.9/10",5,0,0,2 December 2001
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Goblet is good, but just too long to sustain its Fire
","The time is upon us. No, not the holiday season.. It's the fourth film in the highly anticipated Harry Potter series. For those who are interested, the first was simple children's fare, the second was better, and the third was the best. The fourth is quite enjoyable in many respects, but feels too long to be thoroughly entertaining.Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is in his fourth year at Hogwarts. It is also time for the TriWizard Tournament, in which a select trio of young wizards and witches perform deadly feats to be the winner for their magic school. Even though Harry Potter is too young to enter the tournament, his name somehow ends up in the Goblet of Fire, and he is chosen to be a competitor. There is more to this mystery, and he will soon learn that a lot is at stake.The Harry Potter films are definitely different from most run of the mill fantasies. For one thing, in most fantasy films, the acting is atrocious. With the Harry Potter series, the acting, especially by the three main protagonists, gets better and better. It seems as they get older, the three actors greatly exhibit their teenage angst with the characters. The returning cast is great of course. Michael Gambon (Dumbledore), Maggie Smith (Minerva McGonagall), Alan Rickman (Severus Snape), Gary Oldman (Sirius Black) and Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy), all play their roles with entertaining fervor. Even though they all played much better parts in the past, they seem to be enjoying their roles, and overall are great to watch. Brendan Gleeson is the most impressive, as Professor 'Mad Eye' Moody, who specializes in teaching the dark arts. His performance is so full of energy and passion that it is just absolute fun watching him perform as this nutty character. Ralph Fiennes, despite his short role as Lord Voldemort, is quite terrifying. His voice eerily fits this villainous character. He's bound to scare the children.This film is a great example of visual cinema at its best. The beautiful Gothic sets evoke a dark, mystical feeling that helps add to this fairy tale story. The cinematography by Roger Pratt captures a very ominous and creepy settings gives the viewer the feeling that they are a part of this world of mystery and magic. The special effects are also well done. They seem are when necessary and come off well.Unfortunately, this movie's strong parts are hampered by an editing job that seems to have gone unnoticed. The movie feels too long. Had it been cut down by a mere twenty to thirty minutes, it may have turned out a lot better. Some scenes just go on for longer than they should. There is no need for Harry Potter's dream to be repeated as much as it is. There are also scenes that seemed unnecessary to the story.One example is when McGonagall is teaching the boys of Hogwarts how to dance. She chooses Ron as her partner, much to his embarrassment. This is an unnecessary scene that could've been put on the cutting room floor to help keep the story moving along. Another such scene is when Professor Moody turns Draco Malfoy into a ferret after he attempts to perform a spell on Harry Potter while Harry's back is turned. It is a funny scene, but in the end, does it further the story at all? Barely. The most it shows is how powerful Professor Moody is, but we all already know that by the middle of the movie. The film is two hours and thirty minutes long, yet feels like four hours and fifty minutes.This movie is very enjoyable, despite its shortcomings. It's got action and thrills that will please parents as well as children. While the story is not as intriguing as the third, it's still enjoyable.Final Grade: B",7,0,0,20 December 2005
A Beautiful Mind," A Beautiful Mind= A beautiful film
","A Beautiful Mind no doubt had to be one of the best films of 2001, but I unfortuantely did not see it that year. Russel Crowe is great (as usual) as the schizophrenic, but highly intelligent John Nash. He is just so good in this film. Russel Crowe certainly gives one of his best performance I have ever seen.10/10",10,0,2,20 January 2002
Army of Darkness," An absolute classic
",This is one movie where the viewer gets what they want. There is not one aspect of this movie that I don't like. When I first saw this movie I was hoping it would be good. Boy I wasn't wrong. Sam Raimi's directing along with the realistic makeup and special effects make this one a classic.,10,1,1,6 January 2001
Amélie," No doubt one of the best films of 2001
","Amelie is basically a fun, happy, and laughable comedy. The movie is basically about a young woman named Amelie (Audrey Tautou) who after helping one person, decides to help others and at the same time, try to find love. The movie has basically an easy plot. Overall the movie is great. It is funny. They don't overload on jokes. They have just the right amount. This movie will make you smile through the whole time. It did to me. I recommend this movie really to people 12 and older because anyone younger may find it boring and the jokes not funny.10/10",10,1,4,7 December 2001
Gladiator," Great movie
","This movie was just one of the best. This a Stanley Kubrick like film (well from my point of view). It has great acting, superb special effects, and plot that is just excellent. I would recommend this movie to everyone.",10,0,0,18 August 2000
Evil Dead II," Another great horror comedy film
","I do not know where to start with this movie. I mean there is Bruce Campbell as Ash, deadites, great makeup and special effects and a great plot. There is also great chainsaw action sequences and music. This movie goes into my gold movie box. 10/10",10,1,2,6 January 2001
The Island," Michael Bay's First Great Movie
","I have never been a fan of Michael Bay for numerous reasons. The main one being he made intelligent insulting action movies. Yes, they are good action movies, but far from good movies. Also the terrible acting, writing, and vomit inducing editing didn't help as well. But, after seeing The Island, I am now convinced Michael Bay does have the ability to make a good movie. The movie takes place in the future. Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) and Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson) are citizens of an underground Utopian society, people who survived an Earth destroying apocalypse. Everyone wears white, goes through the same daily routines everyday, eat the same foods, work at the same places, and don't ask questions. The one thing that everyone wants though in this society is to go to the Island, which could be compared to Heaven in many ways. The only way you get there is through a lottery system where a winner is picked (a parable to how soldiers were to be drafted and sent off to Vietnam in a similar lottery system.) Lincoln starts to develop an inquisitive mind about the world he lives in, the Island, and what lies beyond the world he lives in. When Jordan is picked to go to the Island, Lincoln discovers the real truth about the Island, and escapes his city with Jordan into the above unknown world to discover the truth behind the meaning of their existence, while trying to be stopped by a expert mercenary (Djimon Hounsou). What makes this movie better than all of other Michael Bay's movies, you may ask? EVERYTHING. The characters are strong from the start. We are drawn into their naive world and minds because we take an interest in finding out the true meaning behind everything. As the characters take steps to discover this, we are with them throughout the film. Michael Bay infuses the audience with questions about what is going. He explains little, but enough to not be too complex or too dumbed-down. He lets the characters slowly discover the mysteries that the audience is eagerly trying to solve themselves He keeps the plot moving at a brisk pace. He spends time with the characters in the plot so we know and understand why they do the things they do. There are many messages that this movie has to say and I'm quite glad they aren't hammered into us. Ewan McGregor is one of the best actors working now. He can even make a mediocre film have some credibility (ala Trainspotting). The actors love their characters, especially Ewan, whom I get the feeling, from his charisma and screen presences, was having a ball of a time working on this movie. He is an actor who always knows how to play just right. Scarlett Johansson is truly one of the best young actresses working. She isn't there just for eye candy (though she is darn good looking) or a 'damsel in distress', but is integral to the plot as much as Ewan's character is. The other actors such as Sean Bean, Steve Buscemi and Djimon Hounsou are just great as well.I can't talk about a Michael Bay movie with mentioning the action scenes. They are done superbly; they are well edited, greatly choreographed, and are rousing, thrilling spectacles. I have no quibbles with them. There is some controversy that Michael Bay put too many in. I think the action's work very well with the film and they fit very well into the film. Of course, I have some minor quibbles with this movie. The main one being the blatant, overuse of product placements in this movie. As far as product placements, they should be saved for commercials, not movies. Overall, The Island is a redemption for Michael Bay. Without the tight leash of Jerry Bruckheimer producing the film, Michael Bay has made a symbolic and movie that will bring many questions about monetary and moral ethics. It is not to be missed.",9,0,1,15 August 2005
