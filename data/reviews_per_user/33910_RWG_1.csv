The Blair Witch Project," what's the deal?
","I don't know how this movie got into the top 250 because out of the 100 or so posts I've read here so far, about 70-80 are negative.  Anyway, this is way overrated. You call a pile of rocks scary? Some stick designs on a tree scary? We never even see the Blair Witch. What we see is an hour and half or so of three bickering college students walking through the woods. I know, I'm just some ignorant teen who doesn't realize that the unseen is scarier than high-tech special effects creatures. Whatever.  Rent Friday the 13th or Halloween and order a pizza, better than spending seven bucks on a ticket another seven on a watered down coke and day-old popcorn.",2,0,2,15 August 1999
