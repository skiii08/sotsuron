The Avengers," Definitely One of the Best Marvel Movies
","It is amazing various directors or filmmakers in general were collaborating to bring together a cinematic universe that would eventually lead to this movie. Never have we seen a good live- action movie with this many superheroes. The only superhero movie better than this one before its release was definitely The Dark Knight, but this is a film that is much more fun and exciting.In the very first few scenes with Black Widow, we understand the film will have a very comedic tone to it while staying true to the action/adventure formula. I've only seen this film a few times, but every time I do I find myself smiling a lot, especially in scenes with my favorite avenger - Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr. pulls the role off perfectly for every film involving Iron Man - even in the not-so- good Iron Man 3. If all this great comedy wasn't in the movie it would be a fest of eye-candy at the end and that's about it, which is not what I look for in a movie.In the scene where all of the avengers are arguing with Fury, I feel like Stark and Banner could have accessed the information earlier and asked about it, and in that way they could have avoided the feud all together, but I guess this movie needed tension of some sort. It is also a little unclear if Loki manipulated their thoughts since his intention was supposedly to have the avengers tear each other apart from the inside.If people are going to complain about this movie being cliché, guess what - it's based on comic books. These types of films are meant to be fun and exciting, even if that means reusing formulas for action films. If the movie serves its purpose, it is a good film, and The Avengers' purpose was to entertain.",9,2,5,9 May 2015
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," More Dialogue
","The bloodshed continues in this conclusion to a great two-part film experience. It continues, but there is less of it as none of these villains rely on heavy arsenals of 'bodyguards' as in the case of Cottonmouth in vol. 1.The main thing this film accomplishes is that it fleshes out the main characters - The Bride and Bill - so much more than in the first installment. We actually get to see Bill's face throughout the film, witness the two having real conversations to develop their relationship, and we even witness some complex emotions from the Bride. Where the first Kill Bill was fun, vol. 2 is more about the characters.This is not to say that vol. 2 is not a fun film. It is extremely fun - my friend audibly expressed satisfaction at certain moments throughout the film as it was his first time watching volumes 1 and 2 over the past two days. It is also notably very tense towards the conclusion of the film, and in this film Tarantino once again proves to be the master of the monologue with a great segment in which the mythology of a super hero is discussed. It certainly doesn't match up to the intro to Inglourious Basterds or Calvin Candie's monologue in Django Unchained, but its placement in the film is nearly perfect.One disappointing factor of this movie is that, in my opinion, it seems to have a cop out instead of a well fleshed conclusion. I can't say much past this without a major spoiler, so I'll say you simply have to watch the movie to see what I am referring to. In a movie that incorporates the martial arts the conclusion may satisfy some, but I think it is a tad ridiculous compared to the rest of the two films put together.While this film may impress me just a little less than the first, I am still eager to see The Whole Bloody Affair at a theater in my lifetime if I get the opportunity.3.0/4.0",8,1,2,5 December 2015
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A Good Combo of Fiction and Documentary
","Borat is over the top, highly offensive at times, making it uncomfortable to watch for certain scenes. Some of these scenes are uncomfortable in a good way though as they point out how bigoted certain Americans can be. Though the intent for this movie was to be a comedic road film, it accidentally turned out to be a well- structured commentary on America as a side note for this extremely raunchy film.One fact I dislike about the making of this film is that the filmmakers didn't have the 'real' people they interacted with sign release forms, which instigated a lawsuit by the frat brothers in the film as they did not want their families to see them act the way they did on their part of the road trip depicted in this film. While the lack of release forms brought out honesty and bluntness from the real people shown in the film, it was very inconsiderate of the filmmakers.What is quite brilliant is the 'bad' aspects of America depicted in this film. When Borat visits a rodeo to sing his national anthem, we get racist comments from people who are involved in the rodeo, we see the crowd strongly agree with Borat about 'killing all the terrorists,' showing the ugly side of being a radical in the U.S. Funny and uncomfortable moments also depict real people making offensive comments about Jewish people, homosexuals, and other minorities.Aside from the sub-theme of a commentary on America, this film is very funny, although a lot of the comedy deals with Borat's own bigotry, which is not so bad when you think about it since it is Sacha Baron Cohen, an American, playing the role of a character - part of the fiction in this film. This can be seen as a commentary of bigotry in general as well, though Borat's bigotry mainly deals with the Jewish community. Seeing Borat trying to adjust to and learn from American customs time and time again evokes big laughs from the audience since he is clueless about manners and respect for certain people. One of the best moments of the film is when Borat's driving instructor informs him that women can choose who to have sex with in America and Borat goes wide-eyed as exclaims 'WHAT?!?'If you are easily offended this is not a film for you, but this is a surprisingly very good comedy and a good commentary on America.3.0/4.0",8,0,0,4 September 2015
Mission: Impossible III," Hunt is Much More Emotionally Invested
","The opening sequence for this film is my favorite of the series. It throws you into the story out of chronology like some of my favorite films (Pulp Fiction, Inception, The Prestige) and it is very tense even though we don't know the exact context of the situation. It sets a standard for the rest of the movie to live up to, and it does so at least as far as the character of Ethan Hunt is concerned.After this tense opening, we get a feel for Ethan's personal life as he has left IMF for the time being to live with his fiancée. He clearly has retained some skills as he can lip read a conversation which concerns him between some females at what I assume to be a wedding shower. This isn't really an effective way to show he misses his work, but what do you know, during this shower he receives a call and meets up with his superior in a convenience store. His mission calls for him to rescue a female spy whom he mentored, and when he fails he sets his priorities straight - Hunt spontaneously marries his fiancée and wishes to protect her.Once we get into the main plot of the film, there is a focus around the Philip Seymour Hoffman villain, and Hunt and his crew kidnap him in a sequence which illustrates how the mask-making works - exciting! What's awesome yet a little strange about this villain is he takes this threat to him extremely personally. Instead of talking at all about the Macguffin referred to as the Rabbit's Foot, Hoffman's character calmly asks Hunt if he has a wife or girlfriend and threatens to kill him in front of her if he ever gets the chance. This pushes Hunt to a near breaking point, but we never get a clear explanation why this is so personal to the Hoffman character. Either way, it ups the stakes for Hunt as the villain is eventually able to track down Hunt's wife and uses her as a hostage to get Hunt to obtain the Rabbit's Foot for him.It is clear in this film that the Macguffin is the Macguffin - a plot device which drives the movie but has little importance - as we focus more on whether Hunt will be able to save his wife/himself in the end or not. This makes Mission: Impossible III a better movie than its predecessors as we are more invested in the characters as Hunt is more emotionally invested in the mission this time around.As an action movie, however, this film is just a little bit of a letdown - there are about 3 elaborate action sequences spread throughout the movie that are brief and only somewhat exciting. The climactic sequence of the movie is a good showdown between Hunt and the villain, but is not as climactic as it could be, taking place in a village of small buildings without the opportunity for cool tactics to be used, but as I said, this movie is more about Hunt's struggle to protect his wife, making up for this lack of great action which this series is all about.3.0/4.0",8,1,1,9 August 2015
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Delightful Tale, Made me Uncomfortable Towards the End
","This is the last film I had to watch for a class on young adult literature adaptation this summer. It might be safe to say this was my favorite film out of the three works we had to study this summer, the other two being 'The Fault in Our Stars' and 'My Sister's Keeper.'I know I shouldn't really compare a film adaptation to its predecessor very often, but I am going to for a few aspects. While the letter-writing idea seemed to work for the novel, to be honest we probably could have gotten the same idea if Charlie simply narrated this film. The letter-writing in this film does not make too much sense since a film is a visual representation, so we see the experiences. Plus, how does writing a letter to the audience work in a film in general?I liked how there was more interaction between Charlie and his teacher (played by Paul Rudd) in the film than in the novel. We get to see why the teacher becomes friends with Charlie when everyone in Charlie's class looks at him as an outcast - by the way, people in real life aren't as bullied as Charlie is in this film, even if they are 'nerdy' or whatever stereotypes bullies tend to go after.The film doesn't really address this, but the story takes place in 1991 and 1992, which explains the lack of technology in the film that I bet people didn't even notice. The story is relevant to this time period (being released in 2012) while touching on a completely different decade - and the beginning of that decade for that matter.As for technical aspects of the film, I thought the acting was pretty mediocre for the most part. The camera-work was pretty standard as far as cinematography goes in this day and age, and the same goes for the editing. I think the strongest part of the film is Charlie's internal thoughts and the brief flashbacks we get to read into his life with more insight. A more dramatic coming-of-age tale, and a decent film. Though the cast isn't loaded with talent, more of the cast should have been recognized. I feel like the big selling point of this movie is that Emma Watson is the female lead.",8,0,1,12 July 2015
In Bruges," A Near Masterpiece
","When I first viewed this film I had remembered the cover of the DVD which my brother owned, and I thought it would be a simple B-grade action film. I am so glad I was wrong because In Bruges is a true gem which delves into the motifs of guilt and hell/purgatory.With the two main characters we have opposite sides of the personality - this has been said by McDonagh himself. There was a side of him which loved to sight-see (Ken) and the side that just wanted to have fun (Ray). From this we get a very cultured hit man as well as a moody young man itching to get the most out of life (drinking, meeting women, exploring).While I love Ray for his internal struggles, he is somewhat of a hard man to like; he is brutally honest, asks people whether they would kill themselves because of certain traits, and he calls people gay or retarded. But something has happened before the start of the story that makes him question his morality in the middle of the film and whether or not he should be punished for it.This film seems somewhat influenced by Tarantino - at least for the dialogue aspect. It is not plot-based; it touches on pop culture references and includes lingo that make the characters seem more realistic or interesting than just characters. However, the problem is that it seems to try too hard at this.However, there are a good amount of funny conversations or situations in which the characters find themselves. Think Tarantino's dialogue meets an even darker humor, like the humor of the Coen brothers.One plausibility factor I cannot stand, however, is that one character simply refuses to die. To avoid spoilers, I will just say he/she lives way longer than they should have, but this needs to happen to help the plot very late in the film.The thing I love so much about this film is the ending monologue given by Ray (Colin Farrell's character), and the ambiguity behind what has happened to the character and whether this story should be considered a dark fantasy or a horrible reality. It is very enjoyable, and the themes are amazing, but this film falls just short of perfect.Added 5/18/15: Who am I kidding, I LOVE this movie and highly recommend it! 10/10",10,1,5,24 February 2015
To Be or Not to Be," A Hilarious Comedy that is Overlooked
","It is surprising how funny To Be or Not to Be actually is. It does not make a mockery of ALL Nazis seeing that the main villain is smart and cunning, but it does make buffoons out of the high command or enlisted Germans who follow orders blindly without questioning the logic behind the orders. The Germans who are fooled are fooled by nothing other than an acting troupe with Jack Benny at the helm, showing the Germans as buffoons who take in information at face value.As the movie begins, the audience laughs at the ridiculousness of the acting troupe performing as the high command under Hitler's third Reich. This comedy is interrupted by a soldier becoming infatuated with Tura's (Jack Benny) wife to the point where he thinks they will have a future together. This relationship finishes setting up the first act, and the audience regains the gift of comic relief when it is the acting troupe who must save Tura's wife and bring down Hitler's high command as their identity is nearly compromised.The humor in the film has a wide range. At times it consists of Jack Benny complaining, but mostly the humor deals with the dramatic irony that the German command is unaware of the acting troupe's true identity. The troupe moves along with its plans with great ease as most Germans take them as fellow Germans and do not see past the costumes. Making the Germans puzzled is almost as wacky as watching a Marx Brothers movie, but it is not exactly the same type of humor since the Marx Brothers deal with rapid-fire jokes and physical comedy such as matching action to make characters believe they are looking into a mirror. In the case of To Be or Not to Be, the actors lead the Germans to believe they are dealing with officials, creating a similar illusion to the 'mirror' antics of the Marx Brothers.An interesting notion of this film is that it was made at the time of the war, but does not induce fear of the enemy (Nazis) at any time during the film. Showing that the enemy can be imitated, and that, in fact, Hitler is 'just a man with a little moustache,' it illustrates how little people had to worry about the enemy at that point in time by portraying the enemy as buffoons, not unlike Chaplin's The Great Dictator.To Be or Not to Be is a great, overlooked World War II comedy, and while it may not be up to part with The Great Dictator, it deserves more attention.3.5/4.0",9,1,2,17 March 2016
The Big Lebowski," The First of Many
","I will start reviewing every movie I see from now on - new to me or ones I choose to re-watch - with careful attention, and this is the first movie I will officially review. I chose this one since I have seen it most recently and it is a pretty simple film with a seemingly complex plot. This is one of the Coen Brothers' best films - not necessarily in the sense of great cinema, but rather in relation to the factor of entertaining the audience. I showed this film to my good friend Spencer just a few months ago and he wanted to watch it again tonight. It is easy to see why since I was quoting/enjoying a lot of the film for its great comedy, such as the many times Walter says 'shut the f--- up, Donnie,' how the Dude repeats things he hears from other people in order to get his point across, or how ridiculous the narrator's moustache is. I remember that on first viewing I did not appreciate this film since it is revealed by the Dude towards the conclusion that the MacGuffin of the film - the briefcase filled with a million dollars - was never really filled in the first place. Like Fargo, The Big Lebowski deals with the idea that most will go out of their habits or comfort zone in order to obtain an amount of money - however, it does so in a more ridiculous manner than Fargo. After a few re-watches I have found it important to appreciate this film's comedy rather than make sense of the almost non-existent plot in order to enjoy it. Does it matter that The Dude's journey turns into a dead end? No; his journey is still progressive as he goes from not giving a damn about anything to confronting people of the seemingly upper class about using him, and the journey has a great deal of laughs making this a great cinematic experience to enjoy and reflect on the importance of taking things easy in everyday life. 3.5/4.0",9,1,2,6 February 2015
Inglourious Basterds," Favorite Movie Which I Saw in the Theater the First Time
","I remember that this was my second Tarantino film. A few days before, I watched Reservoir Dogs with my brother, introducing me to Tarantino movies, and I was ecstatic that my Dad agreed to take me to Inglourious Basterds since the trailers made it look like a good revenge film. I was surprised that the film went beyond this notion and was simply fantastic overall, leaving me smiling as I left the theater.Let me just say, the early trailers for this film are deceiving. They make it appear that the premise is simply Brad Pitt and his men killing Nazis in a brutal manner throughout. This is definitely not the case, and actually touches on subjects I never would have imagined. Tarantino shows his knowledge for German cinema throughout as the main character of the B plot - Shoshanna - comes to own a cinema, and the Nazis are dealing with where they should hold the premiere for the new film by Joseph Goebbels - Nation's Pride.The villain, played by Christoph Waltz, is such an amazing character to watch. At certain points, he exhibits intellect and detective skills near Sherlock Holmes levels, and at other times he makes us laugh with how out of touch he is with certain customs. The first twenty minutes of the film is almost fully dedicated to this Hans Landa, and it proves to be among the best sequences Tarantino has ever written.I fully believe this film had a better screenplay than Django Unchained, but to me, it makes sense that the academy went with The Hurt Locker for best original screenplay. It makes sense not because The Hurt Locker fully deserved it, but because The Hurt Locker was a film that this country needed in 2009 to shape our perspective on the war being fought over seas.While Inglourious Basterds is not an accurate depiction of World War II or one of the most important World War II films, it is certainly one of the most fun to watch. It is tense, funny, crowd-pleasing, and at the same time it is a very smart movie with well-developed characters, an intricate plot, meta characteristics, and above all, extremely well-written. This now holds the spot of my 2nd favorite film by Quentin Tarantino, behind Pulp Fiction.4.0/4.0",10,1,4,11 December 2015
Shaun of the Dead," More Comedic than Horrifying, Watch for a Good Time
","Blending the genres of horror and comedy together is done well on occasion, but more often it is done poorly, especially when you look at the 'Scary Movie' franchise which parodies contemporary horror films by referencing them directly and making surface level jokes out of the situations. Luckily, with Shaun of the Dead, we get an intelligent comedy which is original in style and clever with its treatment of a zombie outbreak.We all know the concept of the zombie movie. A curse, or a sickness, or radioactivity etc. causes the dead to 'live again' to feed on the flesh and brains of living human beings. Most of the time they are slow walkers which is the case of Shaun of the Dead. Wright takes this concept and makes comparisons between the outbreak and normal life for Shaun. A motif shot used in the film focuses on Shaun slowly getting out of bed in the morning, walking in a zombie-like fashion towards the door while yawning in a way very similar to the noise zombies tend to make. The average working-class man is like a zombie in a swarm: lazy, conforming to and blending in with the rest of the swarm, and insignificant compared to the swarm as a whole.2 long takes that are done early in the film also compare society in a normal universe to one filled with zombies. Shaun is nonchalant in both of these sequences when he walks to a convenience store to buy a few items - he does not notice the difference, but in the first sequence he interacts with people a little more than in the second, but it seems that he really does not care about his surroundings too much, even though they change drastically in the second sequence when the zombie outbreak has already begun.While this is a zombie movie and is gruesome at some moments with guts and blood, the zombie violence seems more cartoonish than disturbing. The comedy in this movie outweighs the horror in this film in every fashion, including the violence.This film is solid on pacing and editing. While it seems to have an average pace at first, it really picks up once the zombies become a problem in the film. The editing is really interesting, making simple actions feel intense by using quick cuts between closeups which force us into the 'action.' Wright also has an interesting way of putting action scenes in sync exactly to the music in the background. In fact, a scene involving action to the rhythm of a song by Queen proves to be on of the best in the film.The story itself could be a little more interesting to be honest. We never get a thorough explanation of what causes the zombie outbreak, though this film does not feel like it needs one. The story revolving around Shaun and his friends and family is very straightforward - Shaun goes through a breakup early on, but tries to become a hero for his ex and for his family once he realizes the scale of the situation.Good comedy and a few unexpectedly well-done dramatic moments make this film enjoyable to watch.3.0/4.0",8,1,4,5 January 2016
The Babadook," I'm Not a Fan of the Horror Genre, This One is Worth It
","I've always found the horror genre uninteresting since many films within the genre seem so similar and because their sole purpose is give the audience a thrill rather than convey a good story (I guess you can make a similar argument for comedy). This being the first horror movie I have seen in a while, I have to say I am glad to see it. It's good, but still doesn't live up to the hype I heard from a few different people.The Babadook is scary in regard to suspense rather than by moments meant to startle, which I find predictable and boring. My heart would race as I saw part, but not all, of the titular Babadook, waiting and bracing myself to see what is 'underneath.' I highly prefer this type of thrill to the 'startling' horror movie. What makes it even better is it was able to do this with an independent budget - well done Jennifer Kent.My favorite sequence, and the sequence I was most frightened by, is when the book Mr. Babadook reappears and is put back together with new text, threatening the woman and her child. In fact, it was the most disturbing, yet simple, moment I have experienced in horror films in a long time.However, I don't give most horror movies a chance, and there are aspects within the Babadook that convey why I pass on watching horror movies. First, the kid is super annoying. The point of the character is for him to be annoying/a burden to his mother, but his acting is terrible. I don't care if he's a kid; actors are meant to convey distinct character, and this kid just whined no matter what emotion/mood he was meant to convey in the moment.Also, towards the conclusion, the mother finds out this creature is a spirit, and just happens to know that if she can get this spirit in the basement she can tame it like a pet. Where did this knowledge/success come from?I really liked the theme of trust in this movie - the kid struggles with whether he should trust his mother or not since she is clearly possessed by the Babadook from time to time. It is satisfying to see the woman and her son in a once again happy relationship, but this movie seems formulaic to the horror genre at times.",7,8,18,14 March 2015
Ted," Good Fun, but Just as Simple as Family Guy
","If you're looking to watch Ted by Seth MacFarlane, just don't expect it to be filled with 'smart' comedy. Notice it is the exact same type of humor you can find in Family Guy or in any of his other shows, except this time it is done in a live action fashion.The premise is that John Bennett is an outcast as a kid (which is hard to believe when he grows up to be Mark Wahlberg), and on Christmas he receives a teddy bear and wishes for it to come alive which it does the next morning. This isn't a moment just thrown into the beginning to set up how the profane, obnoxious, titular bear came to be - this sequence has some top notch MacFarlane humor to it to give us a sense of the comedic tone of the movie.The rest of the plot is pretty much to give the movie a plot around all the comedic bits - John struggles in a relationship with his girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) since Ted still lives with them while an obsessed fan of Ted's wants him for his son Robert. That's it.As I said, the tone is reminiscent of Family Guy in that some of the gags are clearly in the same layout as the cutaways in Family Guy. With Ted sounding very similar to Peter Griffin (but not exactly like him as MacFarlane explains in an interview), at points Ted becomes a meta-film, especially when Ted specifically states 'I do not sound THAT much like Peter Griffin.' In a sense, this movie is kind of like Pinocchio... except for grown-ups... and not as smart. Put this movie on if you are just looking for something simple, yet enjoyable.",8,1,1,5 July 2015
Creed," New Life to the Cinematic Universe
","Creed is the Rocky of this generation. It is sensational with great performances and amazing direction and cinematography. Seeing some of the original Rocky movies will give you good context for this film, though not the entire series is great.Creed, on the other hand, is a compelling continuation of the Balboa universe with new energy. A conflicted Adonis who would fight in his youth before realizing his father was the famous Apollo Creed seems a wreck when he becomes an adult, traveling to Mexico repeatedly in order to make extra money fighting every now and then. He becomes arrogant and angry when people from Apollo's gym will not train him and learns a lesson that being a great fighter comes more from nurture than nature.Even though Adonis is privileged to be living with his late father's wife, he makes the decision to abandon that life which lacks excitement to find Rocky Balboa in Philadelphia. He figures he can receive training from Rocky since he was Apollo's friend, and with a little effort he's right.What's great about this film is the conflicted Adonis played the up and coming Michael B Jordan, from great stuff like The Wire and Fruitvale Station. He plays the son of Creed, but he is more than that. This very notion is what makes him such a conflicted character - throughout the film he is struggling over his need to become his father as well as his need to create his own legacy simultaneously. He has too much pride to take up his father's name in the ring specifically because it will make the public have high expectations for him.In the film, Adonis' relationship with Rocky proves to be a great cinematic relationship not just within the Balboa universe, but a great relationship in cinema in general. The two of them redefine what it means to be family and this relationship is made that more convincing due to the great strength of both of these actors (Jordan and Stallone). Jordan got snubbed of an Oscar nomination.The most brilliant scene in the movie is when Adonis fights his 16th fight. Pay attention because the entire scene is done in one amazing long take with such complex camera movement and direction, and man, does it feel perfect.The biggest flaw of the film is that it seems to steal plot points from Rocky. It is not an identical film, but the main beats are very similar. But looking at 2015 as a whole, this is definitely one of the better films.3.5/4.0",9,6,9,21 February 2016
Hot Fuzz," A Truly Great Mix of Comedy, Mystery, and Action
","Hot Fuzz is a rare gem that is surprisingly better than its critical acclaim. It is a film that can easily be enjoyed as long as you don't mind its gratuitous violence at parts, but it is not the type of film that would garnish nominations for awards since it is more about entertainment than dramatic intent. It's sad that this is the case because it proves to be a solid movie through and through, breaking various conventions to make it stand out as well as implementing humor that is well beyond the likes of many comedies which come out in this day and age.From the start, the film has a recognizable distinct style involving high intensity editing and excellent cinematography. The opening sequence features a monologue by Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) highlighting his amazing credentials as a police officer in London over a montage of his work in the field which supports those credentials. The visual style that is established in this sequence engages the viewer and proves to never be a bore as it is used throughout the film.Once again, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are at the core of the movie, and their relationship in this film is much more interesting than their relationship in the predecessor of this film in the Cornetto trilogy: Shaun of the Dead. Whereas in Shaun of the Dead the two were great friends and the core problem was that Frost's character somewhat held Pegg back, in this film Pegg and Frost develop an unlikely friendship after Pegg mentors Frost throughout the film on how to improve as a police officer. On the other hand, Pegg learns from Frost that there is excitement in being a police officer (as seen through action movies which Frost's character is captivated by) and that Pegg should not take the job (and life for that matter) too seriously.The solution to the 'mystery' in the film seems too obvious as it is heavily implied in the first half of the film, but the truth and motivation is so unexpected it actually produces laughs with its shock factor. After this reveal, Hot Fuzz takes a turn to be more dramatic and features an action-packed third act which proves to be great fun.Smart, well-made, and hilarious, Hot Fuzz is the type of film that would simply be a shame to miss out on.4.0/4.0",10,1,1,16 January 2016
Spotlight," A Modern Day 'All the President's Men'
","The politics in this movie will probably earn it some Oscar nominations, because if there's anything we know about the Academy it's that it loves historically or politically significant movies (The Imitation Game, American Sniper, The Theory of Everything as nominations for Best Picture just from last year). This movie will be a shoe-in for the nomination, but more importantly it deserves the nomination.The issue depicted in the film may seem a little dated (the story takes place in 2001) but it is nonetheless an important issue to discuss. The movie is somewhat aware of this as there are constant references to the fact that The Boston Globe could have exposed this issue of priests molesting children years ago and it is a mystery why they did not.Most people would probably describe the film as being slow-paced, to which I would respond that the movie wouldn't accomplish anything more than if it was edited to have a faster pace. This film needs to fill the audience in on details, and the audience is aware of that. It allows the audience to get the full impact of what is at issue here if we follow the journalists' investigation step by step.Spotlight has an ensemble cast of A-list actors including Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, and John Slattery, who all deliver great performances. I predict that Ruffalo will be nominated as Best Supporting Actor for the second year in a row. There is a moment in the film when his character has to show determination and frustration simultaneously as his suggestion is denied by Keaton's character, and at this point in the story we are forced to side with Ruffalo and the scene is heartbreaking.While the cast as a whole is great, we only get tiny insights into other characters' motivations and perspectives, but these glimpses still illustrate who the characters are perfectly. For example, one of the team members realize there is a pedophile priest living just a block away from him, and his first thought is to protect the children of the area. He cannot warn the children, however, until the story is released, once again making us question the decisions made by the executives at The Boston Globe.My last comment is that this film is never visually interesting, but political dramas like this are not meant to be great works of art; rather, they are meant to create a cohesive story with well- developed characters to root for, and the film does exactly that and more. These types of film rely on realism, and while they are not necessarily documentaries, they need to inform us of real-world issues, and Spotlight never fails at doing so.4.0/4.0",10,4,9,21 November 2015
Milk," Gay or Not, This is A Film You Must See
","Though I have only seen 3 of his films, Gus Van Sant seems to be a mastermind at bringing characters to life in his films. The 3 I have seen are this, Good Will Hunting, and Elephant, and I honestly can't say which of the three is my favorite; they are all so good. With Milk, Gus Van Sant motivates and inspires the audience with a message of hope, and though the events of the film are from the late 70s, the issues are more relevant now that we are in the middle of fighting for gay marriage rights and the U.S. is less populated with homophobes. Here is a film which was better than the best picture winner of its year: Slumdog Millionaire.First of all, do not be afraid to see sexual scenes between men in this movie; the only scene which is almost explicit is very darkly lit and hard to see. While the film has moments depicting homosexuality, it does this to show the characters in this film who are fighting for their rights are caring, loving people who deserve to be treated as human beings. It is rather sad to watch scenes in which it is explained or almost shown that homosexuals are getting beaten to death by police.Penn is miraculous in this film, and honestly even though James Franco is not a marvelous actor overall, he also does a pretty good job with his performance in this film. Penn steals the show though, rightfully winning an Oscar by immersing himself in this character that not only has a different sexual orientation as the actor, but also experienced his 40s in a very different time period. He is a character so loving that even when his friends question his romantic interest with a character named Jack, he defends himself by saying Jack needs him and he is willing to care for Jack even though he is not 'all right' mentally. It is devastating to see Jack go in this film, though it feels more suitable that Milk is with Scott, the James Franco character. The only thing I didn't care for in the way that Milk was depicted is that at times he seemed interested in other men while in a relationship with another person, and little reason was given to this portrayal beside the fact that the man was gay, which is not how it works at all.One thing which was a little unclear to me while watching this film was Dan White's feud with Milk; it was clear they made a deal to swap votes for each other, but it was hard to pick up on what White wanted Milk to vote for - this is probably my fault as I should have paid more careful attention. When I read that it was about having a psychiatric hospital in White's district I thought the issue could have been more dramatic, but this is a film based on real events, and when a film is going for an important historical feel, it seems right to keep the story accurate.Seeing this film makes me want to fight for gay rights and I am extremely proud to say that. Milk states in the film though that it is not just about homosexuals, but about other ethnicities as well - nobody should be discriminated against when it comes to civil rights. The last line of the film is one which is repeated throughout the movie, and while it is a simple line, Penn seems to give it great meaning with the way he says it into the tape recorder which is essentially the vehicle of narration for the film.A must-see film.",10,0,2,9 June 2015
The Terminator," 'I'll be Back' makes me Excited to Watch Judgment Day Again
","This is a good science-fiction movie, and I especially like the paradox which involves the birth and existence of John Connor. Arnold Schwarzenegger is good as the titular character since his role calls for the acting skills he can provide: the acting skills needed for a robot.The premise is simpler than I expected it to be: kill Sarah Connor to prevent the birth of a hero named John Connor. Sadly, there is not much characterization coming from Sarah Connor until the last few minutes of the movie. It is disappointing that the focus of the film is on Schwarzenegger since poor special effects make up the terminator's face once he tears his own eyeball out.Sadly this film is nowhere on the same scale as the sequel, but I guess being made 7 years earlier, this movie was bound to have lesser special effects than the 2nd one. But it is not just the special effects; like Alien being compared to Aliens, this film just has less action due to less extras (in this case, less police) than the sequel, which makes for a less exciting adventure movie.I didn't mind the movie, but I don't see all the fuss about why this is so iconic. I have more interest in the characters as well as the action in Judgment Day. Finally, I have to say it is really cool how The Terminator is both on the top 50 villains and top 50 heroes lists according to AFI.",8,0,2,6 April 2015
The Hateful Eight," Tarantino Does it Again
","To get the full effect of the movie I would recommend that you see the 70mm roadshow version before it's too late. The overture and intermission (with somewhat of an entr'acte leading into act 2) along with the fact that the movie was filmed with the same lenses used to film Ben-Hur bring back a method of exhibition I was never able to experience before in my lifetime.I admit I have a bias towards Tarantino, but honestly there were only a few flaws in the film, unlike what all the haters are saying. So before I get into the positives I'm going to refute the negatives. I've read this film is too long and 'overwritten.' Incorrect. I can't speak for the digital version yet, but the intermission gives you a chance to breathe before watching the second half of the film. Also, it may have a long duration, but (to me at least) it didn't feel THAT long. The dialogue is compelling enough to keep you on the edge of your seat since it gets very tense from time to time.Another claim is that the mystery is not clever. While I would say yes to this, I would respond by saying that as you're experiencing the movie you come to realize that it really isn't trying to be clever, especially with Chapter Five following the 'reveal' at the end of Chapter Four. Tarantino may have described it is like an Agatha Christie story, but who said he was trying to make a mystery as fully fleshed out as her stories? This is one of the reasons that justifies why the mystery aspect of the movie didn't come across clearly in the trailers. Although, to be fair, the main plot of this movie is difficult to explain, but the trailer does its best with Kurt Russell's 'I'm taking this woman to hang' segment. The main problem I have with this film is basically the same one I had with Reservoir Dogs: it is a movie specifically focused on an ensemble, yet some of the main ensemble do not receive as much screen time and character development as others.These flaws are minor, and the pros heavily outweigh the cons. If you're experiencing this movie with a multitude of Tarantino fans as I did you're going to laugh at all the right moments. This is actually one of the funniest Tarantino movies I have ever seen, delivering great comic bits even in the most dramatic and tense sequences of the movie. Tarantino should honestly be the name of a genre in itself since he combines the comic with the dramatic time and time again within his films.This film is bloody as can be expected. And while some will have to avert their eyes from what happens on the screen, it is once again violence that is more ridiculous than disturbing or upsetting. But don't get me wrong, if you're not used to Tarantino violence, this movie may scar you mentally.My favorite sequence in the film is what occurs just before intermission because it made my jaw drop. You want to love Marquis Warren (Jackson), but this truly is The Hateful Eight, and you will hate him at the conclusion of the first half.Overall this movie seems like 2 different movies, the first seeming longer since it needs to establish what is happening in the first 3 chapters. And the last three chapters seem to go by quickly with all the fun Tarantino traits packed into them - you know, like Tarantino making a 'cameo' by narrating in a comic manner, a jump in chronology - revitalizing the good ol' days of Pulp Fiction - and all the blood, humor, and intensity you can ask for.Finally, this film is simply satisfying at its conclusion which always sells a movie in my book. See this film!4.0/4.0",10,7,29,26 December 2015
Alien," Good Mix of Different Genres
","To say this movie is a good movie in relation to the 'body genre' is an understatement. I got a very upset stomach when John Hurt's character had an alien bulging through his chest. I knew the iconic scene before viewing the movie, but actually watching the film made it affect me so much more. I also nearly had a headache towards the conclusion when there were strobe lights flashing in order to build the tension for the climax. This is strange and impressive because my body usually does not respond to films that much, even in the 'body genres.'I watched this in a science-fiction film class, but we were discussing it and it is almost ambiguous as to whether this film more readily fits into the sci-fi or horror genre. The heavily black mise-en-scene would point to horror, but the ideas of aliens and robots easily puts this film into the sci-fi genre.The pace of this film is very peculiar to me. On one hand, it is particularly slow towards the beginning of the film, which made it enjoyable as a faster-paced film once the conflict with the titular alien arises, but this fast pace almost skipped information in my opinion. What I noticed was that once the alien starts attacking the various crew members, the members would die, but then the film would quickly cut to the characters back at the safe part of the ship either discussing the death or holding something the character had on him/her right before they died. These quick cuts imply that the characters found the bodies and returned without trouble; wouldn't it make more sense to show them going to find the bodies to build even more suspense since the audience would question whether the alien moved on or not? Isn't it possible the alien would still be with the bodies?After a lot of exposition, a face-hugger clamps itself onto the John Hurt character, and while Ripley wants to leave him in order to follow protocol, the audience wants to see them take care of the man; all of the audience except me, that is. I know the alien needs to get onto the ship in order for the film to have relevance as a horror film, but I found Ripley's reasoning to be past logical - it's the only reaction that makes sense, but I guess we want to see people sticking out for each other, so the alien gets on board. Thanks Ash, you company man cyborg.Other than these complaints I have, this film does an excellent job at evoking bodily responses which makes for a fun, yet unsettling, experience. I can't wait to see what comes in store next when we watch Aliens next week.",8,1,3,25 March 2015
Horrible Bosses," It Was Hilarious the First Time...
","I'm doing a double review today of this and Horrible Bosses 2, which is playing at my dorm building's theater tonight, and I have to say I'm somewhat disappointed with this film after I have seen it so much. Noticing this film has little comedy that is actually clever or invested in character rather than just random jokes, this film merely passes as an entertaining, easy watch to me now. At its best, this film takes good philosophy from Strangers on a Train as well as Crime and Punishment and grounds it in a story that many can relate to - hating their bosses. It is also a meta-film at points, aware of and referencing other films in pop culture, even making fun of crime movies with how little money is actually in the briefcase given to Mother F***er Jones ($5000 IS a small amount of money to pay for a crime - sorry, murder consultation). The comedy of the movie is primarily driven through the characters of Dave Harken (Bateman's boss played by Kevin Spacey) and reactions/mistakes/quirkiness coming from Dale (Charlie Day's character). In 2011 my thoughts were that if Robert Downey Jr. can be nominated for an Oscar for his role in Tropic Thunder, why cannot Kevin Spacey be nominated for his great mannerisms in this comedy? Spacey is clearly the strongest actor in this movie, which is a disappointment with him getting little screen time as one of the bosses who need to go. Like most comedies this seems to be more of the 'lightly edited improv' we get instead of smarter comedies such as the recent film The World's End, which actually use visual comedy. Cinematically, the only aspects of this film I found interesting were a good time lapse that happens around Nick at the beginning of the film and the feel of a camcorder when Jones is using one at the end of the film. To enjoy it, I guess do not watch it as many times as I have and you might get some good laughs from it.",7,2,2,12 February 2015
Lost in Translation," Great Film, Some Argue little Narrative
","After reading several articles/reviews on the film, scholars seem to agree on one key factor of the film: the aesthetics create a feeling of dislocation and anxiety for the viewer. Well, at least at the start of the film. We need to watch Lost in Translation in its entirety to move from this state of anxiety to a sort of peace of mind; this film definitely toys with emotion in a brilliant manner.There are many romance stories that happen in countries outside of the US - there is especially the cliché of setting romantic stories in Paris, France. Setting one in Tokyo, however, puts American audiences in a place that seems a very long way from home since the atmosphere is so different than American culture. It also doesn't help when the only other Americans in the movie hang out at the hotel lounge where Charlotte (Johansson) sees Bob (Murray) for the first time in the film. These characters explore the city which gives them a sense of escape when they feel trapped in this foreign land.It is clear in the first 15 minutes of the film that each of these leads feel imprisoned or disconnected in this strange land - Charlotte makes a phone call in which she tries to reveal this disconnection while in tears, but the woman on the other end doesn't hear this in her voice. Bob is visiting Tokyo to make money for a whiskey commercial while he would rather be doing something with more dignity, like a play back in the states. Both characters are married, but when they begin communicating and spending time with each other, each character seems to be a little more complete than before.If looking at this movie from a narrative perspective, this seems to have a lot of the traditional second act while it rushes through act one and act three feels more ambiguous than complete for some. It still follows the traditional three act structure, but other scholars do not see it that way. There is definitely more exploration with the aesthetics of the film than there is a cohesive story, but the story is still there. To get outside of narrative you have to watch something that is practically ONLY immersed in mood/visuals such as The Tree of Life.The acting is top notch in this film, and the casting of Bill Murray is a great choice. While this may seem more of a melodrama than a romantic comedy, the comedy is still there, and Murray's screen persona fits the character of Bob Harris perfectly. Johansson is also great in one of her early roles, almost hopeless when her character feels she is no longer connecting with her husband.Definitely not your typical rom/com, but it would be a shame to miss.3.5/4.0",9,0,2,13 February 2016
Interstellar," First Official Review on a Nolan Movie
","I love Christopher Nolan. He has a distinct style, he conveys consistent/similar themes in his films, and he usually directs actors well and makes good cast choices. This film, however, falls somewhat flat for me.I'll get the spoiler out of the way because it is one of the main problems for me. This being the second time viewing the film, I looked for information on the black hole, harnessing gravity, and saw how it was explained well in the movie. What is not explained very well is why the black hole specifically sent Cooper to Murph's bookcase. He claims that 'we sent ourselves here,' but with that logic then futuristic humans needed to place the black hole/tesseract there and select for him to view the bookcase specifically. He didn't place that black hole, so how could he have sent himself there if there don't exist future humans to place it for him. Paradoxes are great in certain sci-fi films such as 12 Monkeys and Looper, but this paradox falls short of greatness.Back on Earth while Cooper is on his mission, things are pretty dead and boring. One of the most intriguing scenes is Dr. Brand's death bed reveal that he has been lying to/betraying the people at NASA, but we can't even hear all of what he is saying due to how he was directed to say it. We get he is dying, but with a barely audible voice in the mix with some eerie noise/music to set the mood. And to think that Roeper actually thought this film would win both sound-related Oscars.There are poor casting choices in this film as well. A lot of characters portray sadness in this movie, but the only actors to pull this off effectively are McConaughey and Matt Damon - plus the younger version of Murph; that scene was very emotional. Jessica Chastain, who one critic praised before the release of the film, did a sub-par job as older Murph, which is disappointing when we look at Zero Dark Thirty and her Oscar caliber performance. I didn't believe her when she cried - and even if I did she still seemed like a little girl, and not grown up as she should be. On top of this, the character comes to the conclusion that Cooper is her ghost due to revisiting her morse code notes and looking at the watch she was given by her father, which means she relatively bases this conclusion on no evidence. And really, Nolan? Topher Grace? Yeah, because it was so dramatic when you see him grab that object with the means to fight Tom off. The Earth segment of the film was just trying way too hard to be dramatic when all the real drama was happening on Cooper's voyage.I have to admit, the film intrigued me emotionally with Cooper's relationship with Murph and his struggle to prioritize the human race over family, but this film also clearly shows why Nolan is considered a very overrated director.",6,2,6,25 March 2015
Gone Baby Gone," Ben Affleck's Masterpiece
","What a truly great mystery. Gone Baby Gone has all the elements any good mystery story should have - misdirection, crazy twists and turns, and bloodshed (just to add to the excitement). The all-star cast especially elevates Gone Baby Gone to heights that exceed most mysteries and thrillers produced in this day and age.The person who earned this film an Oscar nomination: Amy Ryan. Rightfully so. Appearing in supporting roles in both The Office and The Wire, Amy Ryan goes well out of her comfort zone to play a druggie coked out of her mind, conflicted emotionally over her missing child (at points she can care less, at others it is heartbreaking how she takes it). It is difficult not to marvel at Ryan's performance; she is completely believable as being psychologically disturbed which is rare from an actress who is sane in her other roles (well, at least in The Wire). It is very difficult to pull off being a convincing drug addict, and Ryan is arguably the best part of this film.The plot is on and off at points; in the first half of the film it is easy to notice that something seems 'off,' but it is hard to put a finger on it, making the audience question the events as a good mystery should. The outcome of a mystery should be a surprise, but you don't want to keep the audience completely in the dark if you want the outcome to seem plausible. However, the logic of the situations in the first half of Gone Baby Gone does not add up in ways that are too obvious.What makes up for this? Practically everything else about the film. The story eventually gets to a point where the morality of certain situations and choices is questioned by both the characters and the audience, and with good reason too. Movies are meant to be about the human condition, and when you have a film like Gone Baby Gone pose difficult questions of what is ethical, or what the greater good is in certain situations, you have an outstanding movie (and it helps when the twist of any mystery is very unexpected).Gone Baby Gone is an overlooked work by Ben Affleck. It is his best film, but it did not get the recognition it deserved when it was released.4.0/4.0",10,1,3,18 February 2016
Ant-Man," Actually Very Funny
","This isn't one of the best Marvel origin stories out there, but I was unexpectedly very entertained by this movie. If there is anything that has been consistent in this Marvel universe (at least from what I've seen, haven't seen The Incredible Hulk) it's a great comedic tone to lighten things up.To me, at least, the basic premise of a superhero whose power is to shrink but maintain human strength is a little boring to me. What wasn't boring once I actually decided to give it a chance was the training Paul Rudd's character had to go through to master the capabilities of the suit he is given by his 'mentor,' played by Michael Douglas. It is amusing to see Paul Rudd repeatedly fail to jump through a keyhole; it is a simple moment in the movie that we can relate to since we all make mistakes and need to try things again from a different approach. It is also relieving to see him terrified of ants at that size because I would hate that.The movie is almost self-aware that it is a Marvel movie, bringing in elements of the Marvel universe for jokes. At one point, the titular Ant-Man suggests to call the Avengers to do Douglas' work to which his response is basically 'I don't want them knowing about this.' Let's be honest, they could have done better than this. And we actually see Ant-Man fight a to-be-Avenger which is a funny scene, but they don't really explain why nobody is training at their facility that day except for Falcon.Most of the humor comes from Rudd's character blowing things up in size during a fight towards the film's conclusion, but my favorite part of this movie has to be Michael Pena's character. He over- explains things and is excited when he does so, and this reminds me of a particular family member of mine, so I found it very amusing.The story itself is just okay which is why I only consider this movie to be a decent Marvel movie, probably somewhere in the middle of the list if I were to rank the Marvel movies I have seen. Essentially an apprentice of Douglas wants to use the technology for the shrinking suit as a weapon to be produced for the military's use, so essentially we have a want-to-be arms dealer trying to make a profit from the Douglas character's idea.This movie is certainly not up to par with the Avengers movies, but you should see it if you want to experience one of the funnier Marvel movies.",8,1,9,30 July 2015
Fargo," Amazing
","As we read the text informing us that Fargo is a true story (which is a lie), we are introduced to the somber music which contains a medieval feel to it, being performed on harp to start, then switching to the use of more strings and drums. This small portion of music is powerful in that it conveys exactly the tone of the movie: we know collectively as an audience that this will be an upsetting story which takes place in a fairly 'innocent' location – Minnesota.Why is this film titled 'Fargo,' exactly? It is where everything is set into motion. The William H. Macy character (Lundegaard) drives up there to meet the two 'villains' of the story who he employs to kidnap his wife so that they may con money from his wife's father. We don't know this right away, however; in fact, the information we're told is only certain bits, so we cannot fathom how simple this rather complex plan really is at first. Making the situation complex for the viewer, however, lets us know that anything can and will go wrong – and what do you know, it does.While Frances McDormand may be the protagonist of the story, let's talk first about the best talent in this film – William H Macy. After watching this film, without knowledge of the show 'Shameless,' I doubt anybody could predict this actor would be a good fit for Frank Gallagher in Shameless – stubborn as hell, alcoholic, selfish, terrible father, anything but respectable. In Fargo, Macy portrays Lundegaard with perfect execution, a role on the opposite pole of his iconic Frank Gallagher. Lundegaard is a first time criminal, and it shows through the fact that he is an every-day-nice-guy, not very outspoken, and holds in his anger so much that he explodes when he needs to let it out. Macy tackles the overall nervousness of the character so well that he develops perfect mannerisms for the character – looking down due to shyness frequently, moments of losing control that are just right and not overly dramatic, stuttering, and a stupid smile to retain his innocence despite the horrific plot he carries out, putting his family in danger time and time again. Macy's portrayal is arguably the best performance of the film, yet he lost the best supporting Oscar to none other than Cuba Gooding Jr's role in 'Jerry Maguire' that year.Another strong aspect of the film is the character played by Steve Buscemi. Everybody thinks it, and the Coen brothers say it time and time again in their script: Steve Buscemi sure is a 'funny-looking fellow.' This is brought up at least twice by witnesses in the case – one prostitute and one bartender, who act as substitutes for the audience, the voyeur, the cinephile who observes and comments, but does not contribute much to the actual story. Buscemi's character is egotistical, funny, filled with rage; he is given authority which he does not deserve as Shep, who put Lundegaard in contact with Buscemi's friend, did not vouch for the Buscemi character. Buscemi is the comic relief to his counter part's scary, more dominating and menacing presence – he is a giant compared to Buscemi and does not talk unless it has to do with the job they have set out to do. This seems to be one of the only reasons Buscemi has to do practically everything – he goes alone on the actual 'exchange' of the money and Mrs. Lundegaard, leaving only him to have to deal with the near- fatal surprise in store for him. He returns with the money for his partner (though he does not tell him there is much more buried in the middle of nowhere) and he rightfully complains that Gaear did not suffer an injury like him, though his deception is greedy and egotistical. It turns out that Gaear has a greedy nature too, possibly much greedier than Carl (Buscemi) since he thinks a sum of only eighty thousand dollars is involved and his reaction is very extreme.Then we have Frances McDormand, playing Marge Gunderson, the protagonist who does not show up until thirty minutes into the film. If it were not for the presence of this character in the film, this movie would be an extremely depressing story. Marge represents the average Minnesota citizen who finds happiness with the simplicity of family life. She serves the police force as she serves her family – she is the sole breadwinner for her and her husband Norm, and she is pregnant, yet embarks on this mysterious, dangerous journey to find two murderers in order to put them behind bars. Her short speech to Gaear towards the end of the film is exactly what the film needs – it is reassurance that we are not alone in this world when we don't understand the evil behind greed which drives people to do the most awful things and strive so far from morality. One final comment is that I love the presence of the character Mike Yanagita in this film. Most people would find this character to simply be a comic relief character, but as my brother pointed out, the fact that he lied about his life and was so convincing about it drives Marge to return to Lundegaard, who appeared to be just as innocent as Mike on the surface. To be honest, I thought this character was simple comic relief on first impression, but this didn't make too much sense to me since it did not drive the story further if that was the case, and I knew the Coen brothers are considered great filmmakers.I very strongly recommend this film to all viewers who are comfortable with watching an R-rated film: it is simply one of the greatest dark comedies/crime dramas ever made.",10,0,0,27 July 2015
The Thing," Who Can We Trust?
","I was very surprised by what this film achieved. I went in with low expectations even though it had a spot on IMDb's 250; man was I wrong.From the start of the film we are immediately asking questions for which we want answers. Is that helicopter crew shooting at the dog? What are they afraid of? Why did they attempt to destroy the American base in Antarctica? When these questions are answered, we ask the more important question: which of these men have been infected by the titular 'thing?'Such a simple premise, yet so powerful to get our hearts racing and question humanity. Blair may seem mad, but he is very rational trying to destroy transportation so the thing cannot reach the world outside of Antarctica. What I love is that saving humanity is an implied motivation for various characters within the film, but it is hardly stated by any of the characters.This movie is a thrill ride, science fiction film with a concept not unlike 'And Then There Were None.' One thing bothered me in this film: remember how I said Blair is rational? This is due to a lazy bit of writing, in which a computer states before the camera that humanity could be wiped out in a short amount of time due to this thing, and this is based on a few seconds of analysis by the computer. I just found it cheesy.The conclusion of the film had me in awe, questioning humanity while the two survivors simply wait for a sign that either of them are a double until they ultimately perish.",10,6,11,24 February 2015
The Revenant," Great Acting and Visuals
","This film seems unlike any revenge film to come before this one. It is incredibly well-shot, it is brutal and intense, well-acted, and it takes place in the early days of America when Native Americans and Caucasians didn't get along so well. Tension between these two very broad groups is what drives the action in the film's opening sequence, and it is a motif throughout the film.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hugh Glass, a man who raised a young Native American named Hawk on his own after the boy's parents either abandoned him or died in a battle. Glass fights a bear and miraculously survives to be buried alive by Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) who wants to cash in on this 'service' since he has somewhat of a feud with Glass and does not want to see him live. It is unclear whether Glass is okay with this since he technically 'makes a deal' with Fitzgerald, but Glass gains the will to fight for survival once he realizes Hawk was killed by Fitzgerald.A huge chunk of the film is devoted to following Glass' journey to return to his community, and this proves to be visually beautiful, but also causes the film to feel slow at points. There are incredible shots of Glass in relation to the land around him, which proves to show scenery and landscapes in a poetic manner. One impressive shot is a tracking shot which moves from an extreme wide shot which focuses on the mountains with Glass as tiny as an ant in the distance and eventually moves to a close-up on the same character. There are many long takes in the film that are executed brilliantly, some during action sequences and some when Glass is simply walking on his journey. However, as the story follows Glass on his journey, some of the scenic shots go on too long and seem monotonous since we understand that Glass has to go a long way, but the film keeps reminding us this with more and more scenic shots that don't move the story along.DiCaprio is at his best here, and will probably receive his fifth Oscar nomination for acting. Whether or not he will actually win the award as fans often complain about, his performance in The Revenant will live on in history. Glass' desperation comes across very convincingly even though DiCaprio does not even need to speak throughout a lot of the movie. That's the real acting - when actors can express emotions and motivation clearly through body language rather than how they handle dialogue.Every action sequence in this movie is incredible. Most are done in just a few long takes which means these sequences needed to be really well-choreographed in order to get the shots right. And these sequences were on location rather than in a studio, so one has to respect the direction and the cinematography that was done with amazing effort outside in cold environments.If there is one thing to take away from The Revenant it is the visuals. It's funny that not many movies are done this way today even though filmmakers know that film is a very visual medium. Innaritu understands this very well as we can see in Birdman as well as in this movie, and hopefully he inspires the next generation of filmmakers to follow in his footsteps.3.5/4.0",9,8,17,8 January 2016
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Great Sci-Fi
","What a great piece of science-fiction. Entertaining in many different ways, one of my favorite being crazy Sarah Connor. Her character is a lot more interesting this time around, even if she starts the movie in a mental hospital.What adds to the fun is the fact that this is much funnier than the first, and in unexpected ways. Just wait until young John Connor tries to teach the Terminator how to smile. A lot of humor revolves around the John Connor/Terminator relationship within the film.Also, the new gender-neutral liquid-metal Terminator is bad-ass, but I also think the worst aspect of the film is with that Terminator in the third act of the film. The evil Terminator is really bad at trying to kill the Connors and/or the Arnold Schwarzenegger Terminator. There are points where the new Terminator just stands there when he can be attacking his targets. He takes an unnecessarily long time to get to his targets, and I guess this is so that he may be destroyed.I've heard the films following this one in the franchise are not as good, and honestly I can't see another Terminator movie being made that can top this one. Great film, very entertaining.",9,2,4,15 April 2015
The Battle of Algiers," Great at the End, Very Political Before Then
","From the title I expected this to be a war movie, but I did not realize Algiers is a city, and the battle is actually a struggle for Algerians to live in their home country without fear of the French who are suppressing them.I've seen very critically acclaimed classic foreign films before, so I guess I might have had my expectations too high. For example, two of my favorite foreign films are 'Bicycle Thieves' and 'Rashomon,' but those films actually do interesting things with their camera-work. With The Battle of Algiers we just get a lot of standard (boring) camera-work with a lot of static shots to focus on conversations about the action rather than focusing on the action itself.The best aspect of the film is the characters who are a part of the rebellion and their motivations. We are introduced to one of the main characters in a very interesting way - this secret group of rebels does an initiation on Ali by checking to see if he would be loyal enough to shoot a cop, but they don't tell him this. We can see the manipulation this group exercises, though in their eyes it is necessary recruitment, and we should see it as this too since it is the Algerians who are the victim to French occupation of the city of Algiers as well as of the entire nation of Algeria.With the filmmakers choosing to revisit a scene from different view points there is obviously non-linear chronology, but I only understood this at the beginning and towards the end of the film. I was confused how the scene fit into the scenes surrounding it when it was shown for the second time in the film. I will have to rewatch this film some time in the future - after all it is regarded as one of the most important films ever made.I think I enjoyed the conclusion of this film much more than any part which preceded it, and that's because the conclusion is the most inspirational sequence of the entire movie. It is uplifting to see how Algerians rise up again years after the first rebellion group is decapitated (a metaphor you will understand if you watch the film), and this happens without great explanation. The message implied by the film is that this first group of rebels may not have been successful, but the group inspired the people of its nation to stand strong for justice.",8,0,1,13 July 2015
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Okay For a While, Then a Great Third Act
","While the opening of the film featured a very cool stunt involving Tom Cruise actually hanging on the side of an airplane (with a huge strap digitally removed, of course) it was very abrupt and felt like any average action sequence from the series so far, so after that I wasn't very excited and had to wonder what this film had in store for the rest of it.Ethan Hunt faces one of his toughest challenges yet: instead of being called upon for a mission by IMF, his mission briefing at the beginning is actually a challenge by an organization known as the Syndicate, which is basically a 'nation' of rogue agents who have joined forces, hence the title. While you think this would be a great premise for action and tension it doesn't really pay off until the third act, which I will get to later.The writers of this film really seemed to not know what they wanted from the leading lady. In the scene which introduces her, we understand she wants to help IMF though she is posing as a member of the Syndicate. She explains to Hunt that for him to continue his effort against the Syndicate she needs the Syndicate to trust her. After this, there are moments where it is clear she is on the side of the IMF team, though the writers through curveballs left and right for us to question her loyalty, which isn't confusing, just really annoying. It is even confusing when people from London come into play with her and they basically screw her over, ridding her of the Macguffin of the film, which they know she needs to earn the Syndicate's trust. Do they just want her dead? Did they plan that so the villain wouldn't get what he needs? So not only is it a question of who she is loyal to, but who really trusts her as well.The third act of the film is great, as one of the scenes is particularly tense - perhaps the most tense scene from the entire series, and the way the conflict of the film gets resolved is dark, clever, and fitting in that it parallels a scene at the very beginning of the film. I'm trying to avoid spoilers as much as I can, but you'll know what I'm talking about if you see the movie.Maybe I just have to rewatch this in order to appreciate it as a whole, but the third act of this film is probably one of the best third acts I've seen from an action film period. It is probably in my top 2 of the Mission Impossible series, though that isn't saying it's necessarily great, but pretty good.3.0/4.0",8,0,2,12 August 2015
Aliens," More Exciting than the First
","I appreciated Alien for its good mix of the sci-fi and horror genres. While Alien made me sick to my stomach, Aliens entertained me more than it scared or shocked me. More goofy characters and more aliens makes for more fun in my book.I really like how we don't have a firm grasp on what is reality or a dream in the first few scenes of the film since Ellen jolts awake a few times. Some of the content in the dream, however, is grounded in reality however since it is said she has slept for 57 years both in the dream and reality.Once again, however, the entire film could have been avoided if people just listened to Ripley. There would have been no alien on the ship in the first if the crew would have agreed with Ripley's logic following protocol, and here her warning is not heeded since people now live on the planet where she encountered the alien.What is interesting is that while the film has similar elements to the first, they are still different in little ways. For example, this film has a villain who prioritizes capturing an alien to study, but he is human in this one as opposed to the cyborg Ash in the first.While the first film is meant to humanize Ripley, this one humanizes here even more with her effort to protect the young girl Newt. It gets to us when Newt calls Ripley 'momma' at the conclusion, showing this girl acts as a surrogate child after Ripley's actual daughter died when she was in hyper sleep.As for the rest of the film, not too many complaints. The suspense and action is great, Bill Paxton is great as a cowardly hot-head in one of his early roles, and the magnitude of the film is so much higher than the first - they practically fight an army of aliens instead of just one, and I love a good action film that ups the stakes.",8,0,4,1 April 2015
Ocean's Eleven," The Plan is Almost Too Perfect
","This was a movie that kind of confused me as a kid in that this was one of the first movies I saw where the protagonists commit a crime. I remember asking my dad, 'so these are the bad guys?' His response was along the lines of 'well, they may be stealing something but they're still the good guys.' I still liked the movie as a kid, but this concept confused me a little bit. Many years later, it is still a delightful B movie to watch.It is pretty awesome that they have so many people on their team to create an ensemble cast, but some of them get barely any screen time when I would want to see an equal balance of the cast. For example, all we know about the little acrobat is that he is really good at what he does since he doesn't speak much English, besides dropping the second use of 'f***' in the movie. We also don't delve too deep into the back story of certain characters, such as the oldest member on the team. We know all of these guys either have a connection to Ocean or Pitt's character or that they are found, and for this senior citizen we know he has a connection to Pitt's character and that is about it.The funniest bits of the film come from the twins, one of whom is played by Casey Affleck, who really gets how annoying his character is supposed to be. One of my favorite parts of the film is when Affleck's character's toy car is going faster than his brother's monster truck just to get destroyed by his brother.Getting back to the point of the movie, the heist seems to go way too smoothly, which is meant to satisfy the viewers I guess, but a great film requires conflict - no matter if it is external or internal - but this film's struggle seems mainly to be internal struggles within Ocean and his enemy played by Andy Garcia. One is trying to win his ex- wife back, and the other is dying inside as his money is getting stolen. As Brad Pitt's character points out, it is really selfish of Ocean to concoct this plan with some motivation to win Tess back. Romance makes a good subplot in movies - in fact a lot of producers want at least some type of romance in their movies - and while it holds up and illustrates that Ocean is a better man than Garcia's character, but it seems to stray from the focus on the rest of the team.While watching this my friends were pointing out how gadgets in this movie go unexplained, especially for a film released in 2001 where this type of technology wasn't even in many James Bond films. Each step of the plan seems to go almost too well, with the exception that they almost blow the acrobat away.This is an enjoyable heist film that makes us feel for Ocean, but I wish there was more connection to the other characters in the film.",7,1,3,2 May 2015
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Style Over Substance
","Scott Pilgrim is good fun from director Edgar Wright. The cinematography and visual effects really capture the video game feel of the movie perfectly. That being said, the intended audience for this film seems a little more limited than Wright's 'Cornetto' trilogy - this movie has created a cult following by the younger generation or anybody who loves classic video games, but the focus on Canadian teenagers and the many homages to video games makes this story less relatable than any of the films in the Cornetto trilogy.Towards the beginning of the story we sympathize with Scott's young girlfriend, Knives, who seems like such a good kid and makes us wonder how Scott can break this girl's hot. Well there's the answer - a mysterious girl Scott's own age with pink hair who he is simply more attracted to and starts stalking (not to an extreme level though). Many references to past girlfriends, however, makes us wonder how Scott is such a stud since he is played by Michael Cera.The premise is interesting and is obviously video-game-inspired: defeat Ramona's seven evil exes to continue dating her. The way this plot is revealed does not seem forced either, as Scott is unexpectedly attacked by the first ex while he is still juggling Knives and Ramona and has no idea what is going on.Aside from the great action sequences littered with jokes and references to video games, the overall humor of the film is its greatest highlight. Michael Cera may be quirky and a bit of a geek, but it is in a lovable manner. Scott's roommate is gay, but not just for the sake of being gay - he is able to turn straight guys gay with little explanation, and it is also funny to see Scott and him to share the same bed (mattress) making us question Scott's sexuality.Even the supporting cast is well cast with big names like Mae Whitman and Chris Evans, who each prove to be great caricatures for Scott/Ramona to fight. Chris Evans' scene may be the best scene of the whole film - he plays his part perfectly and draws big laughs as an overly macho actor.What this film lacks is great substance. It may be a great romantic comedy for its comedy, but the romance is not well-executed. Not only that, but the film constantly makes the audience question which girl Scott should pursue, Knives or Ramona, and it seems odd that Scott would go to such great lengths to 'save' Ramona when Knives seems to be the better person by default. The only gratification that comes from Scott wanting to break up with Knives is the fact that he no longer has a creepy relationship (she is only 17). But in early scenes within the film, no matter how creepy this relationship, it is clear the two were made for each other. Oh well.Scott Pilgrim vs The World immerses the audience in its great style, but the story is hindered by its lack of substance.3.0/4.0",7,0,2,26 February 2016
Inside Out," Best Movie of 2015 So Far!!!
","To break down Inside Out is to break down the mind and all of its beautiful complexities. While the idea of characterizing the emotions of the human is not exactly original (look up the short play 'Bob's Date') PIXAR tackles it in a very original way. The organization of the mind may seem simple at first in this film, but we see through the amazing digital set designs in Inside Out that the mind is highly complex, and its various parts or sections are very dependent on each other. I am not saying we did not know the mind is complex, but the film illustrates the mind with an original layout while letting the audience know it is still complex.While the focus is highly on how the emotions control the person, the person herself, Riley, is very crucial to the story. She is a very joyful kid who finds herself moving to a new area with her family in the opening credit sequence. This happens to put Riley, as well as her emotions, through new obstacles, and the protagonist, Joy, struggles to keep Riley happy for the first time in their lives. This leads to an event which separates Joy and Sadness from the headquarters, and Riley's mood becomes similar to depression, though it is never labeled as such but is heavily implied.What the film beautifully illustrates is the idea that when people have crises, the mind itself is having its own crisis to create or add to the external problems - a beautiful correlation between the external and the internal. The primary struggle is between Joy and Sadness, and it starts out as Joy attempting to suppress Sadness as much as possible and moves towards Joy finding worth in Sadness gradually. This relationship moves towards one of the most sentimental scenes in the history of PIXAR, which brought this viewer to tears.Aside from having a great story structure and a great character arc for both Joy and Sadness, Inside Out is hilarious throughout with great running gags and clever moments which give character to aspects of the mind other than the emotions (if you really want to laugh, stay for the footage during the credits, and keep in mind there is nothing AFTER the credits). Dreaming is treated like a movie set - an idea that is supposedly illustrated in Inception if viewers pay enough attention - and Fear becomes a sort of film critic for a brief segment. For the funniest running gag in the film, all I will say is it involves when songs get stuck in the head.This movie cleverly and ironically makes the audience feel the best of joy with its comedy as well as the worst of sadness/sympathy with its sentimental moments. It is simply a must-see film - one of the best PIXAR movies to date, and my favorite to have been directed by Pete Docter!",10,6,31,18 June 2015
Independence Day," A Great 'Popcorn' Movie
","Most seem to say this is a terrible film, but I just find it so damn exciting! It doesn't exactly lack content, but I admit some of its content is over-the-top at times.We are flooded with iconography of American culture at the opening of the film, such as a plaque we left behind on the moon saying that we 'came in peace' with the original mission. Then, after a shadow passing over the moon, foreshadowing danger, we see many icons such as the statue of liberty, the Iwo Jima Flag monument and the Washington monument. We are shown America as a striving world power throughout the film.While the film touches on unity from people of different status/ethnicity/gender, it mainly does this with American characters. Other nationalities are conveyed as the U.S. sends them information on how to defeat the aliens through Morse code. This is a little disappointing from a film that is about unity between nations to fight a danger from another world.What bothers me is that we are given the aliens' motivation rather abruptly through the fictional President portrayed by Bill Pullman who just happens to 'see' their intent, and the intent is somewhat stupid coming from an 'intelligent' species.What this movie lacks in intellect (which isn't as much as harsh critics say it lacks) is entertainment and excitement, and while films are meant to make us think and portray a good story, they are also about entertaining audiences; after all, movies are money- makers. When watching this film we were bursting out laughing at certain points in the film, and rightfully so. 'Welcome to Earth' is such a great line no matter how campy it seems.This is a better movie than people may say, and although it is more about the spectacle it is much better than most Michael Bay films.",8,0,0,27 February 2015
The Fault in Our Stars," Full of Life Despite Being About Cancer Patients
","After reading the novel for a summer class (the same reason I watched the movie) I was fairly surprised at the movie's fast pace, its good cinematography, and that each character was written to be as accurate to their representation in the novel as possible (besides Hazel's Dad, I was promised a crying Dad, not a perfectly secure Dad). However, I am not going to compare the movie to the novel now as I will mostly be doing that for the class since the class focuses on adaptation.The casting for Hazel (Grace) Lancaster is near perfect in my opinion even though I had not heard of the actress before viewing the film. Shailene Woodley taps into the lead character's mind with great skill, able to depict Hazel's personality filled with sass and sarcasm as well as being able to cry on many occasions within the film without exaggerating how sad the character is supposed to be, which is usually how actors handle crying: it either doesn't happen at all, or it happens with ridiculous intensity. Woodley is able to be more subtle, handling the character near perfection. All other actors give mediocre performances, including Laura Dern (who I have never loved as an actress anyway). I wanted to like Willem Dafoe's character, but his performance seemed as though it was heavily directed and did not require any creativity from Dafoe himself.To lift the mood and ignore we are focusing on dying teenagers in this movie, it is surprisingly funny at certain points, such as when Augustus nonchalantly gives his near-blind friend Isaac permission to break his basketball trophies while maintaining a serious conversation with Hazel - his love interest, which no moment of the film lets us forget.For me, moments of this film are extremely cheesy or do not explain things well. Some terms relating to cancer which average viewers would not understand are used once or twice in the film with little explanation, and the dialogue is trying way too hard to be teenager dialogue. 'Listen douchepants,' sassy comebacks, and corny statements like 'Okay will be our always' (you probably won't understand this one out of context) are abundant in this film, exaggerating how ridiculous teenagers are or even giving them too much intelligence at times - especially Gus.This movie was surprisingly entertaining to me, and I have to admit it is a 'chick flick' which I would actually watch again without cringing in disappointment. You may not be able to handle yourself as well as I did for this story, so maybe have some tissue in the room if you're going to watch this one.",8,2,4,23 June 2015
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Great Action, A Little Hard to Follow
","It doesn't top the opening for the third installment, but the opening sequence of this film when the IMF crew is trying to break Hunt out of prison is very-well executed and action-packed, which is no surprise coming from the very 'fun' director, Brad Bird.I don't know if I ever saw the trailer for this installment in the Mission: Impossible series, so I'm not sure if this moment was shown in the trailer, but when the Kremlin explodes in the background while Ethan is running in the foreground, it startled me a great deal on my first viewing. It was a very simple, yet shocking moment in an action movie, at least to me.This sets the premise for the rest of the film: Hunt and his crew have to go rogue since IMF is implicated in the explosion of the Kremlin.The Macguffin - the launch codes - is easy enough to follow, as a Macguffin should be, but in the scene where they are making the false transactions - one for the female assassin, one for the men who need the launch codes - I never clearly heard Hunt's reasoning for giving the two men the actual launch codes. Also, I didn't understand Jeremy Renner's special contact lens - from what I understood it was able to encrypt the launch codes into a different sequence, but for who? This confused me especially since I knew they were going to supply the actual launch codes to the men who wanted them.The scene following is a phenomenal action sequence which is so tense since we, along with Ethan, cannot see what is going on in a sandstorm, and have to keep our eyes peeled to Ethan's tracking device to realize how he cuts the villain off and is about to cause a head-on collision. It still doesn't stop the villain, but it is smart to put us in the dark just like Ethan.Another aspect of the film that was a little difficult to follow - and a little boring as well - was the explanation for what happened to Ethan's wife. With film, there is usually a 'show, don't tell' principle to follow, but when Renner's character and Hunt talked about the events and what really happened to Hunt's wife, it could have used this principle instead of making us rely on every detail spoken to discern what they are talking about.This film reminded me of the first in that it was more pretentious than it should have been, but the action was much more exciting than in some of the previous films.3.0/4.0",7,0,0,9 August 2015
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," I Remember it Being Better... Then I Again I Didn't Remember it That Well
","Although I think Spielberg is an overrated director, I have to admit I really like a lot of his movies. This one is a film by Spielberg that I'm not THAT fond of.A lot of magic of the original Jurassic Park is missing in this sequel. Spielberg filled the first one with aspects of spectatorship such as the fact that the characters were on a ride in a theme park - an attraction of sorts. Screaming from the children was also a commentary on how we should react to Jurassic Park and its effects. Lost World is also lacking great subtlety which the first provided, such as the Jaws style suspense of not showing the T-Rex at first, but showing the goat disappearing without showing how.While Hammond was making a mistake in the first film according to the archaeologists and the Goldblum character, in this film he just seems plain stupid, putting people into danger again after the 'accident' at the park, as they refer to it in this film. It was also a poor choice to make the Goldblum character the main character for this sequel. Since he was made the protagonist, he had to be more serious, and the quirkiness of his character was transferred to his girlfriend played by Julianne Moore.I've been ripping on this movie for a while now, so I'll say that I enjoyed the effects that created the dinosaurs of this film just as I did with the first film. The dinosaurs still made the movie exciting, especially the addition of the small green ones which eat up people together in herds. The wonder is also missing in the sense that the dinosaurs in this film are portrayed more as dangerous than something to gaze in awe at - that's what the first film was for.A decent sequel which I wouldn't re-visit too often; I'd prefer to just watch the original Jurassic Park on its own when I get in the mood for dinosaurs.",6,4,6,17 May 2015
It Follows," Effective Horror at its Finest
","It Follows. The perfect title to understand this brilliant horror flick - two words that sum up all the great tense moments of this film with a clear explanation.The premise - this supernatural figure follows you. There is only one of it, it only walks and never runs, and it will kill you. It can look like anybody and only people who have 'had it' can see it. Why does it follow? If somebody who 'has it' has sex with you, they pass it on (a likely metaphor for STD's) and you become the new target.It may sound really simple, but that is the beauty of it. It follows you wherever you go, but it has a slow pace, not unlike a zombie. It follows you in a straight path and kills you if it has the chance to get close to you. What is creepier than basically being stalked and having no idea when your stalker will get to you?What helps induce horror in the audience is the techno, heavy-bass style music not unlike the music in horror classic Halloween by John Carpenter. It really sets the tone for the film, and has an eerie feel to it, which keeps reminding you that there is something wrong and disturbing with this world.Trust issues are a heavy theme in this film and understandably so. The main character 'gets it' from a guy she goes on a few dates with, but he explains the situation to her in order to warn her and help get her out of the situation. Guys she knows want to protect her and take 'it' away from her, but she is hesitant on letting certain people have it, especially her good friend Paul. On a couple occasions, however, characters attempt to pass it on to complete strangers - they would have no regrets if strangers die because of them. The idea of sexuality can, and should be discussed in great detail when analyzing this film.Is it a perfect film? No. I believe it is very difficult to make a 'perfect' horror movie, but this one keeps you on the edge of your seat while simultaneously making you question the idea of sex, making for a great, layered horror movie.3.5/4.0",9,2,10,30 August 2015
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," A Great Way to Start a Set of Prequels
","This was the last feature film I watched in my Special Effects class this semester, and I am so impressed by the digital effects utilized in this film. We have gone beyond motion capture into performance capture - a method of digital filmmaking which actually incorporates the actor's facial expressions and finger movements into what it captures before digitizing the look of the character over the actor's face. This trend started around the time of Avatar, but the performance is more central to this story than it was to Avatar, a film which was so obsessed in digital filmmaking that the focus was more on the overwhelmingly beautiful world than the characters.What I dislike is that people had a hard time accepting these portrayals of apes as performances, which they definitely are. Andy Serkis really deserves a nomination or at least an honorary Oscar for how he has changed the game with his incredible immersion into the roles of Gollum and now Caesar.This film provides a good story in which the James Franco character struggles to take responsibility at first, but then grows into a great caretaker as Caesar adapts to living with his own species. We start with Franco's father, played by John Lithgow, having to live with his son, but through the help of a nurse or helper. As Franco's character reluctantly takes Caesar home to prevent his death, he becomes a more loving individual, stealing from his company in order to help his father regain his memory and even his intelligence. Towards the end of the film though his story becomes sadder; he admits to his wife he 'can't lose them both,' referring to his father and Caesar, and it is more Caesar's story which gets resolved at the conclusion while Franco has to let him go.This is a really good action film which might have benefited from a little more humor, but I guess this film wasn't trying to be the typical blockbuster. It is highly entertaining to watch, and gives us great insight to the circumstances leading to the original film 'Planet of the Apes.' It may be nowhere near to how meaningful the original film is, but keep these apes coming, I'm not complaining.",9,2,3,9 May 2015
Gone Girl," Not One of Fincher's BEST, But Still Very Good
","I'm not exactly sure what to think of David Fincher as a director. Two of his movies I thought had poor endings the first time I saw them: Fight Club and The Social Network. On second viewing I loved Fight Club, kind of giving the ending a pass, and liked Social Network the second time I gave it a chance, still unsure of the ending. Now after viewing these movies a number of times I understand the significance of these endings, but do not believe they are great resolutions. For Gone Girl, the ending left me amazed and creeped out how the Rosamund Pike character won, but it doesn't make perfect sense that she got away with murder.I think some of the writing towards the beginning of the film is a little strange; I'm not sure exactly what it is, but there's something 'off' about it. This isn't really important in the grand scheme of things, but you know how Amy's life is improved upon through her parents' book series 'Amazing Amy?' 1) Why would a book series about such a perfect girl be so popular, and 2) What kind of parents do that? As Nick states: a**holes do that.The dialogue before they REALLY get into the investigation of Amy's disappearance is highly based in riddles, which are included when Nick and Amy flirt in flashback sequences. I mean I get that both of them are writers, but do they really need to be that smart all the time when they talk?Let me stray from negative criticism to say the sequence which reveals the twist of the movie is among the great sequences which Fincher has directed. In this 'montage' of sorts, the music is on- point, Amy's internal thoughts revealed in voice-over is haunting as hell, and the editing is simply perfect.The strongest aspect of this film is the performance Rosamund Pike gives by playing Amy - one of the most maniacal psychopaths I have ever seen on film. I am so glad she got an Oscar nomination for this film since she made me hate Amy so much - it's impressive when actors can get you to feel extremity of any emotion towards their character.Flaws in her not getting caught? There were cameras all over the house of the Neil Patrick Harris character that he said were recording all the time. I get that Amy fakes getting raped for the camera cleverly by biting the man's tongue and pulling down his pants so it looks like he is cleaning up after that as he exits. And I get that she poses for a camera like she was tormented. But what about the rest of the cameras in the house? Are we to believe they are only covering the perimeter of the house? Also, I forget why they can't get Nick to wear a wire around Amy - she prevents it once by talking in the shower, but is she going to be on guard the rest of her life? Highly unlikely.The fact that they make it very hard to determine whether Nick murdered Amy or not before the huge twist in the film is brilliant, making the end of act 1 and most of act 2 very strong, though the film has a weak opening and a flawed - but extremely creepy - ending. The mystery aspect and Pike's performance make this a very strong film, but it could have been improved if some content was cut and the film was more of a character study.",9,3,5,25 June 2015
Django Unchained," Simple Compared to other Works by Tarantino
","Tarantino may be well-known for his use of violence in the films he makes, but he is also great at creating complex relationships between characters and plots which need analysis, such as in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. With this film, it is pretty straightforward what the plot is: Schultz needs Django to identify and kill the Brittle Brothers and then he offers to help rescue Django's wife Broomhilda. This film is easier to follow than some of the best Tarantino films, which is good for enjoying the film but disappointing if you like Tarantino's complexity such as the out-of- chronology plot of Pulp Fiction.However, one element that is maybe better in this film than some previous Tarantino works is the use of dialogue and monologues to create elaborate metaphors through their subtext, which is surprising because Tarantino has already proved to be a master of dialogue. The best scene of this film is probably when Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) is presenting a skull of a slave to Schultz and Django and talking about dimples within the skull that represent a slave's submissiveness in order to illustrate that not just slaves, but all black people (including and especially Django) need to be put in their place. It is one of the best monologues written by Tarantino, and an accident on set made the scene even creepier: DiCaprio wasn't supposed to actually cut his hand in the scene by smashing a glass, and he wipes his actual blood on Broomhilda's (Kerry Washington's) face which elevates his menace to a whole new level. Other important dialogue in this film includes Schultz telling the legend of Broomhilda, racists complaining about the bags on their heads, and Schultz reflecting on what Alexandre Dumas would think of Candie's evilness.While I'm happy that Christoph Waltz got another Oscar for a performance in a Tarantino movie, I'm a little surprised by this at the same time. Hans Landa was a much more complex character than Schultz, and Waltz rightfully deserved his Oscar for that role, but in this film, while some moments with Schultz were undeniably funny, all I saw was a bounty hunter with great diction and good wit from time to time. I'm not saying his performance wasn't good, but attempting to look at the film objectively, I don't see how Waltz should have necessarily been the front-runner for the Oscar.I'm surprised that this film is ranked so highly on IMDb, seeing that my third favorite Tarantino film is Inglourious Basterds, but what I have to admit is that this is probably one of the funniest Tarantino films to date with many good moments where Schultz steals the scene and especially the scene with the racists complaining about bags on their faces. Even the most violent scene of the movie is funny at parts since a worker on Candie's plantation gets shot a ridiculous amount of times, sometimes by his dumb partners, and he lives longer than he should and keeps screaming and becoming more agonized throughout the shootout.I generally really like this movie, but the third act is a little disappointing in my opinion, and I think Tarantino could have written the ending in a more satisfying way if it were close to or combined with the biggest shootout of the film. But then again, I guess an ending like that would have been too simple or would have seemed like a cop out. What Django has to say at the end of the film is pretty great though, and I wouldn't change that a thing about that, but towards the end of the film it seemed 20 minutes longer than it should have been.A very good Tarantino movie (though when is he NOT good?), but not one of his best. But maybe I'm of that unpopular opinion because I have a bias towards Westerns? Who knows?3.5/4.0",9,0,1,16 August 2015
The Theory of Everything," Extremely Well-Acted
","I really liked it better when there were only 5 nominees for the Oscar for Best Picture (even when Dark Knight didn't get nominated and fanboys went crazy) because it recognized a smaller collection of movies that were more deserving of the award, let alone the nomination. At first I felt like the Theory of Everything is one of those movies that is almost worthy of the nomination, but that it was only nominated since up to 10 movies can now be nominated for that Oscar. Now after looking at the list again and having seen all those films nominated for best picture, Theory of Everything triumphs over The Imitation Game, The Grand Budapest Hotel, and American Sniper - perhaps even Selma.I still think the two strongest films of the year were Birdman and Whiplash, but the acting in The Theory of Everything is phenomenal, especially Eddie Redmayne's performance as the brilliant yet handicapped Stephen Hawking. I felt guilty nearly giggling at Hawking's speech impediment when it is first introduced in the film, but shortly after realized it is how the physicist actually had to speak and that Redmayne must have a true gift to be able to recreate such a severe handicap.While I realize the purpose of this film was primarily the romance between Hawking and Jane, his wife who he eventually leaves, I would have liked to see more of Hawking's theory/work or at least see more into the theory with specific details. We have a film about one of the most intelligent people who ever lived, but the filmmakers wanted to dumb down Hawking's theory and his discoveries to 'benefit' the audience.I'm not sure how I would have liked to see the film end, but I thought it was strange to have Hawking acknowledge his wife and family so abruptly after leaving Jane towards the conclusion of the film. It is a sentimental moment, but it is brief and simple before a 'rewinding' sequence which looks back on the film (the lives of the two lovers) as a whole. A strong relationship story, but I would have liked to see more about the theory instead of that becoming disregarded for the sake of the love story.",8,0,2,12 July 2015
Room," One of the Best of the Year
","I want to start off by saying I recommend you do not watch the trailer for this film. If you do watch the trailer that's fine, but if you wish to avoid knowing what the 'second half' of this film is like then you should avoid it.That being said, in order to avoid commenting on the second half I am referring to, I'll try to talk about issues explored in the film rather than plot content.The basic premise is that a woman and her son live in a shed, which they refer to as simply 'Room,' years after the woman's abduction by an older man. Their names are Joy and Jack, and they are very codependent.What I did not expect from this film is that it deals with the theme of perception of reality, and how much the environment has an impact on this perception. Jack has only lived in Room his whole life and knows nothing outside of this life. To maintain his innocence, Joy has had to tell stories to build a certain perspective on reality for her son. One of the best scenes of the film is when Joy decides it is better for Jack to know the truth about the world and reality, and Jack's reaction is heartbreaking and played brilliantly by Jacob Tremblay.I want to say more, but I feel like I would give too much away if I did. In a nutshell, this film deals with issues I never would have imagined to be tackled in a film with this premise. I recommend you see this film unless you find the premise disturbing, though the film is never violent or graphic.3.5/4.0",9,2,11,20 November 2015
Dog Day Afternoon," A Great Realistic Look at Robbery
","After seeing it on the big screen for the first time, one thing I took away from the film when I reflected on it was that this film is similar to early Spielberg works in a way.What I mean by that is I read a book on interviews done with Spielberg, which touched on the idea that his early work revolved around stories where the media was involved somehow; the media looking at the event was an undertone of the film. In Dog Day Afternoon we get these aerial shots of Sonny outside the bank that captures what an event this was to the public - hundreds of extras as policemen, the media and the general public trying to catch a glimpse of the excitement of a bank robbery.Sonny even becomes an icon to the public when he says he doesn't want people killed, and gets people in an uproar when he reminds them of a similar situation in Attica (I believe) a short time ago. We see the people's reactions change as it is revealed that he has homosexual lover; some give him hate but he draws the attraction of the gay community.And these people aren't even inside with him as we are, missing out on how he acts in person. We see a performance by Pacino that cries out desperate and excitable in the best of ways. We see him stumble over problem after problem with the robbery, but he refuses to give up. He's a smart guy, having worked at a bank before, so it breaks him when his foolproof plan goes haywire in all sorts of directions.John Cazale is also in this film, and from what I have seen him in I say that he is a very underrated actor; without saying much in the film he has to pull of his character with subtleties, not exaggerations, and he does this very well. His best scene in the film is when he is being accused of being a hypocrite since he thinks the body should be protected since it is god's temple, yet he is in the process of robbing a bank.The film seems to drag at points with overly long sequences leading up to when transportation to an aircraft arrives for them. That doesn't mean these sequences lack content; there is a great moment when Sonny is making his will in case he dies before getting on a plane, but it feels like we wait half an hour between steps to his plan. Also, I was unimpressed by the actor who plays Sonny's lover.My friend pointed out that this film is somewhat anti-climactic but I didn't really think a big climax was necessary for this film, though I get his point. This is a great work of art that makes me want to watch more of Lumet's work in the near future, such as 12 Angry Men or Before the Devil Knows You're Dead.",9,0,1,28 February 2015
Ex Machina," Good Philosophy, but Predictable
","Ex Machina, like so many science-fiction movies before it, touches on the idea of what it means to be human, and where the line is drawn between human and artificial intelligence. While its aesthetic is solid, great general storytelling was lacking at certain points.The concept is interesting - it basically revolves around a novice programmer (Domhnall Gleeson) mistakenly falling for an android which possesses female characteristics. When we get deeper into what Nathan (Oscar Isaac) is really doing, the plot strays towards a revelation which I did not find too surprising. Not only is the revelation predictable, but it is not that interesting altogether because it strays from Nathan's supposed global ambitions to what feels to be personal insecurities.It seems strange to me that this film has a very claustrophobic feel to it since it takes place primarily in one location, which contradicts the fact that Nathan's experimenting will result in global benefits (not to mention he basically uses the world as a research method).What succeeded in the film was tackling the questions of artificial intelligence and whether or not it could ever have consciousness. Mad scientist Nathan is trying to build a being that can preserve itself, and the question on whether he is successful is indeed answered at the film's conclusion. It is also interesting that this film discusses thinking and the two programmers are practicing metacognition in the film - thinking about thinking. As far as the artificial intelligence goes, it is very thought-provoking to study towards the film's conclusion whether the character Ava should be considered a protagonist, an antagonist, or something completely different.This film held my interest, and while good philosophy was discussed from time to time in Ex Machina, it was not a very exciting film and multiple aspects of the film seemed a bit dull.2.5/4.0",7,0,1,30 August 2015
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Not a Fan of the Style, Still Enjoyable
","The Nightmare Before Christmas proves to be such a unique concept for a family movie. This fantasy story suggests that each holiday has a world of its own outside the boundaries of society, and two of those worlds collide in this movie: Halloweentown and Christmastown. The result creates an entertaining story of discovery and exploration.Meet Jack Skellington. Though he is not the mayor of Halloweentown, he has a huge influence over the inhabitants as he practically runs Halloween. Something is missing in his life though, and nobody can understand this except for Sally, a woman held together by stitches who is basically a slave to her creator. When Jack comes across Christmastown by mistake it gives him a sense of great wonder and hope. Sadly, when he tries to explain his feeling of warmth and happiness this world has created for him, the inhabitants of Halloweentown are only interested in whether the holiday Christmas has any scary aspects.The premise is very unique and sends a good message to children. However, while the story may be intriguing the dialogue seems to be simplified in order to target the attention span of children whereas good family films would challenge children to grasp dialogue with intentions that do not involve moving the plot forward or dialogue with vocabulary that is challenging to them. The way conversations or dialogue is handled in this film is slightly better than dialogue in The Polar Express (which isn't saying much).The art direction of the film is not for everyone, but while it is dark it is not creepy enough to scare children easily. Well, maybe very little children, but certain characters like Jack or the goofy mayor with two faces keep children distracted from the Gothic style of the movie.The best aspect of The Nightmare Before Christmas by far is the music. Each musical number is given great attention by Danny Elfman and the other writers and proves to be a very effective story- telling device within the film. If there's anything the audience will remember walking out of the film it would undoubtedly be either Jack's sad song about lacking meaning in his life, or the very upbeat and popular 'What's This?'This isn't your typical family film, but it has redeeming qualities and proves to be a very good musical.3.0/4.0",7,0,0,7 February 2016
Big Hero 6," Better than The Lego Movie? Than How To Train Your Dragon 2? Nope
","Congrats Academy, you chose the best animated picture of 2014 over 2 clearly better movies (The Lego Movie not even being nominated).With great recent movies like Wreck It Ralph and Frozen (people either love or hate the latter), Disney Animation produced a let- down film with Big Hero 6. It is an extremely simple film, cheesy at times, jokes that don't quite hit home - you know, typical Disney.While a shorter runtime usually condenses a movie into an acceptable story that is not too long, I feel like this film needed more content. I'm not sure what I would recommend for the story to extend it, but there are definitely parts of this film that are rushed. Take Callaghan's turn to evil - we learn that his daughter is the one who became a victim of an accident in a matter of seconds, forcing upon the audience the motivation for Callaghan's actions without much thought to it.I am not surprised this was not a great Disney Animation film since many of my friends were shocked that it took the Oscar over How to Train Your Dragon 2. I now understand the frustration. While enveloping us in a universe of awesome and easily adaptable technology, this movie falls just a little flat of wondrous.",7,0,1,12 July 2015
Dumb and Dumber," Simple Plot, Good Fun
","Especially from the title, going into this movie you have to expect a comedy that isn't smart, but isn't necessarily THAT stupid either. Obviously, a lot of the comedy comes from the two titular characters being dumb, acting like five-year-olds, but this doesn't take away from Carrey and Daniels' integrity - it takes talent to pull these characters off in a way that makes you enjoy yourself.As for the plot, it's so simple, yet little of the comedy within the movie revolves around the plot, but rather in episodes of Harry and Lloyd's stupidity. Lloyd and Harry lose their jobs, but Lloyd recovers a suitcase which Mary Swanson 'left behind' at the airport as she departed for Aspen. It turns out this suitcase holds ransom for her husband, and two hit men follow Lloyd as he and Harry travel to Aspen to recover the ransom, thinking the two of them are masterminds (a big laugh).To give you an idea about the comedy in this film here are some examples - Lloyd knows 'the most annoying sound in the world,' Harry has to ask if BOTH skis belong to a woman he meets, a police officer drinks from a beer bottle which Lloyd has urinated in, and the list goes on like that.If you allow yourself to not expect greatness from this film, you will probably find yourself enjoying it. It is a good comedy that features one of Jim Carrey's best characters to date.3.0/4.0",7,0,0,9 August 2015
The Imitation Game," Good, but Not Oscar Worthy
","This movie intrigued more than I initially thought it would. It is intriguing, but it is simultaneously pretty formulaic - I am not sure it really deserved its win for Best Adapted Screenplay, but I didn't hate the film.At the soul of the movie we have a great performance by Benedict Cumberbatch, though at first he seems to borrow from his Sherlock persona in order to come across as a jerk or misunderstood man whom nobody likes. We also learn through flashbacks that he is weak- willed since he was bullied as a child, he doesn't believe in violence due to this, and that he is gay, and was fond of a childhood friend of his. Some of these flashbacks really depict Turin's back story, but some seem unnecessary to be honest.Back to Cumberbatch's performance, he depicts being misunderstood and weak-willed very well, but towards the conclusion of this film when he is struggling with hormonal therapy it seems like a bit of a stretch. In fact, he seems to be at his best and his worst when he shows an obsessive attachment to Christopher (an obvious metaphor) before the last minutes of the movie.The film is filled with cheesy situations/moments which brings its Oscar potential down and makes it much less of an adult film than it could have been. The scene where Mark Strong says he has known about the spy all along, the scene with one of Turin's crew saying his brother was on a ship, the caption at the end that reads 'today they are called computers...'This film still intrigued me though it was formulaic. I am fine with cinema depicting homosexuality as a struggle in films like Brokeback Mountain or Milk, but even though it was a main point in this film the scenes reflecting on Turin's homosexuality (minus some good flashbacks) seemed to be over-dramatized.",6,0,1,1 April 2015
The Evil Dead," Neither That Scary nor Bad Enough to Make Fun Of
","I wish I hadn't heard this since I like to go into films without expectations, but right before the movie played in class my buddy talked it up as a really campy film that I would enjoy. Yes there were cheesy and flat-out stupid lines in the film that I laughed at, but these were mainly at the beginning. Also, according to my professor this was supposed to be gut-wrenching scary, but I was ultimately unimpressed with the horror aspects of the movie.Apparently this title has a rating of NC-17 because of the horror/gore aspects of the film, but I didn't find these elements to be even remotely scary - though I could see how they would be frightening in an early 80s movie. For me, though, when the teens were infected by the spirits, they looked exactly how I expected the un-dead in early 80s movies to look, if not even worse since they had strange tints to their skin. Also, in the second half of the film, there are moments when the spirits just kind of decide to make the infected appear normal for a minute just to fool the main character. So, the un-dead are only un-dead when they choose to be?I think if there were more funny moments (whether intentionally or unintentionally funny) it would have made the film more enjoyable since I expected to see something very campy, but this was just a plain bad horror film, though nowhere near as bad as Night of the Living Dead. In fact, when I watched Night of the Living Dead it broke so many continuity rules and had so many cheesy parts that I was laughing throughout the film. I guess something like that experience is what I expected, but to me this was just a standard horror film with a low budget.",5,0,5,1 April 2015
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Tarantino's Return to Violence
","I have been watching Tarantino's films in chronological order by release date in preparation for The Hateful Eight. After the intricate drama which was Jackie Brown, Tarantino returns to the use of violence with Kill Bill Vol. 1, and he adds so much more violence to the film than any of his previous 3. We have Kill Bill Vol. 1 using violence as a spectacle in many ways, especially in the climactic 'chapter' of the film.Like Jackie Brown, Tarantino decides to go with a female protagonist to portray the powerful woman in modern society. Feminism is a large motif in the first part of the whole bloody affair. Yes, The Bride fights men in this film, but the film's main antagonists are strong women who have worked alongside The Bride in the past. The battles are no longer fought by men, guys; the women in this film put men in their place as they are intelligent, maniacal, but above all, simply bad-a**es.Whereas Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown were more 'intelligent' films, this one is probably one of the most fun Tarantino movies to watch. It also has a simple premise/motivation which we have seen often before: revenge. But revenge has never been done quite like this. The blood effects in this film are ridiculous beyond any form of rationality, making certain deaths gruesome but at the same time, somewhat pleasing in a twisted fashion. Not only is anime employed to highlight the background of Lucy Liu's character - Tarantino gets away with huge uses of blood in a more 'appropriate' manner than if he were to form these scenes as live action segments. It also adds to the idea that the movie is supposed to be fun and cartoonish.Whereas I have discussed that Tarantino uses dialogue in his first three films to build characters, there is not much 'interesting' dialogue in this film as much as narrations by The Bride, but this film doesn't seem to need the witty, clever dialogue we are so used to in Quentin Tarantino films.With an astounding cliffhanger of an ending, this film makes you crave for more as the credits roll. This is a fun piece of feminist film to say the least, even if the film is desperate for flashbacks and narration at certain moments.3.5/4.0",9,0,2,4 December 2015
Jerry Maguire," Very Easy to Watch
","Jerry Maguire is not a perfect movie in the sense that it is a masterpiece, but it seems difficult to dislike this movie. Despite being rated R for some swearing and sexual content, this movie deals with the notion of family and is definitely easy enough for a child to watch. It is very entertaining while it is simultaneously a touching story about relationships and their importance in our lives.More than anything, Jerry Maguire is a film with heart. It can be argued that it has two protagonists: Jerry and Rod (played by Cuba Gooding Jr.) and both seem to need to learn about love. Jerry needs to connect to people, specifically to those who he claims to love, and Cuba needs to learn to play his sport with love and not just for the money. It is brilliant in the sense that Maguire's story and Rod's story are intertwined since the two depend on each other. Maguire is all about making relationships with clients more personal while Rod is all about wanting Jerry to pay attention to his needs. One is the professional, the other is the greedy showboat. Ultimately, they both depend on each other since Rod is Jerry's last client and since Jerry might be the only agent willing to put up with Rod's ego.The film is well-acted, especially by Cuba Gooding Jr., and we like each character for different reasons. The kids in this film are adorable, especially Ray, Dorothy's son, who proves to be funny even though we know he is the reason Jerry wants to get together with Dorothy.Half a sports film and half a romance, Jerry Maguire proves to be fun for a variety of people.3.5/4.0",9,0,0,6 February 2016
Jurassic World," All Over the Place
","The four writers of Jurassic World didn't seem to be sure what they wanted their film to be - therein might lie the problem with collaborative writing. Collaborative writing is not always a problem - there were multiple writers on great films such as Toy Story and Children of Men, but after seeing the final cut of Jurassic World I wonder if the writers each wanted something different for the film to say.We start the film with two brothers who will be traveling to Jurassic World, the younger one more excited, the other one a young high-schooler more concerned about leaving his girlfriend even though he won't tell her he loves her when she says it to him. This older brother, Zach, is a pretty boring character who merely stares at girls at the theme park, but not necessarily in a creepy way since they smile at him. And his girlfriend is hardly ever brought up again; what a jerk. The younger one, Gray (I thought his name was Greg), is a dinosaur enthusiast who is constantly running to get to the next attraction in a hurry. Sending two kids to a dinosaur theme park seems like a bad idea - no matter how 'safe' it is - but when they get there it is revealed they will have an adult chaperone, but they run away from her at one point, of course.So the movie suggests we will follow these two kids on their exciting journey, then introduces a handful of other 'main' characters. There is the Chris Pratt character, who personifies animal activism in this film, 'Aunt Claire,' who is a workaholic who works behind the scenes at Jurassic World, and does not have time for her two nephews - the boys mentioned earlier - and a security guy who is interested and obsessed with using Chris Pratt's raptors as weapons.If that wasn't enough, the main plot takes on a Godzilla-esque story (if Godzilla were a villain like in the '98 version) focusing on an alpha dinosaur who is virtually unstoppable, and escapes captivity through employing great intelligence and goes on a rampage across the park. You would think security would shut the park down immediately, but no - this is also a movie which questions the relationship between commercialism and safety, and the park's owner says security should be able to handle these types of problems without inducing fear in the park-goers.Without even getting into the second act of the film, this is already a mess, and if that wasn't enough, the film is filled with terribly cheesy comedic bits which feel extremely out of place for a sequel to a Spielberg classic. These moments feel more awkward than funny, and they drag the movie down with them.Jurassic World is mildly entertaining, but lacks the sense of wonder and awe present in the first film in my opinion, though it does contain some good moments of suspense. This is a decent popcorn movie, but its overload of various themes and subplots make it sloppy.",5,7,17,12 June 2015
Mission: Impossible II," At Least It's Less Pretentious
","One thing I couldn't stand about the first Mission: Impossible is how it was trying to seem really complex - especially with the motif of the bible verse and how Ethan Hunt inexplicably knew how to contact his enemy - when it was really just a simple action film. This film is simple and knows it, making it easier to just enjoy for the ride. Sometimes simplicity (at least in plot) is just more fitting, and I think it is the case for this franchise of movies.The plot is literally just what the plot section on this movie's IMDb page says, so there you have it. Once you get past that you can enjoy the film.As in the first film, I'm not sure how the filmmakers pull off the sequences involving the elaborate masks, but it is a pretty brilliant effect whether it is CGI (when they remove the mask) or if it is an actual mask - it is so hard to tell. One plot hole though for this movie: how do the enemies have the exact same elaborate- mask-making technology as the spy agency which Ethan Hunt works for?I find this film a little more fun than the first, but it is also filled with more clichés in my opinion. We have a woman on Hunt's side acting as a double agent to gain the villain's trust, we have villains who want to create an epidemic for profit (granted I don't know when this story element originated) and there is almost too much slow motion used in this movie - and it's the type where they didn't even to bother trying to put it into 24fps as modern slow- motion works in film.An okay action film just barely better than the first, which doesn't say much. I hope I'll enjoy 3 and 4 more when I rewatch them - I had never seen numbers 1 and 2 before, strange I know.",7,1,1,30 July 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Very Exciting and Fun
","I was worried when I heard some critics were giving Age of Ultron worse reviews than the first movie, but I didn't really research what this meant exactly: whether it meant Age of Ultron would be terrible or just not as good. I try to avoid reviews so I can make my own opinion about the movie, and I have to say I really loved this movie. There are many great aspects to this film, including how it lived up to the fun of the first movie while establishing a darker tone at points (I love dark stories).Age of Ultron doesn't mess around, and we are immediately immersed in an action scene at the opening to the film. And immediately we get a joke: the first line uttered is 's***!' by Tony Stark, to which Rodgers yells 'language,' and this becomes a moment the film keeps coming back to. I am not going to give anything away for these parts, but the parts I enjoyed the most involved Thor's hammer; so funny. Robert Downey Jr is at the heart of the fun in this movie, being the smart-ass that is my favorite character of the bunch, but he is also one of the most tested characters in this movie which I love.Tony attempts to put a shield around the world, as he states, by creating Ultron, a digital consciousness that can connect to just about anywhere in the world, allowing it to control a countless number of androids. This is a result of his seeing a vision, due to Scarlet Witch's magic, of the Avengers defeated, making Tony fear what lies beyond the planet after their fight with Loki. The creation of Ultron makes the some of the other Avengers fearful when Tony wants to upload another digital consciousness into a body Ultron was going to upload himself into. The scene that results from this reignites the film after a slow second act in my opinion.Not wanting to reveal anymore about the excitement of this film, this is where I leave you. I highly recommend this film; if you like action films or specifically superhero films you will not be disappointed with this one.",9,1,6,17 May 2015
2001: A Space Odyssey," Ambiguity Doesn't mean Greatness
","Don't get me wrong, 2001 is a good movie, but in my opinion a lot of philosophical 'content' doesn't mean a film is a masterpiece.I actually believe the film lacks content. In the penultimate sequence of this film, Dave travels through hyperspace which makes for some very cool visuals. But that seems to be the purpose behind it: just to portray space in a visually stunning way.Let's go back to earlier in the film. The sequence with the apes discovering the monolith is amazing, and sets the tone for looking at the monolith in relation to using tools and the progression of technology. At the monolith's third appearance the 'progression' seems to be of Dave becoming a star child. Is that a progression of technology? Is it a progression of mankind? I mean, I guess those are the questions we are meant to ask at the conclusion, but does ambiguity really mean greatness? Even if these questions are answered, I don't really see the significance of these answers.Also, the film is structured in a way that doesn't really get resolved - at least on the A plot line. In middle of the film, Dave and his partners are on a mission to Jupiter, and they never even get there; Dave is the only one left and happens to travel into a wormhole of sorts. By the way, before coming the star child, where is David? What is this room and how did he get here? I don't get why these questions get ignored, just because the film is supposed to be philosophical?This is a good film with great ambition, but I don't see it as one of the most important films of all time.I think the best aspect of this film is Hal-9000.",7,0,4,21 March 2015
Singin' in the Rain," Fantastic Musical, But Not The Greatest
","You wouldn't normally expect greatness from a huge meta-film like this one; a movie about making movies seems self-indulgent. However, this film is not full of itself with the fact that it is about movies - it even addresses problems that sound provided in the early years of sound's use in the motion pictures. It seems that this reflection on cinema's early days of sound may be the reason it is considered one of the greatest movies ever made, though I disagree with this idea. While this is considered the greatest musical film of all time, I'd have to say Yankee Doodle Dandy definitely tops this one.What is great about the story of this musical is it is easy enough for anybody to follow, which makes me think that this might be one of the first movies I show my children if I ever have any. The antagonist - Lina Lamont - isn't evil enough to crush a child's innocence, but a child would understand to dislike her while laughing at her ridiculous voice, making her not so ruthless of a villain.This film has an interesting take on many aspects of Hollywood. It doesn't state whether or not we should consider film to be a high art since there is much commentary (especially at the beginning) on theatrical actors giving more input into their performances than silly faces projected on a screen. Also, the various numbers in the film are filmed with long takes, making it seem more like a theatrical musical than a film (with exceptions to the incredibly- filmed sequences 'Beautiful Girls' and 'Broadway Melody'). Since it is hard to tell where the theater ends and the film begins, the film doesn't give one specific stance of film as an art but rather different points of view on the matter. I suppose this may be why the film is considered to be among the greatest movies ever, but as I have said in past reviews, ambiguity does not necessarily mean greatness. It has to be pulled off right in my opinion. I am not saying the movie is less than good, it is great! But is it really this masterpiece everybody says it is? It is a formulaic musical where the central couple ends up together at the conclusion as expected by the audience. Yes it has entertaining numbers such as 'Make 'Em Laugh,' but do such numbers make this a masterpiece? This is a great film to watch with highly entertaining moments, but a self-indulgent film shouldn't automatically dictate greatness - stories about more 'everyday' situations are much more powerful. Not all of us know the Hollywood life.3.5/4.0",9,1,3,18 September 2015
Avatar," It's Not the Ripping Off - It's the Dialogue
","Avatar had a lot of potential to be amazing. It is still very good, but many argue against it since it ripped off Pocahontas/Dances With Wolves. Plots from previous movies or stories have been used and re- used over and over again and we don't complain about many of them being ripped off. Shakespeare has been redone countless times and there is something new with each retelling of his work. With the retelling of Dances With Wolves via Avatar we have a Dances With Wolves for a new generation. Unfortunately, some of the dialogue and plot points are terrible, but shut your brain off and it's a fun experience.Let's look at the world of Avatar. It's a moon of a planet in another galaxy that seems to bring our fantasies to life with foreign lifeforms beyond our imaginations - monkeys with four arms, crossbreed lifeforms that seem to combine horses with zebras, giant flying creatures that we could probably only compare to pterodactyls, and the list goes on. The plants in this universe are strange and beautiful in their own way as well. Everything on the moon seems to have a blue or green tint to it, practically force- feeding the audience the idea that this world is supposed to represent a sort of Eden. The most notable factor of this world is the human-like creatures labeled as the Na'vi can literally connect with many of the animals as well as their sacred tree through a link that ironically resembles the way digital technologies connect in this day and age. Such a world and the connection between the natives and nature preach heavily for environmentalist movements. Finally, we have to remember this world was created with digital rendering, and the world is nothing short of beautiful.Disregarding the elaborate world-building involved in this film, the movie is filled with clichés, cheesy dialogue, and one-dimensional characters. Let's look at various ridiculous aspects of Avatar. The name of the mineral the United States businessman (played by Ribisi) is looking for is Unobtainium. Surprisingly, that is not a joke. The head of the military sanction is a one-dimensional character set out only on destroying the Na'vi since they're 'savages' (according to his cheesy monologue at the start of the movie) and so that his superiors can get their hands on the Unobtainium. He trusts Sully and believes he will report to him since he used to be a marine and makes a promise to get him his real legs back - that is before his use of the Avatar allows him to enjoy running again. Dialogue coming from this character as well as from Sully and even Sigourney Weaver's character are laughable at moments, making us ask why Cameron didn't consult many co-writers.What this movie lacks for in quality of writing, however, it makes up with heart. The ideals the Na'vi strive for seem like they have been forgotten in the real world today, and they are what draw us and Sully to them as a community. We cheer for Sully and the Na'vi in the climactic battle within the film which lives up to other great action sequences in recent years even if most of it is CGI, though this film requires heavy use of CGI throughout, so why would the action be any different?Avatar is good; it cannot be labeled terrible simply because it takes plot points from Dances With Wolves, but it does lack quality based on its disregard for good dialogue and some underdeveloped characters.3.0/4.0",8,3,4,16 March 2016
Selma," This Wasn't Quite Oscar Material
","People were upset at the 2015 Oscars that this movie didn't get recognition in certain categories, making it seem as if the Academy was discriminating. I disagree with this disappointment as I didn't see greatness in this movie.Selma was a slow movie for me, but it had a lot of allusions and historical figures to make for a good movie for history buffs. The movie had an aura of significance throughout, but it wasn't necessarily intriguing to me. The film's focus is on a short segment of Martin Luther King Jr.'s life, specifically the march from Selma to Montgomery (I believe) to protest the suppression of African Americans' right to vote.The film was only mediocre. Firstly, I did not think David Oyelowo played a good MLK Jr. Secondly the film seemed to rush through interactions with historical figures instead of keeping them on for the ride. When they show Malcolm X in the film he is pronounced dead only a few scenes later. J. Edgar Hoover shows up once in the film even though he is mentioned on a few occasions.Nothing stood out for me regarding the overall aesthetic of the film which is why I call Selma mediocre at best. Everything seemed pretty typical - the direction, the cinematography, the editing had a slow pace to it, the acting - all fairly typical. With a boring movie I really don't have much to say, and this film bored me, but it was historically significant and still relevant to recent African American issues such as the riots in Ferguson.",6,0,0,4 June 2015
Grindhouse," Decent Effort by Rodriguez and Tarantino
","Grindhouse is a rare experience since double features are not regularly made nowadays. The style that was put into making this double feature particularly makes it feel like two older movies (perhaps from the 70s) but with contemporary actors we know and love like Bruce Willis, Josh Brolin, and Rosario Dawson to name a few. Together, Planet Terror and Death Proof bring an interesting experience to viewers. Separately, each is a good (but not great) B movie.What worked for Planet Terror: it is awesome as a 'disease' or 'outbreak' movie. Even though the film is generally darkly lit, the killing of the infected proves to be action-packed and very bloody (did Tarantino ghost direct certain parts)? Wray is a really cool character with a clear expertise on guns and a great shooter. Cherry is good as well, but a little more bland than Wray. While the coolest aspect of the film has to be when Cherry gains a gun for a leg it defies the logic of her knowing how to operate it without pulling a trigger of any sorts. Also, it does not seem to run out of ammo. But this logic is somewhat irrelevant since it is clear Planet Terror was made for fun.What worked for Death Proof: Tarantino is at it again with conversations that connect dots between various situations. For example, in the first half of the film a girl is told to do a lap- dance for the first man who says something specific to her, and her friends urge her not to be 'chickens***.' When Kurt Russell tries this on this same girl later in the film, he makes an analogy to the common phrase 'in my book' and threatens to put this girl under 'chickens***' in his 'book.' Unlike most Tarantino movies, however, it lacks substance, and at its most basic, Death Proof is about Kurt Russell tracking two sets of girls - one in the first half and another in the second half. Even with Tarantino-esque dialogue, this segment falls short of great, but Kurt Russell's performance in this movie is convincing and impressive.It is a fun experience to watch this double feature, but do not expect to watch two masterpieces by any means.3.0/4.0",8,1,2,26 February 2016
Mission: Impossible," A Decent Action Film
","To me a film becomes boring if it becomes predictable - especially if what was predictable was supposed to be a huge twist for the film. Even though I sometimes write spoilers I'm not going to spoil who the villain of the film is (I knew in the first 15 minutes of the film) but that doesn't really matter since it is so easy to figure out.I noticed that this film set a lot of precedents for action films made after this film. For example, if you have seen the first Spider-man film with Tobey Maguire then you probably remember the scene where Peter's single drop of blood signals Osbourne to become suspicious of his environment, and it is a very tense, simple scene. Well, in Mission: Impossible, Tom Cruise is breaking into a room which will sound an alarm if the tiniest amount of weight is added to the room, even a drop of water, and Cruise starts sweating, and the scene becomes tense when a single drop of sweat is about to fall from the glasses he is wearing.This movie seems to think it is being overly smart which gets annoying when you realize the story is pretty simple. Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is on a mission at the start of the movie that goes haywire and results in the death of most of his team members. Somebody who is higher up than Hunt in this business calls him to a meeting immediately, where Hunt learns they think he is a traitor, so he has been set up. The plot then focuses on Hunt trying to contact the actual mole in the agency by referencing a specific bible verse from the book of Job (something was mentioned about a 'job' in his initial meeting with the executive) and in my mind it is kind of confusing how he knows exactly what to say and who to e-mail to try to find the mole. It becomes like speaking in riddles and I do not think the movie needed to be this 'smart' when its purpose was to be a fun action movie.Towards the end of the film, the CGI is just plain terrible in the climactic action sequence. Not to say that the action itself is not fun, but it just breaks the illusion of the film and you realize you're watching a movie (a movie should allow you to get lost in it). This is especially noticeable when Cruise's character flies towards the camera at one point, and you notice that the Cruise coming at you is computer generated for two thirds of the jump. The one effect I was astounded by, however, was the use of masks in the film - I'm not sure if the masks were real masks, but damn, they were elaborate masks that copied exactly how other characters in the movie looked, and I have to say bravo.I didn't enjoy this action movie since it wasn't as fun for me as other action movies, but perhaps this is your type of action movie; who am I to say?",7,0,0,5 July 2015
Reservoir Dogs," What a Debut
","It's very rare that we see a director establish him- or herself as a true talent with their first theatrical release. Not only did Tarantino establish himself as a great storyteller with the release of Reservoir Dogs, he also gave us a glimpse of his distinct artistic voice that we would anticipate in the years to come. He specifically set a trend in the use of dialogue which reminds us of everyday conversations yet is simultaneously layered with subtext and analogies.The opening sequence establishes Tarantino's master of dialogue perfectly. While the conventional director might open a robbery film with a scene which highlights the plan for the robbery, Tarantino strays away from exposition. Instead, we get a lengthy conversation in which the robbers analyze a song, discuss the ethics of tipping waitresses, and make pop culture references. What does this do? It establishes the characters as human beings and gives them life instead of having the boss merely explain the plot to the robbers, who would substitute for the audience.This might have to do entirely with the fact that the film had a low budget, but Tarantino essentially uses one location for about two thirds of the film. He is still able to establish an intricate and very tense story revolving around the idea that one of the robbers suspects an undercover cop is amongst them. The set design is simple - an abandoned warehouse - so the visual creativity of the film is mostly in the cinematography, but even with that, the heavy use of the warehouse as a setting makes this come across as more of a play, which it should. The dialogue is the driving force of this film, and while the characters may discuss plot at points (I hate it when movies rely on explanations of the plot through dialogue, a la Inception) it is only done when it is necessary. The rest of the dialogue reveals much more about the characters than visuals could provide in this film, and hey, I'm okay with that.One problem I have with the film is the fact that while this film revolves around a group of robbers we never learn too much about two of the robbers since they are hardly in the movie. In fact, one of them only has a few lines in the opening conversation scene of the film. The absence of that character would hardly change the meaning of the film at all, which is why I wish we would have gotten to know him a bit more. I understand side characters, but in a film about a group of robbers, the entire group should have a significant part in the film as an ensemble cast.A great directorial debut for Quentin Tarantino, Reservoir Dogs shines as a surprising hit for a crime film with such a low budget and as a huge influence on the manner of dialogue used in crime films between its release and present day.4.0/4.0",10,0,0,15 November 2015
Pulp Fiction," Redefining the Episodic Film
","This film may play with its use of chronology, and it may be episodic, but people generally claim this movie to be great because it is the first to do so. It is certainly not the first film to do either of these things. It is inspired by many films before it, such as Rashomon - which tells the same story from four different perspectives - as well as 'My Life to Live,' a neorealist film which is told in twelve distinct episodes. However, Pulp Fiction was the first film to play with chronology in this manner in many years, and it is because it does so with great purpose which helps to make it my favorite movie (among various other reasons).Some complain about this fiddling with chronology to cause confusion, yet the story only goes out of the linear time line in two spots in the film, and I always found it easy to follow. As for the BIG episodes in the film (the ones Tarantino actually gave titles to) the first two are played in chronological order, and the third episode shown jumps back to a spot before the other two stories. I will not got too in depth with my next comment as it would give too much away if I did, but Tarantino's choice to show Butch Coolidge's story (Bruce Willis) before Jules' story (Samuel L Jackson) has a huge impact on the way the audience views Vincent Vega (John Travolta) by the end of the film. It is this fact combined with the way Jules' story ends that left me mind-blown when I watched this film for the first time.I understand that in the context of 1994 when this film was released that it was an extremely violent film. If you're still going to complain about the violence in this film today, I would laugh and tell you there is no way you could handle more contemporary films like Mongol, 300, or Gone Girl. Hell, I hope you can make it through Django Unchained, Tarantino's most recent and by far his most violent film to date. What people forget to say about the violence in Pulp Fiction is that most of it actually happens off screen, leaving the violence up to the audience's imagination (maybe this is why people remember it to be more violent than it actually is).What I realized and loved about this film after watching it for a few times is that the three stories of this film all have a common connection - they deal with loyalty to a father figure, each one more intimate than the last. We have Vincent Vega struggling to be loyal to Marsellus Wallace (the crime boss), we have Butch Coolidge honoring his father, and we have Jules Winnfield rethinking his relationship with God.Other than the chronology of the film, what is easily the most notable thing about Pulp Fiction is the dialogue. Tarantino has arguably written better scenes after this film (in fact, I agree with his choice of the opening scene of Inglourious Basterds as his favorite thing he has written), but this is the movie by Tarantino that EVERYBODY quotes, especially the famous scene when Jules dominates the conversation about breakfast and what Marsellus Wallace looks like (trust me, even if you haven't seen the movie you've probably heard a friend quoting this scene). Tarantino is a master of dialogue - he writes conversations that people might actually have with each other. The topics may seem random, but that's how real-world conversations work. You discuss events, make analogies, disagree and argue - you don't simply talk about what is going to happen or what has happened, which is unfortunately how a lot of dialogue in film goes. Tarantino always creates distinct and well-developed characters through his use of dialogue.This movie is a roller coaster of an experience, and it gets my highest rating.4.0/4.0",10,4,9,23 November 2015
The Departed," A Great Addition to an Amazing Filmography
","Any film student or film aficionado can tell you the man behind such iconic movies as Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, and Raging Bull: Martin Scorsese. Scorsese may often work with the same actors and direct stories around criminal life, but there is not a specific distinct style when it comes to his films as you would find with directors such as Tim Burton, John Carpenter, or Christopher Nolan. I mean, how can you compare Hugo to Casino stylistically? What IS behind a lot of Scorsese's films is great storytelling, and The Departed is no different. Though Scorsese deserved an Oscar long before 2007, The Departed lives among some of his greatest work.While it may not be a very diverse ensemble, the cast in this film is simply phenomenal. It consists of iconic white male actors both old and young pulling off their roles as cops and gang members perfectly, and Vera Farmiga doing a 'good enough' job as a therapist for young cops and undercover workers. While Mark Wahlberg earned himself a deserving nomination for best supporting actor, the actor who steals the show is Leonardo DiCaprio, who probably would have also received a nomination if he had not worked on Blood Diamond the same exact year. We don't know whether to be terrified of Costello (Jack Nicholson) or if we should nervously giggle at his dark sense of humor, Alec Baldwin is at his A-game as an excitable investigator, Matt Damon is Boston personified, and Martin Sheen reminds us why he shouldn't be associated with Charlie Sheen in this day and age. Phenomenal work all around, and one last note is as odd as this may sound, Mark Wahlberg excels at swearing in this film. Funny s***.Based on the foreign script 'Infernal Affairs' (which this critic is eager to watch) The Departed is unsubtle in its focus on 'rats,' double agents both in the Irish mafia of Boston as well as the state police force. Matt Damon is a man who was practically raised by Frank Costello to become a rat within the state police while Leonardo DiCaprio plays a young man who grew up in a notorious family who wants to turn his life around by becoming a true cop. Nobody would believe him in a uniform, so Sheen and Wahlberg ask him to gain Costello's trust and he becomes a rat within Costello's gang.Morality is what is at stake in The Departed. The morality of lying is the most notable since the film is focused on double agents, but even the love triangle developed between Damon, DiCaprio, and Farmiga brings this into question. DiCaprio tries to get under Farmiga's skin at first asking if she lies in general, and as she gets closer to him she confesses that she would lie if her boyfriend (Damon) saw her together with DiCaprio. As we realize that Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio are not the only 'rats' in the story, it brings not only the morality of lying into question, but also it calls for the audience to ask how we can determine who is on which side of the law. Is there a line? Is the law black and white? Or are there exceptions when it comes to double agents?While the narrative is amazing, it is important to note that this film is littered with swearing and violence, so keep that in mind if you're sensitive to these issues or if you are considering letting a child view this movie. Regarding these same issues, do NOT watch this film on cable TV as it is censored to the point where the dialogue becomes ridiculous and you cannot take the film seriously. Other than that, this film should one day become a required screening in college level film courses; a true masterpiece.4.0/4.0",10,1,2,16 March 2016
The Witch," More Disturbing than 'Scary'
","What a good directorial debut. The Witch is a solid film by Robert Eggers. Set in colonial times in America, the story is one of a family that is exiled from a village. The family chooses to settle near the woods in which many strange things occur, the first being the disappearance of the baby of the family.The eldest daughter of the family is cautious when it comes to the woods, but that doesn't mean she can't get good fun out of teasing her little sister that she is the infamous witch of the woods. This little sister and her twin brother take this jest too seriously, and eventually inform their parents of this incident. That being said, supernatural forces are at play among the family at the core of the movie, and tensions are raised and the family members are against each other as possible demons.Some may find trouble keeping up with the Old English used in the film, but it seems easy enough to understand when you compare it to Shakespeare's works (even with modern adaptations such as Whedon's 'Much Ado About Nothing'). The person who uses this type of the language the most is the father, William, played by Ralph Ineson. Ineson steals the show even when the audience cannot fully comprehend what he is saying (it is easy to get the general idea though). His performance is probably one of the best aspects of this film, other than the lack of great color variety that truly sets the mood for this film.In terms of 'horror' films, this movie does not produce many jump scares, and is instead just disturbing in content, making it comparable to films like The Shining or perhaps Rosemary's Baby. With the family accusing each other, elements of The Thing also come into play. A solid film when it comes to technicality and the horror genre in general, but it could have used a bit more story and more clarification about the demons at play in this film.3.0/4.0",8,18,39,1 March 2016
A Hard Day's Night," Reminiscent of The Marx Brothers
","A Hard Day's Night packs a lot of fun into a movie. Some critics say this film is part documentary, to which I saw just because the famous group plays themselves doesn't make A Hard Day's Night a documentary. It is a quirky comedy and a musical that tries to capture the essence of The Beatles, one of the most influential bands in history.It is enjoyable how many comedic bits this movie is made of. Although it is definitely not the same type of humor throughout the film, some of it seems to pay homage to the Marx brothers. The comedy is all situational or dialogue-based, but none of it seems to be slapstick humor which comes into play only a few times in Marx brothers films. Though you don't find the urge to laugh at it, the first conversation of the film is amusing; Paul McCartney insists the man they sit with on a train is his grandfather, explaining 'I'm entitled to two, aren't I' when the other Beatles insist they have seen his grandfather before. It is also amusing when the Beatles never seem to react much to things their managers get into a fuss over.Although it touches on it only in a few parts, this movie also has great commentary on social class. A few minutes into the film, an older gentleman of the upper class shares the train carriage with the Beatles and he is immediately snobby to fit the conditions to his needs, which means the Beatles can't have the window open or listen to their radio. Then, inexplicably, The Beatles are running beside the train asking for their ball back, a great analogy of the situation.Obviously the music in the film must be given thought to as well. The music is simply there when it is used and does not really contribute much to the story. However, the energy of the Beatles is captured with the opening credit sequence in which A Hard Day's Night is playing as well as in a scene with Can't Buy me Love when the four Beatles run around a field with a helipad to escape their 'imprisonment due to fame' if only for a brief moment. Some of the music is just there, and some of it conveys energy.The story is definitely not the highlight of the film. It is reflective of the Beatles' life as a band - the reason some may consider it a documentary - but it truly is not a documentary in any sense. It is a fictional story constructed around the idea that the band has an important performance to give. Don't set expectations high for a great story here because it is very straightforward.A Hard Day's Night still has a good sense of energy and a lot of comedy, making this 'Beatles movie' a delight to watch.3.0/4.0",8,0,1,12 February 2016
Edge of Tomorrow," I Unexpectedly Loved this Movie
","What a way to end a semester of good science fiction by watching Edge of Tomorrow. I remember seeing the trailer for this film during a Godzilla IMAX 3D screening, thinking it looked too much like a video game and that it looked so cliché. I didn't grasp the fact that it was like Groundhog Day meets Terminator, and the result was a great deal of fun.First of all, this film has a good casting of leads/important characters, such as Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt (who I had not seen much of before this film) and Brendan Gleeson (who I LOVE in In Bruges). Some people hate Tom Cruise, and to that I say give the guy a chance with great roles under his belt such as the lead in Rain Man and a role in Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia which rightfully earned him an Oscar nomination. Emily Blunt is amazing as the 'full metal b****' who does not give a damn, knocking out a soldier who nearly calls her by this name. And as for Gleeson, I guess he doesn't really do much, but I like him.Going back to Tom Cruise, he plays an iconic spokesperson who has a high military rank, though he is more involved with advertising and wants little to do with actual battle. He is a coward who is sent on a journey to prove himself to be a very brave soldier.The Groundhog Day aspect to this film provides a lot of laughs, focusing on funny ways that he dies early in the film and the way Emily Blunt's character kills him over and over again.The premise of the film is kind of a stretch to believe, but then again this is science fiction; you either buy it or you don't. Cage is lucky enough to kill an 'Alpha' with a claymore before dying, and the alpha's blood is splattered onto him and gives him the 'ability' to reset the day as he dies. These aliens are unlike any we have seen before in alien invasion movies, looking like giant sea creatures with a type of 'hair' that looks like the features of an anemone. Alphas are very rare amongst them, which are the ones that can reset the day, and their motivations are unknown, but they are a force that the world is fighting against. This is a very 'us vs them' film promoting global unity to fight a threat.You'll be pleasantly surprised with this gem; watch this film.",9,0,2,17 May 2015
Downfall," Short of Greatness
","Downfall is very good, but it wasn't great as I expected it to be, especially with all the hype it gets on IMDb. We have a unique look at WWII, seeing it through Hitler's eyes and being more about Hitler losing than the Allies winning as many WWII films do.I don't know much about the 2005 Oscars from memory, but Bruno Ganz played Hitler so well he should have received an Oscar nomination if he did not. If they can give an Oscar to Marion Cotillard for playing Edith Piaf in a foreign film then they can certainly at least nominate Bruno Ganz for this performance in a foreign film. Hitler's brutality came across clearly with Ganz's various tempter tantrums he had to exhibit, while maintaining the integrity of Hitler as a leader, being a quiet and polite (yet mentally ill) man when all is well, doing what he believes is best for his country in the moment. It may seem weird that I'm practically sympathizing for Hitler, but the film portrays him as a caring individual; it is scary and strange at the same time.I know the title is 'Downfall,' so it deals with the OVERALL downfall of Germany in WWII, but there's something not right with killing Hitler 2/3 of the way through the film. I know this film accurately portrays what happened, but there's just something not right having Hitler's death be well before the conclusion of the film. If anything, this was kind of an early climax of the film, with about 40 minutes of falling action/resolution.While this movie may have made me sympathize for Hitler, it made me sympathize with other Nazi's (or some children) even more since many Nazi soldiers promised Hitler they would commit suicide, and the children of Goebbels are killed in their sleep by their mother - very chilling scene.Finally, I understand the point of endings of 'true stories' where they give you information through text describing how people turned out later, but I'm honestly not going to remember many of the characters/their names, so I'm not going to remember what was said about them at the end of the film either. This is a good character study, but I have seen plenty of better WWII films.",8,0,2,13 July 2015
Whiplash," The One That Should Have Had Better Oscar Potential
","This was THE BEST film of 2014.The editing of this film gives it a very fast pace, making it seem as though an hour and forty minutes goes by in just under an hour. It is easy to see why this film won the Oscar for this category.What I find really brilliant is the use of sound in this film. There are great moments when the diegetic music within the film blends with and transitions into the score of the film. There are also super tense moments highlighted by haunting moments of total silence. As I have said before in other reviews, the lack of an element is just as effective as the element itself. The greatest 'silence' in this film is probably at the conclusion of this film when we see the two main characters' sets of eyes as they look at each other, now working together, understanding each other.The acting is beyond phenomenal. J.K. Simmons, one of the nicest guys in Hollywood is absolutely terrifying, but you also can't help understanding where he comes from when he explains he is trying to get students to recognize their potential. If abuse is what it takes to create the next Charlie Parker, it is justified since you are giving the world the next great artist. As for Miles Teller, his acting apparently fell short of Oscar-worthy. I feel his performance was somewhat underrated, but I do not believe it was his fault - some of the dialogue his character had was a little flat from time to time.The best aspects of this film happen in scenes that involve music performance, whether it is a rehearsal, a competition, or what will become one of the most iconic endings in Hollywood history. In scenes that examine Teller's character outside of his music performance there are strange and somewhat forced aspects. I nearly roll my eyes at the scene where he talks with his family (I think) about how they should pay more attention to him because it is all about the rivalry between sports and the arts. I like it because it shows how much of a jerk Andrew can be, but it practically force- feeds the audience the idea that the arts are not respected enough. However, I suppose this is realistic dinner conversation, especially the dialogue coming from Andrew.This is a movie with very few flaws and I give it my highest rating.",10,1,3,13 March 2015
"Hail, Caesar!"," Interesting, Just Not Up to Coen Brothers Caliber
","This movie has a great ensemble cast, but it is a shame that some of the characters that have great potential are not followed throughout the entirety of the film. We tend to stick to a few key characters, and it is a shame we have strong actors like Scarlett Johansson who do not receive a lot of screen time even though they make up the ensemble cast.As this was advertised as a comedy it would have been nice to see more humor in the movie, though even though there are a few key moments that are funny, all of these moments are hilarious. A lot of these moments happen to be focused around a character named Hobie who is an action-star-turned-speaking-actor, and his interaction with Ralph Fiennes proves to be comedic gold. Also, pay attention for a segment with the premiere of a movie Hobie stars in called 'Lazy Ol' Moon.' It makes older movies look like caricatures.What holds the film together is that while it is made up of an ensemble cast, there are only a few stories to follow, so it is difficult to get lost in these stories. Some of the stories are more enticing than the others, however, but you will find them to be intertwined so it all makes sense.The direction of this movie still shows the Coen brothers are strong directors. The movie looks brilliant, the art direction makes it very believable that we are experiencing old Hollywood, and there are extremely well-choreographed and well-executed sequences. This is a good Coen brothers films, but it is not that high on the list compared to the rest of their canon.3.0/4.0",7,3,10,6 February 2016
Jaws," How Did Such a Young Director Create this Masterpiece?
","I admittedly think Steven Spielberg is a rather overrated director - he seems to make quantity over quality - but boy, this film certainly falls into the quality category, and we need to remember this was one of the director's first few movies.It amazes me that we got such a great film when there were a lot of problems on set, the most significant one being the mechanical shark not working properly. I believe they also weren't on schedule and definitely went over budget for this film. Spielberg was very clever to compensate for the mechanical shark though - he turned to suspense, a la Hitchcock, to frighten the audience by not actually showing the shark until halfway through the film, which was a brilliant decision. Who knows? Maybe the film would have seemed more quirky if more of the mechanical shark was shown if it wasn't malfunctioning.The character development of Brody is simple, yet really strong and smart for the context of the movie. When you're up against a giant shark to defend an island community, what a train wreck it is to be afraid of the water. At the conclusion with the closing line 'I used to hate the water, I can't imagine why' we know he's come full circle - if Brody can take on a monster of the sea, what makes you think water would still scare him?Jaws also has some really good humor, a lot of it stemming from the character played by Richard Dreyfuss. The quirky shark-studier is a great character to balance out the tension between a man who wants to protect his community and a man who has a personal vendetta against sharks - who by the way delivers one of the best monologues in film history.One thing that bothers me is that Brody is blamed for the first couple of victims when the mayor of the town puts heavy pressure on Brody to keep the beaches open in order to turn a profit. It doesn't bother me in the sense that it is a bad aspect of the film, it just seems unfair, and you sort of sympathize with Brody since he wanted to protect the community and he let the community down. If anything, this is a great aspect of the film if it gets you to sympathize with Brody like it did for me.Even though this film is PG, maybe hold off on showing it to kids (unless they close their eyes at certain points) as it can upset them easily - I was terrified of Quint spurting out blood at the end of the film as a child. In general though, this is a movie everyone should see in their lifetime.",10,2,5,6 July 2015
The Shawshank Redemption," So Inspirational it has Saved Lives
","The Shawshank Redemption will be the highest praised film by the general public for decades to come. It is very tough to dislike this film; perhaps there are some that find it overrated, but its message speaks to anybody who has a heart and soul.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) befriends Red (Morgan Freeman) shortly after he is convicted to serve two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover. He is somewhat of a mystery to Red since he does not seem like a murderer at all and goes out of his way to improve Shawshank prison by attempting to establish a better library in the prison by himself. He is better educated than most and his friends learn from him and follow him as if he was the Lord. Most importantly, he sticks to the idea of hope even after having a couple horrible years at the beginning of his sentence.Dufresne is a great character and role model for his friends, but the story's focus is on Red's reaction to Andy's actions and influence on the group. He becomes so close to Andy that he confesses his guilt to Andy in privacy as if Andy was a priest. This is a surprise to Andy since the inmates have a joke that 'everybody in Shawshank is innocent.'These two stars are incredible in the film, though Freeman expresses a little more emotion than Robbins does. Robbins is essentially there to be a guide for his character's friends while Freeman is a voice of reason through learning from his experience in prison. He plays a character who is a little bit older than the rest (besides a character named Brooks) and who understands and fears the notion of becoming institutionalized.This story of friendship and hope is inspirational in countless ways. At several times it seems to implicate that characters will give up but at the last second they make a hard turn and decide to move on and persevere. This is a drama, so not everything which unfolds is happy, but the dreariness within the film makes the case for the power of hope that much stronger.There are so many memorable things about The Shawshank Redemption. It has phenomenal leading performances, brilliant music by Thomas Newman, its use of Mozart in relation to the setting of a prison is powerful, the interaction of the characters make for some memorable comedic bits to help us make it through the drama, and the list goes on and on. And even without these factors, the movie is superb at getting such an inspiring message across, and the ending maybe have you weeping with joy.Even though this is not the greatest movie ever made, this is the one film everybody must watch in their lifetime. Powerful stuff.4.0/4.0",10,0,0,9 January 2016
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," In My Top 3 of 2014
","Whereas Boyhood was monumental in that it took risks in the fact that it was shot over 12 years, Birdman is monumental in that the film is essentially supposed to feel like it is all done in one long take (aside from the beginning and ending of the film).There are many great aspects of this film, the first being the amazing cast of actors. Michael Keaton leads this cast with an incredible performance, having to show different personalities through his Birdman persona as well as the washed up Riggan, who is very passionate about the performing arts to say the least. I have not seen The Theory of Everything, so I cannot call Redmayne's win for best leading actor a snub, but I can say that Keaton was at his best and I am glad he was considered for the Oscar.My favorite performance of the film, however, comes from Edward Norton, and this might be my 2nd favorite performance of the year behind J.K. Simmons in Whiplash. Norton is this superhero of an actor, Mike, who is so devoted to realism that he drinks actual gin to get the feel of an era, or that he 'gets hard' as he delves into a sexual experience his character is having. It is particularly fun to watch him give suggestions to and act in front of Riggan to show true artistry - Norton's acting within acting is right on the money.As for the visuals of this film, A+. Amazing concept to do a film in one long take (what is supposed to feel like one take) especially when this take requires moving the camera all over the place around this theatre setting.However, this film does seem overly repetitive at points, striking home the idea that we're not living as we are meant to live. This comes from lines such as 'stop looking through your phones and actually experience something' and various 'rants.' While I am a big fan of monologues, this film seems a little monologue-heavy in order to get its philosophy across. Emma stone rants about how Riggan wants significance in his life though he is not important; Riggan rants to the critic that she doesn't truly understand meaning (or significance); Norton rants that you have to delve into literature - in this case plays - to find their significance; you see the pattern, right?I like the ambiguity of the ending, but it could have ended stronger in a different spot. This different spot I refer to made my heart race so much during my first viewing of the film. I will not spoil the last shot of the film, but I like that though it does not give a clear explanation of its final shot, Birdman meshes the realistic with the unrealistic, just how Riggan has been in and out of the unreality of the play he is putting on throughout the movie.I highly recommend this film; a great drama that contains a lot of smart comedy.",9,0,4,7 March 2015
The Big Short," A Ton (and I mean A TON) of Jargon
","Well, people with knowledge about economics and loans will understand this film better than most. Most will spend the film trying to wrap their heads around what is being said. This is the exact reason there are moments in the film which break the fourth wall - specific celebrities are depicted (as themselves) giving oversimplified analogies directly to the audience to help them along the way. Thanks for the help, but it would be nice to be able to understand what is said in the first place than to be patted on the back by the filmmakers who are saying 'it's okay, we know you're trying your best but we're here to help.'In the sense that the economic jargon is complex the film is not necessarily bad, but it fails to be entertaining. What IS entertaining is the acting. All good performances here. Christian Bale plays a manic with subtle giveaways such as his distracted persona and his jamming out to music and nonchalant failure to wear shoes in the office. It's hard to say whether his manic depiction of Michael Burry is accurate, but it makes sense and is well-done since manic is very close to genius sometimes, which is exactly what Burry proves to be in this film. Bale can definitely play unstable from viewing previous performances in American Psycho and The Fighter, and he does it again here. Ryan Gosling adds personality to the film, not falling short when portraying a self-righteous jerk whose narration is not that different than DiCaprio's narration in The Wolf of Wall Street. Steve Carell is great in a dramatic role once again after proving his dramatic ability in roles in Little Miss Sunshine and Foxcathcer. Brad Pitt is okay - we don't really get to see much of him in the film, but he plays his character as it was meant to be played. There is a good moment when his character acts as a moral voice of reason, and that is probably the most emotional moment for him in the film and it is very quick.Discussing The Big Short after viewing it is a recommendation - it might help to clarify that the story in general is understandable and deals with good questions about morality versus greed. However, when a film goes over the heads of the audience as much as this film did, it fails to be entertaining. This is a good film but it lacks entertainment - especially from a known comedic director.2.0/4.0",5,9,21,5 January 2016
Prometheus," Haven't Seen the Alien Movies, Still Know This Doesn't Live Up to Them
","This movie is filled with characters I don't really care for - besides David, who is a twisted cyborg - who come up with conclusions with little evidence. For example, after the opening of the film Noomi Rapace looks at cave drawings of a man and what appear to be UFO's, to which she just assumes 'I think they want us to come find them.'Thus begins a journey for her and a full crew to 'meet their makers.' This corresponds with the opening of the film where what looks like a gray-skinned super human who drinks something which causes him to disintegrate, and once his matter is in the water it reforms into DNA, which is when we see the title 'Prometheus.'Unnecessary aspects of this movie: Guy Pearce did not have to play an old man in crappy makeup - they could have just hired an older actor. There is dispute whether or not Charlize Theron's character is a robot, which she clearly isn't. Also, she's pretty much in the movie to be a b**** and to show her stupidity in not knowing how to run adjacent to a giant ship about to crush her instead of in a straight line which the circular ship follows.So at one point they end up 'meeting their makers' as they believe them to be, but what pisses me off is that the 'engineer' simply rips David's head off of his body and attacks the others. Noomi Rapace wants to know why their makers hate them, and so do I, but if they are displeased, why follow their path into a sequel? Wouldn't they just want to kill humans like the one in this movie clearly did?I can see why they avoided saying this was a prequel to Alien - it hardly deals with things I assume to come from those movies, but addresses it right before the credits. This could have been better if they decided to make a standalone film not connected to Alien AT ALL. There are actually plenty of ways this film could have been better.",3,1,3,21 March 2015
Straight Outta Compton," Two Different Issues at the Heart of an Intriguing Biopic
","The way I see it, Straight Outta Compton has two clear halves of the story of N.W.A. The first half revolves around the struggles the group faced shortly after its inception with racist cops (but in the cops' justification the group looks like a group of gangbangers), and the second half revolves around Ice Cube's fallout from the group due to not trusting the manager played by Paul Giamatti.The opening of this film deals with Eazy-E before he became Eazy-E, and while it seems out of place, starting a movie about a music group, it lets us know how the group came up with the money to get started. We learn Eazy-E is a big drug dealer in a sequence where he is getting scammed out of his money and then must make a run for it when the cops show up shortly afterward (and very conveniently). It is probably the closest the film comes to an 'action' sequence, and it gives us a sense of the life the group members had in Compton before they came to be a popular rap group. The main thing to take away from the opening is that it is exciting for a biopic.One of the best scenes of this film is towards the end of the 'first half' I described in the first paragraph. A seemingly simple sequence which visually describes the band's inspiration behind their popular song 'F*** Tha Police' paves way for a scene when police officers attempt to stop NWA from performing that song. Of course NWA doesn't listen to them and perform the song in order to give a stance for freedom of speech, and they do so very effectively, motivating their fans to riot against police once shots are fired. It is very satisfying to watch with all the unnecessary police brutality we still see today - the scene is relevant today even if it depicts events from the 90s.The second half is just as interesting and focuses more on what each character wants independently of the other characters/members of NWA. It all starts when Ice Cube - played by Ice Cube's son - refuses to sign a contract with the Paul Giamatti character since it seems he and Eazy-E are ripping off the rest of the group. Ice Cube definitely has a right to take a stance since he is depicted as the best lyricist of the group, constantly writing lyrics on pads before NWA's rise to fame. Ice Cube even scares the group (at least Giamatti's character) when he produces a track that cleverly tries to put the rest of NWA in their place. Ice Cube's son dominates this half of the film as his father (they look like the same exact person by the way) and I feel he is deserving of an Oscar nomination - my guess is that if he gets a nomination it will be for a supporting role. The only thing I dislike about this second half of the film is that just like in The Social Network the business dispute is not well-explained, and this seems to be because the filmmakers try to dumb it down to just 'contract disagreements' for the audience. I would prefer more detail, even if I wouldn't fully understand it at first.You should go see this film not to learn about NWA, but because it is simply a great film which just happens to be grounded in a story about NWA.3.5/4.0",9,4,34,26 August 2015
Iron Man," Good for a First Installment
","Most superhero movies turn into franchises, unless you're talking about the two different Hulk movies, and the first of the franchise usually mildly entertains and provides a formulaic origin story. Iron Man is an exception - it is wildly entertaining.I think Robert Downey Jr. nails his role as Tony Stark. So he can get an Oscar nomination for Tropic Thunder but not for this? Johnny Depp can be nominated for Pirates but RDJ can't be nominated for Iron Man? Robert Downey Jr successfully brings Tony Stark to life in this live-action film, showing a big ego along with insecurities such as his on and off feelings for Pepper and his realization that he must sometimes depend on the help of others.There are plenty of humorous parts in the film as well, a lot of them revolving around Tony, but who can't laugh at such a great portrayal of a jackass? The funniest part for me had to be when a scientist apologizes for not being Tony Stark.Towards the conclusion of the movie some aspects do not add up, especially involving Obediah. He has Tony's suit recreated and just happens to know how to run it properly on his first go? Tony is directly over the blast Pepper starts in order to finish off Obediah, and is hardly affected? The third act is everything when it comes to an action film, and it is sad to see some movies take shortcuts to develop a good third act instead of a great one. However, the third act is redeemed so to speak with the iconic ending of Tony Stark admitting he is Iron Man.Fun first installment with an okay third act.",8,2,3,17 April 2015
Blade Runner," Mediocre Movie with a Great Third Act
","My opinion of a film usually relies heavily on the conclusion of the film. My favorite movie, Pulp Fiction, has a stunning and nearly mind-blowing ending. The same goes for other films I love such as Psycho, Memento, The Prestige, and It's a Wonderful Life. But when I read Blade Runner I read it as a boring movie with a great ending which gives the film great meaning. I haven't seen the theatrical version, but I have seen clips of it, and I think the voice-overs by Deckard take away from the film even more. While the noir film usually relies on narration, this film is fine with this aspect taken away, leaving Deckard's thoughts more ambiguous to us as an audience.I have to admit I think the concept of the film is intriguing. We learn with the help of text at the film's opening that replicants have been created as slaves, but since they are intelligent they have turned on their creators. The title of the film refers to those who are meant to 'retire' these replicants.The mise-en-scene of the film has a Gothic quality to it which really leaves me with an unpleasant taste in my mouth. It fits into the noir aspect of the film since it is so dark, but it also has a really creepy quality to it which the film does not need. In scenes revolving around Sebastian, the man creates these 'friends' for himself, these living puppets in a sense, which underscores the motif in the film of playing God, or creating life. The replicant Pris seems to blend in with these creations since she looks otherworldly, with white makeup covering her face, black around the eyes, hair almost as light as her makeup. It's like she is from the circus, which does not belong in a movie revolving around city life.Perhaps the mise-en-scene will grow on me over time; I hated it on first viewing, but I realize it adds to the dark tone of the movie and is fitting. In a final fight between the Blade Runner and Roy, Roy shows compassion and helps Deckard to live since he is about to die, but we have no idea when Roy is meant to die, just that his life is running out due to a four year lifespan. While he gives a brilliant monologue, Roy dies with no preparation for the audience. We might have viewed Roy with more empathy if we knew he was going to die in a matter of minutes, but it is still a powerful death.The movie has a brilliant ending in which an origami unicorn is placed in Deckard's place. It is said that replicants have built-in memories, and earlier in the film he dreams of a unicorn. The cop knowing about the unicorn suggests that Deckard is perhaps a replicant himself, which is a brilliant ending which gives the film a whole new meaning.",7,1,4,24 April 2015
Son of Saul," Can a WWII Movie Ever go Wrong?
","Seeing this movie is like watching Elephant by Gus Van Sant (in terms of the visual style), but maybe five times more depressing. A lot of the film is done in long takes where we follow Saul's perspective from behind his head as he navigates his complex journey, interweaving between various work groups in different concentration camps.What is both great and confusing about the movie is that the plot points are touched on very briefly. The way that conversations take place in Son of Saul are naturalistic: since the characters are aware of what they are talking about and planning, things are not overly explained, allowing the audience to fill in the information not given to them. The general ideas of the plot points are easy to follow, but multiple viewings may be required to FULLY register what is happening.The film takes place in a matter of about a day and a half, and while the movie only runs at less than two hours, with all the long takes the movie feels close to running in 'real time.' Because of these elaborate long takes like in The Revenant, released the same year, we have to admire the direction and choreography involved in all of these long takes, especially considering the large amounts of extras used in the film to make it feel authentic.This isn't a traditional narrative as far as cinema goes, but it is a great one. People die without much attention focused on each death: the characters move on, but isn't that closer to authenticity? To reality? It's been done before in films like Saving Private Ryan and Children of Men and it encapsulates the sad reality of death in war: it happens and there is nothing to do about it. This being said, some may not like the protagonist, Saul, for similar reasons, but then again this is not an uplifting movie by any means.One last note: the film has a 4:3 ratio rather than what has become the standard: either 16:9 or 2.35:1, but this does not make the film worse by any means. This is a great foreign film from the 2010's.3.5/4.0",9,1,6,21 February 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A Good Start to a New Trilogy
","Looking at the trailers for this film, I was worried The Force Awakens would have a tone closer to an original JJ Abrams film than to the original Star Wars movies. Boy was I wrong. This film has all the quip and action of the original trilogy, making it an enjoyable ride for this viewer. The only differences in style are actually improvements: the cinematography and the image quality.However, this movie is not without its set of flaws. I suppose when you're expecting a full trilogy you should expect the story to set up elements that will be revisited later in the trilogy. However, looking back at the original Star Wars (now titled A New Hope) we received a strong stand-alone film, and I would have liked to see that with episode 7 rather than ending the film on somewhat of a cliffhanger.I was also a little disappointed with the new villain Kylo Ren, to be honest. It is pretty cool when you find out who he actually is, but that does not make up for the fact that he is susceptible to temper tantrums and there seems to be no real reason for him to wear the mask aside from the fact that it pays tribute to Darth Vader and gives him more of a threatening presence. Also, just like Vader having the emperor above him, we see Lord Snoke communicating with Kylo Ren and the other 'leader' of the First Order (Domhnall Gleeson) but we don't yet know much about him. Hopefully we will get more of an explanation with the next installment of the trilogy.The new cast members bring new life to the series in a positive way. Finn, Rey, and Poe are the main characters (aside from Kylo Ren) that are made up of these newcomers, and Poe is played by Oscar Isaac, who has had great performances in Inside Llewyn Davis and Ex Machina, which released earlier in 2015. Finn is the stormtrooper gone good who you can't help but root for as he tries to impress Rey. Rey essentially has the same role as Luke did in the original Star Wars, and she does a fantastic job at being a bad-ass character. We don't see as much of Poe as I would have hoped, but the story in the film could not have started without him. I hope they don't throw Oscar Isaac under the bus in the next installments; he has great potential.This film is good fun, but one can't help comparing The Force Awakens to Star Wars (A New Hope) in a number of different ways. 1) A droid with important information is the MacGuffin of the film. 2) Rey is from the desert planet of Jakku, lacking adventure in her life. 3) The First Order is basically The Empire with a new name. I'll stop there to avoid revealing too much.The Force Awakens is a decent way to start this sequel trilogy, and while this installment nearly lived up to the original trilogy, I am hoping the next installments will succeed at doing just that.3.0/4.0",8,5,37,3 January 2016
The Matrix," Just Awesome
","The Matrix is the type of gem that only comes around once a decade. It is a great film that combines top-notch philosophy (Plato's allegory of the cave) with the coolest action scenes in a long time. It was awesome to learn that some of the coolest effects in the film were achieved by having hundreds of cameras set up to take pictures simultaneously to get the same image from different angles, simulating camera movement when edited together.On surface level, this film is simply really cool to watch. The shootout before Neo and Trinity enter the elevator is one of the most iconic action scenes in film history. We get all the fun of a lot of bullet fire, one-handed cartwheels, walking up a person's body just to kick them in the face, and a lot more fun choreography to go along with all of this.I love that this film makes ideas from Plato interesting and relevant via sci-fi motifs. There is also the notion of 'the one' in the film. I have to admit, this motif gets somewhat annoying at times; everyone seems to say 'he is the one' at one point or another in this film. People see it as a Christ story, but just because somebody is resurrected doesn't make them Jesus. I mean does he die for sins? There is also no clear connection to a god in this story, which goes against the ideas Christianity. I think Plato is more relevant here.What is on and off for me is my opinion on Keanu Reeves' performance. I used to think his performance in this film is terrible, but I've realized his playing dumb/ignorant is spot-on. The scene where he questions if he should save Morpheus seems to lack some emotion, but I now realize this is one of the few instances of 'poor' acting coming from Reeves in the film.This film would be perfect with a slightly better lead than Keanu Reeves, but this movie is still f***ing awesome.",9,1,2,29 April 2015
Deadpool," Funniest Comic Book Movie in a Long Time
","If there's one thing Deadpool does, it is entertaining the audience. It breaks the fourth wall constantly, which any how-to-write-a- screenplay book would surely suggest not to do as it defeats the illusion of the movie to do this. But this is not just any movie. This is Deadpool.Ryan Reynolds is the perfect choice of casting to play the titular character. His quip constantly hits the audience blow after blow to prove for a very likable superhero (though he wouldn't call himself a hero). He may be in the suit, but it is his voice acting which really captures the essence of Deadpool. You can undoubtedly hear the sarcasm or the attitude that comes with all of his one liners.The movie is balanced in the sense that it flips back and forth between chronology, rather than have all the exposition packed into the first half hour and follow the character on a linear path to him becoming the super human he becomes. Instead we have to ask questions as an audience, and Deadpool promises he will reveal the answers in flashbacks, or rather with inter-cutting within the film.Sadly, pretty much all of the cool action is revealed in the red band trailers of the film, which has us wanting more surprises which we never get. Overall, the film seems to only have 2 key action sequences on top of that, meaning this film is more about the origin story than it is about delivering theatrics, although that is probably the point since is the first Deadpool film (please let there be sequels!) Another disappointing aspect is the fact that the CGI for the character Colossus is not that great.Deadpool is a fun experience, and it will have you asking whether all the fourth-wall-breaking makes it a more enjoyable experience as a Marvel movie.3.0/4.0",8,4,13,13 February 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Don't Judge a Movie by Its Trailer
","I like Matthew Vaughn as a director, I absolutely loved Kick-Ass, but the trailer for this film didn't seem that enticing to me. It didn't show much of the great action within the film, but rather focused on the ONE scene in which Colin Firth fights with an umbrella, which I thought was extremely lame. Within fifteen minutes of the start of the film, I was really engaged in the movie, jaw dropping when a guy was literally cut in half.I immediately thought it would be ridiculously fun just like Kick- Ass, and it was! The second act is a typical spy movie training session with a few good twists and turns. The people at Kingsman put the young candidates through hell in order to test their limits and loyalty, which provide some of the best moments of the film.Samuel L Jackson makes for a good villain, but with a really annoying lisp that didn't seem necessary for the film. The only reason I can think of for that lisp is to make for a somewhat ridiculous villain who is simultaneously ruthless.One of the most exciting scenes of the film is one in which a massive brawl occurs in a church, and the fight is done in a few long takes, choreographed to the beat of Free Bird in the background. It is one of the best executed action sequences I have seen in years. Also, the third act is just really ridiculous and fun that you just have to see it for yourself.I wanted to see this movie eventually because of Matthew Vaughn, but I was so wrong to expect less of this movie due to the trailer. The very last moment of the movie is said to be controversial, but I thought it was a great way to wrap up such a ridiculous film. It made sense when it was said in an interview the ending was paying an homage to sexual jokes at the end of James Bond flicks or North by Northwest.",9,2,7,18 May 2015
Jackie Brown," Not Tarantino's Best, Still a Damn Good Movie
","After seeing it once when I was about 17 or 18, I didn't care too much for this film. It was 'complex' - which I realize to be false after a second viewing - and it was very slow. Watching it again at the age of 22, I actually paid good attention to what was unfolding before me and appreciated this flick which diverged from the typical Tarantino style.Going into this film, you should note that it is heavily laced with dialogue sequences and is Tarantino's least violent and least action-packed film. I suggest you pay careful attention to what is said by each character as well, as characters are being described and discussed before they appear in the film.The main story is of particular interest, as it follows the heroine, Jackie Brown, as she struggles for survival while being pulled by two opposing forces - the arms dealer, played by Samuel L Jackson, who is hesitant to trust Jackie, and the cops who are trying to take the arms dealer down. Interestingly enough, we also have a male character who lies somewhere between these two poles. He is a bonds man, played by Robert Forster, who Jackie seems to depend on for advice. You may think he is a man of the law at first due to his occupation, but he ends up being about as morally ambiguous as Jackie Brown, experiencing Jackie's story and her actions without bringing his knowledge to the cops whatsoever.Aside from being slow at certain parts, the main bit of criticism I have to give this film is that it seems way too heavy on close-ups or shots that zoom into close-ups and pull back as a reaction. I understand Tarantino wanted us to get close to certain characters, experience what they are experiencing, getting more intimate etc etc, but this was a motif so obvious it annoyed me.This film may feel long at points, but it seems the extra time is necessary to develop each character in the ensemble cast well enough to understand who they are and what their goals are in this very intricate story. I would recommend this film to anybody who appreciates a good drama or to any Tarantino fans so they may experience his range as a director.3.0/4.0",8,0,1,3 December 2015
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Hands Down One of the Funniest Movies Ever
","When it comes to comedies, they tend to be hit-or-miss movies. The sense of humor that goes into comedies reaches some audiences while others find it distasteful. That being said, it can be safely said that Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a comedy for virtually everyone. It is even a good experience for children since there is really only one suggestive scene and it is very brief.Nearly every scene in this film is comic gold and very quotable. Who can forget the black night remarking ''tis but a flesh wound,' the holy hand grenade, or even the opening scene (are you suggesting coconuts migrate)? Even great historical allusions are made for humor, such as a reference to the idea of the Trojan horse.The film also has a great sense of self-awareness and is very meta. The narrator comments on the animator at one point, a woman dressed in white refers to the script of the film, and the characters refer to specific scenes from earlier in the film. This is all in good fun and its self-awareness is primarily meant to add to the humor rather than commenting on art in general which more 'serious' meta texts tend to do.However, this is a strange film when you take into account that from time to time in the film historians appear to briefly comment on the time period and are disregarded the next second as well as other people that are clearly not from the medieval time period becoming involved in the film. This aspect causes the film to end very strangely and abruptly. Monty Python and the Holy Grail would be stronger if it had a more definitive conclusion than the one it does.Filled with comedic gold, Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a very enjoyable experience.3.5/4.0",9,1,2,25 February 2016
True Romance," Odd Title
","Knowing this film was written by Tarantino, it was a no-brainer that it would be violent and rich in dialogue. It also seemed like a strange title since Tarantino has never directed a romance story, and this movie is only devoted to the titular romance at certain moments. Rather than focusing on the actual romance, this film primarily focuses on the aftermath of Clarence's decision to 'rescue' Alabama from her pimp. What I mean by this is that the movie is driven by the fact that people are after Clarence once he steals some cocaine as well as by Clarence's sense of freedom by sitting on a fortune as long as he sells the coke. The romance is something that compliments this story.When the romance is actually given attention in the film it proves to be interesting. Clarence learns that Alabama is a prostitute who his boss had hired to show Clarence a good time on his birthday, and this makes no difference to his feelings for Alabama. She is touched that he genuinely had a good time with her - the greatest time he has had with a girl in his whole life. Sex is not the deciding factor here; Clarence loves Alabama for who she is, what she loves, her comforting presence. Perhaps this is the meaning of the title - the romance is formed regardless of the situation of how the two met. The two are together throughout the movie, but it is a shame that most of the film focuses on the crime Clarence becomes involved in rather than the dynamics of this relationship.This movie is made up of a stellar cast, and it is a shame that a good amount of recognizable names are only in the film very briefly. Though Tarantino only wrote this film we see a lot of faces found in films which he directed: Brad Pitt, Samuel L Jackson, Christopher Walken, and Chris Penn. Christian Slater as Clarence is a perfect fit for the role though he is not a well-known actor. He adds great personality to Clarence who is a true Tarantino character, defined by his taste in pop culture, as well as just a touch of craziness to make his desperation believable.Perhaps it is because this film is directed by Tony Scott and not Tarantino, but True Romance is a decent story which lacks Tarantino- level energy, especially in its action sequences. True Romance is a fun experience if you keep in mind it is a screenplay by Tarantino in his early days.3.0/4.0",7,0,0,8 January 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," The Most Entertaining of the Bunch
","This has to be the most action-packed movie I have seen in a long time regarding movies I have seen at the theater. After watching the original three of the franchise I have to say this is my favorite 'Mad Max' to date with the 2nd one falling closely behind. The 2nd one may overall a better movie in terms of its themes and the development of Max as a character, but I definitely enjoy this 2015 release the most.Fury Road opens with Max mentioning he used to be a Road Warrior (an allusion to the second film) and we see jolting flashbacks to what seems to be his son dying in a road incident in this post- apocalyptic world. In this sense, the film seems to combine a sequel with a reboot since Max lost his family in the first film, yet the film does not reference specific moments from the earlier films other than this. With the style more focused on the action, a fast pace throughout, and more modern cinematography, I would classify this more as a reboot.This movie has received a lot of hype, and while I enjoyed this movie very much I would not be so quick to judge it as one of the greatest action films of all time; I may have to see Fury Road a few times because of this. The plot is ridiculously simple at face value: one side character even sums it up perfectly by asking 'all this over a family squabble?' Max is a loner captured by a community that resides at a place called 'The Citadel,' and he is forced into the middle of a battle instigated by Furiosa wanting to bring the leader's several wives to a land of safety. When they realize this land doesn't exist anymore, they decide to go back to The Citadel, fighting the warriors of the community who have been pursuing them the whole time. That's it.I'm not sure what to make of Tom Hardy's performance as Max. The opening voice-over sets the tone of the movie perfectly, and the voice Hardy uses even makes him sound like Mel Gibson from the original trilogy. We don't get much dialogue from Max throughout the film - which is perfectly fine - but his body language seems to only say one thing for a long while: mistrust. Max is so paranoid of Furiosa and the women she is protecting at first that he threatens them with an unloaded weapon, watches them constantly and disarms them as soon as he gets the chance, and actually fires warning shots that end up getting one of them injured. His grief is represented by the jolting flashbacks to the death of his son, which could have been handled with more subtlety as in the 2nd Mad Max.Other than this, what is there to say about the action in the film other than high praise? I don't know how he did it, but George Miller was able to create many well-choreographed and carefully thought-out action sequences with little CGI and involving many various vehicles. I'd have to say the best road-based action I've ever seen takes place in this film.This is one of the best films the first half of 2015 has to offer, but it is not a perfect movie. If you love action movies, then it probably is the perfect movie for you. Go see this film if you want the experience of a roller coaster.",9,4,20,10 June 2015
Jurassic Park," A Lot Better Than It Appears To Be
","I remember having a conversation with my cousin, asking him why Jurassic Park intrigued him if his priority when it comes to film is good character development. He said it has good philosophical discussion, and he pointed out the scene he was referring to: the 'life finds a way' scene, and I had forgotten this gem within the movie. And recently a friend of mine pointed out that Dr. Grant ties two female ends of seat belts together to strap himself in which is a great metaphor for this motif of the dinosaurs supposedly being all female.These philosophical aspects, including the amazing scene focusing on a debate of whether it is responsible to try to add dinosaurs back into the swing of things altogether, raise the movie up higher than the mere B movie critics believe it to be. But is there anything wrong with the overall fun and excitement of this seemingly simple people? We see dinosaurs on-screen for the first time in a much different way - both with the use of animatronics and digitally. We also have the quirky characters such as Wayne Knight and Jeff Goldblum's characters to add to the fun.The film is pretty aware of itself, making references to King Kong and displaying the dinosaurs as a spectacle to future park-goers, just as the idea of the effects to make the dinosaurs are a spectacle to us as movie-goers. It also draws attention to its potential horror towards little kids with Dr. Grant illustrating the idea of a velociraptor to a cocky kid, and the grandkids that tag along for the park ride that are shown screaming on-screen.What a great, underrated movie by Spielberg.",9,3,3,22 April 2015
The Martian," Unexpected Good Fun
","The Martian was deemed a comedy by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for the Golden Globe awards. It is definitely one of the most fun Ridley Scott films to date, even if it doesn't reach the sophistication of his films Alien and Blade Runner. This film is definitely not trying to be a comedy, however - it is a drama with a fun tone to it.Contributing to this fun tone is an ensemble made up of actors with great comedic chops such as Kristen Wiig, Donald Glover, and Michael Pena. Matt Damon recording his log while on Mars also proves to be funny throughout most of the movie. His character is great and shows a wide range of personality - he is a smart-aleck and sarcastic when he is optimistic, and he is rightfully ticked off the next moment. In both of these situations Damon plays it so perfectly to come across as funny in both instances.His performance does get more dramatic though. As he spends more and more time on Mars he becomes desperate yet optimistic that he will be rescued. It is also unclear whether Damon had to lose weight for part of the performance, as weight loss in the character was noticeable but seemed almost unnatural upon viewing - heavy chance cgi was involved. Either way, Damon's performance in this film proves to show talent on a wide range of the spectrum.The shots are constructed very well in this film. The editing proves to be interesting as well. A lot of point of view shots are used and are labeled as such - most notably there are shots that represent directly the video log Damon's character is recording, and shots from inside his helmet and over his shoulder are used and labeled along the lines of 'suit camera - Watney.'There's also a huge focus on technology - most notably screens - in this film as well. It is how NASA must communicate with Watney - first by satellite images, then by a camera on Mars with Watney, then through what is essentially e-mail. When NASA is communicating with other people on Earth the communication is done through the use of screens as well. It is unclear whether this is simply because technology allows for this way to communicate in our day and age, or if this is a commentary on the way we use technology. Or perhaps this is to compare and contrast to Watney's struggles - he is constantly recording video logs, but those logs are not used for communication.In the third act of the film it seems very similar to Apollo 13 since the focus is to help an astronaut come home. Since the struggle is to retrieve a lone survivor rather than to figure how to land on Earth safely, it proves to be more interesting and a lot more complex. Looking over the other great films of 2015, this film is amongst them, but not quite towards the top. This was an unexpectedly really fun movie from Ridley Scott.3.5/4.0",9,3,5,13 January 2016
