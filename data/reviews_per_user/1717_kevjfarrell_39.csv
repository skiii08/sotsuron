Ghost," Whoopi is the real star!
","This is a fun movie. It's part love story, part tragedy and a whole chunk of comedy to keep it moving at a good pace. I would say this is probably one of Whoopi's finest acting performances - OK it might be lightweight and comedic, but hey, there's nothing wrong with that!!! And it takes a great actress to pull off comedy the way that she does! Plenty of sentimental moments. It's simplistic in its message, but that's not a flaw, it's an accolade. If you've experienced somebody very close to you who has died, this is the way you would like to think that they cross over, if you believe there's something else after this earthly life. The sentimental scenes are acted beautifully. Sit back and enjoy!",8,2,3,21 February 2015
The Ring," Didn't live up to the hype!
","Maybe I'm just getting old and have seen too many horror movies through my lifetime, but this one failed to impress me.It was very formulaic - tension in the right places, and times that made you jump, but that doesn't make a good horror story. I am a fan of this genre but feel this one offers nothing new. Even the acting performances weren't particularly notable.I am quite capable of suspending belief for the sake of a good horror movie, but saying that, some of the reactions to certain situations just didn't add up for me. There were too many flaws - style over substance. It might have more appeal to younger people who haven't seen a huge selection of the horror genre yet. I really would like to be more complimentary - sorry!",5,2,3,24 August 2015
Dead Poets Society," Inspirational
","Every school should have a teacher like Mr. Keating (Robin Williams). He is inspirational and teaches young men to think for themselves and look at life differently. If I'd had a teacher like that, I might have done better in school! For me, it's the theme of the story that is the most important. The acting performances are secondary. I've watched the movie about three times now, and I still find myself getting inspired - and getting a boost to my self confidence! Robin Williams is excellent in this type of role - in my opinion, I prefer his performances in drama rather than comedy.This movie should be shown in all schools for 12-13 year olds. It's especially motivating for those who may lack confidence and are somewhat meek and mild. This movie gives them a voice. A teacher like Mr. Keating shapes the lives of young men and teaches them more than any classroom book can. It's a life affirming movie. I love the movie!",8,2,2,3 August 2015
Brokeback Mountain," A first rate movie
","This movie is superbly acted by the two main characters. A realistic portrayal of repressed homosexuality between two guys who keep up the appearance of being macho. Heath Ledger's character tries hard to fight his natural urges but the draw is just too great for him. In his mind it is wrong, but his body tells him otherwise. Jake G's character accepts his sexuality but knows he needs to keep it secret. It portrays an era and a sensitive subject so accurately. I hope macho men aren't put off this movie because of the subject content. It really is worth watching for anybody. The ending is very powerful - full of unspoken emotions. Ang Lee directed this with tremendous skill. Even if you have a problem with homosexuality, put that to one side and watch this!",10,2,3,15 February 2015
Zodiac," Gripping tense thriller
","One of the most intriguing unsolved serial killer cases of modern times. This movie is full of heavyweight actors who play their parts to the very best of their ability.Even though the movie is quite long, it never lets up. You feel the frustration of everyone involved in trying to solve these crimes. The era of the late 60's and early 70's is very well recreated. The fact that it's based on a true story makes it even more appealing.Years down the line, the police investigation ran out of steam and there wasn't the money or manpower to keep the investigation hot. But Jake G's character from a newspaper kept it going.This movie is the benchmark by which all factual crime dramas should be made. Tense and thrilling - the pace never lets up. If you like this genre of movies, you will love this one!!! Painstaking attention to detail. The story, the clues and the investigation are the real stars of this first rate movie.",10,2,2,26 July 2015
The Hateful Eight," Very good - but not his best.
","If you go to see a Tarantino movie, you have some idea of what to expect - the unexpected!! I did find the first hour somewhat plodding in pace and felt it could have been edited down a tad. But once the real story kicks in, it's kinda like a Tarantino version of an Agatha Christie whodunit. That's not a criticism, just an observation.Samuel L Jackson and Kurt Russell are just superb in their characters - I hope they get nominated for Best Actor come Oscar time. A great cast with a typical Tarantino storyline. If you are a fan of Tarantino, you will love this one too. Everyone can argue which is Tarantino's best movie - I wouldn't dare to suggest that my favorite would be everybody else's.I enjoyed it - but my attention waned a little in the first hour. A good movie that benefits from a large screen! I also agree with one reviewer who says there are political undercurrents in the storyline - I felt that too! But don't let that put you off. I look forward to revisiting this movie in a couple of years. It will always be considered as a Tarantino classic.",8,2,10,10 January 2016
Shutter Island," Could use some editing
","This movie could have been cut by about 30 minutes, and to my mind would have given it better pace and more appeal.The movie took too long to get to the twist at the end - which I admit was pretty good. I did feel there was too much 'filler' in this movie to stretch it out.The acting performances were competent. My personal opinion is that DiCaprio gets terribly miscast at times (e.g. The Aviator), but does well in this role.For me, my attention waned at times but I stuck with it. Was it worth it? I guess so at 7/10!!",7,1,3,24 August 2015
Life of Pi," Take whatever message you like from this movie!!
","This is a great movie on so many levels. For those people who don't want to think too deeply, it's a most enjoyable movie at face value. The special effects are truly amazing - and it takes a lot to impress me in that area. CGI is so overused these days that it rarely makes any impression on me.Ang Lee as the director is truly a master of his craft. His name is up there with all the greats. I now look forward to any movie that he is directing, because you know you will get something very special over and above the script, acting and the visuals.There are plenty of analogies and religious themes, but its not done in a preachy way. Ang Lee lets you decide what you want to take from this engaging story. It's one of those rare movies that you should revisit every few years and see what you get from it.This movie will remain as a classic through the years. If you haven't seen it yet, you really should!",9,1,3,11 August 2015
Interstellar," Too long!
","I like sci-fi movies that expand your mind and make you think a little more. I found this movie frustratingly slow to get going and keep your interest. I just saw it at a dollar theater and am glad I didn't pay full price when it first came out. The basic concept was interesting. The best of the movie is in the last 45 minutes. I have to admit that I was expecting better - I purposely didn't read the IMDb customer reviews beforehand as I didn't want any spoilers or preconceptions. I really wanted to like this movie more, but sadly I didn't. There were so many parts of the story that were hard to follow and understand at times. Obviously from the ratings I'm in the minority. I would say this is a movie for real sci-fi buffs and enthusiasts. Not a bad movie, but not a great one either. But judge for yourself - this is only my opinion.",6,2,6,18 March 2015
Gone Baby Gone," Nearly a ten!!!
","I wanted to give this a 10 for its originality and well crafted movie with lot of twists and turns. It's definitely a 9.5/10. I'm just gonna knock off half a point for just going over the edge of believability.Some stellar performances from Ed Harris, Casey Affleck and the great Morgan Freeman!! Direction by Ben Affleck is superb!!!! The pace was excellent, the storyline never let up - full of tension. One of the rare times where you don't guess the ending. It also has social issues too which leaves questions in your mind!!! This is one of the finest examples of this genre of movies. Well worth watching. I highly recommend it.",9,0,1,28 August 2015
Burn After Reading," Another good'un from the Coens!
","I enjoyed this black comedy. It was done in a style that is trademark Coen brothers!! Brad Pitt and George Clooney both looked like they had a lot of fun with this movie, putting in fine performances. Frances McDormand too, played her part well!!!If you like The Big Lebowski,you will probably enjoy this one too. A great farce. Brad and George seemed to enjoy sending themselves up in their characters. The reaction of George when he shoots a guy is just laugh out loud hilarious!!! Under normal circumstances I would not laugh at any scenario of somebody being shot, but if you watch this movie you'll know why I made that comment.The reactions of the Russian embassy staff and the CIA agents were sheer comedic delight. The movie is a superb send-up of spies and information and attempted cover-ups. If you like quirky movies, then this one is for you!!!",8,1,1,5 July 2015
Cast Away," Much better than I expected!
","I didn't have very high hopes for this movie - boy, how wrong can you be!!! Excellent story and quite believable. Very clever casting of Tom Hanks in the major role - quite possibly, he puts in his finest acting performance of his career. The pace of the movie is excellent. And the time that Tom's character is alone on a small island having to survive is brilliantly portrayed. It was a well thought out story of how somebody might survive. It takes in his darkest moments where he believes the only way out is suicide - and you don't judge him. It makes you start o think what you would do in his circumstances, and I'm sure for most people the option of suicide would cross your mind on more than one occasion. The transition of his life after he does manage to get off the island and get rescued is superbly portrayed. He comes back to a world that is just as lonely even though he's surrounded by people. The closing scene at the crossroads in Texas was just brilliant - the choice of which road to take and how the rest of his life would turn out. If you haven't seen it, then I recommend you do!!",9,0,0,23 May 2015
The Revenant," See it on the big screen!
","Firstly a criticism - it's just a bit too long and realistically you have to suspend belief at DiCaprio's survival in such extreme conditions.But despite that, this is a very good movie and really does benefit from seeing it on the big screen. The locations and cinematography are just absolutely stunning! Good solid story - although quite simple. The acting is top quality. I have no doubt DiCaprio will get the Oscar for his starring role. Don't think the movie will get Best Picture - it's up against stiff competition. I'm in awe of just how this movie was filmed in such conditions!!! The scenes with the bear will leave you breathless and open-mouthed! Undoubtedly one of the best movies of 2015 and deserves your time. If your attention wanes at times, just admire the scenery and locations - that's what I did! I have no hesitation in recommending this movie. It has appeal for all ages and tastes.",9,0,3,15 January 2016
Foxcatcher," A surprisingly good movie!!!
","I can't believe I left it so late to see this one. I'm also amazed that the story - based on actual events - isn't more widely known. Steve Carell puts in a fine acting performance - it's hard at first to take him seriously in a dramatic role, but he does manage to pull it off very convincingly! Both Mark Ruffalo and Channing Tatum also put in great performances as brothers with deep rooted sibling rivalry that rolls into adulthood. All the major players in this movie were mesmerizing and the story line will resonate with many people who have grown up with sibling rivalry. You really feel the pain of Channing's character (Mark Schultz). The movie is somewhat disturbing on some levels, but it is really worth watching. You don't have to be an athlete or a fan of wrestling to enjoy the depth of this movie. If you enjoyed Whiplash, then you will enjoy this - it stirs up similar emotions. I thoroughly recommend this one.",9,1,1,9 April 2015
Beasts of No Nation," Give this movie some credit!!
","I was in two minds about watching this movie - I wasn't sure that the subject matter and location really appealed to me. Boy was I wrong!!! This is a very powerful drama which is totally realistic. Superb acting - especially by the lead young boy Agu. The movie contains some very harrowing scenes - it's not an easy watch, but it is worthwhile.The movie is well directed and gives you plenty of food for thought. It will undoubtedly change your views and opinions on what actually happens in these civil wars in relatively unknown countries and regions of Africa. I'm seeing and understanding things differently now - mostly because of this movie.If you are in two minds about watching this, there are some very eloquent reviews in praise of this movie. I was one of those people. I'm glad I chose to watch it. Very worthwhile.",9,4,4,9 April 2016
Gone Girl," Enjoyable!
","This stands out as a good suspense thriller that keeps you engaged. The movie is paced well. I'm a little surprised that Rosamund Pike is nominated for Best Actress - I didn't think her performance was that worthy - that's not to say it's bad, just not exceptional. Naturally having Ben Affleck as the lead gives this movie a lot more punch and he doesn't disappoint! Certainly deserved the hype it got. When the movie is over and you give it more thought there are a few holes in the storyline but that doesn't matter. It's meant to entertain you and that's what it does. It's not out to change your views or opinions on any subject. Sit back and enjoy it for what it is.",8,2,4,13 February 2015
Drive," What a surprise!
","Somehow managed to miss this one and catch it on late nite TV and I'm really glad I did. This is an atmospheric and stylish action-thriller.If you enjoy movies like No Country For Old Men and 100 Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead, then this one will probably appeal to you too. I loved everything about this movie. There are a number of scenes which require you to squirm.What this movie lacks in dialogue, it makes up for it with sheer style. Think less is more. It takes a superb director to pull off a movie like this. What a great job. You really need to give it your full attention as every scene is worthy of your appreciation and understanding. The storyline in itself isn't that unique, but there's something about this one that really hooks you in. The soundtrack is very stylish too!! I loved everything about it and really can't find fault with it, hence the top rating. Classy movie - and I think I'll buy the soundtrack too.",10,1,1,17 October 2015
The Theory of Everything," A good insight!
","Very good account of the private life of Stephen Hawking and his first wife. The pace of the story flows well. The acting depicts the era very well with the very reserved attitude towards sex by people with this type of background. Stephen Hawking is an incredible man both physically and mentally. His concepts of Physics go way over my head. But the movie doesn't concentrate too much on the scientific side, it's more about their relationship. The make up team have done an incredible job making Eddie Redmayne look like Stephen Hawking! I do have one criticism, and that is I don't feel the movie truly portrayed the difficulty his wife had to take care of him and bring up three children at the same time. Surely, she had more help than was depicted in the movie? Having worked myself with severely physically disabled people, I know just exactly how hard the work is. His first wife deserves a lot more credit than she is given - both in the movie, and in real life.",8,0,0,13 February 2015
2012," Worst disaster movie to date!!!
","Shame on John Cusack for taking on the main role in this movie - must have needed for money!!! The storyline is ridiculous enough, but the CGI is really just laughable. I would like to think this movie was made as a spoof of this genre, but horrifyingly it wasn't!!! Every cliché in the book was featured in this movie - including risking personal life for the sake of a beloved dog!!!The acting is pretty dire from everyone! The movie really is an insult to most people's intelligence and should be avoided at all costs. I thought Jupiter Ascending was bad, but I'm not sure whether this one outdoes that!!!!! Personally I'm not going to waste my time pondering that thought!",1,1,4,22 September 2015
Room," Not as good as I hoped
","The concept was a good one to take on as there have been a number of high profile abduction cases over the past twenty years or so. But I wasn't totally convinced with the script on this one.It was a good effort in showing the psychological problems and scars that the victims are left with. For me, the best part of the movie was the last 15 minutes - they were the most realistic. And the final narration by the young lad was well written - but a five year old wouldn't be that eloquent. The first half of the story based in the room didn't really work well in my estimation.Despite that, all the major players did a fine job, although I wouldn't say Oscar worthy. I wouldn't recommend people to go the movie theater to see this one - you can wait till it comes round on streaming or a movie channel - or Red Box.",5,19,47,20 January 2016
Gran Torino," Better than I expected!
","For some strange reason I avoided this movie for all this time. I presumed it would be a routine movie around the subject of racism with stereotypical characters.I should have known better - as it stars and is directed by the great Clint Eastwood. Admittedly the movie does start out fairly predictably and you kinda think you can guess how the story might pan out.Good performances by all the major players - the goodies and the baddies!!! The thug gang types were very realistic. I do think that Clint's racist character is very in-tune with the 'average' racist in as much as he has preconceived ideas and beliefs about 'recent' foreign immigrants. Clint's character himself is an polish immigrant from many years ago and regards himself as a true American, rather than a Polish immigrant! Worth a watch - it comes round on TV fairly regularly - it is more than just a routine racism movie, it goes a lot deeper.",8,3,7,30 November 2015
The Imitation Game," Well worth seeing!
",This is a totally engaging movie dramatizing the true story of how the ENIGMA code was cracked in the Second World War. Superbly acted by Cumberbatch as Alan Turing. He really got a good handle on the homosexuality of the character as well as the Asperger's condition with the right amount of social awkwardness. A powerful movie on many levels. It makes you realize the outcome of the Second World War was determined quite differently to what the history books tell you. You got the real sense of frustration and anxiety by the crack team and their painstaking efforts to help the forces against Hitler. Turing's life after the war was a sad reflection of less enlightened times about homosexuality. I highly recommend this movie. I would like to see it win Best Picture at the Oscars.,9,3,9,13 February 2015
Everest," Gripping drama
","I have no doubt this movie will pick up a lot of Oscars in the technical categories, but will miss out on acting. That's not to say it's badly acted, but it is the story itself that is so compelling.The soundtrack and cinematography are just amazing! And the 3D IMAX really add to the spectacle of the whole experience.I think you need a combination of courage and madness to take on Everest as it has been the final resting place of many a climber. You are in awe of the majesty of this mountain. Whether you make it or not isn't just dependent on your experience as a climber, you are at the mercy of the elements that can change dramatically within a few hours.You don't have to have an interest in climbing to appreciate this movie. This drama is based on actual events. The pace and direction are very good. You don't learn a whole lot about many of the characters, but they all have the same goal and ambition. I admire their courage, but I like my adrenalin in a controlled environment at Cedar Point, Ohio!!!! If this movie subject appeals to you, it is well worth seeing - and you should also check out the docu-drama Touching The Void!",9,27,49,14 September 2015
Into the Wild," Loved it!
","These are the types of movies that I like the most. Based on a true story - which makes it even more interesting. I have great admiration for this young guy. He followed his beliefs and followed his heart. He had a lot of great experiences along the way. Nothing compares to pushing your boundaries and limits - it is the best life lesson you can have. Kudos to this guy. The pace of the movie and the cinematography are not far short of perfect. I hope his parents and sister are extremely proud of how he lived his life. A great humanitarian who I am certain would have achieved a lot - but not in the materialistic sense. His life has great meaning and sadly for us, it was cut way too short. Movies like this lift the spirit. I did also watch the docu-movie about this young guy which paints a slightly different view of him. I believe the true person lies somewhere in the middle. Well worth watching. I hope it moves you in the same way it did for me!",10,0,2,14 May 2015
2001: A Space Odyssey," Must-see movie
","I really enjoy this movie - it may look slightly dated by today's standards, but remember this was made in 1968 and was ahead of its time back then. The soundtrack is haunting and extremely beautiful. Whilst I am certainly no expert in this genre or field, it leaves you with the impression that you are watching something very worthwhile and potentially life changing. Each time I watch it I get something more from it. The stunning cinematography during the last thirty minutes was the finest from the 60's - and possibly even the 70's! For me the movie promotes a desire to gain more knowledge. I would love to see it in I-Max very late at night. If the evolutionary path excites you, then it is a very worthwhile movie!!! Love it!",9,2,4,21 February 2015
Selma," Very worthy!
","Superbly portrayed account of actual events during a time of great social upheaval in American History. I lived through these times - although too young to appreciate the significance of the events. I can't praise the actor who portrays Dr. M.L. King too highly!! Why isn't he nominated for Best Actor????? Whilst the storyline is an embarrassment to white American history at home, it is also a testament to how far we have come since that time. Of course, we are all aware that there still exists some racial injustices, but things don't change overnight. They take time. We have an African-American president - who would have thought that even ten years ago??? We shouldn't dwell too much on our failures, but look at how far we've come. There's still a lot to do. This is a must-see movie. A great man with great dignity. A true visionary who was sadly taken too soon. I hope when the history of these times are written, full acknowledgment is given to the Motown Record Corporation for its role in strengthening relations between the younger generations of white and black people.",8,1,3,13 February 2015
Love & Mercy," Wanted more from this
","As a fan of the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson in particular, I was eager to see this movie. Brian is a guy with an enormous musical talent. He had quite an abusive upbringing from his father - but in the movie he says that if he hadn't had that amount of discipline from his father, he may never have achieved the greatness that he did.The movie does jump around quite a bit - some people may struggle with that if they don't know their history. What was the final edit, is generally very good and worthwhile. It sympathetically showed Brian's mental struggles alongside his genius. He is a very fragile person but in his own world of music he has some confidence.I wish we got to learn how this creep of a psychotherapist got into Brian's life and was able to take over in the way that he did. I'm just baffled that surviving family members and the band didn't get more involved to stop this getting out of control in the way that it did. There's huge gaps in the story - and maybe that's because Brian himself is unable to fill them himself as there were a number of years where he was barely able to function.The movie will have natural appeal to Beach Boys/Brian Wilson fans, but I'm not sure it will have much appeal to outsiders.I am delighted that Brian has got his life back and is able to perform and write in a way that's comfortable for him. He seems to be at the best place in his head that he's ever been and seems to have a good grasp on reality.Worthwhile but could have been a little better.",7,3,4,13 July 2015
Sicario," Tense thriller
","I appreciate the message of this movie and think the Director has done a pretty good job. It shows the real ugly side of the narcotics industry controlled by powerful cartels.The real tragedy of this business is both the end users (self-inflicted), and the mules who are treated as the lowest form of life and are expendable. And at times, if they step out of line in any way, they sometimes get killed and have their bodies displayed to frighten off any other people who might try to cross the cartels.It's a war for sure. I wish the people who use drugs either for recreational use or through addiction could see for themselves the misery at the source and distribution level. I have a certain amount of sympathy for the cheap mules that are used to get the drugs across the border - they are trying to support their families under very difficult circumstances with poor work prospects. It is a dog eat dog world for those people - that's partly the reason so many of them want to cross the border illegally in the hope of a better life.I wish there were easy answers to this problem from every angle. To be honest, I believe it needs to start with the users - since when have narcotics improved somebody's life? It is somewhat ingrained in American culture, that there is a pill to cure anything we don't like about our lives. People need to come to terms with the fact that most of our problems need to be addressed and acknowledged by ourselves in the first instance.Anyway, I digress. The movie is a good tense thriller and fairly realistic. The acting is good. The Director is obviously a fan of movies like Traffic, The Hurt Locker and American Sniper. Read the synopsis of this movie to see whether it's something you would enjoy. I liked it and would recommend it if the theme appeals to you!",8,0,2,13 October 2015
The Shape of Water," How many nominations does this have?
",The one good thing I will say about the movie - it is well acted. And that's it. The characters are all one dimensional. You have to watch it as a pure fantasy - and it still fails in that category as the story is too formulaic! You know how the story will pan out. I'm incredulous that it has got so many nominations in the major awards - it really doesn't deserve it. It's not a bad movie - but certainly not one of any great worth. I wish I could say better things about it.,4,7,14,4 March 2018
Whiplash," Passionate!
","This movie far exceeded my expectations. You don't need to be a music fan, drummer or any other kind of musician to enjoy this story. Superbly acted, well edited drama. Believable characters. I had no idea J K Simmons was this good - so glad he got the Oscar, it was well deserved. The movie may be too intense for some people, but if you are a person with great passion for something in your life, then this will resonate with you very deeply! I was moved to tears on more than one occasion. On my drive home from the movie theater I was in tears again as I absorbed the passion of this great movie. This goes into my personal top ten favorites. This is a must-see movie!!! If you don't see this one, you are missing out on something very special. Loved it passionately!!!",10,0,2,3 March 2015
The Reader," Good - but not great.
","This is a slow movie and it takes quite a while for you to get drawn in. A lot of people might give up on it for that reason.It is a worthwhile movie with a moving and touching storyline. It is more style than substance though. I did feel somewhat manipulated by the Director to make sure I felt the right emotion at the right time. Despite that, it is a well-crafted.This story does need two heavyweights to act their asses off, and I have no complaints with the casting. From what I am lead to believe the movie is as good as the book.I've read a lot of the reviews and I can see where people are coming from, both good and critical. I would recommend this movie as one to watch.",7,0,0,12 June 2015
Arrival," Am I missing something?
","I was about 30 minutes into this movie when I realized that nothing worthwhile was happening! I wanted so much to enjoy this movie because it sounded like something I would enjoy.As somebody else as commented, it feels like a remake of Close Encounters for adults - and I didn't like that movie either.Some people are articulating the virtues of this movie - I wish I could have seen the movie they saw. I found it boring and slow. It was pretentious, arty and up its own asshole!!! Not much happens!! Yeah, I get the message from the movie about communication - but all of us with half a brain cell know that!!! I really would like to say something more positive, but I can't think of anything good to say! If you are going to the theater to see it, then I hope you get more from it than I did! Waste of time for me.",1,19,38,17 November 2016
The Shawshank Redemption," Too flawed
",This movie is a total piece of manipulation. It does have a few redeeming features though - Morgan Freeman's narration all through is pure art!!! This guy acts with his mouth!!! As a piece of fiction it has some merit and I can see why many people would enjoy it. But to be classed as one of the best movies of all time - really? C'mon!!! Certainly the portrayal of the brutality of the guards during those times I would say is fairly realistic.The one part of the story where an old timer gets released does ring true. There are many people like that who are totally institutionalized and do not have the skill to survive on the outside without a good support network in place.This is a movie for those people who like everything laid out perfectly for them and doesn't require any thinking. Personally I like a bit more depth and reality.I don't want to put people off seeing it - it should be watched once. But for me the flaws outweigh its redeeming features.,3,8,16,8 August 2015
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Great movie!!!
","So much good acting in this movie. Michael Keaton has soared in my estimation. I really would like to see him get the Best Actor at the Oscars for this performance. Emma Stone is also quite remarkable - surely she must get Best Supporting Actress at the Oscars? There are no duff performances by any of the actors. Ed Norton acts to his usual high standard. This movie treats its audience with intelligence. It works on so many levels and probably needs to be seen more than once to fully appreciate everything. It gave me plenty to think about for days after seeing the movie. I will definitely see it again in the near future. I would recommend this to anyone who is a real movie lover, but watch it when you've got the time to sit and absorb it fully.",9,3,8,13 February 2015
The Big Short," Good factual story
","Well directed movie which tried to explain the collapse of the USA financial market which rippled its way round the world into a global depression. The movie was careful to explain some of the jargon to us in a way that's reasonably easy for us to understand. But this isn't a movie for everyone - it has limited appeal.It's too simplistic to put all the blame at the door of the big banks – but they do deserve a major chunk of the blame. The SEC and the Ratings Agencies share an equal amount of blame for allowing this situation to become the monster that it did. It's a fact of life that in any disaster, there are winners as well as losers.Capitalism does have its faults – make no mistake. But for now there isn't a better option. It is evolution at work. It's natural and right for all of us to want to better ourselves. But once greed rears its ugly head, then it gets nasty. As always, it's the have-nots that suffer the most – losing their jobs and struggling to keep a roof over their heads through no fault of their own. That's the reality and sadness of the whole situation.It is horrendous that very few people were brought to answer for their actions – there was definite criminal activity. There were many people who weren't doing their jobs correctly in order to have prevented this debacle. Sadly, white collar crime isn't treated quite as seriously as all other crimes of theft and fraud by poorer people. But we all have some blame to bear. If we didn't give all our money to the Investment bankers looking for the best return on our dollar, then these situations wouldn't be as dramatic as they were. Society as a whole has to bear some blame too.I did struggle a bit towards the end with exactly what was happening with these Investors and their funds, but just about hung on. Not enough emphasis was put on the real sufferers – the lower class poor public. People who lost their jobs because the banks collapsed and loans and investments to small businesses dried up. That's the REAL story. Even today people are still suffering from the after effects. It's a dog eat dog world – make no mistake.I did like the fact that a lot of the events were based on actual events. Superbly acted and well directed. A very good effort. I was somewhat surprised that others in the theater laughed out loud when some of the characters used profanities in the workplace while at tense meetings....c'mon, grow up people - it's not funny to hear people use the F-word. It was used in context of a serious situation and because of the urgency of what was happening in the financial world. The people laughing were adults - not just College kids! Grow up. The words were there as a part of the reality - not for laughs!",7,0,0,22 January 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," I just don't get it
","Firstly, I have to admit that I'm a Star Wars virgin! I have never seen any of the previous movies. I didn't go to see this for myself, I took a young man with learning difficulties for a fun activity. For the most part, it held his attention. As for me – well, I just don't see the appeal of the movie for adults. Sure it's great for under 15's and wouldn't dream of knocking them for their enjoyment! I found the storyline too formulaic – and there are more holes in it than a moth eaten blanket! The special effects are just adequate – nothing new or ground-breaking. The screenwriters didn't exactly have to work hard on this one!! Pretty much, it's the good guys versus the bad guys and generally the good guys win out – for the time being!! Needless to say, the movie leaves plenty of scope for a plethora of sequels. And all the time there are youngsters out there, they will lap it up!! I know some adults go because of taking their kids – that's fine!! But I seriously have to wonder about adults that go for their own enjoyment. Maybe I'm just getting old.I've rated this a three – and not from my personal enjoyment, but for the effort that has been put in for its intended audience. I feel they have been somewhat cheated by a mass produced franchise. It's the McDonald's of the movie world.",3,37,44,17 January 2016
Deadpool," Surprisingly, I loved it!!!
","I avoided this movie when it was in the theaters, but recently I was on a long haul flight and watched this movie. I thought I would probably give up on it after 30 minutes and move on to another selection! This isn't the sort of movie I would normally watch but I'm so glad that I did. Ryan Reynolds played his part beautifully - he's good in comedy, I love his dry sense of humor!! The special effects were spectacular, and there was a reasonable story-line to follow. I was enthralled from start to finish. One minor criticism - the overuse of bad language - had it been used less it would have been more effective and have more impact.If you're like me and avoid all kind of superhero movies, give this one a go. It really is better than you probably imagine. The consistent foul language is a bit of turn off, but apart from that, it's an enjoyable spoof and send up of this genre. I have no hesitation recommending this movie.",9,2,7,4 June 2016
Donnie Darko," This is a genuine great cult movie
","If you haven't seen the movie and are reading reviews to see whether you'll like it, then read the best reviews first.It is a complex movie which really needs to be seen more than once to take it all in. It leaves you with more questions than answers. Jake G is stunning as the complex Donnie character.If you like your movies clear cut with a beginning, middle and end, then this one is probably not for you. It's a movie for thinkers and those who don't see everything as black or white. If you enjoy movies like Birdman, Paris Texas and Fisher King, there's a good chance you'll enjoy this one. Every scene is worthy of study and interpretation.I loved it for its quirkiness and originality. Read the 10/10 reviews to get a better insight of the content of the movie - some of those reviews are very eloquent. Hope you enjoy the movie as much as I did!",9,0,2,26 July 2015
The Martian," Well done!!!!
","I wondered whether this movie would be able to live up to the hype and I'm pleased to say it sure did from my point of view.I think Matt Damon was perfect as the lead in this sci-fi/sci-fact gem. I did find the story very believable for the most part.I have some minor concerns over the casting of some roles - in particular Sean Bean. If you need a Brit accent, you can find someone with much better acting skills (and accent too!!!). But as he's in a smaller role, it doesn't detract from the good points of this movie.It appears to me that a lot of thought went into the geographical locations and probably some input from NASA to give the movie authenticity.I saw the movie in 3D and was pleased with the effects. If you enjoyed Gravity, I think you will enjoy this even more. It's a long movie, but well worth sitting through. Personally I really enjoyed the whole concept and the well crafted story. The pace was good. It worked for me.I feel sure this will get a few nominations in the Oscars - I'd vote for Matt Damon as Best Actor.",10,10,30,5 October 2015
