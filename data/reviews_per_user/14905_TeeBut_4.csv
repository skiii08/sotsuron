The Blair Witch Project," Just let it SCARE you!!!
","No more commentary is required. If you REALLY want to go and experience one of the most terrifying moments of your cinematic life, do the following :1. Clear your mind of all the bad reviews that you've heard about the film, as these people are just unaware of what is is to actually be scared (unlike the crap that you get with the likes of Urban Legend, and I Know What You Did Last Summer)2. Go into the cinema with the thought in your head that you want to get scared, and the film will take you 10,000 times past that point, into your own personal nightmare.3. If you put yourself in their position, and allow yourself to be drawn into the film, The Blair Witch Project will reward you with the fright of your life!!!ENJOY!!!",10,1,2,28 February 2000
"Monsters, Inc."," Perfect!!!
","Yet again, Pixar Animation Studios have given us a treat of a film with 'Monster Inc'. The little girl is absolutely gorgeous, and both the out-takes at the end, and the short film at the start, are worth the price of admission on their own.Enjoy!",9,0,1,6 February 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Just enjoy it
","Steve Soderbergh has taken a complete turn of events from his Erin Brockovich & Traffic days, and gone back to the style and fun of 'Out of Sight' with Ocean's Eleven. All I'll say is go in there, expect to be 'entertained', and you'll enjoy the two hours that pass.",8,0,0,6 February 2002
The Green Mile," Another senstional adaption by Frank Darabont
","I won't waste too much of your time, as you'll need it to see The Green Mile. But at just over three hours, it is one of the most moving pictures that you will come across in quite some time. Not one minute drags on, the storyline/s flow together beautifully, and the acting of Michael Clark Duncan (John Coffey) is absolutely tremendous. 10 out of 10!!!",10,0,1,28 February 2000
