The Benchwarmers," Very Bad
","I have to admit when I saw the previews that I was not going to find the movie funny. Of course I was dragged to the theater and sat through 1 hour and 25 minutes that I will never get back. The movie aims towards the pre-teen area of population. The movie was made of cheap laughs, painful hits, with a little bit of adult humor. I was a little surprised to see that people enjoyed the movie. It was a complete bore. I expected a whole lot more from the comedic actors! The only thing that I found hilarious was that they made Rob S. the hero(for the most part). The movie itself is a lesson. So I'll give it to you to save your time, don't be mean to nerdy kids and don't pay to see this movie!",1,5,12,7 April 2006
