The Rock," Michael Bay's best (as of yet)
","Well here is part two of a great director's, work. This is a truly great film (almost perfect!!), among the best ones ever made. Good cast, story, effect, laughs and so on, but what really struck me here was how great Michael Bay is. This film made me almost cry several (5) times. Bad Boys and Armageddon made me almost cry to, well I even did during Armageddon and that is rare in an action flick. This almost cry thing' is due to Michael Bays directing style of course (colours, slow motion) plus the great sound he uses during the scenes. Almost cry scenes in this film were: the shower  room, Hummel' s speech at the beginning and the green flares. Michael Bay and The Rock ROCK!!!! Michael Bay is going to get gigantic over the years I SWEAR and he will be someone in the lines of Spielberg someday. Why am I so sure, well I downloaded the Pearl Harbor Teaser (due out Memorial Day 2001) and I almost cried, it was great, brilliant. This one will follow Michael Bays other successes: (Bad Boys (1995): $ 140,8 Million World - wide, The Rock (1996): $ 330,5 Million World  wide, Armageddon (1998): $ 554, 6 Million World  wide and Pearl Harbor (2001): $ 750 Million World  wide????? (WHY???, because every movie in this line  up adds about $ 200 Million to the box  office result of the movie before)), but not only in the box  office field (Bad Boys (1995): 0 Oscar nominations, The Rock (1996): 1 Oscar nomination, Armageddon (1998): 4 Oscar nominations and Pearl Harbor (2001): will win 1 Oscar and be nominated for ??? others (WHY???, I don't know, just guessing!!!!!))RENT IT!!!!!!!

The Devil's Advocate," Weird flick, you make my heart tick
","This is really a weird film, trust me. I mean I've seen a couple of strange films but never have I seen such a strange one yet. That probably originated in me thinking that this would be a film about a lawyer in the style of The Firm, you know I thought it was about a young lawyer making the big hit in the city and all the problems that arise there. I had seen the commercials on TV a few years back and I was under the impression that it was about a lawyer who moves to the city and starts an affair there and gets in trouble later due to the adultery he committed. MAN I was wrong, never have I been so wrong in my life. But that being wrong' was also encouraged by the Video Store I rented it in. It said there right on the side that it was a thriller and not like a science fiction movie or something. I know this isn't genuine science fiction, but hell this ain't a genuine thriller either. I don't know what this was man, I don't know and that has never happened to me before.
The question now is really was I disappointed, HELL no, it was a good film really. OK when Charlize Theron started freaking out I was like: What is this man?' but then I started getting into it and I must really say the performances helped a lot too. Keanu Reeves was good. Charlize Theron and Connie Nielsen, they were good too (really). What about Pacino??? Well, Al Pacino, he was fu..ing great. He was like, damn I have never seen him so good, he was pure evil and that made you believe he was the character he portrayed. He was just the best one in the whole picture great performance, I would have liked to have seen some kind of nomination or award for that role.
Although I know and feel it was a bit of a strange film, I liked it still, because it had all the elements that a good film needs, it had a good story, a good cast, good direction and of course enough excitement not to lose appeal, for it was like 144 minutes long. That's 2 hours and 22 minutes. The film was just built up in the best possible way. You really started thinking during the film and it all was kept really tasty, so it would not get too cheap and gory. Those last things were not needed too for the actors and the story were good and it was not some Urban Legend 3: This is really the Final Cut people, plus it is the best one yet'. 
Of course with a film like this and the actors involved there are bound to be some excellent scenes and believe me there were some. My favourite two are the whole ending with the Reeves  Pacino confrontation and of course the scene with the broken mirror (I don't want to spoil anything but that was the best scene of the sort I have ever seen).
At last there is only one more thing I want to say to all of you, if you don't know what I mean with this being a strange film, let me put it like this, it reminded me a lot of Rosemary's Baby, but it was like million times better. Let's say it like this, this is the kind of movie I expected to see when I started watching Rosemary's Baby. Still don't know what I mean? Rent The Devil's Advocate then and do it fast.

Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The Tarantino Pentathlon Part 5 - The temporary end of his return: Kill Bill Vol. 2
","The sentimental showdownKill Bill Vol. 2 deserves to be another film than Kill Bill Vol. 1, not only the fact that the film would then run 4 hours + if it had been shown in one piece, but more because showing both films in one run might come across somewhat odd. The reason I'm saying this, is because Kill Bill Vol. 2 is very different in tone and feeling than was Vol. 1. The first part was more anger driven and brutal, whereas Kill Bill Vol. 2 is more about love and disappointment. Where the first part is bloody and ruthless, the second one is tender and sore. This does not mean that there is no brutality in this film, but rather that the tone of the film is totally different.
I must admit that it took me some getting used to in the first 20 or so minutes of the film, because I'd expected the film to go on as brutally and furious as the first one finished. It didn't happen. What I got instead was a more story and character driven film, that was filled with emotion, explanations and some good and original fighting scenes.
I have no negative comments on this film I guess. I think the acting was good to very good, with the extra kudos going to Daryl Hannah, who'd let some people to believe that she as just a tall blond who couldn't act in the last couple of years. With this film she manages to show us though, that she just has not been given the right offers. This I must say seems to be some kind of quality of Tarantino, to get Â‘discarded' actors and actresses and give them an opportunity to shine once again. Speaking of Tarantino, although I do realize that with Kill Bill he was an 'hommage' to many of his influences, I just have to say that he is a great director and screenwriter. I mean, the way he directs, the music he chooses to accompany the scenes and the dialog. It's just all top notch. This does not mean that this is the best film I've ever seen, but that it is a good film, which fulfilled it's promises. I mean let us ALL be honest. Who can pull off filming a revenge movie lasting more than 4 hours without it getting dull and boring? NOBODY but Tarantino. Hell, most people can't make complete a good 90 minute flick with this amount of story.

Mission: Impossible III," Impossible? I wish....
","Well I'd really hoped for an Impossible Mission this time around, but I fear I didn't get it. Msiion Impossible II is just more of the same old 'you win some, you lose some' twine that usually see in action films. Sure the action is good, but with all that talent (Rhames, Hoffman and Fishburne) J.J. Abrans & Co. could have created a much more subtle, an emotionally deeper film. The first thing to irritate was actually the intro. The title music felt much too sharp after what had happened earlier. The film had very good moments as well though. Actually everything that had Rhames, Hoffman or Fishburne in it was great. Hoffman was totally under-used as the bad guy and as far as Tom Cruise was concerned. Anybody could have pulled his 'acting' off I guess. What I am getting at is that M:I III is what M:I II should have been like. A follow-up that tries to focus on a story and not effects-only. Too bad it comes 6 years too late, too bad great talent was under-used and too bad that it is too predictable at times.7 out of 10",7,1,3,5 May 2006
Requiem for a Dream," An OK movie, with a great ending
","To be honest, Requiem for a Dream is not a great movie. Especially in the beginning it is very weird at times and one cannot really say that it is exciting or entertaining. What one can say with certainty though, is that it is at all times interesting and that it remains above mediocrity at all times. The sad thing about this film is, that the distortions our addict friends' go through, do not always work in the films pace and sometimes they do the film more wrong than right. What makes this otherwise only' OK movie, worth watching in the end though, is a great and disturbing finale, which will make you remember this film for a long time after you have seen it. In the case of Requiem for a Dream, the ending definitely made the film, which as a whole might be an interesting character study for some and possibly great prevention for anyone who thinks about taking drugs. If you like these kind of films I can recommend Bully and Irreversible to you, which I thought were both better than this one. But then again, you could also try Memento, which is even more over-rated on IMDB, than this film. Requiem for gets a Dream 8,5 out of 10 ranking at # 46 and Memento gets a 8,7 ranking at # 14 in the IMDB top 250. My guess is that these two films are that high in the top 250, because the ending of a film, is the last thing you see and the endings of those films really stick around in your head and in Requiem's case it is really a top notch ending. But people, let us NOT forget that the rest wasn't too great and that a great ending alone does not make a great film.

Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The mind that brought us the movie that changed HOLLYWOOD finally shows us the beginning of his world - famous and brilliant brainchild
","Every saga has it's beginning and The Phantom Menace is IT. Now this was a highly anticipated movie as most of you will surely know. Maybe even the most anticipated ever. People were going to the Theatre, expecting to see the best movie they've ever seen and of course some were disappointed, others weren't. The disappointed ones then trashed the movie on the Internet and gave it bad reviews, as did the critics, who never ever really loved a Star Wars movie, or did they?Everybody, noticing anything about this movie, good or bad, compares it to the 2nd (First released) trilogy, which is totally understandable, I think. But you just can't compare it, because you know all 3 movies of the 2nd trilogy and that makes you see that trilogy as a hole and not as three movies, who stand on their own feet. Of the 1st trilogy, you know only the beginning after having seen The Phantom Menace and that is very different. Also when you are going to watch the picture you must make yourself clear that it will be in a total different way  than you did the 2nd trilogy. Most of you readers didn't view the original trilogy on the big screen in the 70's and 80's I presume and  nor have I. But I can assure you, many of the viewers probably went out of the theatre with the same feelings I did coming out of The Phantom Menace which is a feeling of not being completely satisfied. This is, because the story has to continue and WILL.Another point of criticism to this movie is that many people say the first Star Wars movie had more of an epic feeling to it than this one and I have to say, that's TOTALLY true, but this is the beginning folks. You know, you should regard the 9 episodes of Star Wars as a 3 hour lasting movie, in which every trilogy covers an hour. Now it is totally natural, that the first hour is merely an introduction and not by far as epic as the middle of the movie. Or do you know a movie without introduction, that moves right into the epic feeling or do you know a movie in which the introduction itself is really cool and after that it even gets cooler? Also you'll have to adjust to the new actors and actresses. You are used to see Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (CarrieFisher), Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Vader and many others. But now you'll have to focus on Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman), young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), young Obi Wan (Ewan McGregor), Qui Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and of course much hated Jar Jar Binks. I have to say, that although I had to get used to the new performers I found it pretty easy. Everyone was watchable, although I didn't like Samuel L.Jackson that much in his role and Obi Wan got a little too little attention. This however will change as the story goes on.I really liked Liam Neeson, REALLY surprised me. The performances of Lloyd and Portman were good also, although I liked Lloyd a bit better, Obi Wan was also OK. I also liked Darth Maul pretty much and I didn't find Jar Jar Binks an annoying guy at all. He actually brought in a little fun. The other cast was good also, like Shmi Skywalker, Sebulba, R2 - D2 and C - 3PO. Of course the movie is a little more childish, but hey, there are children in the movie, you know and it's a bit of a teenage flick, so what's to grumble of a little bit of childishness. The special effects are astounding (OSCAR!!!!), although I didn't like all the creatures. And I also didn't like all the scenes, but hey nobody's perfect, not even THE Great LUCAS. The music by Williams is good (OSCAR nomination), as always, but I liked the music during the last lightsaberduel, between Neeson and Park best. That music was teriffic. The fight itself was beautyfully choregraphed by the way (Hong Kong style you might as well say). This part of the movie had a little bit of that much missed epic feeling.So I think the future of Star Wars (Episodes II and III) are in the hands of very well acting Portman and also very well acting McGregor and L.Jackson who I think doesn't really fit, but who knows what'll happen in the next 2 Episodes and what I'll be saying in 6 years. It'll be good of course, like this one, on which I had not much comment as you may have noticed. I even liked it so much that I'm going to see it again when it comes to our little HELLHOLE town for 10 guilders (5 bucks), because going to what is considered the BIG TOWN here, about 25 kilometres away from here is too expensive to me ($ 7,50 for the flick and another $5 for travelling and probably even more for consumptions) If you think about watching the Phantom Menace remember, do NOT expect too much, look at it as a new episode (that's what it is) and don't compare it too much to the 2nd trilogy. You'll definitely like it if you do that, just trust me or sue me if you didn't like it.MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU, ALWAYS!8/10",8,0,2,11 October 1999
The Sound of Music," Not too bad for a musical
","I'm no fan of musicals, but I do not hate them either (I thought Moulin Rogue! rocked and I thought The Rocky Horror Picture Show kin of sucked). Well this is somewhere in between. I dislike all the merry singing in this film, really and I do not think that Julie Andrews is too good either, but there are some things I do really enjoy. I thought Christopher Plummer did a great job, especially in the beginning when he was still unhappy. I could really laugh at those grimaces he made. The parts of the story I like most are from when Maria (Julie Andrews) starts working at the von Trapp house until she leaves (mostly though the scenes with Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer) and the part from the return of Capt. von Trapp returns from his honeymoon until the end. The rest is too merry and uninteresting. The movie is a bit too long as well, but heck it is not bad.

Catch Me If You Can," Falsely categorized
","One thing that strikers me at IMDB is that the films there always carry so many genre titles. Catch me if you can is one of them. Virtually every category that was ever invented is listed, despite the fact that this is clearly what we (in Dutch) would call a speelfilm' or a spielfilm' in German. I do not know if there is a translation for it in genre' terms, but it roughly means motion picture'. You see this is just the story of a young fraud with not too much adventure, thrills or drama in it although featuring a lot of crime.
I think that after this film, there will be a time of quiet surrounding Steven Spielberg, because it is the way he's done it previously. Hook (1991), Jurassic Park (1993) and Schindler's List (1993), then taking a 4 year break from making movies; Amistad (1997), The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) and Saving Private Ryan (1998), then taking a 3 year break and now AI (2001), Minority Report (2002) and Catch me if you Can (2002) making a ??? year break I presume. Why do I make this list you wonder well, I do it to make a point. The point is, that I think that Spielberg will take a bit of a break now and that I think he needs one, because the last films he has made weren't really good. I mean you obviously cannot keep making Schindler's List's or Jurassic Park's but there is something missing lately in Spielberg's work. I miss that feeling that I'm watching the films of someone who never stopped being a small child and I miss the feeling. I mean let's face it, in AI Spielberg tried to insert that dreamy side of himself, but it failed because the Spielberg ending did not fit the Kubrick story, then there came Minority Report which proved that Spielberg is not the best in making thrilling crime movies and now there is Catch me if you Can a film that has a pretty nice story, but also a film that is neither good nor bad. It is entertainment, in it's most normal form and nothing one would assume to have been made by Spielberg. It's not as if I'm not happy with the choices that he makes, but I feel that he could bring more feeling into his film. One could have felt more involved, the film could have been more dramatic and more moving. What happened Mr.Williams' great scores (I know he got an Oscar nomination, but I cannot remember one bit of film, where the music stuck out). This film is just not Spielberg's territory and it shows, for it is not as outstanding and memorable as his other work. Spielberg's territories clearly are adventure (JP, Indiana), Drama (Color Purple, Amistad, Schindler's List) and Family films (Hook, E.T.) and maybe he could even pull off dark film like AI if he didn't try to convert it in a fairy tale at the end.

One Hundred and One Dalmatians," Probably the worst' film I've seen from Disney's animated department
","One hundred and one Dalmatians may be a classic' animated film, according to the package it comes in, but I personally felt that there were too many things missing to even call this memorable. First of all the animation was not good (especially if you compare it to Snow White which dates back from 1937) and second of all the story was not that compelling. It was not very thrilling and it was neither as charming nor as funny as I am used of most Walt Disney's animated features. It could certainly be me, but I wasn't moved or charmed by all that puppies at all. I mean they had no real depth and I did not get any chance to grow to like them, before or during their captivity. Despite that this is not total rubbish though. The pacing is adequate and it does not get boring. The thing is, that this is just not up to Walt Disney's standards. I liked Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs much better and therefore recommend you watch that film instead if you want to see a Disney classic. But hey I am a grown up and if you want to start your kids on Disney animation, I guess this is one you can start with. If you just want to see the story of those cute little dogs I suggest you watch 101 Dalmatians or 102 Dalmatians (both live action). I enjoyed both of these films more than this animated classic'.

Minority Report," Another mind-buster from the Sci Fi king
","This film, set in 2054, has at it's base nothing more than an ordinary crime situation sort of speak. A cop is supposed to be a murderer. But what really makes this film interesting is that he has not committed it yet. Because of three persons, called Precogs, the police is able to see into the future and prevent murders before they are even committed. The chief of the unit that prevents the murders, Anderton (Tom Cruise) finds himself in a predicament one day, as he sees himself kill another man in the future. Not believing he would be able to do such a thing, he thinks it is a conspiracy and flees from the law to solve his own case. From here on Philip K.Dick (the mentioned king of sci fi) takes us (together with Spielberg and the screenwriter) on an incredible journey which is never predictable (except for the very end of the crime). The series of events are sometimes so surprising, that it reminded me of another film based on Philip K.Dick material: Total Recall. But back to this film. Overall, I felt that the second half of the film was much better than the first, which really was not too special at all. It seems to me, that there are not too many films that can hold and grasp your total being and keep it excited for two and a half hours. Is this film good? Is it bad? It is neither, but it is definetely a step up for Spielberg after A.I. Not a must see, but if you're into science fiction and well crafted stories, give this one a try.

Finding Neverland," Imagining Neverland
","Finding Neverland is a film that relies as much imagination in the viewer as does J.M. Barrie's classic tale Peter Pan itself, if not more, since we are basically told to believe what we have seen is real. The critical viewer will certainly know that he must not take the 'Inspired by a true story' so serious as to believe that everything that happened in the film did happen in reality, but besides some minor points the film manages to be quite believable. I must warn though, that some people, who do not like the fantasy genre might not like this movie, since there are some 'imaginative' scenes in it. I myself (a huge fan of Star Wars and the like) must admit that I struggled with the element of fantasy in this film the first time it was introduced. As the movie preceded though, I got sucked into an imaginative state and I got carried away by the magic of the film.Now it might seem that everything in this film is magic and sweet, but there is also some drama and some harsh reality in this film, which makes it a somewhat extraordinary mix of a film. Some elements are really childlike and could be passed off as a film for kids up to 14 or so, while other themes (especially in the ending) will not be of interest or might not be suitable for some children up to that age. I could relate very good to the adult as well as to the immature (childish) themes of the movie and therefore enjoyed the movie very much. Some might argue that the film is overly sweet and sentimental, but I didn't feel that way. Sure the ending is somewhat sentimental, but it is not soap-opera sentimental and I did not feel that the director tried to milk out every possible tear in the audience by extending every scene in the end beyond what was necessary to convey it's last message. I mean after seeing this it is obvious that at least one scene could have been much longer ;) (not spoiling things here I hope)!!! I don't know what else to say about this film, except that I felt that it was a success on all fronts. The directing was good (I thought Mr.Forster did a better job on this one that he did on Monsters Ball), the music was good and the acting was just great! Johnny Depp was good as ever, although I felt that he was better in last year's Pirates of The Caribbean (probably due to the fact that the latter had a weaker cast overall). I still think he deserves an Oscar nod though. What to say about Kate Winslet then (despite mentioning (again) that I have a thing for her)??? I thought she was good as well, although I felt that she had a lot more character development in The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and that she should win the Oscar for that latter performance. As far as the rest of the actors are concerned, they all did a good job except for one: Freddie Highmore!!! Yes, you got that right. The boy that played Peter. He completely blew me away. I mean Í sort of expected good acting (since Winslet, Depp and Hoffman were cast) but I never expected this little fellow to be as great as he was. The new Osment? Well, no! I hate that sort of comments. But definitely a promising young actor and I'll look forward to seeing him with Depp again in Charlie and the chocolate Factory.8 out of 10 post scriptum: I guess Hoffman will get an Oscar nod, he deserves it",8,2,4,10 December 2004
Erin Brockovich," Julia Roberts' best performance ever? Sorry, NO!
","Many people have said this film contains Julia Roberts' best screen performance ever and I must say I do not agree with that. I do not agree, because it kind of insinuates Julia has been doing crap out there on the big screen for years and that definitely is not true. What is true though is that Julia Roberts is an actress that brings really every character to the screen and the viewer as realistic possible and therefore she is always believable. The only difference with this film however is, that this is not a lighthearted comedy like Notting Hill, but a real life drama that calls for artistic acting instead of just an easy' romantic / comedy performance. That is also the reason I feel that this movie might actually get Roberts an Oscar nomination for best actress, because characters like this fall better with the critics than the characters she played in Notting Hill, My best Friend's Wedding or The Runaway Bride, for the critics seem to think that being able to be believable is not as much of an achievement, but rather having depth and strength and character is. That Oscar nomination I mentioned, could it be endangered though by the amounts of profanity in this picture? I hope not and I do not believe so, for if the critics would also react on profanity, where would Pulp Fiction have gotten? That profanity is one thing I liked too, I mean never have I seen such an adorable b..ch' on the screen. I mean you just have to love Brokovich (Roberts), for she is so true and right out and says whatever she wants, whenever she wants to whoever is in the room in her, it wouldn't matter if it were the Pope or the President of the USA. Oscar nomination, that's all I'm talking about, well will she win it? NO! And why not? Because she is too big a star, look at Carrey and Willis. Well what about Hanks you say. Well Hanks is a different story, he is known to star in films that require acting and he got famous with those acting roles, like in Philadelphia, Forrest Gump and so on. Plus his comedy's never were as kitschy' as Roberts'. But as long as Meryl Streep or Kate Winslet are not out there, to get the Oscar Roberts' has a good chance. On and on I go about Roberts' great performance (again), but what about the other great performance I saw, coming from Albert Finney, who plays Roberts' boss. He was great too, but you know it was not all his achievement, just as Roberts' greatness was not all her achievement. The two just were unbeatable as a screen couple' and if there were prices for best on screen duo's they'd win them all, but since there is no such award I know (almost) for sure that Finney will win the Oscar. A few other Oscars the film will get or be nominated for are Best screenplay, Best Director and Best film (first one is a winner, the others are losers). But you know that's only how I think it will be and my opinion is not a good one to believe, since I thought Shakespeare in Love sucked big time and it got so many awards. But I am pretty optimistic, for I have not seen such a good artistic' movie this whole year. I mean it may not be fast paced or so, but it holds your attention and it is not too dramatic despite the fact that it is based on a true event which took place not even so many years ago and that is what I really liked also about this film. You really have to see this if you like these kinds of movies, whether you like Roberts or not, for her part is unlike anything she has ever played before cause I have never seen Pretty Woman' (sorry Mrs. Roberts) yell and curse like this before. No more nice girl, now it is tough, single, 3 children raising woman who knows what she wants and also how to get it so I suggest we stop calling Mrs. Roberts Pretty Woman', for there is so much more to her to all of you who didn't notice that after seeing The Pelican Brief, Sleeping with the Enemy, Flatliners, Conspiracy Theory, Mary Reilly or Stepmom. If this one can't convince you of Julia Roberts' acting quality a gun to your head couldn't do it!8 out of 10",8,2,9,14 December 2000
Meet the Parents," Way better than Analyze This
","Well I'm not going to make this another neverending comment, but I'll make it short. This is a god comedy and to those expecting very idiotic scenes because of Ben Stiller, you are right, there are some, but not enough to spoil the film, which is almost everything a love comedy should be. This is a good one, so go and see it. Oh yes, do not make the same mistake I did. I really laughed my ass off watching this one and I actually forgot it in the theater (very funny, I know (this is how stupid this film is sometimes)).

Mulan," Great
","This is really a Disney classic and one of the best Disney films I've seen recently (The Emperor's New Groove was something of a disappointment, though I haven't seen Atlantis and Monsters Inc. yet). This film is really funny, something that is mostly due to Eddie Murphy. You know I do not like most of his post 1990 stuff too much, except maybe Metro and The Nutty Professor II, but when he lends his voice for an animated film (like this one or Shrek) it is almost poised to be great.

Se7en," 7 deadly sins
","This is one of the best thrillers I've seen and I've seen quite a few. You might say I'm an actual serial killer freak. This one sure is one of the best, it ranks right up there with other thrillers like Scream, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Blair Witch Project, Copycat, Arlington Road and Fight Club (if you miss Silence of the Lambs, well I can't remember that film so good so I just left it out). The only film that is actually relevant here, because of the serial killer content is of course Copycat. I wouldn't say these two films are even (considering quality), hell no Se7en is better, but hey I must mention Copycat here, because that film featuring Sigourney Weaver was released in 1995 also and I feel it has been neglected or maybe just overlooked by some due to the big success Se7en was. If you like Se7en you'll like Copycat, because it is about a killer, who well copy's famous serial killers.
Now finally on to the film in question. I feel like there is nothing much to be said about this film that already someone said or has written on this page. Still I must comment on it. For one thing I must do so, because this film features some of the best actors there are today and it also is original. First the actors, we have of course heart throb Brad Pitt as you might call him, well I call him one of the best actors of our time. He has done some really good films and by that I don't mean his older ones like Legends of the Fall or A River runs through it, no I mean this one, Fight Club (very good, very underrated) and maybe Thelma & Louise. In this film he delivers a good performance nothing too fancy but good. Especially in the ending I must say, for that part was his hardest. Good acting but not Oscar stuff. Then of course there is Morgan Freeman (see The Shawshank Redemption, Kiss the Girls and Outbreak), who is good too, as most of the time, when there is a job to be done he does it. And now for the best one yet, Kevin Spacey (whose best films are Outbreak, The Usual Suspects, A Time to Kill, The Negotiator, American Beauty and maybe The Ref), who is not that much on  screen but if he is, damn. What a great actor. You might not think this when watching the film the first time except maybe at the very end. But if you watch the film a second time and have remembered the ending (you are probably asking yourselves if can you forget it, well I've done so once but now I've seen it three times and I'll never forget I think) you have to listen closely to the conversation in the car. The way Spacey talks and what he says, it makes so much more sense' when you know the ending. He is just so confident and already teasing men who don't think he is superior when he knows he is, for he has all the aces right up his sleeve. This brings me right up to the originality of this film actually. It is not only that the films story is very original, because never have I seen somebody kill people in connection with the 7 deadly sins. It is also original in the way they are carried out and that is what makes this film really special. The killings are not only brutal, but they are well prepared, so we are dealing with a genius of a madman, something that becomes very clear at the end and not until then, maybe. I think that you actually have to like this movie you must like it unless maybe it is too gory for you. If it isn't you'll like it, trust me.

The Big Lebowski," Every once in a while I see a film with a good vote..
","that I think to be nothing more than a piece of crap. This is one of those films. You Pulp Fiction was about nothing, but it was interesting nothing, whereas this is about really nothing and it sucks at it. This film is neither funny, nor exciting, nor anything that represents a state of entertainment. This film sucks. I'll never understand it's rating a 7,7 ????!!!!. I think the reason for the rating is that it was made by the Coen brothers. Why they get so much good ratings for their films? Hell I don't know. I though this was crap. Fargo was only average. And O brother, where art thou was pretty good. Nothing to make a fuss about (in a good way) was ever made by the Coen brothers.

Monster," Pretty good, yet lacking
","This film, is pretty good, owing most of course to the intriguing story and the great acting of all involved (in particular that of Charlize Theron). For me though, the film holds a couple of flaws as well though. First of all, I find the end and the way Wuornos is picked up in the end a bit hard to believe, with regards to her suspicious nature towards depicted throughout the film. Also, the film could have shown more of the trial of Aileen. Maybe it is, because I am a psychology student, but in my mind (judging from the portrayal of Theron of course) this woman was mentally ill. Therefore I would have liked to hear some expert testimonies. Additionally I would have liked to know how many people she killed and in what time-frame etcetera. Another thing that wasn't cleared up in the film was: 'What 'old thing' was she arrested for???' I mean, there remain numerous questioned unanswered by the film. Those who want the answers to these and all other questions check out: http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/women/wuornos/1.html?sect=11The fact that I found so many downsides to this film (in my opinion) might make it sound as if I didn't enjoy the film. This is not true. I found it heart-breaking and heart-warming at times and thought it was a pretty good movie (I did NOT regret hiring it). Yet I felt that for this movie to be GREAT, to be A CLASSIC, it would have had to be made different. Telling more of Aileen's story and not just implying some things along the way without clearing them up. Also it could have been more informative. But still, with the great acting and because it never got boring it gets a...7 out of 10",7,3,6,20 November 2004

","This is a pretty good film, that certainly deserves some awards for writing. The approach for the story is very unusual and original, but it is a good way of telling the story, because you do not know more than Leonard. Having said that, I must say that I did not quite get the ending. What did really happen, I mean does anybody know? Also: Why did Leonard have a tattoo in that last memory with his wife???'

Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Entertaining yet slightly shallow and formulatic summer blockbuster that only surprises in the acting department
","Pirates of the Caribbean is your traditional summer blockbuster: it has good special effects, a lot of action, a few pretty faces and not too much of a story. But that is not all. It was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, which usually means that it is very high on the entertaining side and nothing more. Pirates of the Carribean fits that profile almost exactly. It is entertaining (although slightly longish when the cave is visited for the second time), that's for sure, but the makers of this film have succeeded in doing something that I had not yet seen in a summer flick of this magnitude (or maybe I have simply forgotten). They have chosen a cast, that was so superb on the one side, that it almost all of the other actors became mere puppets. Yes folks, I am talking about Johnny Depp. He is just amazing as Jack Sparrow. It is not that he is amazingly funny or something, but he just manages to surprise you over and over again. Then there is the accent and of course not to forget that strange way of movement he has throughout the film. Jack Sparrow might be quirky but he is not in your face' quirky and that is something I also liked about that character. Johnny Depp ruled as Jack Sparrow and outshone all but one of his co-stars who became mere puppets in the Jack Sparrow Show'. The exception was (of course) Geoffrey Rush, who was very solid and did a good Job as Captain Barbossa. The rest of the cast, well I've said it and I'm not sorry for telling the truth: you acted decent, but in the presence of Mr.Depp you faded into the background.
Concluding this review I'd have to say that the acting was the only surprising thing in this film. There are some typical one-liners which either fall flat or which I just do not consider funny (SPOILERS AHEAD), like when the pirate in the cave says: `I'm gonna teach you the meaning of pain!' (SPOILERS END). This sort of thing simply does not do it for me. Also I thought that I, as a viewer, was not involved' deeply enough in the love between Elizabeth and William. Jack Sparrow was just too overwhelming and I feel that the film could have actually done without about everything but Jack Sparrow, without losing it's appeal. This is well made, light-hearted summer entertainment though and not some film you are supposed to think about. Worth watching once, maybe even twice (for seeing Jack Sparrow again most likely), but then it should be left alone.

Beauty and the Beast," Coppola's Dracula for the faint of heart
","Beauty and the Beast is a great love story, not only for the little ones, but for the big ones' as well. I must admit that I, as a twenty-something, did feel that the story was somewhat predictable, but the execution of the whole was so excellent that it did not bother me that me that much. It remained a good film, although without predictability it could have been a masterpiece. Disney somehow never seizes to amaze me with the quality of their animated features and I hope that it remains that way for many years to come. If you want to see a really romantic film with your girlfriend and you're positive that she can't stomach Coppola's Dracula, Beauty and the Beast provides you with an equally dark, yet less brutal fairy tale. Don't worry though, there enough laughs as well!

","Eminem meeting Disney and a horror film (you'll know what I mean when you've seen the film), it really has not much of a plot, but it still is entertaining. Due to a few comic lines a few nice songs and a good moral. Well of course you might consider it offensive but I don't (OK I'm from Holland and we've brought you Paul Verhoeven) but still, you can't be offended if you have a sense of humour and if you remember this is ONLY a film.
The message of this film (the moral) is the same that the makers of South Park have tried to bring over in their series, only they stuffed it in a better box with this film.

To all the people who criticised this movie, because of it's bad language, violence etceteras: You have NOT learned a thing and you'd better watch this movie again.",7,18,29,16 July 2000
Spider-Man 2," Spidey flies again
","Well with a great movie like Spider-Man, it is very easy for the sequel to become a disappointment, but luckily for me and others the Spider-Man franchise does not take a fall after the first film, because the director and the cast did their jobs good as did the people who wrote the script. They all stayed true to the original Spider-Man comics and comic series as a lot of people learned to love them.
I must say that I was really amazed at how well Tobey Maguire pulled off the nerdy Peter Parker once again, with him being even clumsier and unluckier than in the first film. This did not only make for some very funny scenes but it also made me feel for him as much (if not more) than in the first film. When it came to his personal life and the things that had happened in the first film, I was moved a great deal and I shed some tears as I watched. The amount of emotion and the feeling of honesty and reality created by the director and the cast that moves you to tears is something that is not usually found in Â‘action' films and I want to than the people involved in creating such a real and believable experience for the viewer in the cinema and at home.
What I loved most about the Spider-Man comic series and what I love most about this film though is the way the writers are able to create dilemmas all of us can identify with. They are what give Spider-Man a very human face and not make him a superhero like for instance Clark Kent in the Superman films. He seems to have much less of a burden than Spider-Man, which seems somewhat unbelievable, regarding the complexity of a superhero life.
In my view there is only one downside to this film is J.K Simmons who portrays Jonah Jameson. I found him to be quite annoying and to tell the truth I thought that he was a bit unbelievable in his role, but that is just me. The rest of the film was really good. The action, the comedy the story, the actors and the romance. It just was GOOD. All  of it. I especially enjoy the on screen chemistry between Kirsten Dunst and Tobey Maguire and must confess that in my mind Tobey = Spider-Man and Kirsten = Mary Jane. I therefore hope that they will continue to make at least 2 maybe 3 Spider-Man films, although I doubt they will do another one after the third. But this is more than praise, this is a WARNING. This is a warning to all at Columbia Pictures and Marvel Enterprises. DO NOT DARE to replace Tobey or Kirsten and continue the franchise, for I will not stand for it (and many other won't stand for it as well). If that does not help, take a good look at the Batman franchise, that almost died after Michael Keaton left.
As much as I enjoyed Spider-Man 2, I felt that the film was a notch worse than the first film 2 years ago. This does not mean that the film was worse, but rather that it isn't as new and exciting anymore. Sequels do not only have to live up to it's predecessor, but they also suffer from the fact that a the shininess has worn off a little bit and they've got more mileage. Still the best film I've seen in a while (including The Return of the King).

Billy Elliot," Pretty good
","The story of this film was quite good, as was the execution, but the best thing about this film have to be the characters portrayed by the children actors (Michael and Billy in the film). They both were brilliant and made this film what it was. Another thing that really astounded me, was how much 25 year old Michael resembled 'young' Michael.

","OK, this is overdone, stuff, but visually very attractive (not only because of Milla Jovovich), plus the story is OK and there is a lot of action and also there are a few laughs. The best one here is Milla (GOD, she is beautiful), she's really great as the confused superior being, who only speaks a foreign language (which sounds really good, Luc). I wonder why she got a razzie nomination, those people who vote for that are really stupid. If anyone should get it it is that president. Oldman was OK as the villain, but not too great. He somehow reminded me of a very famous BAD guy in history, yet I can't remember his name.

Finding Nemo," Entertaining, but not HIGH CLASS Disney stuff
","While Nemo certainly entertains it is in no way a classic. In fact, disregarding 'A Bugs Life' I think it is the worst collaboration between Pixar and Disney. While watching the film, I felt that the emotional depth of the events could have been explored a lot more and I also felt that the film was not as funny as other animated films I've seen. To be honest, I felt that there wasn't that much magic around this time. I found Dory to be the most annoying fish ever (I can safely say that she wasn't funny 5 % of the time and annoying 95%) and frankly I felt that the other characters weren't too good either. I mean I liked Nemo and Gill and I thought everything with Crush in it was pretty cool, but in the end I felt that the majority of the characters just were NOT likable and cute enough. Also the film seemed to suffer from the lack of a true villain. All in all, this is an entertaining film, your kids will truly enjoy, but as far as adults are concerned, this one might have fared better if there would have been more magic, better characters and maybe even a shorter running time. Not the MUST-SEE it is made out to be and certainly not one of Disney's best. Well certainly it won an Oscar, but hey, when was the last time THAT meant something, not to mention that from what I've heard there wasn't much competition (as in 'the other 2!!! films had even less quality).7 out of 10 post scriptum: I rented the 2-DVD set and must say that the animated short 'Exploring the Reef' is even worse than Finding Nemo itself (a small 6 out of 10), thus making the animated short 'Knick Knack' (bigger 7 out of 10 than NEMO) from 1989 the best thing (in more than one way) on the 2 discs",7,1,3,20 November 2004
Blade," Move over Buffy, here comes Blade!
","Before watching this film, I had relatively little knowledge of the comic book character Blade. I'd only seen him as a special guest' once or twice on the animated series of Spider-Man I was watching when I was in my early teens and the only things I remembered, were that he was a vampire hunter and that he seemed to be a native American. In the film version dedicated to Blade, he still hunts vampires, but instead of being a native American he is black. I, for one, do not care, but if there would be a film with a black Spidey, an Asian Wolverine, a blue Hulk or a black Kingpin in a Spider-Man film, I don't think I could bare it. Now I'm not judgmental or something, so I would not dismiss different colored characters immediately, but I guess for some characters it would be harder for me to stomach, because I like them more than others.
Getting back to this film, I must say that it starts off great, with an original insight into the lifestyle of modern vampires and some good old action. The film just immediately finds it's pace and luckily it stays on it for the bigger part of the picture. The contributors to the films capability to do that the actors. Wesley Snipes is good as vampire hunting Blade as is Kris Kristofferson as his elderly sidekick Whistler. The best performance though, in my opinion, comes from Stephen Dorff, who not only seems to enjoy playing Deacon Frost but seems to actually become Deacon Frost just for the take of each scene he is in. He doesn't just act Frost, he breathes Frost, he IS Frost!
The direction of the film, is OK. Nothing great, nothing bad. The choreography of the action sequences is mostly good and there are just some minor things (which are present in almost every film) that could have been improved in those important departments (important for an action film that is!). The things I do not like about this film, I would like to blame on the script. First of all I feel that Blade's personal drama could have gotten a bit more attention, so that he could have more depth as a character and second of all I didn't quite like the ending of the film. Why? Well, first of all, the ending is somewhat predictable. Secondly, I felt that it could have been more original and spectacular. I mean, throughout the film Frost makes such a big fuss about La Morga, that  in the end I couldn't believe what kind of wuss the prophecy foretold. Last and maybe least, the lines in the end aren't too good. Well maybe that is putting it a bit too harsh, but Blade screaming Frost' over and over again seemed a little lame and unoriginal to me.

The Great Dictator," Ballsy, cinematic milestone, that isn't nearly as good as it's rep
","The main thing that bothered me in The Great Dictator, is that it is too lengthy for what it's supposed to be. There just isn't an intriguing story here (or one that should be spread out as long as it has). I know this film is supposed to be a spoof of Hitler, but it fails at that, because there are just a few comic scenes that could have easily been put in a 20 minute feature (this would have stopped the repeating of several Â‘funny' or should I say tiresome gags as well). I hear you say though: but there STILL is a love story. Well sorry mates, that one is quite a bummer as well, because there are no real emotions there and the viewer is not shown how the barber and Hannah fall in love, you just have to assume it was love at first sight. The ending is NOT at all original and the final words that hit the viewer, just before the lights go out are understandably a bit idealistic (which makes them seem a bit cheesy now). But remember, back in 1940 people all over the world didn't yet know what was happening in Germany and they still though worse things might be prevented. In conclusion, I must say that I admire Chaplin's craftsmanship and his guts to make this film, yet I also feel a bit bewildered why this ranks so high in IMDB's top 250. Maybe it's the intention or the idea behind the film. All I can say is, that watched out of it's original context in the 21st century, this film comes off way worse than other things I've seen by Chaplin. It's just not funny, too unemotional and too long to be good.

Constantine," Demon Hunter C
","Well, there goes the world again, for the End of Days is nearing. I must admit that I'm not a real fan of 'Angels versus demons' of 'God versus Lucifer' films, but I thought that the comic book based Constantine could bring a nice twist to the oh so familiar story. Sometimes it even does. The film is well filmed and at times it is really surprising. What the film lacks though is depth and excitement. The film is not very gripping and I think that is because the lead character (played by Keanu Reeves) is not gripping enough. Whether this is a failure of the script or Keanu I can't really say, since I don't know the comics but I admit I felt little connection with our hero. I could connect much better with Angela (Rachel Weisz) and I think she acted very well. She was about the only one who brought some feeling into this. Sure Keanu had some funny lines and his cynical ways were pretty good most of the time, but his character and Weisz's didn't seem to connect at all (on any level). Another minor 'bug' in my mind is that the bad guys weren't well-cast either. They just weren't scary in any way...it always seemed that while Constantine was just a man and they were demon's they couldn't do him one bit of harm. Silly...but an explanation for the lack of thrills in this one. In the beginning I expected something like The Crow, Dracula or Vampire Hunter D and in the end I got 'The Exorcist on the road' or...well you've read the summary...somewhere between 6,5 and 6,75 out of 10 (with a small 7 given upon voting)",7,3,8,27 August 2005
The Others," A bit 6th Sense'- ish
","This is one of those films, that came to being in something of a boom, that started when The 6th Sense became successful. The boom of the supernatural films. Since then we have seen (or not) The Gift, What Lies Beneath, Unbreakable and (of course) this one (many will follow). This film may be one of (quite) a lot, but it certainly is not 13 in a dozen. Although this film is not original at all times (borrowing a bit from the 6th Sense and being sort of predictive) it still is well made, well acted and well directed. Compliments for making something not original in a good way. If you like this, try Alejandro Amenábar's Tesis. It really ROCKS!!!

Chicken Run," The way, we treat Chicken's is not nice, but the way they deal with it is fun and exciting to watch
","Well the great amount of chicks in this movie definitely was not the reason I watched this movie (as it would be when Coyote Ugly comes to our town cinema (which I doubt)) and neither was the great commercial, for the commercial pretty much sucked. There were actually 3 other reasons I watched this, first of all because Mel Gibson provided the film with a voice and I think he's got a good taste of movies; second the average vote here on IMDB and third of all the box  office result and I must say I was not disappointed, for this movie was good. It was funny, exciting and in a way I really felt for those chicks, I mean look at the way we hold them, that farm looked like a concentration camp for chickens. Anyway, this really is a good film for young and old and I must say I am pretty happy about the way things are going with Dreamworks, for they finally give some resistance to the oh so mighty Disney kiddy films. Not that I do not like Disney's films, on the contrary I love most of them, but I like a bit variation too man. I mean Dreamworks' Antz was much better than Disney's A Bug's Life, whereas Buena Vista's (sort of Disney's) Armageddon was much better than Dreamworks' Deep Impact. I just love a bit of competition, cause it makes everyone struggle to make the best product and that benefits who in the end? US! So watch this and enjoy

X-Men," Make a sequel please, I'm begging you!!!
","Nowadays most of the summers movies leave nothing much to talk about, this one however is different, for it does leave plenty to think about. The reason for that is that most of the summers movies are made out of effects and nothing more. No script, no characters and so on. Others however do tend to have a good script but do not have the right length or pace to be truly great. We have had a share of both of these kinds of movies in this summer and the ones who obviously fit into the first category are: Mission Impossible 2, The Perfect Storm, The Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps. Having neither seen The Perfect Storm not The Nutty Professor I can still give the reason all 3 became blockbusters. It is because of their explosiveness, their effects and their BIG stars. This does not mean they are not good. I mean M:I 2 is good due to it's explosiveness, The Perfect Storm is good when you watch it on the big screen, for the effects are overwhelming, yet when you'd see it at home it would suck. As for The Nutty Professor 2, that is just a piece of trash. Of the latter category I have only seen one film so far, being Gladiator. Now that was a film which could have been great, if the director had approached it differently, but due to too much politics and a few slow parts in the film it was only' good and only' one of the summers best. This film though is not the same as any of the film's mentioned above, for it accomplishes something I have not seen for quite a while. It combines good characters and emotions with great special effects. I think the last time I saw anything like it was in 1997. Wondering what movie, well yes (I'm sorry) Titanic. I bet now you are wondering what makes X  Men so great well here it comes:
First of all I really must credit the director, Bryan Singer, whom many of you know, I guess, from his BIG breakthrough movie The Usual Suspects. I must thank him, for he is the only director after Tim Burton to make a truly great motion picture out of a comic book character. This does not however mean that the two directors can be compared, for the theme of the movies and the nature of the characters are much too different. Still they can be compared to both having had a great vision on something already made and imagined. Bryan Singer did not only bring in great music, good camerawork and great special effects (something he had not done before), but he also brought to us a tight and fast paced story without loose ends in which not the effects had the upper hands, but the actors, who supplied the movie with emotions and jokes. This accomplishment is always due to the director and the writers (who let the actors play their vision), the people who cast the actors and last but very far from least the actors themselves, who I might add here are no BIG stars but still known, appreciated and capable actors.
First of all there is Magneto (Ian McKellen), who is a villain' unlike many others, for he is neither wicked like Darth Vader or The Emperor from Star Wars nor a psycho like Norman Bates from Psycho or something like that. Instead he is a mutant who acts out his knowledge that people who are different' will be stereotyped, loathed, maybe even feared and as a result of that will be oppressed or even killed. He is a villain' with a motive and can therefore be understood and is not likely to be hated or despised by the viewer.
Then there is Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), who is the latest mutant to join the X  Men in the fight against Magneto. His addition to the group however is somehow overshadowed' by a rivalry between him and Cyclops in which Wolverine delivers some good laughs. Wolverine however also has a couple of nice moments with Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) and Rogue (Anna Paquin). Plus he is in some cool fighting scenes with Mystique (Rebecca Romijn Stamos) and Sabretooth (Tyler Mane) and therefore is my favourite in this movie.
The coolest fighting scene' however is the one in which Storm (Halle Berry) uses all her power to fight Toad (Ray Park), who I think has, in the last two years, played the coolest villains on screen (Darth Maul and The Headless Horseman). It really is a pity that we did not see more of his cool moves and fighting, but hey he was not the main villain in this film.
Someone I really must not leave out of this ode is of course Anna Paquin, for she performs her character, Rogue, with class. This however is not the only reason I must mention this character, it is also because her character is the one that has the most depth and the one I could identify most with.
Last but not least there are Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Dr. Jean Grey. Patrick Stewart delivers a good performance, playing a character he appears to have been born to play. Famke Janssen delivers a good performance too and is very likeable and believable as a doctor.
Wrapping this up, I must say, I can not wait to hear the people behind it are to making a sequel. I feel that way, because I truly believe that with X  Men, a comic series has been brought to the cinema, that does not only meet the expectations of the true fans, but that it also is a film which satisfies the normal' viewer. So please, go and see this if you can,  I swear you will not regret it.

The Terminator," Great classic
","This is truly a great film, which of course is always somehow compared with part two, just as part two is always compared to this one. Sure this one has it's advantages over the second one, but it also is a bit worse at times. But those times are not as frequent or as important as the many times it has advantages over the second installment, because everything that is worse in this film, over the second one has to do with special effects. Now listen closely, the effects are not bad, they are as good as they were in 1984, but they just are not as good as the effects in 1991 and that is it. Regarding the rest of the film, it sure as hell is somewhat better than the sequel. First of all, everything in this film is more original and fresh (because it is a first of course), but not only that. One thing I like a bit more in this film, is that it is darker you know, more mechanic and inhuman. You really get a sense here of the fact that you are dealing with an emotionless machine. All this dark sphere that is created must be ascribed mainly to James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger. James Cameron, of course for his vision and execution of the way he felt the music and the sets had to be and Schwarzenegger for his good performance. I know that many people may well argue about my last statement: 'Good performance, Schwarzenegger can't play CRAP!' Well in terms of great character roles or dramatic ones this might all be very true, but in this film Schwarzenegger captured everything his character was about perfectly. You might say he didn't have to act at all. But you go ahead, try to pass as a machine in a movie, kill emotionless, walk static, look grim, speak slowly and well 'machinery' (cut off). All of this enables the viewer to totally believe that he is indeed a machine.
The other actors here are not to be forgotten either, Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor are also very well characterized by Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton respectively. I mean they very believable and they have a good chemistry in the film. They are also the characters seen in the best parts of the film (not the coolest, that's what Schwarzenegger is for). My favorite scenes in this movie certainly are the 'intimate scene' and the 1st 2029 A.D. scene with the epilogue at the beginning. All in all I must say that this is a masterpiece of cinema and a must see for everyone who love movies.

Sleepy Hollow," It's Tim Burton allright!!!!!
","This is a creepy, dark, yet strange fantasy / horror flick in the likes of well Tim Burton. Only he could make this the creepy fairytale it has become. But it is not merely his doing that makes this one such a good film. Johnny Depp (as the New Yorker who at first mocks the small - towners for their beliefs and then becomes astonished and terrified after witnessing the Headless Horseman) and Christina Ricci (as the fair, enchanting, mystic, big breasted (she's not playing that you must know .DAMN) maiden who is attracted to Depp) are really good + they also have good chemistry. By the way, another comment on Ricci, I like what she does, always playing non  ordinary women + I like the way she looks, no too pretty and painted and plastic, but normal, natural an pretty good (THANK GOD, NOT EVERYONE IS A BRITNEY SPEARS - -LIKE MODEL, which also is true of the pretty Kate Winslet of course.

The supporting cast is good too, as is the music the decoration, the blood, the story and of course the Headless Horseman (note: THE HEADLESS ONE). That stuntman (RAY PARK) is really great, swinging that axe and sword and fighting. He's GREAT just as he was in The Phantom Menace (please HOLLYWOOD  PEOPLE, choose him more often.

Hotel Rwanda," An African holocaust
","As one can probably imagine, a film with an 8,5 out of 10 (with 4.356 votes) ranking at number 130 of the IMDb's top 250 has few naysayers. There are some there however and I've taken the trouble to read them. What I think is sort of funny, is that many of the critique that is placed is utterly stupid. One person actually goes so far as to say that the film: 'doesn't manage to escape the formulaic Hollywood feel-good story of the hero who wins out in the end. This typical treatment may be fine for other topics, but Rwanda was a real genocide, and this tragedy should not be treated as the playground of 'based on a true story' movies.' This is I feel a very feeble critique. This is not a film about the Rwandan genocide as is was, but a film about the events Paul Rusesabagina witnessed. He cannot help the fact that he didn't get to see much of the genocide and that he and his family survived in the end. Or maybe flat6 (the writer) thinks they should have just killed Rusesabagina off in the film, which certainly would have been more dramatic, but much less true. Also, doesn't this criticism mean that Schindler's List is a bad film as well? Another writer, imdb-45 states that: 'The film gives no treatment as to the reason for the hatred between the two sects of African black people and concentrates virtually on a man's heroic attempt to save people in a hotel, many of which are would-be victims of the genocide.' If I'm not mistaken, the reason for the hatred is actually clearly outline in a conversation between Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), Jack (Joaquin Phoenix) and a local African journalist. I mean I am no expert on the subject, but it seemed pretty clear to me (if that was the whole of it). Basically it was just like WW 2, based on race, an African holocaust so to speak (although less organized and without the concentration camps as far as I know).The same author states that: 'there is an awkward product plug for Volkswagon that ruins a genuinely amusing moment. There are product plugs for several different alcohol beverages that don't quite feel right.' Well, sorry but in reality people use product and brand names on a daily basis. So why not in a film? Because than it is advertising? If you recommend a brand of beer to your friends it is also advertising in a way, although on a much smaller scale.Someone else, fooltank77, states that the film doesn't say what happened after the genocide. While that is true, it isn't a flaw. This is the story of Paul Rusesabagina and his family and what happened tot hem during the genocide. The rest is nothing of the films concern. Also, everybody who watches the news occasionally or reads the paper knows that it is far from peaceful down there even now. Do you need to have everything presented to you? Personally I felt that this was a very impressing and good film. The performances and the directing were great and despite the fact that the film didn't show much of the slaughter, it was emotionally unsettling enough. I was especially astounded by the fact that the UN did so little to help. I knew that there wasn't much interference, but the fact that there was virtually no help at all just goes to show that Africa is just too far away for the rich and distant countries to worry. I daresay that the events in the film made me almost ashamed to be living in one of those rich UN countries.I feel that if you actually go to see this film and expect it to be an individual tale within a massive cultural slaughter, you will come to accept that this film has it's boundaries and doesn't show everything that happened before , during or after the genocide. Demanding that and claiming the film is bad because it doesn't give you everything there is, would be like saying Schindler's list is bad, because it didn't show the political situation in Germany in the beginning of the 1930's, how Hitler gained his power, what happened in Stalingrad, what Dr.Mengele did during medical experiments on Jews or the killing of the moffen-hoeren (women who had sex with Germans during WW 2) in the Netherlands after the war. My point here is that a film like Schindler's list doesn't actually have as much background info as is demanded of this film by some viewers. It is just that we (in the western world) now much more about WW 2 than we do of a distant African genocide. Also there is so much suffering when something like this occurs and one film can not show it all. All it can do is show us parts of the tragedy and maybe inspire viewers to try and find out more about it. Giving a complete picture of such a tragedy is like completing a puzzle. Bear in mind that this is only the first piecehopefully.8 out of 10",8,7,9,16 March 2005
Ocean's Twelve," I think the cast had a better time on this one than the public has, or maybe I just hope so
","I went to this movie, not expecting much. Actually I didn't even intend to go, since I thought it would be a crap movie, but you know how it is when a friend of yours wants to go to the movies with you. SOmetimes it's just hard to pick a movie. I had coincidentally seen quite a few cinematic releases recently, he doesn't like Jim Carrey (Series of unfortunate Events) and the rest of the films are even more unappealing than Ocean's Twelve (Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, Alexander, The Grudge or some stupid dutch film like Floris). What do you do then? You settle for the lesser evil: Ocean's Twelve! Finally when you go to the cinema with expectations that low, you sometimes are surprised at how good the film actually is. Too bad Ocean's Twelve isn't one of them. I actually felt that the whole first hour of the film was pretty bad. It could have been much tighter, even in the beginning. I mean, why make the part with Benedict all so lengthy when god knows there are telephones and Danny Ocean is the leader. But that's not the main problem with this film. I mean while it is fun to see all the characters from the first film in action and the whole deal Julia Roberts in the hotel are well-meant the entire film has nothing of the adventure of the first. There is no excitement, no suspense, even no sexual tension between any of the characters (I was especially disappointed with Zeta-Jones' addition on that last point). I can see what the story is here, but it is just too elaborate and there are too many different set-up's. The whole thing is filmed in a very uninvolved and non-thrilling way, which is exasperated (I've seen Shaun of the dead as well!) by the fact that many to all of the heists and set-up's are revealed after they have already been made. Also: why set up another heist when you could set up Benedict again? The makers of the film clearly want to make you think they do it because they itch. Well make it clearer and more obvious to see. For I do not believe it after seeing this film.When criticizing this movie, one has to include the cast and I must say that overall I was pretty disappointed with it. George Clooney didn't have any charisma this time around as Danny 'smooth operator' Ocean , Andy Garcia wasn't quite mean enough, I can't figure out why Bernie Mac was in the film and as already mentioned I felt that there was more potential romantic / sexual potential in Zeta-Jones' character. So far as to doing you job badly. The rest of the cast was only mediocre, with the exception of Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts who did OK. Considering Vincent Cassel, I just thought he was miscast and the entire character structure was crap. I mean an adversary to THE GANG should have been much different than the character he played and his whole scheme and and his whole set-up could have been much more believable. No matter how mediocre I thought the acting was, it is not my intention to slam the actors here, for much of the blame can be allocated to the writers and the director (most obviously in Zeta-Jones' respect).Is there nothing good then here? Well, of course there are some nice moments in the film and it makes you smile at times. Of course it isn't a total snooze-fest and not utterly boring, but it compared to it's predecessor it really is A LOT worse. I'd actually given this one only a 5 out of 10, but because of some nice bits and that tad of charme that shine through at times I'll be gentle this time.6 out of 10 post scriptum: please no Ocean's 13 or Ocean's 10 / Ocean's 9 (after one or two members of the crew have been kidnappedI BEG YOU !!!!!!!!!!",6,4,5,4 January 2005
Snatch," What can I say?
","There is a lot one could say about this movie. First of all, you could compare it to Pulp Fiction, but I won't do that, cause it would not be honest to the filmmaker, whom you could compare to Tarantino. But that would not be honest too. One thing you can do though, is say that this is a gangster film, which reminds one of Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and that the director Guy Ritchie makes Tarantino alike films. Let me say this to you, this guy is not a new Tarantino or a british Tarantino. He is a filmmaker who stands on his own and does not copy Tarantino in a way. He just happens to make the same sort of films as Tarantino.To cut that crap. What about the film itself. Well it is a really good film, although sometimes hard to understand due to some bad accents (thank god we have subtitles here). The story is well directed and the actors are all good. There is also a bit of humor. But what struck me most was the complexity of the story and the unpredictableness of this film. Well done!

Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Strangelove: strange but I like it
","Dr. Strangelove is a political satire of the cold war between Russia and the United States of America, which was made in 1964. The fact that it was made during the Cold War and not after it makes this film not only very special, but also daring in my opinion. The film itself is full of top secret information, suspicions people and anti communist attitudes which somehow remind me of James Bond themes from the Cold War era. But contrary to James Bond films these things are exaggerated and turned slightly comic, without making this film too strange and surreal. This is due to the fact that not only the communist Ruskies are depicted in a bad way, but so are the Americans, who (in some cases) seem to be war hungry, patriotic rednecks with dung for brains. In all of the confusion that springs from the failing of a  failsafe plan, there is also one ingredient which could not be missed in any film concerned with the Cold War. I'm talking about the German ingredient, in this case Dr. Stragelove, a German scientist, who turned American after World War II. This character is in my opinion the greatest character of the entire film and he is one of the reasons this film is still good almost 40 years after it was first released. Just watch the last 10 minutes of the film and you will know what I mean. The ending of the film, from the first dropping bomb to Dr. Strangelove, is truly funny and in my opinion a classic moment in movie making . In a way though, the entire film is a classic moment in movie making, because ultimately the film and the mishaps depicted, are of all times and Kubrick realized it just as you will (just listen to the words in the final song played).

The Beach," Pretty good, despite all the bad reviews I've read
","I went to this one, knowing that it could be crap, but hey, I do not care what others think and once again this way of thinking did not prove me wrong.This flick is basically about a young twenty who goes away on a trip to Thailand by himself, because he wants to forget his past. There he meets a loony (Robert Carlyle) who gives him a map to a secret paradise. He asks two strangers, Françoise (Virginie Ledoyen who was really great in her first big American Film and good looking too by the way) and Etienne (Guillaume Canet) to come and join them.After they have found the island they meet an alternative group who lives there and they join them, but after a while problems evolve and a minor 'hell' breaks loose.This is the plain story-line of the movie, but there is so much more to it, it has a message and that really is what fascinated me a lot in the beginning and at the end. There was a good story there, but the way it was brought over, never really losing the actual message out of sight. Now believe me the direction, the soundtrack and the cast are good. There also is a bit gore, but it fits good in the movie and is not unnecessary.Yet this film is not flawless, it was good entertainment over all, yes and it was very good in the beginning and in the end, but in the middle when Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio) loses it, so does the film and that is a shame. It is just too weird, too long and too incomprehensible (in the sense that the viewer himself doesn't know if it is real or not). It could have been so much better, but I guess it had to be.NO MUST SEE BUT DEFINATELY WORTH A TRIP TO THE VIDEOSTORE OR TO THE CINEMA AT A DISCOUNT!!!!!!!!7 out of 10P.S.

Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," What a miraculous thing...
","happened when I saw this movie again. I, who actually always had not understood why so many people like this film a lot better then The Empire strikes Back finally understood it. I mean I had seen this film about seven or eight times before, but when I saw it again, I realized what a great film this is. I'd immediately have given it a ten out of ten if it wouldn't have been for the beginning of the film, which I think sucks a bit. First of all I do not like that singing performance in the beginning that much, but that is not what bothered me. What really bothered me were the bad, bad, bad effects in the Rancor vs. Luke fighting scene. The bad effects draw all the attention to them than to focus it on the action and that was so bad no 10 can ever be given by me to this film. Apart from that this film is just one enormous accumulation of excitement, fun, action, emotion, surprises and twists which will not let you out of it's grip until the end. All this is held together by the performances of the great cast of Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), Anthony Daniels (C-3PO), Kenny Baker (R2-D2), Billy Dee Williams (Lando) , Clive Revill (Emperor Palpatine) and the Voice of James Earl Jones as Darth Vader. As you may have noticed during my other reviews I really like Harrison Ford as Han Solo most but I must say my other personal favorite is Carrie Fisher as the Princess who does not mind to get her hands dirty. This (again) does not mean I do not like the other characters, as a matter of fact I like them all, but these two have the biggest amount of memorable scenes together. My other favorite pair in this trilogy (mostly due to this film) would (of course) be Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker.
Now, to not bore you more with my views on this trilogy I'd like to say something about the whole Saga. It actually is more or less aimed at George Lucas and all the original cast of Star Wars, but they'll never read it anyway so here it goes. With the prequel Trilogy taking it's form as we speak there is an enormous hope going around Star Wars fans everywhere that Lucas will also do the last Trilogy. Lucas himself though said that he won't do it and it has been also said by other participants of this Trilogy that they won't return. Let me give you my view on it. In my opinion, opening weekends and box  office results have shown there still is an interest in the Star Wars stories and regarding that one is probably safe suggesting that people would go and see the last Trilogy too. I mean, The Return of the Jedi is a good ending of an epic story, but the fact there is more, makes me wonder what more there could be to the story and I must admit, I need to know how it continues. So in my opinion Lucas should have a poll on his Star Wars site on whether or not the public wants to see the last Trilogy as well. If the outcome is yes he should polish up the story and go to all of his original cast (Fisher, Hamill and Ford) and ask them to return for their roles, for I presume the crowd wants to see their old heroes back on the screen. I mean I would understand it if Lucas said he doesn't want to do it, but maybe the fact that the people want to see his stuff without even knowing what it is about, makes him feel so honored that he'll do it anyway. Plus, I mean with the technology of this day, he could shoot all three films back to back (as was done with the Lord of the Rings Trilogy) and he would be done fast, rather than spending more than 6 years on the whole Trilogy. As for the original cast, I could understand them, if they do not want to return, I mean for they all do not need the money, but it would be nice to see them again in the roles that made them famous. I am not going to say now that they owe it to the audience to return as Leia, Luke and Han to the big screen, because the audience watches their films, buys their books and stuff. No, I won't and you know why? Because that is not true they don't owe us anything. They do what they like and we watch it if we like and that's it. We want to be entertained and they provide us with entertainment. I mean it is not like fame has served all of the stars of this Trilogy well (except maybe for Ford) and we have to respect that too. It is their life and not ours and so it is up to them if they want to re  enter that Star Wars frenzy or not. Cause a frenzy it is. All I do hope, is that Lucas really thinks about making the third Trilogy of the Star Wars saga and I also hope all of the other original' cast and crew members do the same, because I want to see the ending of an epic story, knowing that all the people I know' worked on it.
Watch, be surprised, entertained, sad and jolly.
May the force be with youalways.

Taxi Driver," One of the Top Movies i've ever seen...
","on my list of BAD movies. This movie, of course as you might as well have seen is pretty high ranked in the IMDB top 250 and is also acclaimed by many critics, but I can tell you, this movie sucks. Mainly because of the good grades this movie got by critics and also from critics and I like De Niro and some of Scorsese's films (most of all GoodFellas) I taped this movie when it was on TV a few weeks ago. I started this movie thinking it would some kind of average or just above average movie, because I tend to not like some of those movies that are generally being enjoyed, like The Godfather, I think, even rated very high all the time it deserves a 6 or maybe 7 out of ten. But now getting to the movie, in my TV guide it got 4 out of four and the plot was outlined as, whacko Taxi Driver's life changes dramatically after a meet with someone. After the film starts you get some kind of average, what happpens in the life of a Taxi Diver, then he goes nuts (after 1 hour) and you think, YES, now it'll really begin. He buys guns and eventually even shoots a guy. And then evantually as before ... nothing, it goes on for another 20 minutes or 30 like that and then I just couldn't stand it no more. Nothing happens, this is JUST an average story about the pretty normal life of a man, that changes at a moment(I don't know  if this happened I didn't finish the movie), with average performances from the cast, without any thrills, chills, laughs, brutal scenes, touching moments and so on.......... Seen his good grade on IMDB makes me wanna give it a 1 out of 10, but I'll be nice, I'll give it what it deserves, a 3 out of 10.",3,11,28,26 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," I now know of the anger, the hatred and the love
","The hype surrounding Attack of the clones, not even came near to the hype that surrounded The Phantom Menace three years ago. The biggest contributors to that, were of course the fact that The Phantom Menace did not live up to people's expectations as being the best film ever made and that it has not been 16 years since the last Star Wars film, but only three. These two factors also contributed to Attack of the Clones fairing much worse than The Phantom Menace at the box office (the huge success of Spider-Man being a third factor). Despite a lot of good reviews, many people were not to excited to see this film and critics (again) did not appreciate the effort. They described Hayden Christensen's portrayal of Anakin as bad and the evolving relationship between him and Senator Amidala (Natalie Portman) was laughable. I tried not to be hasty on my comment and went to see this film twice, before making my final judgment. I did that, because I had learned from the mistake I made with The Phantom Menace. I would have loved to change my review of that film after I had seen it for the second time on the big screen, because I realized, that if I wanted to comment on a film so loaded with effects, the only way I could do every aspect of the film justice was to see it twice (the remainder of my thoughts on Episode I, are to be found in my Episode IV review).
The Attack of the Clones film takes place ten years after The Phantom Menace and a lot has happened. Anakin has become a Jedi, Padmé Amidala is no longer Queen and the Republic finds itself in a predicament once again. This is to be the background of an epic tale, in which the effects will not be the only things to stand out.The characters portrayed in Attack of the Clones are basically the same as in Episode I. There are (of course) a few additions (such as count Dooku, Jango and Boba Fett) but the remaining characters from The Phantom Menace are the ones that steal the show in this film. Obi  Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), Anakin (who is now portrayed by Hayden Christensen) and Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman) are portrayed with great skill and love. McGregor's performance as Obi  Wan is a lot better than in The Phantom Menace and even Natalie Portman was able to exceed her first portrayal of Amidala. Hayden Christensen, being a first timer in the Star Wars universe, blends in just perfectly. He captures the inner struggle that tears Anakin apart with great talent and brings it across the screen in a fantastic manner. The love that flourishes between Amidala and Anakin is good, although some critics say it is laughable. Either those critics have forgotten how it is, when one is young and in love for the first time, or they have never been in love at all. Whatever the critics say, I think, that the way the relationship between Amidala and Anakin develops is good. Actually, they serve two purposes, one is to show us how Anakin and Amidala fall in love and the second is to show us the good and bad sides of a troubled Anakin. They show him how he is, angry, hateful, arrogant and loving. The emotions that overwhelm him during the film and will ultimately lead him to the Dark Side.
Contrary to The Phantom Menace, more of the film's attention is focused on the Jedi, especially Mace Windu (Samuel L.Jackson) and Yoda (Frank Oz). Not only is more attention focused on both these characters, but we see them in action for the very first time. For Samuel L.Jackson, this film is a real big step forward. Where he was more like Yoda's sidekick in Episode I, he now gets more involved and is even allowed to lead a Jedi attack in which he also takes part. Another thing that I felt was important, was that he fits much better into this film than he did in The Phantom Menace. One of the highlights of the film, are the lightsaber duels at the end, in which Anakin, Obi  Wan and last but not least Yoda confront Count Dooku (Christopher Lee). The latter fight (Yoda vs. Dooku), is the biggest event of the whole film. We finally get to see the Jedi Master in action and I must say, this was one of the best lightsaber duels I have ever seen. The characters, were however not the only things that were improved. There were many cool new beasts too. My favorites were the three beasts in the execution pit, although I must say the beasts Anakin had to battle in the factory looked pretty good also.
Returning to a good screenwriting form seemed to make everything else pick up too. R2D2 is back to his old habit, of getting C-3PO in trouble, while C-3PO provides the laughs. The battle scenes are also much better than in The Phantom Menace, somewhat bringing back into mind the great battle scenes on Hoth in The Empire Strikes Back. Even the music has improved since the last installment. John Williams succeeded in adding some great tunes to the Star Wars saga, some darker in tone than others, but all of them were great (Oscar Nomination). The effects are great (as always) and will ensure us of a great battle between The Two Towers and The Attack of the Clones for the Academy Award for special effects. Speaking of which, I'm sure that these two films will put on a great battle for most Academy Awards involving technics.
At the end of this review, there are some things I'd like to say to say to Mr.Lucas. First of all: Keep up the good work.' Second of all, I own Star Wars: Behind the Magic, where you can see through a galactic timeline and I must say that I was astounded by what I saw. A timeline covering about 25 thousand years. I think there is some good stuff in there, before Episode I as well as after Episode VI. I know you don't want to do anymore Star Wars after this trilogy, but I m asking you: Just think about it.' Third and last of all, I would like you to do me a favor, if it is possible (heck, I'm no effects guy): Could you please improve some of the effects in the original Star Wars Trilogy before you release it on DVD? Not much of course, but I really hate the effects in the Rancor scene in Return of the Jedi. If something was possible, I'd appreciate it a lot. And if there are no possibilities to improve that scene, than that's OK as well. I will always love your work and appreciate your effort.'

"Monsters, Inc."," Disney does it again
","One can't keep from thinking that the people at Disney will some time run out of idea's to make quality animated features, but it does not seem to be that time of day for a long time. While Monsters Inc is not great, Disney has succeeded in making a film that is funny, enchanting and kind of thrilling. The chases in this film are very exciting and the characters (the good ones anyway) are all likeable. I especially enjoyed the way they brought Boo on screen. She was very cute. Keep on the good work.

Loads of goryness and a monster that can think. Yes, this is extremely rare for the 80's in which most monsters were right down stupid.

American Pie," Is this really how teenage kids behave???
","Well eh yes. This is a film that depicts the way teenagers behave in a great way. The stuff they talk about the way they treat each other and so on. The only thing that just might not be entirely true here is that kids of my age (17  19) don't actually need to get laid before going to college yet or maybe that's just because I live in a little hellhole. Here in our town it is more about kissing (french kissing most of the time). There are actually people who do that 3 or 4 times a night (both males and females). Of course coming to the conversational part of the movie, I can't speak for the girls, but the guys, well they sure like to observe pretty girls, they sure like to talk dirty and stupid and they sure as hell make some dumb bet's or pacts. Some may even do pretty dumb stuff, like Jim, but I haven't witnessed that, I only know the stories (maybe I'm lucky not to have seen some things). If you don't want to hear this or read this, you should stop and start reading the next bit after the blank line. This filthy story is actually from a German film (but I've heard a story about a few drunk guys a friend of mine knows who did the exact same thing). In the film (and in reality, according to my friend) a couple of guys lay a piece of bread on the ground and form a circle around it. Then they started masturbating and the one that came missed had to eat the slice of bread. Well that is quite nasty I must say and I feel far worse than what was depicted in American Pie, for it was intentional.
On to the film I must say I was not so disgusted as many of you Americans might have been. Most of the stuff there seemed pretty natural to me (with a few exotic outbursts, but hey it is a comedy). But what I really think is strange about this is that never have I read a review or comment about this film (or heard from one of my friends) is that there is actually a bit of romance between all that talk about sex and the gross  out comedy. That I found particularly good, for it brought some real refreshment tot the film. Due to the romance it was not the way that there needed to be one crude joke or action after another, you know. That is something that often happens in spoofs like The Naked gun. In those films they become so determined to make you laugh, rather that they totally cross the line and become ridiculous instead of being funny. They should be looking for something refreshing, like the romance here in American Pie (which is a film that can hardly be compared to the naked gun for it is not nonsense). Back to American Pie though. It was not only the story and the jokes that made this a good and fun film, the good performance of the young actors and actresses helped a lot too. They were all good, though there is one actor I must mention separately and that is Jason Biggs. He was really great. He was the best of the bunch, for he was the one featured in the funniest parts of the film, plus he came over like a real funny guy, who was kind of new to everything and who behaved most like I would have behaved I guess (I think he reminded me of myself and that's why I liked him so much).
This really is a film I can recommend to everyone, for I don't see how you could be  offended by the jokes and the situations. The only thing there may be for me to say that this is a film suited for no one under the age of 16 or so (because of the content, although I can imagine I might have liked it then only because of the dirty jokes and not because I had the feeling that the way me and my friends behave is in some form the way teenagers around the world are behaving, maybe even RIGHT NOW). I sure as hell want to see a sequel and I sure as hell know I'm not going to need force someone to make American Pie 2.

The Italian Job," This is not a remake
","Maybe it was because Michael Caine turned 70 or maybe it was because there was a remake' of The Italian Job in cinema's around the world, but halfway the August of 2003 the BBC aired this film. That gave me a somewhat unique chance to go and see this version of The Italian Job before seeing the remake', since the 1969 version was not for rent or buy anyplace I could think of. Now there were basically two reasons for me to see this film, first of all because I think Michael Caine is a good actor and second of all because it is rumored to be a classic. Well I did not find this film to be a classic. Sure the car chases were well filmed (and probably spectacular for 1969), but they didn't do much for me. Neither did any of the acting or the story. Also I found the music to be quite irritating at times (especially in the applauding scene near the ending, which dragged on and on and well you get the idea!). Nevertheless, this is not a total stinker, it just isn't anything special. If I were you I'd skip this one and see the remake', something I did a while after seeing the 1969 version.
The thing with the remake' is that is actually not a remake. The only things these films have in common are the heist, the Mini's and the title. That's is. The underlying story in the 2003 is a lot better and more elaborate than the story in the 1969 version. It also leaves much more room for character development and all of that adds to the excitement of the film. Also the actors are a lot better in this film, than they were in the original. No offense to Michael Caine, but the average actor in this film, was much better than the average actor in the 1969 film of the same name, even when Edward Norton made a somewhat pale' performance. I hate to say it, but his character in this film, was about the worst I've seen him portray yet (which does not mean that he was bad though). Charlize Theron on the other hand surprised me a bit, with the depth and emotion she brought to her character.
The action scenes were good as well and the heist(s) were very well planned, executed and filmed as well, but despite all of these good things I did not feel that this was a great film. It just lacked that extra edge and excitement at times. That extra edge, ironically is originality. Whereas this film succeeds in portraying a very original story and original heist(s), some of the characters missed a bit of originality, as did some of the dialog and a twist or two. In conclusion I'd have to say that the 2003 version of The Italian Job is not a classic, but definitely worth a look, since it is better than it's predecessor carrying the same name.

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," It sure was hyped, but is it hyper ?
","I first got wind of this film in 2000 and it got me really interested in the story. It got me so interested that I read all of the books (plus The Hobbit, of course) and I must say that I was rather pleased with the books, although I found that in The Fellowship of The Ring the Fellowship was too lucky and that The Return of the King was too elaborate. My favorite was without doubt The Two Towers. But having read the books, I was sure a couple of good films could be made, with or without the flaws of the books.
I saw The Fellowship of the Ring twice, actually. The First time on December 22nd and second time on January the 13th. The first time I went to see it, I must say I was really thrilled. I had seen numerous reviews (very many giving the film 2 thumbs up and very few giving it 2 thumbs down). At the time I saw the film for the first time it was No. 1 at the IMDB Top 250, with 9662 votes and a rating of 9,6. So it is definitely GREAT, right??? Well I tried to stay out of the hype, although I was quite excited. I read a number of reviews (only the ones giving the film 2 thumbs down) and here is some of the critique: too much is made of Elijah Woods blue eyes, the female cast has no character development, there is no ending and that sucks after sitting through 3 hours of film, the goblins and orcs looked like cheap horror creatures and so on and on and on. All I have to say about that is BLA, BLA, BLA. What a bunch of gibberish. Who cares about blue eyes?; How are characters (the female ones) that are in the picture for about 10 to 15 minutes supposed to have character development?; Have you read the book?, there is no real ending, there are 2 more pictures to come to complete the story. and Would you rather have the goblins looked like Babe, the Gallant pig??? Deliberately I concentrated on what might be bad (from the reviews) and what I myself thought would stink. The latter one was composed of one thing really, Elijah Wood. I'd seen him in Deep Impact, where he sucked and I must say I expected him to do likewise in this film. He did not though. He performed well, really well, capturing all that is Frodo Baggins, the struggle within, the dear and the excitement of the adventure.
The film itself has a number of really great scenes. My favourite parts are all of the battle/fight scenes, the whole introduction (until The Fellowship of the Ring pops up), the outro and almost all of the scenes with Arwen (Liv Tyler). The scenes with Liv Tyler were all great, really. I especially enjoyed it when she talked elfish. It gave the film so much more of that epic/fantasy glow. There were (of course) a bunch of other good touching scenes, but I cannot remember them all plus there would be too much to name. There were very few things to be said about bad character portraits, after my first view. Though overall I found that Cate Blanchett (Galadriel) and Peter Hugo Weaving (Elrond) were worst including that they were present in the worst scenes (the mirror scene and the counsel scene). But as I watched the film for the second time, I quite liked those scenes too. For Hugo Weaving it was, because I got the Matrix thing out of my head and for Cate Blanchett it was, realising what the scene was about when she became all shiny, blue and upset. A sign that my mind was not too focused on the story, during my first peek at this film. Note that that Ian McKellen (Gandalf) was (by far) the best character in the film.
I did not enjoy the film very much the first time I saw it, because) I was somehow not able to get into the story and the characters as is needed to fully enjoy a movie. I kept getting distracted, finding myself looking for things, wondering: What's next?; I wonder how they've done that and how it'll look!'. I was way too busy looking for the way Peter Jackson had pictured what I myself had once pictured in my brain. The second time I did that much less and I got into the story much better. Because of those problems' during my first view there will be two ratings in the end of this review, of which the second one will be more truthfully than the first one to the film than the first one.
Well you are probably wandering, is this the best film of 2001 or even the best film ever, since it is No. 1 at the IMDB top 250. I could not have said after seeing it once. Well my view after the first time of seeing it was NO, after the second time it was still No. But I have to admit that it is out there with the best ones of the year. A year in which there were many good films I must say. But overall I still feel Moulin Rouge! is the best one this year (despite the film being at No. 1 of the IMDB top 250 now (13 of January) with an almost unbelievable 9,2 from 33583 voters). It also is not the best film ever, because although it is very good, it is not excellent. Plus I feel that a film that tells not a whole story, can be the best film ever (in my opinion).
Despite having a bad day, the first time I saw this film, I was sure of one thing. Namely that this film will get a bunch of Oscars and Academy Award nominations. This is what I think it will get. Though I only hope for the Best supporting Actor nomination (I do not believe he will get it).
Oscars for: Best Effects, Sound Effects Editing; Best Sound; Best Art Direction-Set Decoration; Best Editing; Best Effects, Visual Effects and Best Music, Original Score 
Nominations for: Best Cinematography; Best Picture; Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Ian McKellen); Best Director; Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published; Best Costume Design; Best Music, Song and Best Makeup
One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them alland in the darkness bind them.

The Matrix Revolutions," Not everything that has a great beginning has a great end
","After seeing The Matrix Reloaded, earlier this year, I was quite hopeful on the third part of the series entitled The Matrix Revolutions. I was expecting that the characters I ran into in Reloaded would have some significance to the story of the Matrix and I was expecting that the story would take an original twist or two. Well, I must say that not unlike many others I was disappointed and I guess many others will yet have to be disappointed.The bad thing about the Matrix Revolutions is that it is neither The Matrix, nor the thing Reloaded promised us. The Matrix introduced us to some very interesting and ingenious new characters, who I thought (and perhaps others too) to have some sort of higher relevance in the Matrix story. Well, they do not! I expected that there was more behind Persephone, Merovingian and his henchmen, but there wasn't. But what is worse, I thought that after Reloaded, Revolutions could still be original and inventive cinema. It couldn't.The main complaint I have about The Matrix Revolutions, is that it is not what The Matrix was. It is not a cybernetic spectacle with high intelligence. It is rather an uninspired, destruction derby of the likes of Independence Day and other disaster / destruction movies, where everyone and everything within range is crushed and demolished, (in an attempt) to enjoy the viewer. Well, Mr. and Mr. Wachowski. If I wanted to see such trashing and demolition, don't you think I would have watched Bad Boys 2 in the cinema. Really, how unoriginal of you.Another thing that really struck me, while I was watching the film was the immense stupidity that was called Neo in this film. Sure in the first film he was rather ignorant, but he learned and by the time I watched Reloaded he had learned immensely and I would have actually thought there was some brain in the man, but that vision I held of Neo was completely destructed whilst watching The Matrix Revolutions. I mean, how can it be, that Neo (also called The One, as in our last hope) can sense things, other people cannot even see, while he still remains unable to figure out things any human being with the IQ of a biscuit can hear (you'll know what I mean when Neo is aboard ship with Trinity). That was such a lame scene and I saw it coming like 10 minutes beforehand (including an intermission of about 5 minutes though). Saying this, I'm already at my next point of complaint and isn't it easy today? What is that complaint you ask? Well what abut the fact that this film is too predictable at times. I mean not just the usual, I was actually saying the lines of the characters in my head, before they uttered them themselves. How about that? That does not only mean that the lines were not good, but also that the scenes were not always good, or why else would I be thinking about what the character might say next?So far, one could conclude that I had a pretty shitty afternoon, watching this multi-million dollar slice of film-making, but that is not true. I was neither bored, nor mad. Instead, I was only slightly entertained and a bit disappointed. Especially with the ending. I could have done dealt with it, if the film had ended, when The Architect left, but the part that came after he left, what the hell was that all about? It did nothing, but leave me with some odd taste in my mouth (this is a figure of speech).The thing with this film is, that the original, inspiring and truly great thing that The Matrix was (and that Reloaded built on), was (in my opinion) destroyed with Revolutions. For me (an owner of The Matrix), this means that I will hold on to that copy for as long as I can, for it is a truly amazing film, but that I will not have anything to do with the other two parts. As far as I am concerned the story about The Matrix begins and ends with the first film. Not only because after seeing that film, you have about as much questions left as you have after seeing all three films, but also because the other films are just not too memorable. I'm really disappointed that Mr. and Mr. Wachowksi made two sequels and I must honestly say that I expected more from men who could invent such great stories as Bound and The Matrix. You know if there is nothing more to show, don't show it, just because you can get the money, or because all the actors have their autographs on a contract. If the sequels are not up to the original (in Revolutions' case NOT EVEN CLOSE), do not make them. I hope that the Wachowski's learn from this, that not all ideas are great and that not everything should be turned into a movie and in a way, I guess I hope that 'we' viewers learn that too. But, maybe I am to blame for expecting intelligent film-making.

post scriptum: while I was writing this comment I found out, that Gloria Foster, the 'original' Oracle, was not in this film, because  she died before her scenes for Revolutions were shot. I am very sorry to hear that, because she gave so much fun and flavor to The Matrix and The Matrix Reloaded. I must admit though, that I was a bit astounded as well, because there was no 'In loving memory of.' right after either Reloaded or Revolutions. I could continue my criticism about this film at this point, regarding the new oracle, but I will not. I just want to reemphasize that Mrs.Foster did a great job as the Oracle and that she will be missed.",7,0,0,15 November 2003
Grease," The good parts can not make the longer worse parts fade away
","This film certainly has it's quality, but the lesser parts are longer than the good parts and that actually sets most of the films score. Adding to that, the fact that I could really not feel for any of the characters or identify with them does not make it better. A bit of bun shaking by Newton John (or Travolta if you're a girl) does not make up for the lack of story and depth. Plus I've seen the 50's characterized better and cooler in Roadracers by Robert Rodriguez. If you like Rock and Roll watch Roadracers, if you like Grease and schmaltz watch this one.

Cast Away," The hell with Robinson Crusoe, go Chuck Noland
","This really is a great film, in which Tom Hanks succeeds again in starring in one of the best intro's to a film ever after Saving Private Ryan. The intro was so good, I almost got sick man and that means something. It really was heavy and much better than The Perfect Storm's disaster scenes. The Island part of the movie was also good and the return to home part was good too. Some people hated the ending though, but I liked it. It could have been longer, but it was still good, although I do not like having to make up my own ending. By the way, for people who think that after Chuck gets home, the movie stops, that ain't so and this can never be, bearing in mind the beginning and the fact that the director is Robert Zemeckis. Good fun, go see it.

Lilo & Stitch," Stitch rocks
","The biggest reason, to go and see this film is Stitch. What an amazing little creature. OK, I know he is supposed to be a scary monster, but who can resist that cute little head and that funny voice? This character does not have to say anything and can make you laugh harder than some comedians who think about a funny line or comment for about half an hour. The rest of the film is more or less standard' animated feature with a dramatic' sub-plot and a little love' theme'. The only thing that is not standard (except the cuteness of Stitch) is the great music by and inspired by the work of Elvis. I really liked that. First of all, because the music fitted well into the film and second of all because it is good music (even Stitch can't stay as evil' as he is supposed to be with that sort of music around!)

American Psycho," Emh..........well..........eh.........WHAT THE HELL was that?
","I do not quite know what the hell I saw the other night, watching this film, which is about a yuppie in the eighties who's got it all. He's got a good job in which he needs to do nothing, for his father owns the firm; he's got money; friends; a beautiful girlfriend plus he looks rather well. But somehow all of that has gotten into his mind and seriously screwed him up. He is just emotionless, greedy and narcissistic. That is about everything this film is about, it is a movie about the lifestyle of an eighties yuppie. There is not much more to it, because the film lacks excitement, graphic display of Bateman's deeds and explanation. I think the latter can be obtained by watching the film for the second time, but for the rest, you'll probably have to read the book. What killed' this movie though was it's lack of excitement (fear of Bateman or even thrills when you start wondering what he is up to next). This film is no classic at all, though I think it could have been, if Stanley Kubrick had directed it (even in the same way), for it reminds me a hell of a lot of A Clockwork Orange and because everything Kubrick made is regarded as a masterpiece (although I often do not get why). Without having read the book I can advise you, read it first and then, maybe watch this movie, for the special think about this story could not even be screwed up by the director, whereas the rest could be. Anyway the movie was pretty vague and somewhere between good and bad, which means it was somewhere between a 4 and a 8, so averaging those two grades this one gets a

Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," With the creator of the series gone, what is left of an epic story
","Many people, including I were very doubtful Terminator 3 would amount to anything, after the departure of James Cameron from the project. Other blows for fans of the series were that neither Edward Furlong nor Linda Hamilton would show up for the sequel and that not even William Wisher (who co-wrote both of the previous films wrote anything for this one). Instead the writers were people of little fame and the  director was not too famous as well, only having had a small hit' called U-571 in the year 2000 (grossing over 100 Million Dollars world-wide). The only comfort for the doubtful (such as I), was that Mario Kassar (producer of T2) and Gale Anne Hurd (producer and co-creator of The Terminator and producer of T2) were attached to the project as producers. It took a quite a time to cast T3 and it left me with mixed feelings. First it was said that Famke Janssen (the best Bond-girl ever) was to play the TerminatriX, but she turned it down. Then Edward Furlong was not going to be present as John Connor. By then I'd given up hope, that this could ever work. Then they cast Nick Stahl, who I extremely liked in Bully, as the new' John Connor and Claire Danes (of Romeo + Juliet fame) was cast as well. This looked more promising, but sold I wasn't. The trailer came along and I liked it pretty much, but still I stayed away from the big cinema and awaited the Terminators arrival at our local cinema. When he came I went, and when I left, I left satisfied.
Terminator 3 starts out with a great spoken intro by John Connor and then delves deeply into matter with which all Terminator fans are well accustomed too: Terminators arriving on earth after being sent back in time, desperately in the need of clothes. This is what all Terminator films start with and this though this one does so with a different type of approach. In the first part of the film, Arnold Schwarzenegger delivers a good one-liner after another and the action scenes are predominant (as they remain for the bigger part of the film). The one-liners are not always funny because of what is said, but because of the way it is said in and the facial expression Arnold makes when he utters the remarks. The action scenes are enormous and nothing short of spectacular (which is something I do not say easily, since I've seen a lot of action on film). This, along with some surprises in the story, are what keeps you on the edge of you seat for the ride and the only thing that could be considered drawback in this film, is the fact that the action sequences are too dominant at times.
But what about the times, when there are no action scenes? What about the acting? Well, Arnie was as good as ever in his role as the almost indestructible Terminator (although his last few lines were corny and almost overshadowed his entire performance). Claire Danes did an ok job and Nick Stahl was adequate as the new John Connor. Kristina Loken was ok as the T-X, but at times I felt that more could have done with her. Maybe they could have made more use of her looks and maybe they could have made her act a little less than the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) in T2. But hey, if everything was good, that would be the perfect scenario and hence, the perfect film! Whenever did you see that one?
Another drawback of the film manifests itself toward the end. There seems to be a desperate attempt by the makers of the film, to make Arnold say some memorable lines as he did in The Terminator and T2. I hate to say it, but they fall flat and almost ruin the ending. I said almost! Because when you think almost everything is done and the rest of the story is obvious, there is one surprise left for John and Kate (Claire Danes) and this is, what makes the film really worth while. Those last seven minutes or so, when John and Kate are on their own and when once again, there is a spoken part. That part only (together with the spoken intro) is worth the price admission. Really well done! The finishing touch comes with Brad Fiedel's theme, which I so dearly missed in the beginning of the film. Why oh why did they not play it at the beginning as well??? All in all this is good effort and the slightly worse' rating in comparison to The Terminator and T2 only stems from Arnold's last one-liners and the fact that this was more of a summer popcorn flick than were the other two.

Although I felt that sometimes things were just a little bit overdone and extreme I liked the film very much. A compliment to all of the crew and cast (especially Kevin Spacey). I didn't like Anette Bening that much in this one though, too weird at times, smackin' herself and stuff. There was some good humor (some of the sexual situations were hilarious) and a good moral to the story: be who you are and never forget that you control life and not the other way around.

Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Ultimately cool, though even masterminds make mistakes.
","Yesterday I watched Terminator 2 Judgment day THE ULTIMATE EDITION and I must say it is quite the experience. Not only the extra's and the menu screens, but the film is somewhat of a more 'complete' experience as well. I mean some of the 'new' scenes make a better or just another sense then they did before. I mean I do not want to ruin anything for anybody, but for anybody who wondered how to choose between 2, without hesitating is possible, this film shows it (I hope this was cryptic enough for those who haven't seen this film and specific enough for those who have). This ULTIMATE EDITION is really a great experience. Although it is filled up with about 15 minutes more than the original theatrical version it still is good. I mean there are no things added to this edition that I think should have been edited in the first place. Why the heck did they take these parts out, I wonder.
Anyway all the actors in this film are great. Linda Hamilton as the die - hard b..ch from hell. Edward Furlong as the lonesome kid, who hasn't got anybody really and of course Arnold Schwarzenegger. He just ROCKS. Ok say what you want about Schwarzenegger. I know he is no great character actor, but he does his job well and he has a certain kind of humor, which he also shows in this movie (as well as in True Lies). But that is not the fact that he is so great in this. The reason for that is rather the same as in THE TERMINATOR. He is excellently cast, with his muscular body and his grim face, along with the mechanical walk he adapted. He just makes the perfect machine. I miss out on the villain as well though, Robert Patrick, he is very cool too. A ruthless killing machine, without any regrets whatsoever.
Another thing that is really great here is the direction. Especially the scenes, that take place in the future and the action scenes. There is some blood squirting around when people go shooting, but despite that, this one is not as violent as the first one. I also think James Cameron did a great job in putting some critique about human behavior in it and also inserting some drama into the story and even the 'emotionless' cyborg. The special effects, once great are still good, although they are getting a bit old, just as the movie. But have no fear, it will not affect your viewing pleasure.
Despite the greatness, there is one thing I do not really understand here and that is how James Cameron, the mastermind could have made such a BIG, HUGE, ENORMOUS mistake in his story as I (obviously) witnessed. I mean, there are some minor things in this film that I think are not too good, like the fact that Cameron makes us believe Sarah is 29 in this film and John is 10 (which would have made Linda Hamilton 18 or 19 in the first movie!!!!), but this is really a FAULT and a big one. It is BIG in a sense that it could have been avoided easily, without ever hurting the film at all, whereas overlooking this fault, it kind of hurt the film from my view (if you did not notice THIS mistake, do not worry; I've seen this film about 8 times). Here it comes (BEAR IN MIND, THERE COULD BE SPOILERS HERE) : Remember when driving into the desert somewhere with Sarah (Hamilton) and John (Furlong), the Terminator (Schwarzenegger) tells them all about Skynet and how 3 years from then they will develop something leading to the nuclear blast in August 1997? (If you don't fast forward to that part). This is not possible within the story sketched, because the film takes place in 1995. Therefore something happening three years later (1998) could not have influence on something in August 1997. The big question now is, how the hell do I know this film takes place in 1995? Well, in the beginning when the T 1000 (Patrick) steals the cop car he looks up info about John Connor and when you look closely at the screen it says: Age: 10 and Date of Birth: something, something 1985. Well it hurts me to say this but this is a pretty obvious mistake, that could have simply been avoided by making Arnold say: 'In two years.' instead of 'In three years.' (POSSIBLE SPOILER END). Normal people might not spot this and I hope not to have sc..wed up somebody's film experience, but I just have always felt that there was something wrong with this films timeline. But now that I've finally spot it, I can enjoy this film at ease and admit that it is, in no way worse than it's predecessor, rather just not as original anymore, because when you see THE TERMINATOR shortly before this one, you just notice that there are a lot of similar scenes in both movies plus it is not as magic and amazing as it was before (that goes for every monster, machine or dinosaur sequel). Despite all that I can recommend everyone to go see the ULTIMATE EDITION, for it will bring you the MAXimized T2 film experience as it was meant to be.

Apocalypse Now," Did I miss something?
","Apocalypse Now is one of those classics' I did not find so classic at all. Maybe it is because I missed something, but I really do not understand what all the fuss is about here. The story develops very slowly, there is almost nothing of the horrorthe horror and although the insanity of war is presented by soldiers we see going nuts, we get no explanation for that insanity. It might be that I'm just too young, but maybe someone will be able to explain this films greatness' to me someday. Personally I believe, this film is so highly regarded, only because it was made shortly after the Vietnam war and handled some subjects the Americans rather hadn't seen on their plates. Marlon Brando certainly did the film some good but was not around long enough to make it good.

The Patriot," Can a German director capture the true nature of the American Civil War ?
","Apparently he can, for I really enjoyed this movie. OK I am not American, but that is probably why I just thought this movie is good (otherwise I would have thought it was great or excellent). You see, this film is the same as every other war movie that was made: It appeals most to the people whose history it is. For me it was like that with Saving Private Ryan (thought it was good (nothing more) cause it was not my battle')). Other feeling I have had though with Stalingrad, Das Boot and also (but less) with Die Brücke. I really liked those movies, because it shows the history of my people in World War II and I can imagine that as an American you think Saving Private Ryan was the best war movies ever made. But for me, the best American war movie ever made is Platoon. To get back to this one, this one is really good and I despise all of you who did not go and see it at the theater, and went to other idiotic films instead (like Mission to Mars or the recently released Little Nicky). You could have spent your money better.
By now you are probably wondering what was so good about this movie. Well here it comes, there were great war scenes, good emotional scenes, good directing, good music, good acting, funny parts, there were no slow or boring parts plus it was different than other war movies made recently (since Saving Private Ryan). What do I mean by that you wonder, well to understand that you have to acknowledge that this war was very different from World War II in it's whole setup. Here there were ideals involved in which men strongly believed and thought these beliefs were worth fighting for, so they enlisted in the army out of free will (almost all of them). In World War II it was just about to eliminate a threat, which was not direct to most Americans, seeing as the battle was not fought in their own backyard. It is the origin of the War that makes it so different, the whole history behind it and the motives of the people to either be on one side or the other.
The film itself has great scenes in it, my favorite ones are when Mel Gibson Rides off to leave his family for the second time, the two cannonball scenes and the ghost scene. Those scenes were great. The rest was all good, except for a few predictable / unrealistic ones at the end and that revenge scene. But after seeing such a good film, who cares about those minor mistakes'? This is no Braveheart but it still is good. I thank Mel Gibson, Roland Emmerich (for making a great comeback after Godzilla) and of course John Williams.

Face_Off," The Woo Meister strikes
","Well this is a good movie, the action is good, the story is OK (a wee bit unbelievable you may say, but this is an action flick and not a Spike Lee movie), the actors are good, from the lovely Dominique Swain, to Nicolas Cage (VERY GOOD, I like him a LOT, in almost every movie, due to his appearance) as both Troy and Archer and Travolta was good too, though not as good as Cage (Travolta is better in other roles, I didn't like his Archer, but the Castor he played rocked (such a cool father type)). The direction is well, if you know the name John Woo, you know what I mean. There are of course a few bad things here, a bit too much drama, crying and so on you sometimes feeling you have rented a Meryl Streep film. A little few action scenes but something really outstanding is shown here also, characters in an action film!!! The opening scenes are the best in this one, from the first kill, to where Troy is captured. HALLELUJAH!

Spider-Man," Spidey rules New York and the world
","It had been a long time since I had seen something of my beloved superhero Spiderman. I'd grown to love the Spider man TV, but I quit watching it, after I'd seen them all twice or so. I then later saw, that they were still making new ones, but I have to say, I'd kind of grown out of animated series. I never started do dislike the animated show, but you kind of grow out of all TV shows, because they run for much too long. This even happens when you love the show. You just can't help it. And after a while you start forgetting about your once loved ones' and you turn your head to new things. Yesterday I turned my head to a new old thing'. I turned my head to the Spider Man movie.
This movie was supposed to be big. It had made about 750 million  at the Boxoffice and it was listed among the best 250 movies at IMDB, but still I had my doubts. Why you ask? Well, I'd seen some of the music video's and they gave me the impression that the effects were really bad and that the film would be like Blade, a two hour music video. How wrong was I?
First of all, none of the songs from the Spider Man Soundtrack are featured in the film, like it is done in the Blade films. The songs can be heard in the background, playing on a radio or so. Second of all, although the effects were bad, I did not mind a bit, since the movie was so awesome, that I did not even notice most of the time.
What was great about the movie, you might ask? Well I can tell you what was not in a nutshell: the effects. The rest was pure genius and truly inspired by the comics and the animated series. First of all I have to give credit to the casting bureau. All of the parts were casted really well. Everyone fit in like a glove. Then credits of course go to the director (Sam Raimi) and the cast. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) came over as a real big nerd (even worse than I remember him in the animated series), M.J. Watson (Kirsten Dunst) was very gorgeous, charming and likeable and Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe) was really great as well. The scene, when he's talking to himself in the mirror was really great. The grimaces he made, from one shot to the next, were really awesome.
The director must also be credited, for bringing everything fabulously to the screen. I mean, there was nothing really innovative about it, but he was very solid and knew exactly what he needed and wanted. Last but not least I think I owe my thanks to the writers and to Danny Elfman. The writers of this film really succeeded in making up a story and dialogue in the film, that capture the figure that is Spider Man. He is a boy, who could be me (if he looked different). He was very human, a bit shy around magnificent beautiful women, a bit of a loner but basically a very nice guy. Then he gets to have extraordinary power. What is he to do? What will he become? What will happen to his loved ones? Throughout the film we observe the evolution of Peter Parker to become Spider Man. We see what power his new found strength brings and what responsibility. We see his powers upside, but also it's downside. So despite Peter Parkers nonhuman strength he remains a very human and normal figure which the viewer can relate to and that is what makes Spider Man such a great comic figure. A very big thanks to everyone involved for giving me the best two cinematic hours in a long time.

The Fast and the Furious," Standard, but good standard
","This film is really nothing mind blowing, when you consider the story, acting and stuff like that, but it is well made none the less. This could have been a TV film, hadn't it been for, well nothing really. This could have been an expensive TV film. It is just a crime story like there are hundreds out there, but the well filmed racing scenes, that keep you on the edge of your seat are well done and so is the entire film, which makes this standard car flick rise out of mediocrity.

Ocean's Eleven," Tricky
","This really is a beautifully shot film. The actors are all good (not great). The story is a very tricky one in the sense there are many things the director does not want the viewer to know, until it makes sense. However Soderbergh fails to create real thrills and tension in the viewer, although he has several aces up his sleeve. As beautiful as the film is shot it is at times too long. I bet the excellent cast (by reputation) had a wonderful time as so much great actors were combined in one film. It is not that I did not enjoy this film, but rather that it leaves a very odd taste in my nervous system. This is a film without much suspense, many thrills, laughs or anything above normal rate and despite some flaws still manages to entertain. It just has a certain something I cannot really name, although I suspect what it is. It is the fact that the job is pulled by decent criminals, led by the most decent, gentleman - like villain there ever was in film history, George Clooney. The fact that he is around gives this film extra charm that makes it worth seeing. George Clooney puts in that certain something.

Duck You Sucker," Plenty of explosions, but none of them will blow you away
","I've seen quite a number of Sergio Leone's films by now and I must say that I found this one to be the worst yet. I admit that I've seen worse films in general, but in no way can I recommend this one to you. If you want to see good Leone catch one of his films from The Man With No Name Trilogy or maybe even Once upon a Time in the West. I found the latter to be quite disappointing to be honest, but it was still better than A Fistful of Dynamite. There is almost no excitement, no coolness and the west is somehow robbed of it's roughness and interesting nature by motorized vehicles. Now I know that this is not supposed to be a film about gunslingers, but one about revolution and even in that aspect the film fails. First of all, the four flashbacks, which are supposed to give the film more depth, are misplaced, with the exception of the last two. They do not add anything to the film, or the preceding events and only make sense when (or if) you watch the movie until the end. Secondly, the film is just too long and not exciting enough to make you want to see the whole 158 minutes of it. Thirdly, I found it a bit strange that Coburn's Irish accent is apparent at one time and absent the next. Fourthly and maybe most sadly, the music of Ennio Morricone did not (as in many other movies) add anything to the experience, except maybe that it showed that the film is of mediocre quality in each end every aspect. No wonder scores from this film are likely to miss on any of Morricone's Best of records. Last but not least, I felt that as the film went on (or better dragged on), twists occur that made absolutely no sense to me. Concluding this comment I must say that this is a film I could have easily left off my list, but Leone is just too catchy a name for me. This one tumbles into oblivion rapidly after seeing and is not likely to be seen on any list, not even biggest disappointments. Films that have more famous names, though perhaps got better ratings by me, will have places on that list, like Once upon a time in the West (6 out of 10). The verdict for this one:

Resident Evil," Zombie flick with brains
","The mere idea of watching a zombie film is enough to give me the creeps, not because they are scary, but because every zombie film I've seen was bad and dumb. But lucky for me that I am not prejudiced and decided, in spite of my knowledge that there were zombies in this film, to watch it anyway. The thing that makes this zombie flick a good one, is that there is not too much emphasis on the zombies. They are there, but not all the time, because there are bigger, meaner and more complicated things to worry about which have been beautifully' engineered with computers and are quite original.
Other things that really made me enjoy this film, were the story, the acting and the directing. The story is a pretty complicated one for a zombie film and there are always a few surprises and enough tension to keep the film thrilling and exciting. The fact that the film continues to do that is mainly due to the good acting and the good directing, which we all know if worse enough can screw up a potentially good film. This does not happen here though. Mr.Anderson and his actors have (according to me) succeeded in bringing the first good zombie film onto my TV screen.

Gone with the Wind," Gone with the Wind? Not yet!
","It is really amazing that even now, over 60 years later this film can still be enjoyed. I mean comedic standards change, filmmaking techniques change, special effects change and so on. But all that did not made a difference to this films class. The jokes still work, the set decoration is good, the battle scenes and effects are still good (even nowadays and I didn't even watch the restored version from 1998), the film has a couple of great shots and a lot of diversity. But it is the effort and class of the two leading actors that make this film so good and worth while. Vivian Leigh is just perfect as the breathtaking and naive yet selfish and cruel Scarlett whereas Clark Gable pulls off the best ungentlemanly yet likeable money chaser I've ever seen. The combination of these two is really great, with Scarlett always whining and pretending to be such a poor, poor girl while Clark Gable makes fun of her and enjoys it himself extent.
The thing that I found most amazing though was that although I felt not for Scarlett until the very end of the film, I found myself in the same situation as Rhett Butler. I fell for the charm of Scarlett and I must say, I sometimes hated myself for loving her. This is a classic film in many ways and one I must say I cannot imagine they will remake soon, because everyone who has seen this film, has the characters as they were portrayed by Clark Gable and Vivian Leigh imprinted into their memory forever.

Remember the Titans," Another good Bruckheimer
","Jerry Bruckheimer is commonly known to make films with big explosions and a lot of actions, but he also knows how to make a good thematic film, which he has shown us by making for example Dangerous Minds. This is yet another one of those great films, which have a thematic element and good actors to deliver a message to people and I think that the biggest achievement in making this film is, not to glorify it too much or to Â‘Americanize' it with big emotions (like Armageddon). Well done.

Batman Begins," Over-rated
","Of course this film has it's good points, especially when it is compared to the other Batman films. It is darker, less aimed at children, funny input by Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine and !!!OF COURSE!!! the best Batman ever (Christian Bale).What about all the bad points? The whole 'Karate-kid' beginning, the lack of a good villain, the lack of originality, the cheesy hint at 'Batman Continues' (or whatever it will be named), the superficial character that is Mr. Gordon (a man of Gary Oldman's talent is wasted here), the bad editing (I just could not figure many of the fight scenes out...I like them kick-ass...Michael Keaton Style), the bad love interest (really...what's her name is awful). I could continue...but I won't. Sure this is just the beginning but keeping the above in mind, the scale can go BOTH ways. The beginning is OK, the character is SET, now (please) BLOW US AWAY (and don't try and do it by blowing more stuff up and creating idiotic stunts and villains).6,75 out of 10 (with a tiny seven given upon voting, although the film is highly overrated, being # 111 in the top 250)",5,2,4,5 January 2006
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Worst Spielbergian Cinema offering of the 90's
","I've seen a lot of films in my time, but never have I seen a master of cinema (like Lucas, Cameron, Zemeckis) make such a bad film after he was established as a director. I mean this is (looking at it from a Spielbergian perspective) a piece of CRAP!!! I mean, if you're a 2rd rate director this would have been a pretty good effort, but as far as a genius like Spielberg goes, this is no work of art at all. It lacks everything that was the greatness of Jurassic Park:1. A great soundtrack (where are those epic, emotional tunes Mr.Williams)2. A good story (Mr.Crichton, don't let anybody ever tell you again to write a sequel if you don't have a good story in mind)3. Good actors (no offense to Mrs.Lewis, but she can do better, as well as (pretty much) the rest of the cast members)4. Great direction (sorry Mr.Spielberg, you failed here)5. The feeling of an adventure movie (I don't know what this was supposed to be, but it doesn't occur to me as an adventure movie. Sometimes I had the feeling Spielberg was making a parody of his own masterpiece Jurassic Park. B-grade Godzilla-esque acting, disaster'  scenes and stupid jokes that fell flat.6. A good length (this one is way too long)Wrapping it up, I must say that it is a shame this one even got to tag along the name Jurassic Park after it's Title (The Lost World) and I'd rather had Jurassic Park 3 made directly after the original. But luckily The Lost World and Jurassic Park 3 are not stringed together. (Technically you could have even named JP3, Jurassic Park 2, for this one is called The Lost World: Jurassic Park. WHY OH WHY did nobody think of THAT???)

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," A waste of money or the dawn of an epic Trilogy?
","I must start by saying, that at the end of this review you will get two ratings from me. One for the first time I saw the film (December 19th) and a second one for the second time I saw it (January 12th). I watch films like this (and Star Wars films) two times in the cinema, because I feel that I am too overwhelmed by the visuals at the first time to really capture the whole film. Another reason, why I do not enjoy The Lord of the Rings as much at my first view, is that I've read the books. This means that I (while watching the film) start wondering how they've done this and that and ask myself: What came next?'. This of course prevents me from getting deep into' the film, but unlike other films it does not totally spoil my viewing experience. The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers (together with a limited number of other films) are the only ones, that can make me shed a tear, even when I'm not that able to plunge into' the story.
After the big success and the quality adaption, that The Fellowship of the Ring was, the expectations for the Two Towers were enormous. Not only for the general public, but for me also, even despite the fact that I thought that The Two Towers was the worst' book of the trilogy ( with The Return being just a notch better than The Fellowship of the Ring). I obviously cannot say yet, that The Two Towers is my least favorite film, but what I can say, is that it was not as good as the first film. This has nothing to do with the actors (even though Ian McKellen isn't as great as he was in The Fellowship of the Ring), the effects or the story. Contrary to what some might think now it has also nothing to do with the fact that Peter Jackson added a few scenes,left some out and even delayed the appearance of Shelob until the last film although it has something to do with the artistic freedom' Peter Jackson permitted himself in making this film. The only thing that really bugs' me about this film is (and I know I'm going to sound like one of those idiotic Tolkien freaks) that it did not quite grasp the essence of the book, of the whole trilogy for that matter, for The Lord of the Rings is basically about Frodo's quest to destroy the Ring of power in the fires of mount doom and it is my opinion that this part of the story did not get enough attention throughout the film. While I was reading the book, I could fully understand Frodo's difficulty with the ever heavier growing ring, that started to poison his mind and caused a lot of struggle within Frodo. A struggle in which he was all by himself, for nobody knew what it was like and nobody could help him bear this ever growing burden. Peter Jackson (obviously) tried to bring that part of Frodo's feelings onto the screen, but in my eyes he failed. The terror of the Ringwraith's and the inner struggle within Frodo were much better depicted in The Fellowship of the Ring than they were in this film despite the fact that it was an essential part of the 2nd book of the trilogy. Now I know that this film has been cut (as The Fellowship of the Ring had been) to reach a wider audience and to earn back the BIG bucks that were invested in the making of this trilogy, so I can only hope that Peter Jackson cut essential parts out of the film instead of forgetting to forge a good second chapter of what is and could become an epic and classic trilogy on paper and on film respectively.

The Incredibles," Suck on that 007
","I'll be the first one to admit that The Incredibles has a rather weak core story. It's a simple, familiar and easily conceivable good guy vs. bad guy routine and the basic plot becomes apparent very early into the film. This despite the fact that the actual bad guy is not exposed an until about an hour into the film. Now this set-up might work for 6-10 year old's, but it certainly doesn't work for the average adult watching this film. Despite falling into the latter category myself (being 23 years young) I neither found this simple core story annoying nor did I feel that it took anything away from the fun that became and is The Incredibles. Fact is, that the the great characters, the familiar situations, the great visuals and music all add up to make the simple set-up fade away into oblivion.I was particularly impressed by the apparent ease in which Brad Bird fused superhero and espionage elements with everyday situations every person knows so well. Especially family themes as upbringing and aging were addressed very truthfully and at times I felt myself chuckle, because it all seemed so familiar (either from own experience, or because I know people like that). These familiar situations along with the careful build-up of the story, are crucial for this film, because they allow it to last 2 hours without becoming boring and slow.While The Incredibles may be very predictable at times, I still felt that the whole was very original. One example of this originality is the fact that everybody's super powers became useful (specifically and individually) in the end. In my mind, it is simply amazing what Brad Bird accomplished with this film and in my humble opinion The Incredibles is the best Bond film since Goldeneye (1995). But not only that, it is also the best Pixar film since Toy Story 2 or maybe ever (beating the (for me) disappointing, yet highly successful Finding Nemo with incredible ease), Disney's best animated feature probably since Hercules AND one of the best films of 2004. The film might not be as comical and hilarious as Disney's previous offerings, but it still is one of the best films the company has brought forward and it definitely deserves to win the Oscar for best animated feature. I for one CANNOT wait for the sequel, although I hope in the end they'll do better than what they ended with.8,25 out of 10 post scriptum: maybe I suck as a movie critic and I should stop writing reviews, but I enjoy it too much and luckily you're not forced to read this.

Driven," I thought that Daylight was the low-point, but...
","after making a slightly better film with Copland Stallone has fallen back to that low-point that was Daylight. This film is just crap. I mean I did not expect too much of a story or brilliant acting, but I did expect great action. There was none. In a truly great car film, when there is enough good action, the poor script is not important, but if even the action sucks, nothing is left. What I do not understand, is how Renny Harlin could make this effects disaster. The special effects really suck above everything else and look like they've been ripped from a computer game. I'm sure Harlin could have made a film with a better effects (like Deep Blue Sea) or at least a better story (The Long Kiss Goodnight). The only thing I liked a bit about this film, was the abundance of German celebs. I found it quite entertaining to see them pop up. There was of course Til Schweiger (an actor who some might have seen in The Replacement Killers), Jasmin Wagner (a singer - presenter also known as Blümchen or Blossom in other countries) and Verona Feldbush (a presenter with a dummie image and a lousy actress (she didn't say a word in this film, I WONDER WHY!!!)).

Coyote Ugly," Good film and great fun
","First of all I must say that I was pretty disappointed in the cover of this film, which had me believing that Rachel (Bridget Moynahan) was the hottest of the five, while in the film she was the ugliest Coyote. The rest all more or less made an impression similar to the one on the box. But on to the film itself. I liked it and I liked it a lot. You can call me a romantic ba***rd but still I liked it. Almost everything about it. Ok I admit this is a film with not much depth or twists but it is really great fun from the moment 'Jersey' (Piper Perabo) leaves her house to the predictable ending. The best scenes in my opinion the ones in which we see 'Jersey' singing her own songs (damn she, or better LeAnn Rimes, can sing) and it makes me wonder why the Can't fight the Moonlight became the single for this movie.
Moving on, there is everything you could possibly want in this movie, hot chicks, dancing, romance, fights, comedy and last but certainly not least a good deal of great music. All the actors and actresses are good, but I especially liked seeing John Goodman again in a good part. Highly recommended because highly enjoyable. Plus it just might change your perspective on life.

Moulin Rouge!," A Marvel of sights and sounds
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** This film, set in 1899 is really one of the most original films for years, that has big names and big bucks in it. I must say I was really astonished in how Baz Luhrmann was able to merge the feeling of a 1899 nightclub with modern 20th century music. I mean there were so many modern love songs mingled into the story and singing, I sometimes wondered if the writers had come up with anything of their own. But disregarding the fact that they were all existing songs I have to admire the way they were integrated into this film. That was really a job well done. First of all (for most of them and the ones I recognized) they were rearranged and then the parts were sung by actors and/or some singers. Then there was the enormous variety of genre's the songs were from, without even disturbing one another. I mean there was grunge, soul, pop and rock, with songs like (QUEEN - The Show Must go On; THE POLICE - Roxanne; THE BEATLES - All you need is Love; MADONNA - Material Girl and Like A Virgin; WHITNEY HOUSTON -  I'll Always Love You; NIRVANA - Smells Like Teen Spirit; KISS - I Was Made For Loving You; DAVID BOWIE - Heroes and PATTI LA BELLE - Lady Marmalade). I only list the songs I recognized (and remembered) and their original artists as far as I can remember them, because I do not know who sang them in the film. The mingling of these various popular and famous songs of different genre's into a film about a brothel in the late 20th century is an accomplishment of itself.
As in regards to the story, I feel there is nothing much to say, first of all it is a film about love. And one with a tragic ending (no spoilers here, because Ewan McGregor will reveal this himself within the first 5 minutes of the film). For this it is comparable with the 3 greatest love stories ever told in history (GONE WITH THE WIND, TITANIC and DRACULA). It just has everything to become an instant classic. It is set (as the other three films) in a time where there is no (or not much) electricity and that gives it something of 'the good old days' feeling with a bit of a more romantic feeling, for that was the time when men were still gentlemen and romanticism had it's peak.
As far as the film goes there are three things that stand out. First of all the direction of Baz Luhrmann, who (again) after Romeo and Juliet succeeded in giving a story set in the past something of a modern look. His vision and direction of this story is really great and combines to make this the sights and sounds spectacle it eventually came to be (Oscar nominee for directing I guess, but no award).
Then there are the decorations and the costumes, which are really great and visually so demanding that you become lost in them and are thereby dragged into this romantic, humorous and tragic musical of epic proportions (An Oscar for costumes and a nomination for Art Direction / Set decoration)
Well, as should be done in a film, I saved the highlight for last. The best thing about this film is.....Nicole Kidman. No offense to the other actors who all did a good job, but she really outshone everyone of them, she was superb, magnificent, extraordinary simply put she was just GREAT. She was very, very convincing as the courtesan that wished to be more, that wished to fly away but.well I'm not revealing more than the first five minutes of film do.dies in the end. With that in mind one might predict the ending (as I somehow did) and not like this film, due to predictability. I mean I am not saying that this film should get an award (or even a nomination) for best story or screenplay. No, what I am saying is that this film is so visually exciting and gripping that it overcomes predictability and surges to a highpoint, only to be picked up by Nicole Kidman who takes this film even higher to the top of the mountain, to greatness. Despite that I'm not saying that this film landed on the highest mountain ever, but it sure is in the area nearest to the moon and stars. Leaving behind any movie I've seen this year. Therefore it is in my opinion unavoidable that this film will get the Oscar for best movie (I know it somehow will). For it is by far the best movie of the year 2001.
And the Oscar for best actress goes to (well it will anyway): NICOLE KIDMAN (standing ovations please!!!)

Meet Joe Black," A chronically underused Forlani shines between Pitt and Hopkins
","Meet Joe Black is one of those films, that did not exactly was the way I expected the film to be. This, I am certain had a lot to do with the nature of the trailer and the things I've heard other people say about it. Just to maker it clear: yes Meet Joe Black is something of a romantic film and yes it is probably best enjoyed (especially at certain moments) with your girlfriend, but there is much more to this film that just the romantic side. This film is also funny, enchanting (in a non-romantic way), utterly entertaining and intriguing. The credit for creating a compelling story, that never gets boring (despite the films length), certainly must be given to Martin Brest (of Beverly Hills Cop fame), but he couldn't have done it without his actors and one actress in particular. Brad Pitt (Joe Black) and Anthony Hopkins (Bill Parrish) certainly are the main focus of the story, because it the main point is an agreement they both have and the story between Bill's daughter Susan (Claire Forlani) is just' a by product of that. But I will not focus too much on the story, as most of you will probably know that Pitt plays death who has come to earth to get Parrish, whose time has come. Instead I'd like to focus on the great people in from of the screen. Now most of you / us know that Brad Pitt is a wonderful actor and I must truly say that he is able to show it here again. His portrayal of death experiencing what it is to be alive for the first time was really great and I must say that I thought he even outperformed Hopkins. This is not to say that Anthony Hopkins was bad, on the contrary he was good, but just not as top notch as Pitt. Standing there right between those two like a hill between the mountains was Claire Forlani, who was exceptionally well cast as young Susan. I think not enough credit has been given to this beautiful young lady. I think it is quite an accomplishment to stand in the middle between Hopkins and Pitt and still be able to stand tall and not be blown away by the talent and ability those two actors possess. I also think it is a pity that an actress so beautiful and talented has not been cast in bigger, more successful films in the past 5 years. What kind of films are the casting people looking for references anyway? Forlani would rule as a Bond girl, she could play an Austin Powers film, she could even do great character work in A Beautiful Mind like film if someone would let her. I admit that she's too cute for some parts, hey but there must be other roles out there for her than the one she's getting lately. I admit that she does some low budget films, but as all actors and actresses I'm certain that she'd like to be in big production every now and then like she has been in The Rock and Meet Joe Black. Therefore and because I think she's a good actress I hope that The Limit (with Jackie Chan) will do her career some good and that she'll get more credit for her work as an actress besides that Saturn Nomination for Meet Joe Black for I feel that she is CHRONICALLY UNDERUSED in good and big productions that can make her name a household one. I mean she certainly starred with some good and famous actors the past few years, but why must the productions always be so cheap and bad?
While I was going on and on (sorry to have bored you) about Claire Forlani, I mentioned a nomination for a Saturn Awards in Meet Joe Black. A few Saturn Award nominations were actually the only indications of this films quality, which makes me wonder if anyone of the academy or golden globe folks have watched this film? I for one, feel that Pitt and Forlani should at least have gotten Globe nominations and I also feel that there cloud have been an Oscar nomination for the wonderful Cinematography or the set decoration. But since this film got nothing but a few Saturn nominations, a worst remake nomination and an award for worst film I MUST BE MAD. Even if I am, I still know I liked it from beginning to end.

Pi," Requiem for Pi
","I've watched both of Aronofsky's critically acclaimed films by now and I must say, I do not find them good. There are interesting elements, but the films are not interesting. Take Pi for example. The shaky cinematography, by the emphasis on the madness of Maximillian rather than on Maximillian himself, made it very difficult for me to get into' the film or even figure out what was real and what was not. Despite that criticism I have to admit, that the mathematical parts of this film were interesting and somewhat ingenious. 
My criticism does not mean that either Pi or Requiem for a Dream are bad films, I just want to say that they're not all they are cracked up to be and that I therefore would not recommend them film to anybody. I'd rather see Donnie Darko, Bully or Irrèversible again. I guess what I want to say is: Aronofsky is just not for me and I dare say that if you did not like Requiem for a Dream too much, you the same will probably go for Pi and the other way around.

"Good Night, and Good Luck."," For American's Only
","I watched this movie tonight and while I did so, I actually started to wonder whether this film was made for the American market only. For me as a European, not knowing much about the 50's in America and the whole communism thing, a lot about the film was incomprehensible. I felt that the editing was not too great, the story lines were not elaborate enough and all concluding I felt that the whole impact of the McCarthy affair and his 'hunting' of communists in the USA was not depicted 'in depth'. Maybe this film was more about the people working at CBS at the time and their struggles with the politics of the day. But fairly, given Clooney's reputation, I had imagined a more in depth look into the whole and not just a scattered glimpse of a part.5 out of 10",5,1,8,25 November 2006
Mulholland Drive," A film that is like sleeping
","The nice thing about this film is, that you can discuss it for hours with other people who have seen it. That fact however, is also the only thing which is bad about this movie. Since you are never quite sure what you've just seen, you're really not that sure how good the film was. Sure the acting and directing were good, but what was it all about? Well I think there are two approaches to making sense of this film. The first one would be to try and piece the fragments together into a story and the second one would be to accept what you have seen as a fact. What the latter means I will get to in a minute, but I first want to remind you that different directors want to make you feel different things. (possible spoilers ahead) Some want to make you experience laughter, others sadness and yet others want you to experience a dream. You see I do not think that there is a story behind the inconsistencies, I think the whole film was a depiction of a dream. Have you never had a dream, that made no sense, but being weird? Have you never had a dream that was disturbing yet inexplicable? Did the fact that the events didn't really occur make it less thrilling? Did it not leave you dazed and confused? Mulholland Dr. is such a dream. If you've never had one of those dreams before you can now rent one. If you've had such a dream, this is your chance to experience yet another one, which you are not likely to forget as fast as most of your own dreams. (possible spoilers end) For those who want to understand Mulholland Dr., ask David Lynch, for those who like to wonder, continue to do so.

Kill Bill: Vol. 1," The Tarantino Pentathlon Part 1 - The beginning of his return: Kill Bill Vol. 1
","Not much of a story, but well executed
You know what the problem is with living in a small ass town in the southern part of the Netherlands? The problem is, that if you are unable to attend a screening of a film like Kill Bill, in it's first two weeks, no cinema within a 25 kilometer radius still has the film running on a big screen. Now that's what I call a problem! And how is one supposed to solve that? Watch Kill Bill on a small ass screen?? SOD THAT! Wait until it is released on video?? HELL NO!! So what does one do? One travels about 85 kilometers to the first big town, spends twelve bucks on the train-ticket, an additional 8,30 for the entrance fee in a multiplex far far away from home. In conclusion, one spends a hell of a lot of money and three hours on the train for about two hours of Tarantino on a big screen. When one has done all that, what do one do then you guess? Well, then One hopes that the film does not suck and let me tell you it doesn't.
The beginning of Kill Bill is quite rough and that sets the tone for the rest of the film, which is constructed the same way as Pulp Fiction, regarding the fact that the story is not told in it's chronological form. Now I agree with the critics with the fact that Kill Bill does not have too much of a story, but one can see that there is still much to come in Volume II. Not only is The Bride's kept secret from the audience, but the really great and in also surprising ending hints at somewhat more story and more surprises in the second film.
I must say that I am a fan of Tarantino's work as a director and I found it astonishing that even with this film he managed to surprise me, for Kill Bill is unlike any of his other films. It bears somewhat a resemblance with Jackie Brown, with which Q dived deeply into another genre of movie-making and that is exactly what he does with Kill Bill. Kill Bill is a martial arts, revenge film, with spaghetti western and anime influences that I must say he mixed astonishingly well, despite having a bit of a with the animated chapter in the film myself in the beginning.
The music in the film is (once again) great and the characters, although not all are elaborate and some seem quite shallow are characterized in a believable and good way by the actors. Besides Uma Thurman, who portrays the Bride, I especially liked Lucy Liu as O-Ren Ishii. The character she portrayed suited her very well and she pulled off the mean and devilish little 'godfather' with style. If Lucy did a really good job, I must say that Uma RULED. I mean she just acted in great fashion and I think this film is her best performance since Pulp Fiction. Maybe some would say that it is even better acting-wise. I do not want to be the judge on that and the only thing I can say is that she is as great as The Bride as she was as Misses Mia Wallace. If you don't believe it, watch the film and especially the 'wake-up' scene. If you don't think that is great acting, you're probably still in the 'Stallone is the best actor ever' phase.
The film itself, (yes you read and heard correctly everywhere) is quite brutal, with limbs flying around and blood gushing out of wounds as it does in manga films at times. But the fact is that in my opinion it could have been (and needed be) much more brutal. The thing I am referring to here is the Massacre at the House of Blue Leaves. I mean what the heck was Q thinking when he made the switch from colored film to black and white? Or does this relate to the fact that the American and European version is much less violent than the Asian version of the film? Is it all in color over there and did the film manage to get an R rating because the blood and killing were in black and white instead of being in color? Well I do not know, but I had some real difficulty with the film switching to black and white and I think I would have enjoyed the killing more if it had been in color. I guess I'll see what that was all about when this film comes out on DVD.
The carnage and destruction in Kill Bill never gets boring or ridiculous (as it did in Matrix: Revolutions) and despite the fact that some things need getting used to, Kill Bill: Volume I is a film that makes 110 minutes seem pretty short indeed. I agree that there is not much of a story, but then again, the stories of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction were not too elaborate either. The thing with Tarantino is, that his execution of a story is always top-notch (including this film). This film may not be as thrilling as Reservoir Dogs, as cool as Pulp Fiction, as complicated and mysterious as Jackie Brown, but I sure as hell enjoyed myself and certainly did not regret having spent so much time and money, since in the end I got something back as well. I for one can't wait until 2004, when The Bride will FINALLY Kill Bill.

From Dusk Till Dawn," True Tarantino
","This is weird, this is gore this has profanity, in one word (actually three) this is TARANTINO. This is the best splatter movie I've seen man, although I must say, I don't actually see it like that myself, because this is not meant to be a splatter film , because it kind of makes fun of those movies. This one is great though very very funny, very gory and weird, but I like it that way. Only bummer here, not too great special effects. Great performances by Tarantino and Clooney (they rule), Juliette Lewis and Harvey Keitel are not too bad either. If ya like Tarantino, see this, man, he didn't write the story, but watch the flick, I'm sure he wrote all of the dialogue man!!! That sure is Tarantino's work 7 out of 10",7,8,13,7 May 2000
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Charlie versus Willy
","As of last week I've seen both versions of the famous Roald Dahl book and I must conclude in saying that they both have good bits and bad bits. Let me begin with this film. While I liked the overall cheerful tone of the film, I thought that Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) who explicitly lacked that cheerfulness was not a very likable character. Johnny Depp's acting was good, but the character he portrayed just didn't fit the bill. Whilst the 1971 version depicted Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) was a funny and cheerful village idiot, Tim Burton reduced the character to an odd, eccentric and cold individual that I just could not connect with. Regarding the cheerful tone of the story, I liked the approach taken to Willy Wonka in 1971 better.This film also introduced a back story, not shown in the 1971 version, which is told in flashbacks and which does not add anything of importance to the story. It only takes away some of the mystery surrounding that village idiot who seems to be obsessed with making innovative sweets. Also I do not quite like the way in which Tim Burton introduces those flashbacks and at most times they are more annoying than they are helpful to enjoying the film.Another annoyance in this film are the Oompa Loompa's. While they were sweet and funny in the original, the amount of songs and on-screen time they have in Tim Burton's film is irritating. It is not because of the acting as such, but the songs they play are very annoying and they take you right out of the enjoyable film experience. You just want them to stop and get back to the story, instead of enjoying what they have to tell you.What I liked about this film though was the nut-peeling sequence and anything I did not get annoyed by (excluding the massive amount of CGI, which I felt could have been toned down). Nonetheless, I think that despite the (big) flaws, Tim Burton delivers a good film with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which makes the fact that there were flaws present bearable on one end of the spectrum and pitiful on the other. Bearable because the rest was so good you kept enjoying it and pitiful because had there been NO flaws, this film could have been one of the best movies ever made. As it is, the film is good, cheerful and enjoyable. Heck, it even left me smiling for minutes after leaving the theater. Still I was not completely satisfied.7,75 out of 10 (with an 8 given upon voting)",8,0,0,16 September 2005

Black Snake Moan," The most stupid, sexist movie I have seen in a long time
","I thought this movie could have been quite good, but actually it failed miserably. What is sold here is Christina Ricci's body as we see her walking around naked (and may I say needlessly so) throughout most of the film. It has no depth, does not go into the childhood abuse enough and does not portray Laz's (Samuel L. Jackson) chaining Rae (Christina Rcci) as brutal as it is. Instead it tries to portray it as slightly 'funny' or as a 'game'.Also what is this uncontrollable 'sickness' Rae has? If the director would have wanted this to be a 'religously' themed movie, he could have done so much better and not have brought a 15th century concept of 'witch' into the über-sexy environment of the 21st century.Awful cinema, which nobody should be exposed to, especially not 12-17 year old who will go and see this nonsense. As far as I am concerned, the only decent thing in this film was the music! 3 out of 10",3,5,19,2 February 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," Monkey madness, space ballet and an out of psychotic computer
","With 2001 Stanley Kubrick succeeded in merging monkey madness, space ballet and an out of control computer by the use of an odyssey through space and time. What he did not succeed in, was in making a good film. Of course, by the standards of the time (1968) the effects were incredible and so were the monkey costumes (compare them with Planet of The Apes, which is also from 1968), but innovation hardly makes a film great. An interesting plot eventually combined with an intriguing style of filming does and that is where Kubrick went wrong with this one.
The first 15 Minutes of the film (I watched the 139 minute version), entitled The Dawn of Humankind' made up the best part of the movie. I especially liked the ending of that piece, when the music set in, fading into the space part of the film incredibly well. What followed this amazing transition was an amazing piece of space ballet. A real feast for the eyes. Then I guessed the stylish' part was over and the film would begin. I was wrong. In the 1 hour and 40 minutes to come there would be numerous overlong scenes of space ballet that added nothing to the plot and became quite boring over time, as did the whole film. Some of the scenes were quite pointless (in addition to being soundless). The part with the HAL 9000 computer was OK as well, but actually that about sums it up.
There is of course a storyline in this film, and it does connect monkey madness to an out of control computer by means of space ballet, but the way in which it is done just doesn't hold my attention. The space ballet could have been abandoned, because it did not connect monkeys to computer by means of causality but only by means of choice as did the vividly colorful voyage at the end. Sure the cinematography is great and the effects are amazing, but those two things are not the only things that make a movie.

Toy Story," Just missing that extra something
","This first entirely computer animated film by Disney is a pretty good effort, but the film seems lacks that extra something, that makes it good. The action, which does not seem to stop is only' pretty thrilling and the film overall is only' kind of funny (I didn't burst out with laughter once). Therefore this film can not achieve the rating good (8 out of 10) by me, for a good film (in my opinion) is good on more than just one or two levels and it has to cover the entire film (preferably exceeding in more than one genre). Nonetheless this is (again) no disappointment by Disney.

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Not spotless, but good nonetheless
","The Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind, although being somewhat dramatic throughout, is nothing than a feel-good movie in the end. What I liked most about the film, were the beginning and the ending. Especially the beginning though, I think, which was very romantic and well made. But the ending was good as well, because it did more than conclude the somewhat weird happening from the middle of the film, it provided a sort of a morale, a tip maybe for people in love and for couples all over the world (or is that just me who got that feeling?). As for the middle of the film, it was a tad weaker than the beginning and the end, yet in it's numerous 'rehearsals' of the same it never bored or dragged as it might have if there had been worse actors or a worse director. As far as the latter is concerned, he did a good job, but WHAT ABOUT THE ACTORS? Damn, they were great. Well they were all good, and Kate Winslet was great. Maybe it has to do with me being a bloke, or me thinking she is sexy or maybe I just have a bit on a crush on her (or maybe I'm delirious RIGHT NOW) but she really played her character excellently. I just loved her and I could just imagine, sitting there, how it must have been for Clementine with Joel and for Joel with Clementine and yet I felt it was more due to Winslet's performance than with Carrey's. I do not know what it is with her, and I definitely DO NOT like all of her movies (although I've seen a lot and hate none). I sense an Oscar nomination for both her and Carrey. Although I think she'll walk away with one (for this OR Finding Neverland which I have not seen yet) and Carrey will not.7,5 out of 10 (with a spotted 8 given upon voting)",8,0,1,30 October 2004
The Mummy Returns," A good return
","Well first of all I must say that when I watched this movie, I was not in the movie mood. Not because somebody dragged me to the cinema to see this film, I simply couldn't pull it off to get in the right mood. I mean I would not have gotten into' this movie if I had one of them Last action Hero tickets'. But maybe all that just has me looking at the film a bit more objectively or maybe it just has me seeing some of its flaws better.
First of all I must say that in this film there is an almost uncountable amount of effects, way more than in the first part and I must say that the guy I was watching it with was right when he said: This was almost as full of effects as Star Wars Episode 1. That did no harm in this film though. There were actually only a few things that really did. First of all there is The thing with the message bird' that I think is not correct, for birds can only run messages around if the guy that is supposed to get them stays at one point and one point only. Second of all the (SPOILERS AHEAD???!!!) the figures made of sand by the boy are much too good and pretty and third of all I really dislike two scenes on the air transport. First scene is the Oh I want my son back  weeping' scene and the second is the flashback  falling scene'. It is only the almost falling that bugs me, for the rest it is a great scene. A thing I also disliked is, that I immediately knew Evelyn was going to be resurrected with the book of the dead, after she died (SPOILERS END!!!). Also I thought that the guy who played Jonathan did not do too well some times and really stank, just like the cheering scene of the good guards'.
That is it for the bad parts then (oh wait did I mention that Imotheps lady love was not as pretty as I thought she would be after that first glimpse in The Mummy + Rachel Weisz looked better in the original too). But that's only for shallow people and it is only my opinion and perhaps the only opinion of that kind in the world. Getting to the good stuff, the direction was good, the effects were good, the acting was good (except Jonathan (see above)). There were a couple of good jokes (some even mocking the genre (not quite as much as Scream though)) some of which were very obvious, while others were less (like the one in the beginning with all the scorpions in the mummy filled room). What I really liked though was the great music and the epic, emotional feeling the film sometimes delivered. This is a film that is at no times boring and even though I never really left the seat to become one with the characters, the story and the action I enjoyed this film

Toy Story 2," I'm really starting to enjoy this
","After viewing the first one I must say I was not sure this film would be good, since I thought the original, Toy Story, was an average film. But I thought: Hey it is Disney, so how bad can it be?' And guess what I was right. This is a good movie and in my opinion a better one than the first, but after seeing this one I'm sure I'm going to watch the original again in the near future.
What I really liked about this movie, was that it was not only pretty funny (especially Rex the dinosaur and Buzz Lightyear) but that there was plenty of action, excitement and last but not least a lot of emotion. It really showed us, especially young kids, how many of treat our toys. This movie is a good reason to hold on to all of your old stuff or give it away to other children and not just to throw it away, for it will be of great emotional value to you some day too. But this is not just a kids movie. Adults will enjoy this one too, because of some great jokes involving movies (the Star Wars stuff was really hilarious). Of course not everything was great. I especially liked Woody, Rex and Buzz, but there was also one irritating little character and that one was the Cowgirl Jessie, she was just too happy and that made her annoy me sometimes, but hey, characters are different and you need not like everybody and Jessie being irritating did not cause me not wanting Woody to help her so there is just one more thing for me to say: WELL DONE Disney, the Toy story keeps getting better and I'm already looking forward to Toy Story 3.

","This movie (of course) featured German's on their best, when they are mean, evil and last but not least almost inhuman. For the rest there is not much to say about this average movie, with a couple of big names' and a crappy ending, which is so dumb and predictable it ruined a perfectly average movie and made it quite cheap.

Mission: Impossible," Well, pretty good I must say (critics: Remember what the title says Impossible, so prepare)
","With all the talk going on about Mission Impossible 2 I watched this one again (for the 2nd time) yesterday as a warm  up (Mission Impossible 2 is due here next month) and I must say I liked it pretty much.I was one of those folks who went to see this flick in the cinema, almost 4 years ago and I must say, I was pretty much disappointed. The Trailer had somehow made me believe that this was a high  speed action vehicle in the likes of a Die Hard with a bit of a Bond twist. This was not it. It was even more James Bond than James Bond, as referring to the spy stuff and that I did not like at all. I expected a sort of Goldeneye  like movie (as much action anyway and as much spy stuff). By the way, why is it Mission: Impossible and not Gadgets: Impossible? Or Events: Impossible? I mean this could be a Die Hard, Die Hard 4: Die Impossibly Hard. But I do not tend to rate movies on their believability, or why else would I love, Lethal Weapon 3, Die Hard 1+3, Goldeneye, The World is not Enough and so on.But hey that was 4 years ago, what did I think this time? Well, it was pretty good. There was a good story, which was at times a bit complicated, but you could follow and there were a few tense and exciting scenes. Yet there was not nearly as much action as in the Mission Impossible 2 Trailer. But that is not so bad after all.The actors all were OK, except one and I do not mean Cruise here, for I don't like him that much anyway. He is too much of a smoothie and he is much too slick for my feeling (please no hate-mail). The best one was VING RHAMES, yes him, he is a very talented actor and one who can always make me smile and laugh. He has got an incredible way of letting his face speak' in some way and he always seems to be a jolly and nice guy in this one. Yet he can be mean and dangerous (as in Con Air).Despite all that I was not excited all the time and on the edge of my seat. Sometimes there was too much talking and stuff involved and yet sometimes actors had funny lines, there was too much talking. Don't get me wrong, but I prefer Goldeneye to this one, you now with the standard Bond formula which includes: wits, action, exotic locations and very pretty female companions. This was: spy stuff, talk, plot and twists.Still 7 out of 10",7,2,3,18 June 2000
Saw," He came, he saw, he Wan
","Thriller fans can finally breathe again, or better hold their breath again; because once again there is a good no-nonsense thriller out there that stays away from Hollywood clichÃ©s and will chill you to the bone. Although the film is very original overall I'll among the first ones to admit that it sort of leans on a premise similar to that in Cube (in some ways). Now originality, for starters, are already two big thumbs up for this film, since it is unpredictable from beginning to end. Every once in a while you will catch yourself thinking: 'Now I get it...' and I bet you: You do NOT get it! But there is much more to this film than originality. What I especially liked about this film, was that it was shocking and disturbing, without being too graphical. You know, many films (especially horror and splatter films) are very graphic, but in being so they lose every chance at being gory or disturbing. A film like this though (or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)) is maintains a certain sense or realism and becomes truly disturbing because it avoids visual overkill. This cannot be accomplished though without the help of a good script, good actors and a capable filmmaker behind the camera and let me tell you Saw has it all. James Wan really put himself and fellow writer Leigh Whannell on the map with this one. There is not a single hole to be found in the entire story and the directing is good (although somewhat messy in some scenes with the head gear). I for one am excited to see Wans next picture (with Whanell contribution of course), although I'm not too keen on seeing Saw 2. To me it seems as pointless as a Texas Chainsaw Massacre II, but hey they even made American Psycho 2 and Cruel Intentions 3, so I guess there's no stopping the Hollywood machinery...nonetheless some things are better left alone! 8 out of 10post scriptum: I know it's hard to believe but I actually saw the Dutch premiere of this film",8,0,1,9 June 2005
The Hurricane," Good biopic!
","Although this started in a confusing way for me: is this another flashback story where someone reads the book and the whole thing is interrupted by the readers story? I found the answer very soon and I also found it was a good answer. For the answer is no, this is just how the story must be told. It is a heartwarming and heartbreaking story folks and it is well acted. I really loathe the fact that racism was and maybe even is so frequent in America and I must say this film could have also been told in a different way. Focused on the man, who had it bad too and who was according to this film, The Hurricane Carter's hero. John Artis. He had a bad life too and I'm therefore glad the film also focused on that.

Stalingrad," Good Germans in one of the worst battles of WW II
","This film used to be one of my favorites as a German teenager and re-watching it after 15 years was almost painful to some degree.The film now appears a reaction to stereotypical characterizations of Germans in US films, where they are all inherently evil. Unfortunately the film goes completely overboard with there being way too many good Germans. To make matters worse, the 'bad Germans' are mere caricatures, which seem to have been pulled straight out of Raiders of the Lost Ark.Such a shame to be so disappointed as I had been really looking forward to seeing this again. Admittedly this is a very juvenile attempt at history and depicting Germans a human rather than evil. As one German reviewer rightly concluded, the film does feel like it is playing down fascism and the Nazism.Down from 9 out of 10 to 6 out of 10 Definitely will not be buying the DVD after seeing it again.",6,1,1,14 January 2015
Reservoir Dogs," The Tarantino Pentathlon Part 2 - His debut: Reservoir Dogs
","This film draws ones attention
Reservoir Dogs is astonishing in so many ways, it is hard to find a beginning, which in this case are the actors. Every film, no matter how good the story, the directing or the effects rises and falls with the quality of actors and the degree to which they are believable. In this film, it is apparent, that all of the actors deliver great performances. There is really nothing else to be said about the acting, for one cannot go and analyze character depth in this film, for the characters as they are presented, are quite shallow. There is some information on some of the characters, but their characteristics as I might describe them here, would have to be based mostly on their actions and doing that would really screw up your viewing experience.
Another really great thing about this film, is it's story, which really is not that special at all when you look at it in retrospective. The story, is basically the typical robbery gone bad, but in this case, the way in which it is told (with a lot flashbacks) increases the excitement and produces not only great tension within the characters, but also within the viewer. Apart from that, the flashbacks also enable Tarantino to give this very thrilling film a lighter and funnier touch. So the flashbacks are really multidimensional here. They increase the tension, they relieve the tension and they provide the film with a lighter touch.
All of the aspects above are brilliantly captured by Tarantino's ingenious though simple usage of the camera. In keeping the movements limited and rather simple, he manages to keep the viewer close to the story and the events. By doing that, he succeeds in producing maximum thrill with a minimum of effects.
Considering the relatively low budget, the rather simple story and the minimum of effects, I think Reservoir Dogs is a really amazing product and I am not the only one. A lot of people seemed (and still seem) to agree with me on that one. Not only did Tarantino receive a lot of hail for this work, but he also managed to get many more of his idea's realized on film. The climax of Tarantino's career (which is not over yet, mind you) would come in 1994 with Pulp Fiction, which he co-wrote, directed and starred in. After that Tarantino's work (as far as writing and directing is concerned) became of less quality. First he would make a segment for the film Four Rooms and after that he would star in and partially write the still good genre classic From Dusk till Dawn. Following those films, he made Curdled (writing only) and later Jackie Brown, which was his last directorial offering. That film became something of a disappointment, for it did not have the typical Tarantino style and I ask all of you: How could it have if Tarantino had neither written the original story nor starred in it?' One can conclude that, although on average Tarantino's work is of good quality, his films following Pulp Fiction have been of lesser quality than his work before that very same film and one can only hope, Tarantino will manage to shine again with his next project, called Kill Bill. I, for one, am very excited about that film, because the title is catchy, the actors have potential and it is written and directed by the master himself: Quentin Tarantino. I must add though, that I am excited DESPITE. I am excited about Kill Bill despite the fact that Quentin does not have an acting part the film and I am excited despite the fact that I thought the trailer did not look very promising.

Detroit Rock City," Eddie chooses wisely yet again
","I am what you could consider an Edward Furlong fan, since I rent or tape any film of his I come across. This does not mean though that I'm a die hard fan with articles and posters and stuff. I just think that he's a pretty good actor who chooses his projects wisely. He certainly did so in choosing this film, for Detroit Rock City has a lot of quality. It is funny, it has good rock tunes and the story also holds a few surprises. This is not to say that everything is good here. Sometimes the film is a little bit over the top and I did not like the ending very much (too predictable contrary to the rest of the film), which was somewhat of a bummer for me. The rest is good though if you can appreciate rock music (hear out for some REAL rock classics) or if or if you enjoy Jay and Silent Bob films, for this comes very close to being one. There might not be as much sex talk as in a Jay and Silent Bob film, but experience-wise it sure comes in the vicinity of those films. Imagine a mixture Mallrats and That 70's Show and you've got DETROIT ROCK CITY.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Magical at (almost) every level
","First of all I feel obligated to tell all of you, that I'd never read a book or even heard something of Harry Potter, before I went to see this film. All I knew was, that he is a wizard who goes to a wizard school and has adventures there. I picked that much up from the hype that has become Harry Potter since the first book was published.
On to the movie. I must say that despite the many followers of the Harry Potter hype, including the millions that have read the book or seen the film, I kept sceptical about whether I'd like this film. I mean I am almost 21 years old, so maybe it would be too childish for me, who knows? But it was not. It was just as childish as I like it. Christopher Columbus has really outdone himself here. I mean he's made a couple of good films, but this comeback (after the pretty solid Stepmom and the box  office loser Bicentennial Man) really makes this effort stand out so much more.
It is however not only Chris Columbus' quality that made this film what it is. Much of the praise has to go to the writer Mrs. Rowling and to the actors and actresses. I could go on and on about the fact that every actor was good, but what really was astonishing in my mind is, that all children actors and actresses were so good. I mean they were GREAT. They are in my mind even better than the grown ups, because this movie is about the kids, not the adults. The four main wannabe' wizards, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ronald Weasley and Draco Malfoy (who does not only have a name that reminds one of Count Dracula, but looks like a version of him as well), all give you the feeling that many things are yet to come and that many things will happen between them. I mean I am no psychic, but I'd say that someday that little count Dracula will become Harry Potter's opponent and that maybe one day (if they get old enough in the stories) Mrs. Granger and Mr. Potter might become more than friends although I'm not sure of that. Maybe I've just seen the Star Wars films too often. If I have, it does not matter anyway, for the cast and crew of this film have watched them too often as well. One part of the music clearly is like Star Wars, there is a hat with a Yoda  like speech pattern plus the teachers want to keep Harry Potter away from the dark side of the force, oh sorry MAGIC!' Come on!!! They've seen Star Wars and learned from it! Not that it bothers me, on the contrary! I am quite pleased to see that people are able to see and pick out something good and insert it into their own work either as an homage or simply because it appeals to them.
There were few things bad in this film. Actually it was only one thing. SPECIAL EFFECTS. Where the heck did Warner Bros. get those guys? I mean one time they create world class effects and then the next you can easily spot the blue screen from miles! It was not as bad that it ruined my experience of the film, but be honest, in a film of this magnitude, you can expect good Effects throughout (see The Lord of The Rings: The fellowship of the Ring or Artificial Intelligence). The effects really were a let down for me at times, but maybe they just overdid it. There were times, in my opinion, that a blue screen would not have even been necessary. Those were also some of the times you could tell the landscape was projected onto a blue screen. Better luck next time.
After the huge success of this film (and even if the success had been more moderate) there will be a number of sequels. Actually two more films are already planned (set for release in 2002 and 2004) and it is believed, that if Mrs. Rowling writes all seven books (as she intended to do), there will be seven films made in total. There are a few things I would like to say to Warner Bros. in regard to those films. First of all, make sure that you will have all original actors necessary for the sequels under contract and if not so persuade them with lots of money. Do not, I repeat DO NOT hire other actors to play characters already portrayed by someone else. Second, hold on to your screenwriter. He has been successful so far in doing what he does. Third, hold on to the man that composed the music. In a franchise you want to keep the music the same throughout all films. If possible even to make the music so memorable, that it makes people say: That the music from Harry Potter.' Fourth and last, hold on to your director (at least for the next one or two sequels, preferably for all if he is up to it).  He has worked with all those kids before and knows how to talk to them and how to make them perform well. Plus this is not some Mission: Impossible or James Bond like franchise in which you want every movie to stand on his own. It is supposed to be more of an Indiana Jones kind of franchise. If you do, however change your director, may I suggest that you do is as George Lucas did with the original Star Wars trilogy. Get basically unknown directors, who know their way around a studio and get them to make the film, how you want it to be done. Approaching a director switch like that, will allow all films to fit into the big picture, without inconsistent film styles ruining it.
A good film for the whole family, but just as The Lord of the Rings: The fellowship of the Ring, it falls short to be best film of the year.8,25 out of 10",8,0,0,28 January 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," Reloaded and rehearsed; my request: bring on the Revolution
","This film has been in the spotlight for quite some time now and so has it's follow-up The Matrix Revolution (which is due out in November sometime). The reason for that is quite simple, namely that these films are the follow-ups to one of the most refreshing, visually innovative and exciting films of the last 5 years: THE MATRIX. Now a lot has happened since The Matrix was released in 1999 and I can assure you that you won't awe like you've awed when you saw The Matrix for the first time, but I'll assure you, you'll be impressed.
Now there is not much of a story here, in that I agree with some other people that have posted comments before me, but instead of some people that did I say: there was enough. While watching the film, I felt that everything that was explained to me concerning the story was pretty much logical, given the events in the original movie. That means that you need to have seen the original to comprehend this film even remotely. This is not some Bad Boys II or Lara Croft II: The Cradle Of Life like film you can just tune into without knowing the full history. It is complicated and at times it is barely comprehensible for those of us who have watched The Matrix. With this I'm referring to some conversation near the end of the film, which were so filled with information that I'll be in need to watch it a couple of times more and rest assured, it won't be something I mind.
Regarding the film itself, I found that there is very little to say without spoiling the experience but I'll try and give as my positive as well as my negative criticism in a constructive way, so I do not offend anybody in the slightest way. First of all, I have to congratulate the Wachowski brothers (Andy and Larry for you that do not know) on making this film as visually stunning as the first, without repeating themselves and with adding still new tricks that blew me away and not only that, almost throughout the film the effects were amazingly incredible. There is however one small negative critique I have to give here, for in the fighting sequence on the truck between Morpheus and one of the Agents I was a bit disappointed by the effects. Now I am not sure whether they were out of money of whether this kind of technique isn't available yet, but I felt that for a short moment that sequence wasn't as sophisticated and shiny as the rest of the film. Apart from that I was very satisfied with the action, which (this is no critique) could have included a bit more shooting in my opinion. But enough on the negative comments, what about those white rasta (or was is dreadlock) twins? THEY WERE AWESOME!!! Mentioning them I have to say something about the new add-ons in to The Matrix Reloaded. There is (of course) Jada Pinkett Smith also Monica Bellucci, which are both extremely beautiful actresses, but apart from that I must say that they along with all other new additions (whom I will not mention by name) did a wonderful job in this film. The reason why I am only naming these two actresses is because I can feel in my gut that one of them (Pinkett) will have a crucial role in The Matrix Revisited and I'm mentioning Bellucci, because I thought her appearance was rather odd. I am not referring her appearance in general, but rather to the bathroom scene with Keanu Reeves she appeared in. That scene struck me as rather odd while I was watching it, although it did not disturb me. The thing is probably, that I am wondering if there is anything more behind it than they showed. Speaking of scenes in the film I do not understand brings me to the party / togetherness scene which I thought was overly (though not yet awkwardly) long. I admit that at the end I was able to grab the essence that persuaded the Wachowski brothers to insert it into the film, but I was nonetheless able to understand why they made that scene so long.
Because I do not want to bore you with detailed description of all the cool action sequences and because I do not want to spoil you're viewing experience I think it is time for me to tell you what you should expect of this film (I have to underscore again that you probably won't like this film much or even understand it if you haven't seen The Matrix). The thing with the Matrix Reloaded is, that it builds forth on the story from The Matrix and that it therefore can neither be required to have much of a story (look at other trilogy's and figure out what their midsection's story is) nor that it needs one. The thing is there is probably a red line that connects all three films (at least there is a line that connects The Matrix and Reloaded) and that it therefore cannot be divided into parts that have a story. Rather these films have to be viewed as a whole. What can you expect of Reloaded then? Well, a lot of cool action in sometimes very impressive and cool sequences, heart, emotion and foremost you can expect a good time. Is it better than the first you ask and I reply NO. Is it a good sequel you ask and I say YES.
Be sure that I'll revisit for the REVOLUTION, nay be certain

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Harry Potter and his investigative wizards
","First of all I want to start by saying that I (as a non Rowling reader), do not understand all the commotion about Daniel Radcliffe's (Harry Potter) growing up, which is accompanied with looking older and a breaking voice. What the heck wrong with that? All the other wizards in the film seem to grow older just as ordinary people, so why shouldn't Harry? I for one, don't care if he grows older, because every Harry Potter installment (as far as I know), starts one year later than it's predecessor and I think it is only natural then for Harry (and of course Daniel Radcliffe) to grow up and become more mature. I mean, if it already bothers some people now, I wonder what they'll say in 2004 when The Prisoner of Azkaban will be made! Anyway, I do not mind and that is what counts while I am watching the film.
Right from the start I felt very at ease with this film, because even for me (a non reader) the film contained a number of people, things and animals that I recalled from The Sorcerer's Stone, for instance the mail owls or Harry's very annoying and rude family'. This feeling of familiarity increased, reaching it's climax when Harry returned to Hogwarts and was reunited with his friends. Because everything seemed so familiar, it was almost as if I myself was returning to Hogwarts. The story of the film is quite good, as was the first story, though there were some scenes that were predictable, like the one in which the ceiling of the cave comes down. Also there were some scenes in which I was just a bit ahead of the main characters considering the necessary steps to solve the mystery. Amazingly I did not find my knowledge of things to come annoying, for I realized it was done that way for a reason. Despite those few scenes and events that were predictable, there were also a number of good scenes that truly amazed and astonished me. The unpredictability along with the complex story, which will keep you guessing until the final revelation, shows how inventive Mrs. Rowling's writing is and it once again proves Harry Potter books are not for children only, for even I (21 years old) was not able to see through the story. It was that well constructed! While I'm on the story anyway, I want to say that, although it is obvious that there is a Harry Potter formula (each story covers about a year at Hogwarts; the stories (at least the first two) involve mysteries, which Harry, Ron and Hermione have to solve in a detective sort of way), the first two films have been made in an extremely original way. One thing that I found really strange' about this film, was how I actually came to like Ron Weasley more than Harry Potter. There was much more attention to Ron as a character than there was in The Sorcerer's Stone and Rupert Grint managed to be very funny and likeable as Ron this time. Despite the fact that my increased liking for Ron is strange strange', because Harry Potter is the main character, I think it was a pretty good idea to give Ron more attention. I mean, in order to enjoy all Harry Potter films, one has to be able to identify with all main characters (the three good ones I mean). I therefore think it would be wise, if in an upcoming installment, there would be some extra attention payed to Hermione. Actually I do not need to tell that to Mrs.Rowling, the film-makers or anyone for that matter, because I know (and I think you do too) there will be a more special' relationship between Hermione and Harry, in which course she will get more attention.
Commenting on this film, I cannot refrain from comparing it with The Sorcerer's Stone and the things that were better or worse, although there are actually but one items in each category. The thing I liked less in this film, was that it was not as emotional and epic' as the first film, dealing with the legend of Harry Potter and the way in which it came to life. The special effects though, were better in this film. The production company had made so much profit with The Sorcerer's Stone that they could afford to put a bit more money into this film and I must say that it really showed.
In the end I would like to say that I am very sorry to have heard that Richard Harris (Albus Dumbledore) has passed away. He was a good actor and he certainly did his job in well in the first two Harry Potter installments. I know that the people of the production company are now seeking a new Dumbledore and I hope for them and us (the viewers) that they find a replacement that is as adequate as Richard Harris himself. Furthermore I would like to ask the production company and all involved in the making of the Harry Potter films, to refrain from making new ones, if Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson or Rupert Grint should decide to stop after three installments. Personally I think, that after making three Potter films you either have the stigma of being Harry, Ron or Hermione or you will never get it. So I see no reason for Daniel, Rupert or Emma to stop, but they just might think otherwise. If they do, I urge the producers, not to replace them, but to stop making Harry Potter films, for replacing the key actors wouldn't be fair to the millions of  children who love Harry (not to mention the adults).

All Quiet on the Western Front," Great story, pretty good film
","Before seeing this film I had already read the book All Quiet on the Western Front (in German) by Erich-Maria Remarque and seen the 1979 TV movie All quiet on the Western Front. Being a great fan of the book and having been told by my German teacher in high school that this was a great film, I decided to give it a try. I must say that I was very impressed by the special effects and the great care of the director and the crew in capturing the spirit of the war and depicting the surroundings as realistic as was possible. They did a really great job in making the film believable and I must confess that I've seen more modern films than this, with worse effects and care taken to make it look realistic. Overall the film was well made (obviously leaving out many gruesome scenes from the book) but I felt that the scenes in which Lew Ayres (Paul Bäumer) tried to be reflective / moralistic or sorrowful were quite cheesy (in an old-fashioned Hollywood kind of way). I mean the guy did a good job in appearing frantic and cheerful, but being filled with sorrow or trying to be reflective on what he did just didn't fit him at all. Also I felt that Marion Clayton (Paul's sister in the film) did a pretty bad job in the few scenes she had. In addition to that, I thought it was a pity that the film didn't end exactly the way the book did. I mean the ending of the film is quite powerful, but the ending words of the book are so much stronger and much more powerful. Of course I read the book in German and considered from that point of view I could have imagined / would have liked to see the ending lines of the book scrolled onto the screen, as the picture slowly faded away.All Quiet on the Western Front (rated from low to high):1979 Verison: 7 out of 10 1930 Version: 7 out of 10 (because of the better ending and the overall bigger / better effort this one ranks higher than the 1979 TV version) Book Version: 9,5 out of 10post scriptum: I'd like to see a German film version of the book, staying true to the book (especially to it's gruesomeness and it's ending) since I think a totally German version will be much more powerful to begin with",7,0,6,16 December 2004
Scream 2," A Classic's sequel
","Well this in a way is a typical sequel and in a way it is not. You have all the original cast here which is I must say a must in a sequel. You really shouldn't do that kind of stuff they did in for instance Chucky or so, keep the cast if the names are the same, all else is bull and most of the audience won't like it. Also don't change a good formula!!!! (this goes out to them suckers who want to make Scream 4 without the original cast (or even dare to think about it)). If you want to do it do it with them or NOT and if you do, please Neve, Courteney, David and Wes only when the script is great, no ONLY when it RULES and do not do it for money when your career is in a dip like van Damme did with Universal Sodier 2. I mean look at lousy horror sequels: Hellraiser 2 and 4, Chucky 3, Nightmare on Elm Street 5 and A new Nightmare (sorry Wes).This is I must admit not the second time I watched this one, for I was preparing to see Scream 3 really soon afterwards, so I wanted to see Scream 1 and Scream 2 before, so I could get back in to everything that happened. I already knew, of course, who the killer was and this review (as to the whodunnit) looks at the film as if I first saw it.Another good thing here is that all the cast looks grown up, I mean between Scream and Scream 2 there is only one year, but you feel as if many years have gone by (just as the story suggests). This is especially extreme with Neve Campbell, who in Scream looked like 15 or 16 and here looks like 19 or so. I must also say, that the new looks of Campbell and Courteney Cox are much better (they look good, with those clothes and different hair, yummy!!!!). There are yet some other pretty ladies running about, what about that Sarah Michelle Gellar and Sid's on screen friend played by Elise Neil. Of course you can see also Portia DeRossi also, who is if I may say is pretty too (normally), but here is just a non - ugly (along with all her sorority sisters) female. I must say though she plays one genuine bleached blonde bim.. (you fill out the rest) here. Also there was of course the shagadelic Heather Graham, who played in the movie Stab' but who had a real bad wig there in the movie within the movie. But she was not as pretty either here.This one may be not as original as the first one, but it still is funny, exciting, surprising (you never know who is/are the killer(s)) and well acted. For the psycho killer(s) I must say he/she/they was/were great, you really believed he/she /they were totally flipped and you bought it. Neve Campbell really has grown in acting and is yet much more believable and so are David Arquette and Courteney Cox, whose characters are deepened out.NOW I want to spend a few lines on the great Neve Campbell, I thought she will be great (as in a successful actress) when I saw The Craft, Scream, Scream 2, but I must revise this now, she chooses to stay and make low budget films, that are not so heavily supported by the studios and so tend to make little money. But I must say that it is a good choice as long as the movies are as good as Wild Things or Simba's Pride.The best thing here though is the direction, Wes Craven made this one much more theatrical than the first one, and there are two scenes I LUV especially, the opening scene and the rehearsal scene. They are great and combine effects, music and events perfectly. Also there are some great spoofs. Now I bet you wonder why this does not get a 10, I presume, well I felt that some things should not have been done in the film, like that scene when Cox and Arquette go see some footage. Also I didn't like the new camera dude that much, played by Duane Martin, for I thought his frightened' character was too overdone. Also I found the ending not very good, it was mere average. The end of Scream was much and much better, so it come that this film does not get a 10.Still: rent, watch and enjoy8 out of 10",7,4,7,18 June 2000
Bram Stoker's Dracula," One of the most romantic stories ever told
","The background of this story is the myth / legend of Count Vlad Dracula (son of count Dracul) nicknamed' Vlad Tepes (Vlad the impaler). Vlad was, as the film tells us a warlord in the 15th century who fought the Turks. According to the myth he drank the blood of his victims and impaled them. This is a real myth, as it was and maybe even is still believed in Rumania. A lot of information about Vlad Dracula was later gathered by Irish writer Bram Stoker, who, combined it with myths of vampires into this tale of the well known blood -sucking Vampire. Another thing that is real in this film are the pictures in the book Vampyr, which is read by van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) in this movie. The pictures you find there are also to be found in history and school books, complete with ancient writings beside them.
I will not reveal to you the nature of the plot, but I must say this bloody horror film is one of the most sad and romantic stories ever told. It is about a man who loses his wife and cannot rejoin her in another life. So he turns against anything people in the 15th century believed in and is punished by god to wander the earth as the undead. He is cursed to be feared and hunted, for he needs to drink the blood of man to keep alive. He is nosferatu (vamyr), he is Count Dracula.
He lives miserably for about 400 years until he falls in love again. And by doing so we are dragged into the fortune and misery of a creature who lives eternally. He is alive, but lifeless on the inside. He is rich, gentle and loving, yet he must feast on humans to survive. He is damned forever, whilst he did not do anything wrong.
The settings of this great story is late 19th century Europe (England and Karpathia). Karpathia is not well known to man, the wild side of Europe. All this bears with it the mysticism of this story and the epic and tragic background. As for Dracula (Gary Oldman) himself, he drags us into a world of blood, lust and erotica. He seems only to be driven by his great love for Mina (Winona Ryder) and the need of being together with her. TRUE LOVE
There are some great (and famous) actors in this film: Anthony Hopkins, Winona Ryder, Gary Oldman, Cary Elwes and Keanu Reeves. They all contribute greatly to this film, although I must say that the best acting comes from Gary Oldman (Dracula), Sadie Frost (Lucy), Sir Anthony Hopkins (van Helsing) and music legend Tom Waits (Renfield). Do not get me wrong the rest is good to and do their job's well, but these four really put the dot on the i.
Besides the actors there are a lot of things that stand out (look at the list of prizes and nominations at the Oscars), but I must say two people are left unaccounted for there. The director Francis Ford Copolla and the genius behind the haunting and touching music Wojciech Kilar. They both bring so much to the greatness of this film, I would have felt like an idiot if I had left them out.
This does not  only make an excellent horror / epic / romantic film, but surely is (in my opinion) a great date flick, about love everlasting and the tragedy of a man who is cursed to live forever and roam the world alone, for he is feared and hunted.

Die Hard with a Vengeance," Die Deutschen sind wieder los! And there just as mean and twice as ugly!
","This film stays true to Hollywood's favourite villains, the GERMANS, there are no people who are so often cast as villains (I wonder why) and only the Russians get close. But they tend to do a good job, so why not use them. Or as they did here, hire an American or Englishman (just as they did in the 1st one) and let him pretend to be a German. OK his German isn't that good (his brother Hans' was a tag worse so here is an improvement). But at least some of the henchmen are real German's so there is a bit of good German spoken in the film.
I found it really great that the original cast / crew was assembled here Bruce Willis of course and also John McTiernan, who is a great director. The cast was greatly enriched with the great Samuel L.Jackson (who is one of the best and most successful supporting actors of OUR time). The bad guy was good too, you know, playing games, making riddles and riddles hard to solve when the clock is ticking and he wasn't too stupid either, he would have succeeded if he hadn't made one little mistake in the end, but hey, how should he know McClane would escape. It was really impossible from the villains point of view!!! 
But to cut the yip yap on to the film, it is great, it has got some great action sequences, great acting (for an action flick), good direction and of course enough profanity and dumb comments to make you laugh you fu..ing a.. off. I mean I've seen it 6 or 7 times since 1997 (that's 7 TIMES in THREE YEARS) and I still love it, the only pity is that it is cut to 123 minutes (I need to see the uncut version!!!!) and there was quite a lot of cutting in the version I saw. It appeared to me that there were cut's during the cutting up the guard scene (not sure about that one though), the elevator scene, during the falling on the boat and disposing scene and last, but not least in the fight with Targo scene. 
Now for a bit of SPOILER stuff I guess about solving the 3 and 5 gallon bottle mystery (hell I just figured it out during the 7th time I saw this one. Ain't I STUPID???). Well this is for the folks that don't get it either:
You fill the 5 gallon totally up, then you put 3 of those 5 gallons in the 3 gallon bottle. After that you empty the 3 gallon bottle and our the 2 gallon from the 5 gallon bottle in the three gallon bottle (STATUS: 5 gallon bottle = 0 gallons and 3 gallon bottle = 2 gallons). After that you fill the 5 gallon bottle up and then you fill the missing gallon in the 3 gallon bottle with the water from the filled up 5 gallon bottle. That leaves you exactly 4 gallon in the 5 gallon bottle!!!

The Green Mile," Good follow up to Shawshank
","This film is really good, despite it's length of about three hours and despite the fact that it is somehow unbelievable, for at the film's center there is a inmate, John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) who has supernatural powers. This is actually the basic of the story and one of the things why that Coffey is so memorable to Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks). But there is something else, for that Coffey character has got a character quite opposing his looks and this is something that was really memorable about him as well.
In this film there are so many good things that I'm afraid I will either forget too many things or that I will write about 3000 words (which is not allowed), so I'll try and keep it short. The actors are all great, from Hanks, to Duncan and Doug Hutchinson (who plays the perfect a..hole). The direction, the music, the script. EVERYTHING is good. OK I must admit, that I thought I'd see a different kind of movie (I didn't know about the supernatural stuff and I must say it is quite SUPERnatural (but who cares)). I sort of expected the same rationally explicable stuff as in the Shawshank Redemption. DAMN was I wrong. After you get used to the supernatural stuff though you get sucked into the story and the three hours feel like much much much less. One thing that helps the movie too, being entertaining, is that in the meantime there is enough other stuff going on and some good one - liners jokes are tossed around. My favorite part of the movie is of course the end of the narrative part of the film, for here no eye will be left dry and you will probably all have tears in your eyes, or even shed a few (like I did). I know my eyes were wet and my throat hurt like hell at the end. This is just one entertaining, funny, moving and original movie which is just as good as Darabont's Shawshank Redemption. GREAT JOB Y'ALL. GO SEE THIS FILM.

Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," An animation classic
","I admit that this film has a couple of flaws. The music is not too good and (of course) the animation is not too good. But you have to see it all in perspective. This film was made about 65 years ago and I think it is a great accomplishment that the film can entertain people (including me) even now. I mean I'd rather watch this film (which is not perfect technically regarding today's standards) than watch Godzilla, The Avengers or Mission to Mars again. I honestly must say that the theme of the film has an approach that is well kind early 20th century but hey that's when it was made and although I didn't like that aspect very much I still enjoyed this film more than I did 2001's Artificial Intelligence (just to name one). The execution of the theme might be a bit old as may the animation techniques, but the good thing is that great humoristic scenes never lose their effect. My favorite dwarf? That's easy DOPEY. I mean the face he has and the stunts he pulls easily make him the funniest dwarf in my opinion and the one that deserves most of the grade I give this film.7 out of 10",7,3,7,17 November 2001
The Lion King," The King of the jungle and certainly one of Disney's crown jewels
","The Lion King is a truly amazing product of animated film-making. The characters and the surroundings are as beautifully drawn as ever, the voices have been well chosen and the music is good, but apart from all that, there is something special about this film. You are probably wondering what I am talking about, well I'm talking about the story and the way in which it was brought to the screen. The story, although being some sort of the typical good versus evil story is great. There is some real character depth and emotion in the story and it is brought to the screen in such a wonderful way, that I (21 years of age) actually shed a tear or two. Since I do not shed tears easily watching a film, I found it even more astonishing, that this animated feature succeeded in making me do so. The Lion King is not the kind of animated film that will make you burst out in laughter a lot, but rather an enchanting and moving story of love, loss and betrayal. If you want to laugh your heart out, you really ought to search for another film, but if you want to see a film that will touch and move you, go and see The Lion King. You'll enjoy it and even if you don't, I know I did.

","amongst so many films that are really well known and stink and blockbusters that stink. This is not a blockbuster but a classic to all movie buffs and it is becoming more and more known and appreciated. I love this film. I have seen it the for the third time recently and still it brings tears into my eyes at some points. The cast is great, with Morgan Freeman and a great Tim Robbins. I still do not know what to think of Andy (Robbins), did he do it or didn't he. There are several hints in the film but I still do not know, for Andy is a hard man to see through.

Scream," A slasher / thriller classic
","This is truly a classic slasher / thriller movie, for it is truly scary, has a good plot, great actors, a lot of blood, celebrity cameos (very rare for the first film of a series, which says something about the film already), a good soundtrack, great direction and it is funny. Though I still do think Scream 2 is better, this is good too, even though this is the second time I watched this one. I had to, but soon I'd be seeing part 3 and I wanted to be all back in the history of Scream. The killer still is frightening, although I knew who it was. I knew it also the first time I watched it, a minute or so before it was revealed, well kind of anyway. But still, the ending is just great. If there would be persons to thank here for doing a great job, it would be all of them, what a great ensemble, man, but special thanks to the casting, for picking these eye  feasts, Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, Drew Barrymore and the well figured Rose McGowan, who was really sexy here.Other good things in this film were, that the comedy wasn't focused on only one person, but they were all funny in a way and that they were not all just people, but they were characters, which is really rare in a slasher film.7, 5 (so that'll be an 8 here) out of 10",8,0,0,18 June 2000
Blow," Bad people are all around
","This is the story of a man, that was bad in an illegal way, but who was surrounded by people who were worse (though in a legal way). How can a guy have so much bad luck and be surrounded by such an amount of complete a..holes. I mean, JUDAS PRIEST. How can one??? I really felt for the poor guy. He was f..ked by everyone that was important or close to him (except his dad) in his life and he's still doing time in prison. I do not think that what he did was right, but he sure as hell was unlucky. Plus, he got a real harsh punishment, serving what, 20 or 25 years until his release in 2015??? Good film though.

Vanilla Sky," Pretty good film, that could have been great
","This film could have been a masterpiece in my (humble) opinion, if it had ended with the elevator doors opening at the top of the skyscraper. But it did not end there and it became too long, because the moral of the film had already been named and the mystery had been solved. Good acting by Cruise and Cruz. I generally do not like Cruise that much (too much smiley, happy, slick guy) but he was good here. My absolute hero in this film: Jason Lee. HE RULES. Whenever I see him I must laugh. HE IS SO COOL. I guess I always have to think about the Brody character (Mallrats) when I see him.

Any Given Sunday," Pretty much liked it
","I am nor an American nor a die hard American Football fan, but still I thought this was a pretty good movie. That said I must say that I think you must know a bit about football to actually get all the stuff on the field. You know, you don't need to be an expert, but things as line of scrimmage, 1st down, punt, 2nd down, 3rd down, 4th down and stuff you should know. The acting in this film definitely was ok (good choice in cheerleaders and celebrity - sluts Mr. Stone. They looked very good). The best scene I thought was when Al Pacino gave the speech for the Play off game. That was really the best scene.SPOILERS!!!Another scene I liked though was when Willie and other guys were in the locker room and some big white guy played a record of his loud as hell. It was Metallica's Motorbreath. Willie goes on up to him and says like: 'Turn of that nazi rock s**t.' And the guy is all like: 'Man this is Metallica. James Hetfield is GOD.' I thought that was so cool and one of the funniest moments for me (as being a huge Metallica fan meself).SPOLERS END!!!But there were other good lines and jokes too. Pretty enjoyable for a guy who watches `THE GAME' sometimes. But if you love the game, breathe the game and sleep the game you WILL love this move.7 out of 10",7,0,0,24 February 2001
The Emperor's New Groove," Worst animated Disney feature since A bug's Life
","I was strangely enough not too impressed by Disney's hit A Bug's Life and I must honestly say I preferred watching AntZ by DreamWorks. With this film Disney has his new rock bottom' for me, after such great animated flicks as Tarzan, Toy Story 2 and Dinosaur. Of course I do not mean rock bottom in a Mission of Mars kind of way. I just mean to say that this film shows that there are certain Disney movies that seem to be inferior to the rest. Like A Bug's Life, this is one of the few animated theatrical releases by Disney in the years since Aladdin, that doesn't breathe fun and excitement. I think that is mainly, because one has to try very hard liking the main character and because the story is not too good (emotion, action, comedy or romantic wise) as were all the other Disney animated features. I mean Hercules was not as epic as I wished but Pain & Panic surely made up for that, but in this film I just missed that kind of characters. This does not mean though, that The Emperor's New Groove stunk. It was just not Disney GOOD.

Blade Runner," Well a classic it might be but good??? (Review for the director's cut)
","Not in my opinion, Ridley Scott has done better, Alien, Thelma & Louise, G.I. Jane and of course Gladiator. But this film isn't bad I must say. The acting is OK, Rutger Hauer is GOOD, the direction and special effects are good too. You know it just isn't a high speed out of control vehicle film and it doesn't move me that much. When I saw it first a few years back, I'd given it a 4, but after playing the game to death and loving it and seeing the film again I must give it a 6. See it and maybe you'll love it if you remember this is a flick based on story and not on nonstop action you will have to like it a bit. Definately NO waste of time.
Post scriptum: How the hell did Scott make the effects look so bloody good???????????????????

Casino Royale," The name is Blunt, James Blunt: The birth of James Bond
","There is a lot that can be said about Daniel Cgraig and I must admit that I've said a couple of negative things about him as well. I think he looks more like a prizefighter than the stylish, sophisticated lady-killer that James Bond is supposed to be. Also he is blonde and what's with the haircut anyway.Leaving all my prejudices behind, I decided to step into the theater anyway las Sunday with a couple of my best friends. In the end none of us were disappointed, including the two women accompanying us. THe thought that was going through my brain as I left the theater was: finally another good Bond film after 11 years of draught! Now do not get me wrong, I liked Brosnan as Bond, but Tomorrow Never Dies and Die another Day were simply effect laden Bond vehicles that tried to top every other movie by exploding as much stuff as possible. The World is not Enough came close enough to being a good Bond, but a crappy male villain and Denise Richards spoiled it all. What a waste of Sophie Marceau was that! Luckily Bond producers remembered a man named Campbell. Someone who had done Bond before and had used a 'new kid' before. And I must admit, that as Campbell did with Goldeneye, he pulled off Casino Royale. The funny thing is, that almost all of the criticism I mentioned earlier add to making the film great. Since this is not just another Bond film; This is the birth of Bond and that is what makes it great. After seeing this film, you won't take for granted who Bond is, you'll understand him. You'll know why he drinks what he drinks. You'll understand that he is not someone who uses women just for pleasure, but that deep within there lies a secret. Because of these things the film does not feel like a real Bond film and some might see that as a bad thing. But because of this film, the character also get's so much more depth I can only see it as a good thing.Apart from that there is enough action and sensuality to make the film interesting, so I can recommend it even if you're not a Bondiac. But beware if you've seen other Bond films, because this one is more brutal than the others and much more gritty when it comes to scenes of violence and death! Well done Craig, Campbell & Co.8 out of 10",8,0,1,28 November 2006
Live Free or Die Hard," They've done it all now
","Giving Die Hard 4.0 a 7 is flattering it. I think it only deserves a 6,5 and I think the current 7,7 average is well too flattering. THe reason for this is that the action sequences try and top everything McCLane ever had to endure in the other Die Hard movies. They do succeed in doing this, but bigger is not always better. Sometimes Willis, Wiseman and Co. just try too hard to include bigger bangs and it makes some of the scenes seem ridiculous.I think this is a letdown from other Die Hard movies and Willis seems nothing more than a tired hero. He does also seem more human though, which is something I enjoyed. A few scenes were quite touching and I must admit, that in that perspective Die Hard 4.0 made a good impression. Nonetheless I feel the need to be honest and I'll have to say that I feel it is time John McClane should retire. He Deserves it.6,5 out of 10",7,0,1,4 January 2008
X2: X-Men United," They've listened to my plea and made a sequel
","X2 (what people invent such a clever title?) was released here in the Netherlands on May the 1st, but I had to wait until today (May 25th) before I could finally watch it, because as a poor student I was a little short of cash (plus I'd planned to waste my last few bucks on seeing The Matrix Reloaded on the REALLY big screen and watch X2 in the village cinema which gets movies a few weeks weeks to three months later than any other cinema). Anyway I was pretty excited to see it and when it came to my notice that the film would be playing th the village cinema on the 25 of May (a mere 3 weeks after it's release) I immediately reserved me some tickets. A few hours before going to the theater though I came to realize that I hadn't seen a preview of X2 yet. No trailer, no teaser, nothing (or had I simply forgot about it due to the Matrix hype?). The only thing I new was that the mutants had to stand united for something. Now why was I going to watch a film, if I didn't know what it was about? Well I was going, because I had seen the first X - Men film, which in my mind (I don't know if that is a good method to measure by) was awesome. To make it even more plain and simple: I was going because this film roughly had the same cast and crew as the first X - Men film and because I trusted them to make a good sequel. I didn't need noisy trailers or samples of the special effects and action scenes that were to be seen in the film. Being responsible for making X - Men (with Spider-Man THE BEST Marvel comic adaption until now) is all the credit you need to get me to the big screen.
X2 kicks off with a very nice fighting, scene which certainly owed some of it's visual finesse to Andy and Larry (you know who you are and so do most movie buffs). After that shine and turbulent intro the film continues where X - Men had ended, namely with Wolverine's quest to find out what exactly had happened to him. From that point on, these two events become entangled into each other and a story unfolds which builds on quite well on the previous film, without neglecting new elements. The new elements in the story are mainly new characters or characters that get a bit more attention than in X - Men (Pyro, Nightcrawler, Colossus) who were all portrayed in an acceptable manner by the actors. The only exception to that was Nightcrawler, who was portrayed excellently by Alan Cumming. He was very believable and rather sweet as the faithful and shy mutant from Germany and he even managed to nail the parts in the film in which he spoke German (correct German without too much of an accent and none of that: 'Schiess den Glas' crap they pulled in Die Hard). The rest of the film pretty much built forth on the things that were established in the first film (so if you haven't seen it I can advise you too, it will make some things much clearer). The film does so in an excellent manner and I've really got no complaints to the film overall. The action and the story were good, there were some emotional elements and one or two laughs as well, without any big misstep's. But comparing the film to it's predecessor (something which one always does) I must say that the film could have been a bit more dramatic. Not just to add drama, but to give the film more depth. Yes that is the word. The film could have had a bit more depth. It could for instance have explored the relationship between Jason and Charles Xavier a bit more or there could have been a bit more focus on what Stryker had done to Jason, so we (the viewers) could have felt a bit more for that pitiful 'creature'. Now mind you that these are all minor pointers to the makers and it does not mean that the film was not good. It just means that it wasn't as good as the first one, it wasn't perfect. But is still was a very good sequel. I (yes I too answer the question that has held a lot of movie freaks in their grip for quite some time this year) even thought it was better than The Matrix Reloaded. But that does not mean much, simply because The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions are to be combined into a 5 hour long film and I've only seen half of it. I am as it were currently in the lobby of the cinema drinking and eating some refreshments, waiting for the break to finish.
Singer, cast and crew have once again managed to make a good film and I am truly grateful for it. I sure as hell hope that they'll make a third film in the series and I hope that next time they'll inject a bit more of that Marvel-dilemma into the story. But this time I cannot be quite so sure of a sequel. None of the actors had signed a contract for more than two films and to be honest I think that there could be some problems with getting the entire cast to return. Academy Award winner Halle Berry might be the biggest trouble, but I certainly hope there won't be a problem a bigger paycheck can't solve. I don't care how much money the actors ask, give it to them they've earned it (on performance AND profit).
If the X - Men return, so shall I.

Final Destination," I do not think this is the Final Destination for this GREAT idea
","This movie is good people, you understand that. OK there are not big names in it nor in the cast, nor behind the chair, nor behind the pen, still it succeeds in doing something that I've have seen many films fail in over the years that featured big names. Of course I've seen failures with little names too, but that is not the point I'm trying to make here. The point I'm trying to make here is that how can a piece of sh.t movie like Mission to Mars be almost just as successful as this movie. I do not get it. I mean ,of course I thought, well, f.ck the reviews' and I went right on and saw Mission to Mars, but I wish I would not have. With this movie it was different, I was not too keen on going, actually I did NOT care if I saw it or not, because basically the Trailer was not too good and that is a pity. If the trailer would have been as good as the one for Mission to Mars (which had to be good, otherwise not so many people would have went to the cinema to watch that crappy movie), this film could have made 2 times the money it actually made at the box office.Another thing that I have to say here, is, that despite all the booing and wooing of the past about teenie / high school flicks I must say there certainly are a lot of them these days that are worth seeing. Of course these are not the 10 Things I hate about you flicks, but rather the films involving teens that are different'. Like Cruel Intentions, Scream, Scream 2 or last year's hit American Pie. There are really a bunch of great movies out there that centre teens and I feel that they are doing it great, for they are not only looking to make the eye enjoy (as in sexy females and maybe gorgeous guy's) but there are stories there too. I mean these stories are not only better than some of the other stories out there, but they are really, definitely far better carried out. I mean two years ago or so, that The Avengers movie Trailer, it rocked, but what was the conclusion after watching it ? The film was carried out poorly. This one is actually a bit different, because the Trailer does not stand out, but the movie itself does, because it was carried out very good.On to the film itself, what was good and what was bad? Well bad there is not much to say there, actually there is nothing to say there. What was good, well let's get onto that in a bit, but first of all, what about the actors? Well they all get their job done and that is what counts, they are all good. No outstanding folks here, nor on the Oscar nor on the Razzie side. While I'm on it, I must say that the film was not too thrilling, meaning you don't sit on the edge of your seat the whole time, but it was still entertaining enough.On to the good stuff, what did I like ? Man that is like a thousand things. I liked the direction very much, for it was very well, not only angles and stuff, particularly in the death scenes, but also in the way of filming. I mean this film had not the biggest budget and yet it's effects are believable and good which is due to a style of direction that admits just the right amount of good effects to be there. Also, of course, a good thing when connected with direction was the editing. It was done at the right times and in good ways. The music was good too, I mean I never heard of the woman doing the music in this film before, but she got her sh.t together man, it was good. Now on to the film in particular, talking favourite scenes. My favourite scenes are the inside view of the exploding plane and deaths 2, 4 and of course 5. These are my favourite scenes, not only because they are carried out well but because they are somehow surprising (which counts only for the death scenes 2, 4 and 5). The surprise element is somehow too, the thing I liked very much in this film. You never knew exactly how someone was gonna die until it actually happened and even when you guessed it somehow was different than the most scenes I've seen in my life (that death scene 4 really surprised me in the way of how (the place) he was killed). Enough about the film and it's makers, what about the story ? It was not only inventive and new, but it also was smart, for it reflects a thought all humans have. Death is destiny and you can't escape death. OK there have been many films involving death or Satan, but few, really few were able to be original and bring to us a new dimension. This one did though and we should be glad it did.The ending of the film is very good, for it leaves questions open plus it leaves the possibility of a second instalment open too, so it is good for both the viewer and the makers. Believe me, I do not like every sequel (although I'm pretty sure they are making a sequel to this one), but I sure like an ending like this one, for it is quick, abrupt and does not answer all the questions. Plus I found the sarcastic song at the credits rather funny too.

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The Dusk of an Epic Trilogy
","Contrary to my other reviews of The Lord of the Rings film, this review is based only on one screening. I have decided to do so, because on the day that I went to see The Return of the King I felt good in my skin and I could thoroughly enjoy the movie. I didn't look as closely as with the other two films at differences between the film and the book and that made the experience more pure and wholesome and therefore two screenings are not necessary to come to a conclusion about the quality of the movie.
What I really loved about the movie was it's beginning. Heck that was great. One of the most fine moments in the whole of the trilogy, together with the very ending and the scenes with Shelob I presume. Those are the scenes that make the whole trip (3 hours and 21 minutes) worth while. Now almost three and a half hours may seem very long for a film, but will not seem long I can assure you, although the first hour and a half seems to pass much slower than the remaining two hours, that never got boring. Of course there are those critics that say that Peter Jackson seems to knit ending to ending to ending and that the whole becomes too ling, but I as one who has read the book, expected that and am greatly satisfied with the skill of Peter Jackson in knitting the endings together in a way that does not make the film look too lengthy.
This is not too say that I am without criticism. I have some, but it just minor criticism and it criticism of the man himself (Peter Jackson). I do not want to belittle his achievement in bringing The Lord of the Rings trilogy to the screen. He has done great. The battle sequences look great (look out for the scenes with the elephants' versus the riders of Rohan), the acting is good and the directing is superb in my opinion, but he also did some things that I deem unnecessary. I could not quite put my finger on in while I was watching The Two Towers, but while I was watching The Return of the King it suddenly I could. The thing that bothered me a bit during Two Towers and even a bit more during The Return of the King were some of the dialogs (actually monologues), which reminded me of brainless action comedy's and actually added nothing to the film itself. An example of monologues like that is the counting of the victims by Gimli and Legolas or the comment Gimli has when Aragorn utters his plan to save Middle Earth. Also I felt that the burden Frodo was bearing was not emphasized enough in this film and it was slightly overshadowed' by the large amount of battle scenes. I know these are tiny things and I do not want to imply that this spoiled my viewing experience. What I want to point out by stating this, is that while The Return is definitely a good film and an improvement over The Two Towers, it is not a perfect film.
At the end of this 10 hour journey I'd like to say a few things. About the trilogy in general. First of all I cannot believe how well Elijah Wood acted and carried the film. My initial reaction to his casting was: He'll ruin it.' but I have to say that he did an incredible job. The other actors did a fine job as well as did everybody who was part of this epic adventure. There are flaws (as described in my three comments including this one) in the films, but they still are good watching material. The Fellowship of the Ring is in my opinion the best film of the three (8,25 out of 10) as it is a great introduction to the world of Middle Earth and it's characters. The Two Towers was solid, but I felt that it could have been better and it is in my humble opinion the worst film of the trilogy (7,5 out of 10). Second best in the trilogy is The Return of the King, which despite above mentioned criticism is a good ending to a good trilogy. The Lord of the Rings trilogy is what I had hoped The Matrix trilogy would be. It failed. The Lord of the Rings trilogy and all involved in the making did not. Thank you for that.

Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A long Time ago...
","(about 10 years, if I remember correctly) in a galaxy not so far away (if I'm correct it was even in this galaxy) I watched Star Wars for the first time and I immediately fell in love with it. So much even that I bought it on tape 5 years ago or so and when the Special Edition came on to the big screen I went to see it, all new, shiny and beautiful. Now I've got that Special Edition to my avail too and if I'm lucky I'll be seeing it on DVD in a couple of years, just as I hope I'll see The Phantom Menace on DVD in the next couple of years.
Yesterday was the time for me, to go back in time and let my inner child be satisfied with the beginning of Luke Skywalkers adventures in this grand epic tale. But for me it was more than that. It was also some kind of a warmer upper for the next episode for which I'll have to wait another one and a half years  SIGH -. And I must say again I was not disappointed with this movie (how could one be). It was as perfectly made as ever, bearing in mind the fact that this is the introduction, for this one is not as full of action as the other two episodes of this trilogy. Despite the fact that this is just the beginning I must say that George Lucas did a good job on this film. OK some of the effects are not too good compared to modern standards and neither is the editing or the action sequence direction (if you want to know what I mean, see The Phantom Menace and then watch this). But hey it was the 70's back then and you just compare event movies on this level from 1977 to moves from 1999. There you had all the critic I have about this masterpiece, which is and will be a true classic for me as long as I live. The reason for this film being classical are many, like the fact that it was the first real big event movie with good effects (outstanding for its time and budget) and also a good story, which is held together by the perfect portrayals of all the main characters (none of whom I'll have to introduce to you I bet, but I'll do it anyway). First of all of course there's Luke Skywalker, a young, maybe a bit naive, nice boy with a lot of hope and ideals who becomes entangled in the fight for freedom in this galaxy far, far away. Then there is Han Solo, an outlaw who smuggles and cares for nothing but money. Then of course Princess Leia, who immediately likes Luke and kind of dislikes Han Solo. Besides these characters there are also the 2 androids on the good side. R2D2, the always beeping repair droid and C-3PO the protocol droid, who is always a bit pessimistic and who delivers quite a few jokes. Not as many though as Han Solo, with his dry comments and his kind of odd way he addresses the princess. On the other side there is Darth Vader, whom all of you know and who is in my opinion the best villain ever. Never have I felt such emotions watching a villain on screen and even now there are times when my hairs just stand up when I hear him talk or do something.
All of this is what made and makes this film trilogy so good and big. It is exciting, fun, moving and the characters are great. You immediately fall in love with all of the good guys in this movie. And that is also why episode, the Phantom Menace was just about as good as this one. I compare this episode A new Hope to The Phantom Menace because they are very much alike, for they both are introductions to a trilogy. The latter had nothing that truly moved you like in this one, but I must say, the well choreographed fighting scenes and the good effects made up for it. Maybe in The Phantom Menace there should have been more comedic elements as in this one and the characters should have been more gripping and adorable, but hey you can't have it all. Plus the people in The Phantom Menace were children and still had to develop many of their character. There are a few things I want to say here at the end of this comment about The Phantom Menace. As I mentioned in my review for that film, I would be seeing it on the big screen again, when it came to our little HELLHOLE  cinema and I did do so and there were some things that struck me when I saw it again. I am now certain that The Phantom Menace is not flawless (too much aimed at kids, no epic and moving scenes and other stuff you can read in my Phantom Menace review) but it is good and there is one thing I even liked better when I saw it for the second time and that would be Natalie Portman's acting. She did a wonderful job as Queen Amidala / Padmé Naberrie. She is the only one, I felt watching the movie for the second time, who was already up to the standards of characters in Star Wars which were set in 1977. Which brings me right back to this film. The Special Edition really is worth a look (for me even a buy) for the picture quality is much better than the original, plus effects have been improved and scenes altered. But it has not been done to such an extent that you will feel differently about this version' than you did feel about the original.
Watch, enjoy and may the force be with you..always.

Tarzan," You can call me a big, 19 year old child, but I know I liked this one
","This is really a good effort from Disney, for they are able to pull something off many movies do not succeed in, they have made an interesting, exciting, moving and funny film. It is even harder, I presume to do such a thing with a story that has been told often before and everyone knows and then to get it done good as an animated feature is even harder. This is (in my opinion) a much better effort than for instance A bug's Life (I haven't seen Dinosaur, Mulan and Toy Story 2 yet) and that is the reason why for me it is the studio's best effort since Hercules.
What I really admire in Disney's animated features is how real they are. It becomes less obvious that it is an animated feature every time I see one and a lot of computer animation is used also. The high point of reality I feel is that the character of Jane Potter (voiced by Minnie Driver) even resembles the person who gave her the voice a bit at some points. But that might be just a bit subjective for I really like Minnie Driver and I immediately knew it was her when I heard the voice, so maybe I'm just imagining things. What I do know though is that Jane and Terk (voiced by Rosie O'Donnell) were my favorite characters and not, as you might expect Tarzan (which by the way does not mean that Tarzan sucked and you did not feel for him).
My advice to all (young or old) is to see this movie for it is not a movie for kids only

Jackie Brown," The Tarantino Pentathlon Part 4 - Through his eyes, but not by his hand: Jackie Brown
","Different, but the same
Jackie Brown was the first (and until now the only) film that was directed by Quentin Tarantino, but written by someone else. The film was based on a novel by Elmore Leonard called Rum Punch. Now despite the fact that Tarantino did not write th e story of the film itself, his hand is very visible in the dialog. There are lines and conversations in this film that I consider to be typical of Quentin Tarantino (the same phenomenon can be found in From Dusk till Dawn). These conversations are mostly about nothing or do not really matter as far as the plot goes, but still they are interesting and entertaining to see,because they are gripping and sometimes even funny in their simplicity. I truly believe that the reason for Tarantino's brilliance partly stems from the fact, that he does not hide the amount of ridiculous conversations a human being has on a day. He shows us just how often we do that and he sometimes even exaggerates it. I must say though, that in this film, he stays on the normal side of conversations and despite the fact that there are some Tarantino tendencies to be found in the conversations, the man himself does not go quite as far as in his preceding two directorial offerings.
Now Jackie Brown has what you might call an ensemble cast, with Robert DeNiro, Samuel L.Jackson, Michael Keaton, Bridget Fonda and Pam Grier, but that does not suffice to make a film good of entertaining. In my opinion Heat would be a pretty good example. That film had lots of names attached to it, but did not get much further than mediocrity. This film is different though. The actors have all been perfectly matched to the characters they are supposed to play. There was no actor or actress here that made an Academy Award winning performance, but every actor (including Chris Tucker) got his part down good. I was really impressed, especially by Pam Grier. Now I don't really now any of her other work, but judging from the sort of films she made, I would not assume that she could play that well. I guess it just all depends on the part you get and the director you work with.
This film has a running time of 150 minutes, which I would say is pretty much for an ordinary Gangster film without too much action, but throughout the entire experience there never ever is one part that is too long. Everything done in this film is done with some thought and every scene is made perfect by the chemistry of the subtle camera movement, the actors and the music. Now I'm not the sort of folk you would catch listening to any of the music played in this film, but I felt that they underscored the events taking place on screen to maximum effect. Tarantino has really emphasized that he is the master when it comes to combining picture and songs to enhance the impact of the film. The music is not there to sell the soundtrack, as is the case with films like Daredevil or The Blair Witch Project 2, it is there to make you feel the movie. Tarantino does not want you to watch his film. He wants you to experience it. Jackie Brown may not be as thrilling as Reservoir Dogs and it may not be as cool and mysterious as Pulp Fiction, but it still is an enjoyable experience. There are many directors out there who would love to have a film this good on their resume (not to mention the cast) and still Jackie Brown is not as good as Tarantino's preceding directorial offerings.

Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Saga continues...
","with this masterpiece of the Star Wars saga, which in my opinion is the best part of the whole series. I always thought that way and I guess that will never change. Of course I got some criticism, but it is basically the same I have for Episode IV and that would be that the special effects seem not as good as they once did, which is basically due to the enormous change and improvement on the special effects department. Besides that though I do not have any criticism on this film. As with the other Episode I also am talking about the Special Edition here and I must say that Lucas has done some good improvement with this Episode as well. There were a bunch of altered or added effects, like explosions and a few scenes in the city in the clouds, but the part that was altered best, I think, was the one in the beginning involving the creature in the snow. There were really some good scenes integrated here, which all looked very real. Maybe besides the fact that there was just a little blood when Luke gave the creature that stroke with the saber. That might be another criticism of this film. I mean there is quite a bit of lightsaber action in which someone is hit (three scenes) and it just appears that there is almost no blood lost. This might be regarded as a bit unreal by some people, but I was satisfied with that, for I am used of it since I was just a little kid and I think it was much better than the stuff that happened for instance in Indiana Jones (which I saw when I was about 11 or so) . For those scenes at the end of the first Indiana Jones really gave me the creeps when I watched that film for the first time and I had quite a couple of nightmares afterward. Whereas nothing of that kind happened after I had seen any of the thee old' episodes of the Star Wars Saga about a year earlier.
What I especially like about this film is, of course the battle on Hoth, right at the beginning, which starts this episode of the epic tale. In this film there are much more elaborate and much better battle scenes. But not only on Hoth, but also on the city in the clouds. I'm not talking about those laser fights here, but I'm talking about the lightsaber duel between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, which is so much better than the saber duel in Episode IV between Obi Wan and Vader. Last but not at all least there is much more character development in this one than in Episode IV and that also is what makes this such a great film. Besides all that, this film also introduces us to Yoda, (well if you've not seen Episode I that is) and the Emperor, who is the driving force behind the oh  so evil Vader. Speaking of which, he is really evil in this film. I mean if you thought you have seen his full wickedness in the first part you are so wrong. This man really is unpredictable and bad to the bone. His heart has been, you might say, destroyed by the dark side of the force, which is composed mainly of fear and hate.
Yoda is though important not that much of a main character, than you'd expect. He is just the person who is responsible for the upbringing' of the Jedi knights and who has been responsible for that for about 800 years. Although he seems quite useless and strange at the beginning, he actually is quite smart and helpful for Luke in this Episode in which Luke sees his connection with the Force reach a higher level. While Luke and Yoda prepare for battle Han and Leia are just making time fly by with a lot of jokes and action. I really must say here that Harrison Ford is great as Han Solo, who in this Episode (again) delivers most of the jokes. He is quite the scoundrel (as Princess Leia rightly noticed) and he is by far my most favorite character in the whole series, for his one  liners and his conversations with Princess Leia will always be remembered by me. My other favorite comedian from the first film (C  3PO) is not on such a roll as in the first one, but he still is pretty funny. The fact that Han Solo is my favorite character does not mean I do not like Luke, or I do not sympathize with him. It is just that if I wanted to be a character in Star Wars I would want to be Han Solo, because I think he is coolest and because I think if I could be someone in this Saga I could be Han Solo.
Besides all that, there happens something in this Star Wars film, that is well known and remembered by all fans of the Saga and it is something I do not want to spoil for anyone of you who has not seen this film (if there are such persons). All of the fans will know what I'm talking about and I think that is the biggest and most important event of the whole saga and by far the most touching one too. It brought tears to my eyes when I saw it again, something I would not have expected. It was just done so well, I really must applaud everyone who took part in that scene and of course George Lucas and John Williams, who in my eyes is the god of Scores.
Watch, be blown away, surprised and moved.
May the force be with youalways.

Sin City," The inevitable return of Robert?
","I must confess that I wasn't too sure about this movie. I mean Robert Rodriguez used to be great. Heck that guy was on my TOP 5 favorite director list back in 1996 after I'd seen his films and let me tell you they were all great. From El Mariachi and Roadracers to Desperado and From Dusk 'till Dawn. Bu then came the slow demise of Robert Rodriguez...The Faculty was only OK in a teenage horror kind of way...Spy Kids sucked so bad, I didn't even bother with 2 and 3D...and finally he messed up with the Mariachi's in Once upon a Time in Mexico. That guy was scraped off the list, almost as fast as he'd gotten on there. But then there came rumors about a graphic comic book adaption and I got really psyched...I started hoping where I'd lost hope and I must say that when I saw the trailer I was as scared as I was relieved. I mean it certainly looked as if the 'good old' Rodriguez was back, but in a way I was scared. The trailer looked a lot like 'style over matter' to me and I was not sure he'd pull it off. For him to do that he'd really had to get that comic feeling in to it...Well he did. As soon as the film started I got sucked into Sin City and wasn't allowed out until the ending credits rolled. Sin City is really exciting stuff. Although there isn't much of a background to the characters you care for them and feel with them, which actually is kind of an accomplishment since they are mainly bad guys...the thing about it is though, there are worse guys. No matter how depraved and bad the heroes in this picture are, they all have a heart somewhere and despite all of their sins they are still human. This is particularly evident with Marv (Mickey Rourke), who is very mean and brutal and yet you somewhat condone what he is doing. In a way this film makes you an inhabitant of Sin City. Your values fade, your rules are bent and you come to accept that everything that happens on screen happens by the rules. That is what great film-making is all about.Rodriguez couldn't have pulled it off without a great cast though and I must say that everyone fit the picture here. I was especially taken by Marv (Mickey Rourke) and Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro). As far as the ladies go, I must say that there while they were much more shallow than most of their male counterparts I sort of had a soft spot for Nancy (Jessica Alba). My least favorite character was Shellie (Britanny Murphy), whom I really couldn't connect with at all. I just felt that she was odd. The rest of the characters and actors ranged from adequate to the above mentioned 'greats'.The visuals were another certain plus to the film, as it helped you in getting into the comic surreal feeling of the film and accepting everything that happened there. I'm not talking about the rules of the street here, but about the more unconventional stuff, such as the the Yellow Bastard, the sheer invincibility of some of the main characters and the comic brutality depicted in this film. The film just had that comic book character that made believe everything you see. It was almost as if I was flipping through an old Batman comic. It was just great...and so original. Hats off to Rodriguez and to Miller of course who had his share in the directing (and the writing of course). On account of this I say: ROBERT = BACK. Too bad about The adventures of Shark Boy and Lava girl in 3D though. Well I guess I can live with him doing that, as long as he keeps popping films like these out every now and then (9 years is way too long though).8,5 out of 10 (with an 8 given upon voting)",8,1,2,12 June 2005
Braveheart," Well really someone with a Brave heart
","This film is about a man, William Wallace (whom if you take the time and look for it, can find in an encyclopaedia, although nothing much there is mentioned). He is a man, from Scotland who would have loved to live in peace and harmony with a wife and children, but sees his dream killed of by a brutal Englishman. He then becomes enraged and focuses on bringing freedom to his country by beating the bush  robbers, who call themselves English on the head and so chasing them out of his country.
In this film Wallace though has not got many friends, although he is worshipped and respected by the people, the Scottish nobles are not on his side. They rather got more scraps of land from the Englishmen and see their own folk slaughtered than help. So he is betrayed by his own, called nobles' and it was then much like it is now. The rich sacrifice the poor, there is fuss amongst men who are supposed to back each other up.
Now on to the film. This is a truly worthy film of a best director and best film Oscar, cause apart from Se7en and Murder in the First this is the best film of 1995 worthy of an Oscar (not counting action vehicles and sci-fi here, cause they are not going to get an Oscar for best film). The actors are all great, up front of course is Mel Gibson himself as William Wallace but there are other great actors in here. For instance (I believe it was) Tommy Flanagan as the crazy Irishman, Angus MacFayden as Robert the Bruce and of course Sophie Marceau as princess Isabelle. Here I really must compliment the casting director or whoever it was who picked these people. The best thing though about the characters is yet, that you feel for them and with them, especially Mel Gibson of course. This film, it's direction and it's music a few times really brought tears into my eyes and I'm not ashamed to say, that in the end I cried (not what you'd call crying, with sniffing and stuff, but yes, tears rolled and my nose became all runny.What makes this film such a treat for young and old, is that it contains everything that makes a film worth looking at it for three hours. It contains comedy, romance, revenge, brutal war scenes (which is the only thing you may dislike here), betrayal and a good and basically true story about a freedom fighter in  time in which his homeland was brutally ruled by the British. Ok I know most of the surrounding plot is probably made up, but that's what is so great, uniting a true story with fiction and there is nobody around today, who can tell you how it really was, so let your imagination rule and be not too rational.What I also liked is that in this film you get the sphere of being in middle age. There are for instance saga's told about Wallace that make him 7 feet tall and say that he slaughters men by the hundred's. Also this film has a great moral it tells us that freedom is one of the most important things in life and that it is not treasured enough by those who have it and don't know what it is like living without it. Also there is something that can be applied to this time also, and that is that everyone dies, but not everybody really lives. These two things ought to be bared in mind by many people on this earth.
A great feature of Gibson's directing career, although it is only his second and a masterpiece that follows well in the footsteps of the good and underrated The Man without a face. I urge Mel Gibson, to again direct a film and make it at least as good as the past two. I know he will, cause he takes his time on choosing his director projects as you could see, cause Fahrenheit 451 still has not been made until today and is now I presume officially cancelled although it had been planned for about 2 or three years.

True Romance," The Tarantino Pentathlon Part 3 - By his hand, but not through his eyes: True Romance
","It all depends on your definition of Romance
After the surprise success of Reservoir Dogs, Quentin Tarantino managed to get another of his writing efforts made into a film and the result, which is called True Romance, features quite a lot of blood, profanity and some strange dialog. True Romance is basically a romantic thriller and by that I mean romantic in the really broad sense, because for most people romantic is when you have a candle lit dinner under the stars. The main characters in this film though, Clarence (Christian Slater) and Alabama (Patricia Arquette), do not do that sort of stuff and I must say that, although I understand their feelings for each other, they really have a screwed up definition of the word romance. 
The thrilling element of the film comes from the fact, that almost throughout the entire film, Clarence and Alabama are hunted by a bunch gangsters who want to kill them. Now Clarence and Alabama are no angels, but when they are not in the criminal circle both of them are very open and pretty cool, so not matter what happens, you start to like them and feel for them. This enables the film to maintain a pretty high level of thrill throughout, except for the scenes where nothing of that tension shines through and it is as if Clarence and Alabama have a life without worries and this is what gives True Romance a weird, yet original touch. I do not know if this touch made the film worse than it could have been, but I certainly cannot imagine the film without it.
There are some similarities between True Romance and Reservoir Dogs. First of all, the events in True Romance also happen in a criminal milieu. Second of all, there is quite a lot of profanity and blood. And third of all, there is (as in Reservoir Dogs) some strange dialog, which I think only Tarantino could have produced. I mean everybody who has seen Reservoir Dogs remembers a couple of crazy dialogs from that film, like the scene in which all of the guys are talking about the meaning of the song Like a Virgin' or the scene in which the nick-names' are given to the gangsters. True Romance features a couple of dialogs like that also, for instance right in the beginning, when Clarence talks about Elvis to some blond in a bar or when Clarence's dad (Dennis Hopper) tells some gangster from Sicily, where his ancestors come from. I enjoyed those dialogs and I think together with the ending monologue by Alabama, those are probably the best lines in the film.
Overall, this is not a bad film, but it seems to lack that extra something. I feel, that the viewer is not sucked into the story enough and I also feel, there are some scenes which need some work, for they feel awkward or are unnecessary bloody and / or emotional. Those scenes include the interrogation scene with Dennis Hopper, the last scene with James Gandolfini and the last scene with Chris Penn. Don't get me wrong, this is by all means a good effort, but it is not good. Maybe Tarantino should be the only one allowed to direct Tarantino stories.

Gladiator," Good, but could have been Magnificent
","NOTE: Before you read my rating you must be informed that as I was watching this film at the CAROLUS theatre in Nijmegen (Netherlands) at 13.30 on Saturday the 20th of may 2000 there was a constant disturbance by two people in the back, who talked all the time. Except during the break, then they kept quiet, of course. I must also say that I despise thy, thoucompanions and thou friends, who spoil other peoples movie experiences, simply because thy don not appreciate the movie or because thy behave in the same way at home, where you watch movies on TV. If it is the first than, please go away and if it concerns the latter, than please, wait 6 or 8 months and rent it, for then thy can speak to thy companion and do anything you like and not spoil it for others as well!!!!!!!!!This might have affected my final rate for the film!!!Now for my review, of course Gladiator was good. It had a lot of action, which was brilliantly coreographed and filmed by the way, quite a lot of blood (though the film was not very gore) a great soundtrack, good actors, especially Russell Crowe (as the revenge driven Gladiator), River Phoenix (as the psychopathic ceasar) and Connie Nielsen (as the suppressed and terrorised Lucilla). But I also liked Djimon Hounsou and Ralph Möller a lot. The plot actually was good too there were just 2 bothers if you ask me, first of all there are far too many boring politics involved for this action  revenge pic, plus there are a few visions, Crowe had in this film that I found very unfitting, especially that in the end. Oh yes I almost forgot, I didn't like the ending very much. The basics were good but the was it was carried out was way too melodramatic. Standing there and stumbling for many seconds falling, then of course the FINAL words of the hero!! But there were more good than bad things here besides a lot of blood, sadness, sorrow, depression, madness, it all really made you feel for these people. I even had tears in my eyes at one point or two, just as I had with another epic film I saw, which is another classic in my eyes and funny enough has somehow a similar plot (as for the basic revenge story), Braveheart. These are the two best epic classics of the past 10 years and surely two films that may not be missed.As you may have noticed I found the ending rather bad, regarding the rest of the film, this is also the reason, why I say, Gladiator was good, when it could have been HUGE, GIGANTIC, EXCELLENT, it could have been TITANIC!!!But it still is a classic, so stop reading and go see it!8 out of 10",8,0,0,21 May 2000
Princess Mononoke," Japanese anime: bigger, longer and uncut
","Generally I am a real fan of animated films and since Hayao Miyazaki's films seem to be of very high quality I recently felt to give one of his films a try despite not being too keen on Asian anime. The only film I really liked was Vampire Hunter D to be honest and I can assure you that I've seen my share of Manga 'classics' (Akira and Ghost in the shell). I had a feeling though that Miyazaki's films would be more mainstream Hollywood style, since he has become something of a trade name since making this film and the academy award winning Spirited Away. After seeing this film, I was somewhat disappointed. Despite the fact that the film had some of the makings of a great adventure film, I just could not get used to the many fantasy; god/demon elements. From the start I felt that the films core the film had a dangerous equilibrium, which it managed to maintain during the first hour. The first hour was pretty exciting and interesting but in the second hour the weight on the 'boring' scale just got bigger and bigger. It was not as if Miyazaki did a bad job directing, but I felt that he put too much weight on the whole moral/mystical part of the film where more emphasis on the action would have made the film tighter. Maybe though it wasn't the emphasis alone, I also felt that some of the scenes were excruciatingly long. Or maybe it is safe to say that I'm not into the whole Asian 'spirit thing'. I mean I didn't like The Ring or Ju-On one bit and I didn't care much for this one either. The only thing I actually can appreciate in Asian (specifically Japanese) films is the amount of violence they use and the way in which it is often comic. There were a couple of instances in this film as well where I felt the violence was so over the top that it became funny. Too bad that isn't enough to keep a film interesting for 128 minutes. Miyazaki should have kept this one standard Disney-length (with a maximum of 85 minutes).5,25 out of 10 post scriptum: the English subs were really bad, cause last time I checked 'arigato' meant 'Thank you.' and not 'Good luck.'",5,5,16,30 April 2005
High Fidelity," Good film
","This is a pretty good film, although for a so called comedy, I found it to be not very funny. It was rather an analyses of a man's life, focusing on his relationships and his love for music. I must say that the cast was great and that the film really makes you think about your own life (past, present and future). I like that a lot. Very different from many other films I have seen. Great soundtrack too.

The Island," THX - t.e.s.t.o.s.t.e.r.o.n.e.
","It has been mentioned often that this film borrows a lot from other Utopian / futuristic films (for me most notably THX, because of the white suits and the setting) and actually I've read that it is a remake of a film called The Clonus horror, The Island can be seen as a film in itself. While I admit there is a lot of borrowing I cannot get why people are upset by this. If people go on like that they might as well argue that Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula, exactly 70 years later, partially borrowed from Nosferatu (1922) in the case of the medallion of Ellen/Mina which is not in the Dracula novel. Also you can start moaning that For a few Dollars More is a remake of Yojimbo that A.I. - Artificial Intelligence is built around Pinocchio and Bicentennial Man by Isaac Asimov and on and on and on.....you get my drift. What I am saying is that this is all BLAH by people who hate the movie anyway...be it good or bad. What to say about the Island itself then? Well first of all let me say that the advertising was extremely bad. They make commercials for a film called THE 'bloody' ISLAND and during the whole trailer we do not get to see of hear anything about an island. Then there's a SPOILER: the 'I am Tom Lincoln scene' which ruins part of the movie, not to mention the good old from the director of...I MEAN REALLY; COME ON...that's not a reason to see a film so cut that crap out. The trailer would have been much better if it had been on the lines of...IN THE FUTURE...AFTER A CONTAMINATION...THERE ARE BUT TWO PLACES SAFE FOR MANKIND...AN OFF-SHORE PLANT WHERE MANKIND IS TO WORK AND REPOPULATE...AND A REMOTE AND MYSTERIOUS OASIS CALLED THE ISLAND...BUT WHAT THEY DO NOT KNOW...THERE IS NO ISLAND...THERE'S ONLY DEATH then cutting towards some gruesome scenes and some action...'THE ISLAND'...OPENS...! Blame the producers for the BOMB, not Scarlett and Ewan and don't bother blaming Michael. It's too easy...I mean when they actually advertise 'By the director of Armageddon and Pearl Harbour' everybody knows what they'll get. I mean it's like complaining when you go see a Woody Allen movie and and get out saying 'I can't believe he played a neurotic dud AGAIN.' Of the whole movie I liked the first hour best, because there was actually quite a lot of plot and it was interesting to see 6-Echo (Ewan McGregor) and 2-Delta (Scarlett Johansson) out in the world. In that first hour the film was very variable as well. There were some touching, some funny moments and it was generally interesting and well paced unlike for instance THX-1138 which drags on and on and in 88 minutes covers what this one does in 45 or so. Then the film becomes THX on testosterone. Huge explosions fights and, well... all the Michael Bay stuff. Don't get me wrong, I like big bangs and stuff but Michael, well it's all too 'produced' for me. Really I mean his films are like 2 hour commercials...everybody looking so styled even when they just went up in flames...and the colors...plus I think his trademark camera-work is getting older than John Woo's white pigeons. Anyway, I felt that the second hour wasn't nearly as good as the first one, for it dragged on too long. I get that feeling often nowadays with movies. It seems to me that they have plot for something like 100 minutes but they try and stretch it to just over 2 hours with elaborate action scenes and 'not quite yet' endings. Too bad filmmakers want to tie everything up nowadays...I felt the same way with Mr. and Mrs. Smith which I felt dragged a bit in the end too...but maybe that's just Hollywood.I generally do not dislike Michael Bay although I must say I didn't like Bad Boys II. He is what he is as is Kurosawa, Spielberg and Scorsese. I mainly went to the cinema to get entertained, see explosions and watch a beautiful Miss Scarlett...maybe see a plot. I was satisfied reasonably on three counts and very much on the third. Yet the length of the movie and some ridiculous action scenes (oh let's do that...we haven't seen it done like this and it will be more spectacular than the scene in...) spoiled a bit of the fun. Great work Ewan, Scarlett, Steve and the people from make-up. Michael...reconsider your style and what your doing at times.6,75 out of 10 (with a small 7 given upon voting)",7,1,2,17 August 2005
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Surprising (in a good way)
","After seeing the 'oh so acclaimed' Fargo and thinking it was nothing more than average, I was wandering if it would be a good idea to rent another Coen 'masterpiece'. This time I was much less disappointed than I was with Fargo and I must say that most of the credit for that goes to the good jokes and the good acting of George Clooney. Well done Mr. Clooney, make more of these and less 'Perfect Stormish' movies. You can act and you showed it here.7 out of 10",7,1,1,30 December 2001
