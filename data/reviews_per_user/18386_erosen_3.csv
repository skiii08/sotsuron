50 First Dates," fun movie!
","This was such a cute movie. Very amusing. Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler are great in this tale of a girl named Lucy with a fictional condition brought on by an accident involving a cow. Every morning she wakes up with no memory of anything that's happened since the accident. Adam 's character, Henry, happens to fall in love with her, and must make her fall in love with him again every day. Rob Schneider provides additional comic relief as Henry's buddy, a dread locked, one-eyed rasta mon. Sean Astin is amusing as Lucy's lisping, steroid-addicted, bed-wetting brother. It's not the typical laugh-after-laugh goofball Sandler flick, but it is pretty funny, and heartwarming. More of the chick-flick variety, although there's plenty of Sandler/Schneider interaction and walrus-schlong jokes to keep the guys interested! check out the soundtrack too, cool covers of 80s songs done reggae-style! great summer cookout music.",8,0,0,12 January 2005
The Village," Thought-provoking, entertaining, unexpected twists
","Chromium, if this is the WORST movie you've ever seen, you must not have seen many movies in your time. I'm jealous! I found this movie interesting with a cool twist that I didn't see coming. At its core is a traditional love story, along with exploring the psychology of fear in a community where the world around them seems beyond explanation. When you think of all we know in modern society, all that we have explained and can control, you wonder how fear influenced the lives of those who existed in a more 'innocent' time. It begs the question, is it better to know, or to hold onto innocence?{SPOILER}'It sounds a lot like a 20th century guy writing what he guesses 18th century people might have talked like' Um, YEAH, that is the point. These are people who grew up in the 20th century and are pretending it's 1897. If you don't see the end then you think the dialogue is weird and the monsters are cheesy-looking. When you find out what's really going on, it all makes sense.",7,0,0,9 February 2005
The Patriot," All Americans should see this movie!
","This film was a powerful, moving story of one family's experience with war and the fight for American independence.  I first saw this film a few years ago.  After the 9-11 terror attacks, I thought of this film often, as it is a classic tale of how sacrifices must be made so that future generations can have better lives.  This movie made it all seem so real, the way that the founding fathers of the United States had to live, their fears and obstacles, and what they must have gone through to fight for their vision of what this country could be.  While we obviously don't live in a perfect world yet, we don't have soldiers breaking down our doors and setting our homes on fire.  'The Patriot' makes you appreciate what others have gone through and the sacrifices made for us to have what we have today.  It is very real and emotional, and though at times it is hard to watch, it makes you proud to be an American!",9,0,2,3 December 2002
