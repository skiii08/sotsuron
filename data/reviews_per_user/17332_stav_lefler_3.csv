Deja Vu," Good show that doesn't fall into the usual traps
","Perhaps it's just Washington's presence, an actor who's always only somewhat serious about himself and about the characters he plays. Anyway, the movie as a whole doesn't seem to take itself too seriously, too. Therefore, in spite of several loopholes and inconsistencies, it provides good fun without getting too heavy or self- important. Points to Scott for that, and let's hope for more entertaining stuff by the Washington-Scott duo. What begins as a seemingly ordinary disaster film turns into a geek-pseudo-sci-fi high-action and even slightly romantic drama. When moving through time is introduced, it is done organically and, again, the movie doesn't make too much of a big deal about it, and - thank the gods - doesn't try to over-explain it. It remains, above all, a good show that's fun to watch.",7,0,0,24 October 2016
X-Men: Apocalypse," An hour too long, still an OK movie
","Throughout the movie I was in favor of the guy, Elohim, Ra, whatever. He was the only one who made sense and displayed a coherent agenda. But in the end, he (in my mind, symbolically, the MIND) doesn't win, because apparently he is alone, and wants to be fully in charge. So it looses to a bunch of weaker, emotion-driven beings. Oh wait, the mind has one emotion: rage. How clich√©. And: how come CGI fire STILL looks like CGI fire?!And: Why is Jennifer Lawrence held in high acclaim as an actress?A bit more humour than usual was apparent in this movie. But then again, he had to shove Auschwitz in there again, several times in this one. Oh, Brian.",6,1,7,28 May 2016
Arrival," A psyche-centred sci-fi work of art!
","A very thoughtfully made and thought-provoking movie. It balances extremely well an intimate look into the heroine's psyche with an original sci-fi premise. The heroine makes an enticing and touching character. Amy Adams' sensitive, even subdued (yet not muted!) performance is aided by a calm and supportive role played by Jeremy Renner, and a piercing performance from Forest Whitaker. They all help to create a low-key and very convincing atmosphere. Director Denis Villeneuve shows great skill in combining drama with a small and highly believable selection of visual effects which is done with the utmost attention to detail and show a true sense of aesthetic vision. This aspect of the movie is very impressive especially when considering the many temptations and over-the-top results out there nowadays... The design department and especially the conceptual artists who created the ships, aliens and visual symbols are worthy of praise.",9,4,10,2 December 2016
