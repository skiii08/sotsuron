The Avengers," Wonderful
","I have rarely laughed out loud over a movie but this one had me belly laughing and giggling all the way through. I loved how this movie brought most of the beloved super hero's together and how they played off each other. I gave it a 10 / 10 because of the pure enjoyment of the film. Usually when I sit through a movie I am mentally counting the minutes when I can get up and go, but this one I wanted to last longer. I am so hoping they come up with a 2nd movie, just as good. If you like super hero movies and love a good laugh go see this movie. It is well worth the time. I can not wait until the DVD comes out, it will be a sure buy for me.",10,6,13,14 May 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," How much is too much?
","Again, in my opinion this is another movie that should not have been made. I love super hero movies, especially Spiderman. I really enjoyed the older movies with Toby. Now a new hero and it all just seemed to go toes up for me. I did not enjoy this movie. I really hate remakes and extensions of movies unless they stay close to the original and carry off the heart of the original movie, like Pirates of the Caribbean, like Spiderman 2 and 3 with Toby. They did not feel like a new movie, they were an extension of the one we loved. Some movies are just done to death and the changes in actors just seems to sour things for you. I think this is what happened with this movie for me. It becomes a completely different beast then the original. I am no way saying this movie was bad. It was a good movie, it just ruined the whole Spiderman hero for me.",7,1,2,27 July 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," To much of a good thing?
","Well, what can I say. I am not saying the movie was not good, it simply was to much. There have been so many Batman movies that you begin to feel that you have just seen to many. I struggle with remakes and movies that are extensions of others. This movie was the continued saga of Batman begins. In my opinion it should have stayed there. I know what they were trying to do and say, but I just can not help feeling they have said to much. I don't want to add further to this as I do not want to ruin it for those who have not seen it yet. Is it a good movie? Yes. Is it perfect? No. Did it leave me sitting waiting for the film to end? Yes. I think I would have been happier if this movie had not been made. It was just to much and over the top in my opinion. I love super hero movies, so I really feel let down with this one. I adore the actors and believe me the acting was superb. It was just the movie itself.",8,1,3,27 July 2012
