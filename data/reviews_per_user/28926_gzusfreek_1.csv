United 93," Be aware of the camera technique!
","This camera technique caused us to leave before the movie was half way through. I was motion sick like never before. I'm not sure what the artistic point is to the films the that use this technique -- looks and feels like it was done with a home, personal video camera -- but it ruined this movie for us.I noticed two ladies down the row from us having the same problem, closing their eyes and getting up and walking out for periods of time, so I know it did not just affect us.Let me interject here that before last night I really, really wanted to see this movie. That I had read many a review and felt that it was an honor to 93's victims. I felt like I wanted to go and honor them at the same time.And the part of the movie I did see, seemed to be done tastefully and honorably. There were some unbelievable parts such as the over-friendliness of the flight attendants. I fly a whole lot and I have never seen a flight attendant so animated and bright, much less a whole plane full of them.I also must say that it was a little confusing as the switched back between the different control centers and towers. It seems to me a film maker could be a little more creative in giving his audience a obvious difference that showed which command was the FAA, New York, Boston, etc.But for me, I am so upset that it was ruined by the motion sickness. I am not one who gets car sick, plane sick, boat sick, etc. So I am surprised. I have felt queasy in two other movies, the Blair Witch Project, and The Bourne Supremacy, but both of those I watched from beginning to end. This one I could not stay a minute longer, I was going to lose it.I don't know how to find out about this before going to a movie, but I will do some research. I don't ever want to go to a movie done this way again.",4,8,17,6 May 2006
