Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," They Can't Fathom the Phantom menace!
","I've have to admit up front that I wasn't stunned in to awe and wonder by the new Episode One, but most of that was the utter joy of seeing something truly new and exciting in the movie house's of 1977!!  This is a serious expression of the story we've speculated and surmised all along.  And its delivery is in serious everyday conversational English.  The dialog is rather drab and straightforward.  The critics are having a field day because it's tepid and not profound! Believe me I wish it was the Gettysburg address for George Lucas, but it isn't.  Still, they need to lighten up, it was a most enjoyable 2 plus hours with inspirational cityscapes and graphics. The story goes along rather slowly and I missed the opportunities they had on Tatooine for the verbal jousting we had with Hans, Luke and Leia.  I think Mr. Lucas missed the boat on several character building moments that would of swept us into really caring for our heroines.  Natalie Portman is a joy, Jake Lloyd was just too unbelievable to possess his supposed skills at that age, but he plays a mean 9 year old well enough.  Ewan and Liam were all to serious and didn't get the range of acting their capable of.  The music wasn't intrusive and the effects were also mindful of the dialog, which I appreciate.  It's bad enough to scold an audience member, but to have the movie drown itself out is inexcusable. All is fair in Naboo and Tatooine for now.  I'll be there in 2001 to see how they proceed from here.  I give the experience a rousing 7 out of ten.  Go see this movie for yourself with the open mind of the youngster you were in 1977 and enjoy the renewal of the saga of good vs evil.",7,0,0,23 May 1999
Lawrence of Arabia," The Epic Cinema at age 10
","My first large screen experience was Lawrence of Arabia.  At the age of 10 in the largest cinema in Detroit I sat in awe as the opening motorcycle scene left this young man dead.  This I could understand and relate to. The desert, the Arab culture and the prejudice of the English I could understand.  The politics eluded me, but the majesty and the splendor of the presentation had me hooked!  Many more cinematic escapades I pursued: when they re-vitalized (restoral it wasn't) Gone with the Wind and brought it out in 70mm for the first time, the first cinerama I saw was How the West was Won and then 2001.  But when they restored Lawrence, I went back and I understood it all.  The same goosebumps and cinema thrills of a 10 year old with the experience of adulthood brought the struggle and the commitment of Lawrence and his Arab bretheren to the forefront.  This was a documentary, perhaps innaccurate, but It in essence is a true story of an English gentleman giving up a life of luxury to free 'his' people.  The dramatic license is used judiciously, with flair, and in the seductive setting that helped form the man, so be it.  In all the purpose of film is to escape and find yourself involved and intrigued.  Enjoyment is the name of the film game.  With the memories of childhood and the wisdom of age, the Lawrence epic is one of the greatest movies on record, worthy of a top ten.  I own many a disc, in Laser and now DVD, my first purchase was Lawrence.",10,0,1,20 March 1999
The Matrix," The Future is Retro
","The amazement on everyone's face... the future retro world, if it exists, set into play by the fuzzy logic of the king computer.  It's all hard to swallow for some, but I enjoyed the ride thru this amazing landscape.  It was a surreal experience to be sure, but the technical expansion of special effects into this landscape of 'unreality' makes it believable.  The concept isn't that far off the mark from any time travel adventure or fairy tale. Sit back and enjoy this film for it's fresh look at the good guys vs. the bad and reel-in the sonic and visual stimulation of the many effects sequences.  It's going to have precedence in the many copy-cat films to follow, using these highly original techniques for presentation of landscape, the fights and flights of our heroines.  See this film soon and pay attention to the faces... as you leave the theater!",8,0,0,17 May 1999
