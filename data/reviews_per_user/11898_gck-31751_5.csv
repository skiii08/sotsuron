","As the movie starts Phillips is on his way to perform his duty as a Captain of ship. This movie shows the intelligence of a Captain and his sacrifice for his team.

Forrest Gump," A good movie to show you don't need any extra ordinary skills to become a successful person.
","Run Forrest Run!!! If u didn't watch this movie, I seriously suggest you to watch this movie ASAP. It shows a person with no special abilities can also be a world class person (receiving awards from American Presidents). 'A stupid is as stupid does' one line that forrest recites every time remembering his mother. This has a lot of meaning in it. She insists her son not to agree with anyone who says ' I am better than you'. As a little boy forrest with a low IQ and problem in the spine faces a lot of problems with the society. But, his mother has a strong desire to get the best for his Son. In his childhood, he got to meet a little girl of his age who is the only friend of him in his entire childhood.

He is a natural guy who has no special qualities but, that becomes his special.",10,1,1,6 September 2015
Psycho," A cleverly made psychological thriller film which can take audience wherever Hitchcock wants.
","First of all I was disappointed to see the movie in B&W. But, after watching the movie I can clearly understand why Hitchcock had chosen B&W over colour. If you are also thinking like me, don't care about the colour just watch this.If you don't, you are just giving up on the 'mother' of all modern horror movies. No movie lover will take a risk of not watching Psycho. The cinema begins normally, in Phoenix, Arizona. The lead actress was a worker in a real-estate service corporation. She stole $40,000, which she had to put in bank and decides to leave the city. When she was driving, there must be scenes at her office and home to be shown. All we expect was to see those but not the face of the actress, but Hitchcock made a remarkable history to just show what is really needed. This makes you realize the mastery of Hitchcock. A psychological thriller which people didn't see till 1960, remains unaltered in its image.This connects to our minds directly. Norman Bates(Anthony Perkins), the owner of Bates Motel and a Momma's boy looks like a friendly person. His action really brought the movie to life. An great movie which makes us predict what happens next, but deceives us every time in a HONEST way. Coming to the part which contributed majorly to the movie's success, MUSIC. Bernard Herrmann's score is quintessential. The music he gave makes the movie appealing at the most famous scene 'Shower Scene'. The most frightening scene is the out-of-nowhere murder of the Private Investigator. The music helped a lot here too. By continuously shocking the audience, Hitchcock took the movie in his direction, righteously. At the end, the audience will be shocked again and this is most horrifying too.",10,1,2,13 November 2015
All Quiet on the Western Front," War is not all fighting. It has a lot more.
","This movie made me realize that what I thought of war till now is just 10% of the reality. This is a WW1 film which explicitly shows the in and out of War. At that time, the teachers persuade the students to get enlisted into the army. Getting excited by the words of the old teacher all the students got into the army expecting a beautiful army life. After they have entered the fields, they realized the real situation and felt that it is better back in school. But, now these innocent guys got into the army, they have to face the enemy. It shows the fear of these new recruits and the real difficulties they face. They began to see their friends in front of their eyes.This makes them feel to go back home. These new people, even don't know that even the army people suffer from hunger. They really expected a good life, but the reality turns out to be exactly the opposite. At one point of time, they feel like they are just living to die. Paul( Hero ) kills a man in protecting himself and later cries that he didn't actually wanted to kill. This shows the innocence. And later when he goes home on leave, he sees the same teacher persuading the minds of the young students to join the Army. This makes him angry and tells the truth and called by the students as a coward. He feels that he doesn't belong to home anymore and returns to the Army and eventually dies.",9,2,2,20 October 2015
Ben-Hur," An Epic, Spectacle, Masterpiece.....
","The first thing that strikes to me this movie is the Screenplay. To make a 3 hr 42 min movie not at all boring we need beautiful script also. And to present it to the eyes we need the imagination of the director in resonance with the creativity of the camera man. Combining all the efforts of those people, we are able to watch a visual wonder on the screen. Remember that this movie was made in 1959 when there are no sophisticated equipment as all the crew now- a-days have. This shows their humongous efforts put into making this movie. Into the story, two childhood friends become bitter enemies because of the religious difference. This turns into one of them being unjust to the other. Judah Ben-Hur( Jewish ) was put in jail, sent to serve on ships and his family members were sentenced to life imprisonment. After all Ben- Hur lives to take his revenge on his friend. The chariot racing in which Ben-Hur( who was not a prisoner now ) tries to defend himself and in the process his friend, who was trying to kill Ben-Hur gets killed by the accident. This scene was acclaimed( is ) as the best shot ever without any special effects. When Ben-Hur found his mother and sister, they were ill and they don't want to show up themselves in front of Ben-Hur. But at last they will be cured by Jesus.",10,0,2,14 October 2015
