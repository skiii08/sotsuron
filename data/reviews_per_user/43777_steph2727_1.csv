Walk the Line," Best acting I've seen in a while!
","The night after I went to see this movie there was documentary on Johnny Cash on TV. It's amazing the likeness in Phoenix and Cash...even down to the singing. The story is very accurate as well. To me it takes more talent to play a person than a fictionalized character who you become. My grandparents saw Cash/Carter in concert together and said it's amazing at the accurate portrayal of both. Be prepared to laugh, cry, this movie has it all. This movie is truly a tribute to the late Cash and Carter. Finally a movie you don't have to try and figure out what's going on....a nice trip to the movies. Witherspoon and Phoenix should go ahead and start make room for their Oscars!",10,0,1,29 November 2005
