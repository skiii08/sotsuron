","Awesome movie.The visuals, audio, and story = very, very cool. Very unique.The people giving this movie bad reviews have issues. The movie was far better than the trailer let on to be. I don't see how anybody could watch the trailer, decide they 'liked' what they saw, then saw the movie and decided it was junk.If you consider yourself a fan of fantasy, forward-thinking, capable of compassion, seeker of knowledge, and an open mind... do yourself a favor and go see this movie.The visuals and sound deserve to be experienced at the big screen.",9,3,9,2 April 2011
