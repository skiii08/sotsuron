Requiem for a Dream," Not for the highly sensitised viewer.
","If you have a leaning toward empathy, or sensitivity, don't attempt to view this film.  Brilliantly portrayed by the four main characters, the disturbing images almost caused me to wretch in the aisle at the theatre. Some of the imagery was so provoking that I had to look away, cringing, and hoping that no one would here my squeals of anguish.  I wanted to leave several times during the climax and denouement.  However, to the credit of Selby and Aronofsky, I could not.  I yearned for a ray of hope, knowing it unlikely, but feening for the conclusion.  I had to know how it would end, the gruesome imagery that my imagination would haunt me with fueled by the disturbance of the film, being worse than anything that I might see on the screen.  Of course the most disturbing piece was the knowledge that these engaging and pathetic folk walked a thin line between anyone you might meet. So utterly normal in their mania, the mere contemplation of their bitter trials and how simply the small doses became addictions, was disquieting.Not for the faint of heart, it takes courage to see this film.",Null,0,0,9 January 2001
