The Hangover," not as good as people say but it has its moments
","i cant be 100 percent sure why people think this movies is that good i mean it has funny parts definitely, but as a whole i didn't think it was that funny. other then Zach Galifianakis i didn't really find any one to be hilarious i rather hated the character of stu price played by ed helms finding him to lack in the humor department and he became quite annoying after sometime. Don't get me wrong this movie is funny especially the first time but upon multiple viewings it seemed to lose its touch where as some other movies that i have watched numerous times such as anchorman, step brothers, billy madison and hot rod just to name a few, have continued to make me laugh every time i watched them. in conclusion this movie is watchable, is funny and is entertaining but its just not as good as people have said it to be i rate it a 6. All i have to say is kudos to Zach Galifianakis for being hilarious and thank you to the people who made this for putting him in it cuz without him the story line is kinda boring.p.s. thank god that the character of doug disappears in this film Because He Is A Horrible Actor. thank you and good night",7,0,0,21 January 2010
Interstellar," A Great Sci-fi Film
","Interstellar is an awesome movie that I've heard a lot of debate about I can understand why people don't like it but personally I really enjoyed it. is Interstellar the best movie of the year 2014? probably not I still got to give that Gone Girl,I still have a few movies left to watch but I can't see anything taking that spot. Anyways back to the movie Great acting overall I really liked the duo of Matthew Mcconaughey and Anne Hathaway, Mcconaughey giving potentially the best performance of his career. I also really liked the robot tars he will be a very memorable character, but I have to say the best acting performance in this movie goes to Jessica Chastain she killed it in her role. I thought John Lithgow Was pretty good as well haven't seen him in a long time. Micheal Caine played Micheal Caine as usual but he seems to be pretty good at doing this I kept feeling like he was Alfred to McConaugheys Batman.lol. sadly though there were a lot of weak performances as well especially by Matt Damon who feels lifeless, Casey Affleck, David Gyasi, and omg the always terrible Topher Grace somebody pull a Paul Walker on this guy and help us clean up Hollywood of its trash. once again lol. The Directing on this film was Great as we have come to expect from Chris Nolan add in some really good writing and production mix in some stunning visual effects and great sound editing with a pretty decent score and you get this a very well made movie which should be enjoyed and not over analyzed. Other then a few weak acting moments, some really loud noises and the runtime, the only other problem I had with this movie was that it suffered from what I call the Lord of the Rings ending, which is when the movie presents many points where it can end perfectly and leave you guessing or feeling good about it but doesn't and just keeps going presenting more questions that you have to answer but you don't know why. I kept feeling like no.... what? end now i like this ending haha overall I recommend this movie 100% worth the watch if you have 3 hours to spare. It's gonna look great on Blu-ray. 8 out of 10",8,0,3,30 August 2015
Ant-Man," Great Superhero Movie
","This Movie hit me in the head out of no where, i didn't expect to like it as much as i did. I mean marvel never disappoints so i knew i would like it but it was really, really good. all of the acting throughout was solid, but i didn't really care for Corey Stoll very much they probably could have got some one better. Michael Douglas was good in it reminded me of the way Michael Caine can just play himself in everything but its still always good. Paul Rudd Was Fantastic in this bringing a lot of humor and some decent acting to the table, i cant picture anyone else nailing such an obscure character like Ant-Man the way he did. Evangeline Lily and Bobby Cannavale were both good in there roles. T.I., David Dastmaichain and Juddy Greer were all very funny in smaller roles. But by far and away the best most surprising Actor was Michael Pena who killed his Role in this film he was the best overall and most funny person in this whole movie. The Directing, production, soundtrack, editing, effects, stunts, writing were all great. This movie has a good story like with a good plot i have to say its one of the better marvel movies in the MCU in my opinion it felt like a Mash up of Guardians of the Galaxy and Iron Man which are to of my favorite movies let alone just superhero/comic movies. overall this movie is a 7.5 out of 10 which i cant give it due to stars so its a 4 out of 5 i recommend this movie to anyone its a perfect cross over of comedy adventure action and superhero movies so if you like any of those genres i cant see why you wouldn't like this movie.",7,3,13,30 July 2015
Now You See Me," Over The Top Magic
","a little bit of fun and some good Woody Harrelson that's about all i got from this film, the tricks are to confusing and seem impossible to pull off. I didn't believe anything that was happening they should have just made the tricks a little more realistic, the final 'illusion' was like what the hell just happened. Jesse Eisenberg Is always hit or miss with me ( ex. hit: Zombieland, Miss: 30 minutes or less ) and this movie was a miss he comes off as his normal pretentious self and in this movie it was just to much. I really liked Melanie Laurent and Mark Ruffalo as the detectives, Michael Caine and Isla Fisher (who's super hot) are both pretty good even though Caine plays him self as usual and I like the Morgan Freeman Character. To this movies credit it does have a lot of cool twists and had the right idea just went way to far. in conclusion if you like magic or thief/heist/con movies you will probably wanna watch this once and never again lol because they had a good idea my rating is 5 / 10",5,0,1,30 August 2015
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Nothing But Cheese
","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 where do I start, first of all its not all that amazing they should rename it the mediocre spider man 2. it's not that this movie horrible because it's not, well actually it is but i still think its better than Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 3, its definitely worse than its predecessor. But it has its moments mostly between Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield their chemistry is basically all this movie has going for it. This movie decently entertaining, good action scenes but not enough of them though with a very non epic final battle. I liked the introduction of all the new characters, and I like the idea of where it's going as a series but this movie just felt like a 2 hour filler to prepare us for what is next to come or at least a universe they were 'trying' to set up. I mean I've seen a lot worse movies as far as superhero/comic movies go, so I'm not even gonna hate as hard as i want too, I just expected a lot more as far as comparing it to other superhero movies that marvels pumping out recently down at Disney. They put out an amazing new captain America movie with winter soldier and Fox did it with X-Men Days Of Future Past, this movie is no where in their ball park but it's good enough for a one time watch just at laugh at the cheese factor acting job from Oscar winner Jamie Foxx who gives us one of the worst performances of his career playing a lesser version of Jim Carrey's Riddler from Batman Forever its almost not watchable, Dane DeHaan is also frigin terrible playing a worse version of the same role he plays in Chronicle, and don't even get me started of the phoned in cameo by Paul Giamatti, who even admitted he thought the role was a joke. Another thing I'm tired of with spider man in general is the teen angst if I wanted to watch Breakfast Club I would watch Breakfast Club. I'm also tired of how all the characters come off as awkward losers that just don't fit in. and for god sake I wanna see some blood enough with the pg ratings even the comics are more graphic then the movies. anyways. 5 out of 10 if anything at all because it was cheese watch",5,2,6,30 August 2015
Whiplash," One Of The Best Music Movies Of All Time
","This movie was amazing from start to finish, and to think I was gonna say forger it and not watch it for some reason(i thought it would be boring). Now i feel like an idiot for putting it off for so long. There is a good reason why this movie is nominated for Best Motion Picture for 2014 the acting performances are on par if not better than Birdman, Miles Teller oh my god, holy crap who the are you? Where did you come from? just wow enough said. I was dying to see him in Fantastic Four after seeing this, this kid is good, this kid can be great. how he was not nominated for an Oscar boggles my mind, I'm not saying he would have won but he should definitely have been nominated. mind you they didn't nominate Jake Gyllenhaal either and he killed everyones performance that was nominated. #biggestoscarsnuboftheyear anyways I'm getting off topic this film had Great direction great production great sound mixing and a lot of heart and emotion and let's not forget my boy J.K. Simmons who just blew me away with his acting skills that I didn't even Know he had. i mean i knew he was good but this role was great. the best supporting actor was all his for the taking(i think his only competition was Edward Norton in Birdman). any way this movie is a must watch for any movie lover its one of the best if not The best music based movie i have ever seen, maybe even one of the better movies i have ever seen as well 8 / 10",8,0,1,30 August 2015
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," A Must Watch Film
","What to say about Birdman...... The Acting in this movie is just on a different level the most movies could hope to even be, i mean of the last 10 or so years i would probably put Birdman and Whiplash in the 10 for acting. Edward Norton is my stand out in Birdman hes amazing I forgot he had this in him it's been a while since fight club but he showed his true power in this movie. not that hes ever really done poorly but this was just something special. Emma Stone and Oscars will be something you start to hear a lot together in the future, maybe even the near future she showed off her skill in this movie just with her facial expressions alone. Michael Keaton gives a career best performance as well showing some range i never knew he had. Throw in a great supporting cast with great performances from Zach Galifianakis, Naomi Watts and Andrea Riseborough, and you have one of the best movies maybe of all time if not.. then surely of 2014. And its not that i think that the plot and story line are even that great, i mean they're really good but its basically a midlife crisis story about a recovering celebrity, that happens to have a great script due to some fantastic writing that meshed the comedy and drama so well. Capped off with some of the most beautiful directing and cinematography i have ever seen in my life, the whole one shot style that just follows everyone around was amazing. This movie is a must watch for any Cinephile Movie Enthusiast 8 / 10.",8,4,8,30 August 2015
Straight Outta Compton," Straight Outta Compton is an awesome Music Bio Film
","Straight Outta Compton is a great movie. period. I'm not super surprised that it was good but i am surprised at how good it really was. This film is easily one of the best of 2015 maybe even one of the best music based films, or even one of the better biographical films of all time. The acting in the movie is pretty amazing given the fact that there is very little star power involved. The entirety of the cast is good in this movie, especially Jason Mitchell and Corey Hawkins who both have big futures ahead of them. Paul Giamatti was really good as Jerry Heller, but by far the stand out in this entire film was O'Shea Jackson Jr. just killing his role playing his own father Ice Cube. We cant forget about the music, The soundtrack to this movie is amazing and all of the live performances are really cool. i like the fact that they chose to play the actual music performed by the actual artist and just let the actors lip sync it, and this makes sense to me because i went in to this wanting to hear NWA and not some no name actors singing the songs. (which is what they did that screwed up the Biggie Smalls Movie *Notorious*). F. Gary Gray did a great job directing this movie its probably the best movie hes ever made and if not its the best since Friday. Though a few main points were missing from movie such as most of Dr.Dre's time at Death Row which was probably the high point of his musical career, working with the likes of Snoop Dogg who would become is most frequent collaborator and Tupac which came out to about 3 minutes in this movie. The Mid and Most Successful part of Ice Cubes Career where he hit album sales highs and starred in a bunch of movies, including two ground breaking movies with Friday which spawned 2 more movies and a cartoon show and Chris Tuckers Career, as well as Boyz N The Hood. Another couple missing points were Eazy E's helping legendary rap group Bone Thugs-n-Harmony get started, as well as MC Ren's Solo rap career or The D.O.C's anything really. all of these things are slightly hinted at but never fleshed out i can see that it would have been hard since the movie was already pretty long at a 2hr 27min running time, adding another 20 minutes would have made the movie drag to much. in conclusion this movie is great and is definitely worth a watch, i 100% recommend watching this movie at least once especially if you're into more old school rap. I rate Straight Outta Compton 8 out of 10",8,6,36,22 August 2015
