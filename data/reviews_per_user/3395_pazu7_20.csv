The Avengers," A 'Smash' Hit (Sorry. That was corny. But this film rulez.)
","I've never given a 9 rating to any action film... well, I think I rated Avatar pretty high, but that had to do with the overt political statement too. Avengers makes no specific political commentary and that has nothing to do with why I love this film. It's just an excellent ensemble cast and freekin mega fun. The writing and acting make it work. That's where most action films are lacking. Avengers has got genuine wit. Great subtext and character development. Dialogue. Deft banter. The way the relationships build is convincing and unforced. Plenty of camp, but well balanced and never becomes mockery. And the action is perfect. So many action films try to dazzle so much you can't tell what's going on. The Avengers goes totally ballistic in the concluding battle, but you can always tell exactly what's happening on screen. I am not going to go deep. I'll leave that to the pros, and there are already plenty of positive reviews. I just wanted to say that this is one of those rare big-budget action films that lives up to the hype. Major winner. Kudos to the makers. If the follow-ups are this good, the franchise will outlast the cast.",9,3,7,22 May 2012
Blade Runner 2049," An elaborate fan-fiction that somehow manages to completely miss the point.
","The thing is, Blade Runner didn't need a sequel. And even if it did, this wouldn't be it. It's not a 'bad' film. It's actually very scenic. Beautiful to look at. And the story is interesting. It's just not good enough to be a continuation of Blade Runner. Like Omar sez, 'if you come at the King, you best not miss'. If you're going to follow up on a classic like BR, you'd better bring it. Blade Runner is a poem. BR 2049 is a lengthy essay with liner notes. I've read a some people saying that BR had a complicated story line. No. The setting was complicated. The story is actually rather simple when you deconstruct it: (lite spoilers) Harrison Ford is a bounty hunter who wants to retire. He's forced in for one more job and meets a girl. For all the sci-fi it's still noir. Everything else is the setting BR 2049 however has a complicated and, imo, cumbersome storyline. I will not spoil it because, in spite of my criticism, I think it's actually worth a view. But the story is elaborate and there are twists and turns which provoke a lot of unnecessary and awkward exposition. In the original, except for the narration in the theatrical release (which was dropped in subsequent versions) the dialog did not get stuck in expositional meandering. But BR 2049 loads twists on top of complexity and misdirection and even after all that, it really never captures what was great about the first film. You will find nothing even close to Rutger Hauer's iconic death soliloquy in this new film. The dialog is borderline rote.The real beauty of the original is Ridley's Scotts visual and sonic poetry. It has genuine and original atmosphere which is strange and familiar at the same time. Scott's use of light and shadow creates haunting scenes. It's so beautiful you could watch it with the sound off... (but then you 'd miss the wonderful Vangelis score, which produced a hit, 'Love Theme from Blade Runner'.) BR takes its future setting for granted, and instead spends its theatrical energy introducing you to the people who occupy the realm. BR 2049 looks good, but seems to be constantly reminding you 'this is the future! Look at all the cool gadgets.' And that sets you outside the story. Last note: the original Blade Runner has no villains. Everyone is caught up in the currents of their various situations. They're all doing what they think they need to do to survive. Rutger Hauer is a bad guy... until you really understand his back story. And there is a underlying tone of tragedy to all the violence. But BR 2049 features a psychotic villain who everybody wants to see die. There's no nuance to that character. There's no tragedy in any of the violence.In a weird way, BR 2049 is itself a 'replicant'. It looks like a Blade Runner film, even has a couple of the original characters nestled into the storyline... but it doesn't feel real. Not awful by any means but doesn't have anything like the creative fire necessary to bear the title 'Blade Runner'. It was enjoyable but ... 'unnecessary'; continued the story in a way that was complex and clumsy and not needed. The fate of the original characters was better left to the imagination.BR 2049 is like an elaborate fan-fiction that somehow manages to completely miss the point.",7,1,4,8 January 2018
It," Much love to the cast and filmmakers.
","I read IT on first release. I even remember where I was; away from home on business, staying in a small motel for a week. I'd gone to pick up some reading material and was pleased to find a new Stephen King novel. For three days all I did was work and come to my little room to be fascinated and freaked out by the master of fascinating freaky sh*t. The tension was enhanced by being in an unfamiliar environment. Only reading The Shining had been a more tense experience. All that to say I love this book! The only novel I've reread more is Tolkien's LOTR. And that's an appropriate association because I have always seen IT as more of fantasy than a horror. Sort of a fantasy/horror/adventure. So when I read the announcement, years ago, that it was being adapted to screen, I was ecstatic. I had been eagerly anticipating seeing it done correctly ever since that fiasco of a miniseries. Let's be honest. Curry was great but as for the rest of it...? Nuff sed. This new work is a wonderful adaptation done by people who obviously loved the book. Considering the breadth of King's labyrinthine novel, it's amazing Fukunaga and Mascetti managed to construct a smooth through story. Great writing. Excellent cinematography. As good as Curry was, Skarsgard creates a Pennywise much closer to the source material. He is truly frightening and unpredictable. And the kids. They close the deal. I love those brats. Even Henry Bowers. Their acting and comic timing brought the Losers Club to life. They were so good that I just forgot about all the stuff from the novel I had wanted to see but was left out. I even forgave the revision of giving Mike Hanlon's role to Ben, and all the shaky CG moments and other little complaints. These kids were not the same Losers that I read about in the book, but they claimed the roles so much that when I was watching I kept thinking, 'ah, so this is what they're like in real life'... haha. Much love to the cast and filmmakers. Can't wait for the directors cut DVD. This is a winner.",10,2,4,3 October 2017
Cloverfield," Big, fun, loud, adrenaline rush with 3 minor problems (spoilers)
","When I first saw the TV spots for this film I knew I was going to see it. I got the premise: Blair Witch meets Godzilla... or whatever the heck that was. Cool. It was worth staying up for the midnight showing and I had a good time. But I really had to work to get past a few strategic faults. Since this film requires the viewer engage their own imagination to be truly effective, any break in suspension of disbelief sort of kills the moment. I know this is Monday morning quarterbacking, but:Problem 1. Character Context. Why not make the protags a news crew on assignment or some kids doing an amateur shoot in the street when they get caught up in the attack. It would have made more sense than the going away party scenario and the camera handlers dedication to catching the action would have been more logical. It would have also provided an excuse for more concise narration. They could have still kept the romantic back story, just put it in the context of a film crew. And speaking of back story:Problem 2. Cumbersome Back Story. Like in Blair Witch this film requires the viewer to participate in the illusion and it can be much more engaging because of that. But when they have to keep developing the romantic back story it strains credulity. Their method was clever, the bits of erased tape etc... and in the conclusion of the film it provided an emotional note. But it was a bit overplayed, gave the protag a frantic Ahab tone, and some of the tension and illusion gets strained during their rescue mission and in it's IMO overplayed conclusion.Problem 3 The Pay Off Shot. One of the big complaints about Blair Witch is that there was no pay off shot, you never saw whatever was killing everybody. I understand the appeal of the final visual, but IMO that is the mistake here. The monster in your imagination is always worse than the one you see. So the initial chaotic shots we saw of the monster and it's creepy off spring.... or whatever they were... were perfect. Established it's horrific majesty and maintained the illusion that this was actually happening. But then they give the pay off shot right at the end. Bad move IMO. It diminished the beast in my eye and ruined the illusion of reality.But all that not withstanding, it was still a lot of fun. Major adrenaline. 8 for concept. 6 for execution. Make sure the theater has ample sub woofers for full effect.",6,1,5,19 January 2008
Watchmen," The best film that ever bored me.
","Impressive, intelligent, layered, rich in metaphor and subtext...and oddly boring. I don't know what it is about Watchmen. I never read the comic, so maybe that's why I didn't get it...? It should have been great for provoking after viewing conversation, but afterward I just didn't want to think about it. It starts great, but goes off kilter somehow, like a rhythm that goes out of sync 1/2 way into a song, and the further it goes the more obvious the off beats become. Then comes the point you just can't enjoy it anymore. But the concept was great. Amazingly clever play with hero archetypes, and the social and political statements suggested in the blurred distinctions of right and wrong. It's challenging in that regard, but dominated by a meandering sort of cerebral pomp, especially in Rorschach's Noir style monologues; and the white angst evoked in the 'Noble Lie' conclusion. The only stereotypes that remained intact were the bad guys, who could have been plucked from any generic superhero fantasy. For a film so complex it embraced some pretty 'central casting' social memes. Perhaps I am just taking it too seriously, but that's the way it was presented. And if a virtually omnipotent being like Dr Manhatten can't enjoy life... then why live? Friends have been recommending this for a long time. I finally got around to viewing it. It was impressive film and I really should have liked it, but... maybe it was just too long?",6,4,7,5 May 2012
Man of Steel," Too much, too soon, too loud.
","(SPOILERS) Not gong to spend a lot on time on this because the film has taken too much of my time already. Not so much the film itself but all the hype and his appearances in commercials for everything from razors to hamburgers. Jeez. The 1st hour is great. It could have been fleshed out and made into a feature of its own. In fact, I would have liked that better. But what we have here is 2.. or maybe 3 films packed into one. And I guess people are just used to it now but frankly all the over-the-top action was boring. I was ready to leave 20 minutes after Michael Shannon arrived. I was getting my butt kicked by subwoofers. I'll skip the narrative fallacies because who really cares, right? But what we have here isn't so much a superhero but a guy with super powers who is not sure what to do with them. I get the feeling Nolan and Snyder don't really like the character that much. Critics of the critics of MOS say that we're just clinging to the old version. Nah. This just isn't such a good film. So many new plot points are introduced in the second half it seems amateurish. Oh... so now they're going to terraform the planet. Quick explanation of how that came about and back to the fighting. Fail. And it's not really a revision of the character. It's the same guy with some essential elements missing. And I don't mean the pointless flap over his red panties.I mean his sense of purpose. It seems the iconic American superhero is not well suited for the age of cynicism. I liken it to the contemporizing of Tolkein's Stryder. In Jackson's film LOTR, he's played as a new age man, doubtful, conflicted, complex. But Aragorn of Arathron was never doubted his place in the world, or his mission. Likewise, Nolan's Superman is a repressed, conflicted man who is almost forced into becoming the hero he was destined to be. Gone is the unflinching defender of truth and justice and instead we have a guy who is really really strong, and helps out the human race once in a while. And about the human race... we're like peripheral in this whole thing. I mean, how many people died when Superman attacked Zod for punching his mother? That little wrestling match must have taken out 30 or 40 at least. We're stick figures. At least to the writers. Perry White little adventure in the wreckage is pointless because he, like most of the characters haven't had enough screen time to generate any sympathy. Hundreds of thousands have just been slaughtered, but omg will these three make it? Ahhh, I spent enough time on this already. I was really looking forward to this, especially afer Nolan;'s work on the Dark Knight series. MOS wasn't awful but nowhere near the hype. Weak writing. Cheap shortcuts. Pointlessly noisy. No respect for the source or the audience. Not angry, just disappointed. It should have been 2 films.",4,2,5,15 June 2013
28 Weeks Later," 28 Bucks Later... and I could have waited for the DVD (lite spoilers)
","After seeing '28 Days Later' on DVD and wishing I'd seen it in theaters, I wanted to make sure to catch the sequel '28 Weeks Later' on the big screen. Bad call. I should have heeded the golden rule about sequels. They generally suck. To be fair I am not going to claim that this film sucks, or that it is not worth seeing. But at matinée prices of 9 bucks a head for three of us, (+ gas and overpriced popcorn and cokes) we could have seen something that didn't just tick us off. And I don't know how anyone who loved the originality and cleverness of the first film, couldn't be ticked off. Gone is the loose indie feel and haunting quality of the first film. In it's place is a hi-pro-glow shoot-em-up with over-played MTV style low-attention-span action sequences that go on and on long past the point of generating any excitement, and leave us only confused as to what the hell is actually happening. Gone is the clever subtext from the first film contrasting the infected and the militarist mindset of the soldiers in the keep. Instead we have an attempt to only create a non-stop adrenaline rush, volume full-blast from the resurgence of the infection until the very end. How to take something unique and make it typical. IMHO, not an awful film, but I could have waited the DVD... in order to skip past the stupid bits.",5,1,4,16 May 2007
I Am Legend," I Am Pabulum: Fresh Prince Of The Apocalypse (spoilers)
","Watch the first 20 minutes of this film carefully, because that's pretty much as good as it gets. Then you can go rent The Omega Man. It's a 36-year-old version of the same story, is laced with pretentious and vaguely right-wing undercurrents and cheesy effects, yet it's still a better film even with Charlton Heston as the protagonist.The shame is that Will Smith really can act. Hey, I saw Ali, I know it can happen. But, if not for the obvious elements of the story, one would not know that his character lives in desperate solitude that borders on suicidal. Even his talking with mannequins or his dog comes off as quirky instead of the desperate attempt to cling to reality that it is. This inability to exemplify the desperation that is lurking just beneath the surface of Smith's obsessive dedication to duty, really ruins his character arc when, later in the film, he goes on a suicidal revenge quest. It makes no sense because there's been no emotional build up outside of the simply utilitarian dialogue and memory flashes.But it's not all Smith's fault. Someone needs to yank the CG toys away from filmmakers, or at least convince them that big names, digital trickery and pop culture pandering cannot replace a good script.I had temporary resurgence of hope when Smith was rescued from his failed suicide attempt. For just a moment it seemed that his rescuer had a hair lip or some imperfection that might wipe off the layer of superficiality that coated the film. But she turned out to be a vapidly beautiful woman with a vapidly charming young boy in tow, and she and Smith engaged in some equally vapid exchanges wherein we find that God has been talking to her. Ummm. anyway then comes time for the attack of the CG monsters and the film gets loud and brash and pretty pointless.To be fair the action is OK, if rather predictable, and there are some great creepy moments, especially when Smith is navigating dark rooms filled with the infected. But IMO these moments get overshadowed by the over-doctored script, over digitized effects and the thematic pallor of the film. Omega Man at least engages the intellect with some philosophical arguments, as academic as they might be. 'Legend' tries to make up for this lack of substance with innuendo, by Smith's love for Bob Marley. But even that comes off as pandering as opposed to making a subtle point.I will admit it was absolutely amazing how they created an abandoned New York City. But I think 28 Days Later (a much better film made with a much smaller budget) stole their fire on that one.If you're looking for a big budget escapist FX romp, go for it. It'll satisfy. But if you're seeking a good sci-fi film with subtext, intelligence and respect for the source material, as well as its audience, I'd keep looking.And, please, someone hide the good books from Hollywood, before they film one again.",5,7,11,26 December 2007
The King," A good film but a bit 'over-brooded'.
","(lite spoilers) The King has everything required in a great film. Compelling characters excellently portrayed. Great script. Gritty realism in sets and costume. Subtlety in plot and dialogue. I really loved the period language. But ... for some reason it just never really got there for me. I can't speak to historical accuracy for I don't know the history. There are elements and segments that really stand out, but overall it has a brooding quality that felt overdone. It never seems to get out of the gray. There's a portentous weight on everything that never wants to let you breathe. They didn't really need the constant score. There are many scenes that would have played better on their own without the incessant tonal atmospherics. I think performances were strong enough without having to force the scene with bg music. The battle was a powerful series of scenes but I think GoT stole some of that thunder with Battle Of The Bastards.",6,1,4,5 November 2019
Mystic River," Mystic Trickle
","Excellent cast and performances, wonderful directing... too bad they didn't have a story to tell. And it's not because there was no happy ending, I don't need the hero to get a touchdown or the happy puppy licking the face, but I do want resolution and that is one thing this film does not offer. Was it supposed to make me think? Well it did... I am still wondering what it was supposed to be about. I love Sean Penn, his acting and his politics. Tim Robbins is one of the highest on my American heroes list, but I just don't get this one. And Larry Fishburne... what can I say, he's the man. All of them gave stellar performances, but the film moves into a pretense of shifting character relationships in the conclusion and whatever point it was trying to make was mired in unresolved innuendo. A lot of effort and talent went into a film that IMO evoporates into an insubstancial trickle.",Null,0,0,9 January 2004
War of the Worlds," War of the Plots (missed opportunity and faux tension)
","WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!I knew there was something wrong when I saw the first TV spot for this film. I felt like Dakota Fanning's character must have felt in a scene from the film when strange lightening was flashing from the sky. She knew something wasn't right, but Cruise, her irresponsible father, assured her that it was just lightening, only to realize, too late, that something was wrong. I knew something wasn't right when I saw that the entirety of the ad campaign was resting on the shoulders of Cruise and Fanning when there should have been a host of names. But my irresponsible common sense kept assuring me that it was Spielberg and nothing could go wrong.What went wrong was, I have come to believe, Tom Cruise. Or more appropriately, a bloated sub-plot wound around a superstar that eclipses the rest of the story. Much like Anthony Hopkins sucked the tension from 'Red Dragon' or Jim Carey killed 'Lemony Snickets', by drawing too much attention to themselves and away from a story which could stand better on its own merits.Cruise guarantees big box office and I even find him enjoyable at times, like in 'Interview With The Vampire' 'Magnolia' and 'Born on Forth Of July'. Dakota Fanning has carried her weight alongside such stars as Sean Penn, Denzel Washington and Rob Dinero She was great in 'Taken' and 'I Am Sam'. She is adorable and talented and eerily precocious in interviews; a sophisticated, female version of Haley Joel Osment. So both Cruise and Fanning are up to the task of carrying the film. The problem is, they shouldn't be carrying the film. 'War Of The Worlds' is a panoramic story, an epic based on a radio story that was the first of its kind, its own genre'. It should encompass the entirety of the story of Martians attacking our planet. Instead Spielberg,perhaps resting on the draw of his two Superstars, chooses to focus the story almost entirely on the family conflicts between a negligent father and his two estranged children. This is just one among many subplots that could have been explored and by focusing entirely on this, the magnitude of the story is lost. It's bad enough (and perhaps xenophobic in our troubled world) to focus on the crisis of one country in a story like this, let alone the internal disputes of just one dysfunctional family. One of the obviously missing elements (and opportunities) was a stable to the sci-fi genre' and the film suffers for its absence, and that is the second-guessing scientist (nerd or uberman depending on the era) whose inexplicably accurate expositional monologues explain what is going on in-between scenes of rampant carnage. In an intriguing twist the attack comes not from the skies, as in the original, but underground. Strangely Spielberg depends on a distraught weekend-warrior type character, played by Tim Robbins, to suggest that the Martians must have been hiding there for centuries, since before man, and leave me wondering why the hell would he thrust this rather impractical plot idea into the middle of a scene and just leave it hanging there. Also missing is the harried gruff General, who drops his head to signify that all is lost for mankind. Instead we see brief moments of foot soldiers getting their collective butts trounced or waving for lines of ragged civilians to move it along. Perhaps Spielberg wanted to avoid those genre' devices and focus on the dramatic elements, but he could have used more than one group of people. And this approach is worse than just insufficient to capture the breadth of the story; it also ruins the tension. I've only seen it once (enough, really), but I know of at least two scenes when characters are woken from sleep, (FROM SLEEP?) by either explosions or aliens or alien probes. Why are they sleeping? I mean, I can assume they have to sleep, but do we really have to watch them? The world is under attack and he opens a scene with characters being woken from sleep to create tension? This pacing for this film should have been frenetic, there should not have been a moment to rest. There is also the faux tension, generated in numerous scenes but exemplified best, when Cruise and Fanning are trapped in the basement of a crumbled house (an obvious ode to the original film) and waste screen time with slipping from one part of the set to another in a predictable slamming door farce (sans doors), while hiding from an alien probe. In the original film this was given a minute or so to unfold, but Spielberg ups the ante and kills the tension by dragging the whole scenario on way past the time when you were actually worried that something bad might happen. He does this too in the build up to any climatic moment, holding the moment way past the point it was necessary to create tension, as if there was nothing better to do with the story and he had to kill a little time in-between arguments between Cruise and his son (played rather stiffly by Justin Chatwin).I am not a Spielberg basher. Many of his films are on my shelf: E.T, Schindlers List, Close Encounters, Catch Me If You Can, Color Purple, AI (ignore the naysayers on this last one, most of them mistook the Supermecha for aliens). But something went really wrong here. Maybe it is when he works with Cruise, because I had the same feeling about Minority Report. In spite of what my rant may imply, I didn't hate the film. There were really effective moments, scary and thrilling too. I wasn't completely disappointed, just disappointed enough. Hell, I might even see it again. But only if friends insist on going and only if they buy the popcorn.",5,1,3,1 July 2005
Joker," I have got to start ignoring the hoopla about 'controversial' films.
","Just watched 'Joker' and I realized I have got to start ignoring criticisms around 'controversial' films. Like Jojo Rabbit, Joker was getting criticized for things that have nothing to do with what is on the screen. I was hesitant about it because after some reviews I imagined it would be full of the moral relativism that imo, tainted Zac Snyder's 'Watchmen', (and which HBO recently corrected.) But Joker is magnificent. What some were calling nihilism, I saw as a warning. Like the 'joke' Phoenix tells DiNero before a critical moment: 'What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash?'... What you deserve.'. That single line encapsulates the fundamental theme of the film. Wonderfully acted and directed. Dark, yes, very dark... and unrelenting about that. But it's beautifully subversive. Not nihilistic. There's a difference. I think it's on par with V For Vendetta in that regard. Sort of V meets Travis Bickle. It's a great continuation of the trend of deconstruction of superhero archetypes. I particularly loved the re-framing of Thomas Wayne from the comic's heroic billionaire philanthropist, into a Bloomberg-esque entitled mayoral wanna-be with a mouth full of the standard trickle-down nonsense. And I must admit Joaquin Phoenix truly does deserve best lead actor. He is truly captivating and frightening. The direction, editing, superb. The ironic use of music didn't come off as trite or manipulative as, imo, it did in Scorsese, Irishman. To be honest, I am still biased towards 'Jojo Rabbit' for best picture. That film is closer to my heart. But Joker is a powerful piece of work, and I won't see it as a crime if it wins. (If Once Upon A Time in Hollywood or The Irishman take the trophy, I would see that as a rip off because both are overrated, imo. Good, meticulous and all that... but overrated.)",9,3,4,1 January 2020
August Rush," August Rut (Avoid if you liked this film!)
","August Rush is one of those feel good films that will cause any critic to be bum-rushed with accusations of pretentiousness and/or the malicious desire to ruin the magic. I can assure you that while I may accurately be accused of putting on the occasional air (well, not so occasional perhaps) it is not any inherent malice that inspired this criticism. Rather, it was revenge, completely futile and irrelevant revenge. Not only on the people who took what might have been a truly magical film and turned it instead into a Hallmark Channel meets MTV event with a PTL innuendo thrown in just to tick me off a little more; but also revenge on the people who gave it more than the 4 or 5 stars it deserves, because I actually based my decision to go see it on your ratings. YOU OWE ME! OK. Some time has passed and I can admit the preceding was hyperbolic. When I wrote it I had just got back from the theater and the score was still ringing in my ears. It's not really that bad just bad enough, and nothing ticks me off more than an OK film that could have been great. There are parts that I will admit are are very well done and a scattering of clever lines break through the fog of pallid dialog. But these sparkling moments fizzle out under the overbearing (and occasionally trite) incidental score, and the over-doctored script.The feature songs, the central theme of the film, are actually cool for the most part. The guitar work is brilliant, and the rest is consuming and even inspiring when it is not sounding like corporate extract of alternative rock.Robin Williams' character, though not given sufficient time to develop, was surprisingly complex, especially considering the three-chord repetition of the others. Like Jonathan Rhys Meyers for example, a 'rocker' (or something) who spews portentous gibberish when he is not running around the film looking pensive and conflicted and emoting like a teenage girl. Or Keri Russell who is pretty and blond and apparently not much else except for a few good lines here and there.Freddie Highmore might be a good actor, I don't really know because most of his parts are just K-Pax/Rain Man idiot-savant type staring into the distance before he learns how to play guitar or piano in a matter of minutes. But I really can't blame him for the failure of the script. I generally give kids the benefit of the doubt.What is most frustrating is that there are occasional moments of  well, I wouldn't say brilliance, but definitely good writing. But it gets stomped out of existence by the next hackneyed moment or drowned in the films manipulative attempts to shove it's message down our collective throats.Note to filmmakers: You don't have to beat the audience over the head with your message. Let the play say the thing.",5,5,7,24 July 2008
It Chapter Two," I really liked it. I could have loved it.
","(SPOILERS) It chapter 2 is a sort of glorious mess of best intentions. But I think its weaknesses can be attributed to one simple thing: the success of Chapter 1. The kids in the first film had a natural, unforced charmed. We all knew them, they reminded us of ourselves, our friends, the brats next door. But the adults in this film are not really given time to establish themselves in our hearts, we only see them as adult versions of the kids. It's not that way in the novel. The adult/children version are separate but equally defined. This second film also seems to constantly be trying to replicate the tone and innocent vulgarity of the first film. But it's not the first film , and shouldn't have tried to be. Chapter 1 tells a very simple story, kids form friendship and fight shape-shifting demon from another dimension. We meet the kids, see their first encounters with IT, explore the insecurities they have to overcome, then on to the show down. Even at its foundation, Chapter 2 is a much more complicated tale. Old friends, who have forgotten shape-shifting demon, get called back to fight it, must renew old bonds, be reminded of what IT is, revisit encounters in several flashbacks, be introduced to ancient ritual etc etc... All that to say it could never have been a continuation of Chapter 1. It was essentially a different film. But in trying to match the pacing and tone of the first they cheated the adult cast, and imo, the audience, of a more adult film. ... A dead giveaway to the insecurity of this film is the non-stop score. Whenever filmmakers are unsure of a scenes ability to carry impact, they blast the score. From the moment the adult Losers enter the Niebolt house, the music keeps trying to force the atmosphere. This actually deadens the dynamics of those sections and ruins the scares because the best scares are born in silence. There are so many scenes when they could have just let silence carry the tension and let the play say the thing. Also, and I know people will disagree, there was too much Pennywise in the conclusion. I get why they did that, with the clown spider thing, but as a fan of the novel, I was just hoping to see something more surreal and incomprehensible. Something horrible. Overall it was OK. I enjoyed IT chapter 2. But I could have loved it if it had not been constantly begging to be loved. Knowing this was cut down from 4 hours, provides me hope that the expanded version be able to take it's time and let the adults Losers establish themselves.",7,4,7,6 September 2019
The Wrestler," Gratitude for a classic
","This film doesn't really need any kudos from me since anyone who sees it will recognize it is destined to be a classic. But I was moved enough to add my own little BRAVO! and heartfelt gratitude to Mr. Rourke for a FLAWLESS performance, as well as Ms Tomei and Misters Aronosky and Siegal ... Mr Springsteen... hell, just everyone from the top down to the guy who cleaned the honey wagon! Thank you! This is what films are about, great performances and stories. No digital nonsense. No obtuse revelation at the end. I am reminded of 12 Angry Men, The War At Home, powerful dramas driven by powerful performances. Maybe I am gushing, but it's so wonderful to go to the theater and have such a satisfying viewing experience. There were two small moments when the pacing seemed off, and the expertly achieved documentary feel was compromised by what seemed a rushed bit of plot development: once when we meet Rourke's daughter for the first time and next when his Doctor gives him the bad news. And I thought the last encounter between Rourke and Tomei added an off note of predictability to the conclusion. But otherwise I think this was as close to perfection as I have seen. I am reminded of Taxi Driver for some reason. Not in content, but in the seamless construction of the film. One unexpected result of The Wrestler, for me anyway, was a new respect for pro wrestlers. Not that I am likely to become a fan, but in my dismissal of the field as phony, I have apparently neglected to recognize the artistry involved. There are many films I've yet to see this year, and there will surely be serious contenders for best actor, but I have a strong feeling Mickey Rourke's performance will take them all down for the count.",9,2,2,14 January 2009
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," The Battle Of The CG Armies.(All good things must pass, hopefully before they become bad things.)
","Technically I cannot call myself a nerd, though my good friends are. I guess I am 'nerd adjacent', to paraphrase Hal Sparks. And I use 'nerd' in the most respectful sense. I was a Tolkien fan, had read LOTR more than once and of course the Hobbit. But my friends were sci- fi/fantasy fanatics. Knew all the kings of the realms and the histories and actually read the Silmarillion, which I thought was a freekin snoozefest. Decades before the first LOTR film came out, we used to sit around and hypothesize how it could be made while we were playing D&D. What would the Black Riders look like? Rivendell? Would they screw up and show Sauron? Would Bombadil be cut again, like in all the radio adaptations? Who should play what part etc... Our biggest fear was that someone would create another Ralph Bakshi nightmare. So when Jackson finally made it happen it was like a dream come true. Midnight shows on opening night became a household tradition. The stories and characters were truncated and contemporized and most of the plot changes and omissions were understandable. Overall it was a magnificent experience. Someone actually did Lord Of The Rings, and they did it justice!.... Then came the Hobbit, which started off very nicely. But it but quickly turned into a weird sort of LOTR knock off. The music, the tone, the scene cadence... it was all the same. The best parts of the Hobbit series are where they honor the lore and tone of Tolkien; those quiet moments of character and plot development in between all the over-the-freekin-top fight sequences. IMO, the action instincts which served Jackson so well in the LOTR series, detracted from this film. But I understand that after such a huge win, he really couldn't change the formula. I guess he got trapped by his own success. Of course there are unforgettable moments, Smaug being the high point. I mean a talking dragon could have failed, like a talking tree. But Jackson made both work. But with a few notable exceptions, imo, Five Armies is just more of the same. The best moments are dramatic and character driven, while 'The Battle of the CG Armies' gets tedious and predictable. They even use the same music crescendo for every climactic buildup. Like they cut and pasted all Shore's bits from the other films. And the dialogue was barely a step above exposition. It was almost like they were tired of it all too, and just wanted to get the damn thing into the theater so they could get to work on something else. Not to mention the fumbling last minute segues into the Fellowship. They could have just left that out. It was goofy and defied the story logic of LOTR. Whatever. I loved the books, of course. I loved the LOTR films. Have all the extended versions and we still watch 'em occasionally. But The Hobbit series was like listening to Yngwie Malmsteen. Sure he's awesome.... but didn't he just do all those riffs on the last two albums? In conclusion, LOTR series, absolutely! Magnificent. But the Hobbit... Good. For the most part..... But I'm just glad it's all finally over.... I hope.",5,2,6,26 December 2014
Inception," Action, drama AND intelligence? I must be dreaming.
","Still riding at 9 stars after over 65k votes (as of this writing) Inception doesn't really need my 2 cents. But I simply have to write something because it was so good I couldn't believe I was sitting in an AMC theater. Considering the menu lately, tepid remakes, sequels of sequels and mindless action flicks, (not to mention the unforgivable fiasco of The Last Airhead )I was about to swear off the big movie houses completely and spend my money at the small independent theaters. There, if not thoroughly entertained, at least I won't be treated like an idiot. But Inception has given me hope.Nolan has created a major release film that not only entertains but engages on all levels, especially the one so many mainstream films tend to overlook: the mind. There is adequate exposition here, (too much in some cases IMO) but still you have to pay attention and remember what you are seeing.My only complaint was that I thought the dream realm might have been a bit more abstract, especially in the deeper regions of the subconscious. But I am so happy to have my mind stimulated by a major release that I will just toss that little gripe in the trash can.No need for a long review here, there are already plenty and done a lot better than I would. I just want to say, see this film! A thought provoking story with no lack of action and wit, it's awesome entertainment and great for after-viewing conversation.... and for a change we had something to talk about besides how we might have better spent our money. I must be dreaming.",9,3,5,25 July 2010
Prometheus," Shiny and vapid. MST3K material.
","Prometheus is a glossy CG driven farce of 'neo'generic and comically idiotic characters, magic technology, predictable plot points, hackneyed dialog (made all the more insufferable by a pretentious innuendo of depth), absurd and superfluous action scenes and a non-stop score that is as trite as ineffective. Seriously, I don't even know what to say to express how freekin bad this is. And Ridley Scott? Are you serious? See, I just didn't believe the man who started the 'Alien' franchise with that innovative and exciting first film, could return to produce something awful. And that's why I went. Many years ago after some other big budget industry insult, I had vowed to never see a film on opening weekend; but to wait for word of mouth from people I trust. But this time I figured, 'Hey, it's Ridley Scott. What could go wrong?' Prometheus. That's what went wrong. And I love escapist romps, man. That why I went. But, omg... what a stinker. It's not even funny. I am genuinely p*ssed. P*ssed that Scott could create such horrendous pap and p*ssed that anyone could sit through it and give it a positive rating. How? It's beyond me. This film deserves to fail. After all that hype, it's a freekin insult. Be warned. There is something evil in the universe. And it's playing at a theater near you. Stay away, for the sake of humanity.Addendum: I wanted to add that if this had been just another AVP type knock off, it wouldn't have made me angry because I would have expected porridge and just waited for the DVD. Like I said, I enjoy mindless fun now and then. But this was made by Ridley Scott and that is the only reason I went to the theater. And that is the reason for the low rating and the anger. Big let down, Mr Scott.",3,5,10,10 June 2012
Jojo Rabbit," Just go see it.
","I heard someone say not to watch trailers about Jojo Rabbit. And I agree with that. Because the trailers do not... CANNOT... do it justice. And no matter what anyone says about it; ; no matter how they try to explain the story or convey how good it is... they're also not doing it justice. Even Taika Waititi couldn't explain what his own film accomplishes. Satire... comedy... none of those words are sufficient. It's something you have to see for yourself, and better with fellow film goers. So just go see it..... go on.... time's a'wastin.... why are you still sitting there?",10,2,6,21 November 2019
Cloud Atlas," A labyrinthine and magnificent spectacle! Bravo! Bravo!
","Just got back and already want to see it again. It is already clear that this film will provide many more hours of enjoyment just trying to tie it all together. It is also clear that it is destined for a place among the nobles of cinematic history. Bravo does not suffice. I'll leave the reviews up to the pros, but for my humble part let me just say Cloud Atlas is a labyrinthine and magnificent spectacle, adventurous, humorous, ingenious, layered, insightful and moving. Very moving. But be warned: take care of nature's call before you sit down. You can't afford to miss a moment. And forgo the popcorn. You'll be too busy following the story to eat it.",10,11,20,28 October 2012
