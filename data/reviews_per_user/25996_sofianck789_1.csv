Men in Black 3," Agent Jay goes on a mission to save the world once more.
","The Men in Black, one of the most timeless movies in science fiction, has returned. Now more than ever it has come with an inexplicably assorted cast of Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin, and Emma Thompson in futuristic garb, fighting for earth once more. The trilogy dates back to 1997 with original characters Agent Jay (Will Smith) and Agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) defending mankind from extraterrestrial forces, under the cloak of black Ray Bans, humor, and an excessive amount of artillery. In this conclusion of the Men in Black trilogy, Agent Jay gets caught in a web of events and secrets that leads him to time jump (quite literally) to 1969 to try and kill a grotesque Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement)—whose overwhelmingly unpleasant face could easily dole out nightmares—and save the earth once more from alien invasion. Within the first ten minutes, as well as throughout the movie, you can see the amount of special effects, laughs, chemistry of actors, and imagination engineered to make this movie live up to its legendary expectations. The most entertaining parts of the movie, however, were skin-deep (in this case probably horrendous, multi-colored alien skin): costume and makeup. Men in Black has had an impermeable reputation for creating some of the most odd and horrifying creatures in the past and third movie has only highlighted this, upstaging its predecessors. From Boris the Animal's monster-like complexion, the 'gold fish from the bags at the school fair' at Mr. Wu's, and the jellyfish-blimp creatures topping off the skyscrapers of New York City for dessert, it looks as though all extra firearms will be put to good use. Costumes were also of good taste when Agent Jay rolls onto the streets of 1969 New York with hippies strolling around, with funny references to racism and famous people like Andy Warhol throughout. And what better context to set all of this in than the wide cityscape of New York City, a jail on the moon, and space? Use of all these familiar monuments (ex. Empire State building) and secret government organizations almost made me question the existence of aliens. Almost. The background music of the movie, with never-ending variations of the theme song, only made the mood more reminiscent of a James Bond high speed chase: sleek and intriguing with the occasional, disturbing alien voice. Another intriguing aspect was the use of camera angles, especially when Agent Jay leaps off of the Empire State building. All in all, seeing this movie made me feel like my seven-year- old self, in awe of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones for having excellent chemistry on screen and making me laugh almost every ten minutes. The whole movie was quite an experience—one definitely more enjoyable behind a pair of 3D glasses—although the romance between Agent K and Agent O seemed added in for the more mainstream viewers and mostly unnecessary. Appealing to most audiences, I believe Men in Black III deserves a wholesome seven stars for humor, special effects, acting, theme music/mood and an interesting use of Agent Kay doubles (who looked surprisingly similar to one another). Usually reluctant to watching most movie sequels, I was pleasantly surprised and found the third and last Men in Black is now my favorite and will recommend it to as many people as possible who enjoy a good laugh and plenty of alien guts.",7,2,4,7 June 2012
