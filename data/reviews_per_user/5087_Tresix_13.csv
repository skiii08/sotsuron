Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Worth the wait.
","Like many other STAR WARS fans, I had sixteen years of anticipation building up within me when I heard that George Lucas was going to finally bring the next (or, in this case, previous) chapters of the saga of the Skywalker family, their friends and foes.  I have to say that EPISODE I was a good film.  GOOD, but not great. The special effects this time were awesome, especially considering that the ones in the first film were done without any computer-generated images and in fact puts many of those to shame.  The effects in EPISODE I really stand out, particularly in the way that the live-action actors interact with their computer-generated 'co-stars'.  The story is quite good as we now know the relationships between some characters that were shown in the original trilogy.  I didn't find the character of Jar Jar Binks to be a racial stereotype in anyway.  Many people have compared him to Stepin Fetchit, this couldn't be further form the truth.  If anything, Jar Jar recalls some of the clowns from the silent film era.  However, I will say that a little bit of Binks DOES go a long way. Now, for the negative things:  I thought that some of the dialogue went on WAY too long.  Whatever happened to 'show . . . don't tell'?  For all of the build-up given new villain, Darth Maul, he had very little screen time as well as dialogue.  I was also surprised to see that two of the new characters, and the most interesting ones at that, get killed here (You'll have to see the movie to find out which two.  Sorry!).  After this, all I've got to say is:  Bring on EPISODE II!",9,0,0,20 May 1999
Casablanca," THE Standard
","I can honestly say I know what makes a good movie because I have a standard by which to compare it:  CASABLANCA.  Adapted from a play entitled 'Everyone Comes to Rick's', CASABLANCA tells the story of American Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart in the role that made his legend), a cynical saloon owner. His motto:  'I stick my neck out for nobody.  I'M the only cause worth fighting for.'  We learn that, in the past, Rick was once an idealistic man who would fight the good fight for just causes.  As his 'friend' Louie (Claude Rains) reminds him as he ticks off the underdog causes that Rick has championed 'The winning side would have paid MUCH more.'  Just when we are convinced that Rick truly is an insular hard-case . . . into his life returns Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), the woman who killed the idealism in him.  She is on the arm of freedom fighter Victor Laslo (Paul Heinreid). The sight of Ilsa sparks a flashback that shows Rick, Ilsa and Rick's piano-playing friend Sam (Dooley Wilson) in Paris before the arrival of the Nazis.  As Rick and Sam wait for Ilsa, she sends him a note at the train station saying that she can never see him again.  That is, until their paths cross again in Casablanca.  To add to the stress, the Nazis, led by the pinch-faced Major Strasser (Conrad Veidt), decide to march into Casablanca as well.  Their intent:  To capture Laslo and prevent him from stirring up strength against the Nazis on the other side of the world. CASABLANCA benefits greatly from a dynamite script, great directing and, for once, the perfect union of casting and character.  By now, most people know how the film ends.  This is even more impressive since the ending to the film was being written even as the cameras began rolling to shoot it.  Two endings had been written, but when the producers saw the ending that was shot (the one used in the film), they saw no need to shoot the other ending.  Needless to say, CASABLANCA is a part of my film library. If it's not in your's, you're only depriving yourself.",10,1,1,29 September 2000
Chinatown," As close to perfection as you can come.
","With the possible exception of CASABLANCA, this my all-time favorite movie. I am a big fan of the genre (Phillip Marlowe, Sam Spade . . . you get the idea).  Jake Gittes is a really great character and I couldn't imagine anyone else BUT Jack Nicholson playing him.  In fact, I couldn't imagine anyone else in the whole cast as their characters (including Polanski). CHINATOWN can hold its own along with such classics as THE BIG SLEEP, FAREWELL MY LOVELY (or MURDER MY SWEET) and THE MALTESE FALCON. I remember reading that writer Towne and director Polanski fought over the ending.  I'd have to say that Polanski, though still reeling from the murder of wife Sharon Tate, had the right idea.  I could not imagine this film having a happy ending.  It certainly wouldn't have been as memorable. I was surprised that John Huston wasn't nominated for an Oscar for his performance as evil incarnate. Noah Cross is truly one of the cinema's greatest villains.  As much as I like Art Carney, there is no way he should have won the Best Actor Oscar over Nicholson's work here.  At least the screenplay deservedly won.  Forget it, Jake . . .",10,2,3,24 November 1999
Underworld," Outmatrixes THE MATRIX
","When I saw the trailer for this movie, the first thing that ran through my mind: 'THE MATRIX with fangs'.  Leather trenchcoats, large-caliber automaticfirearms, wirework fight scenes.   I received a pass for an advance screening and went, not expecting too much.  I must say, after seeing the movie, I waspleasantly surprised.  UNDERWORLD was everything that THE MATRIXWISHES it could have been.    The movie basically continues a feud that wasshown in the movie THE HOWLING VI:  THE FREAKS:  vampires andwerewolves do not get along.  They have been warring for over a millennium. Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is a vampire known as a 'death dealer', sheespecially trained to kill lycans:  Werewolves.  The leader of the lycans, Lucian (Michael Sheen), has been killed. Or so we are led to believe.   It turns out that not only is he alive, but he is tracking a young man (Scott Speedman) who is a descendant of a man who is supposed to have the blood of both lycans andvampires flowing through him.  Selene  is also trying to get to Michael(Speedman) before Lucian.  As fate would have it, Michael is being hunted ataround the same time that  Viktor (Bill Nighy), the leader of the vampires, is going to be resurrected.    This isn't sitting too well with Kraven (Shane Brolly), the current leader.  He'd just as soon kill Michael as try to find out the plans that Lucian have for him.       The fight scenes are pretty impressive as is the unique ammo that each side uses to exploit the other's weaknesses such as bullets that emit ultraviolet rays inside of a vampire's body and others that are loaded with silver nitrate to get into a lycan's bloodstream quicker.    I repeat, I was expecting a weak MATRIX clone and  instead found a movie that, I think, sets the  bar high for THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS to top.",8,0,1,16 September 2003
Batman Returns," A little too Dark Knight
","I liked this movie, but I feel that some of it might be a little too dark in tone.  Especially for the young filmgoers that they were trying to target. Keaton does a good enough job as Batman and, this time, he is given adequate time as Bruce Wayne as well.  Danny DeVito made an exceptional Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer was superslinky as Catwoman.  I felt we could have done without Christopher Walken's Max Schreck.  The character is weak and not given enough motivation for doing the things that he does.  And we're just supposed to accept that the Penguin has the blueprints to the Batmobile in order to sabotage it!  Now THIS needed an explanation.  Not as much fun as the '89 film, but enjoyable nevertheless.",8,0,0,15 June 1999
The Shining," So much time, not enough scares
","What a combination!  The legendary Stanley Kubrick adapting a Stephen King novel and starring Jack Nicholson.  It couldn't miss . . . and yet it did!  The problems I had with this version of the story is that I think that Jack Torrance (Nicholson) isn't wrapped to tightly at the beginning of the film in the first place, so we don't exactly have that much tension when Jack finally does snap.  While I haven't read the King novel, I've heard that Wendy (Shelley Duvall) was no where near as wimpy as she is portrayed here.   I was also more annoyed by Danny (Danny Lloyd) than frightened or sympathetic towards him.  I probably would have taken an axe to him as well. On the plus side, I DID like Scatman Crothers' performance as the cook who can also 'shine'.  I also liked the use of sound, such as when Danny is riding his Big Wheel alone through the halls of the hotel.  The sound of the cycle going from the carpet to the wooden floor and back was a little unsettling.  Also the appearance of the twin ghosts was a bit of jolt as well.  However, I think the main complaint I have is that for the amount of time this movie runs, there aren't nearly enough scares to occupy them. That's why I'm about to commit a blasphemy:  I'm going to recommend the '97 TV version of this over this one!  THAT one scared me.",3,0,4,2 November 1999
Spider-Man," Caught in its web of entertainment.
","Fans of Spider-Man had been waiting for the webslinger to hit the big screen since 1985 when Cannon Films (the people responsible for MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE and SUPERMAN IV:  THE QUEST FOR PEACE) had the movie rights tot he character.  Then it looked as if 21ST Century Films (who gave us that truly awful adaptation of CAPTAIN AMERICA (1990) would make the movie.  Now, after all of the legal battles have been settled, SPIDER-MAN has finally hit the movies.  I'll confess, I'm more of a DC Comics fan, Batman in particular. But, hey, any film based off of a comic book superhero can only be a good thing, right?  And SPIDER-MAN IS a good thing. Even the most casual comic fan will know the story:  young Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is an orphaned high school student who is pushed around by practically everyone.  For years, he has had a crush on Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), the girl next door.  One day, on a school field trip, Parker is bitten by a genetically-altered (as opposed to radiation like in the comics) spider.  As a result, he begins to go through some SERIOUS changes:  His eyesight is improved where he no longer needs glasses, his physique is now buffed beyond belief, he has phenomenal strength and agility and can stick to walls and ceilings.  But there is the most important change:  he now can shoot webs from his wrists (unlike the mechanical webshooters from the comics).  I suppose they had to make the webbing come from his arms as opposed to where a spider's web REALLY comes from (let's just say it's why you see spiders hanging upside down when they dangle from the thread), it would be too embarrassing otherwise. At first, Parker tries to use his powers to become a pro wrestler (he squares off against none other than Randy 'Macho Man' Savage), until those fateful events:  A robbery that Parker could have stopped.  The escaped crook pulls a carjacking, of whom the victim happens to be his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), who had earlier tried to tell Peter 'With great power also comes great responsibility'.  When Peter realizes that the man who killed his uncle is the same one he could have stopped earlier, that is when he decides to become a superhero.  Sam Raimi directs with an understated flair that isn't quite as over-the-top as his style on the EVIL DEAD movies, but you will still have a good time. The villainy of SPIDER-MAN is provided by businessman Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) who, after experimenting with equipment that was supposed to go to the military, goes insane and ends up becoming the Green Goblin. Dafoe's laugh rivals that of Jack Nicholson's Joker in BATMAN.  In fact, there are some scenes here that will remind you of Tim Burton's 1989 blockbuster (The parade with balloons, the hero and villain fighting over the heroine in a dilapidated, abandoned building in darkness) as well as the 1978 SUPERMAN (Parker running down the street, ripping open his shirt to reveal his costume underneath), especially in the scenes set at the Daily Bugle, the newspaper run by the ever-cranky J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) that will recall Perry White and the Daily Planet in the earlier movie. Also on hand are Sam Raimi regulars Bruce Campbell (as the wrestling ring announcer) and his younger brother Tim (as one of Jameson's assistants).  Needless to say, the movie ends with the possibility of a sequel, which probably would have materialized even if the movie didn't become the hit that everyone is predicting that it will be.  After all, with the probable exceptions of Batman and the Flash, Spider-Man has the most interesting and recognizable rogue's gallery of any superhero.  From the multi-armed Doctor Octopus, the ever-shifting Sandman or Spider-Man's evil doppleganger Venom (and his 'offspring' Carnage), there are no ending to sequel tales.  Of which I, like millions other, am looking forward to.",7,0,0,5 May 2002
Batman Begins," Back in black and it feels so good.
","Okay, I know I'm gonna catch Hell for this, but I still love BATMAN FOREVER as my favorite Batman movie. BATMAN BEGINS, however, is a very, very, VERY close second. I just knew that they couldn't let the franchise end with the dismal BATMAN & ROBIN and I guess the best way to revive it was to go back to the beginning. Christopher Nolan of MEMENTO fame takes over the director's reins and practically gives the movie a British flavor (or would that be 'flavour'?). Christian Bale takes over as Bruce Wayne/Batman, who we first see in an Asian prison where he beats up six men attacking him. The guards then take Wayne to protective custody, 'I don't need protection!' Wayne tells them. 'Not you,' a guard tells Wayne, 'Them.' referring to the now unconscious prisoners. Wayne is then trained in the art of ninjitsu by Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe) and his right hand man Henri Duchard (Liam Neeson). Duchard tries to get Wayne to the point where he will kill for justice, Wayne doesn't want to go that far. We then see flashbacks of the night his parents were murdered as they left the opera 'Mefistofeles' (wouldn't 'Die Fledermous' (German for 'The Bat') been a better choice? just asking). Bruce feels guilty over this and almost murders his parents' killer. When he unable to, he then goes on a journey that takes him into criminal organizations around the world. This prepares him to understanding the criminal mind, Duchard and Al Ghul's training gives him the ability to fight and vanish at a moment's notice.Wayne returns home to Alfred (Michael Caine), the faithful family butler how still oversees Wayne Manor and assists him in his quest for justice. Wayne also finds out that Gotham City has now fallen into even deeper corruption under the hands of crime boss Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson, a long way from THE FULL MONTY) and Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy), who moonlights as the Scarecrow and drives Falcone's enemies insane with a fear gas. It would seem that the only two honest people left in Gotham are police Sgt. Jame Gordon (Gary Oldman) and ADA Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes), an old friend of Bruce's. We also learn that Bruce as a fear and obsession with bats stemming from a childhood incident. He adapts the bat as his symbol to give criminals a taste of his own fear. He then gets gadgets from Wayne Enterprises inventor Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), including a Batmobile that looks like the love child of a Humvee and a Lamborghini.The set designs have a real feel to them, just like the previous Batman films, only more so because some of BATMAN BEGINS was filmed right here in Chicago (ah, if only there REALLY was a monorail going down LaSalle Street . . .). Thus freeing the film from a studio-bound feel. The performances are good, especially Bale, who can snarl with the best of them. I was a little disappointed in that one of my favorite villains from the comic books, Ra's Al Ghul (whose name here is pronounced differently than it is in the comics) is only in the film for a short time. Also, some of the fight scenes could have used better editing, all we see are a blur of fist and feet. It's like showing a dancer on film but only showing his feet instead of his whole body as he moves. But, overall, BATMAN BEGINS is a good return to the Dark Knight's roots laid down by the late Bob Kane back in 1939. With Superman set to return to the big screen next year, might we start putting in our bid now for the crossover film that just HAS to get made one of these days?",9,0,0,15 June 2005
The Dark Knight," A Batman for all fans.
","In the modern era, we finally get the ultimate Batman movie. The one that most fans have been waiting for since roughly the early Eighties. Christopher Nolan, who rebooted the franchise with BATMAN BEGINS, gives us the excellent follow-up THE DARK KNIGHT. Christian Bale returns as the haunted Bruce Wayne and his caped alter ego Batman, as do Michael Caine (as loyal butler Alfred), Morgan Freeman (Lucius Fox, financial adviser and inventor), and Gary Oldman (Lt. James Gordon, who's about to get a big promotion). Maggie Gyllenhaal takes over for Katie Holmes in the role of D.A. Rachel Dawes, a much better trade, in my opinion. As in BATMAN BEGINS, Chicago once again stands in for Gotham City and the city looks even more nightmarish than it did in the previous film.Batman now has to contend with a town that has gone over the edge with both imitators (like a chubby, shotgun-toting Batman) and a new criminal: the Joker (the late Heath Ledger). Unlike the previous men who have played the Clown Prince of Crime, Ledger's Joker isn't interested so much in making a profit from his crimes, just the kick that he gets from causing havoc. I still wish that they had gone the route of the comic books and had Joker actually have white skin instead of wearing make-up, but they do a good job with what Ledger does with the character. He practically transforms the Joker into his own. Meanwhile, Rachel, after breaking up with Bruce, is now dating the new chief D.A., Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who we know is doomed to become the coin-flipping Two-Face. Batman wants Dent to be the white knight that he feels Gotham needs in order to combat villains on the order of the Joker while he is the dark knight of the title.As dark as this movie is, I certainly hope that this isn't the last we see of certain characters that were shown in this movie.",10,1,4,15 March 2009
Rocky," The 25TH Round: ROCKY at the quarter-century mark.
","It's hard to believe that it's been twenty-five years since the original ROCKY played in movie theatres!  By now, most people know about the behind-the-scenes story that was just as interesting as what happened on the screen:  Sylvester Stallone was a character actor who was having a hard time finding roles.  Till then, his biggest part has been as one of THE LORDS OF FLATBUSH.  With a pregnant wife and little money in the bank, Stallone wrote a screenplay about a down-on-his-luck heavyweight boxer who gets a million-to-one shot at the championship of the world.  When he pitched his story to United Artists, such names as Robert DeNiro, Ryan O'Neal and Burt Reynolds were brought up to play the lead.  But Stallone was adamant about one thing:  Either he played Rocky Balboa or he would destroy the script. The studio relented and a classic was made.     In fact, when the cameras began rolling on the movie, only two of its cast were well-known:  Burgess Meredith (Mickey) and Talia Shire (Adrian). Stallone and the others were seen as something of a risk, one that eventually paid off BIG.     ROCKY opens shortly before Thanksgiving, 1975.  Rocky Balboa (Stallone) is a boxer so hard-scrabble that he has to bum a cigarette from an audience member right after one of his fights.  In addition to boxing, Rocky also works as the enforcer for a low-level loan shark (Joe Spinell), a profession that doesn't sit well with Mickey Goldmill (Meredith).  Goldmill runs the gym where Rocky trains and he feels that what Rocky is doing is 'a waste of life'.  So much so that he kicks Rocky out of his gym locker for a boxer that he feels is a true contender.  At the same time, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), the heavyweight boxing champion of the world, is up a creek:  the opponent for his New Year's fight has to pull out due to injury.  No other ranked contender is available.  What to do?  Creed hits on an idea:  give a local fighter a title shot.  Creed picks Rocky because he feels heat from Balboa's nickname:  'The Italian Stallion'.  'Who discovered America?' Creed asks, 'An Italian, right?  What could be better than to get it on with one of his descendents?'     While all of this is going on, Rocky is trying to capture the attention of Adrian (Shire), the woman at the local pet shop and the sister of his best friend, Paulie (Burt Young).  Adrian is so shy that some people think that she's retarded.  Looking at Rocky trying to break down her defenses during their courtship is almost like watching him in the ring.  You have to admire his tenacity.  While he pursues a romantic relationship with Adrian, Paulie is constantly hitting Rocky up for a job with the loan shark or trying to make money off of Rocky's name after he gets the title shot.  This also gets the attention of Mickey, who now feels that Rocky has a chance to make something of his life.     Meanwhile, the champ is portrayed as so pushy that he makes Muhammad Ali (the real champ at the time of the movie's release) look humble.  Not only that, he's something of a racist as well ('[Rocky's] Italian, ain't he?' he says of his opponent, 'Which means if he can't fight, I'll bet he can cook.').  The perfect counterbalance to the truly mild-mannered (by comparison) Rocky.  The courtship between Rocky and Adrian is shown in a very sweet way.  The fight itself is one of the best ever committed to film. To say who wins would be redundant to those of us who have already seen it and spoiling of the excitement to those of you who haven't.  Just watch it for yourself and enjoy it.          As it turned out, the movie as a whole became a 'contender':  It received ten Oscar nominations, winning three (Best Director, Film Editing and Picture).  ROCKY beat out such cinematic 'heavyweights' as NETWORK, ALL OF THE PRESIDENT'S MEN and TAXI DRIVER.  Enhancing the movie is Bill Conti's great musical score which includes the song which became as much of a character as the human actors:  'Gonna Fly Now'.  In fact, after watching ROCKY, I wonder if, like me, others often find the music 'Going the Distance' playing in the back of their minds whenever they watch a real boxing match.  Especially a good match.",10,0,0,8 December 2001
The Matrix Reloaded," No improvement over the first film.
","As you may recall, mine was one of the few small voices who didn't sing the praises of THE MATRIX in 1999.  Granted, the film had a unique look to it and became heavily imitated and parodied.  But I found it to be rather pretentious in its intentions.  After viewing THE MATRIX RELOADED, all I've got to say is:  It's more of the same and not too different.  Keanu Reeves returns as Neo, the one chosen to free humanity from the enslavement of machines that are feeding off of it for power.  As before, the machines have set up defenses in the form of the reality-altering Agents led by the ever soulless Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), who now has the power to multiply himself by jamming his fingers into a person's chest and turning them into a replica.  The relationship between Neo and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) is now deepened to the point where they have a sex scene while the citizens of Zion, the last city of humans, dance in mud like an underground version of 'Soul Train'.  Reeves, Moss, Weaving and Laurence Fishburne, as Morpheus, all return from the first movie.  They are joined by Harold Perrineau as the new pilot of the Nebuchadnezzar with Nona Gaye (taking over for the late Aaliyah) as his wife.  There is also Monica Bellucci as a mystery woman who may or may not be quite on the heroes' side, Jada Pinkett-Smith as Niobe, another ship captain who had a relationship with Morpheus but is now involved with one of Zion's city leaders (Harry Lennix).    As with the first film, the stunt work and special effects are dazzling to the eye.  An opening sequence showing Trinity being chased in a freefall by Agents has to be seen to be believed as bullets (and bodies) literally go flying across the screen.  However, as with the first film, the story seems to be a little full of itself.  I understand that there are quite a lot of religious references in the MATRIX movies, but I find them to stand out like a sore thumb.  Maybe my atheism makes them go over my head.  Perhaps this movie seems so spare because it is the second in a planned trilogy.  Maybe that will make everything crystal clear when it ends.  Maybe they'll also explain why nearly everyone is wearing dark glasses when there's precious little sunlight in the movie.",2,0,0,23 May 2003
The Matrix," The longest, most expensive GAP commercial ever made!
","Okay, I know a lot of heat is going to come my way for saying this, but I'm ready.  So, here goes:  I did NOT like this movie!  I'm not saying that it's terrible, just that it didn't move me the way that it seems to have touched some people's lives.  The perpetually perplexed Keanu Reeves is Thomas aka Neo, an office grunt/computer hacker who is recruited by the mysterious Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne)to free humanity from enslavement by machines.  It seems that the world that we are living in is all an illusion provided by free-thinking computers who are using people as batteries (Can I be an ENERGIZER?  They last longer).  The only thing standing between humanity and totally servitude are the Agents, led by the soulless Agent Smith (played by Hugo Weaving in a good performance).  Agents are the only ones who seem to have the ability to alter the reality around them, making them able to do fantastic things like dodge bullets and the like.  Neo is shown that he, too, can alter the world around him when Morpheus jumps from one roof to another a block away (to which Keanu gives his signature line: 'Whoa!').  He is then trained in hand-to-hand combat, spaceship-piloting and the use of high-calibre automatic firearms. This seems to provide the film with its strong suit:  Dazzling stunts and special effects.  However, I found the story to be just a little too pretentious.  I realize that there is a lot of symbolism within the story (most of it cribbed from the New Testament), but, while watching the movie and getting the messages of the movie, I half expected to see signposts appear saying CAUTION! METAPHORS AHEAD!  I did get a kick, however, out of the street intersections mentioned in the film where all of the 'exits' were:  They are actually streets in Chicago, the Wachowski brothers' (and my) hometown.  As I said before, the special effects and stuntwork are fabulous.  In fact, I thought the film should have received Oscar nominations for its Art Direction and Costumes.  Beyond that, I thought THE MATRIX was nothing more than the longest, most expensive GAP commercial ever made.  For a better handling of this type of material, I suggest two films that could be combined to make a better MATRIX:  THE LAST DRAGON (for it's metaphysical message and martial arts action) and DARK CITY (for it's handling of a scary fantasy city under siege). Okay, let the brickbats and/or bouquets fly . . . !",4,0,1,14 August 2000
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Is this supposed to be taken seriously?
","I remember reading of Ann Rice's initial disappointment with the pending film version of her novel INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE.  She was upset at Tom Cruise being cast as the flamboyant Lestat (Rice always envisioned Rutger Hauer in the part).  She felt that Cruise would have been a better Louis and Brad Pitt, who played Louis, would have been better as Lestat.  Upon seeing a preview screening, Rice changed her opinion, publicly apologized and gave the film her seal of approval.  Not having read the novels in their entirety, I can only go by the excerpts that give the description of Lestat: Tall, slender, blond, face like an angel.  Sounds like Brad Pitt to me.  An early comic book adaptation had Louis drawn to resemble Tom Cruise (this was five years before the movie!).  After seeing the movie, all I can say is that I agree more with Rice's first opinions and that Pitt should have been Lestat and Cruise should have been Louis.     As it is, Neil Jordan's take on INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE:  THE VAMPIRE CHRONICLES plays like a bad take on Roman Polanski's FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS.  Cruise, as Lestat, acts as if he should be chewing on the scenery rather than his victims' necks as he goes horribly over the top. Pitt, as Louis, seems to be of the opinion that since Cruise is in acting overdrive, he should be in very low key and is almost comatose.  However, the big sin of the movie is that it isn't scary in the least.  Cruise comes across more like the little kid in one of those really cheap Halloween costumes who jumps out of the closet and tries to scare you.  Everything ends up looking so lifeless that it's as if real vampires may have invaded the production.     I did like the scene where Louis goes to a movie theatre to catch up on all of the sunrises that he has missed in his life via film clips from the silent classic SUNRISE to SUPERMAN:  THE MOVIE.  Christian Slater does an admirable job as the Interviewer, filling in for the late River Phoenix. While the movie as a whole disappointed me, I will say this:  I said to myself that if what happened at the end of the movie would happen, it would end on a good note.  Fortunately, Jordan got that part right . . . if nothing else.",3,12,28,17 February 2002
