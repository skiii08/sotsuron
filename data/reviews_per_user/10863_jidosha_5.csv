Casablanca," A very story and dialogue-driven movie
","A very story and dialogue-driven movie. It is indulging how the relationship between the characters is complicated. It draws you in by giving you a laugh. Keeps you interested by adding stimulating details. Continues to get your attention by touching your sentiment with romantic themes. Then complicated drama schemes are added to play with your alignment. By the third of the movie it makes you ponder who will go for who, for what, to go or stay to where and by the end you will linger why.This film makes you think about your own 'moral stance' - to love or to the world; your self or selflessness. but c'mon, there's a war breaking out , is there a line needed to be drawn in front of you as to what is really important?It's a romance film so it's about LOVE, and she is such a fickle mistress; sometimes it leaves you but when it comes running back, it's a slippery slope to hike. Then you learn that if you really love someone you know how to let them go and ultimately move on because it's for the best. This film I believe is one of the first to showcase that. But overall it also varies to how much it relates to the viewer. I know I'm guilty. I would love to see colorized version but liked it anyhow.",9,0,1,27 October 2013
Alien," definitely a sci-fi classic!
","Definitely a sci-fi classic. It is very advanced for its time regarding set design and visual effects. I may not have watched it at the time when it was out but I can imagine how it would impact the audience at that time. It's also filled with gore and violence that will make one flinch. It will also send ones pulse racing as the intense moments filled in. However, apart from all the action there's barely an adept dialogue to follow through making some scenes tedious. Evidently, i guess it's part being a thriller; slow and steady until reaching a high tensioned climax.Some moments are predictable, coz i guess my generation is jaded by the 'horror formula'. But for its time i can truly imagine it being praised to be a step forward for science fiction films as well as thriller and horror.",9,0,1,26 October 2013
The Evil Dead," just unadulterated evil
","So a party of friends play innocent in a haunting that is so out-of-the-way up the hills. A typical set up for terror. At the beginning it's easy to get lost in the character's stories, understandable for what's really in store. Just minutes it already tries to creep you, but the 'good' stuff really comes in later on. Basically the movie will try to haunt and creep you all the way to the end. It does a good job at that. The setting feels somewhat clamped in, which adds to the overall ambient horror. Acting may be cheezy and visuals korny. I enjoyed the film although they could have done things better but what more could they have done back then?Because of modern horror films of late, many may not appreciate the movie. I have to admit I can't deny being jaded. If you see beyond that then you can appreciate the smart visuals, gore and terror material, which is what highlights this movie I believe.",9,0,1,29 October 2013
Psycho," it will catch you off guard
","It will catch you off guard and shock you by the end. It seems so stimulating at the start but as the movie develops you wonder 'why am I watching this?'. It confuses you as to what the hell is going on. Awkward moments and bothersome ambient noise will blur your attention. But if you're open minded and curios enough it will set the viewer for what is really to come.what is brilliant about this is that i think it does that on purpose; to get you nonchalant. It seems like you know what is going on but it springs you off later on.Though the plot is at praise, the acting is really mediocre and the visual and sound effects may seem unsatisfying. But it was the 60's (you could say late 50's) so what could you expect? And it's kind of ludicrous to try and compare it to modern films but it's hard to refrain from that. the shower scene is really iconic as well as the intense music used.",9,0,1,27 October 2013
Am√©lie," entertaining and sweet but such a strange romance
","After watching I can't help but say that it is a strange movie. I praise the story telling method. It's much like reading a book and an explosion of images gushes out in front of you. I loved the way that it's very artistic which makes it fun to follow. But as it goes on, it may also feel redundant at times. You fall in love with the efforts made but in the end I felt uncanny. I like the story especially the small arcs in between. You'll enjoy Amelie's journey and laugh and smile along with her. But by the third to the end I felt that it lacked the stuffing needed for a good roast. Of course you will root for the romance because they are adorable, but the parley between the two will later on feel strange and overall just average. I liked the movie especially the beginning sequence. Very creative artwork and effects. But for me the story line lacked only in some aspects following the conclusion, which made me feel somewhat dissatisfied.",7,0,2,29 October 2013
