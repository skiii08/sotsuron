Mission: Impossible III," No limit for the imagination
","There's no doubt there are no limits for the imagination. As time goes by we see very well elaborated scripts making whole audiences take deep breaths in movie theatres. Actors have been paid millions to take part in great stories and very high budget productions. Seeing monsters, outer space battles, highly advanced weapons and fast and complex car pursuits is very common nowadays. Mission: Impossible III is one of these works. Tom Cruise and his crew (for he is one of the producers)get involved in this that is probably one of the best (when it comes to special effects at least) movies of 2006. It's about two hours of the finest action scenes and we just don't realise such a long time runs outside the cinema. 'Mission: impossible' is your attempt to take your eyes off the screen such are fights, shots, running and explosions that illustrate the film. Really, a high recommended option for the whole family.",9,0,0,15 May 2006
Catch Me If You Can," Campina Grande
","This movie is better than I thought it would be. I saw this during carnival here in Brazil, since I don't like the party very much. It's great, and maybe it's all I can tell about this film, directed by Steven Spielberg and starred by three great actors: Leonardo Di Caprio, Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken. There's no need to say their performances are fabulous.The plot is really interesting. We never know what is gonna happen next, and that's something that gets our attention during the whole movie.",9,0,1,18 March 2003
Fight Club," Intelligent film!
","When I first sae this movie (at the cinema four years ago) I understood why it caused so much discussions worldwide. There is a little of everything in 'Fight Club': violence, love, humour, adventure, action and fantasy. It also has a little of art in here, once the actors talk directly to us while the movies goes on. The first minutes are a bit of confusing and they are not so attractive. However, after we get in the mood of this masterpiece, we enjoy what we see, but not the way great director David Fincher wanted us to. I conclude this due to the great surprise we discover in the end... and what a surprise!Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, two of everybody's favourite actors are very well in this film. They make us believe in their roles and their characters are powerful and real. Highly recommended film!my rate 9/10",8,0,1,13 April 2003
Citizen Kane," That's a hard one
","Maybe the fact I'm Brazilian made me feel a little confused about this film. I wasn't born in the USA and I'm only 28 years old, so I think it's hard for me to feel so impressed by this film that is about someone I had never heard about. I'm sure my opinion would be different if I had lived the days the movies deals about or if I was American and had always heard about Mr. Kane.Anyway, analysing 'Citizen Kane' as a film... I may say I liked it. It's black and white and the images are bad, but it just brings some kind of beauty to this documentary / drama movie picture. Orson Welles is great again. His performance is just unforgettable.",8,0,2,23 February 2004
Memento," Simply great!
","The confusing plot and thrilling scenes of actions are the characteristics of this great film starred by Guy Pearce and directed by Christopher Nolan. Everything is showed backwards on the movie, what makes it impossible to take the eyes off the screen during the whole film. End is actually in the first scene and the beginning is in the last one. It's an enchanting innovation that can't be missed at all. Lenny (Guy Pearce) is a desperate man who wants to discover who killed his wife during his house robbery. Because of a blow he received in the head in the attack he has to use notes, pictures and tattoos on his own body to remember what he has just done and to know who people are. Many other characters enter the story what confuses Lenny who don't know if he can trust them or not. We who watch the movie also have to pay close attention to what is happening not to miss the important details that explain the plot.Guy Pearce together with Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano, who play two of those mysterious characters Lenny must investigate about, have great performances in this unforgettable and highly recommended film. In my opinion, the high position `Memento' has in the 250 rank here in IMDb shows how good this movie is.",10,0,1,17 April 2002
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," Another romance during World War II
","Although it's not a wonderful movie, it surprises us a little due to it's setting. The story happens during World War II but in Greece, different from many others films of this genre. The main fact of it is love triangle, not bombs and shots (although you'll see them in the last minutes).In a small Greek island, Pelagia (Penélope Cruz) loves Mandras(Christian Bale) and they are engaged and hope to have a happy life ahead. However their plans are postponed when he goes to war against Italy in Albania. Their victory is suffocated by the Germans who attack and take the island and give its control to the Italians. While Mandras is far in the battlefields, Pelagia falls in love with Italian Captain Corelli, putting her engagement in risk. The rest is STORY...My Rate 7/10",6,1,4,11 November 2002
Ted," Better than it seems
","When I read the plot I went 'what on Earth are they trying to say with this movie?' Then I thought 'Ok, it must be just another comedy'. Well, I was not wrong with these thoughts, but there is a bit more than those superficial expectations here. But NO! This is far (very far) from being a fantastic film! But it is more than a boring fool funny thing. Lots of the dialogues take us to some reflection and quite a few situations make us remember things like 'I've been through this before'.Mark Wahlberg's performance is good and Seth MacFarlane's voices fit the teddy bear well. Sam Jones' participation is very funny.",6,0,0,20 June 2018
The Irishman," Another masterpiece
","It's one more movie about crime. And it's impressive (amazing? surprising? revolting? shocking?) how mafia crime films attract people to the movie theaters. Well, this is another thing to discuss at anther forum.The thing is that Scorsese gives us, for the 1000th time or more, that he really can make films. By far one of the best director ever.Starring this great and long film the one I like to see as my favourite actor: Robert De Niro. This guy can play any kind of role hands down.Together with him, Al Pacino, who is also a great actor who speaks through his eyes and expressions.And then we come to Joe Pesci. Ok, we have always known he's a very good actor. But in this movie he does in masterly. In one of the scenes (I'm not going to spoil anything) his character is not talking. He just looks at De Niro while he talks to Keitel (who is in another of his generally great performances) talking. But Pesci's face tells us everything. It is something like 'I told you, man'. Genius' work.",7,2,6,12 January 2020
Alexander," Alxander was a human being
","Everybody has watched many epics where the protagonist was a hero. In almost all of them, the hero is like an unbreakable man who could kill lots of enemies and fight battles as a lion. Great, this is wonderful and it fits the historical knowledge we have about them. Alexander was shown as this strong man in that wonderful film starred by Richard Burton in the 1950's.Oliver Stone, however, decided to make something knew: show Alexander the Great in his human side. His life is told since his birth until his death, without leaving behind things that may be common in someone's life, like love and fear.Alexander's mother is shown as a woman who always wanted her son to rule the world. She believed this would make her powerful as well. This eager for power made her try to control Alexander, who was obviously uncomfortable with it.Alexander was also shown in his homosexual life (something ignored in the version with Richard Burton). This may spoil the hero symbol for some people who don't like gays...But this version by Oliver Stone has lots of battles, just like this kind of movie must have. And these fights are really well done. Sometimes they are shocking because of the violence that is shown.The cast is great. Angelina Jolie, Anthony Hopkins, Val Kilmer, Christopher Plummer and Colin Farrell as the protagonist. I liked their performances a lot.My rate 8/10",8,1,7,13 February 2005
Troy," Really good film
","'Troy' had everything a film needs to be loved: a star (Brad Pitt) in the role of a warrior, what makes teenagers happy; a classical story to please the lovers of literature; lots of fighting scenes, to attract the fans of violent movies, and a good love story. This formula, again, had success.Paris (Orlando Bloom), prince of Troy, falls in love with Helen (Diane Kruger), the wife of a king. Their love is so big that makes Paris take Helen back to Troy. This makes the king angry. He calls his brother Agamemnom (Brian Cox) and his army. Agamemnon, decided to take Troy under his command, goes to Troy with many warriors. Aquilles (Brad Pitt), the best of all the Greek warriors,is invited to go to the war too. He hates Agamemnon, but at the same time he's interested in the glory this conflict could bring to his name. Petersen's direction is wonderful. He really takes to the screen much of the beauty of the poem. It's obvious that not everything that Homer wrote is in Petersen's film, but we can't forget text is text and movie is movie.My Rate 10/10",10,0,2,31 May 2004
We Were Soldiers," Just great!
","I have no doubt this is one of the best movies about war I have seen. This much more than just seeing scenes where soldiers lose their lives under the bombing of the enemies. This is a drama where talented actors (mainly Gibson) show how good they are. The direction is great, actually, surprising, due to the cameras takings and angles characters are shown. Not to be missed!!!",9,3,6,18 March 2003
Full Metal Jacket," One of the best war ever
","No doubt Stanley Kubrick is one of the best directors cinema has ever known. In his life, he made things like 'Spartacus', an excellent gladiator, '2001: A Space Odyssey', a wonderful sci-fi film, 'Lolita', a sexy and hot romance, 'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb', an ironical masterpiece, 'A Clockwork Orange', a portrait of a possible future and this 'Full Metal Jacket', considered by many the best war movie ever made.The film seems to be two different movies put into one. The first part shows the privates training in an island in the USA. Commanded by a brave, and sometimes cruel, man, the soldiers are often called 'maggots' and they have to face really hard exercises. Some of them, like private Pyle, suffer from the pains and difficulties of their duties.The second part is the war itself in Vietnam. Through the eyes of Private Joker (Matthew Modine), who writes to the press about the situation in the battlefield, we see the war from a very true point of view. We feel like we are there in the platoon and sometimes and have the feeling we are soldiers ourselves.Highly recommended.",10,1,1,28 May 2006
The Bourne Identity," Action!!!
","Definitely this is not a brilliant movie. The plot has nothing new and scenes are exactly like many others in cinema history. But it doesn't mean 'Bourne Identity' is bad. Not at all. Matt Damon, who has shown his talented in many movies is good as the protagonist. Frank Potente, as beautiful and talented as always, co-stars it very well too. This film is ideal to be seen in a movie theatre for the good quality if the sound and the guaranteed fun.",7,0,1,10 November 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The saga starts
","If you`re one those who think there are no good adventure films nowadays, surprise! You`re completely wrong! Try the trilogy 'Lord of the Rings' and change your opinion. I recommend the three parts of the adventure, cause they just mean something when you watch them as a whole. You gotta be patient and forget all your other activities for one or two days, for each one of the parts lasts more the 3 hours!!! In spite of all that, you'll enjoy what you see. The films are very well directed and the actors are good. There are lots of well done scenes of fights, but the violence is also in excess. The computer effects are really well used and they give the movies some special charm. My Rate 8/10",9,0,1,9 August 2004
The Matrix Revolutions," Not so good as the first ones, but still great!
","It was Wednesday morning, Matrix revolutions world opening... there I was in a long line waiting for the film to start. It was nice to see so many people standing there and trying to guess what would happen and how the story would end. I heard the most incredible stories in the world. There were little kids, teens, young and not so young adults and even some elder people. Everybody had the same aim: see Matrix. I confess I felt a little sad when the movie was over I didn't see some of the things I expected so much, but still... Matrix Revolutions is really good. It has more scenes outside the Matrix, and the battles are more connected to the real world, so I think it gives us more sense of the real world. Actually I don't know if it's good (because watching the action inside the Matrix was so good), but it makes this third film different from the other ones. Anyway, I liked it!my rate 8/10",8,0,0,10 January 2004
We're the Millers," Not that cliche. Good!
","When the film starts we feel it is one of those hundreds of American comedies. Well, it is not that wonderful thing, but it is funny and has some twists, that give points to the final grade. I liked it.",6,0,1,12 January 2020
Apocalypse Now," Breath-taking!
","War has been the theme of many of the greatest movies of all times, such as Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket', Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan', Stone's 'Platoon' and Coppola's 'Apocalypse Now'. These films  are living examples of Hollywood passion for military conflict, mainly World War II and Vietnam War. It's interesting how we can never ignore this movies, full of battles, shots and explosions.     I'm sure it's not easy for the directors to rule such big projects where a numerous cast is involved and millions of dollars are spent. We can't deny these characteristics attract us, once we realise we have seen all the cited movies lots of times.     'Apocalypse Now' is something we just cannot miss at all. Coppola's direction is wonderful and the cast counts on Marlon Brandon, Robert Duvall, Martin Sheen, Laurence Fishbourne, Dennis Hopper and Harrison Ford. The plot itself is different from anything we have seen in the genre of films: Col. Walter E. Kurtz (Brando) is a dissident officer who lives somewhere in Asia leading his own army and obeying his own laws. This makes Capt. Benjamin L. Willard (Sheen) goes out in a mission to get Kurtz. This itself could be enough to make 'Apocalypse Now' great, but then we see the wonderful performances Brando, Duvall and Sheen have. Not to be missed.My rate 9/10",9,3,3,28 November 2002
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," I wanna be a wizard too!
","Ok, this is just a joke. Of course I can´t and I wouldn´t be a wizard. But it would be good if I had the power. Being at Hogwarts would certainly be a great adventure!!! As you can see, I really loved this third Harry Potter´s adventure. It´s intelligent and has lots of action. For the first time, the novel had some of its facts left out. Alfonso Cuaron didn´t do as Chris Columbus did. He selected the most important facts and turned them into this great movie picture. I´m not criticizing Columbu`s job. The first film (made by him) is the best of the already released three ones. But Cuaron had to work with the slowest paced story of all the novels about Potter. Cuaron also created a dark atmosphere. Everything is dark all long the story. There`s also lots of special effects and supernatural facts.
My rate 8/10",8,0,0,3 July 2004
The Usual Suspects," Very Good, but far from being brilliant.
","This that kind of movie we watch e probably never forget it. Very interesting plot, good acting, good direction and a surprising, but wonderful end. You have certainly seen better thriller than this one, but it's worth watching. I really don't know if it deserves being in such a high position in the 250 best movies list here in IMDb. Actually I'm quite sure it shouldn't be there.Anyway, this movie is fun and makes you think about it in the end...that's all. I rate it 8 out of 10 because of the whole value of the movie.",8,1,3,16 July 2002
The Dirty Dozen," Not to be missed!
",This is not just another war movie. It's simply a classic movie with strong drama connotation and good performances. Lee Marvin (may God rest his soul) and Charles Bronson proved they were really good actors.Very good screenplay and effects.,8,0,2,1 November 2002
The Pianist," Fantastic!
","It's impossible to say how many movies about II World War have been made up to now. Many of them are really brilliant, and many are just a bunch of stupidity. 'The Pianist' is much more than just a good film, it's different from most of things we have already seen. Instead of showing platoons suffering in the battlefield, this film shows a lonely man lost in Warsaw, the capital of Poland, occupied by the Nazis for the six years of war.The direction is breathtaking. The position of the cameras and the way facts are shown make we think about the story for hours and hours. Adrien Brody, who got the Oscar for this role, is really brilliant. His face expressions really make we believe in him. My rate 10/10",10,0,1,6 April 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Getting better and better
","First of all, I liked 'Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'. It's great. But I think this second coming is better. And the third is the best.But I'll talk about the second one. It's a huge thing. I'm not only considering the length of the movie, but it's quality and big production. The scenes are really well done, specially the battles. I know technology helped to make them even greater, but I do think we should clap our hands for those scenes. The performances are great, specially Wood's.If you haven't seen the first movie, don't lose any minute and do it. Then, as it's over, try to look for this one, and then go for the third. With the whole trilogy on your mind, you'll know how great 'Lord of the Rings' is.My rate 8/10",9,0,0,4 September 2004
The Elephant Man," highly recommended
","I have always thought Anthony Hopkins is the best actor cinema has ever seen. When I watched this film, I just found one more reason to think it. He is just perfect in one more character, in this case, the doctor of a hospital in London, England whose routine changes when he finds (in a circus) a man with a terrible deformity in his body. The tumours in his skin and the scaring problems in his bones make him look like an elephant. The doctor takes the elephant man to the hospital and takes care of him. He also treats the poor lad with love and care, and it makes him feels good. John Hurt is superb as the elephant man, and his performance must have taken some awards.The film was totally done in black and white, and it certainly contributes to give it a dark and old look, what perfectly matches with the atmosphere of the story. This is also an important factor to make the elephant man even more terrifying.",8,0,0,2 January 2006
School of Rock," A great (and funny) tribute to rock and roll
","There some good films about rock n' roll. Some are great and they are a great tribute to this, that is simply the best kind of music ever created. 'School of Rock' may not be the best movie about this music style, but it's really funny. Jack Black, again, proves he's a good actor and a great singer. He plays a musician who has no money but needs some dollars to pay his bills. Suddenly, he receives a phone call where the principal of a traditional junior high school invites his roommate to be their teacher for some weeks. The musician sees in it the chance to get some money, so he uses his friend's name and starts working with a group of kids. Since singing and playing are the only things he knows, he decides to teach rock n' roll to the kids.All long the film we listen to great songs by bands like Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, AC/DC, Led Zeppelin and many others. We also see some videos by these gods of rock. Jack Black's character also talks about some successful rock n roll CDs by Rush, Pink Floyd and some others.This movie is a great gift for all those who like rock n roll.My rate 8/10",8,1,1,4 September 2004
Amadeus," Fabulous!
","Mozart's story is beautifully told in this 'Amadeus'. I have never talked to someone who has watched and not enjoyed it. The performances are striking and Milos Forman's direction is really good. Watching this movie is not just having a good time, but also listening to extremely good music and learning about Mozart. 'Amadeus' is a diving into the life of one of the best composers who ever existed. It's that kind of movie you must watch late at night, when there's no telephone calls, door bells or noise outside your window. The way the story is not, that is in flashback, gives a irresistible flavour of reality to it. A Mozart's (Tom Hulce) rival, Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), tells us everything he remembers about the composer. It's a kind of trip to the past, when music was made from the heart and soul.
My rate 9/10",9,1,3,23 November 2002
The Game," What a birthday gift!
","This is certainly one of the most intelligent films I have watched. It's a big action one with a great surprise in the end. It's Sean Penn, one of the best actors in the world, in a good performance and Michael Douglas good as well. I first watched it back in 1997 or 1998. Now I'm watching it again. It's worth watching again! So get this film and enjoy it!My rate 8/10",8,0,1,22 January 2004
The Last Emperor," A Must See
","Among the many kinds of films, biographical dramas are the ones which generally result in great movies. Well, at least the ones directed by great movie makers like Bertolucci.'The Last Emperor' is great because, besides Bertolucci's direction, it has a plot that catches our attention since minute one and things flow naturally all through the 2h 43 of projection.Also, 'The Last Emperor' has beautiful photograph, good acting and an interesting historical background to lean on.Worth watching!",8,0,0,11 March 2017
Mission: Impossible II," Really good!
","'Mission: Impossible II' is a typical action movie! There's all you want when you watch a film of this genre: motor bikes, explosions, fights and an atmosphere of danger in the air. The central plot is quite fictitious, but it's good! I felt it lost something important when compared to the first movie, the art itself. De Palma's direction, besides the wonderful scenes of action, added some mystery and beauty to the story, something John Woo couldn't do. It's something too subjective to be described in a few lines, but watching this second movie makes we realise De Palma and Woo have different points of view. This is positive, because we can compare them and make our conclusions. 'Mission: Impossible II', although without De Palma's style, is really good. The story is carefully built and it proves John Woo is one of the best action film directors we have nowadays. The scene where Tom Cruise's character and the bad guy take part in a motor bike pursuit is brilliant.
My rate 8/10",8,0,0,7 April 2003
"Girl, Interrupted"," Great film
","I agree the central plot is not that wonderful and it's been seen a million times before and I agree 'Girl, Interrupted' is not people's favourite film. However, this is good...very good. Angelina Jolie again proves she's a great actress. Her performance is one of the best she has ever shown in her career. Winona Ryder and Brittany Murphy are very well too.",8,1,1,8 April 2003
Mission: Impossible," Brilliant!
","Brilliant! Breath-taking! Thrilling! These are some of the words that describe 'Mission: Impossible'. The plot is really interesting, although it may seem confusing if we take our eyes off the screen for some seconds. Brian De Palma, one of my favourite directors, adds one more masterpiece to his career. The cast, leaded by Tom Cruise in a great role, has important names as Jon Voight, Jean Reno, Vanessa Redgrave, Emilio Estevez and Kristin Scott Thomas. Emmanuelle Béart is also great. Definitely not to be missed!My rate 9/10",9,3,6,13 November 2002
Reservoir Dogs," Quick and straight to the point
","I've seen many of Tarantino's films, so I knew what was to come in this 'Reservoir Dogs'. Many people (I'm not included in this group) don't like his movies because of the violence, slangs and dirty words. In my opinion this is just a real display of what happens in many parts the world nowadays. Of course Tarantino and his intelligence exaggerate in some things, but this is just to mock these tragedies and give his works a taste of irony. There's always something funny in his pictures. In this 'Reservoir Dogs' we laugh when the criminals discuss their nicknames, a few moments before starting a robbery.   Tarantino, in my opinion, belongs to the same group Woody Allen, Pedro Almodovar and a few others do: the geniuses of cinema. Many people don't easily understand what they do (are these directors worried about it?) but I just think these guys have a lot (of good things) to say and show us.",8,1,3,21 January 2004
Some Like It Hot," wonderful
","If you like comedies this is the movie you're looking for. 'Some Like It Hot' is one of the best comedies cinema has ever made, not only because of the plot itself, but because of the great direction by Billy Wilder and the great performances of Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, two very good actors. Marilyn Monroe and all her beauty is also an important part in it.
Two musician witness the murder of some people and they are then chased by the killers, the local mob. The only way they see to escape is getting a job in a girls band. To do it, they have to dress just like ladies and keep their man behaviour hidden. From this moment on, we see hilarious scenes and unforgettable moments. My rate 9/10",9,1,1,16 November 2002
Detroit Rock City," Rock n' Roll
","If you're a KISS fan, you just CAN NOT MISS IT. If you're not, you can't miss it either. 'Detroit Rock City' is a great adventure, comedy and even romance movie, where some fans of KISS decide to go to a concert of their favourite band. They face lots of adventures during their attempt to get there, but they never give up the show. Who would?The soundtrack, of course, is full of KISS songs, so as we watch the film we hear some of our favourite tunes!!! We also listen to some other bands in 'Detroit Rock City', so it's really great for rock and roll fans.
The scene of the show is fabulous. My rate 7/10",7,1,4,17 July 2002
The Da Vinci Code," Well done
","If you are one of those people who never watch an adapted film because you think it will never be better than the novel it is based on, think twice. OK, again, the novel is better, but at least this time the result is good, and it is worth watching. First, it is good to see Tom Hanks in action, second, the director Ron Howard, did a good job.The first minutes are incredibly fast, and it may confuse people who haven't read the book. The ones who know the novel, people like me for example, may have to think of the the original text sometimes, but it does not damage the movie as a whole.As someone who has read the novel and seen the film, as well as a Christ believer and highly interested in history, I say we have to be always ready to learn and know fact that may (or may not) take us to the truth, no matter if sometimes we have to redo our own faith.",8,0,4,19 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Quite Funny
","For the ones who have read the book in which this film is based this is a funny, enchanting and good movie. For the people who haven't read the novel by J.K. Rowling it may be fool and empty.The story is about Harry, an ordinary kid who is an orphan and lives his some relatives who hate him a lot. Everything changes and he is told he is a famous wizard in another world to which he must go to start his studies on Witchcraft and then face the dangerous Lord Voldemort, who killed his parents and wants to control Hogwarts School.Chris Columbus, who have directed quite a few movies for the whole family, did a great work when adapting the story for the cinema. It's obvious that some details brought on the novel are not included on the film, but the cinema version of Harry Potter's saga pleasing and full of magic anyway. Many things happen on the big screen just like we imagine when reading the book. Highly recommended for everybody who wants to have fun and light entertainment.",9,0,0,14 April 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," Simply wonderful
","It's not common to find a movie that puts together a great production and intelligence together. It's even harder to find something that has the two of these elements in such good shape as 'The Matrix Reloaded' does. We still haven't seen the third film, but I'm sure this trilogy is much more than just an action one. Even if it was, it would be brilliant, once the fighting and car crash scenes are beautifully done. Matrix is something that unites greatly action adventures with highly intelligent philosophical dialogues. While some people may feel bored during the minutes the characters discuss things like chance, choice, cause and consequence, some others, like me, just can't avoid feeling good at those speeches. 'Matrix' is different from anything we have seen before. It's much more than just one more good movie. It's an evidence smart cinema is still there and it's our hope that some other directors also make something deeper that challenges our perception of reality and makes some of our dreams and illusion come true. Just like 'Matrix' did. When it comes to perception of reality, 'Matrix' made me remember Jostein Gaarner's 'Sophie's World', one of the best books I ever read, where the protagonist said adults could not accept things that go against daily routine and the old tellings they have always heard from others. 'Matrix' is really a philosophy lesson. My rate 10 out of 10",10,0,0,26 May 2003
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Good, but not as the first one
","When I knew 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' was about to come to the movie theatres, I didn't think twice and decide I would see it as soon as I could. It was hard to but my ticket due to the long lines at the box offices, but I did it! I had my ticket and I went inside the room.I had read the book and I had seen the first movie, so I expected a lot from this second adventure of the little wizard and his pals. I must confess it disappointed a little bit. The film is good, but it loses some of this magic when compared to the first one. The book isn't as good as the first either.Anyway, it's worthy watching 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'. Columbus is a great director and he does a good job. The problem, in my opinion, was the lack of new things. Everything we see in this movie was seen in the first one. My rate 7/10",7,0,1,3 July 2004
The Terminal," Tom Hanks is great
","If anyone still doubted Tom Hanks talent, 'The Terminal' came to prove Hanks is one of the best actors ever! After masterpieces like 'Apollo 13', 'Philadelphia', 'Forrest Gump' and 'Cast Away' he comes up with another excellent performance. This time he is great as a man whose a fictitious country is in a kind of war (or something like it) which keeps him from coming back home and stepping out of JFK airport. Once he doesn't speak English he cannot communicate with others, and his creativity is the only instrument he has to make people understand him. With very good facial expressions and body language, Hanks makes Navorsky, his character, get our full time attention.

The Shawshank Redemption," One of the best movies ever
","If you haven`t seen this film, watch it as soon as you can. Maybe you`ve had the chance to do it, but just skipped it because you thought it was one more story in prison. Yes and no! YES because most part of 'Shawshank Redemption' happens in a prison, but NO, it's not like the others. It's much better.The story, you may know more of it in the Plot Outline, is really interesting and the performances are just impossible to forget. There is a little of everything: drama, friendship, violence, love and dream...'Dream of Freedom'. That's the title in Portuguese.My Rate 9/10",9,1,2,28 July 2004
Carrie," Enough to have a good time
","'Carrie' is not and unforgettable movie, but it is good enough to make people sit back and enjoy 100 minutes of talented Sissy Spacek, playing the protagonist who has the power to make things move by using the power of her mind. It's not the first or last movie about telekinesis, but Spacek's achievement and De Palma's direction makes it good and enjoyable.Nothing but a simple 'senior prom' movie in the first half, 'Carrie' becomes an interesting thriller in the last 30 minutes or so. Actually it may be considered a terror movie, but with no exaggeration in the visual effects. Of course it was made 26 years ago, but tons of make up and blood wouldn't fit 'Carrie'. It would certainly spoil the plot.John Travolta, Amy Irwing and Nancy Allen, young actors at the time, are also in this movie. My rate 7/10",7,0,0,22 April 2002
Ben-Hur," Fantastic!
","I think it's almost impossible not to love this wonderful movie starred by Charlton Heston. It's brilliant plot, very good performances and remarkable direction. It's just unforgettable!Charlton Heston is competent as Judah Ben-Hur, a man who's betrayed by his long time friend who wants to be powerful and sends Ben-Hur to prison just to be feared by people. What we see after this movie picture is a show of great actors playing their roles beautifully and making 'Ben-Hur' one of the best films ever made. It wasn't easy to make such epic in the late 50's. Technology was poor and shooting outside was a big problem. However, William Wyler directed this movie in a master way and made it as well as it could be. There aren't many directors who could make another 'Ben-Hur' even with the knowledge and equipment we have today. My rate 10/10",10,2,4,15 April 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The saga comes to the end!
","After a long journey full of adventure and dangerous situations, the story is over. I don`t know if this third part of 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy should be in such high position in the Top 250 rank (#3), but it`s  a really good movie. In my opinion, better than the two first parts. Actually, the trilogy got better as they release each film. Great isn't it?Again we get astonished as we see the visual effects and the fights movements. They're so well done! It's not crazy to say it's hard to find such a good movie in this genre. In 'The Return of the King' we can find more than just fights and violence. OK, this is not a drama plot, but we have some moments without blood spilling. The end, of course I will not describe it here, fits the whole saga. 'Lord of the Rings' is good from the very beginning to last second. It's really worth watching. My Rate 10/10",10,1,2,28 July 2004
The Matrix," Amazing!!!!
","'Matrix' is certainly different from anything else you have ever seen before. Full of surprises and action, the plot gets your attention from the beginning to the end of the film. Wachowski Brothers greatly directed this movie with an enchanting creativity that made 'Matrix' an innovating film, full of incredible sounds and visual effects. Keanu Reeves is Neo, a hacker who is invited by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) to discover what Matrix is. Curious about it, he accepts the invitation and enters a world of pure action and adventure. Beautiful Carrie-Ann Moss plays Trinity, who helps Neo out in his discovery.
Wanna know what 'matrix' is? Sit back and enjoy it!My rate 9/10",10,0,0,16 April 2002
Hart's War," Surprising!
","There's nothing better than being positively surprised by a movie. That's exactly what happens to us after watching 'Hart's War'. At first sight, it's nothing but one war movie full of shots, explosion and deaths. But once the first minutes go on we seen how we misjudged the film. What would be an empty movie, becomes a drama with interesting and mysterious happenings. 
'Hart's War' proves Bruce Willis is much more than just an action-movie-actor. His performance here is good and he is certainly going towards the best moments of his career. I must also say the plot is great! The surprise in the end is remarkable!My Rate 8/10",8,1,2,4 November 2002
Click," ooooops! That was close!
","This is one of those films you watch with the feeling you could have lost your money when you bought the ticket. No, it's not bad, bad you keep the opinion you could have done something better than sitting there and seeing it. 'click' tries to be more than a comedy sometimes, and these are the most boring moments of the film. It's good when it is just an uncommitted comedy and it sucks when it tries to become a tiring drama. I don't know why some producers and directors try to make their movies bigger than they could really be and make a simple job become a collection of genres that, in the end, don't tell us much. 'Click' is not that bad, but I still think it could have been lighter and less worried about giving so much messages and values. It simply doesn't belong to (good) comedies.",6,3,6,14 August 2006
Sin City," Another Rodriguéz-Tarantino like figure
","Another Rodriguéz-Tarantino like figureWhat could we expect from a Tarantino film? What could we expect from a Rodriguéz film? And better still, what could we expect from a Rodriguéz film in which Tarantino was a (very) special guest director? The answer is simple: a great film. These two men way of making movie was enhanced by Frank Miller, who also sat on the director's chair and made Sin City one of the most interesting film in the season. The idea is just brilliant  bring to the big screen the old graphic novel Sin City, made by Miller. When we see the film, we have the feeling we're reading a superhero HQ, due to the black and white images, the great photograph and even the dialogue and facial expressions of the characters, abnormal sometimes and not connected to the ones we see in cinema. The story happens in the fictitious city of Basin City (or just Sin City), that is a place full of criminals, prostitutes, drunk people and all kinds of anti-heroes. The police is just one of the authorities of the place, that is also ruled by 'The Girls', a group of beautiful and sexy women who wear small pieces of clothes and use high-tech guns to protect themselves. Their leader is Gail (Rosario Dawson), who commands also Miho (Devon Aoki), a kind of lady samurai who can kill anyone in just a second. In this complex game there's also a new and mysterious third force that will disturb the respect the two other powers have between them. In this reign of crime live eccentric beings shown in three stories. One of them is Marv (Mickey Rourke), who falls in love with Goldie (Jaime King), a prostitute. The other type is Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a policeman who has many problems in his personal life, but has in Nancy (Jessica Alba), the reason to live. The last, but not least, is Jackie Boy (Benício del Toro), a man who tries to renew the relationship with his ex-girlfriend Shellie (Brittany Murphy), a waitress of a bar that is visited by all these people. Shellie, however is with Dwight (Clive Owen), who will not accept Jackie Boy's attempts to get closer to his girl.",9,0,1,15 September 2005
The Godfather," Wonderful!!!!
","Considered by many people (including the top 250 rank here in IMDb) as the best film in history, 'The Godfather' is that kind of movie you just can't miss. Where else can we find great actors like Marlo Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan? In part II Robert De Niro enhances this trilogy even more.The story is about Vito Corleone (Brando) who is the leader of a New York Mafia family, The Corleone, that make money with gambling.His son Michael (Pacino) doesn't feel like taking part in this life although he's often invited to by his father.Vito Corleone has even more problems when he doesn't want to take part in drug business and when he sees that there's no one to substitute him in the family leadership.My rate 10/10",10,2,5,11 April 2002
