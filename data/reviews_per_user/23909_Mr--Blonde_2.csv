The Ring," Fantastic, great new direction for horror.
","Finally, a horror film the makers can be proud of.A remake of the Japanese hit Ringu, this movie is one of the few Western horrors recently that make the genre look good. Starring Naomi Watts as journalist Rachel Kellar and Martin Henderson as her ex-flame Noah.After Rachel's niece Katie dies mysteriously, Katie's mother asks Rachel to investigate. She soon discovers that 3 of Katie's friends are also dead, exactly a week after they shared a cabin and saw a videotape. Soon Noah and their son, Aidan (David Dorfman) are also dragged into it after Rachel watches the tape, giving her one week to unravel the mystery of the videotape.The movie doesn't give into cheap scares like killers jumping out at you, which unfortunatly leads people to think that it isn't scary when the frightening themes and images are what make it true horror. This movies is only slightly bettered by the original, but is still a great film.4/5 stars",8,1,1,10 March 2004
The Shining," 4/5
","This movie near perfectly adapts the Stephen King novel of the same name. Jack Nicholson is in a signature role (Heh heh, I got that off the back of the DVD!) as John/Jack Torrance, a once succesful writer now struggling to get on track after battling alchoholism. He and his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and son Danny (Danny Lloyd) are looking after a motel called The Overlook during the winter. Over a period of a few months, they are apparently haunted by apparitions and ghosts, and Jack Torrence eventually becomes increasingly insane while his son Danny senses things his parents can't with his Shining, a psychic gift.A creepy movie, you will have to watch carefully to fully interpret it's story, and when you do everything suddenly makes sense!",Null,0,1,2 January 2004
