First Man," It's not called 'First Men' - this is Armstrong's story... and it's compelling.
","This is a biography of Neil Armstrong - hence the title. There's a lot of criticism that there is too much focus on him and his 'brooding' character, but then again it is his biography - it's not called 'First Men'.Leave your prejudices about those involved in one of humanity's greatest expeditions at the door and settle in to the story of one man and how he related to those around him. It's not the story of the Space Race, it's the story of Armstrong's. And it's compelling.Saw this at IMAX and everything in medium shot or further range is great, but IMAX is not the greatest setting for hand held close ups of talking heads.
Film grain is also exaggerated.My suggestion is to see at a standard cinema first and then rewatch at IMAX to enjoy again.",9,0,1,20 October 2018
