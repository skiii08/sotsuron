Ford v Ferrari," FORD V FERRARI - MASTERPIECE OF THE CAR MOVIES
","Ford v Ferrari was a really special experience for me. I am not a person who is related to the cars, but this movie made me feel like a pilot. My adrenaline went crazy while I was watching the race scenes ( or should I say I was experiencing them ). Ford v Ferrari was like a virtual reality racing game. Cinematography, sound efects, visual efects and soundtracks made the experience so realistic. Christian Bale and Matt Damon are both GREAT actors and in this movie their performances are Oscar-nomination worthy ( especially Christian Bale ). In a nutshell, It's been an exciting and enjoyable 152 minutes. The directors and the actors did a great job and adapted this rivalry to the big screen. When I got out of the theatre, I was thinking about how much the audience need this kind of movies.",10,3,7,17 November 2019
Avengers: Endgame," A worthy conclusion to a legendary adventure
","Avengers: Endgame is not a perfect movie but it is a perfect drama for the fans. ( Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansonn, Chris Hemsworth and Robert Downey Jr. live the movie. They perform perfectly. ) This movie targets the fans, so if you are not a fan I don't advise it. There are a lot of details for the fans. You will feel the fan services in your veins. With an epic final battle, Avengers: Endgame satisfies the fans. It makes sad, it makes happy, it causes excite. It closes a saga and opens a new one for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I love MCU 3000, I love this movie 3000.",9,3,5,28 September 2019
