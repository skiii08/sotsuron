The Blair Witch Project," the worst film i have viewed
","of the 10,000 or more films i have viewed in the past 55 years, this is the very worst one. it is the ONLY film i started to walk out of after the first 15 minutes (i should have - it was a total waste of time). this film MAY have been OK if it was edited down to less that 15 minutes (the first 5 minutes, a middle 30 seconds and the last 5 minutes). the concept was good but the execution was REALLY REALLY bad. just goes to show you, if you hype something the right way people will flock tog",1,1,3,28 August 1999
